JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: THE MAGNET METROPOLIS; 
</P>
<P>
THE CALL OF THE CITY IS STILL MORE POWERFUL THAN THE LURE OF WHOLESOME RURAL 
LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
THERE IS A GROWING literature in the American press on the horrors of living in 
Los Angeles and the advantages of living elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
As an Angeleno, I am certainly not hostile to this trend. Anything that will 
discourage people from moving here will help stave off our collapse. 
</P>
<P>
One needs only to visit Cairo to see what Los Angeles will become in 10 years 
unless more of our citizens decide to move to Oregon, Nevada, Arizona or even 
North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, my wife and I drove through North Dakota and stayed overnight 
at a motel in Fargo. I have never seen an American town so bleak. There was a 
swimming pool behind the motel, but it was uninhabited. Not only did a cold 
wind make the pool forbidding, but it also blew over all the deck chairs. It 
was a wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
But North Dakota has its defenders. My old friend Rocky Spicer recalls that he 
grew up in Valley City, N.D., and sends me a letter written to the editor of a 
Valley City newspaper by a girl, Andrea Sather, 15, whose family left 
California to live in Litchville, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
She wrote: "We used to live in California with all of its gangs, murders, 
drugs, etc. But now we live in North Dakota with its peaceful prairies, 
friendly people and a generally relaxed atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Sather took particular exception to an article in Newsweek called 
"America's Outback," which, she complained, made the Plains states look like "a 
vast expanse of desolate wasteland." 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Ms. Sather observed, North Dakota is "one of the safest places 
to live." She points out that only a few people have bars on their windows or 
expensive security systems. "It's not because we don't care about safety, but 
there is just no need for them." 
</P>
<P>
She said the authors also forgot to mention the best thing about North Dakota 
-- the people. "My 12 years in California taught me to worry about myself 
first, then think about other people -- if I had time. But here, everybody 
looks out for everybody else. People here care about what happens to everyone 
-- from the little boy next door to the 80-year-old brothers down the road who 
are still farming. 
</P>
<P>
"I, myself, do not plan on leaving the state. When I get married and have 
children, I want them to be raised here." 
</P>
<P>
I hope Ms. Sather's hopes for the future are fulfilled. I hope she can find 
some goal-oriented young man who is literate and not on drugs or in jail. I 
hope she has healthy children (though not more than two) and that they elect to 
stay in North Dakota and carry on its peaceful tradition. 
</P>
<P>
But there's the rub. How are you going to keep them down on the farm? Her kids, 
like most, will probably grow up watching six hours of television every day, 
will see hundreds of cop thrillers dramatizing the excitement on the streets of 
Los Angeles -- the drug busts, the hookers, the car chases, the rock clubs, the 
street life -- and will drop out of school and run away to L.A. to get in on 
the fun. Hey, isn't everybody in the movies? 
</P>
<P>
What kid with dreams of driving a Porsche or BMW will be content to plow the 
fields on a John Deere tractor? What kid trudging off to school in midwinter in 
long underwear and heavy woolen clothing with ear muffs wouldn't rather go 
around in cutoff jeans and a T-shirt? What kid eating three hearty meals a day 
wouldn't prefer to subsist on junk food? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the big city is a magnet. Its attractions, no matter how sleazy 
or sinister, are always more powerful than the moral and healthful pull of 
rural life. The country has become urbanized, and the cities are deteriorating 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Spicer himself, like so many whose roots are in the heartland, still has 
an affection for it. Litchville, he says, is a hamlet of about 500 persons, 35 
miles southwest of Valley City, where he grew up. Ms. Sather's letter was sent 
to him by a boyhood chum who lives in Valley City. 
</P>
<P>
Spicer recalls that his father, a doctor, practiced in Litchville before moving 
to Valley City. He had finished Rush Medical College, in Chicago, in 1903, and 
a brother who practiced law in a nearby town persuaded him to settle in 
Litchville. 
</P>
<P>
"When he got off the Litchville-Dazey-Marion short line, there were three 
patients waiting for him on the depot platform. After tending to them, he 
visited an outhouse and found a $10 bill on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
"This really is the land of opportunity," he wrote his mother, who was then 
visiting her mother in Santa Ana. His mother had tried to get him to come west 
and locate in Santa Ana, but he wrote her: 
</P>
<P>
"Eva, everyone can't live in California." 
</P>
<P>
But, as Spicer says, "They're sure trying."

ON THE RECORD: BACH FOR THE 1990S, FROM THE 1950S ON EMI/ANGEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what amounts to an act of daring these days, EMI/Angel has released a 
recording of Bach played on modern instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Hendricks, whose pronounced vibrato wouldn't be at all acceptable in an 
antiquarian performance, is the featured soloist, applying her agile, 
exquisitely tuned soprano to two of the composer's most famous solo cantatas, 
"Jauchzet Gott," BWV 51, and the "Wedding" Cantata, BWV 202, as well as to 
Bach's own reworking for soprano of "Ich habe Genug," BWV 82, originally for 
bass (EMI/Angel 49843). 
</P>
<P>
The overall sound of the C.P.E. Bach Chamber Orchestra of Berlin may be on the 
lush side and Peter Schreier's conducting occasionally tends toward the 
heart-on-sleeve. But he keeps things moving for the most part and his 
instrumental soloists perform with admirable stylistic awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Although listeners may desire a keener rhythmic attack and more of the 
jubilation inherent in both "Jauchzet Gott" and "Weichet nur," it is difficult 
to imagine more accurate and sweet-toned singing than Hendricks offers here, 
and she does surprisingly well in suggesting the protagonist's world-weariness 
in "Ich habe Genug." 
</P>
<P>
EMI/Angel offers strong, simultaneous competition in a "Jauchzet Gott" 
appearing as part of a collection of recordings originally made by Elisabeth 
Schwarzkopf between 1947 and 1955 (63201, mid-price). The soprano launches into 
Bach with an intensity more akin to that of avenging angel than celebrant, but 
there is immense spirit and point to her singing, and to Peter Gellhorn's 
conducting of a crack ensemble from the Philharmonia Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The two sopranos offer one additional Bach work in common: the familiar "Sheep 
May Safely Graze" aria from the secular cantata, BWV 209. Here, Hendricks' 
guilelessness, her delightful embellishments and 
</P>
<P>
one of the most ethereal trills extant win out handily over Schwarzkopf's 
artfulness. 
</P>
<P>
The latter's program further includes her famous, incomparably vivacious 
interpretation of Mozart's "Exsultate, jubilate," and arias by Handel and 
Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
Bach's B-minor Mass as recorded under Herbert von Karajan's direction in 1952 
is in contrast a sluggish, densely textured abomination -- even by the 
standards of its time; a surpassingly well-sung and well-played abomination, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
The vocal quartet, comprising Schwarzkopf, Marga Hoffgen, Nicolai Gedda and 
Heinz Rehfuss, has seldom been surpassed on recordings, while the instrumental 
soloists, again from the Philharmonia Orchestra, and the chorus of the Vienna 
Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde manage to make their positive presences felt in 
spite of the conductorial odds against them (EMI/Angel 63505, two midpriced 
CDs). 
</P>
<P>
A particularly rewarding recent period Bach recording finds Philippe Herreweghe 
directing the splendid Franco-Belgian forces of La Chappelle Royal and the 
Collegium Vocale in one of the darkest and grandest of the sacred cantatas, 
"Ich hatte viel Bekummernis," BWV 21, and the instrumentally brilliant "Am 
Abend aber desselbigen Sabbats," BWV 42 (Harmonia Mundi 90328). 
</P>
<P>
Herreweghe leads with an affecting combination of dignity and rhythmic energy, 
with soprano Barbara Schlick and tenor Howard Crook outstanding among the vocal 
soloists. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there any shortage of energy or skill in the Bach program by London's 
Taverner Players under the direction of Andrew Parrott: the "Magnificat"; the 
so-called "Ascension" Oratorio, BWV 11, and the brief choral cantata, "Nun ist 
das Heil," BWV 50 (EMI/Angel 49959). 
</P>
<P>
The instrumentalists, including trumpeter Crispian Steele-Perkins and oboist 
Paul Goodwin, are among the period-performance elite, while the vocal 
contingent boasts such paragons as Emma Kirkby and Emily van Evera. 
</P>
<P>
But there are irritants too: the excessively clipped phrases and the unvarying 
flat-white quality of the solo voices, elements that belong to an earlier, more 
puritanical phase of the antiquarian movement. 
</P>
<P>
What may prove the ultimate sticking point here is the absence of a chorus, 
i.e., the soloists -- ranging en masse from five to eight -- fulfill that 
function as well, in accordance with some controversial recent scholarship. It 
works in the fast, contrapuntal numbers, particularly in BWV 11. 
</P>
<P>
But when the text calls for thunder and we receive instead neatly traced little 
vocal patterns, we can only wonder whether Bach really wanted such small forces 
or whether, as some of his correspondence suggests, he chafed at the necessity 
of having to make do with them. Bach's employers were, it should be remembered, 
anything but generous.

*** 1/2 ED BICKERT &amp; LORNE LOFSKY "THIS IS NEW" CONCORD JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two prominent Toronto guitarists -- Bickert, 57, and Lofsky, 36 -- join with 
two of Canada's best rhythm purveyors, bassist Neal Swainson and drummer Jerry 
Fuller, for a low-key collaboration on tunes mainly written by fellow jazzmen 
(Wes Montgomery, Cedar Walton, Horace Silver, Steve Swallow). Each has a solo 
track; Lofsky's harmonic grace is well displayed in the Ellington-Strayhorn 
"Star Crossed Lovers." Both men deal ingeniously with Charlie Parker's 
contrapuntal theme "Ah Leu Cha." A superior sampling of north-of-the-border 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
*** CLEVELAND WATKISS "Green Chimneys" Verve 
</P>
<P>
 Is Watkiss Britain's answer to Bobby McFerrin? The evidence is mixed. His 
self-overdubbed ensembles come off well; as a group he's impressive, but as a 
scat soloist he is derivative, as are some of his quasi-Hendricks lyrics. He is 
backed by some of England's best young (and mainly black) jazzmen; Courtney 
Pine and Steve Williamson play saxes on three tunes. The various rhythm 
sections try their best to swing, succeeding at times. Watkiss has potential; 
give him a chance -- this is his first outing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
*** JACK TEAGARDEN "That's a Serious Thing" RCA Bluebird 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt about it, Teagarden (1905-64) was the definitive trombone of his day 
and a splendid, Texas-twanged singer. Sadly, he was hampered too often by inept 
colleagues (the abysmal saxophonist Mezz Mezzrow), stupid songs ("I'se a 
Muggin' ") and pompous pseudo-jazz or dance bands (Paul Whiteman, Roger Wolfe 
Kahn). Of the 21 cuts, only the last eight -- made between 1938 and 1947 -- do 
him justice without unhappy trappings: an all-star date, a session of his own, 
and two tracks with Louis Armstrong, followed by a fine Bud Freeman clambake. 
But even some of the weakest items have valuable moments by Joe Venuti, Fats 
Waller, Benny Goodman et al. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 MARLON JORDON "For You Only" Columbia 
</P>
<P>
Branford Marsalis helps to shore up the debut of a very young trumpeter in an 
egregious example of oversell and overkill. To credit this youth with "a 
heart-racing hymn to the fearless warriors of this Native American music" (just 
for playing "Cherokee" in eighth notes) and with "a swirling vortex of 
idealism, passion, and hard swing" is embarrassing. (Did a relative write these 
notes?) Sure, he's very promising indeed, and he is in high-powered company; 
but the first four minutes of "Stardust," in which he plods through the verse 
and chorus dead straight, are boredom incarnate. Still, Jordon has plenty of 
time to mature -- he's only 18. LEONARD FEATHER

ON THAT SUBJECT: One guy you won't see lining up for Eagles tickets is pop 
satirist Mojo Nixon, whose new album, "Otis," contains a raffish blast at his 
least favorite ex-Eagle. Titled "Don Henley Must Die," it mocks the performer 
with the same scabrous glee that Johnny Rotten once directed at Pink Floyd. It 
goes in part: 
</P>
<P>
 Turned on the TV and what did I see, 
</P>
<P>
 This bloated, hairy thing winning a Grammy, 
</P>
<P>
 Best rock vocalist, compared to what, 
</P>
<P>
 A bunch of pseudo-craft, Instamatic satanic fluff . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He's a poet of despair, pumped up with hot air, 
</P>
<P>
 He's serious, pretentious and I just don't care, 
</P>
<P>
 Don Henley must die, don't let him get back together with Glenn Frey. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he picked on Henley (as opposed to say, Sting), Nixon explained: 
"Because Don's the ringleader of this pompous-twit, brain-dulling anti-rock 
Muzak of the '90s. The way I look at it -- you cut off the head and the beast 
will die. Don and I agree on a lot of political things, but if you played his 
songs for some guy in Africa, he'd say, 'Why is this white guy whining so 
much?' Rock 'n' roll has simply left him. He's as far removed from Little 
Richard as you can be." 
</P>
<P>
The notoriously thin-skinned Henley, famous in media circles for writing heated 
letters about allegedly inaccurate stories, countered with a statement saying: 
"I've never heard the song in its entirety, but some of the lyrics were read to 
me over the phone. We then extended an invitation to Mr. Nixon via his manager 
to be the opening act on the remainder of my tour with our blessing to perform 
the song. He declined our offer. Personally, I think the boy just needs a good 
laxative." 
</P>
<P>
(Nixon says he "never received a formal offer" to tour with Henley and "is 
ready to go" if Henley contacts him.)

FAMILY TIES: Now that Wilson Phillips (which features the daughters of Brian 
Wilson and John and Michelle Phillips) has enjoyed a No. 1 single, who will be 
the next second-generation show-biz popsters to make a dent in the pop charts? 
Atco Records is betting on Tricia Leigh Fisher, a 21-year-old pop newcomer with 
impeccable Hollywood bloodlines. The daughter of Eddie Fisher and Connie 
Stevens, she has a new record due out at the end of the month, which features 
such house-style dance grooves as "My Heart Holds On," "So Deep So True" and 
"Trapped By Love." 
</P>
<P>
.. . Meanwhile, Arista is showcasing a young Texas singer named Kris McKay by 
putting her on L.A.'s espresso circuit. This Tuesday night she'll play (count 
'em) three gigs at three different coffee houses, starting at 8:30 at the 
Pikme-Up, then moving to Java and the Living Room later in the evening.

MOTEL 6 CALIFORNIA: Are the Eagles planning a 1991 reunion, despite all those 
loud denials we heard earlier this year? It's no secret that the core of the 
band (in other words, the members still speaking to each other -- Don Henley, 
Glenn Frey and Timothy Schmidt) have performed together twice in recent months, 
most recently at a surprise show at the recent Radio &amp; Records convention 
(where they left the stage with a "see you next year"-style farewell). Insiders 
say talk of a reunion tour has heated up in the past months. 
</P>
<P>
But why would Henley, who has been dubbed the "F. Scott Fitzgerald of pop" and 
established himself as a serious solo artist, jeopardize his hard-won career 
advances simply for the financial windfall of a cobwebby Eagles tour? 
</P>
<P>
Neither the band's former manager Irving Azoff, nor Henley or Frey, would 
comment. But industry insiders say Henley and Frey are planning an August 
attempt to write several new songs, which could make a long-awaited Eagles 
greatest-hits collection. Will a tour follow? It depends on several big 'ifs.' 
If all goes well with the Henley-Frey collaboration, the hits package could be 
out by spring or summer 1991, which be the perfect time for a big U.S. tour. If 
Henley and Frey patch up their differences with ex-Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh, 
he would be an important musical cog in the tour lineup. And if older Eagles 
fans are still willing to venture out to big concert halls, the tour could be a 
major summer attraction. As one observer put it: "Never underestimate the power 
of nostalgia. If people will go to a Doobie Brothers reunion, you'd have to 
think they'd kill to see the Eagles."

Manilow appeals mainly to the straight-laced, over-35 crowd that prefers 
ballads brimming with melodrama -- the chief ingredient in Manilow staples like 
"Mandy" and "I Write the Songs." 
</P>
<P>
That audience should love this swiftly-paced, well-produced, 90-minute tape of 
Manilow's Broadway show -- with the songs structured around key points in his 
life and career. Though mainly a solo show, Manilow uses supporting performers 
for several numbers. Never an exceptional singer, he makes maximum use of his 
strengths -- earnestness, an amiable personality and a knack for making his 
audience feel warm and comfortable. DENNIS HUNT

RECORD RACK: **** SONIC YOUTH "GOO" DGC: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE 
STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).

Sonic Youth is the Rolling Stones of noise music, a band imitated as often as 
Aerosmith and a source of strength to alienated college students all over the 
globe. A lot of smart people think it's the best band in the world. 
</P>
<P>
But as the avatar of '80s indie underground rock, finally making its 
major-label debut, Sonic Youth faces a conundrum: How does an aggressively 
confrontational band make (a) a commercial record without (b) selling out? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, of course, is to make the record an elaborate joke on the idea of 
making a commercial record, a hermetic, album-length parody that's the 
equivalent of putting those waggling-finger quotation marks around the whole 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
The songs revolve around catchy, nonsensical choruses -- things like "My friend 
Goo / Just says, 'P.U.' " or "I don't wanna / I don't think so" -- that stick 
with you as insistently as anything ABBA ever came up with. Great swaths of 
dissonant guitar noise move the way radio hooks are supposed to, and they 
become radio hooks themselves. There's always a beat to grab on to, sometimes 
tribal, sometimes poppy, but always danceable, and "Goo" rocks as hard as 
Mudhoney, while working on about half a dozen more levels. Call "Goo" the 
"Exile on Main Street" of the snide generation. JONATHAN GOLD

This is one woman's view of trying to get by in an all-too-loveless world, and 
in the choice selection of material from a variety of writers, this Kentucky 
wonder exudes a steely resolve that never gives in to self-pity. Instead, she 
relies on a great sense of humor and an unflagging faith that things will get 
better, even when disappointment strikes. As a singer, she may not plumb the 
depths of the human soul as Emmylou Harris can, but she compensates with miles 
and miles of heart. RANDY LEWIS

Sweat's debut album "Make It Last Forever" caught fire largely because of 
producer Teddy Riley, and his absence is strongly felt on this Sweat-produced 
follow-up. 
</P>
<P>
While he has a few good, funk-flavored ideas, his album is far from overflowing 
with them. Sweat is strongest on "Just One of Them Thangs," a smoky jam that 
teams him with Gerald Levert, a gutsy singer who nearly always endows a tune 
with hot and sweaty intentions. Sweat stumbles on "Merry Go Round" and "I Knew 
That You Were Cheatin'," where he works his plaintive, "please, baby, please" 
approach way too hard. CONNIE JOHNSON

FOR SOME READERS, TIFFANY IS NO JETSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An item in the July 8 Outtakes column begins, "One person who won't be buying a 
ticket to 'Jetsons: The Movie': actress Janet Waldo." Make it three: Janet 
Waldo, my sister and I. 
</P>
<P>
I was pretty excited when I heard that the Jetsons were coming out in an 
animated feature. 
</P>
<P>
I grew up with that cartoon. Then I read many articles concerning this Judy 
Jetson incident, one being Kyle Counts' Outtakes item, "Not a Genuine Tiffany." 
</P>
<P>
From just listening to Judy Jetson's voice in the movie previews, I could not 
connect with the Jetsons. It just wasn't the same Jetsons I grew up with. Judy 
Jetson was not the real Judy Jetson without Janet Waldo's voice. The Judy I 
heard was an imposter. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure many people feel the same way. How could Hanna-Barbera (the producers) 
do such a thing?! It boils down to greed. Why couldn't Tiffany just be happy 
with recording the soundtrack? Did she have to steal Waldo's role as well?

A BREATHLESS SEARCH FOR THE MOST EVIL VILLAIN IN 'DICK TRACY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The most evil, cunning, two-timing, ruthless murderer that Tracy came up 
against was Breathless Mahoney, chillingly portrayed by Madonna. I shudder to 
imagine an impressionable child meeting up with someone who resembles that 
villain. I hope America's youth can contain their horror and treat that 
disfigured person with respect.

Regarding the June 24 letters about "Dick Tracy": I saw it with my boys and 
then took my husband. 
</P>
<P>
We loved it! 
</P>
<P>
Why can't people just go to a theater, sit back, eat popcorn and and enjoy the 
movie? Why is it some people think "Oh my God, kids are going to see deformed 
people and run screaming from them, thinking they are bad guys" because they 
saw Pruneface in "Dick Tracy"? 
</P>
<P>
Do these people have kids? Do they think kids are stupid? 
</P>
<P>
And concerning the letter writer who points out there are no African-Americans 
in movies that certain directors make: Come on, don't take it so seriously. 
It's only movies.

FIGHTING STEREOTYPES

While reading the July 8 letters critical of rap music, I recall the 1950s when 
our parish priest condemned "that truck driver Presley" whose hip swinging was 
called "too vile for teen-agers to view." Jerry Lee Lewis was also castigated 
for "acting like a rabid animal on stage." 
</P>
<P>
A local radio station owner and Republican political leader barred Bo Diddley's 
music from his broadcasts because he had deduced Bo's lyrics were 
"unintelligible and thus must be obscene." Ironically, Bo Diddley is now a 
staunch Republican who performed at George Bush's inaugural gala. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe in another 30 years today's rappers will become staunch Republicans and 
we'll look back and laugh at the flap being made over rappers by those 
totalitarian fundamentalists who know what's best for us to hear now, as they 
did in the 1950s.

THE PERFORMERS WANT TO PIERCE THE CONSCIENCE OF THE AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

Things start out innocently enough for Brenda Varda's character in Timberlake 
Wertenbaker's "The Love of the Nightingale" (L.A. Theatre Works at the Edgemar 
Complex in Santa Monica). But then her brother-in-law takes a brooding fancy to 
her during a long ship's voyage. 
</P>
<P>
His lying that he's suddenly single does little to arouse her ardor. Nor does 
his murdering her beloved. When all else fails, he rapes her. Later, when she 
confronts him with her desperation and fury, he cuts out her tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"The more distance she has to go from innocence, the more horrible that moment 
is," said Varda, who is stunning as Philomele, from a giddy, fresh-faced 
teen-ager to a middle-aged madwoman. The moment after the attack -- when 
Philomele is reeling in agony and disbelief, choking on her blood -- "gets very 
silent in the audience," she said. "But the way we do it isn't nearly as 
violent as it'd be if you really had your tongue cut out. The amount of blood 
would be insane. And you can't swallow; you can't breathe." 
</P>
<P>
The story (set in ancient Greece and freely adapted from ancient myth) is 
indeed less concerned with graphic bloodletting than with larger issues of 
chauvinism, censorship, sisterhood, slavery, rape and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be disturbing," the actress said of the violence upon her character, 
"because that kind of thing is not something that doesn't happen today. There 
are death squads in innumerable countries that eliminate people or make them 
silent or cut off their hands. So what we're doing here is not divorced from 
the real world. It also has a lot of resonances with what's happening now with 
the National Endowment for the Arts, our artistic voices being silenced." 
</P>
<P>
Director Peter Mark Schifter recalls that upon reading the play, his immediate 
response was: "Intelligence! Ideas! Theatrical power! Not commercial!" 
</P>
<P>
"I did it because it's an important play," he said. "It has important things to 
say for contemporary society. And Brenda brings a real ingenuousness to her 
part -- and a piercing intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
Varda believes that intelligence applies to the piece as well, taking exception 
to some of the criticism, which labeled "Nightingale" heavy-handed and 
didactic. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the force of words and images that shock you and scream at you, that 
say 'Are you listening?' are necessary," she said. "This is no museum piece. 
Most women have been subjected to some sort of harassment. If you live in New 
York, chances are you've been mugged. I lived in Chicago; I got mugged, my 
apartment was broken into, my car was stolen. Now those aren't necessarily 
crimes against women," she added, laughing, "but since I'm a woman and the 
crimes were against me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The ability to slip-slide from serious to silly is one of the actress's most 
charming qualities. Lissome and long-limbed, she swears to having been an A-1 
nerd growing up ("thick glasses and frizzy hair"). She entered the University 
of Minnesota as an engineering major but switched to acting after playing piano 
for the theater classes, figuring, "Hey, I can do that." She also studied 
journalism and interned in television news and on a morning radio show. 
</P>
<P>
"I have stopped acting many times," said Varda, who returned to the university 
for her master's in communications ("doing research on creativity, how to 
stimulate people to be more creative"), but left before graduating. 
Distractions included tours with the St. Louis Repertory and Chicago's Second 
City, managing an art gallery, serving as creative consultant for a 
prank-playing company in Palo Alto, and -- when times were lean -- paying dues 
in waitressing and the secretarial pool. 
</P>
<P>
"The activities seem sort of disparate," she said. "But I like to think of it 
as a continuum; things always end up feeding each other. Some of what I've done 
on the business side has been totally invaluable in creating an acting life in 
Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Not having a regular job, she says, is liberating: "I like to do different 
things. I write, I play piano, I sing, I've written a couple of musicals. It 
doesn't do wonders for your pension, but as far as what I get to feed myself 
with, it's worth it."

Two months ago a producer-type sat me down and told me that what my movie (a 
musical) needed, in order to sell big, was Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
He said I should dump the actress I had and think "soundtrack album deal" 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of individual is not concerned with entertaining and enlightening an 
audience with a good movie but whether the neon-colored marketing campaign is 
in place before anyone has written a script! 
</P>
<P>
As one entertainment attorney droned on to me during a recent meeting, "All 
they want is Tom Cruise in a race car." If this is becoming the norm, then this 
business is headed for serious trouble.

MAKO SUSHI'S PERFECT PRESENTATION NOURISHES DINER WITH 'HAPPY MOMENTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For weeks or even months on end I can forget the greatest virtue of good food 
-- that it can make me happy. No doubt my memory fails because most of the food 
I eat isn't all that great. I only recall how happy a meal can make me when 
suddenly I look up from my plate and feel well-taken-care-of, nourished, safe 
and delighted. 
</P>
<P>
Two such moments occurred recently, and both took place at Mako Sushi in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Mako Sushi has only been open about six months. It's another one of those 
mini-mall restaurants that turns out to be far more tasteful and charming than 
it looks from the parking lot. Inside it's spare, with a lot of pale wood, some 
judiciously placed red lacquer, a glassed-in kitchen area, and a small sushi 
bar where Mako and his son prepare some of the best sushi available. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I experienced happiness there, I was sitting at the sushi bar 
with my friend John. We were chatting intermittently with the man on John's 
left, who was a great fan of the head sushi chef, Mako. "He used to be at 
Gennmai sushi," the man said, "and before that, he was at what is now 
Matsuhisa's on La Cienega." Then he suggested we try the bonita, two mild, 
dense parallelograms of a tuna-type fish topped with smelt roe and ginger. 
Also, he urged us to try the salmon, which is cured on the premises and is very 
subtle and refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
We also tried tuna that was a deep, translucent red, and melt-in-the mouth 
barracuda. Then we ate a brown rice tempura vegetable roll. This is a 
particularly large roll because it contains actual tempura vegetables -- fried 
yam and bean and broccoli -- wrapped in seaweed and rice. We found that the 
brown rice was indeed different from the white rice in that it's rounder, less 
sticky and slightly more nutty in flavor. We were just finishing that roll when 
an irregularly shaped, sputtering piece of fish appeared before us. John had 
ordered it. "It's kama," he said. "Yellowtail collar. You just dig at it with 
chopsticks." 
</P>
<P>
I dug. And every bite was a revelation. I never knew that the neck of a 
yellowtail could provide such a wide range of flavors and textures. Some of the 
meat was fluffy, some dark and oily, all of it very rich and delicious. 
</P>
<P>
It was my first moment of happiness at Mako. 
</P>
<P>
And, at the risk of sounding a bit crass, my sense of well-being wasn't 
diminished when the bill came. After having eaten as much sushi as we could, 
our bill was exactly $30, including tea. 
</P>
<P>
The next time happiness hit at Mako Sushi, I was again at the sushi bar, this 
time with two good girlfriends. Japanese pop songs played on the sound system. 
Mako was speaking Spanish to one of his customers and slicing up gorgeous sushi 
and sashimi. We had salmon sashimi that was wrapped in cucumber, an excellent 
scallop hand roll, and a jazz roll (yellowtail and salmon). When the special 
vegetable roll was delivered, we had to just sit and stare. 
</P>
<P>
The cross-sections were like tiny, perfectly composed abstract paintings, or 
like laser photographs of some microscopic, perfect world. We pored over it, 
heads bumping. "It's just too beautiful to eat," said Annie. And then suddenly, 
we were all smiling and laughing, just from being nourished and pampered and 
having been given something beautiful to look at. 
</P>
<P>
On another visit to Mako Sushi, I made myself sit away from the sushi bar and 
try some entrees and noodles. Though I wouldn't go so far as to describe eating 
at a table in Mako Sushi as a disappointment, it definitely did not yield the 
same pleasures that the sushi bar did. 
</P>
<P>
At the table, the service was attentive and yet sporadic: Our waters were 
eagerly replenished, but food came out of the kitchen in no particular order. 
My friend Pablo finished off a good miso soup, an ordinary dinner salad, and an 
excellent teriyaki New York steak a good 15 minutes before the arrival of his 
father's chiri dofu, a soup of fish, noodles and tofu.

As late as the soup was, it was exceptional -- light and clear and nobly 
simple. Meanwhile, I worked my way through an array of appetizers: a limp 
soft-shell crab; some acceptable, if slightly soggy, grilled eggplant; and an 
assortment of dazzling, delicious sushi.

Pablo had finished so far ahead of us, he became fidgety, so we kept ordering 
him bowls of green tea ice cream to keep him occupied. And when he didn't want 
any more ice cream, he wrote a poem: 
</P>
<P>
 The most I love 
</P>
<P>
Is the dessert 
</P>
<P>
 Named green tea 
</P>
<P>
 It tastes like cold tea

TINTING, AS SOME of us may remember, was the process by which color was added 
to black-and-white photos before Eastman Kodak came up with Kodachrome film in 
1935. "Tinting is a dying art, but it's beginning to take hold again," says 
Marita Penner, who has been bringing new life to black-and-white photos. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's just the T-shirt or perhaps the tennis shoes in a photograph, 
Penner manages to put her paintbrush on the particular details that will make 
or break a photo. She shoots in old-fashioned black and white -- which, she 
explains, won't fade the way color photographs eventually will -- and then 
hand-tints a few highlights with photo oils. The result is a smashing art photo 
in old-fashioned color. 
</P>
<P>
Penner's exhibit at arts-and-crafts fairs is a popular one, and a number of her 
shots are longtime big sellers. (Her gallery-mounted, 11x14-inch photos in 
16x20-inch frames sell for $75 each.) 
</P>
<P>
Penner also makes house calls; she will go to clients' homes to shoot 
children's portraits. For a $34 fee, plus traveling expenses, she provides one 
8x10 photo, two 5x7s, three 3x5s and 12 wallet-size snapshots (all but the 
wallet pictures bear her trademark tints).

INSERTS CONCERNING NIXON TERMED UNFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the article that Beverly Beyette wrote, "After Smoke Cleared" (July 
3). 
</P>
<P>
In the first paragraph, Beyette establishes the date of the devastating 
Brentwood fire as Nov. 6, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Yet she makes two more references to the time period in her description of the 
fire that threatened Richard Nixon's home, stating "Richard Nixon, defeated in 
the presidential race the year before by John F. Kennedy" . . . and, in the 
same paragraph, "before fleeing with treasured possessions that included notes 
on the forthcoming gubernatorial campaign (which he was to lose to Edmund G. 
(Pat) Brown)." Just what do these political inserts have to do with Nixon's 
treasured possessions? Does recalling two of Nixon's lost campaigns have 
anything to do with the news of the inferno? 
</P>
<P>
In the interest of good and fair reporting, my husband and I take exception to 
these inserts.

ERMA BOMBECK: INFINITELY MORE ZEROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is anyone else suffering from zero overload? Every time I open the newspaper or 
turn on the television, it's a billion dollars here or a trillion there. I 
never understood all those zeros when Carl Sagan talked about them, but it 
didn't seem important then. Now that I have to pay a share of $500 billion to 
bail out the savings and loans, it's important. I've never owed on anything 
that had 11 zeros before. 
</P>
<P>
I can't get a handle on that much money. If $500 billion was broken down into 
$5 bills, would they reach around the world? If you stacked them and sat on 
them, would you get a nosebleed from the altitude? How many sheets could Imelda 
Marcos buy with them? If they were nose tissues, how long would they last 50 
people with colds? 
</P>
<P>
The practice of zero dropping has gotten out of hand. No one even blinks 
anymore when talking about a national debt of $10.4 trillion, Adnan Khashoggi's 
apartment a steal at $33 million, or the California lottery being upped to 
$15.6 million to get people interested in it again. It's as if people have been 
numbed with Novocain. All those zeros mean nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The other night a television reader reported that Ivan Boesky took a tax 
writeoff on half of his $100-million settlement on insider trading. She gave it 
all the excitement of a kid swiping a tip at Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe our apathy started when plastic replaced money. We don't see money 
anymore; therefore, we place no value on it. We have forgotten what it looks 
like, how long it takes to get it, and how hard we have to work for it. 
</P>
<P>
On the news the other night there was talk about changing some of the 
denominations of money when someone observed, "Why don't we do away with the 
dollar bill? It's useless, and besides, it doesn't buy anything anymore." 
</P>
<P>
I hate to think I will eventually fall into the state of numbness where I will 
no longer question what all those zeros mean. If we are to be assaulted with 
numbers, why can't they be related to something? 
</P>
<P>
When a person is convicted of ripping off the government in nine zeros, tell me 
how many organ or bone marrow transplants that will buy. If a scam is involved, 
tell me how much money that would mean to cancer and AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
If they're going to throw all those zeros at us, tell us how many hungry 
children it would feed or how many homeless it would house. Maybe we could get 
a little rage going here.

ROGER SIMON: WHEN YOU KNOW A GUY WHO KNOWS A GUY . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court says that patronage is wrong. In a recent ruling, the 
justices said that virtually all public employees must be free of the spoils 
system. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure the justices know what they are doing. I'm sure they know all about 
fairness. 
</P>
<P>
I'm just not sure they know about patronage. I'm not sure they have ever tried 
to pick up garbage on the end of a stick. 
</P>
<P>
I have. For one summer between my freshman and sophomore years in college, I 
used a three-foot stick with a nail on the end to pick up garbage from a beach 
and place it in a canvas bag I wore slung around my neck. 
</P>
<P>
It was a patronage job. I got it through sheer clout. I knew a guy who knew a 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
I knew a community activist who knew the city treasurer of Chicago. The 
treasurer, Marshall Korshak, dispensed jobs like some people dispense breath 
mints. 
</P>
<P>
The community activist wrote me a letter and I took the letter downtown to 
Korshak's rather grand office. He saw me immediately. People who are really 
secure in their power never keep other people waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"So you wanna pick up garbage?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yessir," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"You in college?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yessir," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, then," he said. "You're qualified." 
</P>
<P>
He was a humorous guy in his own way. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote me a letter on his official stationery, put it in an envelope and told 
me to go to park district headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
When I got there, more than a hundred kids were in a line that snaked down the 
hall. They were all there for jobs. I got in the end of the line and waited. 
</P>
<P>
After about 20 minutes, a passing clerk saw in my hand Korshak's letter with 
the city seal on the envelope. 
</P>
<P>
He took me by the sleeve and led me to the head of the line and then into an 
office. "Why dincha say something?" he said, sitting down and writing out my 
job assignment. "You had a letter. You don't have to wait if you have a 
letter." 
</P>
<P>
And so that day I learned about power and politics and patronage: 
</P>
<P>
Only mugs waited in line. Only mugs thought things were on the level. Guys who 
knew things knew differently. Guys who knew things knew you didn't bother going 
someplace and waiting in line. They knew you needed a letter. 
</P>
<P>
I spent the summer picking up garbage. It would be a terrible cliche to say it 
was one of the best summers of my life, but it was one of the best summers of 
my life. 
</P>
<P>
It was outdoor work and, by some strange reversal, there was great status 
walking around in work gloves and wearing a garbage sack past friends who were 
lolling around in bathing suits. 
</P>
<P>
You were earning money. And you were obviously a guy who knew things. 
</P>
<P>
People imagine there is always something heavy-handed and forbidding about 
patronage. That some guy knocks on your door 10 years later and asks you to do 
a favor for the Godfather. 
</P>
<P>
And, at some levels, that exists. To get a favor, you have to do a favor. 
</P>
<P>
But at my level, at the level of patronage the Supreme Court says cannot now 
exist, favors were not asked in return. I was just small fry. I wasn't making 
enough to be able to buy a ticket to a political dinner. So what's the worst 
anyone could have asked of me? To vote Democratic? Hell, I was living on the 
South Side of Chicago. I wasn't sure voting Republican was even legal. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the summer, I went back to college and developed a social 
conscience. This is one of the drawbacks of higher education. Eventually I 
graduated and eventually I became a newspaper columnist and eventually I wrote 
columns railing about the evils and unfairness of patronage. 
</P>
<P>
And one day, I went to see Marshall Korshak, who by that time was retired, to 
talk to him about all those jobs he had handed out. 
</P>
<P>
He was proud of his accomplishments. "Over the years, I placed thousands of 
people," he said. "Thousands." 
</P>
<P>
He did not remember, of course, that I was one of the people he had placed. So 
I told him about it. And, ungrateful cur that I was, I unloaded my guilty 
conscience on him. I told him that what he had done for me was not fair, not 
right. Everyone should have an equal chance for every job, I said, regardless 
of whom they know. 
</P>
<P>
Korshak gave me a weary smile. "Tell me something," he said. "You did the job? 
You picked up the garbage?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," I said. "I did the job. I did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
"So what wasn't fair?" he said. "As long as the job got done, what wasn't 
fair?" 
</P>
<P>
The summer after my job on the beach, I had determined that I would go 
straight. No more patronage for me. So I took a civil service test and got a 
job delivering the U.S. mail. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to report that the civil service system worked better than the 
patronage system. But I think you all know how well the mail system operates, 
then and now. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of the work in the post office, where people got their jobs through 
tests, was no better than on the beach, where they got them through clout. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, patronage is wrong. The Supreme Court says so. 
</P>
<P>
And I am trying to imagine, how, under the new guidelines, we will have to 
select kids for summer beach jobs. 
</P>
<P>
There will have to be a committee of experts to design a test, of course. And 
this test will have to be free of all cultural, racial and religious bias. 
</P>
<P>
Then there will have to be people to conduct the tests and grade the tests and 
review the appeals of the people who flunk the test. 
</P>
<P>
So I am guessing we will need about 50 government bureaucrats to do what one 
clerk did by reading my letter. 
</P>
<P>
I guess that's what the Supreme Court had in mind. And I'm sure it is all worth 
it. 
</P>
<P>
I just hope the garbage gets picked up.

OPPOSITE POLES: READERS RAISE MORE BURNING ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congressman (Robert) Dornan views our nation's flag as "the ultimate expression 
of the Judeo-Christian ethic." Obviously, Dornan does not really understand the 
religions to which he appeals for support in his attempt to prohibit flag 
burning. 
</P>
<P>
While some Christian churches revere icons or relics, all aspects of Judaism 
and most Christian churches oppose the glorification of material objects, 
including flags. Instead of respect for material objects, Judeo-Christian 
ethics teach respect for ideals and principles, such as the liberties found in 
our nation's Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the opposition to the constitutional amendment that would have banned 
flag burning had nothing to do with civil liberties. Instead, religious 
opposition feared an attempt to deify the flag. After all, how can you 
desecrate something unless it is first declared sacred?

TENANTS OF 2 RUN-DOWN BUILDINGS ON GOLDEN AVENUE WITHHOLD RENT IN PROTEST OVER 
LIVING CONDITIONS

Maggie Adame woke up one recent morning and found a cockroach in her ear. Her 
8-month-old boy has a roach bite on the cheek. And the people across the way in 
apartment No. 4 complain that mice crawl out of the furnace in what serves as 
both living room and bedroom for two adults and a 4-month-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of 526 and 582 Golden Ave. live in twin beige stucco buildings 
with peeling paint, holes in the walls, cockroaches that seem to breed in the 
woodwork and, they say, an assortment of rats, mice, ants, fleas, mold, broken 
smoke alarms and exposed electrical wires. 
</P>
<P>
They are like thousands of other welfare mothers, immigrants and laborers who 
live in the city's stock of decayed and neglected apartments. What makes the 
people along Golden Avenue different is that they have declared war. 
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 18 of the 20 tenants went on strike, vowing to with hold rents that 
range from $390 to $450 a month until their landlord, Henry Horst, makes the 
buildings livable. 
</P>
<P>
Horst, a retired chemical company worker who lives in Rialto, said he keeps his 
buildings in the best shape he can, considering the rent he charges. He said 
his tenants are poor housekeepers who cram too many people into apartments that 
measure 130 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to account for the roaches that swarmed across the stove and kitchen 
cupboards in No. 6, where Francisco Cruz and his wife have lived for just one 
month, Horst said the building is just old. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of old buildings have roaches," he said. "This building has always had 
roaches, ever since I owned it. I make sure my apartments are in good shape 
before people move in. A lot of the people here are not very good 
housekeepers." 
</P>
<P>
On a hot evening last week, the cement walkway that divides the two buildings 
was redolent with the smells of dinner cooking. Many of the places are small 
but neat, with plastic flower arrangements, lace curtains and doilies. 
</P>
<P>
Inside No. 4, Elvira Vidales had just finished frying meat and potatoes with 
her kitchen cupboards open. That way, she said, the roaches hide from the light 
instead of falling into the food. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalo Alvarado, who shares the apartment with Vidales and their 4-month-old 
daughter, Alma, says: "I want the apartment to be fixed -- the holes, the 
paint. The locks are no good, the smoke alarms don't work. We wake up in the 
night and find roaches on the baby." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado earns $600 a month delivering ice. Nearly $400 of that goes to rent. 
That means they live in poverty, but it shouldn't mean they live in filth, said 
Kate McClatchy of the Long Beach Housing Action Assn., a grass-roots group that 
advocates tenants' rights and low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys from the Legal Aid Foundation of Long Beach have agreed to represent 
Golden Avenue tenants should Horst take them to court. As of last week, Horst 
had filed lawsuits against four tenants, and 13 more are anticipated, said the 
foundation's executive director, Toby Rothschild. 
</P>
<P>
If no settlement is reached, a judge will review the living conditions and 
decide what rent the tenants should pay, Rothschild said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tenants have reported Horst to the Long Beach Department of 
Health and Human Services, which sent a letter requesting that the repairs be 
made. If they are not, a health inspector will be sent to the scene and, in 
extreme cases, prosecution for health and safety violations can result, 
environmental health officer Donald Cillay said. 
</P>
<P>
McClatchy said the rent strike is the first of many tenant-rights actions 
planned along Golden Avenue, a street filled with children and run-down 
apartments that backs up against the Long Beach Freeway near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The blocks of Golden from 4th to 7th streets are scheduled for redevelopment, 
offering landlords potentially big profits and little incentive to maintain 
buildings that might one day be leveled, McClatchy said. 
</P>
<P>
A park is tentatively scheduled to be built on the land across the street from 
striking tenants. Such an improvement could substantially increase the value of 
the property on which the buildings sit and make the buildings themselves 
almost worthless, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"That park," McClatchy said, "is going to be real nice for the white yuppies 
who move into the downtown area. It won't necessarily be available to the 
people who have populated this area for so many years. We are not against more 
green space, but it doesn't have to be done at the expense of poor people."

VOTER ALLIANCE STRIVING TO BE POLITICAL VOICE FOR FILIPINOS;

ELECTIONS: THE GROUP'S GOALS INCLUDE REGISTERING MORE FILIPINO VOTERS, CREATING 
A NEW CULTURAL CENTER AND GROOMING CANDIDATES.

<P>
During the last city election, local Filipinos got a taste of U.S. politics. 
They called at their compatriots' homes, knocked on their doors and handed them 
flyers. 
</P>
<P>
The new activists urged their fellow citizens to reelect Mayor Ernie Kell, who 
barely won the election by 700 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a difference," said Paul Blanco, a leader in the local Filipino 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Blanco and other Filipinos want to continue making a difference in Long Beach 
politics, where minority representation is practically nonexistent. They 
recently formed a nonpartisan political group and set goals including 
registering more Filipino voters, creating a new cultural center and eventually 
grooming their own candidates for political office. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the Filipinos have always been taken for granted. We want to have 
our voices heard," said Blanco, president of the Long Beach-based Federation of 
Filipino-American Assns. 
</P>
<P>
The new nonpartisan group, which falls under the federation's umbrella, is 
called the Filipino-American Voters Alliance. The group's officers were 
officially inducted earlier this month, but the alliance has been in the 
planning stages since last year and has nearly 1,300 members, according to its 
chairman, Hector L. Sulit. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first goal is to educate Filipinos to exercise their right to vote," Sulit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The group plans to raise the issue of voting at most Filipino social and 
service-oriented gatherings, which the federation sponsors almost weekly, Sulit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The federation, through its six affiliated groups, helps Filipinos apply for 
medical benefits, provides orientation for new immigrants and offers other 
referral and social services to the approximately 650,000 Filipinos living in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
But until now, there was no group to focus on politics and politicians. "There 
are so many of us, but we're not getting anywhere," said Sulit, who pointed out 
that about 26,000 Filipinos live in Long Beach. Federation officials estimate 
that about 4,000 of the Filipino residents in the city are registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, Filipinos have not been politically involved here," said Mary 
Bradley, federation treasurer. "Back home, if you do anything, if you become 
involved, people might think you're a communist." 
</P>
<P>
Federation member Sam D. Demonteverde added: "Many just don't realize that they 
can make a difference in the affairs of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Sulit said Filipino residents contacted during the June election "were all 
enthusiastic about it. They all said it was time for us to wake up." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Adler, Kell's political consultant, said Filipino voters "did play an 
important role in the election. The efforts by their group and others made a 
difference. In a close election, everybody deserves a share of the credit. I 
hope their involvement in the race whets their appetite for more." 
</P>
<P>
Sulit said Filipinos endorsed Kell because he was accessible and appeared 
receptive to their concerns for a new cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
They also chose to endorse the incumbent because there seemed to be few 
differences between him and his opponent, Councilman Tom Clark, Sulit said. 
</P>
<P>
Blanco and others said they are talking to several agencies that may partly pay 
for the cultural center project, which is in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Voters Alliance is rooted in Long Beach, officials said, they plan to 
work with other Filipino groups in communities with large Filipino populations, 
including Wilmington, Gardena and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling my people that we are not going anywhere unless we get our act 
together," Blanco said. "We can make a political impact on the community.

AT HOME: WHERE A FREE RIDE IS AMONG PERKS; 
</P>
<P>
CITY OF COMMERCE: WITH A HEAVY INDUSTRIAL TAX BASE, ITS RESIDENTS GET MANY FREE 
SERVICES THAT OTHER TOWNS CAN'T AFFORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, Dillow is a La Canada Flintridge-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of us probably wouldn't think that City of Commerce bears a striking 
resemblance to heaven. Rogelia Gomez would disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to where I used to live, this is heaven," Gomez said. "I just like 
everything about Commerce." 
</P>
<P>
Until a year ago, Gomez, 53, a part-time cook who came to Los Angeles from 
Mexico in 1973, lived in a rough neighborhood in East L.A., with all the 
unpleasant ramifications thereof -- crime, graffiti, an overall deteriorating 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
Then her son-in-law, a longtime resident of Commerce, steered her toward that 
city. Eventually, Gomez bought, for $200,000, two two-bedroom, one-bath homes 
on a single lot on Astor Avenue in the western section of the city. Now she 
lives in the rear house and her daughter and another son-in-law live in the 
front house with her two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The houses are small, like most of the homes in this predominantly Latino 
neighborhood. (Once mostly Anglo, Commerce is now 93% Hispanic.) And, like just 
about everyone else in Commerce, Gomez lives in close proximity to busy 
freeways, railroad tracks and various industrial enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
But the streets in her neighborhood are clean, the surrounding homes and yards 
are generally well-maintained, and she can leave her house without fearing for 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
Her neighborhood is, in short, a decent place to live that is affordable to 
someone like Rogelia Gomez. To her, that puts Commerce in the heavenly 
category. 
</P>
<P>
"I am really very happy here," Gomez says, speaking through an interpreter (her 
daughter). "I don't want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez is not alone in her enthusiasm for her new town; Commerce residents 
generally seem to rave about their community. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, this small city, situated six miles southeast of downtown Los 
Angeles at the intersection of the Long Beach and Santa Ana freeways, doesn't 
appear to be home to anything except warehouses and factories. 
</P>
<P>
Only 7.5% of the city's 6.6 square miles is zoned residential, while 71% is 
industrial or commercial. (The rest is parkland, public land and streets.) In 
fact, Commerce's most famous man-made landmark is not a church or a museum or a 
stately Victorian home; it's the old Uniroyal Tire &amp; Rubber plant, a huge 
Assyrian-style fortress that faces the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, "Commerce" is not a misnomer. 
</P>
<P>
About 70,000 people work in Commerce every day. At quitting time the vast 
majority of them stream out of the city on their way home to the nearby 
residential communities of Bell, Downey or Montebello, or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But 12,000 people live in Commerce, mostly in neighborhoods of small wood-frame 
or stucco homes with chain-link-fenced back yards. There are five residential 
neighborhoods in the city, each a small pocket of houses separated from the 
others by commercial or industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
Home prices in Commerce range from less than $100,000 for a 
government-subsidized low-income home to $300,000 for a three-bedroom home in 
the newer development known as "The Village," which features landscaped yards, 
fireplaces and wood fences in the back yards. Most of the homes in Commerce, 
however, are small bungalows in the $165,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
Except for The Village, which is home to some mid-level managers for the 
surrounding industries, Commerce residents are predominantly blue-collar. In 
terms of the residents' economic status it is not a wealthy city. The 1989 
median household income in Commerce was $26,000, far below the countywide 
median of $38,900. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, all that could make Commerce sound like a less than ideal place to 
live. So why would Rogelia Gomez or anyone else rave about living there? The 
answer is simple. The industrial nature of the city gives Commerce a tremendous 
tax base, which allows the city to provide a wide range of services other 
communities just can't afford. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the city operates its own bus service, which is free to residents. 
There are also 35 acres of immaculately maintained parks and recreation 
facilities, including a swimming pool, indoor pistol range, baseball diamonds, 
youth programs and so on, all of which are free to residents. (Non-residents 
who work in the city can use the facilities for a $4 a month fee.) 
</P>
<P>
The city also operates its own post office for the convenience of residents and 
businesses, and provides reduced-rate cable television service ($9.95 a month 
basic service) through a city-owned cable system. There are four public 
libraries -- but no library district fees -- three fire stations, heavy police 
protection (provided by the Sheriff's Department on a contract basis), and four 
city-funded security patrols. 
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the Montebello Unified School District, of which Commerce 
is a part, there are English-as-a-second-language classes offered in Bristow 
Park in the northwestern part of the city, where many new immigrants live. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce also offers city-funded low-interest housing loans for senior citizens 
and low-income families, as well as low-interest home improvement and equity 
loans. Trash pick-up is free. And every year on its incorporation anniversary 
the city gives each of Commerce's 3,300 households a free gift. This year it 
was a flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
By any city's standards, it's an impressive list of services and perks and 
freebies; for a tiny city tucked between two freeways on the non-affluent side 
of town, it's nothing short of amazing. It makes City of Commerce sound a 
little like the Sweden of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"One reason I like it is that everything's free," says Eva Long, 70, who bought 
her three-bedroom, one-bath house on Hepworth Avenue in 1943 for $3,800 ($500 
down, $27 a month). Long is particularly proud of the city's four libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"Four libraries in a city this size is pretty special," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, perhaps, it was libraries -- or the lack of them -- that created 
City of Commerce. Back in 1960, community residents decided to form their own 
city when the county tried to close the local branch library and let the 
residents make do with a bookmobile. 
</P>
<P>
Although some nearby cities cast greedy eyes on the area's industrial base -- 
industry puts a lot of money in government tax coffers but demands relatively 
little in government services -- the residents managed to stave off other 
suitors and create the independent City of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
According to Long and others, the city's name was simply picked out of thin air 
in the rush to file incorporation papers. 
</P>
<P>
Long has seen a lot of changes since she moved to Commerce. Besides the 
demographic changes, many of the city's old "smoke-stack industries" -- 
including a Chrysler plant -- have folded, and been replaced by less 
labor-intensive businesses, such as grocery distribution warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
The Uniroyal plant, for example, is now being rebuilt by Trammell Crow Co. as 
an office and specialty retail complex called "The Citadel." 
</P>
<P>
Commerce also is home to a huge poker parlor called the California Commerce 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
The club figured in one of two political corruption scandals that put 
Commerce's name in the news in the past. In 1984, three city councilmen and the 
city's economic development director pleaded guilty to soliciting and accepting 
bribes in a scheme to grant a poker parlor license in return for secret shares 
in the casino. In 1973, two city officials pleaded guilty to soliciting a 
$30-a-month bribe from a contractor doing work with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Commerce residents, Long has learned to live with industry as a 
not-too-distant neighbor. And she is still proud of her city. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where else I'd want to live," Long says. 
</P>
<P>
"There just isn't anything to dislike about it (the city)," agreed John 
Alvarez, 29. Alvarez, who works as a bartender at a nearby hotel, was born and 
raised on Elk Grove Avenue in Commerce. Eight years ago, when he got married, 
the city gave him a $28,000 low-interest loan to build a two-bedroom home 
behind the house he grew up in. His parents still live in the house in front. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great parks and recreation program," said Alvarez, who, 
incidentally, serves on a local citizens parks advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
"Commerce is a rich little city; we don't pay for any of our programs. Little 
League, arts and crafts programs -- it's all free. If you have kids, Commerce 
has a lot to offer." 
</P>
<P>
All this isn't to say there aren't some problems in Commerce. According to Rene 
Herrera, a real estate agent who lives in the city, one severe problem is 
overcrowding in some homes and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
He points out that among recent immigrants who want to buy homes in Commerce 
but have little financial resources, it's common for two or more families to 
pool their money to buy and live in one house. That has caused friction between 
old-line Commerce residents and some newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to have two families, really, to be able to afford it," Herrera 
said. "But it is a problem." 
</P>
<P>
"That's a phenomenon that's not unusual throughout the Los Angeles area," 
responded Ray Ramirez, the city's economic development coordinator. "We try to 
prevent that, but it's very hard sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
There also has been some encroaching gang activity in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
And, again, there is always the inescapable -- and not always aesthetically 
pleasing -- presence of industry in this city, sometimes almost in one's back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, for most residents those problems seem minor compared to what 
Commerce has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We do live around a lot of industry," says Jamie Cadenas, 30, a homemaker and 
mother of three children. "But you have to accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Cadenas has lived in a rental home on Gaspar Avenue for the past three years, 
but she and her husband, a city employee, want to buy a home in Commerce. 
They're hoping to be chosen in a drawing for eight new $90,000 to $150,000 
homes in the Veterans Park area. As you might expect, the city is underwriting 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Commerce a lot," Cadenas said. "The city really does a lot for you. I 
think we're very lucky to live here."

TIPS FOR NEW CONDO ASSOCIATION LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENNY L. KASS, Kass is a Washington lawyer and newspaper columnist 
specializing in real estate and tax matters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I have just become the president of a medium-sized condominium 
association. Although we are in pretty good shape, I would welcome your advice 
and ideas on some of the things that I should be looking for as I proceed with 
my presidential duties. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: I do not know whether to congratulate you or give you condolences on 
your assuming the presidency of your condominium association. 
</P>
<P>
The job takes long hours, has many responsibilities, and you no doubt will 
suffer the abuse of some of the unit owners on any policy decision that is 
made. And, as you know, you do not get any pay for taking on these 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing I would do as president of a condominium association is review 
the directors and officers liability insurance policy that covers the board of 
directors. We are a very litigious society, and presidents and boards of 
directors are being sued by dissident unit owners on a regular basis. Make sure 
there is adequate coverage, in the event a lawsuit is filed against you or 
other board members. 
</P>
<P>
The next thing is to sit down with the management company. Spend a couple of 
hours going through all of their procedures, such as collection of condominium 
fees, handling of building maintenance and personal matters. If your 
condominium has staff assistants, you should review your employment practices 
and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
I also would review condominium documents carefully. Discuss these documents 
with the former president of the association, as well as with the association's 
attorney. I have talked to many presidents of condominium associations who have 
not bothered to read the governing documents of their own organization. 
</P>
<P>
The bylaws and the rules and regulations may have been adequate when the 
condominium was first created. But as the years go by, you will find that 
changes will be necessary. Some changes can be incorporated into the rules and 
regulations, and you will not have to go through the difficult -- if not 
impossible -- task of amending the bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
You should also review the overall insurance coverage with the insurance 
company that carries the master policy for the association. Make sure you 
understand the extent of coverage (or lack thereof) for all possible insurance 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if a fire occurs in one unit and spreads across the common element 
hallway into another unit, is there coverage for both units and, if so, what is 
the deductible under the terms of your policy? 
</P>
<P>
You should obtain a copy of Roberts' Rules of Order, to determine how meetings 
are to be conducted. While your association may not be governed by Roberts' 
Rules, it nevertheless is a good guide to help you understand the process. 
There are professional parliamentarians who will be happy to spend some time 
(for a nominal fee) giving you guidance on conducting the board meetings, as 
well as the annual association meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Conducting meetings is an art, and you must have complete confidence to be able 
to control the meeting -- while at the same time permitting the membership an 
opportunity to fully discuss all concerns and problems. 
</P>
<P>
It is also suggested that you review all existing contracts. Some may be 
outdated, and by comparative shopping, you may be able to save your association 
a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
You should determine whether the level of communication to the unit owners is 
adequate. Does your condominium association have a newsletter, and if so, how 
often does it come out? It is strongly recommended that every condominium 
association, regardless of size, have some form of communication to each of the 
unit owners at least three or four times a year. At the very least, summaries 
of the board meeting should be available to all unit owners. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of these minutes is to keep a short, concise history of the 
decision-making activities of your board of directors. They should be filed 
neatly in chronological order, for future reference. 
</P>
<P>
What is the policy regarding board meetings? Are they open and accessible to 
all unit owners? Do you meet in a small apartment that does not permit more 
than a few board members to attend? Secrecy in condominium associations is 
perhaps one of the biggest problems that you will face as president of the 
condominium association. It is strongly recommended that all board meetings be 
open, unless you are discussing individual hardship cases or personnel matters 
affecting condominium staff. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of publications available regarding condominium 
associations, and you should contact the Community Assn. Institute to get a 
list of their publications. The address is 1423 Powhatan St., Suite 7, 
Alexandria, Va. 22314. If you are not a member of this worthwhile organization, 
you may want your association to join so that you may participate in its 
various conferences and seminars. 
</P>
<P>
As I have indicated, your job as president is a thankless task. However, you 
are no doubt willing to serve as president because you want to ensure the 
stability of the investment which you made in your condominium unit.

REAL ESTATE Q&amp;A: SELLERS NEED ALL THE HELP AN AGENT CAN GIVE THEM IN 
TODAY'S MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert J. Bruss, Robert J. Bruss, a syndicated real estate columnist

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We are having trouble selling our home, which has been on the market 
for almost nine months. The asking price is reasonable, based on an appraisal 
of our home when we put it up for sale. We tried listing it with a real estate 
agent, but she was totally incompetent, so we fired her after about 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
Each weekend we hold an open house, which we advertise in the newspaper. Since 
the location is good, we have lots of lookers, but have not had any offers so 
far. My wife says we should wait to sell, but I want to get it over with, so we 
can move by winter. Why doesn't our home sell? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your home hasn't sold because you are doing everything wrong. It sounds 
like you are just testing the market and are not highly motivated to sell 
unless you get your price, which is based on a possibly outdated appraisal. By 
trying to sell your home alone without a professional real estate agent you are 
at a severe disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
Your first step should be to take down the "For Sale by Owner" sign. Look at 
your house critically. Get it into tiptop condition. If it needs fixing up, 
such as painting, cleaning and repairing, get the work done. New carpets and 
fresh landscaping also can be very profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is to invite at least three real estate agents who have recently 
sold homes in your neighborhood to inspect your home and give their listing 
presentations. Each agent should give you a written "comparative market 
analysis" form showing recent sales prices of similar nearby homes, asking 
prices of comparable neighborhood homes now listed for sale (your competition) 
and the agent's recommended price for your home. 
</P>
<P>
Ask each agent for the names and phone numbers of their most recent home 
sellers. Then phone those sellers to inquire if they were in any way unhappy 
with the agent. 
</P>
<P>
If you are serious about selling your home you need all the help you can get 
from a professional agent. In the current buyer's market in most cities you 
need the powerful multiple listing service to expose your home to as many 
prospective buyers and other agents as possible. You only have one home to 
sell, but it's hard to compete with the local multiple listing service, which 
has hundreds of homes available and dozens of agent members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Use 'Over-55' Tax Break if Unneeded 
</P>
<P>
Q: We just sold our condo and are overjoyed at finding a buyer after having it 
on the market for sale almost six months. Our net profit is about $70,000, 
including the deferred gain from the sale of our previous residence, which we 
sold about six years ago. But we are receiving conflicting information on that 
"over 55 rule" $125,000 tax break. As we are buying a townhouse which costs 
just a little more than our condo's sales price, our tax man says we can roll 
over our profit and not pay any tax on our sales profit. But a friend says we 
should use the $125,000 exemption now because Congress might take that tax 
break away. What do you advise? 
</P>
<P>
A: If Congress takes away the "over-55 rule" $125,000 home sale tax exemption 
every senator and member of congress would have the wrath of the powerful 
American Assn. of Retired Persons (AARP) to contend with and would surely be 
defeated at reelection time. This is one of the safest tax breaks and there is 
no talk of abolishing it. 
</P>
<P>
However, since you are buying a replacement principal residence of equal or 
greater cost within 24 months before or after the sale of your old residence 
you are eligible for the "roll-over residence replacement rule," IRC 1034, 
which is available to home sellers of any age. Therefore, you can save your 
once-per-lifetime $125,000 home sale exemption for future use. Your tax adviser 
wisely suggested that you use this major tax deferral. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oral Agreement in Sale Unenforceable 
</P>
<P>
Q: We made a $5,000 deposit to buy a home. After some negotiation, we agreed on 
the price and terms with the seller. We made it clear to our real estate agent 
that if we can't afford the mortgage payments we will cancel the sale. She has 
been unable to get us qualified for a fixed rate mortgage and we don't want one 
of those adjustable mortgages, so we want to cancel and get our $5,000 back. 
But the seller refuses to refund our money. He says there is nothing in our 
purchase contract about being able to back out. But it was clearly agreed with 
our agent we could get our money back if we couldn't get a mortgage. How can we 
get our refund? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Statute of Frauds requires binding contracts for the sale of real estate 
to be in writing. If you had an unwritten "side agreement" with the agent it is 
probably unenforceable because it was oral. Since a mortgage is available (but 
not on terms you like), and you failed to put a mortgage finance contingency 
clause in the written contract, you have several legal hurdles to overcome if 
you sue the seller for a refund. Please consult a real estate attorney for 
details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Sale Can Provide Tax-Deferred Dollars 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have about $75,000 equity in our home. Due to business debts, we must 
sell our home to pay off about $50,000 of overdue bills. However, we understand 
that if we are to avoid paying tax on our home sale profit we must buy a 
replacement home of equal or greater cost. As we are not eligible for that 
$125,000 "over 55 rule" exemption, is there any way out of our problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The "roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 
1034 says you must defer your profit tax when selling your principal residence 
and buying a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost within 24 
months before or after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Please notice this law says nothing about having to reinvest any cash received 
from the sale into the replacement home. In other words, you can sell for all 
cash and, if desired, buy a replacement home for nothing down such as by using 
a VA mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Let Buyers Move In Before Close 
</P>
<P>
Q: We recently sold our home and moved out. 
</P>
<P>
As the buyers were moving from out of town, and their mortgage would take 
several weeks to close, they talked us into letting them move into the house 
before the title was transferred. When the time for closing finally arrived, 
the buyers were about $5,000 short, so we had to make them a second mortgage 
loan. In addition, they found numerous little defects in the house which were 
trivial, but they got us to credit $2,000 for repairs. Our advice? Never let 
buyers move into a home before the sale is recorded. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thank you for that valuable advice. I fully agree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FHA Lenders Will Not Strike Mortgage Policy 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please unconfuse me about mortgage insurance. Several times you have written 
about how to cancel mortgage insurance when the loan-to-value ratio drops below 
80%. But when I wrote to my lender about canceling the insurance on my FHA 
mortgage, I was told the lender's policy is to never cancel FHA insurance. My 
loan is 14 years old and there is no need for such insurance, so my premium is 
a waste of money. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, there is nothing you can do to force your FHA lender to cancel your 
MMI (mutual mortgage insurance) premium. Although I will get nasty letters from 
FHA officials telling me FHA insurance can be canceled at the lender's 
discretion, I have yet to hear of a lender foolish enough to do so. But the 
good news is when you eventually pay off your FHA mortgage, you will become 
entitled to a partial refund of the MMI premium you have paid. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, you confused your FHA insurance with PMI (private mortgage 
insurance) which is required on 90% and 95% conventional mortgages. Depending 
on the lender, PMI can usually be canceled when the loan balance drops below 
80% of the property's market value. But most lenders require the loan to be at 
least two years old before dropping the PMI. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Using MLS Can Be Breach of Agent's Duty 
</P>
<P>
Q: We listed our home for sale with a realtor recommended by a friend. I don't 
know much about real estate, but I do know the local realtors have a multiple 
listing service to share information on listings. After several weeks we 
noticed no agents from other brokerage offices had brought clients to inspect 
our house. Upon inquiry with our realtor she said her firm usually can sell the 
listings within its own offices, so there is no need to use the multiple 
listing service. We thought our house would be in the multiple listing service. 
What should we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Shame on your real estate agent for misleading you into thinking your home 
would be submitted to the local multiple listing service. The MLS is one of the 
most powerful sales devices real estate agents have and it is shocking your 
agent isn't using it to get your home sold. 
</P>
<P>
You should know the reason your agent didn't put your home into the MLS is the 
agent and her broker earn a bigger commission if the sale takes place within 
the listing firm. If you were told the MLS would be used, but it wasn't, the 
agent breached her fiduciary duty to you. The matter should be reported to the 
state real estate commissioner for investigation and possible revocation of the 
agent's license. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Let Brokers Settle Their Own Disputes 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several months ago we listed our home for sale with broker A. The listing 
expired with the home unsold. Then we listed our home with broker B who found 
us a buyer within a few weeks. We accepted the offer. Then broker A somehow 
found out who the buyer was. She claims she showed our home to the buyer and is 
entitled to half of the sales commission. But broker B says broker A is not 
entitled to any part of the commission, since the first listing expired. Do you 
think we owe half the sales commission to broker A? 
</P>
<P>
A: Without reading the first listing and studying its "savings clause," I can't 
tell if broker A is entitled to any part of the sales commission. A typical 
"savings clause" in most listings says the listing broker is entitled to a 
sales commission if, during the listing term, the broker registered with the 
seller a prospective buyer who was shown the home during the listing term, 
unless the home is subsequently listed with another real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
But smart home sellers stay out of sales commission disputes among real estate 
agents. This is the nasty side of the realty sales business. Most agents can 
settle their commission disputes through the arbitration procedure of the local 
Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Warranty Can't Compensate All Losses 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are preparing to list our home for sale. One realty agent suggests we pay 
about $300 for a warranty policy to protect our buyer in case something goes 
wrong with the house after the sale. But our home is only about three years old 
and has no serious defects. Do you think we should buy a warranty policy? 
</P>
<P>
A: One-year home warranty policies pay for repairs to the home plumbing, 
wiring, furnace, water heater and built-in appliances. However, there are many 
exclusions -- such as for the roof, foundation, plumbing outside the home's 
perimeter, air conditioning and swimming pool -- unless an extra premium is 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
Home warranty policies are considered sales inducements. They also help protect 
home sellers and real estate agents against claims from buyers for problems 
that develop after the sale from covered losses. However, please don't think 
these one-year home warranty policies protect buyers from every possible loss.

SPEAKING OUT: SEVEN OBSTACLES FOR A FIRST-TIME HOME BUYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MOREY STETTNER, Stettner, a first-time home buyer, has been named to the 
board of directors of his homeowners association. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a first-time home buyer, I cannot help but wonder how normal people undergo 
the stress of purchasing a house and remain sane. 
</P>
<P>
To buy a home, I count no less than seven separate obstacles that can sabotage 
even the best laid plans of the most meticulous consumer. 
</P>
<P>
The moment you decide to search for a new home, real estate agents will shove 
their way into your life with ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
At first, I sought the help of experienced agents when visiting open houses. 
With faces aglow, they hailed my decision to buy and launched a barrage of 
questions, while dishing out business cards and dispensing stale advice. I 
heard the same lines over and over, "A second bathroom will increase resale 
value" and "Be careful of streets lined with RVs." 
</P>
<P>
After spending three afternoons with three seasoned agents, I concluded that 
these well-intentioned salespeople were a waste of time. They showed me homes 
that did not fit my needs, drove in confused circles while unfolding a series 
of street maps, and talked incessantly of their big sales in faraway 
neighborhoods (reminding me of the fisherman who brags about his giant catch). 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I decided to search on my own. The next obstacle introduced itself 
once I found the townhome that would, two months later, be mine. 
</P>
<P>
The "For Sale by Owner" sign in the front window caught my attention, and after 
a two-hour chat with the seller, I knew I wanted to make an offer. 
</P>
<P>
After exchanging officially worded counteroffers, the seller and I settled on a 
purchase price, only to dicker over such matters as who would pay the transfer 
tax and who would choose the termite inspector. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, I find it amusing that after agreeing to spend tens of thousands 
of dollars, I could have come so close to canceling the whole deal over a $50 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
Obstacle No. 3 enters the picture after you make the decision to buy. At that 
point you become a virtual employment service, hiring an escrow officer, a 
lender, a home inspector, pest inspector, appraiser and assorted other players 
who get paid for reasons that escape me. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that once you enter escrow, every day counts. If an appraiser 
fails to show for an appointment, if a lender proves suddenly recalcitrant, if 
an inspector refuses to return calls, you are left adrift in a sea of murky 
contracts and financial commitments. 
</P>
<P>
You may see yourself as a good organizer or an excellent personnel manager, but 
until you interview, hire and monitor the work of all these people, you have 
yet to truly scale the Mt. Everest of escrow. 
</P>
<P>
But within Obstacle 3 lurks Obstacle 4. The lender can (and probably will) 
impose all kinds of crazy conditions on granting you a loan. My bank initially 
courted me with enthusiasm. They congratulated me on prequalifying for the loan 
and secured a competitive interest rate when I gave them the thumbs-up. 
</P>
<P>
Yet once escrow began, so did the lender's strange and increasingly random 
demands: Explain every large deposit in your bank account over the last year. 
Document in detail all the reasons why you moved from New York to California. 
Sign your name three ways: with middle initial, without middle initial, and 
with your nickname. Oh, we forgot, you must sign and return these ten forms by 
4 today or no loan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I realize that careful underwriting allows lenders to run a profitable 
business. They need to ask questions about an applicant's job, assets and 
credit history. But the process takes on a life all its own, as if some 
paranoid bureaucrat is so afraid of making a bad loan that to end the 
interrogation signals defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there is an unwritten rule that a bank cannot finalize your loan until 
their file on you reaches three inches high. 
</P>
<P>
Obstacle No. 5, otherwise known as the Mystery of the Fees, requires a blind 
leap of faith. 
</P>
<P>
To buy a home, you must pay thousands of dollars in closing costs. You must 
learn a whole new vocabulary of points, origination fees and prepayment 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome this barrier, you must stop worrying about money. You must view 
your dwindling bank account as an abstraction, like an oil painting hanging in 
a museum, and detach yourself from the whole mess. 
</P>
<P>
Prepare yourself for an "appraisal fee" (pays for someone who spends 20 minutes 
fiddling with a tape measure to tell you what you already know: you are paying 
a reasonable price, a hefty "processing fee" (pays for . . . you got me) and 
vaguely annoying "discount points" (where's the discount?). 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, you may find it liberating to toss money away with total 
abandon. Today I laugh when recalling all those silly fees, and I do not fret 
as much over where and how to spend my money. 
</P>
<P>
After completing the escrow experience, you will never feel quite as attached 
to money as you once did. Consider this free therapy. 
</P>
<P>
In an age of stress management seminars, the next obstacle is a sign of the 
times: worry control. If you are the anxious sort, you will just love buying a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, with every ring of the phone, bad news threatens to explode in your 
face. Will the sellers change their mind? Will the appraisal reflect the price 
you paid? Will the bug inspector find a nest of rodents residing under the 
toilet? Will the place burn down the very day your title is recorded? 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, if you conquer these six obstacles, then the final test seems almost 
anticlimactic. Call it The Move. 
</P>
<P>
To orchestrate the arrival of all your belongings on the desired date takes a 
mix of planning and sheer luck. Watch for movers who scrape the legs of your 
desk along your freshly painted walls. And wipe those feet before you soil your 
new carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Although my move proved relatively smooth, the coup de grace came when my 
escrow officer sent over a bottle of wine with a red ribbon around it. She told 
me my case was a breeze, and she wished that all her deals were so easy. I 
guess that means it's all over.

Barbara Campbell, formerly of Kona Village on the Big Island of Hawaii, has 
taken wing and settled at Kamuela (also on the Big Island), where she operates 
a lodging service called Hawaii's Best Bed &amp; Breakfasts. Everything from 
B&amp;Bs to private cottages. Her headquarters are in upcountry Kamuela (10/20

Dee Dickson. 
</P>
<P>
High on Campbell's list is a converted barn with two bedrooms, a kitchen, 
living room, fireplace, TV, telephone, stereo. (The owners live in a separate 
cottage nearby.) Another rental faces Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, with a view all 
the way to the Pacific. Campbell's own Waimea Gardens cottage features antique 
furnishings and a kitchen where guests prepare their own breakfasts with 
ingredients supplied by Campbell (she lives just next door).

WASHINGTON IRVING'S 'TALES OF THE ALHAMBRA' RELIVED ON ROMANTIC TOUR OF GRANADA 
PALACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARIA NILSSON, Nilsson is a Chicago-based free-lancer who writes frequently 
about Spain.

GRANADA, Spain 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Give him alms, woman, for there is nothing in life, nothing, so sad as to be 
blind in Granada. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Francisco de Icaza 
</P>
<P>
Washington slept here. Washington Irving, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Irving, the author and diplomat, left Madrid in 1829 and traveled south to the 
Andalusia region. Accompanied by a Russian friend, he ventured to Granada on a 
solitary mountain road then controlled by bandits. 
</P>
<P>
A century ahead of Ernest Hemingway, Irving wrote of his travels in Spain. 
Inspired by his book "Tales of the Alhambra," my husband and I visited Granada 
and the Alhambra as part of an Andalusian holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The Alhambra, a palace and fortress high above the city, was the last Moorish 
bastion on the Iberian Peninsula and residence of the Spanish Christian 
royalty, Ferdinand and Isabella. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1700s, the palace started to decay and the city remained pretty 
much ignored by travelers for the rest of the century. 
</P>
<P>
During the romantic l9th Century, Granada attracted artists such as Claude 
Debussy, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. But it was Irving's writings that had 
the strongest impact on Granada's fame. Thousands of travelers come daily to 
visit this town in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Searching for the spirit of Irving's tales, we walked up to the Albacin. This 
old Moorish quarter is a cluster of whitewashed houses and winding streets. 
</P>
<P>
A horseshoe arch, piercing the remnants of an ancient wall, opened into a long, 
green plaza. Families sat on benches. An old man, leaning on his cane, raised 
his head. "Welcome to the Albaicin," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A ball rolled by, with a child in pursuit. Two girls in tight-fitting skirts -- 
one orange, the other bright green -- leisurely swayed by, arm in arm. All the 
men turned their heads, including the old man. Water splashed behind us. It was 
an old woman, emptying a bucket in the gutter. The sound of laughter, music and 
plates clanking from a cafe attracted our attention. The smell of food invited 
us in. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, flamenco music poured from a cassette player. My husband, a flamenco 
aficionado, asked a regular about the singer and the conversation immediately 
turned to the popular dance form. 
</P>
<P>
"Oye, Pepe!" shouted our new acquaintance, to a slender, sharp-featured man. 
"Give us a song." 
</P>
<P>
As if only waiting for the invitation, Pepe came over and began to sing. He 
kept the rhythm by softly clapping his hands. His concentration was total. 
Conversation came to a halt. His voice rose, clear and sharp. Pepe's friends 
encouraged him. With a clap and a stomp he finished, and everyone cheered. 
</P>
<P>
After we left the cafe, Antonio, a local we had met in the cafe, took us to see 
examples of Moorish architecture. A contractor, he grudgingly remarked, "Old 
heritage is all very well, but a man can no longer put up a board, much less 
tear down a brick in his own home, before the city inspectors come running to 
check that it's done right." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking fast, with a classic Andalusian accent, Antonio said: "Since you like 
old houses, I'll give you a tip. You simply have to see Dar-al Horra Palace. 
It's precious, and right here in Albaicin, too." 
</P>
<P>
Following Antonio's directions, we ended up in a narrow street running parallel 
to the ancient city wall. A small sign marked the entrance. An older man opened 
it and peeked out, seemingly surprised to see visitors. His wife joined him to 
guide us around. 
</P>
<P>
In the center of a cool patio, a dormant basin reflected sun rays to the wall. 
Lush, green plants filled every corner of the cool oasis. The rooms had 
decorated walls, beautiful arches and carved woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
Dar-al Horra, explained the caretaker, meant "House of the Queen." It once 
belonged to the mother of Boabdil, the last Moorish king of Granada. In the 
15th Century, the palace was one of the centers of power in the city. 
</P>
<P>
From a tower, we overlooked luxurious gardens and pools of rich, modern homes 
literally clinging to the city wall. 
</P>
<P>
"See the white church, up in Sacromonte?" asked the caretaker's wife, speaking 
to my husband, who is a photographer. "That's San Miguel El Alto. You can take 
pretty pictures from up there." 
</P>
<P>
Farther up the hill, heading to the Sacromonte, Gypsies accosted us with offers 
to see "authentic" flamenco. Climbing past the last houses, we ventured into a 
winding path, bordered by thorns and uninhabited caves. The view from the 
church was breathtaking. A green valley separated the Albaicin from the 
Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra is an Arabic word that describes a reddish color. True to its name, 
the palace glowed with the afternoon sun against a backdrop of snow-covered 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Fat, yellow letters by a hole in the wall caught my eye: "Ojo ladrones" (watch 
out for thieves). I was struck by the solitude of the spot. Heeding the 
warning, we retreated, past caves and shacks. Perhaps the descendants of the 
smugglers who frightened Washington Irving still lurked about. 
</P>
<P>
Plaza Nueva, at the foot of the Alhambra, is busy in the morning. The outdoor 
tables at Cafe Lisboa were filled. Behind us, two businessmen discussed a trip 
while dunking churros in hot chocolate. Another man gulped his espresso in one 
sip, put down the payment and rushed off. He stopped at the corner, picked up a 
paper and ran across the busy street. Waiters in white jackets and black pants 
darted between tables, elegantly balancing their shiny metal trays. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing the morning coffee ritual, we were ready for the climb up the narrow 
Cuesta Gomerez to the Alhambra. Guitar makers and souvenir shops dotted the 
street. Copies of Irving's book, in several languages, were displayed in every 
window. Taxis zoomed past. I wished we had taken one. A bus barely squeezed 
through the narrow Gate of the Granadas farther up the hill. 
</P>
<P>
It was at this gate, I had read, that Irving met Mateo Jimenez, a Gypsy who 
called himself "Son of the Alhambra." In Irving's account, Jimenez negotiated 
for a room with the squatters who had taken over the palace and became the 
American's guide, storyteller and valet. 
</P>
<P>
We were welcomed to The Alhambra by a Gypsy woman who gave me a red carnation. 
"Toma guapa, te la regalo (here you are, honey, it's a gift)," she said. 
Seconds later, she began to ask me for money. Annoyed, I returned the wilting 
flower. 
</P>
<P>
Walking under a soft canopy of trees, we reached the entrance, the Gate of 
Justice. Above the outer arch of the Moorish tower, a large hand is carved into 
the stone. A key also appears over the inner arch. 
</P>
<P>
These symbols of Moslem faith were given a different meaning by popular belief 
in Irving's days. The founder of the palace was a magician who cast a spell on 
the buildings. On the day when the hand would reach down and grasp the key, 
legend had it, the spell would break and the palace would crumble to ruins, 
revealing all the treasures hidden by the fleeing Moors. 
</P>
<P>
I was first impressed by the extraordinary carved walls inside the Nazaride 
palace of the Alhambra. Twisting passages and steps disoriented me. Through a 
small door I came out into the light. Next to an oblong pool, past an 
elaborately adorned colonnade, is the Hall of Ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
The walls shine with colorful tiles and meandering Arabic inscriptions. Ornate 
arches support an immense wooden cupola. 
</P>
<P>
I entered a small doorway, walked a few steps and was bombarded by golden light 
and patterns of shadow. A forest of slender columns with intricately decorated 
capitals created a feeling of weightlessness. I was in the Courtyard of the 
Lions, named after a fountain supported on the backs of a dozen stone lions. 
</P>
<P>
A basin in the adjacent Hall of Abencerrajes reflects the columns and gardens 
outside. The space suddenly filled with a tour group. Their English-speaking 
guide related Irving's tale of the 36 knights who were decapitated here by the 
jealous and vengeful Boabdil. 
</P>
<P>
A Spanish group came in, followed by a French group. Their voices, multiplied 
by the echo, rang in my ears. I found myself staring at a red spot on the 
floor, pointed out by a guide. Before my eyes it seemed to transform itself 
into a dark pool of blood. I rushed out to get some air. 
</P>
<P>
We were shown Irving's quarters, normally closed to the public. Above the door, 
a plaque commemorates the creation of his tales. Originally built for King 
Charles V, the rooms are fully furnished, including a piano supposedly used by 
Irving. 
</P>
<P>
He had an excellent view over the white Albaicin. In the city far below, the 
bells of the cathedral rang for Mass. Next to the immense Renaissance church is 
the Royal Chapel, mausoleum of Ferdinand and Isabella. 
</P>
<P>
The grand interior is centered around their reclining marble statues. 
Underneath, in the narrow crypt, simple coffins momentarily reduce the 
legendary kings to ordinary mortals. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 p.m., the streets filled with people taking an afternoon paseo, or stroll. 
Most cafes and bars were packed. On the sidewalks, people stood in groups 
talking, with beer or Coke in hand. Weaving our way through the crowds, we 
entered the nearest bar. 
</P>
<P>
While we ordered tapas, a young man asked us where we were from. In a natural 
Andalusian manner, he invited us for unas copas (glasses of wine) and 
introduced us to his friends, all students at the University of Granada. 
</P>
<P>
The sun set the skies ablaze. From a terrace at the Albaicin, we watched the 
Sierra Nevada and the Alhambra take warmer tones with the setting sun. 
</P>
<P>
The white walls of the Generalife, the royal summer retreat above the Alhambra, 
were surrounded by lush, green gardens. In Irving's "Pilgrim of Love," a king 
built the palace to shelter his son from the temptations of love. 
</P>
<P>
I, too, found it difficult to leave, and was reminded of something Irving once 
wrote: "A little further and Granada, the Vega and the Alhambra, were shut from 
my view and thus ended one of the pleasantest dreams of a life which the reader 
perhaps may think has been but too much made up of dreams."

THE TASTE OF TRAVEL: SAMPLING WINE PUBS OF STRASBOURG CAN BE AN ENLIGHTENING 
EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
STRASBOURG, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'd miscalculated how long it would take me to drive from Paris east to 
Strasbourg. 
</P>
<P>
It's only about 300 miles, but on the way I stopped to taste champagne in 
Reims. By the time I reached Strasbourg, negotiated the narrow, one-way streets 
and found my hotel, it was already after 10 p.m. At that hour in most places in 
France, you need good luck to find anything to eat other than a soggy croque 
monsieur. It could have been very grim. 
</P>
<P>
Armed only with the address of a winstub (wine pub) near the cathedral, I 
hurried down empty cobblestone streets flanked with tall, half-timbered houses 
so old that their steep-pitched roofs had leaned into each other through the 
years. A glow of light that glimpsed through checked curtains told me I'd found 
S'Burjersteuewel. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's what the sign says, though most everyone calls it Chez Yvonne. 
When I opened the door, voices filtered out from behind a red velvet curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling it aside, we stepped into a brightly lit room filled with what seemed 
like all of Strasbourg -- talking, laughing, eating and drinking. Waiters 
sailed by with platters of sausages and sauerkraut, and filled pitcher after 
pitcher with local white wine. 
</P>
<P>
It was a little startling, like suddenly walking on stage from the darkened 
wings, but YvonneHaller took us firmly in hand and found us a place at one of 
the crowded tables. 
</P>
<P>
We were wedged between an elegant older woman who was lustily digging into a 
pig's knuckle, and a young couple attacking an overflowing plate of choucroute 
garnished with sausages, smoked pork and bacon. 
</P>
<P>
Madame Haller was back soon, surveying her domain through white harlequin 
glasses. She delivered us some Gruyere salad in a mustardy vinaigrette, slabs 
of onion tart, boiled tongue with a puckery sauce and warm potato salad. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, she brought a sugar-dusted apple tart, plus a slice of tarte au 
fromage blanc, a subtly sweetened cheesecake with raspberry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
For good company and inexpensive, delicious fare, Strasbourg's winstubs can't 
be beat. Clustered in the narrow streets around the gothic sandstone cathedral, 
they date to the last century, when producers from wine villages south of 
Strasbourg opened winstubs as a way to introduce their wines to city folk. 
</P>
<P>
One winstub tradition is the stammtisch, a large table reserved for regulars 
who sit down and eat together every day. If you're only a party of two, they'll 
simply tuck you in with other people at a big table. And it turns out to be 
fun. It's also a great way to decide what to order. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Jenny, who owns the Strasbourg winstub Le Clou, describes the winstub 
as the melting pot of Alsatian life, since workers, businessmen, artists, 
students and society people all gather to mingle and eat. 
</P>
<P>
Le Clou is really the Elaine's of Strasbourg. The kitchen is open until 1 in 
the morning, thus it's a favorite haunt of show business, theater and music 
people who come for the company and the good food. 
</P>
<P>
You can order steak tartare or perfectly grilled lamb chops, but her backenoffe 
-- the slow-simmered stew of veal, pork and beef, with pigs' feet and potatoes 
-- is one of the best in town. Also good bets: the choucroute cooked in 
Riesling and the wine maker's tourte, a savory meat and mushroom pie made at 
harvest time. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks away at San Sepulchre, the proprietor greets you with a towel slung 
over his shoulder, squeezes you in at a table and then rushes off to the 
kitchen, where his 75-year-old mother mans the stoves. 
</P>
<P>
This cozy, rustic winstub looks as if time stopped when it opened in 1936. And 
the stammtisch, where a dozen old men meet every day before lunch, has been 
going just as long. Representatives from the European Council rub elbows with 
stout matrons and young girls on a shopping spree, and the postman stopping in 
for a nip. 
</P>
<P>
Monsieur Lauch dashes back and forth, joking with customers while he carves a 
ham on the bone -- which is exactly what to order here. Cooked very slowly in 
bread dough, it is pale, moist and delicious, an entirely superlative ham 
served with mustard, cornichons and horseradish. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of Le Pont Couvert, the medieval covered bridge in the section of 
old Strasbourg known as La Petite France, is an informal bierstub (which also 
serves wine) called L'Ami Schutz, where you can feast on traditional Alsatian 
fare while Judy Kael sings Edith Piaf songs. 
</P>
<P>
Specialties include l'esiigbroda, beef marinated and cooked in vinegar and 
served with spatzle noodles; saupfeffer, pork marinated in peppers, and coq au 
Riesling, chicken cooked in Riesling. In the fall there are all sorts of game 
from the Vosges Mountains; the chef's father is a hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Along the wine road that runs from Marlenheim, just a few miles west of 
Strasbourg, between the Vosges and the Ill River south to Thann, there are 
several country-stryle winstubs. 
</P>
<P>
Wistub du Sommelier (wistub is the local spelling of winstub) in Bergheim 
features sophisticated home cooking and a list of wines to rival a two- or 
three-star restaurant. Owner Jean-Marie Stoeckel is a former best sommelier of 
France who offers half a dozen wines by the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Get set for foie gras in an old Gewurztraminer, a superlative choucroute garni, 
cinnamon-scented boudin noir with pickled turnips and house-smoked pork. Or an 
autumn salad of bitter greens, apples, mushrooms, duck gizzards and grapes. 
He'll also sell wine from his list to take out for a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Zum Pfifferhuss in nearby Ribeauville is a favorite with local chefs and wine 
makers. It's very informal, usually packed with people, and features dishes 
such as choucroute salad with poultry gizzards, smoked pork filet in a pastry 
crust, and blood sausage with apples. You can also taste a range of eaux de vie 
(brandy) from the master distiller Jean-Paul Mette, whose artisanal distillery 
is just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Winstub Arnold in Itterswiller is covered with cascades of red and pink 
geraniums. Tuck in your napkin and dig into slabs of their own goose foie gras 
served with warm toast (pain de mie) in a quilted box; salade Alsacienne 
(grated Gruyere with onion, cervelas sausage and head cheese in a mustardy 
vinaigrette); thick noisettes of venison with wild mushrooms and squiggly 
spaetzle noodles, or wild boar cooked in a blood-thickened red wine sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Bouquets of wildflowers grace the table. Vino 1756 Veritas is carved on the 
massive beam over the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
Life is sweet in Alsace.

Paul Gauguin was most fortunate to have had Madame Marie-Jeanne Gloanec as his 
landlady when he lived at her modest pension in this small town in southern 
Brittany off and on between 1886 and 1896. 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion she was even kind enough to take one of his paintings as 
payment for the board he couldn't pay. 
</P>
<P>
Madame Gloanec, however, was more benefactor than art connoisseur. She soon 
made a doormat out of Gauguin's painting. 
</P>
<P>
Gauguin and other members of the Pont-Aven School (Pierre Bonnard, Emile 
Bernard, Maurice Denis, Paul Serusier) were drawn here by the marvelous Breton 
light, brilliant yellow gorse and pastoral scenes of the Bois d'Amour ("Woods 
of Love") nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Pont-Aven had such an attraction for Gauguin that he returned here four times, 
three from Tahiti and once from Arles and his tumultuous relationship with 
Vincent van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
The Aven River flows down to an estuary on the Atlantic Ocean, once driving 
many flour mills along the way. So many that Pont-Aven became known as the town 
of "14 mills and 15 houses." 
</P>
<P>
Although Madame Gloanec may not have known much about art, she knew enough 
about business, eventually building a large hotel on the main square. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Air France flies nonstop to Paris. American, Pan Am, TWA, Delta, 
Continental and a clutch of foreign carriers offer service with stops and 
changes. Air Inter will fly you from Paris to Quimper or Lorient in an hour, 
both 22 miles from Pont-Aven. 
</P>
<P>
A round-trip LAX-Paris ticket costs between $890 and $940 U.S., based on 
advance purchase, month and day of week flown. Air Inter charges $148 one way 
for the Paris-Quimper or Lorient leg. 
</P>
<P>
French National Railroads (call (213) 451-5150) has a variety of rail passes 
for travel throughout France. Quimperle (nine miles) is the nearest station to 
Pont-Aven. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much: Give Pont-Aven and the surrounding countryside several days. 
Lodging costs are moderate, dining from high moderate to expensive. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The franc recently sold for 5.05 to the dollar, about 20 
cents each. Best times to visit are May-June (when flowers are beautiful) and 
September-October for the foliage and absence of crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hotel des Ajoncs d'Or (1 Place de l'Hotel de Ville; $38 to 
$46 double occupancy), named for the yellow gorse flowers, is on the town 
square. While bedrooms are on the small side, baths are sparkling and the new 
wing has bright rooms all done in delft blue. 
</P>
<P>
Take breakfast in a sunny room or on the flowered terrace. Fare is usually a 
choice of Breton crepes or the usual croissants and brioche. 
</P>
<P>
Le Moulin de Rosmadec (just off the main street; $84 double occupancy) is a 
15th-Century mill on a small stream that flows between the hotel and its 
restaurant in the town's most beautiful setting. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrooms are large, bright and decorated with antiques and great charm. There's 
a feeling of elegance and the patina of age throughout the mill, but only five 
rooms, so make reservations well in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Roz-Aven (on the river at port; $56-$96 double occupancy) is another 
charmer of warm Breton stone that dates from the 18th Century. Choose from 
bedrooms in traditional (one with old beams and wood paneling) or relatively 
modern style. 
</P>
<P>
Although a Breton breakfast of crepes is the only meal served, plans call for a 
dining room with seafood specialties to be opened later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: You won't get far in Brittany without running into 
crepes, either the thin ones made of white flour or the slightly thicker 
galettes made of buckwheat. The thin type is always served with a sweet filling 
of jams, berries, honey or liqueurs, while galettes could be stuffed with 
anything in the kitchen from mushrooms to a game ragout. Both very addictive, 
particularly when served, a local custom, with the region's cider. 
</P>
<P>
Breton cooking, apart from the crepes and seafood, usually gets short shrift 
from other Frenchmen, being regarded as rustic at best. However, we found 
interesting and imaginative dishes at everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Brittany's only wine of note are the muscadets, which come from along the Loire 
River near Nantes. The Loire muscadets and are light, off-dry, honeysweet in 
fragrance, have a nut-like flavor and go very well with the region's abundant 
seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Good local dining: Le Moulin de Rosmadec's restaurant, sporting a Michelin 
star, is the most beautiful and romantic place in town. The bar is a work of 
art, with decorations of beret ribbons from French military units of wars gone 
by. A huge fireplace, ancient beams, copper pots, fresh flowers and a variety 
of antiques add to the mill's charm. 
</P>
<P>
Meals run from $22 to $48 and offer such as Belon oysters, lamb estragon, sole 
in a champagne sauce and several tempting desserts. Patrons can dine outside in 
a flowery garden beside the mill stream. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room at Hotel des Ajoncs d'Or is much simpler in decor, but the 
colorful pottery and wooden bar give it a certain style and elan. A $15 menu 
here might include fish soup, mussels or six oysters, followed by a main course 
of steak or fish, then salad and dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Chez Candide (on the main street) is a creperie in one of the town's oldest 
buildings, with heavy, dark wooden tables and benches. Try its ham or cheese 
galettes for $2, or shoot the works with a banana, chocolate and whipped cream 
crepe for $4.50. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Chateau de Locguenole (23 miles in Hennebont; $119-$232 
double occupancy) is a baronial manor house that has been in owner Madame 
Alyette de la Sabliere's family for more than five centuries. The kitchen has 
two Michelin stars, which the restaurant has had for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
There are 30-foot Aubusson tapestries on dining-room walls, original period 
furnishings, family portraits, a huge pool and a spacious lawn bordered by 
stately trees leading down to the river. 
</P>
<P>
The superb food and service in the chateau's dining room costs $62 per person, 
and the wine list is formidable. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: First stop at the Pont-Aven Museum on the main square. Make sure 
to take in the short audiovisual presentation on the town's past and artists of 
the Pont-Aven School. There are photographs of Gauguin and the old town, plus 
an impressive selection of art. 
</P>
<P>
Walking around town, visitors will go past several of the old mills, 
innumerable art galleries and shops with fine selections of handsome Breton 
ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
Walk or drive up to the Bois d'Amour, noting the signs that identify spots that 
inspired painters. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Bois is a delightful 16th-Century country chapel. Simple inside, it 
has a wooden statue of Christ that was the model for Gauguin's Yellow Christ. 
</P>
<P>
There's a perfect spot for a picnic near the chapel, so stock up on food and 
wine before your hike. 
</P>
<P>

northwest France.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: LAUGHLIN HITS JACKPOT WITH SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAUGHLIN, Nev. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This hustling, bustling Colorado River gaming town, hardly out of puberty, has 
rapidly come of age -- thanks chiefly to seniors. 
</P>
<P>
One look in any Laughlin casino tells you just how completely mature travelers 
dominate this gambling scene. That's not a floating dense cloud of smoke, just 
a bobbing sea of gray hair. 
</P>
<P>
That seniors are No. 1 has been confirmed in a 1989 "Visitor Profile," prepared 
for the Convention and Visitor Authority of Las Vegas, 90 miles north. 
</P>
<P>
The study discloses that more than 70% of all Laughlin visitors are 50 years or 
older, the average being 56 years. Those 65 or older make up 33% of all 
visitors. Almost half (49%) of the visitors are retired (slightly more women 
than men -- 52% compared to 48%). Those 40 or under make up only 14% of the 
total. 
</P>
<P>
Keep those statistics in mind and reflect on these: More than three-quarters of 
all Laughlin visitors (77%) are repeaters, having averaged four trips in the 
past year. Nearly one-quarter (23%) of all visitors are day-trippers, the 
majority on senior-sponsored motor coach tours. 
</P>
<P>
What does the typical Laughlin (pronounced LAUF-lin) visitor do during a 
three-day, two-night stay? Without question, it fits the profile of a 
price-conscious senior traveler. 
</P>
<P>
They (57% of all visitors) mostly play the slots, more than 70% of which are 
the nickel and quarter variety in the eight major casinos. Similarly priced 
video poker is a second in play (19%). As a result, the Hilton has made 80% of 
its slots for nickels and quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Slot machines account for 78% of Laughlin's gaming revenue. Compare that to 45% 
for the Las Vegas Strip or 61% for downtown Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The only table game in Laughlin to get major play (15% of the visitors) is 
blackjack. Craps rates only 3%, roulette less. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows typical Laughlin visitors eat and sleep inexpensively. 
</P>
<P>
They spend only $21 a day on food and drink, mostly in low-priced casino hotel 
buffets or coffee shops. And with summer mid-week overnight rates from $19 to 
$31 a day single or double, it's easy to see why $36 is an average year-round 
overnight expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 years ago there were only a few small casinos, topped by Don 
Laughlin's Riverside. Laughlin not only put the town on the map and gave it his 
name, he set the way for growth. Ten years ago the population of Laughlin was 
less than 100. Today it draws more than 2 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
After the riverboat-style Colorado Belle opened with 1,238 rooms in 1987, it 
was followed by the 406-room Ramada Express and 989-room Harrah's de Rio. Last 
month, Sam's Town Gold River added 788 rooms to make it an even 1,000. 
Meanwhile the Riverside and others were adding more rooms as well. 
</P>
<P>
During this expansion, the average occupancy rate was rising from 95% to 98.8% 
and shows no sign of slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
Laughlin's total of 5,260 rooms will increase by 2,000 with the opening of the 
$90-million Flamingo Hilton on Aug. 1, a room and casino space increase that 
should have a bigger impact on Laughlin than the 4,000-room Excalibur did for 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton expects to fill all 1,000 rooms with a single or double rate starting at 
$31 a night midweek through December. That lure, plus four restaurants, a 
mini-showroom, Laughlin's first real room service, and 50,000 square feet of 
casino with mostly low denomination slots, and a large triple bus bay check-in 
for group tours, were all designed to cater to the mature traveler. 
</P>
<P>
Before next spring, the Laughlin Golden Nugget will open the first of two 
1,000-room towers and the Edgewater Hotel will add a 872-room tower to its 
present 600-room spread. Several other new casino-hotels and additions to older 
hotels are also in the works. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how much Laughlin expands, there's still a big difference between it 
and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
You won't find big-name stars in huge showrooms in Laughlin. Don's Celebrity 
Theater at the Riverside, with the likes of Sha Na Na, Connie Stevens and Merle 
Haggard, is about as big-time as it gets. And instead of the Follies Bergere, 
Laughlin recently hosted the Bulgarian Gypsy Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Other casino hotels have open showroom entertainment, mostly on a par with a 
good Las Vegas lounge act; sometimes better. The accent is on country, the Big 
Band era or good old-fashioned rock 'n' roll. There's no charge and usually no 
minimum. You can nurse a $1.50 beer through two sets without raising an 
eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
The Flamingo Hilton will add a mini-showroom with two afternoon and 
twice-nightly musical revues aimed right at the middle-of-the-road mature 
traveler. Next year's Gold Nugget also plans a small showroom. 
</P>
<P>
Although Las Vegas easily tops Laughlin in entertainment, I'd rate Laughlin's 
typical hotel buffets and low- to mid-priced meals to be as good -- often 
better -- than those of Las Vegas. I was impressed by the buffets and service 
at the Colorado Belle. But then, the Belle is part of the Circus-Circus 
operation, folks who know the buffet business well. 
</P>
<P>
There's usually a prime rib war going on in Laughlin, with prices $3.49 to 
$6.95 for generous prime rib dinners. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer, the sauna-like heat outdoors, with help from the Colorado River, 
tends to keep all but the most determined visitor inside the air-conditioned 
hotel-casinos. 
</P>
<P>
That's why most Laughlin casino-hotels have at least five dining rooms or snack 
areas. All feature buffets averaging $2.49 for breakfast and $3.99 for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
More hearty eaters or big winners will find better dining in the Colorado 
Belle's Orleans Room, Edgewater Hotel's Embers Room or La Hacienda at Harrah's. 
</P>
<P>
Lindy's Deli of New York City fame and a fine Italian restaurant, the Alta 
Villa, both in the Flamingo Hilton, also hold promise of gustatory 
gratification. 
</P>
<P>
Although Laughlin lacks gourmet dining, it has a few nice things that Las Vegas 
seems about to copy: nonsmoking casino sections and a policy allowing 
photo-taking inside casinos.

TRAVEL TO KENYA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your May 27 News and Briefs column made the following statement: "Last summer, 
the United States advised citizens against traveling to Kenya after two 
Americans were killed in an attack on a tourist bus. It has not rescinded the 
advice, despite high-level appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it likely to, the diplomats said, until Kenya offers proof of a 
reduction in crimes against tourists." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department Travel Advisory relates certain incidents and 
suggests certain precautions in particular areas of Kenya when traveling there. 
However, under no reading does it advise U.S. citizens against traveling to 
Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
For your information, since the poacher attack in June, 1989, there have been 
no reported injuries to tourists in Kenya, since the Kenyan government -- 
through its recently appointed director of wildlife -- has virtually eliminated 
the poachers (who had been the source of the attacks) from the wildlife parks. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of American tourists have indeed traveled to Kenya within the 
last year and experienced a safe, relaxed and enjoyable vacation.

One more letter about Jerry Hulse's article on Santa Fe ("The Lure of Santa 
Fe," June 3). You had to have grown up there to appreciate all the beauty and 
personality of the area. I don't return often enough, but I will always 
remember Santa Fe, and always with love and pride.

HOTEL REBUTTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I just stayed at the Hotel Amigo recommended in "Brussels is a City Not to be 
Ignored" by James T. Yenckel in your June 10 Travel Section. Unfortunately, I 
did not have the same pleasureable experience as your writer. 
</P>
<P>
I was quoted the highest price for a single (about $170 U.S.) and assumed I 
would have a choice room. 
</P>
<P>
There was no hot water for a bath in the morning. I complained to the desk and 
was told there was no problem with hot water. That evening, there was still no 
hot water. That night was record heat and there was no air conditioning in my 
room. I assumed there was none in the hotel. I learned otherwise by accident 
and asked to be transferred. I packed, moved, unpacked and tried the hot water. 
None. Four hours later, after complaining again, I had hot water. No price 
adjustment, no expression of regret or apology from the manager. 
</P>
<P>
I had arranged for a car to pick me up at checkout to take me to the airport. 
The concierge offered this service, but I wanted the driver I had used. My 
driver had come but had been sent away by the concierge, who said I was not in 
the hotel. These incidents almost ruined a wonderful vacation.

In the interesting article "Weaving Through Scot Isle" (Travel Section, May 
20), Beverly Beyer and Ed Rabey state: "Whiskey is spelled this way in Britain, 
and it always means Scotch." 
</P>
<P>
They are only half right. It is true that whisky always means Scotch in 
Britain, but it is always spelled whisky. Never whiskey.

A LESS TENSE WORLD DOESN'T ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR STRATEGIC DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
SDI: THE NO. 1 REASON TO DEPLOY REMAINS THE THREAT FROM THE SOVIET UNION, STILL 
MODERNIZING ITS MOST DEADLY NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

The Central Intelligence Agency estimates that by the year 2000 an additional 
15 nations could have the capability to launch ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Should there be a civil war in one of these nations, who would control the 
missiles? Who has the authority to launch them? Can one or more of the missiles 
fall into terrorist hands? What would America's options be? 
</P>
<P>
These questions underscore President Bush's declaration on the importance of 
maintaining the Strategic Defense Initiative: "In the 1990s, strategic defense 
makes more sense than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
That bastion of stability, Col. Moammar Kadafi of Libya, recently asserted that 
Arab nations must develop nuclear weapons within the next several years. He 
also said, ominously, that if he had had nuclear missiles when U.S. planes 
attacked Tripoli in 1986, he would have retaliated by firing them at New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
It would be easy to dismiss such talk as the rantings and ravings of a madman. 
It would also be irresponsible. Kadafi and others like him have the resources 
and the will to carry out their threats. 
</P>
<P>
But the No. 1 reason to deploy a strategic defense system remains the military 
threat posed by the Soviet Union. True, our relationship with Moscow has never 
been better. But the Soviets maintain an enormous military capability. And that 
capability is getting stronger where it is most threatening -- in strategic 
nuclear weapons. Despite reducing conventional forces and cutting defense 
spending, the Soviets are still pursuing a major strategic modernization 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Soviet Union produced 140 new ICBMs to our 12. Why, in this 
emerging age of easing tensions, do the Soviets feel a need to increase their 
strategic nuclear weaponry? 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that perestroika has made the Soviet Union more dangerous to the 
United States than ever before. The stability of its leadership can no longer 
be assumed. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze hinted as much in a 
statement that caught many Western analysts by surprise. He warned that Soviet 
hard-liners, eager to exploit Mikhail S. Gorbachev's unpopularity at home, may 
try to ignite a "social explosion" that could bring into play the Soviet 
Union's nuclear and chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the Soviets' current thinking, the mission of the Strategic Defense 
Initiative Organization must remain unchanged -- to kill ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Should a nation launch a ballistic missile at the United States, accidently or 
otherwise, the President has only two options: He can let it hit, then do 
nothing; or he can retaliate in kind, thereby risking full-blown nuclear war. 
Neither option should be acceptable. That is why it is essential to the 
security of the United States that the President be given a third option -- a 
fully functional and deployed strategic defense system. 
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 400 experiments have demonstrated that the United States has 
the technology to deploy such a system. The progress we have made toward this 
goal is nothing short of phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1984, using a ground-launched missile, we successfully hit a simulated 
nuclear warhead by tracking its thermal signature. The closing velocity was 
greater than 14,000 feet per second. It was like hitting a bullet with a 
bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1987, a tactical missile, traveling at three times the speed of sound, 
was intercepted in the atmosphere by a ground-launched missile. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A computer performing 1 billion operations per second can add all the 
country's Social Security numbers in one-fourth of a second. The computer we 
use can carry out 40 billion operations per second. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1988, we successfully demonstrated that a laser beam, directed at the 
casing of a ballistic missile, can destroy the missile. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An experiment is now under way to show that a ground-based laser beam can 
be relayed from a space-based mirror and hit a target a few meters in size at a 
range of 300,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Early this year, a laser-radar experiment called "Firefly" successfully 
tracked and identified, in a matter of microseconds, a re-entry vehicle decoy 
at a range of 800,000 meters. This outcome demonstrated that we can, despite 
what the critics insist, distinguish a decoy warhead from the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The most promising strategic defense system is called "Brilliant Pebbles." 
Each "pebble" is a self-contained ICBM killer, with integrated sensors, 
guidance, control and battle management. Simply put, each pebble is a small (it 
would fit on a coffee table) space-based interceptor that kills a missile by 
ramming into it at a high rate of speed. In many respects, a brilliant pebble 
is a space-based version of an air-to-air missile that is mounted on a 
radar-equipped aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
There are many more success stories, enough to put the goal of the Bush 
Administration, the Department of Defense and the Strategic Defense Initiative 
Organization well within reach -- to deploy a few thousand "Brilliant Pebbles" 
in orbit around the Earth. In peacetime, the Brilliant Pebbles would act as 
highly sensitive sensors; in the event of a ballistic-missile launch, 
accidental or not, they would, once given the command, destroy the missile in 
the boost and post-boost phases of its flight. 
</P>
<P>
We now spend more than $5 billion a year not to grow crops. The 1991 SDI budget 
request is $4.6 billion. Isn't spending money to protect ourselves, our 
children and grandchildren from the horrifying effects of a ballistic-missile 
attack a better investment?

AFTER A WEEK OFF, BUDGET NEGOTIATORS RETURN TO FACE THE MUSIC -- AND PAIN; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT: EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR THE OTHER GUY TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE ON TAXES 
AND SPENDING -- BUT TIME TO MAKE A CREDIBLE DEAL IS RUNNING OUT.

<P>
For White House and congressional leaders, trying to cut the mushrooming 
federal deficit has become like grasping for a mirage in a hot desert: The 
closer they get to the details, the tougher it looks to achieve a deal. 
</P>
<P>
As budget summiteers returned to work after a week-long recess, they repeated 
their concern that their task won't be easy. Despite the boost from President 
George Bush's new-found willingness to support "tax revenue increases," 
successful completion of the budget negotiations will require a meeting of the 
minds on issues that have undercut agreement throughout the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the President and the legislative titans craft a deal, it is far from 
certain that they will be able to force the rank and file to swallow the 
painful potion. 
</P>
<P>
"I have said all along that the most difficult part of the process is getting a 
majority of each party in the Senate and House" to vote for deficit reduction, 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said last week. Finding 
answers on each of the key components -- tax increases, domestic-spending cuts 
and defense -- will trigger opposition or criticism from many quarters. 
Democrats do not intend to "bail out" the President while he and other 
Republicans attack the medicine, added Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators, led by Office of Management and Budget Director Richard G. 
Darman and the top Senate and House leaders, have accelerated their pace. They 
have been meeting daily in a tightly packed room in the Capitol a few feet from 
the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, the summiteers want to agree on at least the outlines of a 
deficit-reduction package before the summer recess, set to start Aug. 3, for at 
least three reasons: Several more weeks will be needed to write and gain 
approval of the nitty-gritty legislative details; Congress will be hard-pressed 
to do much work before the November election; and Congress faces the need to 
make a politically painful increase in the federal debt ceiling before 
lawmakers can leave town. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators, for the most part, have not revealed their hand. But comments 
by some of the participants suggest the magnitude of their task. 
</P>
<P>
"We will need to convince members of the political risk of not doing a deal," 
said a senior Democratic aide. "The President will also have to sell the 
public. This becomes a chicken-and-egg problem." 
</P>
<P>
Because Bush convened the budget talks in May, Democrats have insisted that he 
is responsible for taking the initiative. Successful, so far, in playing a 
waiting game, the Democrats say that they will not walk out and allow Bush to 
blame them for a failure of the negotiations. But they cannot be idle players, 
if only because they control a majority in the House and Senate and they want 
to protect their previous commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the negotiators say that a serious deal must trim the deficit -- 
expected to surpass $160 billion in fiscal 1991 -- by $50 billion. During the 
next five years, they want about $500-billion cut. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, nearly half the budget savings may come from the "peace 
dividend." But even Democratic doves concede that it will be difficult to cut 
the $300-billion Pentagon budget by more than $10 billion in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all sides see the opportunity to raise at least $20 billion in new taxes 
in 1991, perhaps $120 billion over five years. But the details are tricky. In 
part, there are technical disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
Bush proposed federal user fees or asset sales among the roughly $19 billion of 
new revenues in his original budget. The Administration also assumed that 
Bush's avidly sought cut in the capital-gains-tax rate would yield the Treasury 
$5 billion next year, $2 billion more than calculated by congressional 
number-crunchers. In later years, most experts outside the Administration say 
that the capital-gains cut will reduce federal revenues by billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The bigger dispute facing budget negotiators on the revenue side is how they 
should increase taxes. Democrats, led by Mitchell and House Majority Leader 
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), lately have attacked the regressivity of the 
Reagan-era tax changes for soaking the middle-class and ladling goodies on the 
wealthy. They want to reverse that trend by, for example, raising the top 
income-tax rate from 28% to 33%. Anything less would be "completely 
unacceptable," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
But 90 of the 176 House Republicans have written Bush, warning him that "a tax 
increase is unacceptable" and that they will not vote for a budget package that 
includes one. Instead, they prefer to increase excise taxes on tobacco and 
alcoholic beverages and, perhaps, a gasoline or other energy tax. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting the domestic-spending side of the federal budget by as much as $10 
billion will be no easier. So-called discretionary programs, such as education 
or job training, were slashed during the Reagan era. Republicans say that they 
will be happy to avoid an overall increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare costs exceed $100 billion and are escalating at double-digit annual 
rates. But objections from the powerful senior-citizens lobby last year led 
Congress to repeal seemingly sensible changes that would have added Medicare 
fees to pay for a "catastrophic-illness" program. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest domestic program is Social Security, the original "hot button" 
issue. Benefit cuts are unlikely, but negotiators might settle on lowering the 
$25,000 level at which beneficiaries may be taxed. Democrats also might try to 
trim the 7.65% Social Security payroll tax. 
</P>
<P>
What happens if the budget summit fails to reach agreement this year? The 
budgeteers probably would have to raise the current 1991 deficit ceiling of $64 
billion in order to avoid massive cuts in major programs. Both parties also 
would have to consider the potentially major political implications of such a 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
Facing these perils, the negotiators have kept an optimistic public outlook. 
They may need that positive attitude to retain their own will power.

SEEKING TO RETAIN ITS BUDGET, NSA WANTS TO SPY (SHHH!) ON ALLIES; 
</P>
<P>
INTELLIGENCE: THE NSA IS READY TO STEAL COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC SECRETS FROM U.S. 
ALLIES, BUT IT SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON PROTECTING WHAT WE HAVE.

It was a typical Chamber of Commerce luncheon. The man at the podium was the 
head of the largest business in the county, possibly the state. He had come to 
impress his audience with the contribution his organization was making to the 
area. Statistics flowed faster than coffee: from the number of square feet of 
leased office space (1.5 million) to the monthly electric bill ($1.2 million) 
to the annual state taxes paid by his employees ($50 million) to the amount of 
water evaporated daily from huge air conditioners (160,000 gallons). 
</P>
<P>
Under most circumstances, such a speech would be of little interest -- but in 
this case it bordered on the extraordinary. It was a rare, candid talk to a 
small group of local business people by the federal government's official 
recluse: Vice Adm. William O. Studeman, director of the supersecret National 
Security Agency. Largest and most expensive of all the intelligence agencies, 
the NSA is responsible for eavesdropping on worldwide communications channels 
and keeping official U.S. channels secure. Now, Studeman warned, the NSA may be 
asked to begin turning its giant ear toward a new target: the economic and 
corporate affairs of our friends and allies. 
</P>
<P>
Since its birth in 1952, the nearly invisible NSA has been America's principal 
source of intelligence on the Soviet Union and the East Bloc. Currently, 
however, with the near death of communism in Eastern Europe and the 
liberalization within the Soviet Union, the NSA is facing its first major 
cutbacks since the end of the Vietnam War. In military construction alone over 
the past year, the agency has cut back by 40% -- from a projected $189 million 
to $112 million. In addition, according to Studeman, it has now begun aiming 
its antennae in new directions, such as India, Pakistan and the Philippines. 
But the most controversial new target, and one still in the discussion stage, 
is competitive economic intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike general economic intelligence, such as how much Saudi or Japanese money 
is flowing in and out of Switzerland -- something the NSA has always targeted 
-- competitive intelligence includes targeting specific foreign companies to 
secretly learn everything from new product lines to sealed bids to new 
technologies. Most of these new targets would be in friendly, allied nations or 
neutral countries. 
</P>
<P>
But just as the NSA has unique abilities to tap into the commercial secrets of 
friend and foe, it also has extraordinary techniques to protect U.S. 
communications from foreign ears. A few years ago, working with several outside 
contractors, the agency developed a reasonably priced, highly secure telephone 
system to be used in the half-million most sensitive offices in the U.S. 
government. Several contractors have developed unclassified, commercial 
versions of these phones, and they will soon be within a price range 
corporations can afford. Other techniques, such as automatic encryption of 
satellite communications, are also feasible. 
</P>
<P>
In many countries, competitive intelligence has been going on for decades. 
During much of the first half of the century, for example, the British had a 
near world monopoly over the international telegraph cable business. Since 
virtually every company had to communicate over these cables, the British took 
full advantage of the situation and eavesdropped on who was selling what to 
whom for how much. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last year, the French intelligence service, Direction General de 
la Securite Exterieure, recruited spies within such U.S. computer companies as 
IBM and Texas Instruments to gather competitive secrets for its struggling, 
largely government-owned computer firm, Compagnie des Machines Bull. The 
Japanese also have a separate intelligence unit for competitive spying and are 
known to be quite active. 
</P>
<P>
Although competitive intelligence might seem a worthwhile new target for NSA 
code breakers and eavesdroppers, the prospect is fraught with dangers. The 
chief argument in favor of turning the NSA's sensitive ear toward Sony and 
Nissan and Bull, and any number of other companies, is that other countries are 
doing it toward us. But there is no real comparison. When it comes to 
eavesdropping, the NSA has the world wired. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, many countries in Europe and the Far East have hosted U.S. 
listening posts. In the past as well as today, these platforms offer unique 
insights into Soviet as well as Chinese activities. Once the European 
Community, Japan and other countries learn that they have become the NSA's new 
key targets, future cooperation may be in great jeopardy. "My allies . . . are 
asking me lots of questions on a day-to-day basis about . . . NSA spying on our 
friends," said Studeman. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem with getting into this new form of espionage, according to 
Studeman, revolves around basic questions of law and ethics. "There are a 
substantial number of . . . legal and ethical problems associated with the 
concept of trying to provide intelligence information directly to business in 
the United States," Studeman said. "This country does not have, if you will, 
the business ethic and the arrangements that some of the other Western 
countries have that do engage in economic intelligence collection. We do not 
have a large, vertically integrated support structure in the sense that the 
Japanese have. And we certainly don't have, let's say, the structure that the 
French have in terms of the close affiliation that exists between the 
government and a lot of their major industries." 
</P>
<P>
There is also the problem of which U.S. companies should receive NSA 
intelligence. For years, the NSA has gone to great lengths to protect its 
"sources and methods" of collection. With so many major corporations now 
multinational, or with hidden offshore interests, the risks of sharing the 
sensitive secrets may cancel out any benefits. "There isn't any use to 
collecting it," said Studeman, "if it cannot be used." 
</P>
<P>
Studeman pointed out, "the area of economics is now becoming the area of 
principal concern to the American citizen . . . (and) more people are concerned 
about economic competitiveness than they are concerned about military 
problems." Nonetheless, it is questionable how many would want the Army, Navy, 
Air Force and Marines, which do most of the eavesdropping for the NSA, to spend 
their time -- and taxpayers' money -- helping General Electric steal a new idea 
or cheat on a competitive bid. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than escalate the economic espionage war by turning the NSA into a 
corporate spy, the agency and industry should work together to protect their 
secrets from foreign intelligence organizations. Just as many companies 
annually budget for security against shoplifting, embezzlement and pilferage, 
those worried about foreign eco-spies could dedicate additional resources 
toward a comprehensive communications and computer security program. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the question of whether the United States should throw its cloak 
into the circle of competitive espionage should not be decided in some 
windowless secure room, but in Congress and on newspaper Op-Ed pages. Studeman 
took a brave first step by making the debate public -- and the open debate 
should continue. Nonetheless, the spy chief was well aware of the risks. "We'll 
see how much my butt gets burned as a result," he said quietly as he was 
leaving.

With the summer sun, the wildfires have returned to the West. Sweat ran down my 
face and dripped off my nose as the radio announcer began to describe the first 
big fires of the year in Arizona and California. 
</P>
<P>
My attention switched from the papers on my desk and focused on a small color 
photograph in my office that I took 10 years ago. It's a midnight photograph of 
a firefighting crew standing on a ridge; the fire burning in the canyon below 
lends the night an apocalyptic brightness. We look like a group of people 
waiting for entry through the gates of hell. The radio announcer finished her 
story by eulogizing the firefighters who died in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
I thought about how easily it could happen to anyone facing a wildfire's wall 
of smoke, ash and flames. Firefighting has been described as long periods of 
boredom, interspersed with moments of sheer terror. Despite the development of 
one of the world's finest firefighting organizations, when the wildfires start 
to burn in California, those moments of terror can turn into hours, days or 
weeks. You recall the significant moments. The rest seem to vanish into the 
haze until a fellow firefighter reminds you of a shared experience. 
</P>
<P>
My first season as a firefighter was also my most terrifying. I remember 
chasing wildfires through subdivisions, only to be chased myself by the flames 
when the winds changed. The wind-driven fires often moved faster than our fire 
engine. One moment the streets of homes would be safe, the next, every house 
would be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, our engine was protecting a house from the advancing fire. I was 
waiting on the end of a hose line as the wind blew the heavy smoke and the heat 
of the fire straight at us. Although I couldn't see the fire through the smoke, 
I could hear it burning toward us. I couldn't even see the fire engine -- even 
though I knew it was less than 100 feet away. The hose line literally became my 
umbilical chord, my lifeline to our engine. To communicate, we sent runners up 
and down the hose line. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly alone, panic-stricken, I wanted to drop the nozzle and run, but I 
didn't know which way to go. Like an apparition, a veteran firefighter emerged 
through the smoke. His presence and steady voice reassured me. We stood our 
ground and saved the house. Then we moved on. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, I struggled to pull a hose line through brush and up a rocky hill 
to halt the advance of a wildfire through a subdivision. As I neared 
exhaustion, suddenly the hose line seemed to be floating. I looked back and saw 
homeowners had fallen in line behind us to help advance the hose. Beside us, 
neighborhood children pounced on every ember. The fire was quickly extinguished 
on that flank. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the subdivision we were not so lucky. In 30 minutes, 16 
homes were lost. Few things are more frustrating than driving up a street with 
one fire engine and finding three houses on fire. Before we could get set up, 
three more houses were aflame. All six had shake roofs or dry brush growing 
right up to their sides. Shake roofs are akin to covering a roof with kindling; 
uncleared brush close to a house the equivalent of surrounding it with Roman 
candles. 
</P>
<P>
We began concentrating on two unburned homes. There was a swimming pool next 
door, but we couldn't get close enough to use it for a water supply. One of the 
houses caught fire and the roof on the other started to smolder. We were 
running out of water. Someone shouted, "Incoming!" From above, a helicopter 
dropped a bucketful of water, quenching the flames. It dipped down, refilled 
the bucket out of the swimming pool and continued its airborne campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But down the street, the fire raged. A Eucalyptus grove caught on fire. 
Suddenly, a tree-lined street became a tunnel of flames shooting more than 100 
feet in the air. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that wasn't burning was the asphalt pavement, but it was 
shimmering under the heat waves. We moved our engine out quickly. But as we 
looked back, we saw a woman standing in the middle of the road and ran back for 
her. She was in shock, mumbling about her car. We told her not to panic and 
eased her down the street, surrounded by flames. 
</P>
<P>
The smoke and fire were getting close. Suddenly, a contractor appeared with his 
bulldozer. He was digging a foundation in the area and wanted to know if we 
could use his help. We didn't know whether to kiss him or his bulldozer. He 
agreed to cut a line through a field of brush, creating a firebreak. Desperate, 
we decided to fight fire with fire and started a backfire. Then, while we 
patrolled the fire line, we stood, awe-struck by the incredible intensity and 
destructive beauty of the two fires as they burned together. Overhead, air 
tankers and helicopters circled, ready to assist us in case our hastily 
constructed fire line was threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Our pace slowed after we stopped the fires' advance. I realized that every time 
I blinked, my eyes hurt more. In the fire engine's rear-view mirror I could see 
my eyes were almost swollen shut. I looked at the rest of our crew -- their 
eyes all looked the same. We washed the soot, ash and dirt from one another's 
eyes and, exhausted, climbed back on the engine and begin to patrol -- looking 
for hot spots and dreaming about showers, food and sleeping, after spending 36 
hours on the line. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the destruction we found one house unscathed. It was 
constructed of fire resistant materials and was surrounded by a wide band of 
fire resistant vegetation. "I don't know if I would be embarrassed or proud if 
I owned that place," a fellow firefighter said. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, you don't realize the devastating impact of a wildfire until after 
the weather settles, the fires ebb and the smoke begins to clear. Then, as 
residents are let back into the area, the horror hits. How do you help people 
who have lost everything? How do you help people who have lost generations of 
photographs, mementos and property? Next to being burned, the most horrifying 
aspect of catastrophic fires is watching home owners sift through the ashes. No 
matter how many fires, you never get used to seeing it. 
</P>
<P>
As the news report ended, I realized that I'm no longer the rookie firefighter 
I was a decade ago, when that snapshot was taken. I'm rarely overwhelmed by the 
cataclysmic nature of wildfires. I've become one of those calming voices who 
can reassure his comrades through the smoke and flames. 
</P>
<P>
Some would call me a veteran. But thinking back over the destruction I have 
seen; how helpless I have felt trying to stop those fires; remembering that two 
of the firefighters I fought wildfires with during my first season have died, I 
only feel lucky.

GOVERNMENT STING USED AGAINST WASHINGTON'S MAYOR BARRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reply to "Justice Suffers in 'Sting' of Mayor Barry," by Jesse Jackson, 
Commentary, July 8: 
</P>
<P>
After reading Jackson's column, I have several questions to ask. Who is on 
trial here, Washington Mayor Marion Barry or the government? Was there probable 
cause that Barry had used drugs and had lied about it? Jackson adroitly 
sidesteps the possibility that Barry may be mentally sick and describes him as 
"physically sick and chemically dependent." 
</P>
<P>
Should such a person head a city government? Furthermore, should the government 
go after drug lords, kingpins, etc. and not after users? Would there even be 
such people if there were no users? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if Jackson believes the government singles out black politicians for 
prosecution (which I doubt), shouldn't black politicians behave in such a way 
that their actions appear beyond reproach? Would Jackson have black politicians 
held to a lesser level of scrutiny than white politicians? Wouldn't that be the 
ultimate in patronizing?

WILL ON HONG KONG REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While he was at it, Will should have explained to the American people who 
rejoiced with the victors of the Falkland's war, the primary reason why the 
whole Armada was mobilized by the British to preserve the status quo on the 
tiny Malvinas (Falklands to the British) Islands. The issue at hand was the 
conservation of second-class citizenship for the inhabitants of the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Had Argentina claimed the islands unopposed, British would have been 
hard-pressed not to grant full citizenship to the 2,000 or so Brits living 
there who may have opted to live in England rather than Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Full citizenship, in this case, meant that the Malvinas/Falklanders would have 
the sovereign right to emigrate to England. No problem, right? Wrong! Full 
citizenship to the South Americans would have to set a precedent for the 
citizenry of Hong Kong in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
To save the integrity of their peaches-and-cream complexions hundreds of young 
men were killed and injured, to say nothing of the innocent whales who, 
mistaken for submarines, were torpedoed. 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing how cheap life becomes when in the service of warped ideals.

GOVERNMENT STING USED AGAINST WASHINGTON'S MAYOR BARRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a former journalist for The Guardian (Manchester, England) I am taken aback 
by the cheapening of traditional media standards in this country. I refer in 
particular to the nationwide publication of the Barry videotape, surely a porno 
show free to everyone including the school kiddies. 
</P>
<P>
Even The Times' editorial "Can't Do Business Without Customers" (July 2) didn't 
really need an accompanying replay picture of the mayor smoking crack in his 
shirt sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of journalism raises the question, "Isn't it in violation of the law 
when a case is before the court to allow all this public comment with 
illustrations?" 
</P>
<P>
If the FBI needs evidence to prove Barry's guilt, they've got it. They don't 
need to flaunt it and make it a press handout.

GOVERNMENT STING USED AGAINST WASHINGTON'S MAYOR BARRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The smoke-screen claims of racism and law enforcement overkill to explain the 
Mayor Barry sting are missing the main point of the government's extraordinary 
but necessary efforts to arrest Barry, who at the time of his arrest was the 
No. 1 law enforcement officer in the District of Columbia. To catch a big 
criminal fish the government's legal net has to be larger and stronger than one 
required to arrest and convict an ordinary criminal. No ordinary police officer 
could walk in and arrest Richard Nixon for conspiracy, or Michael Milken for 
fraud. The status and power of the alleged offender has to factor into the law 
enforcement effort necessary to bring the offender to justice. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the legal process for attempting to convict the criminal 
conspiracies of Richard Nixon required the entire Congress and even the Supreme 
Court. Despite all of this legal firepower Nixon eluded being convicted when 
his deal with his selected President, Gerald Ford, resulted in his 
comprehensive pardon. Former President Reagan (who no longer remembers the 
alleged criminal offenses committed within the context of the Boland 
Amendment), and President Bush because of their political positions and power 
have eluded the criminal net for their alleged crimes in the Iran-Contra mess. 
Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese through various legal maneuvers managed to 
avoid prosecution for various deviant acts he committed in his powerful 
position. It is simply more difficult to arrest and convict people in power, 
who control some of the legal machinery that is in place to deal with their 
crimes, than ordinary offenders. 
</P>
<P>
In Barry's case, it should not be forgotten, that in an earlier effort to 
apprehend him for using drugs in a hotel (a criminal act testified to by 
several witnesses), the police in Barry's police department were called off at 
the last moment. Power-status crimes require extraordinary and powerful police 
and judicial procedures for the effective administration of justice.

DON'T SEIZE ON HUMAN RIGHTS AS A BAR TO MEXICAN TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CUAUHTEMOC CARDENAS, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas ran for president of Mexico in 1988 
and lost bya 14% margin, an official tally that provoked widespread allegations 
of fraud.

<P>
Human-rights abuses are not new in Mexico, but impunity and corruption of the 
police have dramatically increased lately. This has resulted, in my view, 
largely because traditional forms of controlling the police have eroded, yet 
new democratic and accountable forms of control have not emerged. Also, there 
has been growing violence on the part of security forces who are either out of 
official control or have become deliberately transformed into a rogue machinery 
that by its very nature is beyond the reach of the law and accountable 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Human-rights violations, which include murder, torture, extortion and 
widespread intimidation, have been amply documented by Mexican organizations 
and are now finally being reported by foreign entities like Americas Watch. It 
is very hard to believe that this violence could occur without the knowledge of 
those at the top of the pyramid of Mexican authority. 
</P>
<P>
International public opinion, particularly in the United States, has been under 
the impression that Mexico is going through an ambitious program of reforms 
aimed at modernizing the economy and catching up with world political trends. 
Now, however, the world is beginning to see that economic change is not being 
accompanied by political liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
The beginning of the debate in the United States regarding a free-trade 
agreement with Mexico has coincided with this new awareness of human-rights 
abuses. However, it would be a mistake to make the situation a central issue in 
the U.S. debate on free trade; it should not be made a partisan issue, for 
example, by labor unions or particular industries with the purpose of 
preventing Mexican access to the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
Such policies will not help democracy and respect for human rights. And they 
won't work. Worst of all, they will not endear the United States to the 
millions of Mexicans who want their country to enter the 21st Century as a 
modern, democratic, competitive nation where basic human rights are protected 
-- not a country where votes count less than exports and human life less than 
ideological conformity.

It is hard to ignore the widely held perception, here and abroad, that the rule 
of law in Mexico is being drowned in blood. Reports from Americas Watch and the 
Organization of American States' human-rights subcommittee have brought into 
the limelight a sorry civil-rights record accumulated over many years. They are 
no cause for surprise within Mexico, however. Over the last few months, the 
Mexican media have been filled with allegations of human-rights violations: 
corruption, torture and other illegalities committed by police forces; an 
increasingly dirty war against the drug lords; frequent harassment and even 
assassination of human-rights advocates, opposition activists, government 
critics and press members; the use of goon squads by the ruling party's labor 
arm to stifle union dissent; a long trail of protest and violence following an 
equally long trail of fraud at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-government voices and even Americas Watch stress the traditional nature of 
such abuses, their fundamental continuity with a past in which abuses were 
ignored by the press and rarely denounced publicly. But those conditions no 
longer prevail in today's Mexico. Thus, hounded by a freer press and pressured 
by ever more vigilant public opinion, the government at first responded with a 
largely reactive policy, taking a case-by-case approach. Swamped by a growing 
number of alleged violations, that strategy has now played itself out. Only a 
few weeks ago, Salinas announced the creation of a National Commission for 
Human Rights staffed by distinguished citizens. This development, of course, 
negates the argument that violence and abuse of power are at there customary 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Who's to blame for this state of affairs? 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, we can discard the rumors, never absent from Mexican politics, 
that the presidency is directly involved in covert repression. In the case of 
the Salinas administration, such imputed motives simply don't square with the 
liberalizing orientation of its policy in economics and politics. But 
discarding the possibility of from-the-top directives does not entirely free 
the administration from blame. 
</P>
<P>
The government bears some responsibility for the prevailing Thomas Beckett 
syndrome. In the case of death threats against the leftist critic Jorge G. 
Castaneda, many fingers pointed to the press office of the presidency. While 
largely dedicated to massaging public opinion and burnishing Salinas' image, 
this office has lately engaged in negative campaigns against dissenters and 
political rivals. But in a country where intemperate remarks and candid 
opinions from leaders are interpreted by their underlings as veiled orders, a 
negative campaign orchestrated by presidential staffers is bound to be taken as 
targeting veritable enemies of the state. The president's image-handlers must 
beware of becoming hatchet men. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is that violations stem from the resistance marshalled by 
the conservative old guard in the face of rapid economic and political change 
that is steadily undermining its power and influence. For the political 
leadership class now passing from the scene, all creatures of habit instilled 
by a lifetime of authoritarianism, such resistance is tied to their unwavering 
loyalty to the old system, including the primacy of the presidency, as much as 
to their instinct for political survival. If a source of the recent troubles 
lies within the top ranks of the bureaucracy, the ruling party or its allied 
interest groups, then Salinas must be rid of it; raps on the knuckles will not 
suffice. 
</P>
<P>
A more disturbing explanation is that the central government is slowly losing 
control over its far-flung apparatus. As the decomposition of the PRI 
(Institutional Revolutionary Party) accelerates, and as the lines of command in 
the security forces short-circuit, rogue elephants may have begun to roam the 
country engaging in small-scale crime and terror. Against this, the appointment 
of blue-ribbon committees and presidential declarations in defense of human 
rights are simply not enough, since bottom-level officials no longer align 
themselves automatically with dictates from the center. What is needed is 
constant effort to identify and bring to punishment those who perpetrate crimes 
cloaked in authority. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the worst-case scenario is that we are witnessing a rising tide of 
anarchic lawlessness in the country, raising the prospect that in the not so 
distant future Mexico will be paired with Colombia, Peru, Guatemala or El 
Salvador as an example of dead-end violence. Only forthright leadership and 
stubborn political will from the top can stop this trend and set things right. 
Yet Carlos Salinas, though rightly praised for his bold leadership on the 
economic front, has proved to be sluggish on political issues. In his year and 
a half in office, he has allowed the country to drift, unable to articulate a 
political vision capable of mobilizing broad support and of drawing the forces 
of destabilization into institutional channels of pressure politics. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, Salinas has distanced himself from the political reform process 
that he pledged when he took office. He has left proposals to reform the 
electoral system and the ruling party to his lieutenants and allies in 
Congress, the bureaucracy and the PRI itself. Should the reforms turn out tepid 
and mincing, the effect on the midterm elections next year will be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
On the issues of civil rights, as difficult as the economic ones he has 
mastered, Salinas must lead, or Mexico will follow a road going nowhere fast.

BIRDWATCHERS FLOCK TO NEW JERSEY CONTEST

<TEXT>
<P>
In the World Series of Birding, people do the migrating. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to identify as many birds as possible in 24 hours, five-person teams 
came to New Jersey for a weekend in May to cough like a clapper rail and squint 
through binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
A team sponsored by Carl Zeiss Optical in Alexandria, Va., captured the seventh 
annual birdwatching title by identifying 210 birds after racing over 490 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"Stop! Please stop! Please stop the van!" shouted Julie Zickefoose, a bird 
illustrator from Hadlyme, Conn. "There's a tern hovering." 
</P>
<P>
The group identified the bird within 10 seconds and shouted: "Drive on." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have time to enjoy the bird," said Rick Radis, a writer from 
Denville, N.J., who was on the winning team. "It was: 'There's a stilt 
sandpiper. Let's get back in the car.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the New Jersey Audubon Society, the contest began at 12:01 a.m. 
and ended the following midnight. The teams frantically crisscrossed hundreds 
of miles of New Jersey from pinelands to shore marsh. 
</P>
<P>
Most started in northwestern New Jersey, relying on their ability to hear birds 
in the morning darkness. With daylight came a southward migration of 
birdwatchers, who hit the New Jersey shore tired but eager by midday. The 
competition ended on the tip of New Jersey's southern shore in Cape May, a 
haven for migratory birds on their Atlantic flyway. 
</P>
<P>
The state attracts a variety of birds because of its varying terrain of 
coastline, small mountains and pinelands. Its location between Canada and the 
southern United States also makes it possible to find birds from those areas. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny and windy afternoon -- wind hampers birdcalls -- the "birders" 
descended on the Edwin Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge in Oceanville, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The vans make their own formation by rumbling slowly along a dirt road until 
someone sights or hears a new bird species. 
</P>
<P>
Teams operate on the honor system, and all members are required to have seen or 
heard the bird for it to be marked off. Five percent of the birds do not have 
to be identified by all members. This year, 253 birds were identified by the 35 
teams. The clapper rail was heard but not seen. 
</P>
<P>
Would a birder lie? 
</P>
<P>
"It's the last of the honor sports," said Peter Alden, a tour group leader from 
New York City who has visited more than 100 countries and seen more than 5,000 
bird species. "But you could have lied through your teeth, gotten up at 11 in 
the morning and figured out what you could have seen." 
</P>
<P>
Alden and Zickefoose's group, which also included actress Jane Alexander, 
didn't seem like the lying kind. Bird identification books littered their van, 
and three hours of travel with them showed their love for mastering the coughs 
that will draw out a clapper rail and for whipping out binoculars fast enough 
to spot a snowy egret. 
</P>
<P>
The team ended up counting 168 birds, finishing 18th. 
</P>
<P>
For the weekend at least, the camaraderie disappeared between birders who 
ordinarily would gladly show another that barn owl in the refuge's 
pewter-colored waters set against the casino skyline of Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, everybody kind of laughs at the bird you didn't get," 
said Alf Wilson, co-owner of a Walpole, Mass.-based company putting out a bird 
identification video. 
</P>
<P>
Then he grew silent and cupped his ears while his teammates coughed, trying to 
attract the elusive clapper rail. 
</P>
<P>
As for the winners, they credited their victory to 500 hours of advance 
scouting and simple birders' luck at bird-spotting or "getting on the bird." 
</P>
<P>
For example, they found a red crossbill in northern New Jersey even though the 
migratory bird is not usually found in the state in spring or summer. 
</P>
<P>
And members of the winning team -- who got a team trophy and a pair of 
binoculars apiece -- said they celebrated their victory by getting a jump on 
next year's scouting. They got up early the next day and spotted a Mississippi 
kite. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for enjoyment, but it's more of a game," Radis said.

PIONEER PILOT FLEW INTO FAME, FORTUNE AND HISTORY -- WITH A NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: THE URGE TO SURVIVE NIGHT-MAIL ROUTES DROVE JEPP JEPPESEN TO DRAW HIS 
FIRST AERIAL CHART. TODAY HIS NAVIGATION MANUALS ARE USED BY ALL U.S. AIRLINES.

<P>
In 1927, Elrey (Jepp) Jeppesen borrowed $500, bought an old Army surplus JN4 
"Jenny" biplane, quit high school and went barnstorming with a flying circus. 
</P>
<P>
Within two years he had flown the first aerial surveys of then-uncharted 
Mexico. He went on to survive dangerous night-mail routes over the Rockies and 
Northwest, and he later became an airline captain into the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
But it was his air navigation charts that won him both a fortune and a place in 
the national Aviation Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Leffler, who founded the Museum of Flight at Seattle, once said the museum 
traces the history of flight from "Leonardo da Vinci to E. B. Jeppesen. . . . 
Jepp's work has saved a lot of lives. People who didn't use his charts ran into 
mountains." 
</P>
<P>
Now 83, Jeppesen, the shy son of Danish immigrants, looks back on that Golden 
Age of aviation from his home in an exclusive Cherry Hills estate area. 
</P>
<P>
"It was magical for me. I can't hardly believe it ever existed," he said. 
"Those old open airplanes -- you felt like a bird, a part of the airplane. . . 
. It was so damn much fun. You could feel the wind on your face, the wind on 
the stick and the rudder. You were part of it. Today, you just might as well 
get on a train." 
</P>
<P>
A strong sense of survival prompted Jeppesen's first chart book, a tiny 
hand-size loose-leaf ring binder. 
</P>
<P>
"My motivation was to learn the routes real fast, to try to remember all these 
things," he said of his days as a night-mail pilot. "I started writing them 
down and making sketches. We followed railroad tracks (called 'hugging the UP' 
or Union Pacific) and highways. We needed to know the size of the fields, where 
they were, obstructions" -- such as smokestacks, water towers, power lines, 
trees, mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the outhouses faced south. If your compass went out and you could find 
an outhouse, you could find out what direction you were going." 
</P>
<P>
Jeppesen's little black notebook became the granddaddy of the Jeppesen Airway 
Manual, first published in 1933. It sold for $10 and included landing-approach 
procedures for 50 airfields between Chicago and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Jeppesen confirmed his information by driving the entire distance by car, 
climbing mountains and smokestacks and water towers with altimeters strapped on 
his back. He obtained additional information from city and county engineers, 
surveyors and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Jeppesen Airway Manuals are used by all U.S. airlines, many foreign 
carriers and two-thirds of all instrument-rated pilots. 
</P>
<P>
When instrument flying was introduced during the mid-1930s, Jeppesen updated 
his black book to show pilots how to follow radio beacons, mileage reference 
charts and terrain elevation profiles. 
</P>
<P>
He believed instrument flying was the only way to develop aviation into a 
reliable form of transportation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the outbreak of World War II, I had the whole United States covered. I gave 
50 of the manuals to the military," he said, and secured contracts with both 
the Navy and Army air wings. 
</P>
<P>
His aviation navigation chart business began as a moonlighting business with 
the help of his wife, Nadine, a United Airlines stewardess he met and married 
in 1936. They worked from their basement in homes in Cheyenne, Wyo.; Salt Lake 
City and Denver as United moved Jeppesen around during his commercial pilot 
career. The Jeppesens hired college students as draftsmen and artists. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1954 in Denver, the stress of two full-time jobs became too much. 
Under doctors' orders, Jeppesen retired from commercial flying at the age of 
47. 
</P>
<P>
When he sold his Denver-based air navigation chart company in 1961, it was 
grossing $5 million a year and had more than 200 employees. Today it employs 
840 people worldwide and grosses $80 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Jeppesen launched his long aviation career as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"I never finished high school. I soloed (with just two hours and 15 minutes 
flying time) and bought this Jenny for $500 -- borrowed most of it from people 
on my paper route (in Odell, Ore.). I got in the airplane and just never got 
out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been sleeping in the hangar, gassing engines, going barnstorming with the 
older guys, doing a little wing-walking," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to take this old Jenny up to about 5,000 feet over the Columbia River 
and make long slow loops all the way down. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"The hum of the engine had a lot to do with it, the noise of the propeller -- 
it all glued together for a sensation you certainly can't enjoy today on an 
airliner," Jeppesen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I used the Jenny for barnstorming. They called it a flying circus. Two or 
three of us would get our planes and go into a town, do some stunts to attract 
the people . . . then charge them $10-$20 for a 15-minute ride." 
</P>
<P>
In 1929, he landed a job with Royal Dutch Shell Oil flying English aerial 
photographer Sidney Bonnick on a pictorial survey of then-uncharted Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
He was the 27th pilot to be licensed in Oregon, the 31st in Mexico and his 
Federation Aeronautique International pilot license is No. 7034, dated Jan. 29, 
1929, and signed by Orville Wright. 
</P>
<P>
In 1930, he began flying the night mail -- it paid twice as much as flying by 
day -- for Varney Airlines at Portland, and then joined Boeing Air Transport. 
Both companies later merged to become United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
On the mail runs in Wyoming, he remembers the wind so strong against the puny 
power of the plane that sometimes he'd be flying backward. 
</P>
<P>
Flying the mail early in the 1930s was flying by the seat of your pants, 
Jeppesen said. 
</P>
<P>
"We guided mostly on terrain features and dead reckoning. We flew anywhere from 
50 to 300 feet" above the ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to start learning fast. Anytime somebody got sick or killed, they'd say, 
'Send Jepp over there -- he's only got a suitcase and no family.' I got to fly 
a lot of runs that way." 
</P>
<P>
Four of the 18 pilots on the Oakland to Cheyenne run were killed in the winter 
of 1930. 
</P>
<P>
Flying the night mail in a cold open cockpit, with ice on the wings, "You just 
staggered along. The prop would throw ice off and it would crash against the 
fuselage like a rifle bullet. The ice would get on the wing wires and vibrate 
and snap like a gunshot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
His bright blue eyes looked far away as that era seemed to fly past his mind in 
review. 
</P>
<P>
"The most fun was barnstorming," he said. "God, I'd love to do it all again."

N. DAKOTA TOWN TEETERS ON BANKRUPTCY; 
</P>
<P>
CITIES: ONCE A PROSPEROUS OIL COMMUNITY, BELFIELD SAW A DROP IN OIL PRICES THAT 
LEFT IT IN THE LURCH.

BELFIELD, N.D. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Main Street is quiet except for a few children riding their bikes, dodging the 
many holes and bumps their town can't afford to fix. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, this community of 1,100 has been on the verge of becoming the 
first in North Dakota history to declare bankruptcy. Outside town, on the edge 
of the scenic Badlands, an oil well reminds residents of better days as well as 
Belfield's uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty much at a standstill," said George Kessel, 77, who was born and 
reared here. "Everybody's hanging on, waiting for things to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Oil field worker Driggers (Bob) Tyndall has been in town for just three weeks, 
but he has been reading and hearing about Belfield's prosperous past and 
troubled present. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was up, it was booming, it was alive," Tyndall said. "But look at it 
now -- it's dead." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, Belfield's future looked as promising as the state's oil 
industry. Oil workers poured into the unprepared town, forcing officials to 
sell $2.1 million worth of bonds in the early 1980s to pay for water, sewers 
and housing. Its population swelled by almost 300. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1986, oil prices had dropped and Belfield was stuck with more than $1 
million in unpaid property taxes owed by unemployed workers who left. 
</P>
<P>
City officials ruled out new taxes for people already complaining of 
skyrocketing costs. Instead, they hoped to work out deals with the bondholders 
that would pay off part of the debt or set up a payment plan. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the town's debt totals almost $1.9 million, and no deals are in sight. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping we could avoid bankruptcy, but as time is going by and no 
clear-cut decisions are made . . . we're going back to the idea that bankruptcy 
is going to happen," said former Mayor Phil Dolyniuk, who stepped down in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a battle. The next four years are going to be very 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Albert Hardy told bondholders in a February letter that city services 
such as water, sewer and streets were curtailed "to the point where the health 
and well-being of the people remaining in Belfield may be at risk." 
</P>
<P>
Dolyniuk said that he doesn't expect any health problems, although he noted 
that Belfield's landfill is getting full and the town may have problems paying 
to get its waste shipped elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The number of full-time municipal workers has declined from seven in 1984 to 
four today, and the town police bought a used car last time they needed one. 
The town has lost a grocery store and a car dealership, although it has gained 
a service station and a Dairy Queen. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have formed a group called the Community Development Corporation to 
give the town a moral and financial lift. 
</P>
<P>
The group and others helped raise money to repair a swimming pool that had been 
closed for years. It also put up signs along U.S. 85 to attract travelers and 
turn a small conservation dam nearby into a recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
A new 24-page brochure was written to tell business prospects about Belfield's 
history, recreation and climate. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the efforts seem to be paying off. 
</P>
<P>
Arcus Environmental Inc. last month announced plans to hire 50 people for a 
plant that turns hazardous waste into fuel. Belfield officials are wooing a 
dentist so people won't have to drive 20 miles to Dickinson to get their teeth 
fixed. 
</P>
<P>
And Mayor Susan Heck is cautiously -- very cautiously -- optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"If we maintain, I think we'll be lucky," she said. "We just take it a step at 
a time. It's gradually coming around." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody expects a big oil boom again," said Duane Indergaard, owner of 
Belfield's Ft. Houston Museum.

LAWMAKERS' LETTERS TO GO ON DISPLAY;

<P>
HISTORY: THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS WILL EXHIBIT MAIL BETWEEN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
AND THEIR SPOUSES OVER THE LAST 200 YEARS.

<P>
Forget Gary Hart and Donna Rice -- you don't always need a politician and the 
other woman to titillate the imagination. Sometimes what goes on between a 
lawmaker and his wife is just as interesting. 
</P>
<P>
And no less than the Library of Congress is offering a peep through the 
keyhole. 
</P>
<P>
From September to March, the library will display some of the most personal 
mail that ever traveled between members of Congress and their wives over the 
last 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there was sex in Washington in the nation's formative years. It's 
described by Rep. Job Pierson (D-N.Y.) to his wife, Clarissa, on Dec. 17, 1834. 
</P>
<P>
It seems Mrs. Pierson's brother, a U.S. senator, seduced a maid the first week 
of her employment and "co-habitated with her during the whole session." 
</P>
<P>
"The other boarders were angry at this monopoly," Pierson wrote. "They enticed 
some four or five girls from a house of ill-fame . . . who came there every 
night" until the landladies "ordered the servants to bar the doors against 
their admission." 
</P>
<P>
Other letters radiate laughter, sadness, courage, love, poignancy, fear and 
that old bromide that a gal stands by her man. There is only one woman -- the 
late Rep. Clare Booth Luce (R-Conn.) -- among the lawmakers featured in the 
exhibit, which is part of the library's bicentennial celebration of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The letters discuss: 
</P>
<P>
* The role of women. "Always be sunshine and flowers," Pierson counseled 
Clarissa on Feb. 12, 1833, but never worry about "the price of wheat" because 
"such matters should be provided and regulated by the other sex." 
</P>
<P>
* Spousal wit. "Mark my magnanimity," Elizabeth Woodbury wrote her Jacksonian 
Democrat husband, Sen. Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire, on Jan. 3, 1830. "I here 
invest you with a carte-blanche, to bow to, to smile upon, or to flatter any 
lady you please, without doing penance for it on paper. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
* Spousal support. "You have rendered the world the greatest service . . . you 
have used the power and opportunity . . . for humanity and democracy," Belle 
Case La Follette wrote Sen. Robert M. La Follette (R-Wis.) on March 5, 1917. It 
was the eve of America's entry into World War I and La Follette had just fought 
bitterly, under tremendous pressure, against President Woodrow Wilson's 
proposal to arm U.S. merchant ships. 
</P>
<P>
* Society ladies. Sen. Woodbury writing to Elizabeth on Dec. 19, 1829, that 
Miss Silsbee was "flat as a pancake." Mrs. Munroe resembled "the elephant -- 
her step an earthquake and her breath a storm." And Mrs. Polk? "Thin as a 
hatchet and grown almost positively ugly." 
</P>
<P>
* The congressional pay raise of 1873. It was "pushed through the Senate during 
the final night using all sorts of parliamentary tricks," according to Sen. 
Carl Schurz (R-Mo.). He wrote his wife, Margarethe, on March 5, 1873, "The 
entire operation was so shameless. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Unflattering views of Congress by those who served. "We dayly go to the Capitol 
at about eleven o'clock, do little or nothing and return at about three o'clock 
to dine," Sen. Simeon Olcott wrote wife Tryphena, back in New Hampshire, on New 
Year's Day 1802. Twenty-two years later Andrew Jackson, then a Democratic 
senator from Tennessee, wrote his wife, Rachel, "I am truly wearied with 
lounging here; doing nothing, but feeding on the public funds." 
</P>
<P>
John J. McDonough, a manuscript historian at the library, said the exhibit will 
attempt to "bring in the personal, more intimate aspect" of lawmakers' lives 
into public view. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the letters were written when members "didn't bring their wives to 
Washington," said Marvin Kranz, an American history specialist. 
</P>
<P>
As the Civil War approached on Dec. 7, 1860, Whig Rep. Justin Smith Morrill 
informed his wife, Ruth, "I am put on the great committee to save the Union but 
I do not think it can be saved and I shall on Monday decline to serve. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The war was under way when Electa Dawes wrote Rep. Henry L. Dawes of 
Massachusetts, on July 25, 1861, that "right will prevail" and "the colored man 
will have rights which will be recognized and respected." 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, on April 16, 1865, Dawes wrote his wife that he had attempted 
to call on President Abraham Lincoln two nights earlier, but "found he had gone 
to the theater." 
</P>
<P>
The news of the assassination arrived just as Dawes arrived home and he wrote, 
sadly, "I am at a funeral and the nation are mourners." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit opens Sept. 13 in the foyer of the Library of Congress in 
Washington. It will run through March 17, 1991.

GENEROUS REWARDS TO TREASURE HUNTERS HELP INDONESIA KEEP ITS ART; 
</P>
<P>
ANTIQUITIES: AN EXHIBIT TOURING THE U.S. SHOWS THE WISDOM OF A NATION'S PAYING 
MARKET VALUE FOR FINDS.

<P>
Indonesia may have a lesson to teach other countries that are rich in buried 
ancient art. 
</P>
<P>
In such places, looters often sell artifacts to private dealers rather than 
turn them over to the authorities. In Indonesia, however, the authorities 
compete with private collectors by rewarding finders generously. 
</P>
<P>
A show that opened this month at the National Gallery of Art displays many 
treasures that came to the Indonesian government because of this system. 
</P>
<P>
One of the treasures was found in a cave on the island of Java by archeologists 
helping the government survey tourist sites. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Fontein of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, who put the show together, 
described the find: " . . . inside the cave filled with stalagmites and 
stalactites, on top of a tall rock shaped like an altar, they discovered a 
large bronze vessel containing several objects, including this gold and silver 
statuette of a couple holding hands." 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists calculate that the tiny figures -- less than 5 inches high -- 
must be at least 1,000 years old. They still aren't sure who the subjects 
represented, probably the Hindu god Shiva and his consort, Parvati. 
</P>
<P>
Both are naked from the waist up. Their heads are surrounded by halos and 
protected by little golden parasols. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sculpture of Indonesia" exhibit, in Washington through Nov. 4, will also 
travel to Houston, New York and San Francisco. Many of its best items were 
found by chance. 
</P>
<P>
A much bigger Shiva -- more than 42 inches high -- in gold, bronze and silver 
and with four arms and three eyes, was found in 1933 by farmers bathing in the 
Kali Wadas River. 
</P>
<P>
Fontein has counted 854 separate finds, some of which include several objects. 
They were reported to Dutch authorities before Indonesia became independent, 
and since then to the Indonesian government and other official bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tendency to report them because of the fair way the authorities 
reward the finders," he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
In many parts of the world finders get more by selling their treasures secretly 
than they would if they reported them. That enrages museums and archeologists 
because thieves and amateurs often destroy much of the evidence, sometimes 
unwittingly. 
</P>
<P>
Fontein told of a boy working in an Indonesian garden last year who found a 
gold neckpiece that weighed more than 3 1/2 pounds. He said the authorities 
paid the full market price of the gold and divided it between the boy and owner 
of the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy's education is assured," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Fontein was allowed to see the neckpiece on condition that he did not ask for 
it to be sent to the exhibition. An attempt will be made to film it for a 
production linked with an 18-month celebration of Indonesian culture that is to 
open here in September. 
</P>
<P>
J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery, said the exhibit opened 
before September because so many people visit Washington in summer. 
</P>
<P>
Fontein said he did not know why so many objects were buried. Many of them were 
found close to the surface. One farmer found a temple bell in a field when 
planting a new kind of sugar cane required him to plow a few centimeters 
deeper. Near it was a box with a chain from which the bell had been hung. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think they buried them just for us to find," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Faithful Buddhists and Hindus buried many things when Indonesia was invaded by 
Muslims 400 years ago. The Muslims disapproved of human images and 
representations of living things and objects connected with other religions. 
</P>
<P>
Buddhists and Hindus took refuge in the hills of Java. The final object in the 
show is a three-panel sculpture, apparently of Hindu origin. It is more than 5 
feet high and 7 feet long and shows a scene in a blacksmith's shop. On one side 
is the smith forging a sword. On the other is a man working a bellows to heat 
the forge. 
</P>
<P>
In the center panel is a fat man with the head of an elephant, naked and 
dancing. He is wearing a priest's headdress and holding a small dog in one 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
What is he doing there? That story is lost.

TRINIDAD REELING FROM ECONOMIC WOES, BRAIN DRAIN

<P>
The health service of Trinidad and Tobago has sunk into a crisis so severe that 
nurses wrap newborns in brown packing paper and hospital patients complain 
about cockroaches in their beds. 
</P>
<P>
The health crisis is part of a general malaise whose symptoms include high 
unemployment, a sharply reduced standard of living and a steady drain of 
skilled citizens who seek a better life abroad. 
</P>
<P>
After months of quiet complaints about steadily deteriorating conditions in the 
country's state-run hospitals, hundreds of nurses took to the streets in 
demonstrations that left no doubt that Trinidad and Tobago is going though 
tough times. 
</P>
<P>
Only a decade ago, the twin-island republic of 1.3 million people was the 
affluent jewel of the West Indies, with a per-capita income higher than that of 
any other island in the Caribbean chain. 
</P>
<P>
The nurses' grievances range from poor pay to the absence of even the most 
basic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
As street protests gathered momentum in June, medical staff of one of the 
country's biggest hospitals, in the city of San Fernando, ran out of baby 
blankets and started wrapping newborn infants in brown packing paper. 
</P>
<P>
Patients at another hospital, at Point Fortin, told reporters that cockroaches 
and ants were routinely marching across their beds. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, hospital staff told of surgery by flashlight, urine-soaked 
mattresses, patients being asked to bring their own sheets and provide their 
own medicines. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no syringes. There are not enough beds, there are no bedpans, few 
wheelchairs and not enough hospital trolleys," said Dr. Kenrick Rennie, head of 
the Public Services Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to imagine for people in the industrialized world but some of 
our hospitals don't even have gauze." 
</P>
<P>
At the height of street protests in the capital, hundreds of nurses converged 
on the "Red House," the ornate Parliament building in Port of Spain, waving 
placards and chanting slogans demanding the immediate resignation of health 
minister Emanuel Hosein. 
</P>
<P>
In San Fernando, workers from other trade unions joined the nurses, represented 
by the PSA, in one of Trinidad and Tobago's biggest anti-government 
demonstrations in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Hosein promised action to tackle the crisis and blamed the problems of the 
health sector on the previous government that had run Trinidad and Tobago 
during the oil bonanza that turned the country into the richest in the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came (to power), there was not a cent in the kitty," Hosein told 
Parliament as nurses outside demanded his removal. "We have the mandate but no 
money." 
</P>
<P>
The present government, led by Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson, won a landslide 
victory in 1986 elections, taking 33 out of 36 seats in the House of 
Representatives and ending 30 years of uninterrupted rule by the People's 
National Movement. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here say many of the problems faced by Robinson, including the health 
crisis, are typical of countries whose economies depend chiefly on oil. 
</P>
<P>
The oil boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s brought wealth and economic 
growth rates of 7% a year to Trinidad and Tobago. But since the collapse of oil 
prices in 1982, the one-legged economy has been in deep trouble. Government 
figures put unemployment at 23% and gross domestic product plunged from $6,856 
per capita in 1982 to $3,043 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
To halt the decline, the Robinson Administration launched an ambitious program 
to lessen dependence on oil, attract foreign investors, and cut government 
spending in line with the standard prescriptions of the International Monetary 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The government, Trinidad and Tobago's biggest employer, introduced a 10% 
across-the-board wage cut and a 15% value-added tax, which cuts sharply into 
personal incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Some 15,000 civil servants are being offered voluntary retirement under a 
rationalization program. So far, there have been few takers. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the austerity package has been mixed. There has been praise from 
free-market advocates in Trinidad and the United States, the twin-islands' 
biggest trade partner. There has been condemnation from the opposition and 
labor unions who say there are no signs of progress. 
</P>
<P>
The government disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect a return to economic growth this year for the first time since 
1983," said Bhoendradatt Tewarie, the minister of industry, enterprise and 
tourism. "We are hoping for 1% growth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is possible that we will have only 0.5." 
</P>
<P>
According to a Central Bank report issued early in July, real gross domestic 
product in the first quarter of 1990 was 0.6% below the 1989 figure.

A radio talk-show host was suspended indefinitely for banning black callers 
after a colleague's car was broken into. He later apologized on the air for his 
"emotional, spur-of-the-moment decision." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Lennox, host of a live, weekday show on WERC-AM, refused to allow black 
callers Wednesday and was suspended Thursday by the station's general manager, 
who let him back on the air briefly to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to sincerely apologize to anyone who was offended by my actions," 
Lennox told his listeners. "Anybody who has listened to my show for 14 years is 
aware of my liberal outlook." 
</P>
<P>
Lennox, 40, who is white, said he had been upset because a black man broke into 
a station employee's car and stole her purse Wednesday, just before the start 
of his two-hour show. 
</P>
<P>
Lennox he "made an emotional spur-of-the-moment decision to accept only calls 
from white listeners." 
</P>
<P>
The general manager, Berkley Fraser, also apologized on the air Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser said he didn't know how long Lennox would be suspended. "It will give us 
at least the weekend to sit down and calm down and see what the emotion was 
that got him off on that tangent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lennox said he was proud to have been part of the first integrated talk show in 
Birmingham some years back. 
</P>
<P>
"None of that excuses yesterday's show, but it might provide some perspective 
for what happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser said the station encourages free expression with live programming and 
"unfortunately, mistakes do occur." 
</P>
<P>
Callers during the Wednesday show talked about their experiences as crime 
victims and how to prevent becoming a victim. But nearly half were critical of 
Lennox for banning blacks, the Birmingham Post-Herald said. 
</P>
<P>
About 60% of Birmingham's 284,000 residents are black and about 40% are white.

PIER PRESSURE; 
</P>
<P>
LIFEGUARDS: LEAPING 40 FEET FROM AN OCEANSIDE LANDMARK, THEN SWIMMING AROUND 
IT, IS A TIME-HONORED TRADITION AND TEST OF FITNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two lean Oceanside lifeguards were delicately poised atop the citypier's narrow 
railing, ready to jump into the churning water nearly 40 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
An instant before they leaped, a fisherman suddenly dumped a whole bucket of 
fish guts and blood into the briny, and Matt Stephens and Tom Buckner found 
themselves following the slop down, dropping like two lead ingots. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disgusting, I'll tell you that," Stephens muttered moments later. 
</P>
<P>
Just another day in a time-honored tradition for Oceanside lifeguards who, 
since the '50s, have made swimming around the 1,900-foot-long pier and 
practice-jumping from the railing a ritual of skill. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, it is part of lifeguard bonhomie, a splashy yet challenging way 
to shed stress and stay toned for the deceptively strenuous job of saving lives 
when seconds matter. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the last four years, the jutting pier also has become the centerpiece 
of a killer workout for city lifeguards who must be able to run one mile, slosh 
quickly around the pier, then run another mile, all in less than 27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The architect of this regimen is Stephens, the 30-year-old lifeguard captain 
who wanted a to make sure that his force of 33 lifeguards never gets too 
blubbered out to make a dashing rescue and have wind left to spare. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps you young, you're down here with 16 year olds, competing against 
them," said Stephens. "It feels good to beat them on workouts." 
</P>
<P>
He and Buckner, at 31, are the old men among the lifeguards whose average age 
is 23. 
</P>
<P>
These two veteran lifeguards probably pack more exertion into 27 minutes than 
the average American male gets in a month, and, as their reward, Stephens and 
Buckner have not a trace of beer bellies and are untouched by the natural law 
of sagging flesh. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, the bucket of fish guts aside, the swim around the pier is a 
70-degree milk run, and the two emerge from the sea not even breathing hard. 
"To us, that's just refreshing," said Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
But it's rarely care free. 
</P>
<P>
The water is fickle, sometimes so cold in the low 50s that many a young 
lifeguard has come out shivering, the chest heaving so hard that lunch has been 
unceremoniously lost on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
That's not the only peril to keeping one's food down, and, Bucker said, "if 
it's windy and choppy, it gets tough. You have to watch your breathing. If 
there's chop, you get a mouthful of salt water." 
</P>
<P>
Hidden demons of the deep, both large and small, occupy a lifeguard's 
imagination as he gracefully strokes out and back, trying to concentrate on 
making the trip in 12 to 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards worry about getting a face full of jelly fish or startling a 
stingray, with their poisonous, pencil-sized barbs. 
</P>
<P>
But the last thing Stephens and Buckner ever want to see up close is a shark. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, sharks. It's always in the back of your mind," said Stephens, his quiet 
tone hinting at real fear. 
</P>
<P>
Buckner, with one of his puckish observations, added, "Right after 'Jaws' came 
out, they caught two of 'em." Not exactly what Stephens cared to hear. 
</P>
<P>
Visions of unlikely dorsal fins and a big mouth full of crooked teeth seem to 
concern the two men more than dropping themselves off the pier with such force 
that they plunge 10 feet under the water. 
</P>
<P>
Buckner drolly calls this feat "semi-exciting," but concedes that, after so 
many times, "the jump's a piece of cake." 
</P>
<P>
Leaping from the rail has little to do with braggadocio and everything to do 
with practicing to rescue people who run into trouble near or below the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Stephens dropped into the ocean when an off-course sailboat drifted into 
the pilings and snagged, endangering the boat's inexperienced occupants. 
</P>
<P>
Some lifeguards circumnavigate the pier every day, providing an entertaining 
show to the tourists and fishermen who watch in awe. 
</P>
<P>
Stephane Borgnine, a waitress at a restaurant on the pier, sees the spectators 
following the swimmers, who are alone or in groups, with their precision 
movement along the glassy, green water. 
</P>
<P>
"People watch, they're fascinated," said Borgnine, who is commonly called upon 
to explain that the swimmers are training lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Duncan, the city's aquatics superintendent, is the generational link 
between Stephens and Buckner and an earlier age of the lifeguard service, which 
began in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
As a young lifeguard back in the early '60s, Duncan learned to respect the 
challenge of negotiating the waters at the pier, which is 1,900 feet long, 
about 1,600 feet of that actually suspended over the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"The average person could not swim around the pier," he said, warning all but 
the best swimmers not to attempt the course. "For a lifeguard, it's an enduring 
swim, but not an extraordinary feat." 
</P>
<P>
He called the lifeguards' run-swim-run drill, "a grueling test." 
</P>
<P>
With lives at stake, that's exactly how Stephens wants it, and he will 
understand but won't tolerate a lifeguard who is timid about taking that long 
jump from the pier. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are afraid don't come back the next year, they find another 
job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The marks of his 13 years of experience are visible on his feet, scarred and 
calloused from wearing fins. 
</P>
<P>
The fins, like the rigors of practice, are with a single objective in mind: 
saving people. 
</P>
<P>
In their time, Stephens and Buckner have lost count of how many people they 
have pulled from the rip tides and the crashing surf off Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"You stop counting," Stephens said, then, after a pause, added, "It's up there, 
probably close to 1,000, maybe more." 
</P>
<P>
A key to saving lives is that lifeguards usually know precious minutes ahead 
that a neophyte, white-skinned swimmer is about to get in danger. 
</P>
<P>
By the time a swimmer is flailing around and getting dunked, a lifeguard is 
already racing down the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The tip-off to trouble is watching as swimmers blithely drift toward the places 
where lifeguards know a rip tide is waiting to carry a person out to the deeper 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way they're going to know what the rip tide is about or how to get 
out of it," said Buckner. 
</P>
<P>
He, like the other lifeguards, has pulled off some bold rescues that left him 
shaken afterward as he wondered how he managed to avoid getting pounded into 
the pier's pilings or onto the big rocks up by the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
At his age, Buckner is pleased to be in top condition and is envied by the 
younger lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
"Two of the younger guys said 'you amaze me, Tom,' " he said. He shrugged and 
added, half facetiously, "I amaze myself." 
</P>
<P>
The years flow by for a lifeguard, and Buckner, who contrary to the stereotype 
of a bronzed, bikini-crazy beach bum, has a masters degree in business 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
He figures it's almost time to hang up his fins. 
</P>
<P>
But, Stephens said, "I don't know, I think Tom will be a lifer." For himself, 
Stephens added, "I could do this until I retire."

HARD-LUCK LIFE IN HOBO JUNGLE; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: AS MANY AS 100 MEN AND WOMEN FIND SHELTER IN SHANTIES IN THE VENTURA 
RIVERBED. THEY WERE ANGERED TO LEARN THAT AN ACCUSED CHILD MOLESTER LIVED IN 
THEIR MIDST FOR A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The men and women who live in a makeshift camp along the Ventura River bottom 
known as Hobo Jungle are worried that the arrest of an accused child molester 
living among them has given their homeless community a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the river-bottom camp say they were surprised and outraged when they 
learned that Don Ray Moore, a 56-year-old fugitive wanted on 21 felony counts 
of child molesting, had been hiding out in their midst for almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
"If we ever find another child molester in Hobo Jungle he'll have to dig his 
own grave," said an eight-year resident called Silver because of the color of 
his hair. "It brings the heat down here, and they start asking questions." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura police do not believe other fugitives are hiding from the law among the 
tents and bamboo huts along the river bottom northwest of Main Street, they 
said last week. Men wanted for petty theft and public drunkenness, yes. 
Hardened criminals, not likely. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates describe the people of Hobo Jungle as desperate drifters, 
men and women who have fallen out of luck. Many drink too much. Some sleep off 
their hangovers in the afternoon. Others collect recyclable cans for petty cash 
or panhandle shoppers in town. But most do not commit dangerous crimes, 
authorities agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this guy was the exception," said Lt. Art Farrar, who heads the 
Ventura Police Department's patrol division. "We're dealing with a lot of 
marginal . . . people that have been displaced by society. I don't think we're 
dealing with wanted fugitives." 
</P>
<P>
The area many Ventura residents call Hobo Jungle is actually known by the 
homeless themselves simply as the river bottom. It is about half a mile from 
the site of an earlier Hobo Jungle that was part of the town's history during 
the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
Before World War II, men down on their luck would jump off the train as it 
slowed into Ventura, pitching tents for the night among the lush vines and 
trees of Seaside Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
The park, a city preserve, allows no campers today, said Jeff Price, chief 
ranger with the state Department of Parks and Recreation, which helps patrol 
and protect the area. 
</P>
<P>
Now the homeless live under the Main Street bridge and beyond in the river 
bottom parallel to Peking Street. Ventura residents, however, still casually 
use the phrase Hobo Jungle to mark the general location. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless camp is hard to spot at first. While broken crates and empty beer 
bottles litter the area, most of the actual dwelling places are hidden in 
clumps of brush. On a recent morning, as the camp slowly awakened, one couple 
dragged themselves off a mattress after dawn to take two bags stuffed with 
recyclable cans up to town for change. 
</P>
<P>
Marcy Canuet, 37, a former professional housekeeper from Connecticut, poked at 
her husband, Leon, and said he had been up until 3 a.m. combing the beaches for 
abandoned cans. She apologized for her makeshift home, which the couple moved 
into from another Hobo Jungle site only two days before. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not done yet," she said. "We have to get a table and stuff. I want to get 
a table and put it over there." The four corners of her house are tent poles 
covered with tarp. A ripped mattress covers half the floor area. Dirty pots sit 
by the remains of a campfire, and a blue dress hangs from a rope tied between a 
pole and a tree. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better than being up there in an alley," she said. "You can smoke down 
here. You can smoke cigarettes, drink wine. You live in a shelter, you have to 
be in bed by 9 and up by 6." 
</P>
<P>
Police officers rarely hassle them in their territory, she said. "They want us 
down here," she said. "They don't want us up there." 
</P>
<P>
Plainclothes and uniformed officers patrol the area "regularly" in cars, on 
foot and by bicycle, Lt. Farrar said, "in proportion to calls for service." 
Calls for service, however, are rare, and arrests in the area have been low. 
</P>
<P>
Crime and arrest reports for the police district that includes the river bottom 
show nine of 112 arrests were made in the Hobo Jungle area since January. From 
January to December, 1989, 15 arrests were made in the river bottom. Many were 
for public drunkenness, said Revis Robinson, supervisor of the Ventura Police 
Department's crime analysis unit. 
</P>
<P>
"We arrest a lot more drunk people coming out of bars than we probably do in 
Hobo Jungle just because we don't get complaints from people in Hobo Jungle," 
Robinson said. "I don't know if there's really more crime down there." 
</P>
<P>
The people who live in the river bottom violate no city ordinances with their 
structures, said Carol Green, a spokeswoman for the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
State, city and county officials are not quite sure how much acreage is 
occupied by the pitched tents and lawn chairs, but many place the number of 
people living there above 100. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, how many ants are in an anthill," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the number, several people in the riverbed said they regard 
themselves as family and resented learning that Moore was wanted as an alleged 
child molester. 
</P>
<P>
In Silver's camp Thursday morning a small group joined the 46-year-old 
Washington native and his wife, Sharon Foster, whom they call Ma, on the torn 
chairs and a couch gathered in a circle near their tent. A three-foot-high wall 
of dusty green wine bottles framed one corner of their camp. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably all running away from something," said 39-year-old Butch 
Ranquist. "But we're not down here to hurt people." 
</P>
<P>
Foster nodded. "One bad apple makes the whole bunch look bad." 
</P>
<P>
The homeless range from families in financial trouble to the mentally ill to 
those who choose to drift as a way of life. Many of the river-bottom residents 
seem to be drifters, said Sue Sturtevant, business director for Project 
Understanding, an organization that helps feed and shower the homeless. 
</P>

"If you didn't have anywhere else to go it doesn't sound that bad," Sturtevant 
said. "I think I'd rather be in this riverbed then on whatever street it is in 
Los Angeles where all the drugs are. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't rained in so long, so there's no water in the river. And the price 
is right." 
</P>
<P>
River-bottom dwellers say the Jungle affords them anonymity, privacy and the 
freedom to drink and to come and go as they please. A minister comes to recite 
prayers on Tuesdays, and last summer many residents attended a couple's 
riverbed wedding reception. 
</P>
<P>
Several men have dug holes for shelter under the Main Street bridge. They are 
affectionately called trolls by those in the riverbed. Into a space about as 
large as a pick-up truck bed, Clyde Simkins, 61, has hauled two ragged sofas 
and a bed. Discarded shelves line his walls, and the remnants of a shopping 
cart make a door for his dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that there are elaborate camps down there . . . is a positive 
testimony to human spirit," said Nancy Nazario, homeless ombudsman for the 
county Public Social Services Agency. "People tend to like a territory that 
they can have an illusion of control over. I don't know what homelessness in 
this county would look like if we didn't have it." 
</P>
<P>
Nazario, who reports the county's total homeless population at about 2,000, 
said the river bottom has a bigger proportion of single homeless, many with 
alcohol abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, a few men roused Silver from bed and handed him a can of 
beer. Between sips he twisted his graying beard and eventually pulled a pack of 
cigarettes from his pocket to toss among the group. The men and few women 
chided one another about their habits and their pasts. 
</P>
<P>
"We take care of each other and that's more than the people up town do," Foster 
said. "They've got their houses and their money, and they don't care about each 
other."

4 WHO CLAIM POLICE BEAT THEM WERE NOT CHARGED; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE SAYS IT IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR THE DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE NOT TO PROSECUTE SUSPECTS ACCUSED OF CRIMES BY POLICE. 
</P>

<P>
Over the past two years, the Ventura County district attorney's office in four 
separate incidents has declined to prosecute suspects who contended that they 
were victims of police brutality while being arrested for various offenses by 
Oxnard officers, records show. 
</P>
<P>
In a fifth and more recent incident, the district attorney's office declined to 
file a charge of assaulting an officer against an Oxnard man who says he and 
several other guests at a June 15 private party were beaten by Oxnard police. 
Instead, Anthony Flores, 22, was charged with five misdemeanor counts of 
resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality 
lawsuits against the city, the department or the police officers involved. The 
suits, which seek unspecified damages and medical and legal expenses, are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the incidents have led to an investigation by the Police Department's 
internal affairs division. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Brodie, misdemeanor supervisor for the office, said 
the decisions not to prosecute the suspects do not necessarily mean that Oxnard 
police were not justified in making the arrests. In each of the four cases, 
Brodie said, his office did not prosecute because it found that police did not 
provide enough evidence to prove the charges "beyond a reasonable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
But Jean Farley, a supervisor for the Ventura County public defender's office, 
said it is extremely rare for the district attorney's office not to prosecute a 
suspect who is accused by police. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office may have declined to prosecute the suspects 
because police brutality has been alleged, she said. Prosecution is usually 
turned down when the arresting officer is suspected of using excessive force, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Police Chief William Kady declined to discuss the brutality 
allegations against the Oxnard officers because of pending litigation. He said, 
however, that the decisions by the district attorney's office not to prosecute 
the suspects do not reflect poorly on the department. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our reputation is any worse than any other department's," he 
said. "There is always going to be a disagreement over how much force is used." 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident involving an accusation of police brutality stemmed from 
the June 15 clash between 18 officers and about 12 party guests at a house in 
the 1300 block of South E Street. 
</P>
<P>
It began when four officers answered complaints about a loud party. A police 
report said Flores started the fight by shoving a policeman. Flores and his 
brothers, Alex, 19, and Luis Jr., 24 -- all of whom suffered gashes and scrapes 
on their heads and bodies -- said the officers beat them without provocation. 
</P>
<P>
Police had arrested Flores on suspicion of assaulting an officer and of 
resisting arrest but the district attorney's office decided two weeks later to 
prosecute Flores on the five misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"Based upon my review of all the reports, the charges were the most appropriate 
charges to file," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald Gran, who declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Robert Owens has ordered an investigation into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
In an incident April 7, Sergio E. Gonzalez, 19, accused Oxnard officers of 
ordering a police dog to attack him before he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed June 29, Gonzalez said he was standing on Sunkist Circle when 
the dog attacked him, biting him on the arm and left shoulder. Gonzalez was 
taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center, where he underwent surgery and 
spent two weeks recovering from his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Edward M. Fox, an attorney representing Gonzalez, said his client, a gardener, 
might suffer some permanent injury to his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police report filed by Officer Michael Cole, police were sent to 
a parking lot outside the Oxnard Moose Lodge to investigate a report of an 
altercation between several men after a wedding reception. Cole's report said 
Gonzalez was found hiding in the parking lot and "was bit by a police service 
dog during the arrest." 
</P>
<P>
The report, however, does not say why the dog attacked Gonzalez or whether 
Gonzalez resisted arrest. Police arrested Gonzalez on suspicion of disturbing 
the peace, Brodie said. But the district attorney's office declined to file any 
charges because the police report failed to show that Gonzalez was involved in 
the altercation, Brodie said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox said Gonzalez did not attend the wedding but was visiting a friend nearby 
and went to the parking lot to find out what was causing the commotion. 
</P>
<P>
In a third incident, Louis M. Cornett, a retired teacher and licensed gun 
dealer, said he was beaten on Oct. 20 while in custody at Oxnard police 
headquarters. Cornett said the altercation began as he was returning home after 
scouting out a site for quail hunting near Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Robert Camarillo said in a police report that Cornett was arrested in 
the 3600 block of Taffrail Road on suspicion of brandishing a weapon, resisting 
arrest and possessing a loaded firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo said in the report that he stopped Cornett while investigating a 
complaint of a man waving a gun from a car and threatening youngsters packed 
into another vehicle. Camarillo said Cornett fit the description of the man who 
allegedly brandished the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
When he searched Cornett's car, Camarillo said, he found a semiautomatic 
handgun, several rounds of ammunition and a 12-gauge shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo admitted that he later shoved Cornett against a wall at police 
headquarters because the suspect had struggled and had clenched his fists in a 
threatening manner. 
</P>
<P>
But a lawsuit against Camarillo filed May 8, 1989, alleges that while in 
custody at the police station, Camarillo shoved and punched Cornett in the 
mouth. "He slammed me in the mouth once, twice and a third time," Cornett said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Cornett, maintaining that he never struggled with the officer, said he suffered 
a broken tooth and a cut lip during the beating. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office declined to file charges against Cornett 
because, Brodie said, there was insufficient evidence to prove that Cornett 
brandished a gun. 
</P>
<P>
In a fourth incident, Alejandro Guzman-Flores, 21, accused three Oxnard 
officers of beating him on his face, causing severe damage to his eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman-Flores said he was working in a motorcycle repair shop on Jan. 27, 1989, 
when his boss asked him to investigate a noise in the alley behind the shop in 
the 1500 block of South Pine Street. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed against the city Nov. 14, 1989, the Police Department and 
officers Jana Younger, Fred Sedillos and James Struck, Guzman-Flores contends 
that he was grabbed from behind by Younger while in the alley. The officer 
poked him with a baton and questioned him about a car parked nearby, 
Guzman-Flores said in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department declined to release Flores' arrest report because, police 
officials said, it contains his criminal history. But Flores' lawyer, Sherrie 
L. McCracken, said the report states that officers were at the shop responding 
to a complaint of a man with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
McCracken said the officers continued to question Flores in English, but Flores 
-- a recent immigrant from Mexico who speaks only Spanish -- could not respond. 
Flores was handcuffed and shoved to the ground, causing Sedillos to trip and 
fall on him, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Sedillos got up and punched and kicked Flores several times while Younger held 
Flores in a "choke-hold," the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Flores was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest and obstructing an 
officer. The district attorney's office decided to prosecute Flores but later 
dismissed all charges during Flores' trial because police failed to turn over a 
recording of a dispatcher's call requesting that officers investigate the 
incident at the motorcycle shop, McCracken said. 
</P>
<P>
McCracken said Flores never struggled with the officers until after he was 
placed in the choke-hold. McCracken said Flores was beaten so severely that he 
suffered a detached retina and might lose partial sight in one eye. 
</P>
<P>
"They essentially beat the hell out of him for nothing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident, Luis C. Luna, 50, alleges in a complaint filed with the 
city on June 27, 1989, that he was beaten by three officers near a restaurant 
in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
Luna said in an interview that he, his wife and several friends were leaving 
the restaurant on July 16, 1988, when an Oxnard police car pulled up in front 
of the group. Luna, a public works inspector for the city of Port Hueneme, said 
he walked up to the police car and asked Officer Peter Ruggiero "in a kidding 
manner" what he was doing in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer jumped out and started pushing me back against the pillar in front 
of the building, using his baton on my throat," Luna said in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
When he asked the officer why he was being shoved, Ruggiero told him that he 
was under arrest, according to the complaint. Officers Steven Vendt and 
Humberto Jimenez were called to assist Ruggiero, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
"They used forcible brutality by hitting me with the baton on my elbow, knees 
and back, forcing me to drop down on the sidewalk with my face slammed against 
the pavement," Luna said in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Luna was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct under the influence of 
drugs. The district attorney's office decided to prosecute Luna, but in 
September, 1988 -- before his trial began -- all charges against him were 
withdrawn for lack of evidence, Brodie said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens ordered the department's internal affairs division to investigate Luna's 
complaint. But Luna said the Police Department later sent him a letter saying 
the investigation revealed no wrongdoing on the officers' parts. 
</P>
<P>
Luna had asked the city for $50,000 for medical expenses and to compensate for 
"humiliation suffered in public." He failed, however, to submit the claim for 
damages during the statutory six-month period after the incident and was barred 
by law from filing a lawsuit.

IT'S FEAR, FRENZY WHEN FIRE HITS HOME; 
</P>
<P>
TERROR: THE CALAMITY OF A BRUSH FIRE IS MAGNIFIED WHEN IT THREATENS YOUR HOME, 
NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By CHRISTINE MERRIN KOPP, Christine Merrin Kopp lives in Encinitas.

<TEXT>
<P>
Living in San Diego County, we all are aware of the warning signs: hot Santa 
Ana winds blowing in from the desert; brittle, dry shrubs covering the 
hillsides. We know it will happen. Then, as if our collective fears spring to 
life, we see the tell-tale black smoke that signals the onset of fire. 
</P>
<P>
But fire never breaks out near us, never in our neighborhood, right? I wonder 
if that's what people in Santa Barbara thought before last month. 
</P>
<P>
I'm living proof that life- and property-threatening brush fires do happen. 
I've been through three of them. You would think I'd be ready for the shock and 
fear by now, but I guess some lessons are harder to learn than others. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon last January, I saw the black smoke over the rooftops as I drove 
on El Camino Real to my home in Encinitas. The smoke was coming from a fire in 
the open field behind my home, about a quarter-mile away. The wind was blowing 
it away from my house so, aside from the excitement it created, the fire wasn't 
much cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I got home, however, my smugness was giving way to panic. The wind 
had changed direction, driving the flames toward my house. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was closing in on stables just beyond the creek behind our back yard. 
Neighbors were starting to come out of their homes, staring, half in shock, 
half in disbelief, as the smoke grew darker and more dense. 
</P>
<P>
I ran out, grabbed the garden hose and began to water down the wood fence and 
patio cover. My throat was dry and I started to cough. I undid the scarf that 
was holding my hair back and covered my mouth, tying it behind my head, outlaw 
style. I looked out beyond the creek and could no longer see the stables 
clearly because the smoke was so thick. Why weren't the horses spooked?, I 
remember wondering. Where were the fire trucks? Why weren't the firefighters 
coming over to this side of the creek? Why was it so quiet? 
</P>
<P>
As if to answer, a malevolent gust of wind seemed to whip the smoke into a 
whirl of energy. I've never seen a tornado, but I imagine it is not unlike this 
funnel cloud of swirling ash and soot. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly the blast of sirens jolted me into the realization that, for the third 
time in my life, I might have to evacuate. My children were at a friend's house 
and my husband was at work. It was up to me. I would have to pick and choose 
which pieces of our lives would be saved or forever lost. Whatever shred of 
rational thought I had clung to was lost to utter despair. 
</P>
<P>
Tears streamed down my cheeks as I ran inside and then upstairs. I rushed from 
bedroom to bedroom in panic and confusion, grabbing whatever I saw first: 
Brian's baseball cards, Kimberly's black patent leather shoes, my husband 
Philip's coaching trophies, even the book I was reading. I don't know why I 
picked those things. I knew there were other things I should get out, but I 
couldn't think clearly. 
</P>
<P>
I threw what I collected over the banister and went back for more, all the time 
wondering, What would they want me to take? Which clothes? Which toys? Which 
books or tapes? Which artwork? Which family heirlooms? 
</P>
<P>
Why hadn't I ever asked what was important to them? It would have been so easy 
to ask last month, last week or even yesterday. Then I would have known what to 
take. If only I had. 
</P>
<P>
I collapsed at the top of the stairs, watched the smoke billow in through the 
open sliders, listened to the sirens, surveyed my house, and cried. 
</P>
<P>
Now I know how my mother felt in 1962, when the Bel Air fire roared through our 
Los Angeles neighborhood for four days, leaving hundreds homeless. 
</P>
<P>
I recalled how my Mom, trying to disguise the fear in her voice, asked me to 
find Trudy, our dachshund, and get into the car. I watched my dad, garden hose 
in hand, climb onto the roof as we drove away. Dad stayed to save our house. 
Mom and I lost all contact with him for the rest of the day and night, not 
knowing whether he had been injured or our home had been spared. 
</P>
<P>
That blaze started in accumulated refuse at a building site. In 1976, I 
survived yet another brush fire, this one started by two boys playing with 
matches in a park near the parochial school where I taught in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The intense smell of smoke in the classroom gave us a moment's warning before 
the principal ran in to tell us to get out. We herded 100 frightened children 
down the long driveway to safety in about three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
As my first-graders wept and trembled, I watched the fire jump the school and 
consume the fenced-in playground. Moments earlier, we were getting ready to go 
out there for lunch. Had the fire started a few minutes later, the playground 
would have been a deathtrap. 
</P>
<P>
Now I was facing my third fire, but I might as well have been a child again, 
for all the good I was doing. I was paralyzed, helpless. 
</P>
<P>
Abruptly, mercifully, the wind changed direction again, and I was out of 
danger. But the unsettled feeling of helplessness haunted me for days. I could 
not allow myself or my family to ever be unprepared again. 
</P>
<P>
We set aside a Sunday afternoon to discuss and plan the actions each of us 
would take if there were another emergency. We talked about indoor escape 
routes and meeting places, and made an evacuation list. First on Kimberly's 
list was her special teddy bear, on Brian's were his roller blades. Most of 
all, Philip and I wanted to save the photographs that chronicle our family 
history. 
</P>
<P>
I think all of us, especially the children, feel more secure in knowing what 
will happen should disaster strike. I can't stop fires from happening. But if 
faced with evacuation again, I won't panic. I'll know exactly what to do, what 
to take, and where to go. 
</P>
<P>
After all, I know fire happens in my neighborhood. It could even happen in 
yours.

MICRO-SOLUTION TO MACRO-PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Encinitas wisely repealed its ban on curbside hiring last week 
rather than force a federal court judge to strike it down. U.S. District Court 
Judge John Rhoades had indicated that the law approved in May was probably 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
But the city's squeaky wheel approach to the North County-wide problem of 
migrant street hiring has brought in the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, agents began issuing reminders to curbside employers to check 
workers for documents. The Sheriff's Department also plans a more questionable 
sweep through migrant camps to enforce trespassing laws. Experience shows that 
sporadic enforcement yields temporary results. Soon after authorities leave, 
migrants are back seeking the day work crucial to their subsistence. 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas' efforts, however, again highlight municipalities' total inability to 
cope with the burden of what is a federal responsibility -- a situation that 
probably won't change until local governments force change.

WORST-CASE EXAMPLE OF POLITICAL SHENANIGANS; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN PROTECTING EMPIRES THAN DOING RIGHT 
THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council's latest exercise in political chicanery was on 
display last week, and, to no one's surprise, its machinations on 
reapportionment produced no shortage of maneuvering. It took less than 24 hours 
for the Chicano Federation to take the entire matter back before U.S. District 
Judge John Rhoades. That's probably where this mess belongs. 
</P>
<P>
The redistricting battle has been brewing for some time in City Hall offices, 
where council members' number-crunchers have been plotting strategy to gain 
maximum political advantage from the required rebalancing of populations in the 
eight districts. No surprise there; that's how the system works, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, an advisory redistricting panel appointed by the council had 
been holding public hearings to redraw district lines. 
</P>
<P>
Its map wasn't free of political taint, either, offering significant advantages 
to some of the council's conservative Republicans. But it was based on months 
of public testimony and debate. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the council's liberal, pro-environment "Gang of Five," which 
controls city policy on many issues by the narrow margin of a single vote, 
produced a map that only its bloc members had seen before. Then it tentatively 
adopted the boundaries by a 5-4 vote. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that the decision violates a provision of the 1988 legal settlement 
of the Chicano Federation's voting rights suit against the city. In that 
document, Rhoades ordered the council to allow minority community 
representatives a meaningful role in shaping the map. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Harry McCue had barred the council from formally 
adopting the map, a decision that was the best course of action under these 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The majority's sin pales before the unparalleled political cowardice of 
Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, who voted for new boundaries that remove Scripps 
Ranch from her 5th District. Bernhardt won an upset victory over incumbent 
"bulldozer" Ed Struiksma last November with the zealous volunteer aid of 
Scripps Ranch environmentalists, who believed the promises that she would 
protect Miramar Lake and the I-15 corridor from development. 
</P>
<P>
Those problems apparently have proven more intractable than Bernhardt foresaw. 
With another major headache -- the reopening of Pomerado Road through Scripps 
Ranch -- on the horizon, Bernhardt simply fled the district. 
</P>
<P>
Who takes over as Scripps Ranch's representative? Bruce Henderson, the reigning 
pro-growth councilman. Henderson, by the way, was the victim of a naked 
gerrymander designed to make him more vulnerable to defeat in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
At the behest of environmental activists, the burgeoning I-15 corridor was 
Balkanized into three council districts so that the council could not dump the 
city's growth on one council member. That may have been a clever growth-control 
tactic, but the fact remains that, in testimony before the advisory panel, many 
I-15 residents asked to be lumped together in one district. 
</P>
<P>
The main issue facing Rhoades, however, is whether the council obeyed federal 
guidelines requiring it to augment the voting power of Latinos and other 
minorities. The adopted plan contains an 8th District that is 51% Latino, 
compared with the 52.2% on the advisory commission map. 
</P>
<P>
That is a small difference. But Chicano Federation lawyers make a compelling 
argument that the ruling bloc, by excluding some fast-growing Latino districts 
in favor of the heavily white neighborhood where incumbent Bob Filner 
conveniently bought a house during the redistricting process, the council 
demonstrated its intent to curb minority voting power. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades will have to sort that one out. We don't know if the reapportionment is 
legal. We do know that, so far, the process has been a crime.

REFLECTIONS: 'I THINK IF PEOPLE REALLY KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THERE IS A PROBLEM, 
THEY COME THROUGH -- WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS'

Lois Brown Tripp, an El Cajon attorney, started rounding up formula, baby food 
and diapers for homeless children two years ago. Tripp, a member of the Del 
Mar-Leucadia chapter of the American Assn. of University Women, now regularly 
organizes baby drives to gather donations for North County charities that help 
homeless children and their families. She was interviewed by Times staff writer 
G. Jeanette Avent and photographed by Bob Grieser. 
</P>
<P>
I never really realized there were children who were homeless. When I thought 
about homeless people, I thought about alcoholics and druggies. But, a couple 
of years ago, I saw an article in the newspaper about San Diego soup kitchens 
not having baby food for babies, and it really bothered me. 
</P>
<P>
Children would have to eat mashed up adult food. This is fine for a child even 
2 or 3, but for an infant, it isn't the thing they need. When you need formula, 
you need formula. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time in 1988, the national American Assn. of University 
Women, which I am a member of, suggested that all chapters become involved in a 
community project. We were to work with a program already in the community, not 
go out and invent our own. 
</P>
<P>
So, at the first board meeting of the Del Mar-Leucadia branch that September, I 
asked the board members if they were aware there were children living on the 
street. I told them about the problem at the shelters and soup kitchens, and 
they said: Lois, you're elected. Go research it. 
</P>
<P>
We had about 60 members at the time, and we decided we'd help as many soup 
kitchens as we could, and we'd help some of the other groups that help homeless 
people with children. 
</P>
<P>
Our list includes the Encinitas Community Resource Center, which places 
homeless families temporarily in motels; Brother Benno's Kitchen; the Martha 
and Mary Shelter for women and children; the North County Chaplaincy, which 
helps migrant workers; the Women's Resource Center for battered women and women 
in crisis; St. Claire's, a program for single pregnant women; and Casa de 
Amparo for abused children. 
</P>
<P>
The children at Casa aren't homeless, but we mistakenly delivered some things 
to them once and then got a nice letter back saying how nice it was to receive 
the baby things and how much Casa needed them. We thought why not, so we just 
included them. 
</P>
<P>
The North County Chaplaincy is the Rev. Rafael Martinez's work. Last year we 
donated money for birthing kits because there are so many migrant women who 
have their babies in the field. 
</P>
<P>
The visiting nurse put together birthing kits that consisted of clothes, towels 
and things you would use to take care of a newborn baby. 
</P>
<P>
The items were packed in plastic, oval-shaped pans, and the women used those as 
a bed for the babies because they were the right size. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, we contacted each of the North County groups to find out what 
they needed, and we came up with a list of things they wanted, including 
formula, baby food, bottles, wipes, disposable diapers, baby clothes and 
blankets. 
</P>
<P>
We started very small by asking all our members to please bring baby food. 
</P>
<P>
After some publicity, we got so many phone calls from the community, it was 
unbelievable. I would have 10 calls a night, and my co-chairman would have as 
many. People sent checks and delivered items to us. My garage became the 
storehouse. 
</P>
<P>
We became sort of like a funnel from the community to these organizations. 
People would say, "I'm so glad to know I can give things to somebody, and it 
will get to where it's supposed to." 
</P>
<P>
The first year, 1988-89, we raised about $3,000 in products and money. We use 
the funds to go out and buy more baby food and diapers. 
</P>
<P>
This year, it's about $8,300, and we also have a special program. It's called 
the mile of pennies. There are $844.80 in each mile of pennies, and we are $60 
short of raising our second mile. People all have pennies and they give them to 
us. That's in addition to bringing baby food. 
</P>
<P>
We have also gone to grocery stores on the Saturday before Palm Sunday in our 
area and handed out a flyer about homeless babies and asked shoppers if they 
would bring out a jar of baby food. People brought out bags. 
</P>
<P>
It was just wonderful. One young man came out with three or four jars of 
custard, and he said he looked at all the jars and tried to remember what he 
liked best. Another time, a woman literally emptied her pockets out and 
apologized because she only had $10 in some change. Another gave a $50 check. 
</P>
<P>
I think, if people really know and understand there is a problem, they come 
through -- with few exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
I spoke at one of the service clubs last summer, and one gentlemen argued with 
me throughout the entire program that these homeless children were abused. The 
parents didn't have a home for them so therefore they should be removed from 
the parents, he said. We argued all the way through the parking lot. I told him 
he was very, very wrong. Things happen. People have medical bills, or they lose 
their job. 
</P>
<P>
Some people say, "Why do you need bottles, why don't these women breast feed?" 
Many of these mothers are quite young. One was a 12-year-old and another a 
15-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing is, if they are truly living on the street, they are not getting 
the proper nutrition. Also, would you like to breast-feed your child behind a 
bush or on a park bench? I'm sure there are psychological things that make 
physiological differences. 
</P>
<P>
In my practice, I do some criminal law, and everything I've read indicates 
people who are consistently in and out of jail have poor childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Poor nutrition plays a large part in children paying attention at school. 
Nutrition for babies is important. 
</P>
<P>
We are looking at the future citizens of the United States. I just wish there 
were no more women and children on the streets. It's so sad.

OTHER AREAS VYING FOR EL SEGUNDO SPACE BASE; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: SOUTH BAY FACILITY MAY BE CLOSED BECAUSE OF MILITARY BUDGET CUTS. 
THOUSANDS OF JOBS COULD GO WITH IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Business leaders in Southern California's Inland Empire, Albuquerque, N.M., and 
Colorado Springs, Colo., are lobbying hard to land two highly prized space 
research and development facilities that could be moved from El Segundo if the 
federal government decides to close the Air Force base there. 
</P>
<P>
The base is one of five in the country that the Air Force may shut down as part 
of a government drive to reduce defense spending and streamline the military. 
</P>
<P>
Closure would mean moving the base's main component, the 3,200-employee Air 
Force Space Systems Division, and probably the Aerospace Corp., a private, 
nonprofit employer of 4,000 that works closely with the Air Force division from 
its headquarters bordering the base. 
</P>
<P>
Local business leaders have only recently begun trying to save the space 
facilities, considered key players in the area's aerospace industry. They are 
clearly unnerved by the competition from rivals in Riverside, Albuquerque and 
Colorado Springs, which have been mentioned as possible relocation sites. 
</P>
<P>
"There is growing alarm about this," said Bill Mason, president-elect of the El 
Segundo Chamber of Commerce. "It would have a serious impact on business in the 
L.A. Basin and particularly in the South Bay area." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Gov. George Deukmejian has taken a hands-off approach to the 
base-closing issue, reluctant to favor one California community over another. 
The governors of Colorado and New Mexico, however, are aggressively campaigning 
for the space operations, as are business groups in Albuquerque and Colorado 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is competing hard for this," said Albuquerque businessman Kenn 
Holzer, head of a panel that New Mexico Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers appointed in 
May to woo the Air Force space division. "It's like a football game." 
</P>
<P>
The scramble started Jan. 29 when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Air Force 
Secretary Donald Rice unveiled a broad cost-cutting blueprint affecting Air 
Force bases worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Five domestic bases were earmarked for possible closure: Bergstrom AFB in 
Texas, Eaker AFB in Arkansas, Myrtle Beach AFB in South Carolina and Los 
Angeles AFB at El Segundo Boulevard and Isis Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials say high housing costs and a scarcity of land for expansion 
are the main reasons the El Segundo base is included on the list. In December, 
Rice will make final recommendations on the proposed closing, which would 
require approval by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the Air Force did not look beyond California for alternative sites 
for its Space Systems Division. Its only candidate initially was Vandenberg AFB 
near Lompoc. Since then, the service has begun studying others: March AFB near 
Riverside, Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, and the Peterson and Falcon bases near 
Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
There has been little lobbying so far for Vandenberg, experts say. But business 
leaders in Riverside, Albuquerque and Colorado Springs have launched aggressive 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our No. 1 priority this year," said Wanda Reeves of Colorado Springs, 
a member of a state-appointed task force created to promote Colorado's defense 
industry. "I think we have a very good shot." 
</P>
<P>
In the Inland Empire, the lobbying is being led by a coalition of business and 
civic organizations from Riverside and San Bernardino counties, called the 
Inland Empire Space Systems Division Relocation Group. 
</P>
<P>
'We're going out to all the cities in the two-county area (to get) resolutions 
of support," said Stephen Albright, chairman of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The interest is not surprising. Plenty of business and brains come with the 
base, which is dominated by the Space Systems Division but also includes 
administrative offices, a motor pool, a medical clinic, a day-care center and 
other support services. 
</P>
<P>
The Space Systems Division and the Aerospace Corp. oversee research as well as 
planning and procurement of military space hardware ranging from heavy-lift 
rockets to spy and navigational satellites to space-based weapons for the 
Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the two organizations add significantly to the pool of 
engineering and scientific talent that underlies Los Angeles' aerospace 
industry. The Aerospace Corp. alone employs about 600 doctorate-level 
scientists and engineers, according to company spokesperson Robin Friedheim. 
</P>
<P>
The military space work also bolsters the local economy. The combined annual 
payroll at Los Angeles AFB -- most of it for the Space Systems Division -- and 
the Aerospace Corp. totals $314 million. Their combined spending for Los 
Angeles-area goods and services exceeds $360 million a year, with a local 
economic impact exceeding $1 billion annually, the Air Force says. 
</P>
<P>
It's a resource Los Angeles business groups are loath to lose. After months of 
inaction, they recently began planning a joint lobbying campaign through the 
18-member South Bay Assn. of Chambers of Commerce and the Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The first goal, they say, is to seek support from California's congressional 
delegation. But they'll be up against intense competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We think (the space facilities) would give Colorado Springs another important 
element of the military space program, and that could mean valuable spin-offs," 
said Thomas Schilling of Colorado Gov. Roy Romer's business development office. 
"We could have additional private-sector aerospace business moving into the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
In the Inland Empire, business groups say such high-tech growth would provide 
good local jobs for a large number of residents currently commuting to the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Said Andrew Moore of the Inland Empire Economic Council, one of the business 
groups participating in the drive to move the space division to March AFB: 
"This kind of job creation comes once in a decade." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it materializes, however, hinges on the base-closing decision. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials say it is by no means certain that the base will be 
liquidated. It could be left as is or stripped of only a portion of its space 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The key reasons for considering closure, they say, are the high cost of housing 
and land in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force recently built 170 single-family houses for officers near Ft. 
MacArthur in San Pedro, its main housing facility for military families. But 
that brings the total number of units to only 575. More than 1,300 of the 
base's military personnel contend with the Los Angeles area's inhospitable 
housing market. 
</P>
<P>
The higher cost of living in Los Angeles not only costs the Air Force a great 
deal of money, officials say, it also repels talented civilian engineers and 
scientists who are sought for the Space Systems Division. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've got a technician who can get a job at competitive pay in the 
Colorado Springs space command or move the family to Los Angeles, what do you 
think they are going to do?" said Capt. Jack Giese of the Air Force's public 
affairs office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Giese said another consideration is that the cost of land might make future 
expansion of the Space Systems Division too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"You always have to be looking into the future, and space (activity) is always 
going to be growing," he said. "We have to have quality people and quality 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
South Bay business leaders acknowledge such drawbacks but argue that, on 
balance, a move from El Segundo would be unwise. 
</P>
<P>
They say the transfer could give frustrated private aerospace contractors one 
more reason to leave the region. It might also be more expensive than keeping 
the facilities in El Segundo, they add, pointing out that new ones would have 
to be built elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
That argument could carry weight if the Air Force is unable to use the money 
from the sale of its 100-acre El Segundo base and its 130-acre San Pedro 
holdings to offset the cost of new installations. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has said it will not close the base unless Congress 
passes a bill authorizing the Air Force to spend the proceeds from such a sale. 
</P>
<P>
As they grapple with these issues, some local businessmen fault Deukmejian for 
failing to come to their aid. 
</P>
<P>
"If these facilities leave, it would leave a cavity the size of the Grand 
Canyon in this area," said Bob Marsella, president of the Hawthorne Chamber of 
Commerce. "And yet Sacramento is not saying anything. I don't understand it. 
I've been very frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Gibson, director of the state Department of Commerce, said Deukmejian 
is strongly opposed to moving the two space facilities from California. But he 
said the governor has not fought to keep the Los Angeles air base open because 
it would appear that he was favoring one California community over another. 
</P>
<P>
"The local communities are going to have to marshal their forces as best they 
can," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
That presents an opening to the out-of-state suitors, who are busily touting 
their wider availability of land, cheaper housing and less-congested 
environment, among other advantages. 
</P>
<P>
Both Colorado and New Mexico have a track record of hosting military space 
facilities. Kirtland AFB has a space weaponry research center, and Colorado 
Springs is the headquarters for the Air Force's space command and the 
military's joint U.S. command. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two, Colorado appears better positioned politically. Three members of 
its congressional delegation hold seats on their respective house's armed 
services committees: Democratic Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, Republican Rep. Joel 
Hefley and Democratic Rep. Patricia Schroeder, who chairs the House's military 
installations and facilities subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Holzer declined to say whether New Mexico is offering the Air Force economic 
incentives to relocate its El Segundo space unit there. Reeves says Colorado 
will offer incentives, but she would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't say what they are until they are completely signed off on," she said. 
"That would be letting it out of the bag."

OIL FIELD OF DREAMS; 
</P>
<P>
PARKLANDS: THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT DONATED LAND FOR A SANTA CLARITA VALLEY 
SPORTS COMPLEX. BUT A TITLE SEARCH SHOWS PETROLEUM COMPANIES, AMONG MANY 
OTHERS, HOLD RIGHTS TO THE PARCEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning, everybody agreed that the desolate stretch of land in Castaic 
inhabited by lizards and a few hardy steers would make a great spot for some 
ball fields. 
</P>
<P>
Scouts for the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation reached 
that conclusion after scouring the Santa Clarita Valley for a spot to build a 
much needed sports complex. With private land too exorbitant to buy, parks 
officials were happy when the Sheriff's Department offered to donate the land, 
which it considered to be surplus. 
</P>
<P>
The land was flat. It was conveniently located next to the county's regional 
parks office. And the property was vacant except for two oil wells on the 
periphery. 
</P>
<P>
But the county's luck ran out quickly. The trouble began when county officials 
learned that oil investors, who they didn't know existed, had rights to drill 
almost anywhere on the property. If they wanted, they could legally erect an 
oil well in the future on a baseball field pitcher's mound. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured the Sheriff's Department had clear title, then the more we looked 
the worse it got, the more complex it got," said Ruth Roess, a county park 
planner. 
</P>
<P>
A title search of the 51-acre spread uncovered more problems, said Jane Graham, 
a senior real property agent in the county's Internal Services Department, who 
is trying to help untangle the mess. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate report showed that the title was clouded with 55 entities that 
had current or old interests in the property. Many of the interests were held 
by utility companies that have easements running through the property. 
</P>
<P>
There also were some odd entries. The county discovered that the federal 
government had reserved the right for someone to live on the property decades 
ago. The federal government also had protected its right to enter the property 
for purposes spelled out in the "Act of June 10, 1920 (42 Stat. 1063)." No one 
has looked that up yet. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the county was surprised to learn that it doesn't even own the 
entire acreage. Two or three acres are owned by Southern California Gas Co., 
with oil rights on that small plot shared by people who hold as little as 2/108 
interest, the title report showed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unusual to have a little piece of property out there in the middle of 
nowhere," Graham said. "You wonder, 'Gee, how did that happen?' They might not 
know they've got it," she said, referring to the gas company. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate snags have delayed the project for two years, said Etsel 
Yamasaki, the park project coordinator. Neither Yamasaki, nor anyone else, can 
say with any certainty whether the entire project can be saved. County 
officials, however, said they are confident that at least part of the complex 
can be built by designing the park to accommodate oil wells. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the construction of a swimming pool, gymnasium, softball and 
baseball fields, tennis courts and a playground. 
</P>
<P>
The sports facilities are greatly needed, said Cecilia Foley, recreation 
superintendent with the city of Santa Clarita. Several thousand softball 
players now share just four city ball fields. Numerous teams have been waiting 
for a baseball diamond for at least a year. The city triggered a barrage of 
complaints this year when, in an effort to free up the fields for more teams, 
it started limiting the number of teams a person could play on. "Everyone is 
competing for the same space," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
The county is spending $80,000 to study whether the sports complex project is 
feasible as proposed, should be cut in size or shelved. The studies should be 
completed by January. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the study, a consultant will try to pinpoint the location of the 
many natural gas, oil, water and phone lines crisscrossing under the property 
to see if they would interfere with the park's construction plans. 
</P>
<P>
Others will try to contact everyone mentioned in the title report. The people 
will be contacted to see if they would be willing to either abandon or sell 
their claims to the property. 
</P>
<P>
Elaborate efforts must be made to find all the missing people. Phone books, 
motor vehicle and voting records and military rolls will all be used in the 
search. And the hunt doesn't end if the person is deceased. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you have to find out who their children were and where they are. That's 
what we're up against," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
If a person cannot be found, the county must demonstrate to a judge that it has 
exhausted all avenues before his or her claim is nullified. Sometimes it takes 
a year to locate people or their heirs, but the county would not have to 
postpone all work on the project until everyone is located, Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest decision for the county is whether it wants the sports 
complex to coexist with oil wells. 
</P>
<P>
The county received the encumbered piece of property in 1953 in a swap with the 
federal government for land in the Angeles National Forest. As part of the 
transaction, the federal Bureau of Land Management retained the mineral and oil 
rights to the land. This fact never mattered because the land, fenced off as 
part of the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, wasn't used for much except cattle 
grazing and crops. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, county officials believed that they would only have to work around 
two wells on the property that are owned by Commander Oil Ltd. But one day they 
were contacted by a representative of another oil venture, which plans to erect 
up to seven oil wells on or near the park site. The venture leased the oil 
rights from the BLM five years ago and is only now getting ready to drill. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye R. McCown, the geologist for the joint oil venture, said he has assured 
the county that he and his partners want to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to get all these oil fields in before they build the park, then it 
will be easier for them to work around it," McCown said. 
</P>
<P>
L.P. Brown III, the president of T&amp;F Co. in Beverly Hills, which is the 
venture's financial backer, said the wells don't have to be eyesores. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, it might make this whole Santa Clarita Valley sports complex 
aesthetically intriguing or interesting." 
</P>
<P>
"You can paint them any number of colors," Brown said. But he added, "we won't 
make them Art Deco or anything."

2 SCHOOLS ON VIOLENCE IN CLASSROOM; 
</P>
<P>
DISCIPLINE: A 6-YEAR-OLD ENCINO-BASED ORGANIZATION REMAINS A SOURCE OF 
CONTROVERSY BETWEEN POLICE AND EDUCATORS. ITS DIRECTOR SAYS IT IS TRYING TO 
BETTER BALANCE ITS LAW-AND-ORDER STANCE WITH THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. 
</P>

<P>
A federally funded office began six years ago to help schools nationwide deal 
with student violence by using old-fashioned discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the National School Safety Center in Encino draws praise from police 
agencies and many school districts that have turned to it for advice. "You can 
pick up a phone from anywhere and ask, 'Are there any school districts using 
dogs to sniff out drugs?' or 'Is there any school policy that is effective at 
reducing bullying?' " said Wesley Mitchell, chief of police for the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the center, a source of controversy from the beginning, continues to draw 
criticism from educators and others who complain that it religiously follows 
the law-and-order credo of its creator, former President Reagan, while failing 
to address the roots of gang and school violence. 
</P>
<P>
The center "was set up as an ideological tool," said Irwin Hyman, director of 
the National Center for the Study of Corporal Punishment and Alternatives in 
School at Temple University in Philadelphia. "It was not set up as a national 
center where research would be made and information disseminated," Hyman said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan announced formation of the center in a radio address Jan. 7, 1984. Its 
purpose, he said, was to publish information for school officials on their 
legal rights in dealing with disruptive students and to serve as a 
clearinghouse for school safety resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Early on there may have been a stronger law-and-order approach, but we are 
trying to balance that with the rights of individuals," said Ronald D. 
Stephens, the center's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens said the advice given districts is not shaped by any particular 
ideological agenda. He said the center's approach mirrors the philosophy of the 
Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, 
which oversees the center's work. 
</P>
<P>
The center has spent nearly $10 million in federal money since it opened. It 
operates under the auspices of Pepperdine University, producing and selling 
pamphlets, films and magazines on school crime issues, and providing speakers 
on gangs, drugs and student violence. 
</P>
<P>
School officials from several districts across the country credit the center 
with suggesting crime-fighting methods that have soothed communities stunned by 
outbreaks of campus violence. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the gang-related killing of a high school junior in a Cleveland 
suburb prompted school officials there to call the NSSC. 
</P>
<P>
"There was instant panic and we needed help," said Lauree Gearity, 
superintendent of the Cleveland Heights-University Heights School District. 
"They flew out that week. They told us that we were not like Los Angeles, that 
our gangs were in the formative stages and that we could do things to prevent 
more problems." 
</P>
<P>
A similar panic hit Little Rock, Ark., after the killing of a junior high 
school student two years ago. "The community was really upset," recalled Bill 
Barnhouse, director of safety and security for the 22,000-student Little Rock 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the center's suggestions adopted by the Cleveland and Little Rock 
school districts include creating a student code of conduct, trimming bushes 
around schools to remove hiding places for assailants and installing special 
mirrors in school hallways so teachers can see around corners, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Los Angeles Police Department Officer Gus Frias, now manager of the 
Orange County Office of Education's Operation Safe Schools program, said he and 
the center have worked together on a training class called Gang School for 
Educators. 
</P>
<P>
"We have educators trained during the 1950s with curriculum obsolete to deal 
with today's issues of crime and violence," Frias said. "The center provides 
brochures and updated information from their findings nationwide." 
</P>
<P>
An article in the fall issue of the center's School Safety magazine suggested 
that school officials install metal detectors, hire more guards, increase 
student penalties and conduct random searches to squelch campus crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Squeamishness about taking such measures often reflects administrators' public 
relations worries more than anything else," said the article, written by Karl 
Zinsmeister of the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a 
conservative think tank based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The King County Police Department, which serves Seattle, credits the center as 
one source of information used in its newly released gang awareness manual. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. Loren Kramer, who is working with Stephens 
to create a federally financed program to attack gang and drug problems 
nationally, said the center provides up-to-date information on school crime 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked with Ron and I'm impressed with his knowledge and commitment," 
said Kramer, head of the department's narcotics group. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard James, a Pepperdine law professor and an NSSC staff member, said 
another important job of the center is to educate school districts and police 
departments about the kinds of information they can legally share. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, information about juveniles' arrests and convictions has been 
considered confidential so youths will not be unfairly labeled criminals and 
denied a chance at rehabilitation. But James said that approach is not always 
in the best interests of the child. 
</P>
<P>
"Confidentiality has not had the intended benign effect on youthful offenders, 
and, in fact, it has disastrously undermined the prevention and control of 
serious crimes they commit," according to the center's handbook, "The Need to 
Know -- Juvenile Record Sharing." 
</P>
<P>
"Schools always benefit knowing who the bad apples are," said James, one of the 
handbook's authors. "Information sharing is a pivotal piece of the school 
safety issue." 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, say the center's law-and-order approach is too narrow and can 
harm students. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids need strict limits but that alone is not going to work; it does not 
allow them to grow up and learn to regulate themselves," said Robert L. Selman, 
a professor in the School of Education at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton High School's dean of students, Carolee Bogue, said that after 15 
years in the Los Angeles school district she believes "punitive means are never 
the solution. You never make kids do better by making them feel worse." 
</P>
<P>
In its literature, for instance, the center gives high marks to Superior Court 
Judge C. Robert Jameson, presiding judge of the Juvenile Court in Orange 
County, who a year ago formally ordered all school districts, police 
departments, prosecutors and probation officers in the county to release 
information to each other about any student believed to be a gang member or "at 
significant risk of becoming a gang member." 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Biegel, a professor in both the law school and graduate school of 
education at UCLA, said the center historically has been at one end of the 
struggle between law enforcement and the right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"People who want to fight crime constantly find that privacy rights get in 
their way," Biegel said. "In a policeman's ideal world, any evidence you 
uncover would be admitted and you could get at any records." 
</P>
<P>
Critics also say the center's active role in legal and community issues 
demonstrates that an unstated purpose of the center is to further conservative 
ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens and James, for instance, served on a task force created by state 
Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge) last summer to review her 
longstanding campaign to break up the Los Angeles school district. La 
Follette's efforts to create separate school districts in the San Fernando 
Valley, which was recommended by the task force, has received most of its 
support from middle- and upper middle-income parents opposed to the busing of 
children from the inner city to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The NSSC filed a friend of the court brief in support of a Washington school 
district's right to suspend a student who had delivered a school election 
speech that included racy jokes. 
</P>
<P>
The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1986 overturned a lower 
court's ruling favoring the student's free-speech rights. The center also filed 
a brief supporting the right of police in an Orange County city to stop and 
question youngsters suspected of being truants in a court case eventually heard 
by the state Supreme Court in 1987. The state's high court declared the public 
interest in enforcing truancy laws outweighed any intrusion on individual 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Also, critics say, many of the center's crime prevention suggestions are little 
more than the sort of common sense school officials should already know. 
</P>
<P>
In its printed materials and films, children are encouraged, for example, to 
participate in sports and join churches rather than gangs. School officials are 
advised to keep track of incidents of school violence, make plans for campus 
disasters and restrict access to schools by outsiders. Parents are asked to 
volunteer their time at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles school district, where growing campus violence prompted the 
school board last month to order automatic expulsions for students bringing 
guns to school, the center apparently has had little impact, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They send me materials from time to time, but we have not disseminated any 
information about their materials to schools," said Lulu Lopez, who developed 
the district's curriculum on gang prevention for elementary school children. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestions in the center's publications and speeches come from experts in 
law, education and school safety, said Stephens. Because the NSSC was created 
to be a national clearinghouse, he said, its value comes from reporting school 
safety methods being tried across the country. Most of the nation's 16,000 
school districts do not have the experience of school officials in cities such 
as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Department of Justice say they are pleased with the center's 
work. Lois Brown, who oversees the federal grant for the NSSC, said she 
foresees no trouble in getting approval this fall for the center's proposed 
1990-91 budget of $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It would seem to me that if they weren't in existence someone would have to 
invent them," Brown said. "People need the expertise."

PEANUT OIL BREAST IMPLANTS COULD MAKE SURGERY SAFER 
</P>

A breast implant filled with peanut oil could mean safer breast enlargements 
for thousands of women who have the surgery each year, a radiologist says. 
</P>
<P>
Because the oil is transparent, the new implants do not interfere with X-ray 
mammography for breast cancer the way silicone breast implants can, said Judy 
Destouet, head of the mammography unit at Washington University's Mallinckrodt 
Institute of Radiology. 
</P>
<P>
"They appear like the fat in the breast -- you can see through it," Destouet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Destouet and Leroy Young, associate professor of plastic and reconstructive 
surgery at Washington University School of Medicine, are heading the 
development of the new implant. 
</P>
<P>
The most common implant now is filled with silicone gel, which appears as dense 
as bone in X-rays and therefore can hamper early detection of breast cancer, 
Destouet said. Others are filled with saline, or a combination of silicone and 
saline. 
</P>
<P>
"I think many women need (breast augmentation) for self-esteem, and I think 
that we should have the freedom to do what we want for our bodies," Destouet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hoped to develop a better product that would allow women to augment their 
breasts but won't take away the benefits of state-of-the-art mammography. We 
feel that we have something that really can be a safe alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Breast augmentation is one of the most popular cosmetic surgery procedures 
available, according to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive 
Surgeons Inc. in Arlington Heights, Ill. About 72,000 women undergo breast 
augmentation each year, said spokeswoman Cathleen Coyne. 
</P>
<P>
But some doctors disagree that implants interfere with early cancer detection. 
</P>
<P>
Studies by Dr. Garry Brody at the University of Southern California followed 
3,000 women in the Los Angeles area who have had breast augmentation. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus far, the delay is theoretic only. It's certainly a possibility, but when 
we look at the statistics, we can't find the delay. Their cancer seems to be 
picked up at the same stage as the unaugmented population." 
</P>
<P>
The American Cancer Society estimates that one woman in 10 will develop breast 
cancer in her lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Cline, a plastic surgeon and psychologist in San Francisco, said she 
discourages women with a family history of breast cancer from having the 
surgery. "But the average women, I don't feel -- given the improvements in 
radiological techniques -- that it is a major issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington University researchers have spent the last year conducting tests 
on rats and rabbits to make sure their implants have no adverse effects, such 
as allergic reactions or extreme scar tissue formation. 
</P>
<P>
"So far our animal studies are very favorable," Destouet said. "There really 
are no side effects." 
</P>
<P>
Once the researchers get U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, the 
implants will be tested in women. They could be available commercially in about 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Destouet said the researchers came upon peanut oil as a safe implant filler 
when they turned to their chemistry books to find which substances would allow 
X-ray penetration, and which of those substances were not carcinogenic. 
</P>
<P>
The implants still use a thin silicone shell to hold the peanut oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a better envelope too," Destouet said. "You can't invent everything at 
the same time."

GALANTER OFFERS PLAN TO SAVE SAND DUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter proposed Friday that 200 acres of 
ecologically sensitive sand dunes at the west end of Los Angeles International 
Airport's runways be turned into a nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by a handful of supporters at the site and fighting to be heard as 
jumbo jets screamed overhead, Galanter said the airport should abandon its 
long-stalled plan to convert about 200 acres of the 302-acre dunes into a golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Galanter said, the airport should use only 100 acres of the dunes, best 
known as a habitat for the endangered El Segundo Blue butterfly, for the golf 
course. The airport could complete the course by using another 50 acres it owns 
next to the dunes on the north side of LAX, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can have the butterfly and we can have the golfers," Galanter said. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter's proposal has not been formally presented to other council members or 
to the city Airport Commission. Clifton Moore, general manager of the Airport 
Department, said he and Galanter have discussed her proposal in general terms 
but not in detail. 
</P>
<P>
"We have indicated we will keep an open mind and talk about it," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter's plan to use 50 acres on the airport's north side for a golf course 
clashes with the airport's plan to use the land as part of a large office and 
research park development. The parcel is part of 350 acres once dotted with 
homes that were acquired by the airport because of severe jet noise. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Miller, the airport's deputy executive director, said work has already 
began on a four-lane highway for the office park project, which is to extend 
from Sepulveda Eastway to Pershing Drive. The airport recently received final 
approval from the city for the development to proceed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter contends that most of the land for the office project will be paved 
for parking lots. By redesigning the project and building underground parking 
structures, she said, 50 acres could be found for the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
The dunes that Galanter wants to protect are the last large section of a dune 
system that once stretched from Point Conception, above Santa Barbara, south to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The airport began work to establish a habitat for the El Segundo Blue butterfly 
on the dunes in the late 1970s, shortly after the insect was classified as 
endangered by the federal government. About five years ago, the airport 
proposed using 200 acres of the dunes for a golf course and turning the rest 
into a nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
That plan was stalled in 1987 when the California Coastal Commission refused to 
give the airport permission to move ahead because it was unclear what effect 
the golf course would have on the butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials hired scientist Rudy Mattoni to do a biological study of the 
dunes to determine the golf course's effect. Mattoni's study identified at 
least nine insects, including the El Segundo Blue butterfly, and a flower that 
apparently live only on the dunes and could be classified as endangered. 
</P>
<P>
Mattoni, who supports Galanter's plan, said the butterfly is now flourishing on 
the dunes. If 200 acres of the dunes are preserved, he said, the entire dune 
ecosystem would have a better chance of surviving. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to preserve the whole ecosystem, this whole community of 
interactions," Mattoni said. "I'm not worried about the butterfly; I am worried 
about everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Mattoni's study found that native plant and animal life on the dunes has been 
seriously affected over the years by development and soil contamination, which 
in turn have allowed non-native species to invade the area. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 20 original mammals believed to have lived on the dunes, only three 
remain, Mattoni said. Of the 91 original plant species, only 58 remain and 19 
are in danger of being eliminated.

ATTORNEYS IN CAMARENA CASE TRADE CHARGES OF DISTORTION IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents seeking "vengeance" for the murder 
of fellow agent Enrique Camarena used overly zealous tactics in pursuing his 
killers and ensnared innocent men, defense lawyers charged in closing arguments 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The righteous desire for vengeance does not justify twisting the evidence and 
convicting by innuendo," said lawyer Mary Kelly, who represents Juan Jose 
Bernabe Ramirez. Bernabe, who faces life in prison if convicted, is one of four 
men on trial in federal court for their alleged involvement in Camarena's 1985 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
In his rebuttal argument, Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel A. Medrano accused 
defense lawyers of distorting the evidence in the case and trying to create "a 
smoke screen" by their charges against DEA agents. 
</P>
<P>
"The conduct of DEA agents in this case always has been aboveboard," Medrano 
declared. At another point, the prosecutor said "the DEA agents want the 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
After three days of closing arguments, which ended Friday afternoon, U.S. 
District Judge Edward Rafeedie told the six-man, six-woman jury that he would 
give them formal instructions Monday morning and then begin their 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Kelly told the jurors that the government had neglected to tell 
them that Bernabe had responded "No, no," when an undercover DEA agent posing 
as a drug dealer had asked her client if he was present when Camarena was 
interrogated and tortured at a Guadalajara house in February, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
She played an enhanced version of the tape and used a slide projector to show 
the transcript on a courtroom wall. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Operation Leyenda, the special DEA unit that has been 
investigating Camarena's murder for five years, she told jurors: "I'm not 
saying they are bad people, but they see with Leyenda eyes and they hear with 
Leyenda ears." 
</P>
<P>
She and her co-counsel, Michael Meza, had an uphill battle. Bernabe, a one-time 
bodyguard for Mexican drug kingpin Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, who is now 
imprisoned in Mexico for his role in Camarena's murder, boasted on secretly 
made videotapes that he had been at the house where Camarena was tortured and 
that he had helped Mexican drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero escape from the 
Guadalajara airport after Camarena was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Meza tried to explain this away by saying his client hadn't really been at 
either place and fabricated this story in an attempt to con someone into paying 
him $10,000 for information he didn't really have. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano urged the jurors to review all the tape transcripts, saying that such a 
review would show that Bernabe was at the house and the airport and was guilty. 
He reminded the jurors there also had been eyewitness testimony that Bernabe 
helped Caro escape. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor attacked the closing argument delivered Thursday by Edward 
Medvene, the attorney for defendant Ruben Zuno Arce. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to 38 charts that Medvene had utilized in court in an attempt to 
demonstrate that his client was innocent, Medrano characterized the move as 
"one of the most overwhelming dog-and-pony shows I have ever seen in a 
courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
Martin R. Stolar, an attorney for defendant Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, also 
attempted to persuade the jurors that DEA agents in their hunger for 
convictions had utilized a dubious operative who should have been indicted for 
Camarena's murder rather than being put on the federal payroll. 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Antonio Garate Bustamante, a former commander with the 
Guadalajara riot police, should have been indicted because he participated in a 
December, 1984, meeting where plans to kill Camarena were discussed, according 
to a prosecution witness. Instead, Stolar said, Garate became "a government 
witness factory" and produced three key government witnesses in the trial, all 
of whom Stolar said were untrustworthy. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Medrano said Stolar had mischaracterized the testimony about the 
December, 1984, meeting and steadfastly maintained that the three witnesses 
were reliable and had held up on cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the government had relocated the three witnesses and their 
families from Mexico to the United States. He said this had to be done because 
if any of the three men returned to Mexico, they would be killed. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano also contended that the funds spent by the DEA on the case were paltry 
compared to the billions in profits raked in by drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano referred to Matta and Zuno as "the Lee Iacoccas of their (drug) 
corporation." And he concluded his argument by quoting William Shakespeare on 
the subject of cowards. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Kelly, a veteran criminal defense lawyer, described a scene from the 
1957 movie "Twelve Angry Men" in trying to hammer home to the jurors the 
meaning of the presumption of innocence. In the film, all the jurors except 
one, played by Henry Fonda, start their deliberations thinking the defendant is 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, an exasperated juror turns to Fonda and asks, "Why are you 
convinced he's innocent?" Kelly told the jury that Fonda responded: "I'm not 
convinced he's innocent; I'm just not convinced he's guilty." And she reminded 
the jurors that the government had to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt 
to secure a conviction.

PIER FACE LIFT TO RESTORE GRANDEUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Time has not been kind to the 70-year-old Manhattan Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-tile roof has disappeared from the roundhouse at the end of the 
pier, along with the distinctive weather vane that was atop the building when 
it was completed in 1921. At some point during the decades, ornamental light 
poles along the pier's 928-foot length were abandoned in favor of modern 
stanchions. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, however, the city intends to halt time's destructive ways as it 
returns the sightseeing and fishing pier to its 1920s style through an 
almost-total reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Only the concrete pilings will be retained as the pier gets a stronger 
reinforced concrete deck, a reconstructed roundhouse, new deck curbs and 
railings, and globe lights atop classical columns. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.7-million project -- funded largely with state and federal money -- 
begins in January, when the pier will be closed. It will take 10 months to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Kelly, city public works director, said the project was launched to 
halt deterioration of the pier. In one instance, a man was awarded $3.2 million 
when he was paralyzed after a 150-pound concrete chunk fell from the pier onto 
him. The area beneath the pier is fenced off for safety. 
</P>
<P>
In designing the reconstruction, the city sought to recapture as much of the 
pier's "original splendor" as possible, Kelly said. The pier was built to 
promote tourism and development in the city. The roundhouse -- presently a 
marine education center for students -- originally was a 40-seat restaurant. In 
the reconstruction, designed by architect Richard Gemigniani, the roundhouse 
will get French doors, a red Spanish-tile roof and a copper cupola and weather 
vane. When the work is completed, the education center will be returned to the 
building, which will gain a snack bar. A bait and tackle shop, now in a small 
building at pier's end, will be moved into the roundhouse.

3 MORE SHOT BY HARBOR AREA GANGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three Harbor area teen-agers were injured early Saturday in drive-by shootings 
as continuing gang violence led Los Angeles police to temporarily assign 
several squads of Metropolitan Division officers to the community. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival Friday of the Metro officers followed two recent shootings on 
police patroling Dana Strand Village, a Wilmington housing project. Earlier, 
LAPD officials disclosed that the Harbor Division's staffing would be increased 
with some two dozen officers and gang specialists from three other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to avoid the appearance of an occupation of the Harbor because we 
have worked hard with the community and don't want to move in like storm 
troopers," said Harbor Division Lt. Kathleen Murcott. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have a gang problem that is simply unmanageable with our own resources, 
and we need some help," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The gang problem includes a string of 33 drive-by shootings in the Harbor area 
since mid-May in which three people have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the death of a Wilmington gang member at Dana Strand Village 
prompted two incidents in which shots were fired at officers patrolling the 
384-unit housing project. In the first incident, last weekend, one officer was 
grazed by a bullet. The second, early Thursday, led to the arrest of a 
17-year-old gang member. 
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, it appeared that two officers were again shot at in the project 
when they answered a disturbance call at 1 a.m. Police said later, however, 
that the officers only heard gunfire near Dana Strand and were not the targets. 
</P>
<P>
But three area teen-agers were shot in two separate gang-related incidents 
Saturday. Police said Moris Soto, 14, of Wilmington, was critically wounded by 
gunfire at 3:15 a.m. as he stood talking with friends in the 200 block of Opp 
Street. One hour earlier, Francisco Gomez and Rodolfo Ruelas, both 17, were 
shot on 206th Street near Harvard Boulevard in the Harbor Gateway. Ruelas was 
hospitalized in stable condition with a bullet wound to his side; Gomez 
suffered a gunshot to his hand. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made in either shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, friends and family of Patricia Florencio, 27, of Wilmington, held a 
carwash Saturday to help pay for her funeral. Florencio was killed July 7 in a 
shooting that police have blamed on her boyfriend, a gang member.

government crackdown on cheating, education officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
They said those expelled were among nearly 1 million students taking a weeklong 
nationwide examination that started Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Most students were caught trying to copy from notebooks hidden under their

CAN IT GET ANY WORSE FOR PADRES? YES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bip Roberts, teary-eyed, sat in front of his locker Saturday, spitting blood 
into a paper cup. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter, having difficulties just putting his left shoe over his bandaged 
foot, was limping as he walked around the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
And to cap off the Padres' latest excursion into the baseball world, Roberto 
Alomar was telling reporters that he no longer wants to play shortstop, hoping 
that the Padres make a trade to acquire one so that he can remain at second. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are in one fine mess, and the only real difference between this day 
and any other is that they let a national television audience in on their 
misery, losing, 8-4, to the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 10th loss to the Pirates in 11 games, but so what? Welcome to the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres (37-46) have lost four consecutive games and 15 of their past 18, 
dropping into the depths of the National League West. Not since they resumed 
playing after the 1981 strike -- and lost 17 of 20 -- have the Padres been in 
such a prolonged losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
They are playing so poorly that Manager Greg Riddoch not only held a 10-minute 
clubhouse meeting after the game but said he was planning to keep the players 
around for a practice session at Three Rivers Stadium, too. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, those plans went awry when the Pirates told him that the groundskeepers 
were paid by the city and that it would cost the Padres $2,000 to keep them 
working overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps first baseman Jack Clark summed up the Padres' affairs best when he 
returned to his locker after the game, took a look at the baseball shoes in his 
locker and snapped at one of the clubhouse boys: 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, can't you do a better job polishing these things? We look bad enough 
as it is. We don't need your help looking any worse." 
</P>
<P>
No sir, the Padres are doing just fine embarrassing themselves with their own 
play, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
The only aberration Saturday was that the Padres actually had a lead for the 
first time in 37 innings when Joe Carter hit a three-run homer in the third to 
make it 4-3, giving him more RBIs in one swing than he had in his previous 67 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
But the illusion that they might win vanished two innings later when their 
biggest nemesis, Barry Bonds, led off the sixth with a homer to tie it, setting 
the stage for their eighth-inning comedy act. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe this stuff that's happening?" Padre catcher Mark Parent said. 
"I see it every damn day, but I still can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Entering the eighth, the Padres were still tied at 4 apiece, which was a 
strange enough phenomenon these days, but they soon took care of that. Let's 
see, we had . . . 
</P>
<P>
Roberts -- who led off the inning with an infield single -- standing on second 
base and Alomar on first. Two outs. Phil Stephenson in the batter's box. That's 
when Roberts decided he'd try to distract pitcher Ted Power by feinting toward 
third, as if he were going to steal. Oops. The only guy he faked out was 
Alomar, who ran toward second thinking it was a double steal. Roberts was stuck 
in no-man's land, then tagged out in a rundown. 
</P>
<P>
"I was already on second base, and then I heard the crowd make a noise," Alomar 
said. "I looked up, and Bip was coming back to second. I said, 'What's going 
on?' What a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Said Roberts: "I didn't give a sign. I didn't even look at Robbie. He wasn't 
supposed to be running. I was just trying to make something happen. I tried to 
be too creative, and I got burned." 
</P>
<P>
The fun was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the inning, Pirate second baseman Jose Lind singled to center 
with Jeff King on first. But instead of stopping at second, King took off for 
third. Center fielder Shawn Abner, appearing confused, didn't know which base 
to throw to and ended up firing it between second and third. Alomar watched the 
ball bounce past him, and Lind took second as King reached third. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were forced to load the bases by intentionally walking Wally 
Backman, and pinch-hitter R.J. Reynolds made them pay the price by hitting a 
single to right off reliever Greg Harris, scoring two runs. Reynolds then stole 
second and kept running all of the way home on Sid Bream's routine single to 
right, resulting in two more runs. Right fielder Tony Gwynn's throw into the 
infield was much too casual, and when Roberts caught the ball, he looked toward 
home too late. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just not thinking out there," Riddoch said. "We're just having too many 
mental breakdowns." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have enough trouble just trying to win with all of their physical 
problems, but when they commit the mental blunders, it's as if the Bad News 
Bears are facing the Oakland A's. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how much ability you have," Padre outfielder Fred Lynn said, "you 
have to have a fundamental basic concept of the game. You shouldn't have to 
teach players the game once they get here, but what are you going to do? If you 
don't know the game, you've got to teach them." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch, well-aware of the team's fundamental flaws, was hoping to help rectify 
that with a mid-season spring training, if you will. Instead, it has rained the 
past three days in Pittsburgh, leaving the field unavailable for use before 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those things will come," Parent said, "but the one thing we need more 
than anything else right now is to just beat the crap out of somebody. You 
can't be aggressive just once in a while. You've got to be aggressive all of 
the time, and we're not doing that. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lead, and we're just sitting on it. We've got to go out there like 
kamikaze-style. We've got to beat somebody for nine solid innings and work from 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Riddoch, who's still looking for his first victory as a major league 
manager after three opportunities: "I still believe in these guys, I really do. 
And I believe at some point there will be a reward for going through all the 
stuff we have. But it's not going to be coming to the door. We're going to have 
to work through it." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the offense could use a whole lot of work. The Padres are hitting 
just .210 these past two weeks, scoring three or fewer runs in 12 of the past 
14 games. Saturday, they were able to collect just six hits against Bob Walk 
and Ted Power, each of whom was making his first appearance since coming off 
the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
But now, of all times, the Padres might be without the use of their 
power-hitter, Carter, and leadoff hitter, Roberts, for a few games. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's left foot slammed into the outfield wall in the second inning as he 
tried to chase down a double hit by Gary Redus. He played four more innings 
afterward -- and hit his home run -- but in the sixth, he told Riddoch that he 
would be a detriment defensively and left the game. Carter was diagnosed as 
having turf toe, and his status is day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll play if I can," Carter said, "but I won't be doing anybody any good if I 
can't go full-speed." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, meanwhile, is suffering from a possible abscessed wisdom tooth, and he 
said the pain is worsening by the day. He was planning to have oral surgery 
when the Padres return home in a week, but now thinks that perhaps he should 
have it done as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's killing me, it's just killing me," Roberts said. "It hurts to even talk. 
I've got to see what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
And just when Riddoch didn't think his problems could possibly expand, Alomar 
proclaimed after the game that he doesn't care for this idea of playing a 
couple of days a week at shortstop in place of Garry Templeton. He wants to 
stay at second, at which he was selected to the All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play better, I think, if I stay at second," he said. "At least I'm 
already established at second base. Who knows what will happen at short? I say, 
'Make a trade, and go get another shortstop.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's too hard to me to get used to playing there just one day here and day 
there." 
</P>
<P>
And that's the way it was for Game No. 83. A couple of injuries here. A 
dissatisfied player there. And mental mistakes everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
When your starting pitcher, Bruce Hurst, strikes out a batter, Walk, for the 
third out in the second inning, but the ball bounces off the plate to the 
backstop, allowing one run to score while setting up another, you just know 
it's not going to be your day. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball's a crazy game, isn't it?" said Hurst, who left after the sixth with 
a no-decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, though, have a way of making it seem eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pirate left fielder Barry Bonds continued his personal assault on the Padre 
pitching staff Saturday, hitting a game-tying home run and drawing two walks. 
He owns a career .476 batting average (10 for 21) against Bruce Hurst, with two 
homers; is hitting .463 (19 for 41) against the Padres this season, with six 
homers and 15 RBIs, and leads the Pirates with a career .354 batting average 
against the Padres with 12 homers and 30 RBIs. . . . Hurst, on the fact that he 
has three hits in his past eight at-bats, including a single Saturday: "I guess 
you could say I'm hitting better than I'm pitching. . . . Pirate starter Walt 
Terrell, who signed a three-year, $3.6-million contract as a free agent in the 
off-season, was assigned Saturday to the Pirates' triple-A team in Buffalo. 
Terrell, who pitched most of last season with the Padres, has three days to 
accept the assignment. If he refuses, he becomes a free agent, and any team can 
claim him for $100,000 while the Pirates are required to eat the rest of the 
contract. "It's doubtful he'll accept it," Pirate General Manager Larry Doughty 
said. "We've talked to a few teams, but there's minimal interest." . . . The 
Pirates (52-32) had not been 20 games above .500 since the end of the 1979 
season, when they were 98-64.

A CHAIN REACTION OF COLLEGE EXPANSION EVENTS SWEEPS NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN MURRAY, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some administrators look at the state of college athletics -- at the deficit 
spending, the spiraling costs, the rampant uncertainty -- and see chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Lengyel, athletic director at Navy, looks at all of the above and sees a 
glass that is half-filled with opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"What better time than now?" Lengyel asked. "When you look around at the 
possibility for change, it's a great time, a great opportunity to make 
effective and important decisions about athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take great leadership. But things are not as bad as (the skeptics) 
paint it." 
</P>
<P>
Change is just around the corner for college athletics. As administrators 
across the country wrestle with grim financial reports, the search for 
solutions has brought us to the dawning of the age of the super conference, if 
you believe recent speculation. By the year 2001, you could expect to see the 
following headlines in college football: 
</P>
<P>
Penn State dumps Nebraska in divisional playoff for Big Ten title 
</P>
<P>
Boston College outlasts South Carolina to win ACC playoff 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, Florida State advance to Division I championship game 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2001, you could see five "super conferences" composed of 12 to 16 
schools, with each conference negotiating its own network TV contract. You 
could see a national playoff that would retain, to some degree, the bowl 
system. You could see the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
administering its rules and regulations to schools in Divisions II and III 
only. 
</P>
<P>
Call it the Big Bang. It already has started. 
</P>
<P>
The first cataclysmic blast was heard last December, when Penn State gave up 
independent status in football to join the Big Ten Conference. The next was 
heard in February, when Notre Dame bolted from the College Football 
Association's five-year television package and negotiated its own TV deal. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, a chain reaction of expansion events has swept across the land. The 
Southeastern Conference formally invited Florida State, Miami and Arkansas to 
climb aboard. The once-formidable Southwest Conference, with only two major TV 
markets, quickly huddled with the Big Eight Conference to talk about 
consolidation. The Metro Conference wants to add football to its other sports 
schedules. And the Atlantic Coast Conference, after voting not to expand, had 
to rethink its stance as the SEC tried to move into its territory. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of all this discussion is economics, particularly as it relates to 
football. In an attempt to become self-sufficient, athletic departments have 
had to find new ways of coming up with revenue. The bottom line on college 
athletic budgets has been written in red. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes back to the perception that intercollegiate programs are fat, and 
that's not true," said Lew Perkins, outgoing athletic director of the 
University of Maryland. "Michigan lost $2.5 million, Stanford had to cut back 
30 track scholarships. The cost of doing business is getting out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
The problem at Maryland has been even more acute. While trying to bring the 
budget in line, Perkins' successor will have to deal with the loss of some $3 
million because of recent NCAA basketball sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent College Football Association financial survey shows that the 
cost of running a major college program has gone up 34 percent the last four 
years, while income is up only 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Tarman, athletic director at Penn State, played down the financial 
implications of the move to the Big Ten, yet admitted that it was a hedge 
against the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep reading we did it for money," Tarman said. "I'm not sure we'll be 
further ahead financially. Our feeling was, maybe it's best for us in the 
decade ahead, and the next century, to be part of a group that will get into 
revenue-sharing. Who knows what the future holds? This is a built-in assurance 
(of solvency)." 
</P>
<P>
All football independents, including Navy, watched the historic Penn State move 
closely because it could be the start of a trend. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody goes to a conference, we have to be concerned where we fit," 
Lengyel said. "We've attempted to talk to all the conferences so we're aware of 
what's happening. We want to be able to make an intelligent decision, not a 
crisis decision. If the CFA goes down and there's no consortium for revenues, 
we might have to look at a conference." 
</P>
<P>
The health -- and wealth -- of the CFA is another part of the equation. The 
Federal Trade Commission is investigating antitrust claims against the CFA's 
network TV contracts. If the CFA package is ruled in violation of antitrust 
law, five major conferences (ACC, SEC, SWC, Big Eight, Western Athletic 
Conference) could be without a national TV deal. 
</P>
<P>
The CFA is heading into the fourth and final year of a $134 million contract 
with CBS and ESPN. The new contract, with ABC and ESPN, begins in 1991 and is 
worth $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
The CFA was formed in 1983 when 63 big-time programs decided to break from the 
NCAA's TV package. At that point, the Big Ten and Pac-10 started negotiating 
their own TV deal. 
</P>
<P>
Of the rampant speculation about super conferences, CFA Executive Director 
Chuck Neinas said, "It's economically driven. I think television has served as 
a smoke screen for other economic issues. I think there are some cases where 
some institutions are trying to get a change in their conference financial 
structure. Some are concerned about carrying a heavier financial burden and not 
being compensated, that some lesser institutions are taking more from the 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Haines, executive vice president for Raycom Sports in Charlotte, N.C., is 
among those who expect a new look for college athletics. The Metro Conference 
asked Raycom last January to conduct a feasibility study on expansion. The two 
proposals selected by the league were for a 16-team football conference and a 
12-team all-sports conference. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-school super conference would be comprised of the eight Metro schools; 
Big East schools Syracuse, Pitt and Boston College; Atlantic 10 schools West 
Virginia, Rutgers and Temple; and independents Miami and East Carolina. Four 
schools -- Syracuse, Boston College, Pitt and East Carolina -- are not 
interested in an all-sports conference. Miami, meanwhile, said it is interested 
only in an all-sports affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is interest in it," Haines said of the Metro's super conference plan. 
"Whether or not some southern schools are able to overcome the attractiveness 
of the ACC or SEC remains to be seen. The super conference makes a lot of 
sense, looking at the future. You're talking about TV households that measure 
between 35 and 40 percent of the country. There are a lot of reasons why it 
ought to take place. We expect to know in 30 days." 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody agrees with the concept, though. Bruce Skinner, former executive 
director for the Fiesta Bowl, does not think the idea will fly once 
administrators look at it more closely. 
</P>
<P>
"If a super conference is formed, somebody's got to go 1-10," Skinner said. 
"And if you have a bunch of (traditional) 10-1 teams, somebody's got to go 6-5, 
and that will lessen attendance. For financial reasons, it won't happen."

<P>
While everybody was looking for the next cover of the Wheaties box, Prague-born 
and Texas-saved Martina Navratilova just may have become that purest of hearts, 
a genuine American sports champion. At 33 years old, on a weakened left knee, 
she dreams in slang and plays tennis in her sleep, legs twitching and her arm 
flying around until somebody shakes her and she starts awake as she exclaims, 
"I won the point." 
</P>
<P>
Complicated in nature, with a face drawn by two rulers that gets only more 
interesting as she goes on, Navratilova still is making statements. Ever since 
she left her patience and her family in Czechoslovakia in 1975, she alternately 
has confused and enlightened with her ability and lifestyle, and hardly ever 
gained acceptance for either. But when she won her ninth Wimbledon singles 
title last weekend, taking sole possession of the record she shared with Helen 
Wills Moody, she slipped over the wall into immortality and clarified 
everything for herself, with no asterisks or qualifications or doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"If I get hurt or if I never win another tennis match, I'll retire a happy 
woman," she said. "There are no more buts." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova sat in a small house just yards from the All England Club one 
morning after her victory and at the end of a painstaking odyssey to rediscover 
her game and herself. 
</P>
<P>
She was so beset with doubt 14 months ago she considered retiring. The period 
since has been what friend and mentor Billie Jean King described as "an 
unbelievable emotional confrontation." Not the least of it was her shattering 
return to Prague in May, a visit that was triumphant, despairing, and finally 
conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
She fumbled with a jar of instant coffee while friend Judy Nelson made pasta, 
coach Craig Kardon milled around and Nelson's son, Bales, teased her 
affectionately. Then she closed a door and settled quietly at a table filled 
with a jumble of flowers and her Wimbledon trophy. A replica of the permanent 
one, it is about as big as a dessert plate. Unimpressive by itself perhaps, but 
breathtaking in the scope of all of them, won from 1978 to Saturday, when she 
defeated Zina Garrison, 6-4, 6-1, on Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends say I should go for a set of 12," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
Who has ever won nine of any one thing? Not Joe DiMaggio, not Joe Montana, not 
Jack Nicklaus. Maybe Notre Dame. As she toyed with it, certainly the greatest 
player in Wimbledon annals and probably the greatest woman player ever, all the 
elements of a remarkably divided athlete and life seemed resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm content that I did everything I wanted, and so much more," she said. 
"Because I wanted it so badly, I'd have felt my career wasn't complete. How 
much more I win can't change what I feel right now." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova is as American as you are, maybe more so. She likes Fred Astaire 
and Katharine Hepburn movies, art deco, kids, football, golf, Texas and 
Colorado. She hates taxes. 
</P>
<P>
She has made a longtime home in Fort Worth, and plans to live the rest of her 
life in Aspen, where she owns a large tract of land, several horses, including 
one named Grand Slam, two cats and five dogs. She plans to stay in tennis at 
least through 1992, because one of her last ambitions is to play for the U.S. 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
She always has winced at the word defector, because it implies a sort of 
treason instead of a choice. Nor does it convey the satisfaction she felt on 
becoming a U.S. citizen in 1981. She regards herself as an immigrant, no less 
American than Jennifer Capriati, Andre Agassi and Michael Chang, immigrants' 
children all. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more American than most people born there," she said. "People ask me, 
'Where is your home?' I'm an American. Everybody is a transplant, whether first 
generation or 10th. I made it my home by choice. So I earned my Americanism. 
Financially, I'd have been better off in Monaco." 
</P>
<P>
There are few remaining traces of exoticism in her looks or behavior. In street 
clothes she is surprisingly average, 5 feet 7 and trimly proportioned, just a 
size 8. "I'm smaller than they think," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In conversations over the last couple of months she was alternately funny, 
aware, and frighteningly intelligent. Comments such as Margaret Court's, that 
she is not an appropriate role model for young tennis players, are brushed 
aside. She has a quick laugh and a generous streak reflected in a movie-star 
quality smile that seems to compose her features. She is an appallingly free 
spender, and a rank sentimentalist who weeps at television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"People still think I'm harder than I am," she said. "I'm a softie. I can also 
be a real bitch. But for the most part I'm a reasonable person." 
</P>
<P>
She actually is quite striking -- photos rarely doing her justice, catching the 
shadows and planes and not the clean, straight lines and hazel, almond-shaped 
eyes. "I think I have a strong face I'm still growing into," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She apparently looks very much like her natural father. Her parents divorced 
when she was 3, and at 10 she changed her name from Subertova to that of her 
adoptive father, Navratil. At 23, she learned her natural father had committed 
suicide, leaving only a few vague memories and a lot of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm told I'm a lot like him," she said. "But I don't know what that means." 
</P>
<P>
She is a meticulous user of the dictionary. She is a member of the Sierra Club. 
She reads several newspapers and follows politics compulsively, an avowed 
liberal. "Politics is life," she said recently. "We all better be interested." 
She has a magnificent propensity for self-denial and procrastination. She is 
opinionated, relentlessly frank, self-congratulatory. She wears her every 
emotion in her eyes, mouth and the turn of her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell it like it is, like it or not," she said. "I'm honest. That's American, 
isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
There is a saying about left-handers, that they hit away from their hearts. It 
seems a fair description of Navratilova's ruthless athleticism, an instinctive 
trajectory toward the net so deep-seated she can't remember her first volley. 
"I always did it," she said. "I just always did." 
</P>
<P>
Her flaw is said to be her fragile psyche. She won 17 Grand Slam titles with 
her head who knows where, maybe on the score of a baseball game or flight of a 
sparrow. So the first thing King said when Navratilova turned to her 
plaintively 14 months ago was that if she was going to win a ninth Wimbledon 
and 18th Grand Slam title, her head had to catch up to her body. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had that label that if I won it was because I was talented and if I 
lost it was because I choked," Navratilova said. "I don't know if I deserved it 
or not, but that's what we worked on, the head." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova's temperament perhaps results from her uncanny vision, both 
literally and generally. She sees everything while on the court, minor 
movements from the flick of a cigarette to a head peeping over a fence. She 
also sees a broad spectrum, lacking the dumb focus and tunnel vision of most 
multiple champions. That temperament unraveled when the field caught up to her 
in 1987, no longer the fastest or the strongest, surpassed physically and in 
the rankings by a teen-ager, Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
She was worn out, unhappy and beatable. After a series of demoralizing losses 
she called King, whose first advice was to turn off the phone, lock the door 
and take a week off. "I got a suntan on my stomach for the first time in 16 
years," she said. Then King sat her down and told her a few incontrovertible 
truths. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her that she had always been a physical champion, and if she wanted to 
win again she was going to have to get much tougher emotionally and mentally," 
King said. 
</P>
<P>
They held head sessions in the kitchen, not all of them friendly. At the same 
time, Navratilova embarked on one of the most grim physical-training regimens 
of her career. "When the doubts came I got on the bicycle and pedaled harder," 
she said. The effort culminated with a three-week session on grass courts in 
Hilton Head, S.C., five hours a day, Kardon and King fining her a dollar for 
every complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"I was learning to confront," Navratilova said. "I'm a procrastinator when it 
comes to conflict. I confronted confronting. I used to keep things inside. Now 
I talk about them." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Navratilova is stronger internally, only she knows. Anyone who has won 
18 Grand Slam titles has a strong defense against the label of choking. 
Navratilova suggests that the tag may have come from her long rivalry with 
durable Chris Evert, who made her opponents pale in comparison. Navratilova's 
first Wimbledon title came over Evert in 1978, 2-6, 6-4, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
"Next to Chris, everyone looked less tough," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova assuredly is a more complete, determined player than she has ever 
been. "She can coach now," King said. "A year ago she couldn't. The game is 
much clearer to her." She won a rain-interrupted Wimbledon tuneup in 
Eastbourne, England, with a telling performance that may have been harder than 
Wimbledon: In one day she won quarterfinal and semifinal singles matches and 
also a doubles match, seven sets of tennis with two tiebreakers that left her 
heaving and soaking in a bath. 
</P>
<P>
It does not mean that Navratilova is any less prey to pressures. Against 
Garrison she won a bout with one of the worst cases of nerves she ever has 
experienced. The burden of winning rested squarely on her shoulders. As she sat 
panicking in the locker room before the final, Evert came in. Now retired and 
commentating for NBC-TV, Evert had a cluster of notes in her hand. Navratilova 
asked to see them. Evert had written that Navratilova should be a heavy 
favorite, but if the match became close, "she's been known to get tight under 
pressure." Navratilova nodded. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was admitting it," Navratilova said. "I can talk about it; that's 
the difference. I was scared of losing, I was scared of everything. But I won 
it." 
</P>
<P>
If Navratilova has confronted anything about herself it is a lingering sense of 
victimization. It struck her with a vengeance in May when she visited Prague, a 
city of ruined beauty and soaring spires, for the first time since the 
Communist regime fell. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wrenching," she said. "I guess because it's a free country now you're 
allowed to feel more." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova grew up in Revnice, a dusty village of red tiled roofs a half-hour 
from the city. There is a ramshackle tennis club with a few beat-up wooden 
lockers, where just recently a poster of Navratilova sprang onto the wall, for 
years forbidden because of her status as a non-person. Nearby there is a lone 
abandoned court surrounded by hanging tree limbs where she used to play with 
her adoptive father, when they weren't hunting mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
It was only her second visit since she left in 1975, her first coming as a 
member of the U.S. Federation Cup team in 1986, when she moved only within a 
smothering cordon of security. This time in Revnice they threw the block party 
to end all block parties, a family and neighborhood reunion. She visited her 
natural father's grave, and for the first time, that of her grandmother, who 
died when she was exiled in Dallas and unable to return for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
She caught a glimpse of Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel in a Prague 
restaurant. He saw her and waved her inside. He told her he read a black-market 
copy of her autobiography; she told him he should quit smoking. Havel asked her 
to address an election rally for Civic Forum, where she was greeted by a wild 
throng that exploded into roars when she said, "It's nice to be a person 
again." She told Kardon and Judy Nelson, "That's the biggest rush I ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova returned to Aspen ecstatic and in a spectacular fit of denial. A 
few days later she was stricken by a series of headaches and stomach heaves. 
Two doctors pronounced her physically fine. "Have you seen an analyst?" one 
asked. She went on a crying jag. 
</P>
<P>
"Some real serious emotional things came up," she said. "A lot of baggage from 
Czechoslovakia. My parents. My grandmother's death. There was just a lot of 
sorrow, and it all came out. I cried my heart out. Now I can talk about it 
without crying. There's sadness, but there are good spirits too. It's not just 
despair." 
</P>
<P>
There are some things Navratilova has perhaps not entirely come to terms with, 
such as how vast the lonesomeness was in 1976 after she defected, months of 
nagging injuries and no news from Czechoslovakia. When it was suggested during 
Wimbledon that her generation of players may have had fewer pressures than 
today's, she snapped: "I was totally alone. I mean alone. Cut off from my 
family, friends. If you want to call that easy, go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
But overall there is a new balance in Navratilova that she gained even before 
Wimbledon. She calls it peace of mind. "I had to have that to win," she said. 
"The peace came from all the work I had done." There is a subtle shift of 
emphasis, her self-esteem results less from her won-lost record than it does 
from what went into it. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past couple of years, when she felt so totally lost, it was like, just 
hold your breath and go out and hope," Nelson said. "This was a confidence that 
she could walk away proud, win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
What Navratilova seeks now is a greater concert between her talent and her 
mentality, and perhaps a U.S. Open title in September that could give her the 
No. 1 ranking for the first time since '87. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to win in the U.S," she said. It is not inconceivable, nor is a 10th 
Wimbledon, since the All England Club is perhaps her most enduring, welcoming 
abode. "I know I have a place here," she said. At 33, her knees aching but her 
ambition refreshed, with no intention of quitting, she sat gazing at a little 
silver plate and tried to put words to the feeling of completeness. 
</P>
<P>
"I always said I'd play tennis until I'm 30 and then I'd see," she said. "I'm 
still seeing."

OVERFELT LEADS GLENDALE TO 2 WINS OVER SUN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITTORIO TAFUR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brent Overfelt, receiving his first starting pitching assignment of the season, 
led Glendale to a 6-4 American Legion District 20 Eastern Division victory over 
Sun Valley on Saturday in the second game of a doubleheader to give Glendale a 
sweep at Poly High. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, Overfelt drove in John Aguilar with a double to tie the score, 
2-2, in the fifth inning and scored on a passed ball in Glendale's 3-2 victory. 
Overfelt (4-1) walked none and struck out seven in the next game, but he did 
not allow a hit until Robert Aros singled with none out in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale right-hander had expected to start the second game in right field. 
But when scheduled starter Manny Fernandez arrived late, Overfelt was given the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
He said he fulfilled a seasonlong desire by starting on the mound at least once 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale finished the regular season at 18-5, a half-game behind first-place 
Sun Valley (18-4). Panorama City, which won two games against Van Nuys-Notre 
Dame on Saturday, is 17-5. Sun Valley and Panorama City have one game 
remaining. The top two teams in the division advance to the playoffs. There 
also will be two wildcard berths. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Valley is scheduled to play a makeup game against Verdugo Hills today at 9 
a.m. at Poly High. Panorama City will play Verdugo Hills in a makeup game 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going to happen is I have one of the best teams around and I'm probably 
going to go in the playoffs as a wildcard," said Glendale Coach Mike MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale enjoyed a 6-0 lead in the second game, but Sun Valley struck back in 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Overfelt carried a two-hitter into the seventh, but was knocked out after 
issuing three walks and two hits as Sun Valley closed to 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Asselin replaced Overfelt with none out and the bases loaded and struck 
out the first batter. 
</P>
<P>
He then gave up a two-run single to Sun Valley pitcher Marlon McKinney, but he 
ended the game by striking out Robert Flores and retiring Roy Lozano on a weak 
grounder to second.

HEAT STUNG BY LATE SALT LAKE CITY GOAL, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Goalkeeper Mike Littman pounded a hairbrush in anger against the wall of the 
steamy locker room at West Torrance High Friday night. Perspiration flowed from 
his forehead and frustration poured from his heart. 
</P>
<P>
"We work hard for 90 minutes and then we give up a stupid goal like that." he 
said after the Heat dropped a 2-1 decision to the Salt Lake Sting on a 
last-second goal. "I don't know what it is with this team. It's some kind of 
lapse. It's so frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
In a scenario that is becoming painfully familiar, the Heat (7-7) dominated 
another American Professional Soccer League West opponent and lost. L.A. 
outshot Salt Lake City, 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, to win games you have to put the ball in the back of the 
net," Littman said. "We didn't do that and I feel like I lost the game for us 
because I gave up two goals. But I can't do it all." 
</P>
<P>
Littman was not to blame. The Sting grabbed a 1-0 lead 31:25 into the game when 
a George Pastor shot glanced off the leg of Heat defender Thor Lee and 
deflected away from a well-positioned Littman. The Heat tied the game on a 
header by Pena at the left post 23:02 into the second half after a nice cross 
by J.B. Frost. 
</P>
<P>
Then with no time left on the scoreboard clock (in the APSL, the official time 
is kept on the field and the scoreboard clock is purely informational), the 
Heat defense went to sleep. Former Palos Verdes High football and soccer 
standout Dominic Militello, working against Lee, who had been hobbled earlier 
with a sprained ankle, made a nifty pass into the flat about 40 yards out. 
Dzung Tran took the ball down the right sideline and passed ahead to Derek 
Sanderson, who was clear as he turned to the goal. Sanderson drove toward 
Littman, then dumped a pass in front of the net to Pastor, who beat his 
defender and then the Heat goalie for the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize that Lee was hurt that bad," Militello said. "We were just 
trying to get the ball wide to Tran and work the wings, maybe get a one-on-one 
situation and, fortunately, it worked." 
</P>
<P>
Lee injured his left ankle late in the game taking a ball away from an 
opponent. But because the Heat had used its two substitutes, he had to remain 
on the field or the Heat would have had to play one down. An adept defender, 
Lee could barely walk off the field when the game ended.

AREA SOCCER TEAMS WILL COMPETE IN INTERNATIONAL EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley Premier and the California Heat of Woodland Hills will 
represent the Valley area this week in the USA Cup 1990, the largest 
international soccer tournament in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Premier, for players aged 14 years and under, and the Heat, for players 12 
and under, will join 406 other teams from more than 25 states and 17 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Play begins Monday in the National Sports Center in Blaine, Minn., and each 
team is guaranteed four games in round-robin play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very unique experience for kids this age to travel out to an 
international competition," said Premier manager Roger Alves. The team went 
20-0-4 in El Camino League play this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Premier is an advanced-level traveling team. The Heat is an American Youth 
Soccer Assn. club team. 
</P>
<P>
"The team got together two years ago," Heat manager Jennifer Witcher said. "We 
are not an all-star team and the people at the USA Cup assured me it was 
friendly competition. We won't be losing, 20-0." 
</P>
<P>
The Heat spent five days each in Washington, D.C., Virginia and Philadelphia en 
route to Blaine. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an educational trip," Witcher said. "Soccer gave us the opportunity."

<P>
NEW COACHING JOB HELPS CARSON BOUNCE BACK FROM HEARTBREAK AT HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The coincidence was not lost on Dave Carson. As the former coach at Hart and 
Burbank highs busily prepared for a new life in Spokane, Wash., he took note of 
where his career stood one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Carson accepted his new job as a track and assistant football coach at Rogers 
High almost exactly a year after he was forced to resign as the Hart football 
coach. Principal Laurence Strauss claimed Carson ran a negative program and the 
coach's resignation July 20, 1989 ended a turbulent tour of duty with one of 
the area's top programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians were 6-5 under Carson and failed to win the Foothill League title 
for the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, 42, had built a reputation as a talented coach in his five years at 
Burbank, fielding respectable if not especially talented teams. His 27-25 
record included six forfeit losses. 
</P>
<P>
But one season after he replaced Rick Scott at Hart, Carson was stunned by his 
ouster, which caused him to sink into self-doubt and depression. He remained at 
Hart as a physical education teacher, but without a coaching job he felt like 
an outcast. 
</P>
<P>
"I was as low as you can get," he said Friday. "The people at Burbank respected 
me but the people at Hart never really got to know me. When you're treated as a 
nonentity, that's a tough pill to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubted myself and asked myself a lot of questions. I questioned what I did 
and who I was. I was always able to teach kids, but I didn't teach the Hart 
kids very much." 
</P>
<P>
Taking an assistant coaching position at Muir High in Pasadena helped restore 
Carson's confidence. He was hired in May as a defensive coordinator and enjoyed 
his brief ride with the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Muir kids took to me like a duck to water. I worked with quality kids 
there and was having fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson took the job in Spokane because of his friendship with football Coach 
Jeff Reyburn. The two worked together on Dave Currey's staff at Cal State Long 
Beach in 1977-78. A visit to the area last month clinched the deal for Carson, 
who will move north by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great place to raise a family and we're all excited about leaving," he 
said. "If you told me a year ago that I'd be packing for a job in Washington 
that I was really excited about, I wouldn't have believed it." 
</P>
<P>
Reclamation project: Perhaps the biggest boon to the young career of Canoga 
Park point guard Lindsey Dunbar came last winter with one week left in the 
regular season. The Hunters had shown tremendous improvement in Jeff Davis' 
first season as coach, but the prospect of a losing season irked Dunbar. Canoga 
Park finished with a 10-13 record and Dunbar finished in the Davis doghouse. 
</P>
<P>
Davis kicked Dunbar off the team after they clashed during practice. Dunbar, a 
5-foot-7 junior point guard, was the team's leading playmaker with an average 
of 6.3 assists a game and was second in scoring with a 12.2-point average. But 
he had lessons to learn that went beyond the playbook, a fact he now readily 
admits. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be selfish and just wanted to score," Dunbar said. "(Davis) changed 
everything. I have a team attitude now and like to play with the team. Now I'm 
glad he kicked me off. He made me a better ballplayer and a person. I learned 
discipline from him." 
</P>
<P>
Davis claims that the change will make Dunbar one of the top players in the 
area next season. Dunbar has averaged 20 points in summer league games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's real tough to guard and now he understands the game better," Davis said. 
"He's learned to listen better. He understands the necessary communication 
between a coach and a point guard during the game. He looks over to the bench 
and he didn't do that before." 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar claims his case is instructive. Davis has brought a winning attitude to 
a program that had seemed ready for the trash heap. In the season before Davis 
arrived, the Hunters lost a Northwest Valley Conference game to Cleveland by 97 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a winning attitude now and it's been fun," Dunbar said. "He has 
everything to do with it. He's a good coach and good motivator." 
</P>
<P>
Add Canoga Park: Davis has kept the Hunters busy this summer, taking them to 
out-of-town tournaments two weekends in a row. After a trip to Santa Barbara 
for a tournament at Westmont College, the team played in the 32-team event at 
Skyline College in the Bay Area last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunters dropped two of three games in the Bay Area and had to sleep on a 
high school gym floor their first night on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't let us stay at the college but it turned out to be a good 
thing," David said. "We stayed up real late, just sitting around talking. It 
was like a campfire thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We had another long talk the next night and I could feel the team getting real 
close. That's why these trips are so beneficial."

Indian Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh offered to resign after three 
Cabinet ministers quit to protest an incident they claimed violated his pledge 
to restore honesty to government. 
</P>
<P>
But S.R. Bommai, president of Singh's Janata Dal party, played down fears that 
the eight-month-old coalition government might collapse. He told a news 
conference that he refused to accept the resignation. The Cabinet ministers 
resigned after Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, a powerful peasant leader from 
Haryana state, had his son elected as state chief minister.

Rebels stopped three buses and gunned down at least 35 Muslim passengers in 
eastern Sri Lanka, Defense Ministry officials in Colombo said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry officials said the rebels stopped the buses near the town of 
Kalmunai. Muslim politicians put the number of dead at 150. According to 
residents of Kalmunai, the killings were intended as a warning to Muslims not 
to help soldiers hunt for hide-outs of Tamil rebels, who are fighting for an 
independent state in northeastern St Lanka. Meanwhile, a Tamil politician 
claimed Sri Lankan soldiers massacred nearly 1,000 Tamil civilians during the 
last month of fighting with the rebels.

A protester living in a tent outside the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., 
where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, got a two-day 
reprieve from a court-ordered eviction because sheriff's deputies do not do 
that kind of work on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Smith, 39, has camped near the motel since March, 1988, in an effort 
to stop the state from converting it into the Lorraine National Civil Rights 
Museum. She maintains that King's memory would be better served by establishing 
a shelter for the homeless or a free clinic. A county court judge had ordered 
Smith out by noon Friday, but a crowd of about 200 supporters gathered and 
cheered when she refused to leave.

SWITCH IN POWER PUTS DWP ON A NEW ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The team of environmentalists appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley to head the city's 
giant Department of Water and Power plans to champion an activist agenda 
ranging from a ban on new coal-fired power plants to tree planting to improving 
air quality. 
</P>
<P>
The new commissioners, led by Bradley's former chief deputy Michael Gage, say 
they will pull the DWP out of a major fossil fuel-burning power project in 
Utah, now on the drawing boards, and instead invest in solar, wind and 
geothermal energy. 
</P>
<P>
Handpicked by Bradley to become president of the DWP Board of Commissioners 
later this month, Gage said he envisions that much of the city's future power 
needs will be satisfied through greater conservation and construction of mini, 
cogeneration power facilities owned by private companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The DWP is the best-run department in the city," said Gage in an interview. 
"But like any organization, it has its blind spots. They'll be getting more in 
touch now. The dialogue has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Some commissioners and analysts see Gage's agenda as everything from benign 
environmentalist platitudes to a dangerous direction that could jeopardize the 
city's water and power supplies. 
</P>
<P>
A few City Council members say they support many of the individual goals but 
are concerned that the positions are too strident. "You cannot totally 
eliminate your current reliable energy source (coal) from your future 
planning," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Caruso, the current DWP board president, said he hopes the new appointees 
will soon "have a better appreciation of what the DWP has done" and will change 
little at the nation's largest municipally owned utility. 
</P>
<P>
He fears that the appointees, facing confirmation this month, have not "shown 
their true colors" and may be harboring an even more sweeping agenda. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Bradley appointed Gage, a self-styled environmentalist, and Dorothy 
Green, of the environmentalist group Heal the Bay. 
</P>
<P>
To form a three-vote environmentalist majority on the five-member board, 
Bradley two weeks ago nominated Mary Nichols, senior staff attorney with the 
Natural Resources Defense Council. Her appointment was approved by a City 
Council committee last week and she awaits confirmation by the full council. 
</P>
<P>
Caruso, an attorney and real estate developer who has been at odds with Gage, 
said some of the new plans, such as abandoning the option of new coal plants, 
are "unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
"Those types of decisions can cost us a lot of money," said Caruso. "To say we 
are not going to do it, period, puts the city in jeopardy. I don't think he 
knows what he is talking about." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members are also growing increasingly skeptical as the new 
environmental agenda unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
"You should look at this as a well-run department and not come in there and 
think that you're going to change the whole course of it," council President 
John Ferraro cautioned commission nominee Nichols at her recent confirmation 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
One financial analyst expressed concern that Bradley wants to turn the 
$3-billion utility into what the mayor called an "environmental trend-setter." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been well-documented that when politics play a role in utilities, it can 
cause severe problems," said John Costagliola, assistant vice president and 
primary DWP analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., one of the nation's two 
most influential credit rating agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Gage insists his plans won't lead to increased water or electric rates in Los 
Angeles -- now among the state's lowest -- or affect supplies. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Gage said that the alternative energy sources he wants pursued 
will cost less in the long and short runs. Gage said alternative sources, such 
as wind, "once were thought to be flaky. Now they are seen as efficient." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Green said that seemingly small conservation measures could save 
DWP money. "Just by using more efficient light bulbs (citywide) we could 
eliminate the need for a new power plant," Green said. She was unable to cite 
figures to back up the assertion. 
</P>
<P>
Utility analyst Costagliola said many energy innovations have been 
disappointing to disastrous for other utilities. "To be dependent on them is 
not prudent utility practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gage maintains that -- when future costs of cleaning up pollution from 
coal-fired plants are considered -- wind, solar and geothermal are more 
economical energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we have a responsibility to remove some of the (pollutants) we put into the 
air?" Gage said. "The answer is yes." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 50% of the DWP's energy comes from coal-fired plants, 20% from 
oil and gas burning facilities, 10% from nuclear generation, 10% from 
hydroelectric and 10% is purchased from other utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 1% of the DWP's power comes from the alternative sources being 
championed by Gage. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think most of this is 'out there,' " he said. "Most of this has been 
around for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Caruso said that some alternative energy sources have been 
explored, but are not feasible on a large scale. Others worked and are already 
incorporated in DWP's programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
DWP has spent millions of dollars experimenting with solar and geothermal 
energy over the last 10 years and found both to be troublesome, expensive and 
unreliable, officials said. One geothermal plant, for instance, was an 
efficient provider of power, but the liquids in the hot springs were so 
corrosive that engineers "couldn't keep pipes in the ground," said Dennis B. 
Whitney, assistant engineer of systems development. 
</P>
<P>
The department has another geothermal project on the boards and has spent $15 
million on its development, Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
DWP also spends $4.5 million a year on solar power development, and in the 
mid-1980s, operated an experimental solar-powered house in the San Fernando 
Valley. So far, the technology is not efficient enough for commercial use, 
Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
A test of Gage's agenda, which is endorsed by the mayor, may come soon. The DWP 
is seeking 600 megawatts of additional energy by 1995 -- enough to handle 
projected population growth through the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
On the water side of the DWP, Gage's agenda generally is less controversial 
than on the power side. 
</P>
<P>
Gage wants the department to do a better job on water conservation and to pay 
farmers to use more efficient irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
But his position on the use of Mono Lake water clashes with that of DWP 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Gage says he wants to "negotiate, rather than litigate" to find a solution to 
the lawsuits brought by environmentalists who allege that DWP is destroying the 
lake's fragile ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
Caruso said the department recently was close to settling the dispute, after 
seven years of negotiations, but the agreement was scuttled when commission 
nominees inadvertently gave environmentalists hope of getting a better deal 
with the new board. 
</P>
<P>
Gage said that "the discussions have gotten substantially more serious" since 
he and Green joined the board.

TIMELESS TINSEL;

FOR THE TOURISTS, HOLLYWOOD STILL HAS ITS GLITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
New York tourist Marianne Muraca was puzzled when a stranger stopped her on 
Hollywood Boulevard and handed her a long-stemmed yellow rose. 
</P>
<P>
A few steps away, a guitarist was softly strumming a flamenco tune beneath a 
colorful, wall-sized portrait of silent movie actress Dolores Del Rio. 
Onlookers were nibbling on grapes, melon slices and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Muraca was just as surprised by what happened next. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Woo stepped forward to tell those gathered at 
the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Hudson Avenue on Thursday that the new 
$27,000 Del Rio mural was another step toward sprucing up Hollywood's tacky, 
tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives residents as well as tourists something to look at," said Woo, who 
represents Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Fingering her rose and glancing at her surroundings, Muraca confided that the 
Movie Capital of the World didn't look all that bad to her. 
</P>
<P>
The sidewalk known throughout the world as the Walk of Fame was filled with 
people. The boulevard throbbed with excitement. The sun was shining and the sky 
was blue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like New York City -- only cleaner," Muraca said. 
</P>
<P>
"And more elegant," added her companion, Long Island resident Brian Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's main street is dismissed by many in Los Angeles as Hollyweird 
Boulevard -- home of degenerate rock 'n' rollers, runaway kids, panhandlers and 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are convinced that Hollywood's decline is more than cosmetic, 
however. Four years ago they launched a $922-million redevelopment effort to 
improve the area's mix of businesses, theaters and visitor accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
The comments of critics notwithstanding, Hollywood Boulevard still seems to 
glitter for most tourists flocking there this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I disappointed? Not at all!" exclaimed visitor Tina Harris of Vancouver, 
Canada, as she gleefully compared her handprints with those of Marilyn Monroe 
in the concrete courtyard of Mann's Chinese Theatre on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, other tourists crowded around barricades to watch a promotion stunt 
being staged by Warner Bros. for the new Bill Murray comedy, "Quick Change." A 
few visitors were picked from the crowd to climb into costumes to re-create a 
bank robbery scene in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Glover, a visitor from Edinburgh, Scotland, was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best place I've ever been too," Glover said after he finished. 
"Everything here is brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
At a Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau office a few blocks down the 
boulevard, Denver visitor Bill Baldwin examined a rack of brochures for 
Hollywood tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood is not as bad as I thought it would be," he said. "I thought I'd see 
more druggies and prostitutes, more litter on the streets, more panhandlers and 
more run-down buildings. But I haven't. Either the media has overdrawn the 
negativism of the area, or it's on the rebound." 
</P>
<P>
Back out on the boulevard, self-styled Hollywood street person Dan Tanner voted 
for the rebound theory. 
</P>
<P>
In the "six years, off and on," that he has lived on the streets, Tanner, 22, 
says he has seen police crackdowns on loitering, the demolition of notorious 
transient crash pads and a general cleanup of litter and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
He and his buddies have learned to keep moving when they are strolling the 
boulevard in their torn jeans, studded leather jackets and spiked hair, said 
Tanner, who grew up in Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner sports a blue-and-black striped Mohawk haircut and wears eight rings on 
his ears, tongue and other parts of his body. His appearance has made him a 
Hollywood tourist attraction of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
"People from out of town freak out when they see me. Tourists come up all the 
time and ask if they can take my picture," he said. "I say sure, for a dollar. 
It's better than bumming." 
</P>
<P>
As if on cue, visitor Mireya Gaxiola of Mexicali, Mexico, shyly tapped Tanner 
on the shoulder and asked if she could have her photo taken standing next to 
him. A few flash shots and one greenback later, the deal was done. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists say they are not surprised that genuine celebrities never seem to 
actually walk on the Walk of Fame that bears their names. But in a pinch, 
Hollywood can live up to its reputation as a town of make-believe, discovered 
visitor Tammy Strohl of Palmertown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Strohl was waiting in line at a boulevard tourist shop called "Pose With Stars" 
to have a $10 photograph taken of her standing next to a cardboard cutout of 
her favorite entertainer, Dolly Parton. The shop's walls were covered with 
life-sized head-and-shoulders portraits of such entertainers as Elizabeth 
Taylor, Sylvester Stallone and musician Jon Bon Jovi. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to see stars," Strohl laughed. "And here they are. All of them." 
</P>
<P>
Back at bigger-than-life Dolores Del Rio, visitor Scott DeSantis of Bound 
Brook, N.J., admired the mural. "I'll probably see more stars back in New 
Jersey than I'll see out here," he said. "But I'm not at all disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
After the speeches ended, the civic leaders lingered to discuss among 
themselves future Hollywood improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
Woo listened politely as boulevard shopkeeper Mariam Hejazi buttonholed him to 
complain that the litter problem is out of control in front of her store. "The 
whole world looks at Hollywood. But when you look at it, it's really dirty," 
Hejazi asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce President Larry Kaplan -- whose organization 
represents many of the 1,200 businesses along the Walk of Fame -- was also 
fretting over tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is they don't stay long enough to spend money," Kaplan said. "They 
pop a quarter in the meter, look over the stars on the sidewalk and the 
footprints over at Mann's and they're out of here." 
</P>
<P>
The one face in the crowd that seemed unconcerned was that of Del Rio, which 
gazed demurely toward Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder. City officials said muralist Alfredo de Batuc has protected her with 
a special anti-graffiti covering.

<P>
ARSON: SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAYS BLAZE WAS DELIBERATELY SET. RESIDENTS AND 
CAMPERS ARE FORCED TO EVACUATE AS FIRE BURNS OUT OF CONTROL NEAR SANTA CLARITA. 
</P>

<P>
A fast-moving brush fire that within five hours had blackened more than 1,000 
acres was burning out of control Saturday night in the rugged Angeles National 
Forest northeast of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported that the fire had been 
deliberately set. The U.S. Forest Service is continuing the investigation, but 
investigators said they had no leads as to the arsonist's identity. The fire, 
which broke out shortly before 2:30 p.m. in the upper Bouquet Canyon area, 
forced the evacuation of residents from more than 50 homes, weekend cabins and 
campgrounds scattered throughout the canyon. Officials said about 60 families 
left the canyon, but none showed up at Red Cross evacuation centers set up as a 
precaution at Saugus High School in the Santa Clarita Valley and at Quartz Hill 
High School in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fire continued to burn out of control firefighters believed they 
had gained the upper hand as night fell and winds that had reached 30 m.p.h. 
began to die down. Authorities said they expect to have the fire contained by 6 
p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
No homes were damaged, but a storage shed was destroyed, firefighters said, and 
the flames were coming perilously close to other structures, prompting the 
evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main objective is to build a line to protect those houses," said Bruce 
Bundick, U.S. Forest Service spokesman. "If everything goes well, we think we 
can do that." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Rafael Ortiz said the fire started 
in two places on Bouquet Canyon Road near the Texas Canyon ranger station and 
then merged as it burned. The road was later closed between Spunky Canyon Road 
and Vasquez Canyon Road, a 10-mile stretch, and had not reopened even to 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had not determined the cause of the blaze, but arson investigators 
were at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The Bouquet Canyon blaze comes as firefighters and residents continued mopping 
up after a series of fires that have plagued the Southland in recent weeks, 
including a devastating inferno in Santa Barbara that burned hundreds of homes, 
causing upward of $300 million in damage, and another in Glendale that 
destroyed 46 homes and damaged more than 20 others. 
</P>
<P>
About 450 firefighters from the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Department of 
Forestry and the Los Angeles County and Ventura County fire departments were 
battling the rapidly moving blaze in the steep-walled canyon, which was burning 
northeast toward the Bouquet Canyon Reservoir, Bundick said. Four firefighters 
suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Many people in the area refused to comply with the voluntary evacuation sought 
by fire officials. 
</P>

Dave Foley, who owns a carpet store in Saugus, said when he heard about the 
fire he rushed to his single-story weekend home in the canyon. He began using 
an electric water pump to draft water from a nearby creek and doused his roof 
with water, but when the electricity went off the pump stopped. He then filled 
buckets with stream water and carried them up a ladder to the roof. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of people have the gasoline pumps," he said, referring to other 
canyon residents. "I'm going to get one." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Thompson of Sylmar said he was ordered to evacuate his weekend cabin after 
the fire burned within a couple of hundred yards of the structure. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see it jumping all around," he said. "They're doing a pretty good job. I 
think they're going to get it out." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Crane and his fiance, Tammy Lyon, said they saw one of the fires 
shortly after it started about a mile north of the Texas Canyon ranger station 
as they were driving toward the Big Oaks Lodge, a restaurant and bar in Bouquet 
Canyon owned by Crane's aunt, Dee White. 
</P>
<P>
Crane said that after he saw the fire, he turned around and drove back to the 
Texas Canyon Ranger Station to report it. He happened to have his camera with 
him and took pictures of the blaze. He said he has turned the film over to 
arson investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Crane, Lyon and White grabbed the cash register, pictures and boxes of whiskey 
and beer from the lodge and loaded them into a truck, ready to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
But by 6:30 p.m., they sat at a picnic table in front of the lodge sipping 
fruit and tomato juice as five fire-fighting helicopters doused the flames in 
the distance. Earlier, Crane had scaled the roof to water it down with a hose. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ordered to evacuate a couple of times, but we're not leaving," Crane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Big Oaks Lodge, a fixture in the canyon since the turn of the 
century, suffered a fire in January of this year and just reopened this month. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the fire burned several hundred yards from the lodge.

NEW POLITBURO DROPS KREMLIN'S KEY MINISTERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Communist Party, withdrawing further from direct, day-to-day 
management of the nation and its economy, elected a new Politburo on Saturday 
that excludes, for the first time, the head of the country's government as well 
as its key ministers. 
</P>
<P>
The move, which is likely to prove one of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's most 
important reforms, will end, symbolically and practically, the party's 
determined use of the state to enhance its own power as well as to implement 
its policies. 
</P>
<P>
Those excluded from the new Politburo included Prime Minister Nikolai I. 
Ryzhkov and Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, the 
national legislature. The ministers of foreign affairs, defense and economic 
planning, who had been members, were also dropped, as was the chairman of the 
State Security Committee, the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
"This serves to emphasize that the party is breaking completely with the past 
practice when it was totally incorporated into the command-and-administer 
system and was at the top of the bureaucracy," Ivan T. Frolov, the editor of 
the Communist Party newspaper Pravda, said after the elections by the party's 
new policy-making Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the party will be competing with other social and political forces and 
seeking to establish its predominance mostly through an ideological and 
political struggle," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the party's most powerful figures, the new 24-member Politburo 
includes, for the first time, all the Communist Party leaders from the Soviet 
Union's 15 constituent republics in an effort to bind their parties closer to 
the center by giving them a voice in Moscow's decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Gorbachev and Vladimir A. Ivashko, his deputy as the party's 
general secretary, the Politburo also includes -- on Gorbachev's nomination -- 
the party officials in charge of international relations, ideology, 
agricultural and industrial policies and Frolov, as the editor of the party 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Galina V. Semyonova, the editor of the magazine Peasant Woman, became the first 
woman elected to full membership in the party's ruling body. She was named to 
take charge of the "feminist movement," a party spokesman said. "You see, she's 
a woman, and that's the way it is." The old Politburo had a woman as a party 
secretary, and a woman served as an alternate, non-voting member in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The Politburo's political balance is "firmly center-left," another party 
official commented. While Ivashko, Moscow party leader Yuri A. Prokofiev, and 
agriculture chief Yegor S. Stroyev are regarded as moderate reformers, others 
such as Frolov and Alexander S. Dzasokhov, the new ideology secretary, are seen 
as well to the left. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the appointments, the official Soviet news agency Tass commented: 
"This is the first time that no one from the Soviet government or the Soviet 
Parliament's (executive) presidium joined the Politburo. This reflects the 
Communist Party's course of separating the party from state authority." 
</P>
<P>
During the Communist Party's 73 years in power, the state had become one of the 
primary motors in its "construction of socialism." Although Karl Marx had 
theorized that the state would "wither away" under socialism, the party turned 
it into a major instrument in implementing its policies, and in less than a 
decade the state was effectively subordinated to the party apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
The party's new, 412-member policy-making Central Committee, which itself was 
elected only Friday at the end of a lengthy party congress, also elected 11 
party secretaries, most of whom will be full-time headquarters officials. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, five "members of the Secretariat," including a farmer, a factory 
hand, a weaver and two local party officials, were appointed to the Politburo 
to ensure that authentic grass-roots voices are heard in the top leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The old Politburo had 12 full members and seven non-voting, alternate members, 
all but one Moscow-based officials, and there were 13 Central Committee 
secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Ivashko, the former party leader in the Ukraine, are the only old 
Politburo members to retain their posts in the new body. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the previous Politburo members, in fact, remain in the Council of 
Ministers, the Presidential Council or other governmental bodies. Among them 
are Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, 
economic planning chief Yuri D. Maslyukov, KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov 
and Alexander N. Yakovlev and Yevgeny M. Primakov -- two of Gorbachev's closest 
political advisers. 
</P>
<P>
But other prominent members of the old Politburo, most notably the conservative 
standard-bearer Yegor K. Ligachev and ideologist Vadim A. Medvedev, were simply 
forced into retirement by the increasingly rough-and-tumble politics here. 
</P>
<P>
Editor Frolov said these changes had been hotly debated by the new Central 
Committee, which met late into the night Friday and then resumed its 
deliberations Saturday morning in the Kremlin for several more hours before 
reaching an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"The plain fact is that we have never done it this way, and the change is real, 
far-reaching and quite profound," Frolov said. "Many members of the Central 
Committee wanted to know why Ryzhkov, for example, was not included, or 
Lukyanov. Why these other people, some of whom are not well known? 
</P>
<P>
"The debate also continues quite sharply in the party about power, political 
power, and how it should be won, how it should be used and how it should be 
retained. That is a debate about what kind of party we are, what kind of 
society we want. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Not all like our decision, which was made some time ago, for the party to 
stick to politics and end the command-and-administer system through which we 
tried to run the whole country from top down, that is from the Politburo." 
</P>
<P>
The move, although part of the broad democratic reforms undertaken by 
Gorbachev, will paradoxically strengthen his position by restricting the new 
Politburo to party matters and transferring many of its previous functions to 
his Presidential Council, which has emerged as the country's top policy-making 
body. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, moreover, no longer is responsible to a committee of his party peers 
-- people who had proposed his appointment, whose views must be heeded and who 
could, perhaps, force him out. 
</P>
<P>
The new Politburo, filled with so many representatives of such disparate 
interests, meeting only once a month and depending on a core leadership of 
officials loyal to Gorbachev for much of its direction, appears unlikely to 
curb Gorbachev or to hold him to account.

CREWS WORK TO SHORE UP RAIL TUNNEL; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE: ENGINEERS HOPE TO REOPEN DOWNTOWN SECTION OF THE HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY BY 
MONDAY. THE BLAZE BELOW IS STILL SMOLDERING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As fire smoldered for a second day in an unfinished downtown Los Angeles 
subway, engineers struggled Saturday to shore up the gutted underground tunnel 
in hopes of reopening the Hollywood Freeway by Monday morning's rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
State engineers visually inspected the freeway above the burned-out Metro Rail 
tunnel and judged it to be structurally sound. The roadway -- one of Los 
Angeles' most heavily traveled arteries -- was closed early Friday amid fears 
that the partially collapsed tunnel underneath it would cave in. 
</P>
<P>
Officials cautioned that the freeway, part of U.S. 101, will not be reopened 
until workers finish building braces designed to prevent the tunnel from caving 
in further. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying very hard to see if we can open up the freeway by Monday 
morning," said Steve Leung, traffic systems chief for Caltrans. A decision is 
not expected until tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The separate, elevated El Monte busway that runs alongside the freeway will be 
opened to auto traffic on Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said Saturday that they have found no evidence of arson but are 
continuing to investigate what caused the fire to erupt in an uncompleted 
section of tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said a crew may have been working with welding equipment several hours 
before the fire. Earlier this year, a small fire in the same tunnel complex was 
caused by sparks from welding, according to Metro Rail officials. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, about 43 hours after the fire began, it continued to smolder in 
a 200-foot southern section of the tunnel. Firefighters decided to let the fire 
burn itself out. 
</P>
<P>
When the northern end of the tunnel cooled down and was deemed safe to enter, 
repair work began beneath the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Enduring stifling heat, construction workers erected 12-foot sections of 
aluminum scaffolding to shore up a 250-foot portion of the charred tunnel. 
Wooden timbers and steel beams were added to hold the tunnel roof in place. 
</P>
<P>
It was a painstakingly slow process. By Saturday night, only a short section of 
the tunnel had been shored up by a small crew that worked methodically. An 
ambulance and four rescuers waited nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The construction is a temporary, emergency measure designed to strengthen the 
tunnel so it will withstand the weight of freeway traffic above, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire tunnel will have to be reconstructed," said Al Perdon, assistant 
general manager for the Southern California Rapid Transit District. "What we 
are building right now is a temporary structure to allow traffic to be restored 
to the freeway. . . . (The tunnel is) a big hole in the ground that has been 
burned out." 
</P>
<P>
Perdon said the enormous steel bands that encircle the tunnel were distorted 
and twisted by the heat, but retained their strength. 
</P>
<P>
The section of tunnel beneath the freeway, he said, did not cave in because 
soil surrounding it had been injected with chemical grout that bonded the dirt. 
Grouting was not used along the section of tunnel that collapsed because it 
runs beneath a largely deserted maintenance yard, Perdon said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials emphasized that the safety of construction crews and potential 
motorists would not be compromised. They added that they want to complete the 
repair work as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get this freeway open," an engineer close to the project said. 
"That's everybody's major concern." 
</P>
<P>
The stretch of freeway that is closed, a segment known as "the slot" between 
Mission Street and the four-level interchange, averages 210,000 vehicles a day 
and is a principal link into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're targeting for Monday, but we're not going to push the workers," Perdon 
said. "Our first concern is safety. . . . If we can open the freeway Monday, we 
will. If we can't, then we won't." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Roper, deputy director of Caltrans, said that if the freeway is not 
reopened on Monday, the elevated, single-lane busway will be used for all 
traffic, buses and cars. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials, discounting speculation that the blaze was started by 
transients, said in a news conference Saturday that investigators have not 
found evidence of arson. They said the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing that we have right now would lead us to believe that it's an arson 
fire," city Deputy Fire Chief Reynaldo Rojo said. "It's very slow. . . . Arson 
work is detective work." 
</P>
<P>
No one was working in the tunnel when the fire erupted about 1:50 a.m. Friday, 
officials said. A crew in an adjacent tunnel discovered the fire and escaped 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to interviewing that crew, investigators said they plan to talk 
with members of another crew that had been working earlier in the tunnel that 
burned. This crew had finished its shift hours before the fire erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Sources told The Times that the crew may have been working with welders while 
installing a plastic lining used to keep toxic fumes out of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a small fire in the same tunnel complex was caused by sparks 
from welding, according to Metro Rail officials. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Ford, the Metro Rail's senior engineer for construction safety, said on 
Friday that a "very small fire" earlier this year in the same tunnel complex 
was started "as a result of a welding operation." 
</P>
<P>
In that case, he said, the embers smoldered for awhile before bursting into 
flames, even though workers had followed proper safety procedures and washed 
the welded area with water to extinguish any sparks after they finished work. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "there was no operation during the day (Thursday) that could 
account for this fire." 
</P>
<P>
Other sources said that workers who finished their shift late Thursday 
afternoon had been installing the plastic liner that blocks gases and moisture 
from entering the tunnel. As part of that work, the sources said, some welding 
does occur. 
</P>
<P>
Fire and Metro Rail officials said there was no indication of what caused the 
fire, whether it was welding or some other source. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a team working on this asking all these questions," said Neil 
Peterson, executive director of the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission. LACTC took over management of Metro Rail from the RTD last week. 
</P>
<P>
The fire represented the most serious setback to construction of the 
$1.4-billion, 4.4-mile Metro Rail subway system, a project already months 
behind schedule and millions of dollars over budget. But officials downplayed 
any effect the damage to the tunnel would have on the start-up date of the 
subway system. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel that burned will not be for passenger traffic, but will be used to 
carry empty trains between Union Station and a maintenance yard beside the Los 
Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
The smoke that billowed from the tunnel was moderately toxic. Scientists at the 
Air Quality Management District who monitored it said the levels of chromium 
and arsenic late Friday reached 20 times the safety exposure levels prescribed 
by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the levels have droped off to well below permitted levels, said 
AQMD spokesman Tom Eichorn. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the fire early Friday, flames had engulfed nearly 750 feet of 
the tunnel, which runs from Union Station, under the Hollywood Freeway and to a 
maintenance yard at the intersection of Center and Commercial streets. Several 
hours into the fire, a middle portion of the tunnel, about 150 feet long, caved 
in, dividing the tunnel into northern and southern sections. 
</P>
<P>
Fire in the northern section was extinguished Friday afternoon. Fire continued 
to smolder at the southern end of the tunnel Saturday evening. Smoke floated 
out of the blackened tunnel's portals, and twisted metal was visible. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically it's out, but it's still smoldering," Battalion Chief Tom Curry 
said as he surveyed the site. "There are little pockets of fire down in there." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters worked to pump out chocolate-colored water. But they did not 
venture inside the tunnel, in part out of fear that the burning sections might 
yet collapse. Instead, they kept vigil outside the southern mouth of the tunnel 
to prevent the fire from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Fire Chief Rojo said the fire, limited mostly to heavy, slow-burning 
timbers that line the tunnel, would burn itself out. "There is no reason for us 
to risk anyone's life," he said. 
</P>

Repairing The Tunnel 
</P>
<P>
Temporary repairs to shore up 250 feet of the Metro Rail tunnel under the 
Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
1. The damage 
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed the wood timbers between the steel ribs. The wood is 
completely gone. The goal of the repair effort now under way is to shore up the 
tunnel to prevent future collapse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2. Temporary repairs 
</P>
<P>
In the center of the tunnel, a 12 foot by 12 foot aluminum brace (with diagonal 
cross bracing) will be installed every 1.5 feet down the tunnel. Steel beams 
will be placed on top of the aluminum braces. And large wood timbers will be 
installed above that to hold the dirt lining of the tunnel in place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steel ribs and timber lagging, installed in four-foot sections, support the 
circumference of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
12-inch-thick concrete liners are used as the finished construction surface. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 1/8-inch-thick, high-density polyethylene plastic liner is used on the inside 
walls to protect against methane gas seepage

E. GERMAN IRE PERILS FUTURE OF SOVIET ARMY

JUETERBOG, East Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political graffiti of any kind are a rarity in newly democratic East Germany, 
but the words on a crumbling stucco wall in this Soviet garrison town are in a 
class all their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Russians Out!" someone has scrawled in red, and added a swastika for good 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
The swastika, according to townspeople, is most likely the work of skinheads 
who tumble out of the town's single discotheque at closing time and, in recent 
weeks, have been harassing solitary Soviet soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
But the message seems to capture a quieter, broader kind of anger that has 
spread across much of East Germany, carrying with it the elements of a 
political time bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Exhausted by the relentless late-night comings and goings of jet fighters at 
the air base just west of town, annoyed by the roar of Red Army truck convoys 
moving through town, and unsettled by stories of ground-water pollution, the 
people of Jueterbog have become increasingly open in their hostility toward the 
Soviet military presence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not hate, but it can come to that," Juergen Tolksdorf, the town's chief 
administrative officer, told a recent visitor. "It was always a forced 
friendship." 
</P>
<P>
Rainer Eppelmann, the East German minister for disarmament and defense, 
referred to this growing tension the other day in Parliament. He said there is 
"a very large problem with major political ramifications." 
</P>
<P>
Any significant anti-Soviet unrest here would likely weaken Moscow's attempt to 
keep a military foothold in East Germany for a prolonged period after 
unification with West Germany. And it would just as likely add to the 
resentment of Soviet military leaders who already feel betrayed by the loss of 
Eastern Europe and provide a potentially dangerous dimension to the difficult 
German-Soviet relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Eppelmann called for speedy agreement on a timetable for the withdrawal of 
Soviet forces, but many political and military analysts estimate that even if 
there is early agreement, it will be three to five years, at least, before all 
the Soviets are gone. 
</P>
<P>
The revolutions that swept Eastern Europe last fall have brought down abuse on 
Soviet forces throughout the region, but the scale of the problem in East 
Germany is of a higher order. 
</P>
<P>
About 360,000 troops -- three-fourths of the Soviet force in Eastern Europe -- 
are crowded into East Germany. The task of transporting them home, coupled with 
the need to provide jobs and housing for them, would make for slow going even 
if Moscow agreed to an early withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, the presence of Soviet troops is hotly 
discussed but felt only occasionally at the personal level. In East Germany, 
Soviet military vehicles fill the streets, Soviet officers' wives compete with 
other homemakers for bread and meat, and shoddy Soviet military bases mar the 
landscape. According to one Western estimate, Soviet training areas take up 20% 
of East Germany's land. 
</P>
<P>
The area around Jueterbog, a 12th-Century town of about 15,000 people engaged 
in food canning, light manufacturing and other pursuits, has long been used for 
military training. But the Soviets have made it something different. People say 
the noise of aircraft, which often goes on until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, 
is ruining their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Andreas Tessmer, a teacher whose school is near the end of the air base's main 
runway, recently complained to the local newspaper about his students' nervous 
reaction. Others are more specific. 
</P>
<P>
"You go to a funeral, where people are already upset, and you can't hear a 
thing that's said," lamented Inge Fuhr, who administers the office of county 
government leader Siegfried Jausch. 
</P>
<P>
An active local ecology movement, spawned by last November's revolution, has 
raised questions about the indiscriminate dumping of aviation fuel and the 
resultant ground-water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Jausch said in an interview that he has appealed to senior Soviet officers to 
restrict training flights to daylight hours and to route military traffic 
around the town, but that so far they have taken no action. 
</P>
<P>
The level of public anger is a measure of how dramatically expectations in East 
Germany have changed since the peaceful revolution there last year. 
</P>
<P>
Only a year ago, the people of Jueterbog were resigned to accepting as 
inevitable the things they are now fighting so strenuously. In 1987, when a 
Soviet trainee left his tank across the tracks on the main rail line north of 
town and caused a crash that left several people dead, there was resentment but 
no protest. To protest was unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
But democracy, and the new view of the Soviets as neither needed nor wanted, 
has changed all that. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the tension has led to no more than minor incidents -- peaceful 
protests, a petition, some fistfights around a local disco and a simmering 
sense of ill will. German women are increasingly resentful of Soviet officers' 
wives. Since July 1, when the East German currency was replaced by the West 
German mark, the Soviet women have cleared the shelves of Western products and 
sent them all home. 
</P>
<P>
On May 22, a 17-year-old Soviet soldier waiting for a train was attacked by 
East German youths and beaten so severely that he was hospitalized. Soviet 
officers say harassment of their troops is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"Things have gotten worse," Slava Smolen, a young first lieutenant who came to 
Jueterbog four years ago, told a reporter. "Neo-fascist groups turn up (at his 
quarters) and shout every Friday and Saturday night. Once, they even smashed 
some windows." 
</P>
<P>
Jausch, the county official, said he is concerned that the mood could 
deteriorate, and quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Our requests, which have now become the demands of the public, can't be 
ignored further without political consequences that are in nobody's interests," 
he warned in a recent letter to Defense Minister Eppelmann. " . . . The 
bottled-up anger of the people can only get worse and lead even to violence." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, it is worse already. The commander at a Soviet air base near Cottbus 
avoided a potentially serious incident recently by disarming his troops when 
angry East German demonstrators protesting against noise and pollution hurled 
rocks and bottles over the base fence. 
</P>
<P>
There was a similar protest at a base near Neuruppin, 50 miles north of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Western observers who monitor the situation are pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dangerous game that's out of the politicians' hands," said Jochen Thies 
of the German Foreign Policy Assn. in Bonn. "My forecast is that there will be 
trouble later this year." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half a century of ignoring public concern has put the Soviet military at 
a distinct disadvantage in any attempt to win the people's support. The 
officers discourage contact with the people, and when men are found to have 
made friendships, they are soon transferred. 
</P>
<P>
People in Jueterbog say Soviet pilots take few pains to avoid flying low over 
residential areas, rattling windows and awakening sleepers. 
</P>
<P>
Training mistakes also cause problems. The protest at Neuruppin occurred four 
days after a Soviet pilot inadvertently dropped three bombs on a neighboring 
village. The bombs were not armed, and no one was hurt, but many people were 
unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
Tempers were not cooled by charges, as yet unconfirmed, that the Soviets have 
stored as much as 30,000 tons of material for chemical weapons in poorly 
maintained East German storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
There are emerging signs that the Soviet military may be preparing to act. 
According to Jausch, at a recent meeting, the deputy commander of the forces in 
and around Jueterbog indicated for the first time that he is willing to discuss 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
And Maj. Vassily Nisulov, a spokesman for Soviet military headquarters in East 
Germany, at Weunsdorf, south of Berlin, indicated that local commanders have 
been given permission to change training procedures to placate public protest. 
</P>
<P>
"There can't be a general order from here," he said in a telephone interview, 
"because our combat readiness must be maintained. Action must be taken in each 
specific case. We know about the problem, from local governments and from 
telephone calls from individuals throughout the country." 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Nisulov said, commanders will be punished if they are found to 
be polluting the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
It is not at all clear that this will be enough. But Col. Uwe Hempel, an East 
German army spokesman, observed, "They (the Soviets) must react positively if 
these problems are going to be cleared up in a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Tyler Marshall, based in West Berlin, was recently on 
assignment in Jueterbog.

THESE BLUE LINE RIDERS STILL SEE RED; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: THEY FONDLY REMEMBER THE DAYS OF THE RED CAR, WHEN LOS ANGELES -- AND 
THEY -- WERE YOUNG. 
</P>

<P>
The Blue Line may be an air-conditioned technological wonder, but it was having 
a tough time wrestling with the ghost of the Red Cars on Saturday as riders of 
Los Angeles' old transit system turned out to size up its new one. 
</P>
<P>
Finding someone to malign Mother Teresa might have been easier than eliciting a 
disparaging word about the old Pacific Electric Red Car that took its last 
mournful trip from Los Angeles to Long Beach, black flags waving, on April 9, 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
The trains clacked like thunder and the conductor had to throw sand on the 
tracks for traction. 
</P>
<P>
But memories were selective as Los Angeles residents fondly recalled a line 
where servicemen slept, riders fell in love and 34 cents would get you to the 
Santa Anita race track. It was more than another transit line, it was another 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy could go on there and go to sleep and nobody would rob you. Someone in 
the crowd would always wake you up to tell you when your stop was coming," said 
Tony Merriweather, who rode the Los Angeles-Long Beach route as an 18-year-old 
sailor in 1948. "Today, you can't speak to people. I drive by people all the 
time with their car doors half open and babies hanging out and you honk and 
they just speed up. Nobody talks to you." 
</P>
<P>
It's been 29 years since the last Red Car left Los Angeles with 50 people on 
board at 1 a.m. that April day in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"The passengers sang 'I've Been Workin' on the Railroad' and we arrived in Long 
Beach in the wee hours of the morning," said Alan Fishel, a transit buff who 
took the last ride at the age of 19 and waited in the heat Saturday for the 
debut of the Metro Blue Line. "We set out flares and watched the train roll 
away through the smoke and into the dawn. People cried, they really did." 
</P>
<P>
A few cars went to the museum; Los Angeles dove into its love affair with the 
automobile, and the Red Car faded from the public's memory. Lately, however, 
thousands of loyal followers have emerged with as many theories about the 
demise of what once was considered the nation's finest rail system. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real mad when they took away my Red Car," Bellflower resident Gene Bird 
grumbled. "And I know who did it -- Firestone tires, Standard Oil and General 
Motors. I've been buying Fords ever since." 
</P>
<P>
"It was the stupid Times Mirror Co.," said Ruby Deem of Alhambra, who used to 
ride the line to work at the phone company. Today, her old stop is a BMW 
dealership. "They never wrote a good word about the Red Car and that was the 
best system in the whole wide world." 
</P>
<P>
At 6:15 a.m. on July 4, 1902, 30,000 people came to town on horseback, bicycle 
and foot to see the Red Car take off from Los Angeles to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, almost 88 years later to the date, tens of thousands braved 
scorching heat, their heads covered with towels and handkerchiefs, to welcome 
not only the new Blue Line but the end of a Los Angeles transit standstill 
three decades long. 
</P>
<P>
The new line, like the old, runs from Los Angeles to Long Beach. And that, 
riders concluded, is where most similarities end. 
</P>
<P>
"This has more buttons than a 747," said Jim Deem, a former Red Car motorman 
who drove a Pasadena line in 1946 and sat for a moment behind the wheel of one 
of the sleek blue-and-white trains. 
</P>
<P>
The old trains were equipped with an air brake handle, an accelerator, a lever 
to spit sand on the tracks and a "dead man's switch" that stopped the car if 
the driver dropped dead. Untimely death and kids throwing rocks were about all 
the dangers Red Car drivers ever considered, Deem said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Line trains, on the other hand, are coated to resist graffiti, 
equipped with special alarm systems, patrolled by Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies and hooked up to a cement and glass command post known as the "USS 
Enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
Minimum fare on a Red Car was 10 cents, and provisions for senior citizens and 
the disabled weren't even considered. On the Blue Line, it's $1.10; seniors 
ride for half-fare and the blind ride free. 
</P>
<P>
The red line rolled through orange groves and alfalfa fields. The blue one 
offers a sobering view of some of the poorest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The old line was part of 1,100 miles of track that traversed four counties with 
access to the mountains and the sea. The Blue Line is the first leg of a system 
that, once finished, will stretch 150 miles -- paltry by comparison, most 
riders agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Blue Line will never replace the Red Car and all the memories it holds for 
me," said Merriweather, now an instructor supervisor for the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District, which runs the new rail. "The seats might be 
more comfortable now, but it was the clackety clack of the Red Car tracks that 
put me to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Reminiscence aside, Red Car loyalists vowed to ride the new line. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," said Gene Bird. "My nerves can't take the traffic. And the air -- 
I used to wake up in L.A. and see the clear blue skies and it felt good to be 
alive. Now, you feel like you're ready to let someone lay you down and bury 
you. It's been a long time coming."

SYRIA'S ASSAD VISITING EGYPT AFTER ICY DECADE; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: HE HOPES TO FORGE A NEW ARAB AXIS FOR NEGOTIATING REGIONAL PEACE. IT'S 
HIS FIRST TRIP TO CAIRO SINCE 1977.

<P>
Syrian President Hafez Assad arrived Saturday for his first visit to Egypt 
since the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, launching talks aimed at establishing 
Syria as an active negotiating partner to the Middle East conflict for the 
first time in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomats said Assad's summit with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would 
focus on repairing Syria's bitter rift with Iraq and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and in forging a new, united Arab axis for negotiating peace in 
Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Assad, a recluse who rarely travels outside Damascus, had not visited Egypt 
since former President Anwar Sadat's historic visit to Jerusalem in 1977. 
Flying directly to Alexandria from Damascus -- and bypassing Cairo, home of 
Israel's only embassy in the Arab world -- Assad embraced Mubarak to the sounds 
of a marching band and a 21-gun salute and also extended a warm handshake to 
the Iraqi and PLO ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
The summit was the fourth between Mubarak and Assad since Syria in December 
became the last Arab country to restore diplomatic relations with Egypt after 
the chilly years that followed implementation of the 1978 Camp David accords. 
</P>
<P>
The two presidents met behind closed doors for more than three hours and 
emerged without fully briefing their Cabinet ministers, who had assembled for 
separate talks, Egyptian Information Minister Safwat Sharif said. 
</P>
<P>
But Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources said the talks, if successful, could pave 
the way for bringing in the historically hard-line Syrian government as an 
active partner in the Middle East peace process and coalescing the feuding 
Syrian and Iraqi governments behind a permanent resolution to Lebanon's 
15-year-old civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has also become involved in a behind-the-scenes effort to 
reconcile Syria and Iraq before the next Arab League summit meeting in Cairo in 
November, Egyptian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is if we mobilize enough force behind it, maybe it will work out," 
said one official. 
</P>
<P>
The summit comes at a critical juncture in the Middle East, where peace efforts 
have been stymied by a new hard-line government in Israel, on the one hand, and 
the suspension of a dialogue between the United States and the PLO on the 
other. With the peace process at a standstill, Arab leaders are re-evaluating 
old rivalries in an attempt to forge a new, unified front against conflicts 
that have bedeviled the region for decades, several Western and Arab diplomats 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The change of heart in Israel toward extremism is pushing everybody to 
reconsider the situation," said one Egyptian official. 
</P>
<P>
Few were expecting immediate and dramatic movement from Syria, which has long 
scoffed at efforts to negotiate peace with Israel. Egyptians diplomats said 
they expected Assad would point to Israel's recent slowdown in efforts to set 
up a dialogue with Palestinians as an example of why the current peace process 
is doomed to fail. 
</P>
<P>
"Our argument will be that we better form a unified Arab stand if we're going 
to get anywhere," an Egyptian official countered. 
</P>
<P>
There also were some indications that Syria may be re-evaluating its relations 
with Iraq, governed by a rival wing of the Arab Baath Socialist Party, which 
were stormy for years and finally collapsed when Syria supported Iran in its 
eight-year-long war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"The day will come when matters will be straightened out and a reconciliation 
achieved between the two sister states (Syria and Iraq), but I can't predict 
when," Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh said in an interview with Egypt's 
state-owned Middle East News Agency. "It is natural that the two leaders will 
discuss ways of improving the Arab situation by deeds, not words . . . and of 
remedying the negative and developing the positive." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, there have been some signs of thawing relations between Syria and the 
PLO, which have been frozen since 1983, when PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat was 
expelled from Syria. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" the PLO's ambassador to Cairo, Said Kamel, said Saturday after 
shaking hands with Assad. "We are all looking for that, and we are struggling 
for that, because we are struggling for our national rights. We are calling 
always to have reconciliation with everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Assad has already said he would welcome Arafat in Damascus, but the PLO leader 
has so far demonstrated only lukewarm interest. An unidentified PLO official 
told the British news agency Reuters that Arafat might be amenable to a 
reconciliation but only if Assad agrees to free thousands of Palestinian 
prisoners held in Syrian jails and to release confiscated PLO funds and 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials and other Arab diplomats say Mubarak is hoping that, even if 
total reconciliation is impossible, enough ground can be covered to allow the 
Iraqi and Syrian leaders to meet productively at the upcoming Arab League 
summit meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, they said, bringing Syria, Iraq and the PLO into the peace process 
as partners is the only way to permanently resolve Mideast conflicts. Syria and 
Iraq are the main power brokers in Lebanon, for example, with Syria backing the 
government of Elias Hrawi against Iraqi support for the rival Christian Forces 
leader Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
Any permanent resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, they said, will have to 
determine the future of the Golan Heights as well, which Israel captured from 
Syria in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
One Egyptian official said the new push to reconcile Syria and Iraq follows 
indications that Aoun, entrenched against the Hrawi government in 
Christian-dominated East Beirut, may be willing at last to negotiate a 
settlement with Hrawi -- an opportunity that cannot be fully capitalized on 
unless Iraq and Syria are willing to act as partners to the process. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the Egyptians would like to see Damascus, Riyadh, Cairo and the PLO 
working as partners to resolve conflicts throughout the region, one source 
said.

QUEBEC INDIANS AGREE TO LIFT BRIDGE BLOCKADE

Armed Mohawk Indians embroiled in a land dispute with authorities agreed 
Saturday to lift a bridge blockade near Montreal after a provincial official 
promised to reduce the police contingent in this Quebec town. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was announced after Quebec Native Affairs Minister John Ciaccia 
met for more than six hours with Indian representatives in an effort to end the 
dispute, which has left one police officer dead. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting came as Indians guarded barricades at a reservation near Oka, 20 
miles west of Montreal, and blockaded the Mercier Bridge linking Montreal with 
its populous suburbs on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River. 
</P>
<P>
Ciaccia said the bridge blockade could be lifted as early as today. He refused 
to elaborate on the terms of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But Mohawk representative Ellen Gabriel said the Indians had agreed to reopen 
the bridge in return for a "significant reduction" of the police presence in 
Oka. 
</P>
<P>
Highways leading to the bridge were blockaded Wednesday by Mohawks of the 
Kahnawake reserve following an armed clash between provincial police and 
Mohawks guarding barricades on the reservation near Oka. 
</P>
<P>
The clash was sparked by the resort town's plans to extend a golf course onto 
Mohawk ancestral territory. 
</P>
<P>
A poll published Saturday showed that 53% of Montreal residents believe the 
Mohawks are right to defend their ancestral land. An overwhelming majority -- 
87% -- said the police should not attempt another confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Ciaccia said the talks Saturday resulted in the "beginnings of proposals" to 
end the Oka confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"You should all be very happy that we are announcing a solution for one very 
serious problem and the beginnings of a solution for the entire problem," he 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Ciaccia refused to elaborate on the proposals, saying he must first consult 
with the provincial government. He said he would return to Oka today to 
continue the talks. 
</P>
<P>
The police officer was killed in Wednesday's shoot-out with Mohawks guarding 
barricades. It is unclear if the officer was shot by Mohawks or fellow police.

PHILIPPINE GUERRILLAS SET TERMS FOR FREEING HOSTAGES;

TERRORISM: RELEASE OF A U.S. PEACE CORPS WORKER AND A JAPANESE CITIZEN HELD BY

Communist rebels said Saturday that they will release a kidnaped Peace Corps 
volunteer and a Japanese citizen to representatives of the International Red 
Cross "in the immediate future." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to retired Roman Catholic Bishop Antonio Fortich, who has been 
negotiating for the hostages' freedom, the rebels outlined the arrangements for 
the release of Timothy Swanson, 26, of Cheyenne, Wyo., and Fumio Mizuno, 36, of 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson was kidnaped June 13. His abduction was discovered by U.S. officials 
implementing an order from Washington to pull out 261 Peace Corps workers in 
the Philippines after rebels threatened to kill or kidnap the volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Mizuno, training director of the Tokyo-based Organization for Industrial, 
Spiritual and Cultural Advancement, was abducted May 29. 
</P>
<P>
Both hostages were seized from their homes on the island of Negros, 300 miles 
south of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said the two are "safe and sound." It did not set a date or place 
for their release, but negotiators said they expect them to be freed sometime 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also said the release should be carried out during a three-day 
cease-fire and should be witnessed by the Red Cross, the wives of the two 
hostages, doctors, human rights lawyers and members of the news media. 
Government soldiers must not be present, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by a rebel spokesman who identified himself as Celso 
Magsilang, was written on stationery marked with the logo of the Communist New 
People's Army. It was delivered to Fortich on Saturday afternoon by an NPA 
emissary. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels strongly denied statements by armed forces chief Gen. Renato de 
Villa that they had asked for a $217,000 ransom, and they warned the military 
against "sabotaging" the release. 
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the letter be aired over the radio for two days as a signal 
that their demands had been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
At least eight Americans have been killed since April, 1989, in slayings blamed 
on the 19,000-strong NPA. The guerrillas have vowed to kill more Americans 
unless Washington dismantles its military bases in the Philippines.

U.S. WOMAN GETS SKULL FRACTURE IN RUNNING OF BULLS

A 21-year-old American woman suffered a fractured skull in the running of the 
bulls Saturday, the final day of the weeklong San Fermin festival, a hospital 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Kern was in serious condition after she was knocked down by a bull 
during the run at the festival made famous by author Ernest Hemingway, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Kern, who will be a college senior in Conway, S.C., and her mother arrived in 
Pamplona on Wednesday. Kern is the first woman known to have been injured in 
the running of the bulls, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hannah Kern, of Clinchport, Va., said her daughter had been racing ahead of six 
bulls in a pack of people when the group suddenly surged forward. When she 
looked ahead to check her footing, a bull butted her with his head and caught 
her torso inside his horns. 
</P>
<P>
The force of the impact sent her sprawling headfirst onto the cobblestone 
street, Kern said. 
</P>
<P>
Five other people were treated at area hospitals after being less seriously 
injured during the 2 1/2-minute run with the bulls along the half-mile route 
from the corrals to the city bullring.

Members of the underclass sometimes do not seem to realize how different their 
lives are from those of the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Their inner-city neighborhoods are as isolated from middle America as the most 
remote and distant isle. Asked to tell about their lives, many of them reply 
matter-of-factly, naturally, without rancor, without embarrassment, without 
emotion, without self-pity. 
</P>
<P>
At the Robert Taylor Homes, one of the nation's most notorious public housing 
projects and the scene of more than one in 10 murders in Chicago, Willie Jean 
Nash, a heavyset, 30-year-old woman, talks about her five children. She and her 
youngest are taking part in a new preschool program at Beethoven Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The five children have two fathers, but Nash, who is supported by welfare, 
never married either man. She does not oppose marriage as an institution. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting for the right man," she says. "I'm waiting for someone who has a 
good job and is good to the kids, but they are hard to find." 
</P>
<P>
Many women in the ghetto say they have never had an abortion, but Nash is 
different. "I became pregnant when one of the little ones was just 2 months," 
she says. "So I had an abortion. I didn't like it. Now, I think five kids is 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Although she lacks a high school diploma, she says, "I want to be a nurse." 
When asked if she knows what kind of schooling she might need, she shrugs and 
shakes her head. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, social workers have a different perspective from most 
other Americans on poverty and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in her office at Grady Memorial Hospital here, Charlene Turner, a warm, 
open and assertive medical social worker, does not hesitate to say what is on 
her mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in a country as rich as the United States, we should not have people 
who are homeless," she says. "I think people who need work should get a job." 
</P>
<P>
She laughs and turns to hospital public relations officer James Driscoll: "Does 
that sound socialistic or something, Mr. Driscoll?" Without waiting for a 
reply, she adds: "We sort of think that nobody out there cares." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Dallas, a 6-foot-6 Atlanta police detective, played basketball at 
Cumberland College in Kentucky. Now he bemoans the lack of a Police Athletic 
League -- officers assigned to organize amateur sports leagues for youngsters 
and take them to watch professional baseball, football and basketball games for 
free. Atlanta once had such a group. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids got a chance to see the police in a positive role, as opposed to 
coming in and arresting one of their parents or chasing everybody off of the 
corner," Dallas says. But a budget problem a few years back forced the 
department to shift the officers from Athletic League duty to truancy duty. Now 
they hunt down students instead of taking them to ballgames. 
</P>
<P>
While driving through the Techwood public housing project, Dallas, who is 
black, is asked whether some of the kids playing basketball there might be 
pushers. He shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Your drug dealer doesn't play basketball," he says. "He's too busy. You are 
looking at boys who are looking for something to do. They are begging for 
things to do, but there's nothing for them to do." 
</P>
<P>
When the poor muse about their lot, they are puzzled as to what went wrong. 
Doris Pryor, 40, is technically homeless. She lives in a Lutheran Church 
transitional apartment in Washington, D.C., while hoping to find permanent 
housing. She is a quiet woman with a costume-jewelry sense of style, and she 
has decorated the doorway of her living room with a curtain of big, colorful 
beads that must be parted to enter. She lives with one of her four sons and two 
grandchildren, twin 5-year-old girls. 
</P>
<P>
She dropped out of the city's Cardozo High School in the 11th grade after her 
son was born 22 years ago. The young man is now in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pushing drugs," she says. "He didn't want to work. He wanted to live 
the fast life." He is the father of the twins. Their mother cannot care for 
them, Pryor says, because she is "strung out on drugs." Pryor won custody of 
her granddaughters because "they were abused by my oldest son, their father." 
</P>
<P>
As a school dropout, she could not cope with bringing up her first child. 
"Maybe if I was a little more for my oldest son," she says, "I could have done 
more. You see, my mother raised him until he was 16. He was a hot-headed son, 
so she took him off my hands to help me." 
</P>
<P>
The records of her other sons are spotty: One has a job with Wells Fargo, one 
is in a retreat for wayward boys in Florida and the youngest, a withdrawn 
14-year-old, is enrolled in special education. "The past is just like something 
I'm trying to forget," she says. "I'm trying to move ahead now." 
</P>
<P>
Jared Samples, a 21-year-old college graduate, grew up in the Perry Homes, a 
public housing project just outside Atlanta. He surprised the city by winning 
election to the council a few months ago. Though concerned that he is depriving 
the project of one of the few young blacks who can serve as a role model, he 
and his mother recently moved out of Perry Homes. 
</P>
<P>
Samples is the son of a minister who moved into Perry Homes 30 years ago, when 
such housing was made available to people of modest income who were not on the 
welfare rolls. He attributes his success to a strong family background. His 
father, who died in 1984, had a small disability pension from service in World 
War II. His mother worked as an assistant in the Atlanta Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Samples calls it a misconception that everyone in public housing is on welfare. 
"A lot of people work," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He sometimes is pessimistic about the poverty that has long surrounded him. 
Perhaps, he thinks, it is time to give up on almost all but the youngest of the 
poor blacks. "This is an inhumane thought, I guess, or insensitivity," he said 
as he showed the Perry Homes to visitors. "But you have to weigh what you have 
and weigh the decisions that have to be made in order to save the future of 
all." 
</P>
<P>
The logic of that course troubles him. "I think to myself, what if someone 
would have said that about me," he explains. "I live in Perry Homes. What if 
someone had said, all right, let's discard public housing because they're not 
going to do anything with their lives and stuff, and we're going to leave them 
sitting over there on the side? So I tell myself, having been in that same 
boat, I could have been discarded." 
</P>
<P>
The wisps of pessimism soon waft away, and Samples feels very good about the 
people around him. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing about the blacks of America, poor blacks anyway, is that we've 
always been able to do a whole lot with just a little bit," he says. "That's 
where I feel we're some of the most innovative and creative people that exist. 
We've come though some adverse conditions that, people say, 'I don't see how 
people could have lived through this, that, and the other.' 
</P>
<P>
"They lived through it by creating and adapting to what was put before them. 
Yet and still, they were not comfortable, but they lived, and life is worth 
living and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
For people who work with the young poor, comparisons to their own youngsters 
make the deprivation clear. "When I dropped out of college at one point in the 
1960s, I didn't have a dime," says Elliott Currie, an influential UC Berkeley 
criminologist studying juvenile offenders. "But I went to work in the steel 
mills, and I was making really good money. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not have been such a great life had I continued doing it," he says, 
"but at the same time, I was making good bucks and I got myself an apartment 
and had all these things and, had I chosen to, I could have lived all right. 
</P>
<P>
"You try and do the same thing now. You'll get the job at Burger King instead 
of the job at the steel mills. It makes a lot of difference. You can't get 
married and support anybody if you only work at Burger King. Believe me, the 
kids know it." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Jones, a 59-year-old Mississippi-born California resident, is bringing up 
her 9-year-old grandson and a 7-year-old granddaughter because their mother, a 
crack addict, neglected them. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter was raised very proper," says the gentle Jones at a mental health 
clinic in Oakland, "and I was surprised when she went on drugs. She had a good 
home, and she was brought up in church. I lived a good life around here. That 
is what a parent should do for their kids." 
</P>
<P>
The grandchildren's father was shot to death in the street by an unknown gunman 
in the aftermath of the 1985 Super Bowl game, she said, and after that, her 
daughter began using cocaine. "She had a crack house where the people went in 
and smoked crack," Jones says, "and I think this affected the minds of the 
children." 
</P>
<P>
After legal battles with her daughter, Jones has custody of her grandchildren. 
"They were abused," she says. "Not abused by beating, but they were neglected. 
She wasn't feeding them, she wasn't clothing them, they had no shoes on their 
feet, she wasn't bathing them. Just mistreating them."

THE DAY AFTER -- AN EERIE LANDSCAPE OF DESTRUCTION; 
</P>
<P>
TUNNEL: A FISSURE SMOKES LIKE A VOLCANIC VENT. A BUSWAY IS BLACKENED. THE 
FREEWAY IS DESERTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Morning light brought into focus a stark scene of destruction Saturday along a 
burned-out stretch of Metro Rail tunnel beneath the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The normally bustling highway stood deserted. On a typical weekday, 210,000 
vehicles would pass this point within sight of Union Station, but this weekend 
there was no traffic. Running parallel to the freeway, a blackened stretch of 
the neighboring El Monte busway bore testament to the heat and smoke from the 
fire that raged for the better part of a day. 
</P>
<P>
Within feet of the eerily silent freeway, the earth had caved in. Where once 
there was solid ground, now there was an elongated fissure, still smoking like 
a volcanic vent. From the streets of the industrial district northeast of 
downtown Los Angeles, one could look at the scene of the cave-in and see 
twisted pipes, broken concrete, vast amounts of sand and hard-hatted engineers 
surveying the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than a block away, near Ducommun and Center streets, the south 
portal of the subway tunnel displayed the ravages of a fire that burned with 
such heat that it twisted and distorted steel. A six-foot, fire-charred piece 
of metal hung precariously above the mouth of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of wood timbers that once lined the interior of the subway tube were 
reduced to ashes like kindling in a fireplace. Smoke still poured from an 
opening above the tube. Firefighters stood by in the summer heat, allowing the 
blaze to burn itself out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, powerful pumps worked overtime in a pit where the tunnel ends, 
sucking out pools of chocolate-brown water and mud that are tangible reminders 
of the battle against the flames. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, a parallel tunnel with a full concrete lining was untouched. 
</P>
<P>
As they peered into the opening below, firefighters recalled arriving on the 
scene around 2 a.m. Friday to find the tunnel in flames. The heat was so 
extreme, they said, water from their hoses was boiling on the street above. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, they marveled at the damage and expressed relief that the intense 
heat did not ignite the nearby storage tanks at Unocal's Center Street 
Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
As they spoke, the morning calm was broken by the groaning of a crane laboring 
to remove parked cars, trucks and trailers whose weight put added burden on the 
crippled tunnel below. 
</P>
<P>
For blocks around, streets remained closed. At the scene, streams of yellow 
police tape framed the destruction.

NADINE HENLEY; EXECUTIVE AT HUGHES' SUMMA CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nadine Henley, top executive and confidante of the late billionaire Howard 
Hughes for almost four decades, has died. She was 83. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Henley died Friday in her Las Vegas home after suffering a stroke last 
week and developing pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
As senior vice president and director of Summa Corp., Hughes' umbrella company 
for all his holdings, she was one of the top three people who ran the Hughes 
financial empire during his final reclusive years and immediately after his 
death in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Henley began her career with Hughes in 1940, when she moved to California 
and worked in the engineering department of Hughes Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
She became Hughes' private secretary in 1943, and developed into his trusted 
aide and confidante. 
</P>
<P>
When Hughes moved to Las Vegas in the late 1960s to build his land and gaming 
empire, Miss Henley remained in Los Angeles to oversee his business interests. 
She moved to Las Vegas the year Hughes died. 
</P>
<P>
The only woman to serve on Hughes' board, Miss Henley retired in 1979 and moved 
briefly to Coronado. She returned to Las Vegas in 1981 after suffering a 
debilitating stroke. 
</P>
<P>
During her years of working for Hughes and after his death, Miss Henley 
maintained the strict silence about Hughes that he demanded of his top aides. 
She always declined offers to write a book or discuss his personal life, which 
could have made her a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Born Nov. 8, 1906, in Bloomington, Ind., Miss Henley first worked for a bank 
and then for Lehman Brothers in Chicago. In 1936, she became one of the first 
women to trade stock on the stock exchange floor. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Henley's fifth husband died in March. She had no children and left no 
immediate survivors.

PATENTING THE SUN POLIO, THE SALK VACCINE, AND THE CHILDREN OF THE BABY BOOM BY 
JANE S. SMITH (WILLIAM MORROW: $22.95; 413 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-688-09494-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Allan M. Brandt, Brandt's most recent book is No Magic Bullet: A Social 
History of Venereal Disease in the United States Since 1890 (Oxford). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the better part of the 20th Century, the summer was a time of fear for 
American parents and children. As schools adjourned for the summer, anxiety 
about the return of paralytic polio would begin to rise. And, of course, there 
were powerful reasons for concern. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the century, polio epidemics would sweep through a city or town; in 
1916, about 27,000 people were paralyzed, 6,000 died. Despite remarkable 
improvements in health by mid-century and the introduction of "miracle" 
therapies for many childhood diseases, polio had only grown as a threat. The 
worst epidemic in U.S. history occurred in 1952, when 60,000 new cases were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
This pattern of anxious summers and long falls, counting the cases-some 
crippled, some dead, some remarkably spared in spite of infection -- came to a 
dramatic end in the spring of 1955 when immunologist Tom Francis announced to 
the world that the polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk and his colleagues at 
the University of Pittsburgh safely and effectively prevented polio. It is this 
dramatic story that Jane Smith tells so effectively in "Patenting the Sun." 
</P>
<P>
Smith shows how polio and the campaign to conquer it reflected the basic 
preoccupations and cultural values of a new generation of post-war Americans. 
The vaccine became a symbol of American scientific expertise, social 
voluntarism and the future of our children. Implicit in the victory over polio 
were heightened expectations that science and medicine would necessarily solve 
the most difficult persisting problems of disease and disability. The triumph 
of the Salk vaccine marks a moment of faith in the technological fix, in the 
magic bullets of modern medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccine that Salk discovered in 1952 marked the culmination of the efforts 
of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, better known as the March 
of Dimes. Founded in 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose personal 
battle against polio had focused national attention on the disease, the 
foundation was led by F.D.R.'s former law partner, Basil O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation revolutionized American philanthropy by seeking funds from all 
Americans, not only the wealthy; everyone could do their bit to fight polio. 
From providing medical services to the afflicted -- iron lungs, leg braces and 
rehabilitation -- the foundation soon moved to provide resources to researchers 
to study the scientific aspects of polio. Although much of the research was 
technical and basic in nature, hopes soon were raised that a vaccine would be 
produced to end the threat of polio. O'Connor became the impresario of polio, 
dominating the philanthropic, public-relations and even scientific aspects of 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Jonas Salk -- brilliant, dedicated and unwavering in his commitment to 
"solving" polio -- remains Smith's hero, although her portrait is nuanced. As 
she clearly shows, while the press and the public quickly came to consider Salk 
a demigod, to many in the scientific community he seemed a demagogue, far too 
eager to go public with his work, far too eager to appear on television or 
radio, to elite bioscientists hardly respectable forums to air scientific 
disagreements. The development of the Salk vaccine, highly publicized by the 
public-relations juggernaut of the March of Dimes, fractured the norms of the 
quiet, autonomous workings of science. Salk and his public pronouncements 
violated the norms of his caste. 
</P>
<P>
Salk's colleagues never forgave him his success. In his quest for the vaccine, 
he left the fold of academic research and never has returned. It was Enders, 
Weller and Robbins who won the Nobel Prize for their earlier discovery that the 
polio virus could be grown in culture -- the basic science breakthrough that 
made all subsequent vaccine research possible. Salk never was elected to the 
National Academy of Science. Many considered his development of the vaccine 
"pedestrian." But as Smith emphasizes, Salk was first, and in this instance, 
first meant that lives were saved by his vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
Making scientific investigations and their vicissitudes accessible to a broad 
audience is no easy task, but Smith makes the science of polio research both 
clear and exciting. She effectively captures the genuine intensity that 
characterized the race to "conquer" polio. One breakthrough led to another, as 
it so rarely does: research from basic investigation into growing the virus in 
culture, and then into "typing" the various strains, quickly led to the 
possibility of a human vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation and collegiality soon succumbed to back-biting (and back-stabbing) 
as titanic egos clashed. The laboratory became more often a place of politics, 
ideologies and bitter personal competition. The vociferous controversy between 
Salk's killed virus vaccine and Albert Sabin's attenuated-virus oral vaccine 
remains something of an epic in the annals of 20th-Century biomedicine. 
</P>
<P>
And indeed, three decades later the protagonists still will take up the debates 
concerning the relative safety and efficacy of these competing products. If 
"Patenting the Sun" has a failing, it is that Smith's narrative fails to go 
adequately beyond these powerful personalities to evaluate the more fundamental 
questions implicit in the scientific and medical controversies raised by the 
development of these polio vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
As the history of the Salk vaccine makes clear, the obstacles inherent in 
evaluating a new medical technology -- especially a vaccine -- are daunting. To 
demonstrate conclusively that a vaccine is both safe and effective is an 
enormously complex undertaking; ultimately a vaccine must be tested on humans, 
who risk succumbing to the very disease for which they are to be immunized. 
Almost 2 million American schoolchildren participated as test subjects in the 
Salk field trials, the largest medical experiment in history. These "Polio 
Pioneers" waited anxiously through the spring of 1955 to see if the vaccine was 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the research and field trials, the federal government was nowhere to 
be found. The failure of the government to maintain adequate oversight of 
vaccine production after the trial led to the distribution of small amounts of 
contaminated vaccine in which all the virus had not been inactivated. The 
notorious "Cutter incident," which resulted in 204 cases of polio and 11 deaths 
among vaccinated children, nearly destroyed confidence in the Salk vaccine. The 
episode made clear the need for an active federal presence in evaluating and 
regulating research and production of vaccines and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, even magic bullets need to be efficiently produced and delivered. 
The persistence of paralytic polio in the developing world signals all too 
tragically this conundrum: Why, given the effectiveness of vaccines for polio, 
do children go unimmunized? 
</P>
<P>
And while celebrating the campaign against polio, it is impossible not to think 
of AIDS. Smith's narrative makes clear that a set of complex relationships 
among science, government and philanthropy, as well as our popular 
understandings of the disease, will fundamentally affect the course of the 
epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter-century ago, one of the Polio Pioneers who bravely volunteered (with 
the consent of her parents) was none other than Jane Smith. Now she has told 
the story of the Salk vaccine -- her story -- with spirit and intelligence.

DR. DAVID FELDSHUH'S 'MISS EVERS' BOYS' EXAMINES A DARK HOUR IN MEDICINE: THE 
40-YEAR TUSKEGEE SYPHILIS STUDY.

<TEXT>
<P>
As Dr. David Feldshuh was writing his play about the notorious 40-year-long 
"Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male," he faced a conundrum: 
He wanted the play to be gripping drama. But he also wanted it to tackle 
complex questions about medical ethics. 
</P>
<P>
He got a gauge of his success the night his play, "Miss Evers' Boys," premiered 
at Baltimore's Center Stage last fall. During one scene that re-creates a 
spinal tap, an audience member fainted, and Feldshuh was called to the balcony 
to treat him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an interesting kind of nexus of my life as a playwriting physician," 
Feldshuh says. "I'm there as a playwright, looking at the play to see if it 
works. And I find myself practicing medicine. Does this mean it works? Or that 
it works too well?" 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles audiences can make their own decisions once the play opens at the 
Mark Taper Forum on Thursday. Winner of the 1989 New American Play Award, "Miss 
Evers' Boys" dramatizes the U.S. Public Health Service "study" from 1932 to 
1972 in which 400 Macon County, Ala., blacks who had syphilis were falsely led 
to believe they were receiving treatment -- while doctors merely observed the 
progression of their disease. 
</P>
<P>
By turning that study into a workable drama, Feldshuh follows a theatrical 
tradition that dates back to Shakespeare's histories, not to mention Greek 
tragedy. Again and again, reality has provided raw material for the stage. It 
was only a matter of time until so tragically powerful a news story made it to 
the stage or screen. 
</P>
<P>
The play's setting is Macon County during the Depression -- a place of poverty, 
minimal education, and even more minimal medical care. The promise of hot meals 
and burial stipends lures human guinea pigs into a medical program where 
patients get some "tonic" and pills maybe once a year, suffer through painful 
and often useless tests, and don't get penicillin treatment even after it 
becomes commonplace. (See story, Page 84.) 
</P>
<P>
Against that larger backdrop, Feldshuh weaves his tale of four fictitious 
tenant farmers and their nurse, Eunice Evers. As their similarly afflicted 
friends begin to get better from penicillin they are denied, Miss Evers' boys 
drink May tea and sit in the moonlight to stave off pain and disability. 
</P>
<P>
They trust in the government and, more importantly, in their Nurse Evers. She 
cares about them, drives them to the doctor, and assures them they won't have 
to be buried in feed sacks like other poor blacks. After the first 14 years, 
each gets a "certificate of appreciation" and $14 -- "a dollar a year," Evers 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
According to Feldshuh, the initial impetus for the Tuskegee Study back in 1931 
was not so reprehensible: a doctor's suggestion to monitor black syphilis 
sufferers for six months or a year, using that study as a wedge to get medical 
funds for poor blacks. That goal that was never realized. Instead, the study 
became a self-perpetuating bureaucratic nightmare that went on for 40 years, 
involved scores of government and private doctors, and only stopped when the 
Associated Press broke the story in July, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"This play is not a vendetta," Feldshuh says. "I have for the most part a great 
deal of respect for the motives of many of the people initially involved. 
Rather, it is an attempt to understand how well-meaning people fail to see the 
moral implications of their actions. The question then becomes 'Is there 
something today that well-meaning people are doing wherein there is also a lack 
of moral insight?' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, when former actor Feldshuh was in his residency in emergency medicine, 
he read in a medical journal about "Bad Blood," historian James H. Jones' 
highly regarded book on the Tuskegee Study. After he read it, he couldn't stop 
-- he read medical reports and Congressional testimony and, as the years went 
by, did personal interviews as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I was drawn to this subject because I recognized feelings in myself that 
concerned me," says the 46-year-old playwright. "I asked myself a simple 
question: 'Would I have done what these physicians did had I been there?.' I 
don't know, but I think I was fearful enough that I wanted to find out exactly 
how it was they let themselves do it. I wanted to explore the process through 
which they allowed themselves to participate in something that was clearly in 
retrospect wrong." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a decade, and through 27 drafts -- so far -- he has attempted to 
first learn from, then teach, the lessons of the Tuskegee Study. 
</P>
<P>
But he was writing a play, not a docudrama. So first, Feldshuh took many of his 
moral and ethical questions and lodged them dramatically in the character of 
Nurse Evers. Evers is "suggested by" Eunice Rivers, the real-life Alabama nurse 
who served as staff, chauffeur and on-site overseer for nearly the study's 
entirety, although less actively after her retirement in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Rivers, who died a few years ago, "never testified in front of Congress (as 
Evers does in the play) and to my knowledge, had concerns about the study but 
did not go public with them," Feldshuh says. The fictitious Evers, however, has 
many doubts. The playwright says her character evolved as he asked himself what 
doubts Rivers "might have had but was unable to express?" 
</P>
<P>
Feldshuh has rewritten since Baltimore, focusing more attention on Evers, and 
actress Starletta DuPois, who plays Evers here, considers the role a "tour de 
force for an actress." The New York-based actress, who coincidentally studied 
nursing at Harlem Hospital School of Nursing before going into acting, has been 
reading "Bad Blood" herself. "But I have to read some, then put it down," 
DuPois say. "How could it have gone on so long?" 
</P>
<P>
That is the question Feldshuh asks throughout his play, and nowhere does he ask 
it more dramatically than through Evers' torment. "Here is a woman who exists 
as a black in a white world, female in a male world, nurse in a doctor's world. 
She loves her patients and has at the same time great allegiance to her 
profession. Now what is she going to do when the profession demands that she 
treat her patients from a distance and not up close? A doctor tells her, 
'You've got to step back and look from a distance,' and she says 'I can't.' " 
</P>
<P>
She is, says Feldshuh, a woman who "seems to be making the right decisions at 
each point but the overall journey is clearly down the wrong road. She is 
trapped in a vortex of small decisions, and it ultimately not only pulls her 
down but finally pulls her apart. It separates her from herself." 
</P>
<P>
There were dramatic dilemmas to resolve in presenting syphilis as well. "How do 
you show syphilis without talking about it, and how do you make it dramatically 
involving without simply reciting that this disease does this or that?" 
Feldshuh asks. "You have to have a strong visualization -- an image of what 
this disease can do to one person to appreciate what it could do to a people." 
</P>
<P>
So Feldshuh's four farmers attempt to escape the despair of their lives in part 
through "the gillee " a competitive dance that the playwright created from an 
amalgam of rural entertainments from the period. "I knew that one of the things 
that syphilis can do to you is make it difficult for you to use your legs, and 
this gives you the image of a potentially brilliant dancer caught by a disease 
that in one of its manifestations can cripple you. Then, instead of this play 
being about disease, it is about conflicting passions and aspirations that work 
themselves out within a net of this disease." 
</P>
<P>
Syphilis, says Feldshuh, "was called 'the great pox,' which suggests how 
prevalent it was throughout history (and still is, with U.S. cases at their 
highest rate now in 40 years). It was going on everywhere in the world and in 
Macon County, where there was no health care, prevalence was high. 
</P>
<P>
"It was also called 'the great imitator' because of how diversely it presented 
itself. Syphilis could have no effects, a mild or a devastating effect. It was 
a complex, subtle disease and that made moral thinking about it also complex 
and subtle. You could point to somebody and say 'It's not so bad. We're not 
treating him and he's fine.' " 
</P>
<P>
Few of these poor, uneducated men even knew they had syphilis, and fewer still 
knew what the Tuskegee Study entailed. Unlike today's research subjects, who 
presumably are informed of the risks and benefits of participation before 
choosing to do so, these men gave no "informed consent." 
</P>
<P>
"As one of the doctors says, 'Those men should have been given a choice,' " 
says Feldshuh. "One of the reasons we've evolved this safeguard (of informed 
consent) is (because of) the Holocaust and the Nuremberg trials, which stated 
that people should be given full awareness of the consequences of what things 
might affect them. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you're at the boundary of medical technology or medical 
experimentation or at that tricky line that separates the frontier of treatment 
from experimentation, you're going to be dealing with ethical issues that are 
central to the play," Feldshuh says. "Informed consent is like checks and 
balances in the government. You don't assume that the motivations will always 
be ethical. You set up a process to create controls." 
</P>
<P>
New York-born and Dartmouth-educated, Feldshuh studied acting at the London 
Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, then moved on to Minneapolis' Guthrie 
Theater (where, in the late '60s, in a Guthrie West Coast tour, he played the 
Taper). He continued moving up at the Guthrie until at age 27 he was the 
theater's associate director. 
</P>
<P>
He was treading diligently upwards on that career path, he recalls, when one 
day he came out of rehearsals of the French farce, "An Italian Straw Hat," and 
was transfixed by a television news broadcast of the massacre of the Israeli 
athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. "It made me wonder 'What am I doing 
here,' and I realized there were questions I wasn't really asking myself. I was 
relatively successful at a young age, so I knew the 'dis-ease' wasn't related 
to a lack of achievement in my career. I had to look elsewhere; I had to look 
within myself." 
</P>
<P>
The energetic and driven Feldshuh apparently asks himself few idle questions. A 
year later, he was off to a Zen Center in San Francisco and to Esalen, 
investigating such things as Gestalt therapy and bioenergetics, trying it all. 
But his quest was also eminently practical -- he turned his research into a 
dissertation called "Seven Consciousness Expanding Techniques and Their 
Relevance to Creativity in Actor Training," and in 1975, picked up his 
doctorate in theater arts. 
</P>
<P>
Feldshuh went back to the Guthrie, created its first hospital touring show, and 
in 1976, entered medical school. He thought about and rejected psychiatry, 
wanting something both "more hands on and more concrete," and decided on 
emergency medicine. He supported himself in part by directing plays at night, 
and after finishing medical school, juggled a free-lance directing career and 
emergency medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Before tackling "Miss Evers' Boys," he'd written just one play, a theatrical 
adaptation of several fables called "Fables Here and Then," which toured 
extensively and at one point featured his sister, actress Tovah Feldshuh. He 
spent considerable time researching "Miss Evers' Boys," and had just a "very 
rough draft" in 1984 when he accepted the job of artistic director of the 
Center for Theatre Arts at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Busy 
teaching and running the center during the school year, he'd work on his play 
during summers at his lake-side place outside Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Feldshuh, who has also somehow managed to continue both his emergency room work 
and his directing, is asked if there are parallels between life as a director 
and life in the emergency room. He shakes his head, yes: "In both cases, you 
are called upon to make decisions, frequently rapid decisions. . . . If you're 
not willing to make a decision and take responsibility for decisions, you 
shouldn't be directing and you shouldn't be doing emergency medicine. Neither 
are environments conducive to serene cogitation." 
</P>
<P>
Feldshuh's inability to let go of his play for so many years worked well in 
terms of its development. Not only are there more workshop opportunities for 
new plays these days, but instead of demanding to premiere a new play, more and 
more regional theaters are now willing to host the second or third production. 
"Miss Evers' Boys," for instance, went through three readings at Minneapolis' 
Illusion Theater, plus the 1989 Sundance Institute Playwriting Workshop and 
last fall's world premiere at Center Stage before getting to the Taper. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Evers' Boys" is currently playing the Illusion, where a production opened 
June 29, and another production is set for Atlanta's Alliance Theatre Co. in 
September. Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson says there's also been 
interest here in terms of moving the play on to other stages (around the 
country) -- and possibly, the big screen -- after the Taper, "but it's a 
question of how, when and where." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson had been in touch with Feldshuh on and off since Feldshuh's Guthrie 
days and particularly since Feldshuh moved to Cornell. A Cornell graduate 
himself, Davidson had been chairman of an advisory panel that oversaw creation 
of the new Cornell center, and says he's been aware of "Miss Evers' Boys" for a 
long time. He hoped to do the play at some point, he says, "and when Center 
Stage could do it first, I said fine, and found the next available time." When 
it appeared last spring that Arthur Kopit's play, "Discovery of America" would 
not be ready this season, Davidson dropped "Miss Evers' Boys" into the Taper 
schedule to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson speculates that "Miss Evers' Boys" will wind up in many regional 
theaters "because it's eminently do-able. Its cast size and subject matter make 
it just the kind of play that belongs in theaters that serve communities. The 
New York question is always who and when and where because the auspices, 
commercial and noncommercial, are always complicated there." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there has also been movie interest, Davidson replies that "there was 
some early interest (in Feldshuh's play) around the time of the Baltimore 
production, but not necessarily linked to it. We thought it was better to 
finish the journey of the play as a play. I'm sure that there will be some 
increased interest once the show is seen here (but) one tends to want to hold 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Feldshuh, meanwhile, is making minor edits on the play, and in fact was still 
fiddling with it during previews last week. But now he's mostly "working on the 
rest of my life. I have a two-year-old son, a wonderful wife and a lot to 
occupy me there. I have more than a full-time job with working in medicine and 
with Cornell. But if 'Miss Evers' Boys' should go to any other medium, I'd look 
at it again. Or if I should find another story that possesses me in the same 
way that this story has possessed me, then I might write another play."

DURHAM DANCING; 
</P>
<P>
EVERY YEAR, THIS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY TOWN SHAKES OFF ITS SUMMERTIME SLEEPINESS 
TO BECOME THE 'U.S. DEPARTMENT OF MODERN DANCE'

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When American Dance Festival executive director Charles Reinhart called Twyla 
Tharp to inform her that she had been selected for this year's $25,000 Samuel 
H. Scripps/ American Dance Festival Award for lifetime achievement, she 
replied: "Can't you just send me the check? Do I have to come down?" 
</P>
<P>
The response can be attributed in part to Tharp's cheeky nature, but it also 
spotlights the off-the-beaten-track location of this major festival. 
</P>
<P>
Each summer, hundreds of strikingly attractive young people, the women often in 
leotard tops and hair pinned up in chignons, roll into town. Their arrival was 
once described as "the invasion of the posture people," a reference to their 
carriage, erect to the point of exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
The students come for classes, the audiences for performances by major 
companies. This year's American Masters Plus series included Paul Taylor, Laura 
Dean, Eiko and Koma, Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham, Erick Hawkins, Doug 
Varone and Trisha Brown and concludes next weekend with Pilobolus. 
</P>
<P>
For six weeks, Durham becomes what Dance magazine calls the "U.S. Department of 
Modern Dance." Because of the Duke 
</P>
<P>
Medical Center and related health-care industries, the city of 100,000 now 
calls itself the "City of Medicine," although it is perhaps better known as the 
home of the minor-league baseball team immortalized in the film "Bull Durham." 
</P>
<P>
When the dancers hit town, the area just off East Campus shakes off the summer 
somnolence that once enveloped Durham: The Regulator Bookshop sells more dance 
books, magazines and out-of-town papers; the Ninth St. Bakery sells more 
croissants and, most nights, it's nearly impossible to squeeze into 
Franchesca's gelato parlor. 
</P>
<P>
A new generation -- '60s-era Duke students who decided they liked Durham enough 
to settle in, or to come back to after graduate school -- has begun taking over 
the city's political and economic leadership. Many, like Lex Alexander, owner 
of a health-food supermarket, have become actively involved in promoting and 
supporting the festival. Alexander serves on the board of a local support 
group, hosting cast parties and arranging for dancers to eat at the home of 
local residents, and organizes audiences for special performances. 
</P>
<P>
"These artists increase the fabric of this community so much," said Alexander, 
who each year puts the festival's poster image and schedule on his store's 
grocery bags. "At a time when the university is closing down (for the summer), 
you get this resurgence of energy, this wonderful influx of people, from all 
over this country and the world that are coming to this town to be involved in 
this dance happening." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, when Tharp receives the award -- just before a square dance in a 
70-year-old, once-condemned gymnasium on the Duke University campus -- the 
contrast with the first such award will be obvious. 
</P>
<P>
That year, 1981, the curtain went up on Duke's 1,500-seat Page Auditorium, 
revealing grande dame Martha Graham -- seated alone in her red "Chinese Empress 
chair," lit by a single spot on the otherwise darkened stage -- waiting for 
former First Lady and Graham dancer Betty Ford to present the award. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what both of them wanted," explained festival director Charles Reinhart. 
"And I think that's the point. What does the artist want, and that's what we 
try to do. The generation gap -- it explains it very easily -- it's right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But Reinhart doesn't see the award to the 49-year-old Tharp as indicative of a 
complete changing of the guard in modern dance. "I don't think that the baton 
has been passed to the younger generation totally," he said. "There are people 
older than Twyla who will be getting the award. I think this was the year that 
Twyla seemed to be on the minds of more of our people than other times, and I 
think there's certainly a body of work that justifies it." 
</P>
<P>
The Scripps/ADF winners bracketed by Tharp and Graham include most, if not all, 
of the pioneers of American modern dance: Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, Hanya 
Holm, Alwin Nikolais, Katherine Dunham, Alvin Ailey, Erick Hawkins and -- named 
posthumously -- Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Jose Limon. These names are 
intertwined with the genesis of the American Dance Festival, which traces its 
origins to the summer of 1934 and the founding of the Bennington School of 
Dance in Bennington, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
Building on the work of the trio many consider the first generation of modern 
dance -- Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn -- Graham and her 
contemporaries went to Vermont each summer until 1942 (with one detour to Mills 
College in Oakland), to teach, learn and create dances in a free-spirited 
atmosphere. After a six-year hiatus, many of the same people reconstituted 
themselves as the American Dance Festival on the campus of Connecticut College 
in New London, Conn. During the next 29 years, the festival became more 
institutionalized, according to a published history written by New York Times 
dance critic Jack Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1977, Connecticut College got a new president who wanted to charge the 
festival rent for the first time, and the New London City Council turned down a 
request for $7,500 in community development funds. Attendance at the evening 
performances was flagging as well, according to Anderson, despite train 
connections to New York City and the proximity to Connecticut shore vacation 
homes of metropolitan residents. 
</P>
<P>
Reinhart got the message and went shopping for a new home, narrowing the choice 
to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, the University of Wisconsin at 
Milwaukee, and Duke. At the urging of a handful of local dance lovers, Terry 
Sanford, then Duke's president (and former North Carolina governor and future 
U.S. senator) successfully wooed the festival, in part with the promise of a 
$1-million endowment from the Durham-based Liggett Group. 
</P>
<P>
The festival's contribution to American modern dance is considerable. Reinhart 
</P>
<P>
points to more than 300 festival premieres, including Graham's "Diversion of 
Angels" (1948), Limon's "The Moor's Pavane" (1949), Merce Cunningham's 
"Summerspace" (1958), Taylor's "Aureole" (1962), Tharp's "Sorrow Floats" 
(1984), Bella Lewitzky's "Pietas" (1971), "Five" (1974) and "Greening" (1976). 
Alvin Ailey's "Masekela Langage" (1969), Tharp's "Medley" (1969) and Pilobolus' 
"Untitled" (1975) and "Molly's Not Dead" (1978) -- the last premiering in 
Durham -- were also commissioned by the festival. Another Taylor premiere 
commissioned by the ADF, "Profiles," was broadcast on public television live 
from Durham in 1979 -- the first-ever live PBS broadcast of a new dance work. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Duke's Georgian East Campus, where the festival is headquartered, is 
taken over by early June. 
</P>
<P>
In coming to clean and leafy green Durham, the trade-off was the heat and 
humidity. Most days by mid-morning, even the best-conditioned, 
best-proportioned and most lithe of bodies are shiny with sweat and 
flushed-faced. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind the humidity," said Stephanie Butler, of Dana Point. "I like to 
sweat." The 23-year-old CalArts dance major said she came to Durham because she 
wanted an intensive program for the summer and "the ADF seemed like the best 
thing." Halfway through the program, she found it "much more rigorous than 
anything I've done. . . . It opens up a whole new world of what dance could 
be." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 300 students -- mostly female and most aged 18 to 
thirtysomething -- on campus for the complete $1,000, six-week study sessions, 
there are shorter seminars for critics, dance therapists, teachers and 
international choreographers. Classes in technique, repertory and choreography 
occupy most of the indoor open space on the campus, including dormitory 
parlors. One jazz class takes over part of the cafeteria, covering the floor 
with a mat. Several weeks ago the class was working through routines, 
accompanied by a small tape machine playing "Vogue" -- by 1978 festival alumna 
Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
The gym where the Tharp presentation is scheduled was occupied each afternoon 
for most of the festival by choreographer Donald McKayle's classes. McKayle, 
who now teaches at UC Irvine, attended the first American Dance Festival in New 
London in 1948 as a member of the New Dance Group at the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very awesome summer for me as young artist," he said, recalling his 
first meeting with Martha Graham. While his students find the current festival 
"very nurturing," McKayle said, sometimes it "becomes an overload, almost," and 
there is a tendency to "overextend themselves physically." 
</P>
<P>
For many of the students and visiting choreographers and dancers from abroad, 
the festival is their most intensive exposure to dance. In addition to classes 
during the day, they are given tickets to two evening performances a week. 
Promising students spotted by faculty members in class are often steered to 
auditions held by companies performing at the festival. Whether the gathering 
is international choreographers, dancers, critics or teachers, discussions 
invariably touch on emotions, politics and aesthetics, as well as 
</P>
<P>
movement and technique, often in eclectic and unpredictable ways. David Hochoy, 
a faculty member, explained to one small group his transition from being a 
Graham dancer to a rehearsal director, and the role of the festival: "It's very 
hard to go to all of a sudden go from being out there to being behind the 
scenes. . . . This is a very intensive teaching process. . . . It made me 
change my consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Glenna Batson, a faculty member specializing in dance and movement therapy, 
observed in the same session that "sometimes I think the worst thing that 
happened to dance was aerobics. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
". . . and MTV," Hochoy chimed in. 
</P>
<P>
"In all the concern with fitness," Batson asked, "what happened to art?" 
</P>
<P>
As with most artistic undertakings this season, the battle over the National 
Endowment for the Arts has hung heavily over the American Dance Festival. The 
governmental funding issue is not an academic one for the festival, which, 
since coming to Durham, has received more than $1.5 million -- including 
$88,000 this year -- from the NEA, according to associate director (and 
Charles' wife) Stephanie Reinhart. (With an annual budget of nearly $2 million, 
the festival has been running a deficit of between $100,000-$200,000 in recent 
years.) 
</P>
<P>
The festival was concerned with artistic freedom well before the current NEA 
crisis. In both form and content, its dances have touched some of society's hot 
buttons. Rarely has a season gone by without fully or partially nude dancers of 
both sexes. The themes of many others have portrayed rape, adultery, violence 
and other challenges to traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Reinhart has been extremely outspoken and active on the NEA front, 
challenging and ridiculing the anti-obscenity guidelines successfully proposed 
by North Carolina's senior U.S. senator, Jesse Helms. 
</P>
<P>
Reinhart says he agrees with Los Angeles' Bella Lewitzky, who has compared the 
assault on the arts to the McCarthy era, and who recently announced she would 
refuse NEA funding rather than sign the current endowment guidelines. Reinhart 
said he doesn't know what he will do if the guidelines are continued -- he 
signed Helms-worded guidelines this year -- but he was clearly in a fighting 
mood, outraged by the recent denial of grants to four performance artists. 
</P>
<P>
When the ADF season began in early June, Reinhart began giving speeches at 
performances and made sure the lobbies were stocked with printed materials on 
the issue. He also helped organize a rally on the Duke campus -- featuring the 
Cleo Parker Robinson Company -- scheduled the day after President Bush visited 
the state to raise a million dollars for Helms' reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The state's other senator, Democrat Terry Sanford, who was so instrumental in 
bringing the festival to Durham and who is on its board, has been oddly quiet 
on the issue of the NEA -- something Reinhart finds troubling in light of the 
campaign of former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt, Helms' underdog Democratic 
challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Reinhart said he wouldn't be surprised to see Gantt run a close race with 
Helms. "With Gantt running this time, and clearly stating his views, instead of 
trying to move closer to Helms -- on pro-choice, on the arts, etc. -- that 
maybe, just maybe. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
If there is an artistic rap these days on the festival, it is that Reinhart has 
his favorites, whom he invites back regularly, and that the festival no longer 
is at the cutting edge of modern dance or its cousin, performance art. But in 
his history, Anderson maintains that once the festival settled in at 
Connecticut College, it was never that innovative. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the most popular of the festival's near-regulars has been the 
acrobatic Pilobolus, and their various offspring: Crowsnest, Momix, Martha 
Clarke and, this season, Peter Pucci Plus. Some of the other artists 
particularly associated with the Durham years include Paul Taylor, Laura Dean 
and Eiko and Koma -- the latter appearing more than half a dozen times, 
occasionally nude. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as artists are concerned," Reinhart said, "we have to go with the 
artists we believe in. . . . It is my firm belief, whether it's Merce 
Cunningham or Eiko and Koma or Laura Dean or Erick Hawkins, that audiences will 
build for them. We've proved that in 13 years. In the early years, they were 
walking out for all those names." 
</P>
<P>
Now, most of their performances this year have sold out or come close to it, 
Reinhart said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of our audiences. They respond to real talent," he said. "Their 
openness to new things is much greater now than in the early years. . . . Our 
box office does well for Eiko and Koma, (which) is not something you serve as a 
first course, but it's a course that you may never forget. . . . If you believe 
in something, and you repeat it, the audiences will come." 
</P>
<P>
There has been some grumbling that this year's schedule leans too heavily on 
familiar artists performing familiar dances. Taylor, for example, offered 
"Arden Court," "Runes" and "Esplanade" -- all quite familiar to Durham 
audiences by now. In response, Reinhart says that newcomers to dance and to the 
area should also have an opportunity to enjoy the classics. 
</P>
<P>
There are other criticisms. One is that no strong local companies -- apart from 
the North Carolina Dance Theater, affiliated with the North Carolina School of 
the Arts -- have taken root in the area, and an early program for area 
choreographers has lapsed. Another is that, for the remaining 46 weeks of the 
year, when the festival is not in town, dance does not draw nearly as strong 
audiences or attention in the media. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that no new American dance star or company has emerged from the 
festival in recent years, Reinhart points to its move into the international 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Modern dance, which Reinhart pairs with jazz as "a basically indigenous 
American art form," is now "exploding all over the world," he said. After the 
festival closes next Sunday, he and 40 other staff members and dancers, 
including the Doug Varone Dance Company and the Dayton Contemporary Dance 
Company, are off for a two-week "mini-American Dance Festival" in South Korea. 
Two similar sessions were held in Japan in 1984 and 1986, the latter featuring 
a Laura Dean premiere. Next year, the ADF plans a similar performance tour to 
India. This year, after Korea, the group will attend the first graduation of a 
dance program they helped establish in Canton, China. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous dancers, choreographers and companies from abroad have been invited to 
Durham to study and perform since 1978. Interestingly, the dances presented by 
the festival from the developed world outside the United States -- Europe and 
Japan in particular -- often speak in the international language of modern 
dance, and are less strongly reflective of their national cultures. Thus, 
following an earlier visit to Japan, Reinhart gave American audiences their 
first good look at Japanese Butoh ("dark soul") in 1982. By contrast, dancers 
from the Third World -- Indonesia, Africa, India and the Philippines -- more 
frequently have integrated traditional native forms and melded them with modern 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Leonid Lebedev, the ballet master of the Mussorgsky Theater in 
Leningrad, is one of those who hopes to set up a modern dance wing at his 
conservatory -- returning modern dance to Russia 70 years after Isadora Duncan 
performed for the Red Army. At one session of dancers from around the world, 
involving simultaneous translations in at least six languages, the Russian 
choreographer 
</P>
<P>
described the informal atmosphere and the dynamic interaction between artists 
as "the glorious system of teaching dance here. I'm amazed by the organization 
here. I feel like a person. People treat me like a person." 
</P>
<P>
The American Dance Festival has evolved since 1978, both organizationally and 
artistically. As it became more comfortable on the campus, the festival moved 
its year-round headquarters south from New York in 1983. When major companies 
do three-night runs, they now perform the same program each night, which 
Reinhart says is to accommodate local critics and to take advantage of good 
word of mouth, as well as to cut production costs. It also has the effect of 
limiting the repertory. This year, the North Carolina Symphony is accompanying 
most of the performances at Page Auditorium, replacing taped music, a practice 
Reinhart hopes to continue. Durham has also changed considerably, becoming 
increasingly multicultural, thanks to the concentration of colleges and 
universities in nearby Raleigh and Chapel Hill, and the Research Triangle Park. 
When the festival arrived, tobacco and textiles were still economic factors, 
but in the years since, a new economy has been built almost literally on the 
ashes of the old. Today, the red brick shells that once housed cotton mills and 
cigarette factories have been leveled or gentrified into shopping centers, 
apartments, condominiums and offices. The courtyard of one such upscale 
shopping mall, Brightleaf Square, is the setting for annual street opera, 
beginning in 1985 with "Carmen," an appropriate choice for a former tobacco 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps with the Connecticut College experience in mind, Reinhart would like to 
have a permanent home for the American Dance Festival. The Liggett Group moved 
its headquarters from Durham to New Jersey several years after the festival 
came, and the promised $1-million endowment never materialized, although 
Liggett has been a generous festival supporter. 
</P>
<P>
Reinhart has long hoped that downtown redevelopment, proceeding in fits and 
starts and focused on the few remaining tobacco factories and warehouses, may 
one day provide the festival with permanent, expanded facilities. Performance 
facilities on East Campus are taxed to the limit and some are even more 
uncomfortable than necessary, inasmuch as the dancers won't work in an 
air-conditioned environment. Administratively, there is a lot to be desired as 
well: To get to Reinhart's East Campus office, you have to pass through a 
bathroom.

WHY I CANNOT BEGIN, DEAR FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by ROBERT McNAMARA 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I heard nothing all those years, saw you for myself, 
</P>
<P>
her friend and mine, joining us in food and close talk, 
</P>
<P>
or those brilliant summer afternoons. Perhaps 
</P>
<P>
I knew you were making love to her the way one knows that 
</P>
<P>
the man on the bench is waiting for no one, though 
</P>
<P>
he looks at his watch, taps his foot, folds and unfolds 
</P>
<P>
his paper. I've wanted to kill you, and some days the sound 
</P>
<P>
of people I love talking in the next room, talking in the 
</P>
<P>
cautious 
</P>
<P>
tones of the half-empty elevator, leaning so that the breath 
</P>
<P>
and flicker of the lips arouse the listener's ear, 
</P>
<P>
is enough. You say that you loved us both, 
</P>
<P>
I would not trap her or another, yet who does not know 
</P>
<P>
how resolutely we dress for hard weather, and the soft place 
</P>
<P>
we shelter underneath? Did you think you could swallow 
</P>
<P>
these contradictions? Love may be a crane or a sparrow, 
</P>
<P>
this hard place, that blackness expanding, drawing us all in 
</P>
<P>
and down. I wonder how you spoke to yourself 
</P>
<P>
as we walked the beach, or alone in your room, looking out 
</P>
<P>
toward 
</P>
<P>
the wavebreak, or in. What true beginning did you compose 
</P>
<P>
for this doubling middle? I loved you, was touched 
</P>
<P>
by your griefs then, such as you opened, 
</P>
<P>
joyed as I could in what happiness you allowed yourself 
</P>
<P>
to feel or say. Asking what was there: this wound is deepest, 
</P>
<P>
was least expected, will be last to heal. Do not imagine 
</P>
<P>
this will change, or wait on this sky, these clouds hanging 
</P>
<P>
an unflattering backdrop for the trees. I can't forgive you 
</P>
<P>
this distance, wanting, this wound, 
</P>
<P>
no more.

AN EARTH WHOSE CENTER ISN'T EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
LACMA'S 'A PRIMAL SPIRIT' TRIES TO SHOW HOW RECENT JAPANESE SCULPTURE CANNOT BE 
UNDERSTOOD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WESTERN ART

<P>
Remember elementary school, where a world map hung on every classroom wall? 
More than likely, that graphic representation of the Earth's topography was a 
Mercator projection, named after the 16th-Century Flemish geographer, 
mathematician and cartographer Gerardus Mercator. In 1568 Mercator drew a 
picture of the continents and their relative positions that, with certain 
alterations, would be in wide use for the next 400 years. 
</P>
<P>
The great cartographer's conception was positively brilliant. It was also quite 
wrong. In order to transfer the spherical drawing on a globe to the flat 
surface of a map, Mercator devised a clever mathematical scheme. The map that 
resulted beautifully preserved the shapes of continents and oceans, but at the 
cost of an incorrect impression of their relative size and position. The map we 
all have come to picture instantaneously in our minds is way out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
There's no reason to assume Mercator was being malicious when he drew this 
skewed picture. He wasn't gleefully attempting a global prank. From his 
perspective, such a projection made perfect sense. It looked right. 
</P>
<P>
His perspective, quite simply, was that of a European man living at the dawn of 
a boisterous era of great colonial conquest. Africa, India, the Orient, the New 
World (both north and south) -- from his home in Duisburg, Germany, Mercator 
looked out on the expanding world and, on a piece of paper, projected what he 
saw. Is it any wonder that the map he drew to record this perception would 
locate Europe smack in the center of the picture -- and make it a good deal 
larger than life, to boot -- while non-Continental locales would be spread out 
toward the periphery? The Mercator projection is something like a global target 
with a European bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of the Mercator projection the other day, while in the galleries of 
the County Museum of Art. The large exhibition, "A Primal Spirit: Ten 
Contemporary Japanese Sculptors," wrestles with Eurocentrism. Curator Howard N. 
Fox has gone to great lengths to show how recent Japanese sculpture cannot be 
understood if approached from perspectives common to Western art. The show 
wants to disrupt our Mercator view of the contemporary-art map. 
</P>
<P>
Or, to use the currently fashionable terminology of Deconstructivism, "A Primal 
Spirit" means to decenter our perceptions. The show acknowledges that these 10 
artists represent neither an organized movement nor the only type of work now 
being done by artists in Japan. But it does attempt to demonstrate the 
existence of an important and convincing art, which, when seen through a lens 
shaped by Western culture, does not disclose its content. The "primal spirit" 
of the title might be described as a quintessential "Japaneseness" in modern 
Japanese art, a way of ordering perception that simply has no counterpoint in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
However, for me, the most compelling piece in the show also happens to throw 
this premise into considerable doubt. The sculpture is Toshikatsu Endo's "Lotus 
II," a waist-high ring of charred wood, clay, steel and water that is both 
visually seductive and conceptually disarming. Perhaps 12 feet in diameter, its 
conventional gathering of elemental qualities of earth, air, water and fire 
invokes ceremonial rituals. 
</P>
<P>
The weathered enclosure seems designed to mark out a significant place. Yet, 
after marshaling its forces to viscerally entice, the sculpture becomes 
unexpectedly disturbing by refusing full access to that inner sanctum. Endo has 
carefully calibrated the scale of the piece to make its mostly visible interior 
finally inaccessible to the spectator. 
</P>
<P>
Leaning over the wide, waist-high wall, you can see only so far into the 
ceremonial volume, never fully penetrating its ever-present, always 
unattainable heart. The interior space is made seamless and constant by the 
circular form of the ring, but in the vicinity of where you stand, that space 
inevitably disappears behind the separating wall. No matter where you move to 
try to grasp the whole, you are defeated. Your mind fully "knows" the hidden 
place, but it keeps slipping out of reach nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledge is a lot like that. Endo's sculpture incorporates an inescapable, 
structural tenet of Zen Buddhist philosophy: Here, the fragment is contained in 
the whole, and the whole is contained in the fragment. This concept does find 
echoes among Western ideas -- for example, in the perceptual gestalts so 
important to American Minimalist sculpture of the 1960s. Still, it is entirely 
possible that this and other sculptures surveyed by this ambitious exhibition 
evince a sensibility that is indeed uniquely Japanese. Who's to say? 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, Endo's sculpture throws the exhibition's premise into 
question for a reason much more easily identifiable than trying to isolate the 
purity of thoughts. Across the patio from the Anderson Building at LACMA, where 
"A Primal Spirit" is on view, is the soaring Shin'enkan Pavilion, which houses 
the museum's historical collection of traditional Japanese art. There, you'll 
notice something significant: The collection contains no sculpture -- at least, 
no sculpture in the modern sense that we, in the West, have come to understand. 
</P>
<P>
Like Western sculpture before the 20th Century, Japanese sculpture 
traditionally partook of functions fully integrated within the conventional 
life of society. Such things as three-dimensional devotional figures and carved 
reliefs designed to be ornamental, especially as architectural decoration, are 
abundant in the pavilion. From the perspective of traditional Japanese culture, 
the idea that sculpture could be regarded as an autonomous entity in itself is 
unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
That idea is peculiar to the modern West, where it fueled generations of 
avant-garde artists. We have come to regard the idiom of gallery- and 
museum-bound art as perfectly normal, but it is in fact an oddity unrepeated by 
any other culture, including Western culture before the modern era. This 
contradiction was most eloquently articulated by Carl Andre, in his great 
sculpture of the 1960s and early 1970s. When he stacked bricks inside the art 
precinct of a gallery or museum, his orderly volumes had to be regarded as 
sculptural ideas. Outside, on the street, they were just ordinary stacks of 
bricks. 
</P>
<P>
Like any American or European artist of the day, the Japanese artists in "A 
Primal Spirit" apparently take this distinction for granted. It's fine with me 
if they do. But the fact that they do also means that this Japanese sculpture 
cannot represent a way of ordering perception that has no counterpoint in the 
West. The idiom itself 
</P>
<P>
is of Western origin, and its embrace by these artists an emphatic sign of its 
global reach. 
</P>
<P>
Laudably, "A Primal Spirit" strives to shake us free from our egocentric and 
ethnocentric illusions, and endeavors to dislodge Western culture from its 
habitual Mercator projection of the world. Finally, however, the show doesn't 
decenter our illusions at all; it simply tries to recenter them, in Japan. One 
privileged ethnocentrism is set aside in deference to another. 
</P>
<P>
The artists, meanwhile, seem to be up to other things. Check out Tadashi 
Kawarmata's huge, shell-like wooden structure, which follows the exterior form 
of the Anderson Building without ever touching it. Tellingly, the art museum 
gives his sculpture form, even though it keeps hands off. Elsewhere, the three 
pyramidal piles of kindling and ceramic blocks in Takamasa Kuniyasu's "Return 
to Self" are like giant funerary pyres, which consume the available space 
inside the gallery. Kuniyasu's and Kawarmata's sculptures are conscious of 
their dilemma. They make me think it's reasonable to wonder whether non-Western 
nations can really modernize themselves, without becoming westernized in the 
process.

IS ROCK RUNNING ON EMPTY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in its near 40-year history, rock 'n' roll is no longer the 
creative center of pop music. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing isn't so much how another pop form -- the controversial, 
inner-city street sound of rap -- has for the moment grabbed the creative 
momentum, but how rock squandered its power. 
</P>
<P>
There is still some experimentation and imagination in rock but the rate of 
progress is almost glacierlike compared to past eras. 
</P>
<P>
And many of the most challenging new artists in rock have been forced into such 
an isolated fringe of the pop world that you need a road map to find them. 
</P>
<P>
The blame for the current stagnation begins with conservative radio programmers 
who favor passive pop sounds over the independent rock spirit that radio 
stations once championed. 
</P>
<P>
However, blame must also be placed on the mainstream rock audience that is 
willing to accept the hollow, artificial sound of countless hit bands -- from 
Bon Jovi to White-snake -- who feed off the tradition of rock without adding an 
ounce of passion to it. 
</P>
<P>
These elements have been draining rock of its vitality since the early '70s. 
The fact that they haven't brought the music to its knees earlier is a tribute 
to the richness of the rock tradition and the leadership of its best artists. 
</P>
<P>
As rock moves into the '90s, however, it's time to look at the durability of 
that tradition and the role of those artists. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many questions: 
</P>
<P>
Is the musical language of rock simply exhausted? 
</P>
<P>
Are many of the music's once-vital figures -- including Bob Dylan, Bruce 
Springsteen and the Rolling Stones -- slowly leading their followers down a 
path of nostalgia? 
</P>
<P>
The answers are not encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* Many of the most creative rock artists from the '60s and '70s -- the Rolling 
Stones to Bruce Springsteen -- do continue to fill stadiums and arenas, but 
their concerts are built largely around material they wrote at least 10 to 15 
years ago. The result is creeping nostalgia that isn't healthy for the artists 
or their audience. 
</P>
<P>
One tenet of young rockers in the early days of the music was to keep growing 
musically so that they didn't end up in Las Vegas showrooms, playing oldies for 
the supper-club crowd. But many of our most respected artists are now doing 
what they once feared. The only difference is they are playing the oldies in 
the Coliseums and the Forums instead of Las Vegas. (See accompanying article.) 
</P>
<P>
* Dozens of the most popular new hard-rock bands -- from Cinderella to Poison 
-- are rehashing the same images and sounds of past rock models. This leads to 
a deadening of the rock 'n' roll pulse. These bands may appear to be upholding 
the tradition of Elvis, the Beatles and Hendrix, but it's consumer fraud. Aside 
from the occasional, inspired Guns N' Roses, arena hard-rock has become the 
professional wrestling of pop. 
</P>
<P>
Where rock's most prized attractions over the years have encouraged independent 
thinking by demonstrating their own individuality, the lesson served up by 
today's passionless mainstream rock heroes is to simply accept the status quo. 
The sad part is that audiences have accepted the music on these terms. 
</P>
<P>
* Thirty-six years after Bill Haley first invited American teen-agers to rock 
around the clock, the musical language of rock seems worn. Because most of 
today's rock groups are dealing with instrumentation and chord structures that 
were introduced -- and largely defined -- in the '50s and '60s, their role is 
reduced largely to mixing and matching past styles. 
</P>
<P>
Traces of the Stones, Beatles, Velvet Underground, Led Zeppelin and the Byrds 
abound. The best of the new bands deal with issues of substance in artful and 
original ways, but it's music, not themes, that gives rock its primary impact 
and the music of rock rarely dazzles the way rivals do in, say, rap. 
</P>
<P>
* Radio continues to champion bland recording acts, while keeping potentially 
revolutionary new ones largely hidden from the mainstream pop audience. This 
trend began shortly after the Woodstock festival in 1969, when radio executives 
realized there were big bucks to be made from this new rock audience. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of promoting the independent, experimental artists whose works infused 
rock with enough power to make Woodstock possible, stations began playing music 
that would appeal to the widest possible audience. This resulted in a timid, 
non-threatening approach that eventually ushered in a whole new set of heroes, 
few of whom mattered. Remember Kansas and Styx? 
</P>
<P>
* MTV, which helped restore a spirit in rock in the early part of this decade 
by giving a young generation of fans its own, new heroes, has also elevated 
visuals to such importance in promotional campaigns that a discouraging number 
of new pop stars seem more gifted as dancers than as singer-creators. 
</P>
<P>
If all this suggests that rock has run out of steam, it doesn't mean that the 
trend is irreversible. At the same time, it is sobering to recall that other 
once-powerful pop styles have virtually disappeared. Rock is not guaranteed a 
place in the pop community of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
Did anyone who loved swing in the '30s imagine that by the '50s the music would 
seem like an antique? 
</P>
<P>
Rock was built on a synthesis of pop styles -- notably gospel, blues and 
country -- and the music may now be able to rejuvenate itself by borrowing 
energy from emerging pop forms. 
</P>
<P>
The need for fresh musical resources has been apparent for years to key veteran 
rock figures -- including Peter Gabriel and David Byrne -- who reached out to 
other pop cultures, including African and Latin American. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's dominance in rock over the last 25 years is due in part to the 
willingness of English music fans to assimilate musical strains from other 
cultures and countries. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the British rock community embraced reggae and rap faster than U.S. 
rock listeners, British fans now are turning to various forms of hip-hop and 
the ultra-fast disco sound of Chicago-based house music more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
One significant part of the much-publicized Manchester music scene in England 
is the way rock fans there accept equally music from the guitar-oriented or 
techno-pop bands from the area as well as disco music from Italy or Chicago, 
rap from Los Angeles and New York and more conventional rock. There's no list 
of acceptable and unacceptable styles. 
</P>
<P>
That's not typically the case in this country. One reason U.S. rock fans are so 
narrow in their tastes is an "us" versus "them" attitude that was the outgrowth 
of radio station strategy in the mid-'70s. The stations felt that the easiest 
way to build a strong rock identity in the heavily competitive ratings battle 
was to exclude country, pop and soul music strains. 
</P>
<P>
Rap's vitality in recent years is due in part to the intensity of the black 
teen-age fans who insist on new attitudes and sounds from their favorites and 
who don't 
</P>
<P>
depend on radio -- which, outside of KDAY-AM in Los Angeles, rarely plays rap 
-- to discover new artists. 
</P>
<P>
The rock world appears powerful and unified when millions around the world tune 
in Live Aid or when thousands turn out night after night to see the consensus 
superstar of a given year -- Prince during the "Purple Rain" tour . . . Bruce 
Springsteen on the "Born in the U.S.A." tour . . . U2 during the "The Joshua 
Tree" tour. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the audience seems simply curious -- merely checking out what's 
hot, akin to seeing the latest blockbuster at the local movie theater. The same 
fans might go with equal enthusiasm a few nights later to see the bland 
pop-rock offerings of Phil Collins or Richard Marx or Skid Row or Warrant. 
</P>
<P>
While it's possible for individual fans to find bands -- from Jane's Addiction 
and Soundgarden to the Jesus and Mary Chain and Megadeth -- that mean as much 
to them as the Beatles or the Who did in a different age, these bands show 
little sign of touching the mass pop consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the mainstream invisibility of worthy "underground" attractions is due 
to the timidity of radio programmers, but hundreds of young bands have 
contributed to the gulf between the pop mainstream and the alternative rock 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Having grown up in a pop climate that taught them virtually everything on the 
radio is worthless, they don't even try to reach for hits the way the Doors, 
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, the Beatles and the Stones and Creedence Clearwater 
Revival once did. They are satisfied by the independent, largely underground 
network that was pioneered by such radical, uncompromising groups as Black Flag 
and the Replacements. 
</P>
<P>
This has led to an impasse. Much of the pop world has lost faith that rock is 
still vital and much of the rock world no longer strives to reach a mass 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
So what lies ahead? 
</P>
<P>
If the mass pop audience refuses to demand more, it's unrealistic to expect 
radio to change. Stations are presumably playing the music that people want to 
hear. 
</P>
<P>
But the matter of respected rock veterans stripping themselves of the nostalgia 
components is a valid area of discussion. David Bowie's revolutionary vow to 
stop doing all his old songs after his current "Sound + Vision" tour made sense 
-- and several other veteran artists should consider following his lead. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: Elvis Costello, Elton John, Paul McCartney, Willie Nelson, Tom 
Petty, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart and Stevie 
Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone will be pleased if any or all of those 10 artists kisses the past 
goodby. 
</P>
<P>
Accountants, record company executives and concert booking agents for a start 
will be disappointed -- because there is money to be made in those oldies. 
</P>
<P>
Fans don't just love their MTV. They also love their old favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Established acts who swear off the nostalgic hits may lose a good share of 
their concert audience. 
</P>
<P>
Giving up the old material may be too much of a sacrifice for these almost 
legendary veterans in terms of ego and flamboyant lifestyles, yet there is much 
to gain in such a move, most notably the thrill of re-establishing one's 
artistry. 
</P>
<P>
Don Henley and Sting, in leaving the Eagles and Police, respectively, have 
already shown that it is possible to move forward successfully with a new body 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie's "Sound + Vision" tour stands as a valuable lesson on why nostalgia 
shortchanges both artist and fan. 
</P>
<P>
Time and context are as important as chord changes and melodies in rock and 
Bowie's old songs no longer speak to the times the way they did in the '70s, 
when the young Englishman challenged sexual and social conventions with a 
boldness achieved only by a handful of artists in the modern pop era. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie's own distance from the music at Dodger Stadium made it difficult for the 
older members of the audience to feel comfortable celebrating the past, and the 
idea of a history lesson for the younger fans was a cheat because they were 
getting the music without any understanding of the context that once made it 
relevant. 
</P>
<P>
Will rock become a valuable but minority part of the pop spectrum -- alongside, 
say, country music and jazz? 
</P>
<P>
Or will rock rally and reclaim its dominance in the pop world? 
</P>
<P>
The future may well depend on how the rock community -- from radio programmers 
to artists to fans -- answer this question: Is the music still worth fighting 
for?

RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: THE DAY SOME HILLBILLIES MOVED TO BEVERLY HILLS

Dirt-poor Jed Clampett gives away his oil-rich swamp this week for a measly 25 
dollars. Fortunately, the OK Oil Co. pays him in that "new kind of dollars" -- 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
Even that amount might not sound like much in these days of $50 million Lotto 
jackpots, but in 1962, when The Beverly Hillbillies first aired, it was more 
than enough to load up the truck and move to Beverly (Hills, that is). 
</P>
<P>
In the premiere episode (Tuesday at 11 a.m. on KDOC), Jed's not so sure he 
wants to leave his Ozarks paradise-a place crawling with critters, eight miles 
from neighbors and without indoor plumbing. But he decides the family can rough 
it when he learns about such wonders as smog (must be a kind of small hog, he 
figures). 
</P>
<P>
In their first days in Californy (airing the rest of the week on KDOC), Granny, 
Jed, Elly May and Jethro will discover their prison-size house, the cee-ment 
pond and those big pink chickens; next-door neighbor Mrs. Drysdale will 
discover that the Clampetts are hazardous to her mental health. 
</P>
<P>
The critics took to "The Beverly Hillbillies" about as well as Mrs. Drysdale 
did, but the viewers loved the show, so it lasted until 1971 (by which time the 
Clampetts' fortune had grown to $95 million).

DIAPER RASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Michelangelo had finished his Last Judgment fresco in the Sistine Chapel, 
certain Vatican art experts were disturbed by all those nudes with their 
privates visible from anywhere in the room. Full frontal nudity was just a 
little too racy for Counter-Reformation sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The authorities got the painter's student and friend, Daniele da Volterra, to 
paint little curls of cloth over the offending parts of the figures, much to 
the relief of the moral arbiters of the Church. Immediately upon completion of 
his thankless project, Daniele was dubbed by local wags "the Diaper Maker," a 
name that has stuck to this day. 
</P>
<P>
Leafing through the May 13 Book Review, one discovers an illustration by 
Danziger that accompanies your review of Shisako Endo's book, "Foreign 
Studies." And, voila: The spirit of the Council of Trent is vigorously with us 
at the Good Gray Times! 
</P>
<P>
Here hunches the poor, wet Japanese scholar before Francois Rude's "La 
Marseillaise." In the original relief, standing among a clutch of hairy Gauls, 
is the personification of the youth of France clad in a bundt-cake mold, a 
length of rope and his socks. 
</P>
<P>
As he is presented by M. Rude, there's not much question about the gender of 
this very physical spirit. The boy in Danziger's drawing, however, wears an 
ABD-pack wrapped around his right quadriceps/femur, which hides the source of 
any possible Mother's Day embarrassment to Times readers. Thanks to Danziger 
and The Times Curia for protecting us from the awful truth.

HIGH HORSE

<TEXT>
<P>
Having just read Aram Saroyan's review of Robert Ferrigno's "Horse Latitudes" 
(April 8), I have a suggestion for The Times: Why don't you choose reviewers 
who either write in, are familiar with, or like the genre they're critiquing? 
It is obvious from the review that Saroyan does not like the "noir" or 
"thriller" novel. . . . 
</P>
<P>
His criticisms revolve around the book's pacing, which is, indeed, fast; and he 
decries the novel's lack of character development. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, "Latitudes' " characters are very well-developed and 
consistent throughout, even if we don't know each character's family tree. 
</P>
<P>
If I had wanted to read an overdeveloped, boring book, I'd have bought another 
of Saroyan's. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Saroyan criticizes Ferrigno (by) calling him a "journalist," as if it 
were an epithet. Luckily, such journalists as Hemingway, London and Twain 
didn't see journalism as a barrier to good literature. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In short, how can anyone complain when an author writes a book that the reader 
can't put down? In the future, please select your reviewers with more care.

STORYTELLERS: NEW IN AUGUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stir up the ingredients of a good, fast-paced story and you'll flush forth the 
usual: romance, passion, suspense and three-dimensional characters. But it's 
more than coincidence that an extra edge is found in the novel that carries 
with it another ingredient: villainy, pure and simple. Black-heartedness 
running rampant is icing on the cake, and the popular fiction hitting the 
marketplace in August has it in abundance. 
</P>
<P>
The publishers bill Rebecca Ryman's work, Olivia and Jai (St. Martin's Press: 
$19.95; 640 pp.), as "a novel of passion and betrayal in 19th-Century India," 
and it is almost an understatement for this sweeping, powerful and complex 
story of entwining business interests, global politics and social back-stabbing 
in this -- at the time -- isolated corner of the British Empire. The year is 
1848, the setting Calcutta, where the strong-willed Olivia, born, reared and 
educated in California by her writer-rancher-environmentalist father, has been 
sent to spend a year with her aunt, Lady Bridget Templewood, while the widowed 
father stakes new claims in far-off Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
It's a rude, cultural shock for both niece and aunt -- Olivia plopped down in 
the very proper, stultifying, atmosphere of colonial India where her uncle, Sir 
Joshua, heads Calcutta's largest tea-exporting business -- and no less so for 
Aunt Bridget, who has aspirations for mating Olivia (as well as her own 
daughter, Estelle) to, you know, the proper type of wealthy English peerage. 
Romance, however, comes in the form of Jai, a half-breed known locally, and 
hated by the British, as Kala Kanta, or the Devil, and the venom is 
particularly thick between the Templewoods and Jai. A shipper, Jai controls the 
only fleet of fast clipper ships plying the India-England route that all 
exporters, particularly the Templewoods, need desperately. 
</P>
<P>
The ground is laid, aplenty, for scandal, treachery and intrigue as the affair 
between Olivia and Jai thickens, and as Jai and the Templewoods clash over coal 
(which Templewood needs to give his own ships a competitive edge with Jai's 
clippers) mined by a Maharaja in northern India. But there are old secrets and 
villainies further intensifying the hatred between Jai and Sir Joshua -- not 
the least of them being the relationship between the young Sir Josh and Jai's 
dead mother. This is an incredibly complex story line where it is only possible 
to scratch the surface of the racial, economic and emotional conflicts that 
ultimately tear the Templewoods apart, and Jai and Olivia apart as well. 
</P>
<P>
While author Ryman is an admitted pseudonym -- because, as an Indian, her 
extended family might be embarrassed by the passions described in "Olivia and 
Jai" -- it is impossible to believe that this masterful and beautifully crafted 
novel of romance and intrigue against such a lavish background could be a first 
effort. This is a skilled and articulate work that is a Literary Guild and 
Doubleday Book Club alternate selection and for which foreign rights already 
have been sold to nine countries. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of a born loser named Salvatore D'Amore, a case which Marcel 
Montecino explores in detail in Big Time (William Morrow: $19.95; 488 pp.). 
Life for New Orleans-born-and-reared Sal should have been kinder -- as a 
teen-ager he had tremendous potential as pianist, vocalist, songwriter and 
arranger. Instead of following his agent's urging to make a break for the big 
time, D'Amore chooses the line of least resistance: trading on his local fame 
with one-night gigs. 
</P>
<P>
In his 30s, he is reduced to occasional bookings but works, primarily, as a 
bartender booking bets for the New Orleans Mafia. And this is a crowd no one in 
his right mind would try to double-cross -- like pocketing the customers' bets 
on the assurance that, of course, they've picked the wrong horse. Except that, 
from suddenly being $70,000 in the black, Sal is even more suddenly $170,000 in 
the hole and, in a crowd where holding back a $2 tip from the Mafia can get 
your kneecaps shattered, a debt like this has extermination written all over 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In "Big Time," author Montecino is following up on his earlier best seller, 
"The Crosskiller," with a chase story that is as beautifully crafted as it is 
blood-chilling. For the New Orleans Venezia family, neither time nor distance 
can save Sal D'Amore from paying the ultimate price for betrayal -- and doubly 
so when one of its prize hit men, tracking Sal to Waukegan, both fails in his 
mission and never returns to New Orleans. (Never mind that a heart attack did 
him in -- the Valenzias have added murder, now, to Sal's dossier). 
</P>
<P>
Fleeing abroad (although he can't really breathe freely there, either), Sal 
falls in with beautiful teen-ager Isabel Gemelli, who is not only the heiress 
to a Gucci-type Brazilian leather fortune but, more important, has a God-given 
pop music talent that -- with the right training -- could catapult her to 
inter- national fame. Even as he flinches at sudden noises and unexpected 
shadows, Sal is drawn in spite of himself to the shaping of this girl, and his 
own dormant talents as writer, composer, arranger and teacher explode as they 
never could have in New Orleans. It's a deadly mix as Sal's involvement with 
Isabel throws him more and more into the international pop-music spotlight -- 
the same spotlight that it is essential he avoid when it draws him back to the 
United States and the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This is a real hair-curler of a story that explores the seamy side of New 
Orleans' underworld as well as the glitz and political maneuvering that goes 
into the making of an international pop-music star. How, or can, Sal ever free 
himself from the relentless, narrow-eyed killers stalking him? We've taken a 
blood-oath never to tell. 
</P>
<P>
The "what if?" story line has tantalized novelists since the beginning of time 
("what if" the South had won the Civil War?), but few have had the temerity to 
apply it to a dramatic episode so recent in time, and so loaded with characters 
whose survivors are still extremely powerful, as has George Bernau. 
</P>
<P>
In Candle in the Wind (Warner Books: $19.95; 499 pp.), Bernau takes a bold 
stance: What if the 1962 death of Marilyn Monroe by drug overdose hadn't 
resulted in her death, and what if that overdose hadn't been either suicidal or 
accidental but a botched homicide attempt? But, hey! We're talking fiction 
here, so it isn't Marilyn Monroe, but Marilyn Lane, and the handsome movie star 
who plays a key role and is related by marriage to the White House is, 
actually, Paul Townsend (wink!). The attorney general of the United States is 
Tommy Kerrigan (wink!); the President of the United States is Jack Kerrigan 
(wink!), and Marilyn's ex-husband is a failed prizefighter instead of a 
you-know-what (wink!) 
</P>
<P>
Discovering the naked body of the love goddess, comatose and hovering near 
death, in her Brentwood home, Townsend sends for a cynical Hollywood private 
eye, Frank Galvan (private detective to the stars) to help spirit Marilyn to a 
hospital for discreet treatment. A nice logical-enough beginning for a "what 
if?" story, right? Except that the star disappears; her private doctor turns up 
murdered; a housekeeper also is dispatched, and the capable Galvan sudfdenly 
finds himself surrounded by villains of all shapes and descriptions as his hunt 
for "the most popular movie star in the world" leads him into the bowels of 
Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
He is far from alone in his search -- there are Mexican desperadoes after her, 
a shadowy hired assassin (in whose employ?) and equally shadowy CIA and White 
House agents. Which of them, like Galvan, are out to save Marilyn? Who are out 
to finish the Brentwood job? 
</P>
<P>
Bernau, whose earlier work, "Promises to Keep," was well-received, does a 
masterful job here in weaving fact, prevalent myths and artful fiction into a 
fast-paced thriller that races from Los Angeles to Baja, back to Los Angeles 
and then to the East Coast -- Washington and then a narrow wooden bridge over 
the chill waters of Triondak Bay near the Maryland coast. There are plots 
tumbling on top of subplots, and there is enough skulduggery -- at the 
international level, the national level, the Hollywood level and at the 
human-passion level -- for a dozen books. 
</P>
<P>
This is an ingenious puzzler with tightly paced transitions of time, place and 
character that make it almost impossible to put down. Not once -- and this is 
the critical measure -- is there a note of incongruity . . . not one temptation 
to say: "Ah, c'mon, it couldn't have happened that way!" Unshakeably: It could 
have. And who among us can say it didn't? 
</P>
<P>
In Lois Battle's new work, The Past Is Another Country (Viking: $19.95; 412 
pp.), we have an absorbing tale of three women who had been together as girls 
at a strict Catholic school, St. Brigid's, in the remote western area of 
Australia -- three women with widely divergent backgrounds who go on to lead 
widely divergent lives, but whose paths cross as adults and who, in retrospect, 
have crossed paths with each other more than any would have dreamed. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for instance, Megan Hanlon, who had lived in Australia with her aunt 
and uncle while her American parents had worked in America, and who is now a 
promising American screen director on the verge of winning her first Oscar for 
a documentary and who is looking for financial backing for her first feature 
film. In the meantime, shy, retiring Greta Papandreou Burke is an Australian 
farm wife married to the internationally known surgeon, Tasman Burke. Finally, 
there is Joan, the Mother Superior of St. Brigid's, formerly Sister Mary 
Magdalene, the youngest and most unorthodox (and, therefore, the best liked) 
teacher that Greta and Megan had had. 
</P>
<P>
Brought back together by a high-society party feting international film makers 
lured to Australia by the Academy Awards, the three are reunited -- and the 
villain, time, has made profound changes in their lives. Joan, under the new 
freedom permitted by the Catholic church, has taken back her own name, gone to 
college and fallen in love with her professor -- has almost strayed from the 
church for him -- but has returned to her first love, and duty, as Mother 
Superior at St. Brigid's. Megan and Greta -- the former with a failed marriage 
behind her and the latter feeling the need to break away from her dominating 
surgeon husband to exercise her own creativity -- are equally restive. The 
reunion will resolve the hunger for independence that both of them feel -- and 
that Joan, in her own way, has solved. 
</P>
<P>
This is a story of three strong-willed women, each grasping for her own niche 
in life and ultimately finding it.

First published in 1937, Eric Ambler's "A Coffin for Dimitrios" served as the 
model for the modern spy thriller reviewers call -- with more enthusiasm than 
grammar -- "a page-turner" or "a good read." Mystery writer Charles Latimer 
painstakingly reconstructs the career of the elusive master criminal, drug 
dealer and paid assassin, Dimitrios Makropoulos; Ambler builds his story with 
equal care, inexorably leading the reader to a startling climax in the 
lower-class quarters of Paris. This taut evocation of Europe between the wars 
reveals how much pop pulp fiction, from the novels of John le Carre to "Murder, 
She Wrote," owes to Eric Ambler.

Bill Barich writes about such traditionally male activities as fishing, horse 
racing and beer drinking, but these light, agreeable articles from The New 
Yorker are pleasantly free of macho posturing. Barich describes the inhabitants 
of a modest pub in a threadbare London neighborhood, the savor of fresh Tuscan 
olive oil and the lonely pleasures of trout fishing in Northern California. A 
diverting book to read while in the throes of planning a vacation, when it 
seems easier and wiser to stay home and sulk.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE VENETIAN EMPIRE A SEA VOYAGE BY JAN MORRIS (PENGUIN:

This affectionate, somewhat romanticized account of the Venetian Stato da Mar 
combines elements of a travelogue with social and political history. When Doge 
Enrico Dandolo arranged the sack of Constantinople by the armies of the Fourth 
Crusade in 1203, Venice acquired an overseas empire, almost as an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
These islands and coastal enclaves were used to protect the trade routes to the 
East, but the Venetians proved to be erratic governors. Crete and Cyprus were 
so badly mismanaged that revolts became endemic, while Corfu was so well 
administered, it remained a bastion of the empire until 1797, when Napoleon 
extinguished the millennium-old Venetian republic. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Morris blends descriptions of the lands and ruins with the story of their 
fall to the advancing Ottoman Turks; her nostalgic evocation of the splendors, 
tyrannies and follies of the Serenissima will delight patrons of the 
Renaissance Pleasure Faire.

LOOKS: CREAMS OF THE CROP; 
</P>
<P>
EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS PROMISE TO FIRM, UNWRINKLE AND SMOOTH DRY SKIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
SOME PEOPLE are so worried about facial wrinkles that they're willing to spend 
$100 on a jar of moisturizer. Taking note, the cosmetics industry has expanded 
its skin-care focus to the rest of the body and offers such products as $50 
jars of green mud that promise younger-looking, radiant skin from the neck 
down. That product's manufacturer says it sells "hundreds of thousands" of jars 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, cosmetics products that promised to moisturize and revitalize the 
body accounted for about $50 million in U.S. sales. Now, according to recent 
industry surveys, that number is increasing by 15% each year. But it's not only 
hopes of alleviating parched skin that motivates people to buy these creams, 
lotions and oils, nor is it merely the ads that promise a younger, sexier look. 
Many consumers look upon these products as a way to help them relax while they 
try to improve their skin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than a dry-skin issue," says Mary Tumolo, training director at 
Princess Marcella Borghese, makers of Fango, the green mud. "It's a given that 
a product will moisturize; that's the norm. Now women want a product that does 
more." Tumolo contends that consumers who plunk down big dollars for body 
creams and lotions are trying to re-create the feeling of a spa in the home. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't afford the time to go to a spa," says Linda Freedman, director of 
marketing for a Los Angeles computer-software firm, "and even if I could, I 
wouldn't spend $2,000 for a few days at the Golden Door." Instead, she gets 
massages twice a month and spends several hundred dollars each year on body 
creams and bath products. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers insist that relaxation and pampering are only partial 
explanations for the body-care boom. "Throughout the '80s, the trend was toward 
sophisticated face treatments," says Carol Schuler, a vice president at 
Clarins, a firm that specializes in treatment products. "Everyone became body 
conscious," she adds. "The awareness that creams could make a difference on the 
face led women to look for solutions to body-skin problems." 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration, which monitors cosmetics claims, constantly 
reminds consumers that no cosmetic product will lift a breast, flatten a 
stomach or smooth a cellulite-plagued bottom. But the popularity of such 
products as Biotherm's Actif Ventre Ferme Stomach-Firming Treatment or Clarins' 
Cellulite Control Gel indicate that consumers think they're getting results. 
Most of these cosmetic creams work in one of two ways. Some, such as bust 
creams, plump the skin cells by adding and trapping water on the surface, 
causing the skin to feel temporarily firmer. Others, especially anti-cellulite 
products, draw water out of the surface cells so the skin looks thinner and 
firmer. Results are sometimes noticeable but are always temporary. 
</P>
<P>
These products are no alternative to cosmetic surgery. On the other hand, many 
products promise to help soothe, relax and moisturize the body in the bath, and 
those often deliver on their promise. The therapeutic benefits of a leisurely 
soak, which relaxes the muscles, have long been acknowledged by the medical 
community. In addition, psychologists such as Dr. Ellen Siroka Robinson, a New 
York-based therapist, recognize the bath's psychological benefits. Robinson, 
who leads corporate stress-reducing programs, advocates the bath as a safe and 
beneficial alternative to tranquilizers or alcohol for overstressed individuals 
who have trouble relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
"A tepid bath helps relax muscles, and the addition of oils and things 
appealing to the senses, such as smell, helps soothe and calm," Robinson adds. 
That line of thinking has led manufacturers to concentrate on many new products 
for the bath. Quite a few, such as Avon's Aroma Spa collection, emphasize the 
benefits of aromatherapy, which uses naturally scented essential oils to affect 
the mood. Scientists who study scent have found that when certain oils such as 
chamomile, basil and rose are added to a bath or massaged into the skin, the 
body apparently relaxes more completely. Couple a mood-altering scent and some 
moisturizers in a warm bath, and there seems to be a case for manufacturers' 
claims that a product "nurtures" or "relaxes the mind and body." 
</P>
<P>
But it's important for consumers to keep in mind that no matter what these 
products are called, all of them are still cosmetics, items that are designed 
not to substitute for medical treatments but to make good grooming easier and 
more pleasurable.

THE MEXICAN Revolution of 1910 drastically altered Mexico's artistic climate, 
freeing native artists from the prevailing French and Spanish standards of the 
time. Later, in the 1930s, with the importation of modern offset presses to 
print large color images, many painters discovered they could earn a living as 
commercial artists in the growing advertising business. 
</P>
<P>
The sophistication of Mexican advertising art (used most often in the 1930s to 
publicize cigarettes and beer) is showcased (through Sept. 16) at The Old 
California Store, an antiques shop in Ventura specializing in California Rancho 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a similarity in styles in '30s Mexican and American art," says Don 
Shorts, co-owner of The Old California Store, though, he says, the Mexican 
pieces are more ethnic and regionalized, stressing pre-Columbian and Aztec 
influences. The collection includes about 30 rare color lithographs, most 
dating back to the '30s, the art form's heyday. Prints measuring 16x24 inches 
run about $175.

THESE DAYS, Adrian Kalvinskas isn't traveling much, but he's learning a lot 
about the world. As owner of Distant Lands -- A Traveler's Bookstore, 
Kalvinskas gets a lot of off-the-wall questions about a lot of off-the-wall 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real education," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The small, comfortable shop invites intense browsing. In addition to maps, 
4,500 travel titles and a wide selection of travel videos, Kalvinskas stocks an 
extensive armchair-travel section. "It's less dry to take an armchair adventure 
than to read a guidebook," he believes. "Travel literature gives a better idea 
of people and place." 
</P>
<P>
Kalvinskas grew up in the Pasadena area and, after following his own 
wanderlust, decided to become involved in the evolution of Old Pasadena. "It's 
a lot of fun," he says of running such a bookstore. "Ninety-nine percent of the 
time people come in happy because they're excited about traveling."

SOMETIMES THE grandest gesture is best served by the smallest of trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
And while the miniature wedding cakes sold at The Bakery on Melrose aren't 
exactly Cartier, they are jewels in their own right. Just 5 inches in diameter 
and 6 inches high, these three-tiered cakes are perfect, tiny versions of the 
traditional wedding cake. 
</P>
<P>
The mini-cakes ($22.50 each) come in white- or chocolate-cake versions with 
apricot or raspberry filling, and The Bakery prides itself on using only pure, 
natural ingredients and flavorings. What could be more perfect for an 
anniversary celebration -- or perhaps to sweeten a marriage proposal?

I can empathize with Gary Coleman in his legal dispute with his parents. A 
mental competency hearing is always a demeaning intrusion into one's private 
life; it is even more agonizing when it is played out in the media. 
</P>
<P>
It is particularly heinous when it is proved that the charge was warrantlessly 
and maliciously brought before the court. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it happens often. It is too easy for a relative who claims he or 
she is simply acting out of concern -- when the truth is the person is acting 
out of greed, jealousy or hatred -- to humiliate an individual by publicly 
questioning his mental competency. Thankfully, most of the judges who preside 
over competency hearings are not easily swayed by the numerous experts and 
"reputable" witnesses the accuser presents to add credence to his or her 
spurious case.

In the 1988 She's Having a Baby (KCOP Sunday at 6 p.m.), John Hughes, who seems 
to be crafting a comic valentine to approaching fatherhood, in a queasy mixed 
message, also shows marriage to be an uncontrollable, off-kilter horror. Kevin 
Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern star. 
</P>
<P>
A Friendship in Vienna (KNBC Sunday at 7 p.m.) is a notable 1988 TV movie, that 
rare pleasure, a family film of maturity and substance centering on the 
friendship of two 13-year-old girls-one Jewish (Jenny Lewis), the other 
Catholic (Kamie Harper)-that endures the fall of Austria in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Arkush's 1979 Rock 'n' Roll High School (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.) is a 
rambunctious drive-in movie designed to show off those New Wave rockers the 
Ramones and drawing upon the old formula of rock-crazy kids in collision with a 
kill-joy principal; trouble is, this picture says it's OK to burn down the 
school if you don't get your way. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the 1985 teen-sex comedy Secret Admirer (KCOP Monday at 8 p.m.) 
takes more cues from Georges Feydeau than Mad magazine, it loses its sparkle 
halfway through. C. Thomas Howell stars. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise (KTTV Wednesday at 8 p.m.) 
plays like a gross parody of the original, a funny and popular 1984 college 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
The Siege of Firebase Gloria (KCOP Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a 1989 release, is a 
rare and noteworthy example of the straightforward Vietnam combat action movie. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lester's Class of 1984 (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.) is a scary piece of pop 
art, envisioning a time when a teacher (Perry King) can be driven to pulling a 
gun to make his students pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
David Lynch's Dune, Part 1 (KTLA Saturday at 6 p.m.; Part II next Sunday at 6 
p.m.) is a vast, languorous 1984 science-fiction epic from the Frank Herbert 
cult classic set on a wasteland planet populated by gigantic worms. Kyle 
MacLachlan stars. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hyams' 2010 (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.), the solidly entertaining rather 
than mystical sequel to R2001," finds Roy Scheider on a joint Soviet-American 
mission to find out what happened to the original "Discovery" flight.

This 1988 comedy is a pleasant enough way to tour the south of France; it's 
blithe and witty, with as many twists as a Riviera roadway. Michael Caine, 
left, stars as a con man extraordinaire challenged by a seemingly klutzy 
American con man (Steve Martin).

Mas Ophuls' 1950 all-star French film of the Arthur Schnitzler play takes us 
back to an elegant and melancholy turn-of the-century Vienna as our narrator 
(Anton Walbrook) tells us of a merry-go-round of romance, which begins and ends 
with the picking up of Simone Signoret's young and slim streetwalker. Much 
bemused acceptance of the human foibles of infidelity and self-deception. Also 
stars Simone and Serge Reggiani (pictured).

THE BEST OF BASEBALL; 
</P>
<P>
A TOTALLY SUBJECTIVE COLLECTION OF THE SPORT'S MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS (ON 
TELEVISION) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEO BANKS, Leo Banks is a Tucson, Ariz., writer. His articles have appeared 
in Sports Illustrated, Sport and The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Compiling a list of the 10 greatest moments in baseball broadcasting on TV is 
preposterous, presumptuous and of questionable journalistic merit. But those 
are only some of the reasons for doing it. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest is it's fun. And nobody can call up later and say, "Hey, buddy, you 
were wrong about number seven." This is an exercise in subjectivity. Right and 
wrong are out the window. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the entries reflect nothing but my own prejudice. But to give this poll 
a veneer of respectability, we asked some of television's best broadcasters for 
their ideas, too. What follows is a collection of baseball broadcast memories, 
in no particular order: 
</P>
<P>
1. Dodger Kirk Gibson's bottom-of-the-9th homer to win the first game of the 
1988 World Series against the Oakland A's tops everyone's list. It should. 
Consider how the stage was set. For most of the game, the injured Gibson is 
nowhere to be seen, not even on the bench. Then he's on the bench. Then out he 
comes with a bat and the crowd stirs. He hobbles to the plate and swings on one 
leg at fastballs he obviously can't handle, against Dennis Eckersley, the 
game's best reliever. Then he catches a slider and lofts it into the seats. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcaster Vin Scully calls it the most theatrical home run he's ever seen. 
"An English writer, Bernard Darwin, talked about the back of the beyond," says 
Scully. "That's where Gibson came from to hit that homer, the back of the 
beyond." 
</P>
<P>
2. The Bill Buckner Incident in the sixth game of the 1986 World Series only 
proves the age-old axiom that one viewer's great moment is another's root 
canal. 
</P>
<P>
Red Sox fans will never forget the sight of Buckner bending his arthritic body 
trying to snare Mookie Wilson's grounder. The Sox were one out away from their 
first Series win since 1918 and, as it has so often in the past, victory simply 
rolled away. The New York Mets won the game, and later the Series. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more than exciting; it was astonishing," says NBC's Bob Costas, who was 
watching from the Boston clubhouse. "Even someone who wasn't rooting for either 
team could feel excitement for the Mets and pain for the Red Sox." 
</P>
<P>
3. Sometimes small moments can be great, too. NBC's Marv Albert was on the 
field after the same game, waiting to interview Ray Knight, who scored the 
winning run. 
</P>
<P>
The field was pandemonium. Knight's wife, pro golfer Nancy Lopez, was standing 
to one side, crying. Seconds before air time, Knight leaned to Albert and said, 
"Hold me up, I feel like I'm going to faint." 
</P>
<P>
Says Albert, "Knight was so shaken by the excitement that I literally had to 
hold him up during the interview." 
</P>
<P>
4. Another epic Red Sox moment was Carlton Fisk's homer in the 12th inning of 
the sixth game of the 1975 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
But just as astonishing was NBC's reaction shot, showing Fisk bunny-hopping 
down the first-base line, using body English to keep the ball fair. Costas says 
that bit of film was significant in broadcasting history because it changed the 
way directors shoot dramatic events. 
</P>
<P>
"After that it became standard procedure to cut to homers and big moments that 
way-with the reaction shot of the batter, cutting to the pitcher as he follows 
the ball, showing the dugout reaction," says Costas. "Remember the shots of 
Lasorda after Kirk Gibson's homer? All that started with Fisk." 
</P>
<P>
5. For broadcaster Harry Caray, greatness usually involves his beloved Cubs. So 
it figures that Caray's great moments are 1984 and 1989, when the Cubs won the 
National League East. Both years Chicago was eliminated in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the closest the Cubs have come to winning a pennant in 46 years," 
bellows the irrepressible Caray. "That's pretty special, don't you think?" If 
Harry says it's so, it's so. 
</P>
<P>
6. When stacked against home runs, pitching performances usually are a distant 
second for fans. But two in particular are unforgettable. The first is Don 
Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 Series. Sure, the film is black and white, 
and grainy, and the players seem tiny and far away, but as Caray says, 
"Pitching a perfect game in the Series is the most impossible feat in 
baseball." Scully agrees. 
</P>
<P>
7. Another is Bob Gibson's 17 strikeouts in the first game of the 1968 World 
Series against Detroit. The Cardinals' right-hander finished the season with a 
phenomenal 1.12 ERA, yet that accomplishment was overshadowed by Tiger pitcher 
Denny McLain's 31 wins. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson's performance, which was against McLain, was a statement. Mets 
broadcaster Tim McCarver, who played for the Carndinals in that game, calls it 
the most exciting game he has ever seen or broadcast. "Gibson was simply 
incredible," says McCarver. 
</P>
<P>
8. The name Reggie Jackson must appear here. But not for his three-homer game 
for the Yankees in the 1977 Series. A more satisfying Jackson moment came in 
the 1978 Series, when Dodger pitcher Bob Welch struck him out to end the second 
game. 
</P>
<P>
It was a lengthy duel: a rookie fireballer against Mr. October. Up in the 
booth, Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek said very little, but what they did say 
blended perfectly with the pictures. "One of the best bits of baseball 
broadcasting I've seen," says Costas. After several foul balls, the 
confrontation ended with a giant swing and a miss and wild cheering. Then the 
cameras zoomed on Reggie. The muscles in his neck bunched as he grimaced. 
Nobody struck out like Reggie Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
9. Another name that demands a spot is Pete Rose. But when he broke Ty Cobb's 
hit record, it was't a great moment. It was expected. He did it, he cried, 
cameras flashed, and viewers around the country strolled to the kitchen for a 
ham sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
The truly defining Rose moment, great for its spectacular absurdity, came in 
the 1970 All-Star Game when the Reds' outfielder nearly killed Ray Fosse in a 
collision at home plate. But Fosse was never the same afterward. And the 
maniacal Rose would never change. For better or worse, the collision was a 
split-second character study of the game's most prolific hitter. 
</P>
<P>
10. Back to home runs. Yes, yes, it's a crime to leave out Bill Mazeroski's 
shot to win the 1960 Series, or Bobby Thompson's belt to win the 1951 playoffs 
for the Giants. But for many, they're remembered as much for the radio 
play-by-play. This is the video age. Which is another way of saying, the Age of 
Bo. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City's Muscled Marvel is in the process of spitting out legends like a 
candy machine. Midway through last season, Jackson hit a home run into the 
third deck in right field at the Metrodome in Minneapolis. It was the longest 
homer ever hit to right field in that stadium-and Jackson is a right-handed 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was about the most exciting thing I've seen since I've been in the booth," 
says Jim Katt, a broadcaster for the Twins who also does baseball color on CBS. 
"The crowd went completely silent. Nobody could believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Surely a big moment. But I'm fond of the time Jackson struck out and was so mad 
he broke the bat over his head. Bo knows wood.

BLOWING THE WHISTLE ON THE EXPERIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1932, news of a new health program was circulated in Macon County, Ala., and 
hundreds of people showed up at black schools and churches for free blood 
tests. Six hundred poor, generally uneducated black males were selected to 
participate, including 399 who had syphilis and 201 who did not. 
</P>
<P>
So began the U.S. Public Health Service's "Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis 
in the Negro Male," a study that lasted for 40 years. During that time, those 
399 sick men were denied treatment and allowed to get progressively sicker -- 
even after penicillin therapy had become commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
Once a year, the men received "a white tablet for pain and a little vial -- I 
guess it was some type of tonic," according to congressional testimony from 
survivor Henrich Shaw in 1973. They underwent blood tests and painful spinal 
taps, but no real treatment for their syphilis; apparently, their autopsies 
were far more important to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
According to further testimony from Shaw and others, these men were never told 
they had the highly infectious disease, much less that they were participating 
in a study that would deny them treatment for it. "I had bad blood," said 
another survivor, "and they said they were working on it." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Vernal G. Cave, then-director of the bureau of venereal disease control at 
the New York City Department of Health and a member of a government-appointed 
panel that reviewed the study, testified in 1973 that even after participants 
began to show grave illness and a death rate nearly double that of control 
subjects, the study continued. After penicillin therapy was in widespread use, 
continued Cave, "whether due to bureaucratic inertia, or zeal to publish more 
papers, or a blocking out of ethical principles or -- and we must consider this 
aspect -- a sinister climate of racism, the study continued." 
</P>
<P>
Cave, now a physician in private practice in Brooklyn, adds today that the 
study was not just morally untenable but scientifically flawed as well. "The 
study was initiated by some people who (failed to) develop careful outlines as 
to what the study should be like and what possibly could be derived from it," 
says Cave, also board chairman of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Family Health Center. 
"That was not done. And throughout the study, there was no consistency. 
Autopsies were done under poor conditions, and there was not good pulling 
together of scientific material." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Peter Buxtun, a Public Health Service employee in San Francisco in the 
'60s, who heard about the study from a colleague and sent off for 
documentation. (The study had been discussed fairly often in "semi-obscure but 
real medical journals," Buxtun told The Times.) He read the materials, felt 
"these were not volunteers but dupes," and sent a letter off to a top Health 
Service official expressing his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
For several more years, Buxtun pressed his case. He spoke to doctors, lawyers 
and journalists. "Nobody listened, " says Buxtun, today an antiques wholesaler. 
"The opaque lids dropped in front of their eyes. Then, finally, in 1972, I was 
out with my pal Edith Lederer, who was a reporter for the Associated Press, and 
she showed the material to her boss, who made her give it to someone on the 
East Coast." 
</P>
<P>
On July 25, AP reporter Jean Heller broke the story, and newspapers around the 
country immediately ran their own articles and editorials. In his highly 
regarded book about the study, "Bad Blood," historian James H. Jones cited 
assorted headlines that charged everything from "Nightmare Experiment" to 
"Official Inhumanity." A later article in Ebony Magazine blared: "Condemned to 
Die for Science." The study was halted, a government-appointed advisory group 
put it under review, and several months later Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) 
held a series of hearings on human experimentation that kept the issue in the 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
Survivor Charles Pollard, meanwhile, had contacted attorney Fred Gray, and in 
July, 1973, Gray filed a $1.8-billion class-action suit. Gray, who had attained 
national prominence by first defending Rosa Parks in 1955, then the Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr. a while later, settled the suit out of court. According to 
Jones, who had helped Gray on the case, the government agreed to pay about $10 
million. The sum of $37,500 was to go to any syphilitic subject still living, 
with varying lesser sums to control subjects and heirs. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who is still in practice in Tuskegee, spent the next several years trying 
to find those people. According to press reports in 1981, he and his staff 
found nearly everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Jones says very few Public Health Service officials refused interviews for his 
book, "Bad Blood." The historian, today an associate professor of history at 
the University of Houston, says some officials were even eager to talk "because 
they felt the press had no appreciation for what was involved and were using a 
1970s moral prism through which to view something from an earlier time." 
</P>
<P>
With Gray's help, Jones was also able to interview half-a-dozen survivors on 
tape and for the record, and others off the record. But the most important oral 
history he did, Jones says, was with nurse Eunice Rivers, the woman who stayed 
with the project throughout nearly its entirety and who "suggested" playwright 
David Feldshuh's Nurse Eunice Evers. After nearly a year of pursuit, she 
finally agreed to meet with him, and Jones was able to interview her over 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
How did Rivers feel about her assignment? "I would like to think there was more 
ambivalence at the time but I'm not sure there was," says Jones. "A variety of 
factors made it very difficult for her to see the experiment in moral terms 
(such as) the nurse-patient relationship -- she was taught to equate good 
nursing with following the doctor's orders." 
</P>
<P>
But Rivers eventually spoke with considerable candor, he says, and it became 
clear "that the explosion of negative publicity that greeted the public 
disclosure of the experiment had grieved and wounded her deeply. I think she 
had always seen herself as a moral woman and always found it possible to view 
her role in a benevolent light. I have moral certainty that she loved the men 
in the study." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who is now writing a biography of sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey, 
indicates Feldshuh isn't the first person to see dramatic potential in the 
Tuskegee study. A film option on "Bad Blood" in the early '80s fell through, he 
says, but he signed a second option two years ago with a New York-based film 
producer. Negotiations on that project, he says, are "current and ongoing" in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Jones says he hasn't seen Feldshuh's play, "but I think that a theatrical drama 
is a good vehicle to put these issues before the public so that the dialogue 
can continue." And so does producing director Bonnie Morris at Minneapolis' 
220-seat Illusion Theater, which hosted three readings of the play. "The arts 
is one of those places where we can have a collective memory," says Morris. 
"The way we make sure these things don't happen again is that we don't forget 
them."

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
MASSIMO IOSA-GHINI, based in Bologna, Italy, helped write a manifesto in 1982 
that exhorted designers to "break the reign of the angular line" and "find once 
more the sinuous curve." Bolidismo is derived from bolide, the Italian word for 
a fast-moving object (such as a speeding bullet), or an object whose appearance 
implies speed. 
</P>
<P>
Iosa-Ghini followed up his Bolidist manifesto with an appealing series of 
chairs, cabinets and table-top accessories for such marques as Memphis and 
Moroso. The pieces combine the exuberance of his early work as a set designer 
and cartoonist with a smiling look back at 20th-Century design influences -- 
including futurism (the avant-garde movement preceding World War I that 
romanced the wind-swept, streamlined look of ships, bridges and airplanes); 
Buck Rogers ('30s and '40s science fiction), and '50s moderne (furniture with 
skinny, pointy legs). On an architectural scale, he created Bolido, a New York 
nightclub and restaurant that boasts sweeping stair rails, murals of spaceships 
(or are they ocean liners?) and a bar seemingly poised for takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
Iosa-Ghini's Collezione Bolidista furniture for Moroso includes the Curva 
pullup chair (about $600), the big upholstered Balzo armchair (about $2,500) 
and the Plana bench (about $1,600). 
</P>

TEN YEARS AGO, carpenter Ciro C. Coppa needed wooden screen doors. He couldn't 
find them. "I started making them for remodeling jobs," he says, "because 
putting an aluminum screen door on a woodsy house wasn't right -- a wood screen 
door just fits these houses. 
</P>
<P>
And then friends and neighbors started asking me to do it for them. I made up 
the screen designs in my head to go along with the design of the house." 
</P>
<P>
The old-style doors were a hit; Coppa now employs 15 workers at his San Pedro 
shop and turns out about 10,000 screen doors a year. Standard-size doors, which 
come in styles ranging from 3/4-length oval screens to split-panels with 
decorative etching, cost from $34 to $70 for 3/4-inch-thick sugar pine 
versions, $95 to $140 for 3/4-inch solid oak (custom sizes cost $15 extra). 
Thicker doors are available, as are double-door kits. 
</P>
<P>
The shop also produces pine window screens for older houses (prices range from 
$10 to $60). Screen orders provide some of the more interesting requests for 
custom work, Coppa says. One example: "A guy with a Victorian mansion wanted a 
second-story window screen that was 6-feet wide and 8-feet tall with an arched 
top. You needed a pilot's license to measure it. I like to take on unusual 
requests like that. I love the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Coppa Woodworking offers its screen doors and window screens through window and 
door stores throughout Southern California, as well as in its shop. "Actually, 
there's no showroom to speak of," Coppa says. "We're more interested in the 
woodworking. This is bare bones; we try to keep prices reasonable."

A flash fire eight levels below the flight deck of the aircraft carrier 
Saratoga injured three civilian welders and a sailor, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the injuries were life-threatening. Damage to the ship docked at 
Mayport Naval Station, Fla., was minimal and the fire burned itself out almost 
immediately, officials said. The Saratoga is based at Mayport and carries a 
crew of about 5,000 when fully staffed. It has been undergoing minor repairs 
since returning in June from training operations along the Eastern seaboard.

NATIONAL NUDE WEEKEND MARKED BY PROTEST, PARTIES; 
</P>
<P>
NATURISTS: A FLORIDA WOMAN IS ARRESTED WEARING ONLY A COPY OF THE BILL OF 
RIGHTS. A NUDIST RESORT OPENS ITS DOORS TO VISITORS.

Naturists celebrated National Nude Weekend Saturday, shedding their clothes in 
Florida to protest a recent crackdown on thong bathing suits and mingling with 
non-believers to show that nudists are normal people, too. 
</P>
<P>
One woman protesting the thong ban was arrested in a Palm Beach area public 
park after stripping off what little she was wearing and covering her body with 
a large copy of the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
T. A. Wyner of Loxahatchee arrived at the protest wearing a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
While circulating petitions calling for the protection of the First Amendment, 
Wyner stripped off her T-shirt and revealed only the Bill of Rights clutched to 
her front. 
</P>
<P>
"She had told us she wanted to be arrested, so we accommodated her," said Randy 
Lewis, a Department of Natural Resources spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected that they would acknowledge that there is a First Amendment, that 
the First Amendment is my permit to express myself the way that I choose," 
Wyner said. 
</P>
<P>
At Cypress Cove Resort, a nudist recreation center in Kissimmee, Fla., rain 
washed out nude water-skiing and a host of planned outdoor activities. 
</P>
<P>
But resort owner Jim Hadley said the storms hadn't dampened spirits of about 
300 members and guests who took shelter in a restaurant for square dancing and 
jazz band performances. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our members are nude and are mingling with the guests who are not, and 
there doesn't seem to be any conflict," Hadley said. 
</P>
<P>
"What our visitors are finding is they are people like us." 
</P>
<P>
National Nude Weekend is the only time non-members are allowed to enter the 
260-acre private Cypress Cove Resort, the largest of its kind in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend for those in the nation who enjoy being in the buff is sponsored by 
the Oshkosh, Wis.-based Naturist Society and the American Sunbathing Assn. in 
Kissimmee. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Burich, executive director of the Naturist Society, predicted Friday that 
thousands of Americans and Canadians would descend upon beaches, hideaways in 
wooded areas and other special places during the weekend -- sans clothing.

A PLACE FOR HOUSEHOLD WASTES; 
</P>
<P>
NEW COLLECTION CENTER WILL ACCEPT WHAT MOTHER NATURE MAY NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having motor oil, paints, pesticides and other toxics around the house can 
really add up. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Orange County estimate that each household generates about 7.5 
pounds of hazardous waste per year, for a total of about 3,000 tons per year in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
But what to do with it all? 
</P>
<P>
Many places around the country in recent years, Orange County included, have 
held hazardous waste collection days for the environmentally conscious 
homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
That's all to the good. 
</P>
<P>
The public response has been heartening, too, a sign that many people 
understand the dangers posed by illegal dumping of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even the best intentions can result in frayed nerves for the people 
stuck waiting in line to leave their items on rare collection days. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County now has a good answer -- it has opened its first permanent 
collection center for hazardous waste in Anaheim, giving residents the best 
legal alternative for disposal of toxic materials. 
</P>
<P>
Free of charge, residents can drop off household materials at 2761 E. White 
Star Ave. from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
The site is one of six expected to open in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Others are to open by the end of the summer in San Juan Capistrano, Huntington 
Beach, Brea and Stanton, and the county is looking for a location in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim center is located on property already used as a commercial garbage 
transfer station, and serves as a collection point. From there, the waste will 
be hauled to special toxic-waste landfills, disposal sites, or recycling 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors, which approved the funding for household waste 
centers last year, is to be congratulated for having the vision to go ahead 
with this project. 
</P>
<P>
The center signals the county's willingness to help keep hazardous materials 
out of sewers or storm drains, where they end up damaging the environment.

'VOTERS GIVE CONGRESSMEN GOOD REVIEWS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The impression one gets from the results of the Times Orange County Poll on 
voters' attitudes toward Orange County congressmen ("O.C. Voters Give 
Congressmen Good Reviews," July 9) is not that these lawmakers are popular, but 
that their performance is predominantly uninspiring. 
</P>
<P>
While it is true, for example, that Dannemeyer received the highest favorable 
rating (33% of those polled), 67% of voters either had no opinion of him or 
found him unfavorable. Opinions regarding the other congressmen showed even 
greater indifference. What this all seems to say is that what is truly 
conservative about Orange County is not necessarily its politics, but its 
enthusiasm for its politicians.

'MOST MISERLY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I resented very much your front-page headline (June 30) "Orange County Among 
Most Wealthy, Miserly in U.S.," but became totally incensed when I turned to 
Page A18 and found the second portion of your article headlined, "Survey: O.C. 
Among Wealthiest, Cheapest." 
</P>
<P>
"Miserly" and "cheap" are harsh words that connote meanness and selfishness. 
</P>
<P>
Simply because Orange County is not beset with social problems as severe as 
those of many other counties across America is no reason for your editors to 
assail the character of an entire county's citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone familiar with Orange County knows that our needs for "human service" and 
"public safety" spending should not be among the highest in the nation, 
although, according to the survey, they are above the national average. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you have solid information to the contrary, you should use adjectives 
like "frugal," "economical" or "prudent" when describing Orange County 
taxpayers!

GIVING SOS A CHANCE TO OPEN ITS DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Costa Mesa's response to Share Our Selves' relocation is pathetically 
small-minded and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than hire a private investigator and set up a hot line to uncover 
possible grievances, why don't the neighbors volunteer their time at the center 
and get to know the people it serves? 
</P>
<P>
Then, perhaps, they might understand the difficult circumstances under which 
others live and appreciate them for who they are: men, women and children who 
are trying to make ends meet in an expensive county that is unequivocally the 
most tightfisted in terms of charitable contributions and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of assuming the worst, why don't the neighbors and business owners work 
with SOS in developing a productive relationship that resolves conflicts before 
they arise and meets everyone's needs in the process? 
</P>
<P>
This seems to be a much more humane and cost-effective solution than the 
adversarial one proposed before SOS even opens its doors.

BOWL WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
NAME OF THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are some game plans where it's best to punt early. Don't wait for fourth 
down to kick; play for better field position and a chance to cut your losses. 
</P>
<P>
It was third down and miles to go in Anaheim this past week when Don Andersen, 
director of the Freedom Bowl, a holiday-season football bowl game, made such a 
strategic decision. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with possibly the most lukewarm reception ever given a proposal for the 
name of a bowl game, the promoter decided wisely to drop back and punt on an 
idea to rename the bowl "The Orange County Freedom From Drugs Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was well-intentioned enough. The bowl game needs money to 
attract better teams, and the director thought he had a way to get backing from 
Orange County at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen went so far as to meet with county Supervisor Don R. Roth and Sheriff 
Brad Gates to see if the county might be willing to put up $800,000 seized in 
drug raids to sponsor the game. 
</P>
<P>
There would be an anti-drug message on national television in exchange for 
sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
But not every play that may look good on some coach's blackboard has results 
when tried out on the playing field. By last week, the plan to enlist the 
county didn't have much of a cheering section at all. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal only served to highlight the need for drug education and treatment 
money, and contrasted it with the perception of an extravagant spectacle.

COSTA MESA COUNCIL AND CENSORSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The entire National Endowment for the Arts incident has made my blood boil. 
Crime is a very scary thing to think about, but censorship is deeply 
terrifying. 
</P>
<P>
Now I read that the Costa Mesa City Council is also considering censorship. 
This time I felt sickened. The ruling from Washington affects everyone in this 
country, but this latest attempt on banning is right in my own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
I am an artist and have been to many exhibits and performances in Orange County 
and Los Angeles. I've had the opportunity to take for granted the freedom of 
letting myself, for myself, be the sole judge of a work of art. Some mesmerize 
me into a state of tranquility, some I find boring, ugly, outrageously fun, 
weird or confusing. 
</P>
<P>
These are my opinions and thoughts. Other people may have different opinions 
and that is part of what makes the world go around and it allows me to think 
and learn. 
</P>
<P>
May I express to Mayor Peter F. Buffa and the Costa Mesa City Council that I 
have a mind of my own and don't care to use theirs. If I don't like something, 
I don't have to see it again. Please, oh, please, give me the freedom this 
country has always tried to uphold. Preserve the freedom of choice for 
everyone, not just for you. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as an elected official, Buffa would better spend his energies on giving 
people rights rather than taking them away. Has the mayor noticed the homeless 
situation? They do have the same rights as all of us with a place to live, but 
they may have difficulty exercising their right to vote since they have no 
mailing address to receive a sample ballot or voters pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not forget we are in America where we struggle to preserve freedoms. If 
you disagree with this, then please board the quickest flight to a country 
without freedom of speech. Perhaps with that head start, you can begin working 
hard toward revoking all kinds of other freedoms.

IN A COOLER CLIMATE, GARDEN GROVE'S ETHNIC STRAINS UNWIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA CONSIDINE, Barbara Considine is a staff specialist for the Orange 
County Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman steps to the podium to express her anger about the abundance of foreign 
language signs in the city. A Korean man comes forward to protest a proposed 
ordinance requiring the English language on business signs. 
</P>
<P>
The place is Garden Grove, and the issue spawns a heated debate that stretches 
well into the evening, punctuated by occasional fist pounding, exasperated 
sighs from the audience, discourses on civil rights and the English-only 
initiative, and accusations and counter-accusations of discrimination. 
Anti-Asian hate flyers mysteriously fill the City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, 15 people are gathered in a circle, sipping coffee and 
nibbling on egg rolls in a Korean-owned carpet shop on Garden Grove Boulevard, 
the pulse of the Korean merchant and social center of Orange County. They are 
there for the third session of a dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Human Relations Commission, with support from the city of 
Garden Grove and the Korean Chamber of Commerce, brought together this group of 
Korean merchants and Anglo residents to reduce simmering tensions and discuss 
issues of mutual concern. Many are the same players from the council chambers, 
but in a different setting and working under different rules. 
</P>
<P>
A Korean immigrant explains to the group how in spite of his 20-plus years in 
the United States and his U.S. education, he never entirely forgets that he is 
different. He has an Asian face and speaks with an accent; he's always a little 
bit an outsider. Hence the love for "Koreatown," a kind of emotional/social 
sanctuary where one can breathe the luxurious air of an insider for a few 
minutes each day. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime Garden Grove resident talks about feeling like an outsider in 
"Koreatown." Being American is about being united as one community, she says, 
not creating separate clusters within a city. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove, once dotted with orange groves and home to the annual Strawberry 
Festival, was already stretching beyond its rural, small-town roots well before 
the Korean immigrants began to arrive in the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran residents point to the construction of the Garden Grove Freeway as the 
beginning of the end of Garden Grove Boulevard as a thriving hometown business 
district. The boulevard slumped into economic decline, and the Koreans, like so 
many immigrants before them, discovered in the boulevard a tremendous 
opportunity to prosper and be self-sufficient in their adopted land. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that not one of the participating Korean merchants is a resident of 
Garden Grove raised a sore point: Outsiders. What is the acid test, 
participants wondered, for loyalty to one's community? Does one who owns 
commercial property have less of a stake in a community than one who owns 
residential property? How long must one reside in a community to establish a 
sincere commitment? One interesting discovery from the dialogue: The mayor is 
the only native-born resident of Garden Grove in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Differing cultural values can also create tension. For example, immigrants have 
an intense drive to succeed, for their children to succeed. Assumption: 
Native-born Americans are not hard-working, not goal-oriented, don't care if 
their children get an education. Assumption: Koreans are elitist, too 
status-driven. 
</P>
<P>
Participants adjust the focus on their cultural lenses for a moment. "Of course 
we want good things for ourselves and our children. But there are many 
definitions of success," an Anglo participant says to agreeing nods. "I 
understand," a Korean man responds. "But this broader interpretation of success 
is a luxury for a new immigrant. Perhaps for the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
And what about senior citizens? The American institution of nursing homes 
becomes a topic for discussion. Koreans explain traditional Asian values of 
respect for elders and the extended family unit. Assumption: Americans don't 
care about their elders, don't have a strong commitment to family. 
Anglo-Americans share emotional anecdotes about the frustration, the pain in 
choices made for aging parents, about exploring innovative solutions to 
shortcomings in today's elderly care. A critical value, they point out, is 
independence, to not be a burden to one's adult children. 
</P>
<P>
One Korean member mentions that local Korean leaders are exploring options for 
elderly housing, because, given the alternative, many Korean elders would 
rather be on their own. The imaginary lines that divide "us" from "them" begin 
to blur. 
</P>
<P>
In another session, dialogue members talked about awarenesses that had been 
created as a result of the meetings. "I found that Americans were more 
generous, kinder than I had thought before," one participant said in a 
statement seconded by other Koreans. Their original, negative impression was no 
doubt helped along by their experiences in City Council debates. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the lines blur as to who is the insider and who is the outsider. 
</P>
<P>
One of the future challenges for the dialogue members will be to explore how to 
help the Korean and Anglo communities adjust the focus on their lenses as well, 
to move beyond assumptions about culture or newcomers versus old-timers and 
work together to reduce community tensions. 
</P>
<P>
A similar challenge, or opportunity, exists for Orange County in general. Just 
as Garden Grove Boulevard is no longer what it was before the freeway, so too 
has the county's face changed in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors created the Human Relations Commission to 
transform inter-ethnic conflicts into opportunities to build strength from our 
differences. We can accept our growing diversity and work to develop mutual 
respect and understanding, or we can stubbornly cling to old ideas that will 
lead us down the path to inter-ethnic conflict and violence.

WOULD A LUXURY 'FACILITY' AT CHECKPOINT REALLY HELP THE INS CATCH MORE ALIENS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It appears that the Border Patrol is trying its darnedest to convince us that 
to do their job more effectively, they really need a luxurious new landmark 
headquarters "facility" and resort on the finest stretch of Southern California 
Riviera coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Who is the Immigration and Naturalization Service trying to kid? 
</P>
<P>
Even if they did intensive checkpoint activity at the San Clemente Border 
Patrol checkpoint every day of the year, they would nab only 350,000 illegals 
if last Sunday's effort represents a true picture. 
</P>
<P>
But that effort was paid for dearly by all U.S. citizens who just wanted to 
spend their weekend in the Southland, not be detained for hours backed up for 
more than five miles while the Border Patrol played "catch the illegals" 60 
miles away from where they could be 10 times more effective. 
</P>
<P>
Every person detained for more than a few moments had his constitutional rights 
violated. When are the citizens going to wake up and see that the checkpoint is 
a burdensome, absurd, Border Patrol boondoggle that is really very ineffective 
at halting illegal aliens from entering our nation? Imagine a $30-million 
resort "facility" dedicated to this folly! 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, Interstate 5 offers four northbound lanes. The Border Patrol 
normally shuts down one or two lanes of traffic, funneling cars to a standstill 
at the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did they create a massive traffic jam, they needed helicopters and men 
roaming the territory from the beach to inland Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
If they applied that kind of manpower along the real border, they could 
probably catch 10 times as many illegals in half the time.

MORNING BRIEFING: CASH IN CLASS A: NOT CHIPPER WITH CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a fan of the Batavia, N.Y., Clippers, the Philadelphia Phillies' 
Class A team in the New York-Penn League, you already know that former manager 
Dave Cash has been reassigned to his previous position as a roving minor league 
infield instructor. The Phillies' former All-Star second baseman was the 
Clippers' manager for less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
Stuff happens. But how? 
</P>
<P>
During a game with Oneonta last Monday night, the view of the field for Cash's 
wife, Pamela, was blocked by the team's mascot, Chipper the Clipper, a 
blue-feathered, yellow-beaked Big Bird sort of creature. 
</P>
<P>
She said she asked Chipper to move, then tapped him on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"He shook his behind in my face in front of my two young children," Pamela Cash 
said. "I thought that kind of behavior by a mascot at what's supposed to be a 
family-oriented place was totally uncalled for. This wasn't the first time he 
shook his butt in my face." 
</P>
<P>
She said she then got into a fight about the incident with a club official. 
</P>
<P>
Cash commented on his brief tenure as manager: "From my perspective, we 
experienced a lot of rudeness. It's best that we no longer are in this 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which NFL quarterback attempted the most passes in 1989? 
</P>
<P>
Postponed, darkness: Thursday, nine months after an earthquake measuring 7.1 on 
the Richter scale hit the Bay Area, Seton Medical Center in San Francisco 
reported a 25% increase in births. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only surmise that the two must be connected," said Dr. Gwen Marcus, 
director of nurseries at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned for the birth statistics nine months after the resumption of the 
Giants-A's World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Sartorial supremacy: An item in Saturday's Morning Briefing noted that Inside 
Sports has rated UCLA's home uniforms third best in college football. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's top two: "1. Florida State. The combination of garnet and gold 
is macho but not macabre, and the helmet design is one of the most distinctive 
around. 2. Michigan. Really now -- is there a more discernible symbol in 
college football than the maize-and-blue's winged headgear?" 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute: Memo to Inside Sports' fact-checkers: Wolverines have wings? 
</P>
<P>
Perfect agreement: National League umpire Eric Gregg, interviewed Friday on 
National Public Radio's "Fresh Air," recounted a time he called a Dodger 
baserunner out at second in front of a sellout crowd at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The play wasn't close, Gregg said, but when he looked up he saw manager Tom 
Lasorda charging out of the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg: "Lasorda says to me, 'Are we on national TV?' I said, 'No.' He said, 
'OK, let's go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add Gregg: Asked how he calls a play at first base, he said that he watches the 
runner's foot touch the bag and listens for the sound of the ball in the first 
baseman's mitt. 
</P>
<P>
Could he remember when this technique failed him? 
</P>
<P>
"One time I blinked," Gregg said. "You pick one. You can't tell if it's right 
or wrong. 'Uh-oh. Here they come . . . No one comes . . . I guess I got that 
one right.' "

COVER STORY: ODD COUPLE, ODD SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
'QUANTUM LEAP' IS SCOTT BAKULA'S IDEA OF AN ACTOR'S DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It happens, every so often, that an actor comes upon a role that permits him to 
explore a strange new life. Dustin Hoffman put on a bra for "Tootsie." Daniel 
Day-Lewis was born with cerebral palsy in "My Left Foot." Tom Cruise lost the 
use of his legs in "Born on the Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
For some actors, such choice roles come once in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
For Scott Bakula, they come along about once a week. 
</P>
<P>
In the NBC series "Quantum Leap," which is in reruns on Wednesday nights at 10 
p.m., the 35-year-old actor has assumed the body of a mentally disabled man, a 
to-die-for female secretary, an elderly black in the pre-civil rights South, an 
alcoholic schoolteacher at an all-girls college and a teen-age hot-rodder in 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably be a dog someday," Bakula said thoughtfully. "I'd like to be a 
baby in a big, oversized crib. I mean, we can do anything on this show. I want 
to be homeless. And I hope to do an AIDS story. I'd like to have AIDS, yeah. I 
think that would be good." 
</P>
<P>
"Quantum Leap," a time-travel odyssey and a hit with critics, is patiently 
waiting to find its audience. Despite poor ratings, the show was renewed early 
for 22 new episodes next season on the basis of its quality by an ever-hopeful 
Brandon Tartikoff, the president of NBC Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly series finds Bakula the victim of a weird science experiment gone 
awry. His character, Sam, helplessly bounces back and forth in the years from 
his birth to his death, quantum leaping each week into a new body with a 
different mission. Dean Stockwell plays Al, Bakula's partner on the misfired 
experiment, who gives counsel from beyond as a helpful hologram. 
</P>
<P>
In each episode, Bakula appears as himself. He can only catch a glimpse of the 
bodies he inhabits by looking at his reflection in a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
"My role is an acting tour de force," Bakula said, reinforcing his solid 
all-American persona with polite words and enthusiasm. He was seated in his 
dressing room on a lunch break from the Columbia Pictures comedy "Sibling 
Rivalry," his first feature film, in which he plays Kirstie Alley's husband. 
</P>
<P>
Bakula had just unraveled his career like a colorful ball of yarn -- from his 
Broadway debut a decade ago as Joe DiMaggio in "Marilyn: An American Fable," to 
his two short-lived sitcoms, ABC's "Gung Ho" (1986-87) and CBS' "Eisenhower 
&amp; Lutz" (1988), to his Tony nomination two years ago for the musical 
"Romance, Romance." 
</P>
<P>
"Not just the theater experience, but my whole life is contributing to 'Quantum 
Leap,' " he said, "because we keep finding little things for me to do or 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
Among Bakula's "Quantum" feats: He sang in three episodes -- as a theatrical 
understudy to the lead in "The Man of La Mancha," as an old black pool player 
crooning a gospel tune and as an Italian hit man belting out "Volare." 
</P>
<P>
Bakula played his own piano as a blind pianist in one episode. He danced the 
tango in another. And he performed many of his own stunts as a trapeze artist, 
boxer and football player. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any other actors who could have done what he did," said 
"Quantum Leap's" creator and executive producer, Don Bellisario. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, it was a very demanding year," Bellisario continued. "What most 
people don't realize, and what we take for granted, I guess, is Scott's genuine 
acting ability. Every week he plays a different character, a different role. 
And he plays each one with an arc, with its own subtle nuances." 
</P>
<P>
"Quantum Leap," scheduled for Friday nights next season, debuted as a 
mid-season replacement in 1989. It's something of an anomaly in television -- a 
science-fiction, anthology and weekly drama series all time-warped into one. Of 
those three genres, however, only the weekly drama can be counted on to attract 
a wide viewership. 
</P>
<P>
"Don Bellisario has created a situation where he can basically do an anthology 
time-travel show, (yet) get away from the curse of the anthology because Dean 
and I are there every week," Bakula said. "We have two characters who the 
audience can hopefully get really involved with, and the science-fiction angle 
lets us put them in totally unique situations." 
</P>
<P>
But the problem is most audiences don't even know Sam and Al. Among 111 
prime-time network programs last season, "Quantum Leap" tied for obscurity at 
No. 72 with Valerie Harper's sitcom, "City." 
</P>
<P>
NBC focus groups have shown that even the title, "Quantum Leap," is a deterrent 
because it sounds too sci-fi, though once people sit down and watch the show 
they are pleasantly surprised. To recruit new viewers, Tartikoff aired an 
episode a night for five straight weeknights at the end of last month. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of belief in the show by Brandon, and the show has survived 
because of Brandon," said Bellisario, who also created and produced "Magnum, 
P.I." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it would take a while for an audience to latch on and understand the 
concept," Bellisario said. "It used to be that you gave a show a chance. You 
gave it a run. That's what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Bellisario already is assembling a fresh new cast of characters for the 
multitalented Bakula to step inside next season -- his own body as a 
16-year-old kid, a female beauty pageant contestant, a black boy during the 
Watts riots who is in love with a white girl, a motorcycle gang member, a 
Chippendale stripper, a priest and, possibly, a gay man. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a desperate need in television for shows that are different," 
Bellisario said. "I think that's what all the noise last season was over 'Twin 
Peaks.' Something different. That's what's kept us afloat. We're a very, very 
different show."

Q &amp; A: RICK DEES WAGES WAR 'INTO THE NIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Rick Dees, the wisecracking morning host on KIIS-FM (102.7) who scraped 
past his competitors in the last Arbitron ratings to regain his position as 
L.A.'s top drive-time radio personality, the competition is getting even 
stiffer. 
</P>
<P>
Ken and Bob will be the least of Dees' concerns Monday at midnight, when he's 
up against much bigger names -- Johnny, Arsenio and Dave -- in his new 
Monday-through-Friday show on ABC, "Into the Night Starring Rick Dees." 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, many of the network's 200-plus affiliates didn't want Dees' crazy 
new weeknight show, which features local jazz group Billy Vera and the Beaters 
as its house band. Some affiliates opted to keep the post-"Nightline" slot open 
for local and syndicated programming. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, however, believed in Dees' antics and offered its affiliates a bigger 
slice of the advertising pie if they'd take the show. Most bit, and "Into the 
Night" is set to air in about 90% of ABC's markets. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's up to Rigdon Osmond Dees III, alias Rick, to wow them on TV like he 
has on radio. The boyish 40-year-old first entertained a national audience as a 
Memphis deejay in 1976 with his smash novelty hit, "Disco Duck." He was the 
host of the syndicated TV show "Solid Gold" in 1983-84 and currently hosts 
"Rick Dees' Weekly Top 40" on national radio. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Dees reportedly earns a salary of about $2 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
So why a night job? Daniel Cerone recently discussed the changes with him. 
</P>
<P>
How did you make the leap from radio to television? 
</P>
<P>
This has been a dream in the making for about five years, at least. I came up 
with a concept for a show and have been pitching it to several people for the 
past few years, even to the point of putting my own pilot together two years 
ago. ABC tested the pilot with audiences, and luckily for all of us it did real 
well. Then it went through the channels at ABC. It took a while. I kind of felt 
like a fine wine gathering dust on a shelf. But in November, we shot a second 
pilot for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
What is the concept behind "Into the Night"? 
</P>
<P>
I wanted a show that was not just guest-driven. We'll have regular comedy 
features and bits, sprinkled with top superstars in entertainment and the 
hottest music acts around. And some surprise elements, where we jump out of the 
bushes and throw some money out at you. The overall feeling of the show is that 
anything can happen. We want you to feel good about being up at such an ungodly 
hour. We're not into making you feel bad, or making our guests feel stupid. 
</P>
<P>
You have a nationally syndicated radio show. Are you a known commodity across 
the country? 
</P>
<P>
In the testing they did for this, the answer is: It appears that I have 
scratched and clawed my way to the middle. I'm not that well-known. Maybe 
that's good. I'm not perceived as being the host of some show. I'm just a guy 
who loves to get up in front of people and act like a fool. In the testings, a 
lot of people just didn't know who I was. 
</P>
<P>
The late-night arena is so competitive. What are your show's chances of 
success? 
</P>
<P>
I'm so much the underdog. I don't feel that's bad to say. I've worked at this 
so long, it's not something that's just happened out of the blue. But let's 
face it, the show is just starting. Every other show that's on late night now 
has been on for a long time. They are the standards by which everybody measures 
late-night shows, and I'm starting in a spot where there are no established 
ratings for ABC. There's zero. So point one is an improvement. But I'm sure the 
brass at ABC expects bigger than that." 
</P>
<P>
If "Into the Night" is a success, will you give up being a local deejay? 
</P>
<P>
I cringe when I see myself described as a deejay. Because that's the term that 
we put on Alan Freed back in the 1950s. I just put a comedy show on a 
microphone that happens to go out on the radio. In television, I do the exact 
same thing, the same comedy. I think in terms of what Bob Hope used to do, Jack 
Benny used to do. They never called them deejays, they were hosts. That's what 
I feel I am. A guy who plays records all day, "This is Madonna, and next up, 
Michael Jackson," that's a deejay. 
</P>
<P>
Will you give up being a radio host then? 
</P>
<P>
I love radio so much, and I love television so much, it's easy for me to make 
them coexist. I love being busy. So I always want to be doing everything I can. 
I'm also a volunteer fireman, and I sell Amway and Herbalife. 
</P>
<P>
No, that's a joke. To tell you the truth, it's just so much fun to do the radio 
shows, and I do them so fast. It's not brain surgery for me. I go out there and 
knock them off. It's my hobby. I get the biggest thrill out of it.

MIKE DOWNEY: FIVE WEEKS THAT WERE ARE TOUGH TO ACCEPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Five weeks out of the country can do strange things to a guy. 
</P>
<P>
When I left for the World Cup, evidently I lost all touch with what was going 
on back home. For example, I just got a phone call from my friend, Kay Talk. 
This is not her real name. I call her Kay Talk because she talks more than an 
all-news radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"Glad you're back," Kay said. "Did you enjoy the soccer?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," I said. "Did you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, sure," she said. "I especially liked the game where somebody scored a 
goal. I forget when it was. June-something." 
</P>
<P>
"So, what else is new?" I made the mistake of asking. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, how about all those no-hitters?" Kay asked. 
</P>
<P>
"What no-hitters?" 
</P>
<P>
"Whaddaya mean, 'What no-hitters?' Seven of them. Seven no-hitters." 
</P>
<P>
"Get outta here." 
</P>
<P>
"No, seriously." 
</P>
<P>
"There haven't been seven no-hitters in seven years," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Wanna bet?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah? No-hitters by who?" 
</P>
<P>
"Whom. Well, Fernando, for one." 
</P>
<P>
"Fernando whom?" 
</P>
<P>
"Who. Whaddaya mean, 'Fernando who?' How many Fernandos you know?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you can't mean Valenzuela." 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because before I left, Fernando Valenzuela couldn't have no-hit Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he no-hit St. Louis," Kay said. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Louis who?" 
</P>
<P>
"And Nolan Ryan threw a no-hitter, too." 
</P>
<P>
"That I believe." 
</P>
<P>
"That guy is RoboPitcher, man." 
</P>
<P>
"Who else?" 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, Andy Hawkins threw one." 
</P>
<P>
"In what league?" 
</P>
<P>
"Against the White Sox. Except he lost, 4-0." 
</P>
<P>
"A guy threw a no-hitter and lost, 4-0? I don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
"He pitches for the Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
"Now I understand." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, and then there were the Perez brothers." 
</P>
<P>
"What about the Perez brothers?" 
</P>
<P>
"Melido Perez of the White Sox threw a no-hitter, just like his brother Pascual 
once did." 
</P>
<P>
"Two brothers threw no-hitters?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah. Isn't that the weirdest thing you've ever heard?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are they Siamese twins?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
"Then it's not the weirdest thing I've ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
"Neither game went longer than seven innings." 
</P>
<P>
"Did Melido's involve the Yankees?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"If you had to play for the Yankees, would you want to play longer than seven 
innings?" 
</P>
<P>
"Good point." 
</P>
<P>
"Anything else happen?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Whitey Herzog quit." 
</P>
<P>
"As manager of the St. Louis Cardinals?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, as manager of a 7-Eleven. Of course as manager of the St. Louis 
Cardinals." 
</P>
<P>
"Why? Because they got no-hit by Fernando?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so. Oh, and Jack McKeon's not the manager in San Diego anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"Did he trade himself?" 
</P>
<P>
"No. But there was a rumor that San Diego was going to trade for Bo Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
"In what sport?" 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I don't blame them. Bo's an All-Star." 
</P>
<P>
"No, he isn't." 
</P>
<P>
"He isn't?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, Bo didn't make the All-Star team. Matter of fact, nobody who's anybody 
made the All-Star team." 
</P>
<P>
"Who did make the All-Star team?" 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff Brantley. Gregg Olson. Some other Greg Olson. Rob Dibble. Sandy Alomar. 
Jack Armstrong . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"No, seriously." 
</P>
<P>
"I am serious." 
</P>
<P>
"You picked those names out of the phone book." 
</P>
<P>
"No, I picked those names out of the All-Star game box score." 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard of more guys on the Argentine soccer team." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll bet." 
</P>
<P>
"Was it a no-hitter?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, but you're close." 
</P>
<P>
"How did Devon White do?" 
</P>
<P>
"Devon White's in the minors." 
</P>
<P>
"How about Mark Langston?" 
</P>
<P>
"Langston's won four games." 
</P>
<P>
"What place are the Angels in -- eighth?" 
</P>
<P>
"They're still behind Oakland and the White Sox." 
</P>
<P>
"The White Sox?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah. Even Oakland was behind the White Sox last week." 
</P>
<P>
"Uh oh. Those White Sox must be fixing things with the gamblers again." 
</P>
<P>
"What?" 
</P>
<P>
"Have any Oakland players come into a lot of money lately?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Jose Canseco did get $23.5 million." 
</P>
<P>
"From Oakland? Oakland doesn't have $23.5 million. If Oakland had $23.5 
million, it would have pro football." 
</P>
<P>
Kay said: "That's about all you missed while you were gone." 
</P>
<P>
"OK." 
</P>
<P>
"I assume you already heard about Pat Riley quitting the Lakers, Hale Irwin 
winning the U.S. Open and Martina Navratilova winning Wimbledon." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, right," I said. "And Magic Johnson joined the Peace Corps, Jack Nicklaus 
became a Hare Krishna and Steffi Graf is mud-wrestling at the Tropicana." 
</P>
<P>
"No, seriously." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure." 
</P>
<P>
"And did you hear about the trouble in Detroit?" 
</P>
<P>
"Did it have anything to do with the Perez brothers?" I asked.

JIM MURRAY: NO-HITTERS USUALLY ARE FLASHES IN THE PAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thing about a no-hitter is, they're like streetcars. Right! If you miss 
one, there'll be another one along in a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball must feel like Custer when he said, "Did you ever see so many Indians 
in your life?" Baseball must wonder when the no-hitters are going to stop. 
</P>
<P>
Guys are pitching no-hitters the same day. They pitched five no-hitters in one 
month, June. They come in all sizes. Six-inning no-hitters. Losing-game 
no-hitters. We've had no-hitters pitched by brothers, consecutive no-hitters 
and no-hitters fashioned by as many as three pitchers in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing about no-hitters is that they're like holes-in-one in golf. You 
don't need any particular talent to get one. Cy Young won 511 games, but only 
two were no-hitters. Walter Johnson had it worse. He won 416 games, but only 
one was a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan has pitched six no-hitters, and that's altogether fitting. Sandy 
Koufax pitched four no-hitters, and no one will quarrel with that. Bob Feller 
had three. 
</P>
<P>
But no-hitters are not the stock-in-trade of the great and the near-great. 
No-hitters are pitched by nobodies, for the most part. 
</P>
<P>
I guess the typical no-hit pitcher was Bobo Holloman. Bobo Holloman pitched a 
no-hit game in his first major league start. It was the only complete game he 
was ever to pitch in the major leagues. He only won two other games. He started 
10 and lost eight. Bobo had good stuff. Unfortunately, he drank it. I was in 
the magazine dodge in those days, and we sent a colleague, Eddie Rees, to St. 
Louis to interview this phenom. He never got to. Bobo showed up drunk for 
breakfast. Bobo showed up drunk for lunch. And for good measure, for a postgame 
meeting at a hotel, Bobo showed up falling out of the elevator. He was out of 
baseball forever in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bobo was the biggest nobody to throw a no-hitter but not the only one. You 
would think the no-hit roster would read like a Who's-Who. It reads like a 
Who's-That? 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Vander Meer is the only major leaguer to pitch consecutive no-hitters. 
So, he's one of the elite of the game, right? Johnny's lifetime record: 
119-121. 
</P>
<P>
You look down the no-hit roster, and sandwiched between all the Ryans and 
Koufaxes and Fellers are such household names as Dick Bosman, Tom Phoebus, Ed 
Head, George Culver, Ed Halicki. 
</P>
<P>
You ever heard of Mike Warren? Well, Mike threw a no-hitter seven years ago for 
the Oakland A's against the Chicago White Sox. That shouldn't have been a 
surprise. It was Mike's fifth victory of the year and, since it came on Sept. 
29, his last. That was more games than Mike was to win the rest of his career 
as he drifted to 3-6 and 1-4 and out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Dizzy Dean never threw a no-hitter. But his brother Paul did. That right there 
is almost all you need to know about no-hitters as a fact of baseball life. 
Dizzy was 100 lifetime victories ahead of his brother and, at that, his own 
career was shortened by injury. Dizzy was miffed when his brother pitched a 
no-hitter in the second game of a doubleheader in which Diz pitched the first 
game. "I wish I'da known Paul was goin' to pitch a no-hitter. I'da pitched one, 
too," Diz sniffed. He had pitched a three-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Don Drysdale never pitched a no-hitter. But Bill Stoneman did. The only quibble 
with that is, Drysdale won 209 lifetime games, Stoneman 50. Big D's ERA was 
2.95, Stoneman's was 4.08. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Gaylord Perry, who won 314 games, 12th on the all-time list, pitched a 
no-hitter for the Giants. The next afternoon, in the same ballpark 
(Candlestick), Ray Washburn of the Cardinals, who was to have 72 lifetime 
victories, threw another no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The last (solo) no-hitter pitched in the American League before Randy Johnson's 
this season was by Juan Nieves of Milwaukee (against Baltimore) in 1987. Juan 
was pitching in the American Assn., at Denver, when last seen. 
</P>
<P>
The late, luckless Don Wilson was an in-and-out pitcher for Houston for nine 
years. He scratched out a lackluster 104-92 record. But he threw two 
no-hitters. He pitched one of them the day after Jim Maloney of the Reds had 
no-hit his team. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Haddix is widely held to be the most star-crossed of the no-hit 
pitchers. Harvey threw 12 innings of perfect baseball -- no baserunner reached 
first base on anything, walk, error, hit-by-pitch -- only to lose the game in 
the 13th to a guy, Lew Burdette, who was pitching a 12-hit shutout. 
</P>
<P>
But Maloney has a strong case. He pitched two no-hitters in 1965 and only won 
one of them. What's more, they both went extra innings. He lost one in the 11th 
inning, won the other in 10 innings. He had a third no-hitter in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
A great dust-up was raised this year when the Yankees' Andy Hawkins lost a 
no-hit game because of errors. But losing no-hit games are no novelty. Bobo 
Newsom won 211 games in his career. But he lost 222. And one of his losses was 
a 9 2/3-inning no-hitter, in which he had given up no hits but a run (to an 
error), when the Boston Red Sox beat him in the 10th with a ground ball that 
hopped off the shortstop's (appropriately named Strange) glove. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 212 no-hitters pitched in major league history, including some 
when the distance to home plate was only 50 feet. But the no-hitters belong to 
the nonentities. The Dave Moreheads (lifetime record 40-64), the Bill Dietrichs 
(108-128), the Jack Kralicks (67-65), Don Cardwells (102-138), Bob Keegans 
(40-36), Joe Cowleys (33-25). 
</P>
<P>
Melido Perez's was an absolutely perfect profile for a no-hit pitcher when he 
faced the Yankees Thursday night -- lifetime record 31-32, lifetime ERA 4.47. 
Not many people outside of Chicago had ever heard of him. Few knew Pascual 
Perez had a brother, much less one in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But does his six-inning no-hitter constitute a real no-hitter? Well, it's an 
official game. There have been about 34 no-hit games that went fewer than nine 
innings. Mike McCormick holds a no-hit game record for a five-inning complete 
game even though he gave up a single in the sixth (it was wiped out by rain, 
and the game reverted to the previous inning). 
</P>
<P>
No-hitters are as bewildering as the people who throw them. If Melido Perez's 
"no-hitter" counts, so should one thrown for seven innings by Walter Johnson in 
1924. 
</P>
<P>
It's a freak. But what about no-hitters isn't? If four innings of no-hit ball 
went into the record books, there would probably be 9,000 no-hit pitchers in 
the game. As of now, the Perez brothers have two "official" no-hit games 
between them -- even though their total innings would not equal one of Harvey 
Haddix's. Baseball, like life, isn't fair, and no-hit games are the unfairest 
of all. The Perezes each have a no-hit victory on their record with a total of 
11 innings. Harvey has a 12 2/3-inning loss. Someone should sue.

INCONSISTENT HIRING, TRAINING OF BASEBALL'S OFFICIAL SCORERS REVIVE CHARGES OF 
HOME-TEAM BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Cal Ripken Jr. of the Baltimore Orioles closes in on the major league record 
for consecutive errorless games by a shortstop, his performances are being 
watched closely by Bill Stetka, a former baseball reporter who already has had 
a significant impact on the streak. 
</P>
<P>
Serving as the official scorer in Baltimore, Stetka charged a leaping Ripken 
with an error for failing to bring down a relay throw from center fielder Mike 
Devereaux. That seemingly ended the streak at 67 games, five shy of Ed 
Brinkman's American League record. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Stetka gave the error to Devereaux, preserving Ripken's streak, 
which is at 83 games -- five shy of the major league record held by Kevin 
Elster of the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably change 10 to 12 calls a year," Stetka said. "Sometimes it's news 
and sometimes it isn't, but my only concern is to get it right, which is what I 
felt I did in the Ripken case. 
</P>
<P>
"People have called it a hometown decision, said I was trying to protect 
Ripken, that I was pressured into doing it, but that's the furthest thing from 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had been pressured, I'd have quit on the spot. We get paid $65 a game as 
official scorers, and I'm not the first to say that $1 of that is for making 
the calls, $1 for filling out the paper work and $63 is for the grief." 
</P>
<P>
Grief comes with the job, as it does for umpires. The best scorers, like the 
best umpires, go about it quietly, anonymously, but at some point they are 
certain to hear from a manager, coach, player, agent, club official, fan or 
member of the media. They are certain to be second-guessed. 
</P>
<P>
"Some years, no one knows we're alive, but we're not perfect, we're not God," 
said Bob Rosenberg, the official scorer at Chicago White Sox games. "I mean, no 
official scorer wants to be part of the story, but the nature of the job 
probably makes it inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg became part of the story recently when he made three pivotal calls 
that preserved the no-hitter pitched by Andy Hawkins of the New York Yankees in 
a 4-0 loss to the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring decisions are critical to statistics, salaries and the stuff of 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
Take away five hits from 500 at-bats, and a .300 batting average becomes .290. 
Add five earned runs in a span of 200 innings, and an earned-run average rises 
from 2.50 to 2.73. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics, it has been said, are the wheel on which baseball turns, but there 
are no defined criteria for picking the people who help establish those 
statistics through their scoring, and no system of schooling for them. 
</P>
<P>
The role, for a half-century or more, was filled by active baseball reporters 
who covered 100 or more games for three consecutive years. Then, papers began 
to view the pay and the arguments as conflicts of interest. Reporters now serve 
as official scorers in only six of the 26 major league ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
They have been replaced in recent years by a liquor store owner, a real estate 
broker, an Oriental rug dealer, a driver-training instructor, a retired fireman 
and a sandlot umpire, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Stetka, the former Baltimore reporter, is now the alumni director at Towson 
State University in Maryland. Rosenberg, the scorer at Comiskey Park, is a 
statistician and scorer for several teams in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Munson, scorer for Angel home games, runs an advertising agency and was once 
the club's publicity director. Wayne Monroe, who scores most of the games at 
Dodger Stadium, works for the Racing Form after previously reporting on sports 
at the San Gabriel Valley Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour Siwoff, head of the Elias News Bureau, which maintains baseball's 
statistics, said he laments the current system of hiring scorers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there were isolated incidents when the writers did it, but looking at 
the total picture, it was a terrific system because you had a built-in roster 
of people who had seen lots of games," Siwoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I think baseball has a problem it hasn't addressed. There's no training 
and no backlog of potential scorers. We've had cases this year where the scorer 
wasn't available and the club's public relations man did it. I mean, that's 
unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Some scoring aspects are defined by the rule book. Others are left to judgment. 
Players contend that there is no consistency, that home-team bias exists in 
some cities but not in others. 
</P>
<P>
"The consistency varies greatly from city to city," Ripken said at the All-Star 
game. "People say to me, 'What do you care, you're making all that money, it's 
none of your business.' Maybe that's true, but I do care. A hit here and there 
does matter. I try not to worry about things I can't control, but it's only 
human nature to get upset. This is my career, my profession." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stetka: "When Terry Crowley was the hitting coach here, he used to call 
all the time and say things like, 'Hey, we're the home team, we should get that 
call,' or, 'Why don't you give the kid a break, he's a rookie.' 
</P>
<P>
"Those things are at odds with the rule book and can't have anything to do with 
the way you score. I think most of the Orioles would tell you they don't 
consider me a friend and that I'm one of the toughest scorers in the league, 
but I actually get more complaints from people in rotisserie leagues than from 
the players." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, scoring can prove to be a risk. Johnny Temple, the former 
Cincinnati Reds second baseman, once punched reporter Earl Lawson for charging 
him with an error. When Bob Considine deprived the Washington Senators' Joey 
Kuhel of a hit, he stormed the press box and made yet another error by punching 
the wrong man, Shirley Povich of the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
"Players like to test you to see if they can intimidate you," said Charlie 
Scoggins, a veteran baseball reporter with the Lowell, Mass., Sun. He still 
acts as a scorer but says it isn't a conflict because it forces him to watch 
the game more closely and generates conversation with players who wouldn't talk 
to him otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
One decision by Scoggins resulted in a publicist from a visiting team screaming 
at him in the press box. Another prompted a Red Sox player to throw a can of 
beer at him. He has been telephoned by whining player agents, begging him to 
change decisions that were going to cost their clients money. He was called by 
Dave Stieb of the Toronto Blue Jays, who asked that a hit be changed to an 
error, so that he wouldn't lose the American League's earned-run average title. 
Stieb apparently went into the clubhouse and calculated his ERA before picking 
up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Any scoring adjustment must be made within 24 hours. After that, it requires 
intervention by the league. 
</P>
<P>
Most scorers acknowledge that replays have made it easier to get their call 
right the first time, but the pressure is greater because of the link between 
statistics and escalating salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The Ripken reversal was merely the latest in a series of famous reversals. 
</P>
<P>
In 1917, Ernie Koob of the St. Louis Browns pitched a no-hitter with the help 
of a generous scorekeeper who got caught in a streetcar tie-up and missed a 
first-inning hit he later ruled an error, based on the testimony of press box 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, Virgil Trucks of the Detroit Tigers was credited with a no-hitter 
after an early inning hit was changed to an error in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
A New York scorer, on the final day of the 1945 season, changed an error to a 
hit, permitting Snuffy Stirnweiss of the Yankees to edge the White Sox's Tony 
Cuccinello for the batting title. One year later, in Washington, the Senators' 
Mickey Vernon edged the Cleveland Indians' Al Rosen for the batting title 
because of a similar change. 
</P>
<P>
Former Oriole manager Earl Weaver, seeking to have a player credited with a 
single on a bunt that was clearly an error, called the press box and said: "I'm 
having trouble getting this guy to bunt. If you don't give him a hit on that, 
I'll never get him to bunt." 
</P>
<P>
There have been obscenities and obscene gestures directed at scorers. Chicago 
Cubs Manager Don Zimmer made an X-rated call to scorer Monroe at Dodger Stadium 
two weeks ago after Monroe did the unthinkable, justifiably charging Cub second 
baseman Ryne Sandberg with a throwing error. It was a no-win proposition for 
Monroe because Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia lost a run batted in on the call 
and also was upset. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda has called angrily. Steve Garvey, still in uniform, 
once made a personal visit to appeal a decision. Brian Downing of the Angels 
came charging into the press box at Anaheim Stadium to berate John Weyler of 
The Times after being erroneously told that a comment by Weyler influenced 
Munson to charge Downing with an error, ending his American League-record 
streak of errorless games by an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Said Monroe: "I've been doing this for 11 years and am not as easily 
intimidated as I once was. I'm not going to accept abuse, but if someone calls 
and talks decently, I'll listen, I'll take another look. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do what's right, and I don't want to be known as a homer. I mean, in 
some cases the players have a legitimate gripe. They go on the road and see 
hometown decisions and expect the same thing here. It makes my job that much 
tougher. I was watching a game from New York recently in which the calls were 
so embarrassing that I called the (National) League office to complain." 
</P>
<P>
Players who criticize scorers may be losing sight of the main issue -- which is 
winning and losing. That might be affected by an umpire's decision but not by 
the ruling of an official scorer. But there are cases when a scoring decision 
is a lifetime thing. 
</P>
<P>
Angel announcer Ken Brett recalls a 1976 game at Anaheim Stadium. It was late 
in his career, and Brett, pitching for the White Sox, was one out away from a 
no-hitter in a scoreless duel with the Angels when Jerry Remy hit a check-swing 
grounder toward third baseman Jorge Orta, a defensive liability. Orta got a 
late jump and the ball skipped under his glove. The late Don Merry, covering 
the game for the Long Beach Press-Telegram, called it a hit, the only hit in 
Brett's 10-inning, 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The win somewhat paled compared to the potential no-hitter," Brett said. "You 
come that close, you want it. It's a piece of immortality. Everyone remembers a 
no-hitter, and I felt that was a makeable play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset, and so were others. It's impossible to forget." 
</P>
<P>
The strange thing about the Brett game is that many scorers believe that the 
first hit in a potential no-hitter has to be absolutely clean, free of doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg, who scored Hawkins' no-hitter, said: "A hit is a hit. I mean, if I'm 
going to give an infield hit early in the game, I'm going to call it the same 
way late in the game. What's the difference?" 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg called three errors in the eighth inning of Hawkins' game, when the 
White Sox scored their four runs. 
</P>
<P>
The first, on a grounder that third baseman Mike Blowers mishandled, caused 
some confusion when the scoreboard flashed hit. 
</P>
<P>
"The Yankees were screaming at me from the dugout, and I hadn't even made the 
call yet," Rosenberg said. "There was a new scoreboard operator, and he put up 
hit, even though I was still watching the replay. I had no doubt about it. It 
was an error all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Stetka decided to review his initial decision on Ripken after an Oriole public 
relations official asked him to look at the play from different angles in a 
production truck. Those views, combined with subsequent conversations with the 
people involved, convinced Stetka he was wrong, though his pursuit of a right 
decision, he said, became comical. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to talk to people, and I've got all these writers and cameras 
following me from one side of the field to the other," he said. "I've been 
there, of course, as a reporter and PR man, but I wanted to say, 'Give me some 
room; I've got to make a decision.' " 
</P>
<P>
There are those who contend that scoring should be left to former umpires or 
players, with scorers working a geographical region rather than the same city, 
to do away with bias. Stetka said he puts up with the $63 worth of grief 
because he loves the game and wants to stay involved, but he agrees that the 
system isn't good; that when the clubs are allowed to select the scorers, "it 
leads to the risk of hometown unevenness." 
</P>
<P>
The answer? "I don't have one," said Stetka, who had the right one as far as 
Cal Ripken Jr. was concerned.

NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's Route: The Texas Rangers delayed Nolan Ryan's first start of the second 
half, representing a bid for his 298th career victory, until Saturday so that 
Ryan wouldn't have to face Baltimore during a three-game series starting 
Monday. The Orioles, through good years and bad, inexplicably own Ryan. He has 
a career record of 5-16 -- 1-11 since pitching a no-hitter -- against them, 
including an 0-9 record in his last 12 starts, and has not beaten them since 
April 20, 1980. Ryan (9-4) beat Detroit Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Robin's Egg: The Milwaukee Brewers' Robin Yount, the American League's most 
valuable player in 1989, opened the second half of the 1990 season with a .239 
batting average and a .217 average with runners in scoring position. Yount has 
not hit less than .277 since 1982 and never less than .250, his average as an 
18-year-old rookie in 1974. Yount is 34, and the Brewers are concerned that (a) 
he refuses to recognize he must finally make adjustments and (b) he refuses to 
work with hitting instructor Don Baylor because he doesn't subscribe to 
Baylor's use of videos. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's Law: If Yount is displaying stubbornness, the Atlanta Braves may be 
doing the same in regard to veteran Dale Murphy. The statistics indicate that 
it may be time for Murphy to start platooning. He opened the second half with a 
.319 average, nine home runs and 25 runs batted in against left-handers but 
only a .180 average, four home runs and 18 runs batted in against 
right-handers. The bigger issue: Should the Braves re-sign Murphy, still a 
Georgia favorite, or allow him to leave as a free agent when the season ends? 
</P>
<P>
Junior's View: Ken Griffey Jr., the Seattle Mariners' All-Star, wasn't that 
impressed with his first visit to Wrigley Field. Griffey said he preferred the 
Kingdome. "No wind, no rain, no hassles," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Reds' Shuffle: Rookie Chris Hammond, who was 10-1 at Nashville, will start for 
Cincinnati against the New York Mets today with a shot at becoming the Reds' 
fifth starter. In another rotation move, the Reds have sent Scott Scudder, a 
disappointment as the initial replacement for injured Jose Rijo, to the bullpen 
and will give Norm Charlton a crack at that spot. Will fellow relievers Randy 
Myers and Rob Dibble expel Charlton as a Nasty Boy? "When I see my picture 
crossed out on the T-shirts, I'll know it's over," Charlton said. ROSS NEWHAN

ALL BIG GAMES WON'T BE BETWEEN THE LINES

<TEXT>
<P>
The games of the second half have begun, with some of the biggest to be decided 
off the field: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Commissioner Fay Vincent is expected to reach a decision by early August on 
George Steinbrenner's status as owner of the New York Yankees, with Monday the 
deadline for Steinbrenner to present additional testimony or evidence regarding 
his relationship with alleged gambler Howie Spira, and Steinbrenner's handling 
of Dave Winfield while Winfield was a Yankee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Thursday, a federal judge in Cincinnati will announce Pete Rose's 
sentence for filing false tax returns. A prison sentence of three to six months 
is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arbitrator George Nicolau is expected to announce all or part of the 
financial penalties in Collusion II and III before the end of the season. The 
Major League Baseball Players Assn. has recommended damages of $200 million for 
the three cases. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The National League is receiving and responding to expansion 
questionnaires. Prospective owners are scheduled to be interviewed before Sept. 
30, with the expansion committee formulating an initial finding by Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Among those with a personal interest in the expansion process is Dodger 
broadcaster Don Drysdale, who has agreed to become vice president and general 
manager of a Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., team if a group fronted by Ken 
Harrelson wins that franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done just about everything else in baseball, and I don't care about 
managing," Drysdale said. "This is the next plateau. I'm looking at the 
challenge. I think it would be fun." 
</P>
<P>
Harrelson and Drysdale became close while serving as Chicago White Sox 
broadcasters. Harrelson then made a failed run as White Sox general manager, 
employing Drysdale as a pitching coach before resigning under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Now Harrelson, known as Hawk because of the shape of his nose, is back 
broadcasting White Sox games. He said of the expansion bid: "I'll be a 
part-owner, but Don will run the baseball operation. I've been there once and 
had my nose knocked off. Now it's his turn." 
</P>
<P>
Sarasota, Fla., businessman Tom Hammons is known to be one of Harrelson's 
financial backers, but Harrelson said the others won't be identified until 
after the league completes interviews. Drysdale said the money is there or he 
wouldn't be involved. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three groups bidding for a Tampa-St. Petersburg franchise, the 
late-emerging Harrelson group is given the least chance by Florida observers. 
</P>
<P>
The sentimental favorite is a group headed by area businessman Frank Morsani, 
who has been at the forefront of the area's expansion bid for almost a decade 
and pushed for construction of the Suncoast Dome. 
</P>
<P>
The third group is fronted by Joel Schur and Steven Porter, co-owners of the 
St. Petersburg Cardinals of the Florida State League. This group is said to 
have resources of $2 billion and incorporates investors from rival Orlando, 
Fla., including Los Angeles-based Roy Disney, Walt's nephew. 
</P>
<P>
How to measure the depths of the Angels' underachievement this season? Try 
comparative salaries, a popular yardstick among players. 
</P>
<P>
Adding the salaries of the five starting pitchers and nine players who have 
most often made up the starting lineup, the Chicago White Sox have a total of 
$6.7 million and an average of $478,785 a player, and the Seattle Mariners have 
a total of $6.6 million and an average of $474,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels do not have a regular lineup, but using Brian Downing as the 
designated hitter, Chili Davis as the left fielder, Devon White as the most 
frequent center fielder of the first half, Winfield as the right fielder and 
the rest of their regular position players and starting pitchers, the total is 
$16,785,000. 
</P>
<P>
That's $10 million more than the White Sox and Mariners and an average of 
$1,198,928 per player, about $700,000 more than the averages for Chicago and 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that the Angels are trailing -- and showing no interest in 
catching -- two teams with payrolls that seem stingy in contrast with their 
own, two teams more motivated because of it, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Autry's long admiration for, and warm relationship with, Whitey Herzog was 
chronicled in this column last Sunday, Autry saying he would probably contact 
Herzog after giving him time to sort out his emotions after his resignation as 
manager of the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
It now turns out that Autry and Herzog had lunch in Los Angeles a few days 
before Herzog resigned, and while there have been rumors about Herzog 
eventually joining the Yankees or an expansion team as manager or general 
manager, the Angels should not be ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the impressive return of Cecil Fielder from Japan with the 
Detroit Tigers, the Montreal Expos, one of baseball's most successful scouting 
and developmental organizations, have decided to place a full-time scout in 
that country. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that if we get one guy, it will be worth it," General Manager Dave 
Dombrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
In their last 19 games of the first half, the Tigers' starting pitchers yielded 
65 earned runs in 93 innings, pushing their earned-run average for the first 
half to 5.13. 
</P>
<P>
The point: Kirk Gibson's desire to return to Detroit and the Dodgers' desire to 
obtain a fifth starting pitcher don't seem to mix. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Dodgers have rejected Detroit's offer of Brian DuBois, and the 
Tigers have rejected the Dodgers' bid for Steve Searcy. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Boston Red Sox, looking for another starting pitcher down 
the stretch, are also said to be talking with the Tigers regarding Jack Morris, 
who won his last two starts of the first half and pitched complete games in two 
of his last three before being bombed by the Texas Rangers in Thursday's first 
start of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Gorman, Red Sox general manager, is also reportedly interested in Mike 
Scott of the Houston Astros and has traditionally traded for extra pitching 
when his team is in the race. Gorman swapped Steve Lyons for Tom Seaver in June 
of 1986 and dealt Brady Anderson and Curt Schilling for Mike Boddicker in July 
of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a wrist injury that reduced his effectiveness in April and a hamstring 
strain that recently put him on the bench for a week, Kevin Mitchell is having 
another fine season with 22 home runs, 51 runs batted in and a .317 average. 
</P>
<P>
Can he still match the 47 homers and 125 RBIs of his 1989 MVP campaign? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't set any goals," the San Francisco Giant left fielder said at the 
All-Star game. "I just want to go out and do the best I can. I've still never 
felt like I did last year at the plate. I haven't had that feeling that I can 
hit one out against any pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Derek Lilliquist, sixth player chosen in 1987's June draft, had a 2-8 record 
and a 6.28 ERA with the Atlanta Braves when he was sent to their triple-A farm 
club at Richmond, Va., in early June. 
</P>
<P>
Lilliquist responded with a 4-0 record in five starts, rebuilding his stock to 
the point that Jack McKeon, only one day after giving up the San Diego Padres' 
managerial reins to concentrate on his responsibilities as general manager, 
began what is expected to be a second-half housecleaning by trading Mark Grant 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
The deal failed to produce major headlines but could prove significant for the 
Padres. Lilliquist is a 24-year-old left-hander who still has a chance to 
fulfill his promise and may profit from the change in venue, though he will be 
used initially in middle relief. 
</P>
<P>
And Grant was no longer in San Diego's plans. He had a 1-1 record and no saves 
in 26 appearances, pitching in only three Padre victories. 
</P>
<P>
In parting with Lilliquist, Atlanta Manager-General Manager Bobby Cox said: 
"We've got left-handed starters backed up throughout the organization. Sooner 
or later, we were going to have to do something to help the bullpen. We've got 
good reports on Grant, and we plan on using him in both the setup and closer 
roles." 
</P>
<P>
The Braves, through Thursday, ranked well down in the National League with 18 
saves and had wasted almost as many opportunities, 16.

WI HAS CHANCE FOR RARE AMATEUR DOUBLE

<P>
Charlie Wi, a South Korean-born 18-year-old golfer from Thousand Oaks, will 
attempt to accomplish this week something that has not been done in 48 years -- 
win the Southern California Amateur championship and the California State 
Amateur in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Dawson, a Walker Cup veteran who won four Southern California Amateur 
titles, did it in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
Wi, a graduate of Westlake High School who plans to enroll at Nevada Reno in 
the fall, won the State title last month when he defeated former champion Gary 
Vanier of Oakland, 3 and 2, in the 36-hole final at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of 21 players exempt from qualifying for the 91st Southern California 
Golf Assn. event, which will be played Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the 
Wilshire Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Also exempt is defending champion Paul Stankowski, 20, a senior at Texas El 
Paso, who won the tournament last year at Glendora Country Club. Stankowski, 
who lives in Oxnard and plays out of the CBC Port Hueneme Country Club, is also 
the Western Athletic Conference champion and lost a playoff against Mark 
Johnson of Barstow for medalist honors in the California State Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
Exempt players include those who either finished in the top five in last year's 
Southern California Amateur or Mid-Amateur, reached match play in the recent 
State Amateur, or won the SCGA Senior Amateur, the Tournament of Club Champions 
or the CIF-SCGA championship. 
</P>
<P>
Among those are 1988 Southern California Amateur champion Craig Steinberg of 
Van Nuys and Braemar Country Club, Mid-Amateur champion Johnson of Sun 'N Sky 
Golf Club and Austin Maki of Costa Mesa, the state high school champion from 
Estancia. Maki also won the Long Beach City championship last week. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Davis, the 1975 Southern California champion from Los Angeles Country Club, 
also was exempt but withdrew because of back injuries. Davis won the event the 
last time it was held at Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the 65 in the 86-player field will be determined by qualifying 
rounds Monday at Industry Hills, Quail Ranch, San Clemente, Meadow Lake, 
Hesperia and Rancho Maria. A total of 358 golfers will attempt to qualify for 
the championship flight. 
</P>
<P>
Three former champions -- Brian Gaddy (1976), Dave Sheff (1986) and Bud Ardell 
(1980) -- will be among those making the try, Gaddy and Sheff at Industry Hills 
and Ardell at Hesperia. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the fourth time the championship has been played over the 
70-year-old Wilshire course, a 6,531-yard, par-72 layout that is laced by a 
distinctive creek that can come into play on as many as 16 of the 18 holes. Pro 
Rick Rielly, club President Joe Shehab and superintendent Alex Galaviz have the 
course in ideal condition for the tournament -- the oldest continuously 
contested amateur championship in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire is the host club because Serge Baliff is president of the SCGA, and 
the championship tournament is traditionally played at the home course of the 
president. Baliff has been a member at Wilshire since 1947 and estimates he has 
played 6,000 rounds at the club. He has made a hole in one on each of the 
par-three holes and has a lifetime eclectic score of 45 -- nine birdies and 
nine eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Baliff is also the only player to have participated in all 40 MacBeth 
Invitationals, the premier event of the Wilshire season. In 1978, at 57, he won 
it with Bill Randall as his partner. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the championship flight, another 756 players will tee off Monday 
to qualify for three handicap flights. All final rounds will be played next 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Twelve former winners in the Optimist Junior World championships have entered 
the 23rd renewal of the event, which will start Tuesday on five San Diego-area 
courses. Eldrick (Tiger) Woods of Cypress, already a four-time winner, will try 
for a record fifth in the boys' 13-14 class, which he won last year. Woods also 
won the 11-12 division in 1988 and the 10-and-under division in 1984 and '85. 
Only one other player, Sharon Barrett of Spring Valley, has ever won four. Hers 
came between 1972 and '79. An entry list of 750, including 150 from foreign 
countries, will compete, according to tournament director Norrie West. Play 
will be at Torrey Pines for the 15-17 age group, Mission Trails for the 13-14, 
Singing Hills' Pine Glen for the 11-12 and Presidio Hills for the 10-and-under. 
</P>
<P>
John Mason of El Cajon, a regular on the Golden State Tour, will defend his 
championship July 26-29 in the $110,000 Long Beach Open. The winner of the 
72-hole tournament at Recreation Park and El Dorado will receive $20,000. A 
field of 280 pros and 30 amateurs will alternate courses on the first two days, 
with survivors of the 36-hole cut completing the tournament at El Dorado. Matt 
Pegan of Long Beach is the defending amateur champion. Among the favored pro 
entries are Brad Bell and Kevin Leach from the Hogan tour, Howie Johnson and 
Brad Gallagher from the Canadian tour, plus the 1988 United States Amateur 
champion, Eric Meeks, and his twin brother, Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
Tom McHugh, for many years director of National Golf Courses, Inc., when its 
flagship course was Pomona National -- now Los Angeles Royal Vista -- will 
return to that position this week with headquarters in Vancouver, Wash. NGC 
operates three courses near the Oregon-Washington border, plus Ontario National 
in Southern California. L. A. Royal Vista is no longer part of the National 
group. . . . Southern California PGA apprentice professionals will play for 
their championship on July 23 at Singing Hills CC in El Cajon. . . . The second 
of five Oldsmobile Scrambles qualifiers in Southern California will be played 
Monday at Spring Valley Lake CC in Victorville. Next month, play will be held 
at North Ranch CC in Westlake Village, Coto de Caza and Singing Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Hale Irwin, when asked by a Golf Digest writer in June 1985 for his opinion of 
special exemptions into the U.S. Open, said, "When the USGA invites, say, 
(Arnold) Palmer to play, it opens a Pandora's box. How about Miller Barber or 
Don January, about the same age as Arnold, who are playing as well today as he 
is? Honoring the old champions by letting them play is a trip down nostalgia 
lane. If, in 1999, I were given a special exemption, I would respectfully 
decline." As all know, Irwin received and accepted an exemption into the recent 
U. S. Open -- and won. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer will make his 33rd consecutive appearance in the PGA Championship Aug. 
9-12 at Shoal Creek CC in Birmingham, Ala. It is the only major championship he 
has not won, but he has three second-place finishes. In 1984, Palmer received a 
lifetime invitation from the PGA board of directors to play in the event. . . . 
The United States Golf Assn. will return to its roots for championships in its 
centennial year of 1995 when it holds the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills, in 
Southampton, N.Y., and the U.S. Amateur at the Newport Country Club in Newport, 
R.I. Shinnecock and Newport were among the five clubs that organized the USGA 
in the winter of 1894. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment and sports celebrities will participate Monday in the American 
Diabetes Assn.'s third annual Defeat Diabetes Invitational at Riviera CC. Spots 
are available for $300 a person and $1,400 for a foursome. Proceeds will be 
used for diabetes research. . . . The American Lung Assn. is offering a playing 
privilege card for $60 that will enable players to secure 42 free rounds on 30 
courses in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, including Desert Dunes, 
Indian Hills, La Quinta Hotel, Mission Lakes, Rancho California and Moreno 
Valley Ranch. Card information is available at (714) 884-5864.

TURNER SLIDES BUT HOLDS LEAD AS FIELD FARES WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mike Turner leads the 73rd annual Los Angeles City Golf Championship entering 
today's final round, and he may have his competition to thank for it. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, 33, a pillow manufacturer from Van Nuys, led by one stroke entering 
Saturday's third round at Rancho Park, but struggled reaching the greens and 
putted poorly on the back nine to finish one over par for the day, two under 
for the tournament at 68-71-72 -- 211. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Turner, the rest of the field struggled so much that he 
increased his lead to three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Cruz, who was second after 36 holes, shot three-over to finish 68-72-74 -- 
214. Ed Susolik, 69-74-74 -- 217, and Jim Lundstrom, 75-70-72 -- 217, are tied 
for third. 
</P>
<P>
"The greens were a little bumpy and it didn't seem like I was hitting my 
approach shots well," said Turner, who won the tournament in 1987. "But this is 
a tough course and I figure if you shoot a 74, you don't lose any ground." 
</P>
<P>
Slow greens and 105-degree heat were common complaints. But the conditions 
didn't play favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing here is to keep it in the middle of the fairway," Turner said. 
"I kept it in play and hit it straight today. If my approaches were a little 
better, I could have scored much lower." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he bogeyed the 15th hole, a 431-yard, par-four after hitting long 
off the tee, then short on his approach, three-putting from 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty of the course, the winds and the heat left most of the golfers 
optimistic about their chances in today's final round. 
</P>
<P>
Susolik, 27, a recent USC law school graduate, said he thinks his chances are 
good for winning the title today. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my birdie putts kept slipping out today and the greens were a little 
slower than I expected," he said. "But I'll compensate for that tomorrow and I 
like my chances."

SHEEHAN SPLASHES TO RECORD

Patty Sheehan shattered the U.S. Women's Open record for 36 holes Saturday when 
she completed a two-day round of four-under-par 68 to take a six-shot lead in 
the rain-plagued event. 
</P>
<P>
The leading money winner on the LPGA Tour this year faces a 36-hole test today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with my position," Sheehan said after her 10-under-par 134 
score for two trips around the 6,298-yard Riverside Course at the Atlanta 
Athletic Club in Duluth, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
USGA officials said it was believed to be the first time a player ever was 
10-under in the Women's Open. She broke the 36-hole scoring record of 138 set 
last year by Betsy King. 
</P>
<P>
An overnight rain kept players off the course until Saturday afternoon and 
limited play to those players finishing their second rounds. Sheehan played 15 
holes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
She held the lead over Jane Geddes, the 1986 Open champion who needed 12 hours 
and endured two rain delays before completing a 74 on Friday that left her at 
140. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Verplank is enjoying playing "catch me" instead of catch up, in the Bank 
of Boston Classic PGA tournament at Sutton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"At least I don't have to pass anyone tomorrow," Verplank said after he 
retained a one-stroke lead with a three-under-par 68 for a 54-hole score of 
203, 10 strokes under regulation, at Pleasant Valley Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid for his first tour victory since the 1988 Buick Open, Verplank had a 
one-stroke lead over Brian Tennyson, who finished a bogey-free third round with 
birdies on the last two holes. 
</P>
<P>
At 206, three strokes back, were Mike Smith, Sam Randolph, Willie Wood and 
Clarence Rose. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 players have a shot at the $90,000 winner's check in the Kroger 
Senior Classic at Mason, Ohio, co-leader Lee Trevino said after play was rained 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to go all the way to the two-unders -- at least a dozen guys," 
Trevino said. "It would be difficult to come from even par." 
</P>
<P>
After Trevino and Dave Hill, who are tied at six-under-par 65, there are 21 
other players who were at least two under par after Friday's round. 
</P>
<P>
The $600,000 tournament was also halted by rain on Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
One stroke behind the leaders were Joe Jimenez, a 64-year-old lifetime club 
pro; Walt Zembriski, a retired ironworker; and John Paul Cain, a stockbroker 
from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Welshman Ian Woosnam won back-to-back golf tournaments for the first time when 
he shot a final-round 68 to win the $680,000 Scottish Open at Gleneagles. 
</P>
<P>
Woosnam moved away from the field to a 19-under 269 for a four-stroke victory 
over Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe.

Stefan Edberg left England with his second Wimbledon singles title. Six days 
later, he will leave Japan with a bruised left knee. 
</P>
<P>
The Swede, who defeated Boris Becker last Sunday in the Wimbledon final, 
retired from the Gunze World tournament Saturday after being injured when he 
tripped over his racket. 
</P>
<P>
While trying to return a shot of Jaime Yzaga of Peru, Edberg slipped and his 
racket fell to the court. His foot apparently hit the racket and he fell to the 
artificial surface. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember exactly what happened," Edberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Atsushi Iwamoto, who treated Edberg, said, "It was a bruise and not so 
serious. I think he will be able to start practicing within two or three days." 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred during the first game of the second set after Edberg won 
the first set, 6-2, at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, Pete Sampras beat Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland, 6-2, 
4-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's semifinals, top-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina defeated 
Kimiko Date of Japan, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2, and Ann Grossman beat Rachel McQuillan of 
Australia, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6). 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen-year-old Jennifer Capriati moved to the brink of her first pro title, 
defeating Susan Sloane, 6-2, 6-2, in the semifinals of the Mount Cranmore 
International at Conway, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati will make her third appearance in a final when she meets third-seeded 
Ros Fairbank of Australia today. Fairbank upset No. 2 Laura Gildemeister, 7-6 
(12-10), 6-2, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Darren Cahill of Australia beat No. 7 Eric Jelen of West Germany, 
7-6 (7-4), 6-3, to reach the final of the Hall of Fame Championships at 
Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Cahill will face unseeded Pieter Aldrich of South Africa, who beat No. 4 Gary 
Muller, 6-4, 7-6 (9-7).

YOUNG MATER DEI SQUAD TRIUMPHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1989-90 state champion Mater Dei High School basketball team of 1989-90 is 
all but gone. Nine of its players graduated. 
</P>
<P>
But the new Monarchs may be developing the maturity to someday reign again. 
After losing twice to Capistrano Valley in earlier summer tournaments, Mater 
Dei edged the Cougars, 54-52, in the final match of the Mater Dei Nike 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very young and we're improving every time out," coach Gary McKnight 
said. "We're playing a little smarter now." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight pointed to forwards Reggie Geary and J.J. Ballesteros as possible 
emerging leaders for the 1990-91 Mater Dei team. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros, a senior, led the Monarchs' less-than-awesome offensive output 
with 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Geary, a junior, scored 10 points and was instrumental in a defense that held 
Capistrano Valley to two points through most of the first quarter. He also 
provided the winning margin with a pair of free throws in the final minute of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't trying to concentrate on shooting," Geary said. "I was trying to 
concentrate on defense, passing, the little things." 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros was also less concerned about offense. "We had to concentrate on 
blocking shots because they're a lot taller than us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's concentration on defense may have waivered, however. After the 
Monarchs nearly shut down the Cougar offense during the most of the first 
quarter, Capistrano Valley managed to come back within a point of Mater Dei and 
went into the second quarter trailing, 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
But despite that brief defensive lapse and an offensive effort with which he 
was less than satisfied, McKnight said he was happy with his team's improvement 
in "just their understanding of the game." 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Consolation championship: Artesia 88, Fullerton 74; Third place: Santa Clara 
67, Los Alamitos 52; Seventh place: Ocean View 81, Foothill 68; Semifinals: 
Mater Dei 77, Los Alamitos 63; Capistrano Valley 57, Santa Clara 54; 
Consolation semifinals: Fullerton 67, Foothill 66; Artesia 78, Ocean View 65. 
</P>
<P>
In the Servite tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Pat Thacker scored 31 points, including 11 in the fourth quarter, to lead Long 
Beach Millikan past Marina, 75-71, in a quarterfinal game. Marina's Cherokee 
Parks scored 22 points. In another quarterfinal game, Dominguez defeated Los 
Alamitos, 51-44, eliminating the final Orange County team from the championship 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Semifinals: Millikan 71, Long Beach Poly 67; Dominguez 62, Pomona 56; 
Consolation quarterfinals: Servite 99, Rolling Hills 72; Huntington Beach 63, 
San Pasqual 51. Consolation semifinals: Lakewood 79, Servite 75; Western 71, 
Huntington Beach 64.

DUKES HAVE TO WORK OVERTIME TO BEAT BREAKERS, 27-22

<P>
Greg Patton said it would be like this. But, really, you can't believe 
everything the Newport Beach Dukes coach says. 
</P>
<P>
Patton, who knows a thing or 500 about hyperbole, has been saying the Dukes are 
a good team, one of the best in Team Tennis. 
</P>
<P>
With a 27-22 overtime victory over the Miami Beach Breakers Saturday at the 
John Wayne Tennis Club, the Dukes proved his point. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes weren't great, merely good enough to survive for the first victory in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes' Marty Davis and Roger Smith lost the final set of the evening to 
Richard Schmidt and Greg Van Emburgh, 6-5. But since Team Tennis rules say you 
can't win by losing the final set, the doubles teams headed to overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The rules stipulate that the teams must continue play until the Dukes won one 
game, which was the case, or Miami Beach won enough games to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes broke Schmidt's serve for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, the Dukes followed their opening-night form. After going to two 
tiebreakers Thursday against Raleigh and losing both, the Dukes' women's 
doubles team of Sophie Amiach and Amy Frazier took Sandy Collins and Cammy 
MacGregor to a tiebreaker in the opening set. 
</P>
<P>
But this time Amiach's perfectly placed drop shot at 4-all gave the Dukes the 
set and an early lead. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier stayed on the baseline to defeat MacGregor, 6-2, in the women's singles 
set and the Dukes led, 12-7. Then Davis and Amiach won the mixed doubles over 
Schmidt and Collins, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Smith lost to Van Emburgh, but won three important games. Smith fell behind, 
4-0, but regrouped before losing, 6-3, and the Dukes still led, 21-16. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes play five consecutive road games starting tonight at San Antonio.

WASHINGTON; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSE EXPECTED TO VOTE SOON ON PROPOSAL TO CURB 'JUNK FAXES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, CATHERINE COLLINS is a Washington writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Junk mail has spawned what could be called Son of Junk Mail or Junk Mail II. 
It's the junk fax. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is so severe in some quarters that the powerful House Energy and 
Commerce Committee has passed legislation to restrict the use of telephone 
facsimile machines as well as their audio counterparts, automatic dialing 
recorded message players. 
</P>
<P>
The Telephone Advertising Regulation Act (H.R. 2921) is expected to come up for 
a vote on the House floor any day now. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill is intended to protect the legitimate privacy rights of consumers and 
to protect the public safety," said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who worked 
with the Federal Communications Commission and direct-marketing industry to 
draft the bill. "The legislation is not designed to impose unreasonable burdens 
on telemarketers or to ban the appropriate use of these new technologies." 
</P>
<P>
By next year, the number of fax machines in offices, homes and other places is 
expected to reach 5 million, according to the American Facsimile Assn. 
Lawmakers are concerned that many machines will be swamped by mass marketers 
selling everything from submarine sandwiches to fax paper. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would authorize the FCC to establish a national clearinghouse that 
would keep lists of telephone subscribers who do not want to receive the 
electronic equivalent of junk mail. The service would be provided at no cost to 
consumers. Advertisers would have to pay to obtain the list. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC would set penalties for advertisers who failed to abide by the list. 
The bill would also require the agency to set technical and procedural 
standards for fax and automatic dialing systems. 
</P>
<P>
Markey, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on 
telecommunications, wrote the bill, along with the ranking minority member, 
Rep. Matthew Rinaldo (D-N.J.). It combines two bills proposed by Reps. Barney 
Frank (D-Mass.) and Marge Roukema (R-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
The Markey-Rinaldo version is "a reasoned approach" to the issue, said Mag 
Gottlieb, director of government affairs for the Direct Marketing Assn. 
"However, we are concerned any time Congress attempts to limit First Amendment 
commercial speech." 
</P>
<P>
The bill is not expected to meet serious opposition in the House. So far, there 
is no companion legislation in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Right to Strike' Battle Promises to Be Bitter 
</P>
<P>
People in Congress worried that unions are losing one of their most effective 
tools -- the right to strike -- have proposed legislation to retain it. The 
effort may ignite a labor-business donnybrook. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William L. Clay (D-Mo.) has signed up 114 co-sponsors for his bill to 
prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacement workers during a strike. 
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) introduced companion legislation in the 
Senate and has 10 co-sponsors. The bills are highly controversial and staffers 
in both bodies say it is unlikely either will come up for a floor vote soon. 
</P>
<P>
"There is currently no effective right to strike in this country," Clay said at 
a hearing of the House labor-management subcommittee. "American workers find 
that, all too frequently, the result of exercising the fundamental right to 
strike is to lose their job. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a strike was thought to be a means by which employees could seek to 
maintain or improve their wages and working conditions. Today, the strike is 
used by employers to get rid of a union. The method is simple. An employer 
demands that workers accept unreasonable contract concessions -- in effect, 
daring the workers to strike. The employer then sits back to see if the 
employees bite. This makes a mockery of collective bargaining." 
</P>
<P>
Clay traces the problem to former President Ronald Reagan's firing of air 
traffic controllers and hiring of permanent replacements in 1981. He says it 
was a "green light" for private employers to use similar tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, business and industry are in a fury over the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Lunnie, director of employee relations at the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers, said strikes and the right to hire permanent replacements work 
as countervailing forces, and tinkering with the balance could damage the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Krebs, manager of business and government policy at the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, echoed Lunnie. "The right to strike is not unconditional," he said. 
"It must be balanced with an employer's right to stay in business." 
</P>
<P>
Organized labor is just as determined to back the measure, which Alan Reuther, 
assistant general counsel at the United Auto Workers, called "not just a labor 
issue, but a civil rights issue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Securities-Abuse Bills Clear House Panel 
</P>
<P>
Markey and Rinaldo teamed up again on one of two pieces of legislation giving 
the Securities and Exchange Commission broader power to curb penny stock fraud 
and other illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Penny Stock Bill (H.R. 4497) and the Securities Law Enforcement 
Remedies Act (H.R. 975) recently passed the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee. They could arrive on the floor for votes before Congress' summer 
recess. Similar bills are making their way through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Penny stocks are speculative securities that usually sell for $5 or less on the 
over-the-counter market. They are often used to finance small, new companies, 
but have frequently been employed in all manner of investor scams. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the SEC has the authority to seek significant fines and other civil 
penalties only for insider trading violations. It can only warn other violators 
or, as a last resort, revoke their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Markey and Rinaldo, joined by Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), introduced the penny 
stock bill to expand the SEC's authority. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would encourage regulators to develop an automated stock quotation 
system to help investors track penny stock prices. It also would strengthen 
disclosure procedures and set limits on how much money could be raised for 
unspecified investments -- so-called blind pool offerings. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC, the Consumer Federation of America and the North American Securities 
Administrators Assn. support the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The other piece of the package is a bill introduced by Rep. John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, that would expand the 
SEC's authority to levy civil penalties in securities fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the SEC could ask judges to impose fines in other fraud cases 
besides just insider trading. It also could ask judges to bar violators from 
serving as officers and directors of publicly traded companies.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: FED MAY BE POISED TO EASE, BUT FOR THE WRONG REASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRWIN L. KELLNER, IRWIN L. KELLNER is chief economist at Manufacturers 
Hanover in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a quarter of a century ago, when it was becoming increasingly obvious 
that the United States was slowly sinking into the quagmire of Vietnam, Sen. 
George Aiken (R-Vt.) came up with an interesting idea that, if used at the 
time, might have saved many lives -- not to mention millions of dollars. In a 
speech on the Senate floor in October, 1966, he said we should declare that we 
won the war and go home. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a situation exists that calls for a similar recommendation. After years 
of Federal Reserve battling against inflation, it appears that the economy is 
in danger of sinking into recession. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the only inflation left is in services, because prices of most 
consumer goods are actually falling, Aiken's suggestion seems to be applicable 
to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed: Declare victory 
over inflation, ease up on money and credit and let interest rates decline. 
</P>
<P>
True, Greenspan acknowledged Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee that 
the Fed is poised to ease interest rates. But he said such a move -- if it 
comes -- would be in response to signs of a credit crunch among banks. 
Greenspan said he didn't see any weakness in the economy that alone would 
justify easing rates. 
</P>
<P>
Such a view flies in the face of considerable evidence. 
</P>
<P>
An easier money policy would seem to be especially needed now, because it 
appears that there will be a tightening in fiscal policy related to a budgetary 
accommodation. The accommodation is more likely in view of President Bush's 
willingness to accept a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Fiscal policy aside, it is clear that the Fed has won the war against the 
portion of inflation it is capable of beating -- prices of goods -- and that it 
has done so at the expense of knocking the goods sector flat on its back. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of goods that we consumers pay fell in April, compared to March, after 
the usual seasonal adjustments. And it fell again in May, compared to April. 
That means in the last three months, consumer-goods inflation has been stopped 
dead in its tracks. 
</P>
<P>
If you want more evidence, look at the producer price index. Prices of raw 
materials, excluding food and energy, are actually down over the past 12 
months; they've been falling year-over-year since fall, 1989. And prices of 
intermediate goods, the next stage of production, have been flat, 
year-over-year, since the beginning of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
It's not difficult to see why. Goods sales are falling. Retail sales declined 
three months in a row, before rising slightly in June, the first time that has 
happened since the last recession. Personal spending on goods very likely fell 
in the second quarter, compared to a year ago. Only twice in the past 45 years 
has such a drop not led to a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, goods payrolls are down, with the decline in the past three 
months one of the biggest for any three-month period since the last recession. 
And while fewer people are engaged in production of goods than 10 years ago, at 
the start of the 1980s, most of the recent downtrend reflects a slowdown in 
output as goods producers seek to avoid a costly buildup of unwanted 
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is gasping for air. Home building is at its lowest rate since the 
recession -- and a full 25% below the pace recorded 30 years ago. Meanwhile, 
business spending on structures is no higher today than 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Even export growth, the bright spot in the economy, is beginning to dim. After 
logging year-over-year gains of as much as 30% in early 1988, export growth has 
throttled back to less than 5%. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, service prices continue to rise at an annual rate of 5% -- 
the pace they've been clocked at since the beginning of the current expansion 
nearly eight years ago. Looking at the reasons why provides additional 
ammunition for those who feel that easier money is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, services are labor-intensive. With unit labor costs climbing at 
least 5% a year in this sector, it's hard for service industries to avoid 
raising prices. 
</P>
<P>
The hikes tend to stick because, unlike many goods, services tend to be 
necessities. Consumers have little or no choice when it comes to paying the 
tab. 
</P>
<P>
Two good examples are the cost of medical care and education. For nearly 30 
years, medical services have been rising twice as fast as the consumer price 
index. In the past dozen years, the cost of education has ratcheted up 50% 
faster than the CPI. 
</P>
<P>
It seems obvious that for doctors and hospitals to stop raising fees and for 
colleges to stop increasing tuition, the Fed would have to become so tight that 
the weakness in the goods sector would spread -- and the entire economy would 
sink into recession. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the Fed isn't tight already. Bank reserves, the raw material that 
banks use to make loans and investments, have risen only 2% the past three 
years. This is the slowest 36-month rise since the three years ended February, 
1958 (when the economy was in a recession), and compares to an average 36-month 
rise of nearly 15% the past 43 years. 
</P>
<P>
The broadest measure of the money supply, M3, is growing at its slowest 
12-month pace in 20 years. For their part, real interest rates (rates adjusted 
for inflation) remain well above what consumers and businesses can pay with 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate profits are tumbling because most businesses can't raise prices 
enough to cover rising costs in a weak economy. As a consequence, profit 
margins are the lowest they've been since the last recession. And with dividend 
payouts historically high relative to after-tax earnings, most firms have 
little cash left to service their gigantic debt loads. 
</P>
<P>
Since price-earnings ratios are already a third above average and interest 
rates are high enough to be drawing money into banks, any widespread cuts in 
dividends would seem to put stocks at risk of a substantial decline. 
</P>
<P>
When Fed Chairman Greenspan was President Gerald R. Ford's chief economic 
adviser, he started a campaign to Whip Inflation Now, and handed out WIN 
buttons. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's time for the Fed to realize it's time to move from WIN to LOSE (Lift 
Our Sluggish Economy) so we can have a DRAW (Deliberate Recovery At Work).

CABLE INDUSTRY BATTLING CHANGES IN PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
TAXES: THE ISSUE HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL STATEWIDE SINCE THE 
MID-1980S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To hear the cable television companies tell it, Orange County Tax Assessor 
Bradley Jacobs is picking on cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
The cable companies claim that Jacobs' method of determining the value of 
property for tax purposes is using the industry as a test case for a new 
assessment procedure that will eventually hit all businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But Jacobs, who won't comment publicly on the cable industry's charges, is no 
renegade. Following the lead of tax assessors in other California counties, he 
has reassessed cable television properties in a way that he claims reflects 
their true market value. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful cable lobby is fighting back, and the fierce battle is now focused 
on Orange County. There a group of 10 cable operators allege in a lawsuit that 
Jacobs has violated their constitutional rights, with huge tax increases 
without due process. And they charge in shrill newspaper advertisements that 
the sharp increases in property tax assessments -- in some cases more than 
tripling them -- will raise consumer bills by as much as $2 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't like cable television, doesn't like the product," said John F. 
Gibbs, vice president of Continental Cablevision's Southern California 
operations and the lead spokesman for the group. "It's either a vendetta or the 
beginning of a crusade." 
</P>
<P>
The highly personal nature of the attack on Jacobs, however, obscures the fact 
that property tax assessments on cable television systems have become an 
increasingly controversial issue throughout California since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In Yuba, Sutter, Stanislaus and San Diego counties, local tax assessors have 
been trying, with the support of officials at the State Board of Equalization, 
to increase the assessments of cable properties to what they say is market 
value. And a number of other counties, including Los Angeles, are poised to 
join the movement. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County fracas has brought into focus a statewide dispute that 
involves tens of millions of potential tax dollars, millions of cable 
subscribers and will likely be resolved -- years from now -- by the state 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
The cable industry, with a San Francisco-based legal team shuttling up and down 
the state, has fought the new assessments every step of the way and even 
managed two years ago to push a bill through the Legislature that supports its 
position. 
</P>
<P>
It's not hard to see why the cable industry has taken the offensive on the 
property tax issue. In Orange County, the 10 cable television operators say 
their collective tax bills have skyrocketed from $2.4 million in 1988 to $7.7 
million in 1989. They also have been hit with a one-time charge of $8.5 million 
for re-assessments for 1985 through 1988. Appeals hearings on the controversial 
assessments began this week in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In Yuba and Sutter counties, Continental Cablevision and the two tax assessors 
have been fighting for years over whether the value of the bi-county cable 
system property is closer to $13 million or $37 million. In Stanislaus County, 
the assessment on the Post-Newsweek cable system was increased from $5.5 
million to $16.1 million for 1982, and the two parties have been arguing in 
court on the issue since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Such large increases in property taxes, the cable companies say, will be passed 
on to consumers. In Orange County, rate hikes of $1 to $2 a month for basic 
cable are in the offing, and some companies have already added a surcharge to 
customer bills. 
</P>
<P>
The largest cable operators in Orange County are Paragon Cable and Dimension 
Cable, which serves most of the county's southern portion. Dimension is a 
subsidiary of Times Mirror Co., which also owns the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Lying behind the sharp assessment increases is a fundamental conflict over the 
way the systems should be valued. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state Constitution, property taxes may be levied only on real 
property, including real estate and any permanent improvements made on the real 
estate, and personal property, which includes tangible assets -- office 
equipment, for example -- that are not considered real property. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the right to use public lands or rights-of-way for private gain, 
known as possessory interest, is also valued as property and subject to 
taxation. But the Constitution specifically excludes "intangibles," such as 
goodwill -- which includes the inherent value of a customer base -- and 
enterprise activity, from property tax assessments. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, tax assessors simply computed the replacement value of the 
cables, converters, satellite dishes and other hardware that go into a cable 
television system and then added to that a possessory interest valuation that 
was based on the franchise fee that the company paid to the county or city. 
That's the approach cable companies continue to support. 
</P>
<P>
But with the dramatic increase in the market value of cable television systems 
during the 1980s -- as reflected in the sale price of the numerous systems that 
were bought and sold during that time -- it became clear that the traditional 
assessment method yielded values that were only a fraction of the worth of 
cable systems on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
David Brown, assistant assessor for Yuba County, recalls that when the local 
system was sold to Continental Cablevision by McClatchy Newspapers, the system 
was valued on the tax rolls at $7 million. But the acquisition price was $35 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"We were aware of what was paid, and we wanted to know what the difference was 
between $7 million and $35 million," Brown said. "They said the difference was 
in the intangibles. But we said they had a very valuable leasehold, a 
possessory interest, and when you combine that with the other assets, that's 
the unit that has to be appraised." 
</P>
<P>
Does the high value of cable television systems reflect the high value of the 
taxable property or the high value of tax-exempt intangibles? Not surprisingly, 
many tax assessors -- who assert that the cable companies' de facto monopoly 
makes the possessory interest extremely valuable -- say it's the former. The 
cable companies, who strenuously deny they hold monopolies, insist that it is 
the latter. 
</P>
<P>
The state Board of Equalization establishes guidelines on how county tax 
assessors should go about their work. Generally, assessors can judge value by 
three methods: replacement cost of the property; income produced by the 
property, or the sales price fetched on the open market of a comparable 
property. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of cable TV franchises, however, the Board of Equalization in 1987 
withdrew guidelines for assessments of cable companies based on the replacement 
cost approach. The Board's staff advocated a new method that considered income 
and comparable sales, which would produce sharply higher assessments. 
</P>
<P>
The staff recommendations are contained in a draft of a new assessors handbook 
that was promulgated in late 1988 but has not yet been formally approved by the 
state board. But that hasn't stopped the assessors in Orange, Yuba, Sutter, 
Stanislaus and San Diego counties from adopting the new guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"The assessors are gradually buying into the concepts in the draft," said Verne 
Walton, chief of the assessment standards division at the Board of 
Equalization. He hopes the draft will go before the full board for approval 
this fall, but acknowledges that it faces strong opposition from the cable 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The document has been distributed for their comments, and we haven't heard 
anything from them," he said. "But they're going to object to most everything 
we've said." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs portrays the new guidelines as the work of a few Board of Equalization 
staffers, who then went out "looking for some assessors to follow their lead" 
in an effort to establish the new principles. He maintains that the assessments 
in Stanislaus, Yuba, Sutter and now Orange County are "dramatically the 
exception" and that the move towards the new assessment approach "is not 
picking up a head of steam very fast." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the cable industry was concerned enough about the trend to push 
legislation, sponsored by Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) and passed in 1988, that 
endorsed the use of the cost approach in assessing cable television properties. 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) earlier this month introduced another bill to 
limit assessor's latitude in taxing cable television. 
</P>
<P>
And it's clear that assessors in many jurisdictions are at least considering a 
new approach to cable valuations. "We've been working on an appraisal method 
that we feel will reflect the market value," said Marvin Lane, principal 
assessor for Los Angeles County. "We're still studying the situation, trying to 
find a method that will stand up in court." 
</P>
<P>
"It's in a state of flux -- a very difficult situation," Lane added. And he 
said the cable industry was "the most aggressive industry I've ever seen in 
fighting this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs, however, expressed disbelief that the Los Angeles County assessor would 
adopt anything resembling what Jacobs has done in Orange County. In fact, he 
says, Jacobs has gone far beyond what the Stanislaus, Yuba, and Sutter County 
assessors have done. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orange County method yields assessments 30% higher than the Sutter County 
method," he said. While the Northern California counties have reached their 
figures by placing a high value on the possessory interest, Orange County has 
assigned the high value to the real property. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs has declined to comment on the controversy, citing the pending 
litigation. Ron Cooper, deputy assessor for Orange County, said the method for 
allocating value to different components of the system was "insignificant." The 
cable systems are valued as a unit first, based on income and comparable sales, 
and then the dollars are allocated to different components. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County method places virtually all the value of a cable system in 
the property, rather than in any intangibles, and yields a result which Cooper 
said is "identical to other counties" that have adopted the new method. 
</P>
<P>
Walton of the Board of Equalization agreed that the allocation of costs was far 
less important than that determination of the total value for the system. He 
added that the Orange County assessments appeared to be quite similar to those 
in the other counties. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Janette, chief of evaluation for the San Diego County assessor's office, 
said the county is doing "exactly what Orange County has done," although the 
new assessments have been held in abeyance until the legal situation can be 
clarified. San Diego helped establish the principle of taxing cable company 
franchise rights as a possessory interest in a landmark case involving Cox 
Cable. 
</P>
<P>
The tortuous process by which tax assessments are appealed assures that a clear 
resolution of the issue is some years away. Companies that object to their 
assessments first appeal to an assessment appeals board, which is appointed by 
the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
If either the assessor or the taxpayer doesn't like the appeals board decision, 
they can take the case to Superior Court. The court, in turn, will often remand 
the case back to the appeals board with instructions. The Superior Court 
decision can also be appealed to the State Appellate Court. 
</P>
<P>
Although a series of appellate court decisions -- some involving non-cable 
businesses -- have clarified some of the principles at issue in the cable TV 
cases, the legal situation remains murky. In the most important ruling so far, 
a California appellate court issued a decision in September on the Stanislaus 
County case that both sides immediately claimed as a victory. In that decision, 
the court ruled that although intangible property could not be taxed, assessors 
could consider how the intangibles might enhance the value of taxable property. 
Thus, though the company's franchise to operate a cable system might be an 
intangible, the assessor could consider how the value of its possessory 
interest in rights-of-way along the streets might be enhanced by the right to 
do business. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the court noted that intangible property could only be taxed 
via an income tax, not a property tax. And in a second case in the same county, 
a Superior Court judge cited the appeals court ruling in rejecting the 
assessors' high valuation of the property. So the cable companies have been 
able to claim a legal victory as well. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the assessments against the 10 local cable firms have just 
begun their long journey through the appeals process: The first assessment 
appeals board hearings were held last week. 
</P>
<P>
The cable companies have indicated their intention to challenge the assessments 
on a broad range of points. They object not only to the basic principle of 
using an income and comparable-sales approach rather than a cost approach, but 
also to the allocation of value among real property, personal property and 
possessory interest. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit, they have also challenged the assessments as discriminatory and a 
violation of their due process rights. Other media properties, such as 
newspapers and broadcast television stations, are not assessed at anything 
approaching their market value as operating companies, the cable firms point 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the issue seems likely to be resolved by the appellate court or the 
state Supreme Court, if the legislature does not intervene with a new law 
before then. And while many assessors acknowledge that the legal outcome is far 
from certain, one thing is clear: The eventual result will have nothing to do 
with whether Brad Jacobs likes television.

FOR AMERICAN GROWERS, THE FUTURE IS SPELLED F-U-J-I 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<P>
YAKIMA, Wash 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Toyotas on American roads and the Sonys in American recreation rooms may 
soon be joined by Fujis in American lunch boxes -- a Japanese-bred apple that 
seems to be the fruit of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Growers say Japanese bud wood grafted onto trees in the central Washington 
apple belt produces an apple that is crisper, tastier and more durable than Red 
Delicious, the industry standard since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
The Fujis also are bringing much higher wholesale prices -- not a minor 
consideration after three consecutive years of poor prices that have caused 
many growers to reassess the heart-shaped Red Delicious. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be more change in the apple industry in the state of Washington in 
the next 10 years than in the last 30," said Brooke Peterson, a Washington 
State University tree-fruit extension agent in Yakima County. 
</P>
<P>
He likened Washington apple growers, who produce 60% of the nation's crop, to 
U.S. auto makers who were "so big and so successful for so long" that they 
failed to respond to the Japanese challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden they are nipping us in the heels," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, growers must produce a better and more diversified product, he 
said. Currently, 70% of Washington's apple crop is Red Delicious. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a revolution in supplying the public with an apple more satisfactory 
to their needs," said Grady Auvil, a legendary grower from Orondo who pioneered 
Washington production of the tangy Granny Smith a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Auvil, 84 years old and still out in his Columbia River orchard every day, is 
planting only Fujis on his 500 acres now. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty to 30% of the time the Red Delicious arrives to consumers in poor 
condition," Auvil said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fuji, first bred in Japan 35 years ago, has a longer shelf life, and 
shrivels on the outside before it softens inside, Auvil said. Too often, 
consumers complain of biting into a good-looking Red Delicious that is mealy. 
</P>
<P>
Tastes in apples change just as tastes in clothing, music or other products 
change, some growers say. Where consumers once clamored for bright red colors 
and the heart shape, now they are demanding better taste. 
</P>
<P>
The oblong-shaped Fuji has dull red stripes over a greenish-yellow base. 
</P>
<P>
Red Delicious apples cover more than 120,000 of the state's 160,000 acres of 
apple orchards. Trees take several years to bear fruit, so it will be some time 
before a flood of Fujis hits supermarkets, said Chuck St. John, a spokesman for 
the Washington Apple Commission. 
</P>
<P>
He also said it is much too early to write off the Red Delicious. "It is not an 
inherently bad apple. Otherwise consumers wouldn't buy it," he said. "We can 
grow Red Delicious and Golden Delicious better than they can be grown almost 
anyplace else in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Delicious first was produced in a Midwest orchard in 1870 and was 
transported to Washington soon after. By 1915, the state was the nation's 
leading apple producer. 
</P>
<P>
But growers are now struggling. Two seasons ago, the crop was severely damaged 
by excessive heat, and last year's sales and prices were hurt by the Alar 
controversy. This year, the record crop of 78 million 42-pound boxes of eating 
apples has been bringing prices beneath the cost of production. 
</P>
<P>
Where boxes of Red Delicious sell for about $10 per box wholesale, Fujis sell 
for up to $40, said Jeff Main of the Market News Service in Yakima. 
</P>
<P>
Market News Service does not officially record Fuji prices, because there are 
so few available, he said. But it is likely that will change in the next three 
or four years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fuji craze is reminiscent of the rush to plant Granny Smiths a decade ago. 
That tart apple now accounts for 5.5% of the state's crop. 
</P>
<P>
When Granny Smiths debuted, they too brought much higher prices. Now they are 
bringing about $15 per box, still better than Red Delicious.

THERE'S NOTHING FAIR ABOUT THE AIR FARES IN CALIFORNIA'S BUSY NORTH-SOUTH 
CORRIDOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Misleading apologies for airline-industry practices that were articulated by 
two Brookings Institution fellows in the June 17 Viewpoints ("Californians 
Getting a Fair Deal on Air Travel") merit my response. 
</P>
<P>
* The authors suggest that airline "profits amount to only about 4 cents out of 
every fare dollar." But where are the profits coming from? Not the Los 
Angeles-to-New York market, where fares are about 3.3 cents per seat-mile. The 
profits are coming from the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco market, where fares 
have been running 65 cents per mile. The fact is, California fares amount to a 
de facto subsidy for out-of-state fares, and that's unfair. The Public 
Utilities Commission report revealed that air fares in California, adjusted for 
inflation, rose 40% from 1979 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The experience of Southwest Airlines, one of the few low-cost airlines today, 
exposes the fare-gouging practices of the rest of the industry. Before 
Southwest entered the Burbank-to-Oakland market, fares were averaging $186. 
After their entry, the unrestricted fare dropped to $59. 
</P>
<P>
* Contrary to what the article suggests, air fares have very little to do with 
what it costs to provide service. Even the airline industry itself, at a Senate 
committee hearing I sponsored on April 2 at Los Angeles International Airport, 
admitted that air fares are based on what "the market will bear." 
</P>
<P>
* Mergers have had a negative impact. Over the last few years, the Department 
of Transportation approved every airline merger proposal. As a result, the 
eight biggest carriers control 92% of the domestic market. California was 
especially hard-hit, losing not only its home-based airlines such as PSA and 
AirCal, but also its principal low-fare competitors. 
</P>
<P>
After these airlines were taken over, fares went up and ridership went down in 
the north-south corridor -- the busiest in the nation -- to 8 million in 1989 
from 12.5 million in 1987. Clearly, fares are having an adverse effect on the 
air traveler. 
</P>
<P>
* The authors boast that the number of viable competitors in the Los 
Angeles-Sacramento market is up to 3.5 from 2.7. But how can we proclaim the 
arrival of competition when all 3.5 charge a $456 unrestricted fare? 
</P>
<P>
If the airline industry will not listen to the public, perhaps legislation to 
directly improve competition stands a better chance of getting their attention. 
The direction of air fares in California in the months ahead is the message 
consumers are awaiting from the airlines.

CELLULAR PHONE PIECE GAVE WRONG IMPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Cellular Blues" article in the June 10 Viewpoints contains information 
that is likely to leave an erroneous impression with your readers. Here are 
some facts that give a more accurate picture of the cellular industry in 
general and L.A. Cellular in particular: 
</P>
<P>
* The statement that cellular companies operate a "fixed-cost business" and do 
little more than pocket their profits once a system is built is completely 
untrue. When L.A. Cellular began operations in 1987, we had invested about $34 
million in equipment and facilities before any income was received. Since then, 
L.A. Cellular has invested an additional $120 million to improve and expand 
service to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
* While it is true that cellular demand in Los Angeles is very high, it is also 
true that L.A. Cellular's investment in its system has substantially exceeded 
its after-tax income. Since 1985, L.A. Cellular has had a $33-million net 
negative cash return, largely due to the increasing demand for cellular 
service, which requires that we continually reinvest earnings in new and more 
technologically advanced equipment. 
</P>
<P>
* Between now and 1992, L.A. Cellular is committed to spending more than $200 
million toward the conversion to digital technology to ensure quality service 
to our customers. For most cellular customers, the critical issues are 
geographic coverage and service quality. L.A. Cellular's first priority is to 
give our customers as much coverage as possible while reducing "dropped calls" 
and electronic interference. 
</P>
<P>
* It is important to note that despite the fact that we have invested millions 
of dollars in new equipment and technology, inflation that has affected every 
aspect of our operations and the addition of new services at no additional 
charge to our customers, there have been no price increases at L.A. Cellular. 
</P>
<P>
* An important part of the cost of cellular service is the cost of the cellular 
telephone. The price of cellular equipment has dropped by more than 50% in 
recent years, and prices should continue to fall as the cellular phone business 
matures. 
</P>
<P>
The recent decision by the California Public Utilities Commission loosening 
restrictions on reducing cellular prices will enhance cellular carriers' 
ability to respond to consumer needs and thus will benefit customers. Increased 
regulation would have the opposite effect. The PUC has decided that it will not 
punish companies who reinvest their profits in cellular system improvements. 
This promises to bring the benefits of cellular communication to every corner 
of the state, a worthy goal that all Californians should support. We do.

NEW TAXES: WHO SHOULD PAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sharon Bernstein, Free-lance journalist 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that President Bush has abandoned his "no new taxes" pledge, the question 
confronting lawmakers is: which new taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 Free-lance journalist Sharon Bernstein interviewed several prominent 
economists and business leaders for their views on how to increase taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Murray Weidenbaum 
</P>
<P>
Director of the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington 
University in St. Louis; adviser to President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Conceptually, the best taxes are ones that have the least adverse effect on the 
work ethic, savings and investment. These tend to be consumption taxes rather 
than income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
If you raise the marginal tax on income, that reduces the incentive to work 
longer. On the other hand, if they raise your sales tax it doesn't affect the 
amount of after-tax income. If you work harder, you're still going to make more 
money. If you work longer you're going to make more money. If a business takes 
more risk, it will increase income. 
</P>
<P>
I sure wouldn't encourage an increase in the corporate profit tax, which is an 
income tax. We are a high consumption, low savings society, so if we have to 
increase taxes, let's tax consumption. Economically, it makes good sense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
John Kenneth Galbraith 
</P>
<P>
Professor of economics, Harvard University; adviser to presidents Johnson and 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't object to raising the gasoline tax -- it's too low. And if they want 
to tax tobacco and whiskey more, that's all right with me. But overwhelmingly, 
the revenue should come out of the income tax. And that would mean eliminating 
the "bubble" that reduces the marginal rate for the highest bracket and putting 
the tax on ability to pay. I can't say how much rates should increase -- that's 
a subject for long discussion and long negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
I would not increase corporate taxes. The corporate tax does not have as clear 
a relationship to ability to pay, which is the civilized and fundamental test 
of a good tax. If the government wants a modest increase in corporate taxes, 
I'm not going to oppose it, but I'm not going to make it as a substitute for 
the personal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Michael Reich 
</P>
<P>
Professor of economics, UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
I would support what's called a "turnover tax" on the stock market of 0.5%. 
Every time you buy or sell stock, you pay 0.5% of the amount to the government. 
Other countries have it. You could have it just on short-term turnover, on 
shares that have been held for less than six months or a year. It would 
discourage people and institutions from holding shares for such a short time. 
It would help in allowing companies to have a longer-term time horizon. 
</P>
<P>
I think it would change the relation between ownership and management of 
companies. It would bring the owners a little closer. If they felt they were 
long-term owners, they might feel more involved. They might help the company 
adopt a long-term perspective instead of dropping it as soon as the price went 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Another tax I'd be in favor of is a tax on legal services. The idea is to 
create disincentives to use legal services, because I think they're overused. I 
would do it above a certain threshold, so it would affect corporations instead 
of individuals. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases these are progressive taxes. They would mainly be borne by those 
most able to pay. But they would also have policy effects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Overton 
</P>
<P>
Vice president for tax, Monsanto Co. 
</P>
<P>
If tax increases are imposed, we favor a broad-based, low-rate, invoice-method, 
value-added tax. This tax is not only neutral between savings and consumption 
but helps level the playing field between the United States and its major 
trading partners, as most, if not all, have such a tax. 
</P>
<P>
Any new tax revenue should be used solely for deficit reduction and not new 
spending programs. Under the free market system, workers keep more of their 
earnings so that they, not the government, make the decision on how, when and 
where to invest and spend their money. 
</P>
<P>
Taking into account federal, state and local taxes, government today claims 
about one-third of the nation's resources. More importantly, this percentage 
has steadily increased over the years, with no end in sight. The real question 
becomes, at what point does the government's claim on the nation's wealth 
become so great as to jeopardize our free market system. 
</P>
<P>
To help focus this debate, we believe it would be helpful if Congress could 
establish revenue and spending goals so that everybody could have a clear, 
identifiable and understandable target as to where America's economic future 
lies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
David M. Gordon 
</P>
<P>
Professor of economics, New School for Social Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
I would increase rates in the top personal income bracket to undo some of the 
damage done in the 1980s. I would push the rates on the top brackets back up to 
38%, which is where they were before the last stage of tax reform, and pausing 
for breath at that point and assessing the need for further tax reform in view 
of further revenue needs. 
</P>
<P>
I would rather concentrate on personal tax rates rather than corporate tax 
rates. There is a legitimate argument made about double taxation of income if 
you tax both corporate and personal income. 
</P>
<P>
I would also seriously consider something like (Sen. Daniel Patrick) Moynihan's 
proposal to reduce social security tax rates, since really the two things on 
the personal tax side that have contributed to such a regressive realignment in 
the 1980s were both the dramatic slashing of personal income tax rates in top 
brackets and increasing of social security tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
A value-added tax or a national sales tax would have a regressive impact, and 
the tax system has been pushed in a regressive direction for long enough. 
</P>
<P>
The strong preference of many economists for sales taxes is based on the idea 
that the way to revitalize the economy and revitalize investment is to try to 
curb consumption expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
I disagree with that logic fundamentally. That mainstream argument is based on 
a core idea of profit-led growth. It says the way to stimulate growth is to 
fatten profits and savings. We tried to do that in every way we could during 
the 1980s and it hasn't worked. Less affluent families have increased personal 
borrowing tremendously in order to keep themselves afloat. So a byproduct of 
efforts to cut wages and cut consumption is that families have gone more into 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lee A. Iacocca 
</P>
<P>
Chairman, Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The best way I know to increase revenue is to tap some people who have been 
getting a free ride in this country for too long -- foreign companies who do 
hundreds of billions of dollars worth of business in this market every year but 
pay virtually no income tax. 
</P>
<P>
There is a simple way to make them pay their fair share. It's called a business 
transfer tax. It is a type of value-added tax that would work like this: 
</P>
<P>
A tax would be imposed on all goods sold in this market. It would be paid by 
American and foreign producers alike but with a couple of important wrinkles. 
First, the tax would be rebated on exports by American companies. Second, 
American companies would be able to offset the tax by deducting it from their 
U.S. income or payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
So, for U.S. companies, it would be a wash. The business transfer tax would 
substitute dollar for dollar for taxes they now pay. But since foreign 
producers don't pay those U.S. taxes, there would be no substitution and all of 
their payments would represent new revenue flowing into the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
A 7% business transfer tax would mean a net increase of $42 billion a year for 
Washington, with no tax increase for individual Americans or American 
businesses.

PRESERVING A TRADITION OF GOOD TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
E. Waldo Ward &amp; Son is an unexpected world of gourmet smells. 
</P>
<P>
Cloves, cinnamon and ginger scents rose from an antiquated electric grinder 
where Jeffrey Ward, 24, worked on a recent morning in Sierra Madre. In two 
stainless-steel kettles, sliced circles of onions topped a steaming meat sauce 
made from a family recipe. 
</P>
<P>
Next to another 100-gallon kettle, Jeffrey's father, Richard, 55, stirred a 
long spatula in a stewing batch of Oregon red raspberries. 
</P>
<P>
Two women spooned nine-ounce portions of mango chutney, taken from barrels 
shipped from Bombay, India, into jars. A vinegary smell wafted from tubs of 
green olives, imported from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Among the large lots and big houses on East Highland Avenue in this tiny town 
hard against the San Gabriel foothills, Waldo Ward &amp; Son, in a rambling 
warehouse beside a Victorian house and red barn, is hardly noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
For 99 years, the Wards have been canning and preserving oranges, kumquats and 
other fruits and condiments. Much of the produce is grown on Ward land in the 
San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Today, three generations of Ward men operate the business from the three-acre 
plot where the homestead and barn were built in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
The recipes are time-tested, many of them gathered by the founder, the late E. 
Waldo Ward Sr., who took lengthy trips selling gourmet food around the West in 
the early part of this century. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't give a damn about volume," said Jeffrey's grandfather, 87-year-old E. 
Waldo Ward Jr. "We give a damn about quality product." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey said: "We have a niche, selling to people who want better quality. 
That's where we come in, like a Rolls-Royce." 
</P>
<P>
Waldo, Richard and Jeffrey: Each proudly speaks of following in his father's 
footsteps and of being firmly planted in Sierra Madre. The three bachelors 
(Waldo's wife died in 1971, and Richard was divorced 10 years ago) live 
together in the Victorian house. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't another place like it in Sierra Madre where you have the same 
family living on a place for four generations," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Waldo, a Pomona College chemistry major in the 1920s, why he never left 
Sierra Madre, and he will look at you as if you're crazy to suggest he might 
have. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Richard, who graduated from UC Davis with a degree in agricultural 
economics in 1957, and he acknowledges that he wasn't sure that he would uphold 
tradition. In fact, he worked six years for Del Monte Foods Inc. in the Bay 
Area. But he said he found that "when you work for a large company, you just 
feel like you're a smaller cog in the works." 
</P>
<P>
Ask Jeffrey, Richard's only son (his two daughters aren't affiliated with the 
business), and he says he wanted to work in the family firm since he was 12. He 
majored in food science and technology at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
In an office cluttered with everything from the mounted skin of a diamondback 
rattlesnake killed in the groves to black-and-white photographs of himself as a 
boy, Waldo Jr. held forth on his marmalade birthright. 
</P>
<P>
Waldo Sr., he said, developed tuberculosis when he worked for a New York fancy 
foods company and in 1887 headed west for drier air. He eventually settled in 
Sierra Madre, then a mecca for tuberculosis patients. 
</P>
<P>
He bought 10 acres for a house and orange groves, developed his own thriving 
marmalade line and shipped oranges back East by the crate. He even imported to 
Sierra Madre two trees from Seville, Spain, which is known for its tart 
oranges. 
</P>
<P>
Ward obtained many recipes when, as a traveling salesman, he met women recently 
arrived from Great Britain, where they had worked in preserves factories. Now 
typed on 3-by-5 cards, the recipes still are used in the business, which 
employs two dozen workers during peak periods. 
</P>
<P>
As business expanded -- railway companies, for example, bought his 
British-style marmalade -- he acquired more land. Ward's preserves graced 
breakfast tables in Southern Pacific and Santa Fe dining cars and in railroad 
hotels at depots across the West. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Wards have sold groves to be subdivided, but they say they 
have no plans to sell out. Waldo Ward pointed to a computer and a fax machine 
-- recent additions, thanks to his grandson, who wants to expand their 
mail-order business. Just last year, the firm began accepting credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Ward has filled orders for many California establishments, including Knott's 
Berry Farm, Jurgensen's Groceries and Pea Soup Andersen's Restaurants. "In the 
'20s," he said, "we used to sell to all the good stores in Boston and New York 
City." 
</P>
<P>
Outside, Richard Ward surveyed the palms, the fruit-heavy orange trees and the 
San Gabriel foothills to the north. He passed under a tin-roofed shed where the 
morning sun cured walnuts. As he headed in to finish a batch of red raspberry 
preserves, he said: "You get spoiled living here."

Hsi Lai Temple, the largest Buddhist monastery in the Western Hemisphere, will 
begin offering bachelor's and master's degrees next year, becoming one of a 
handful of Buddhist organizations licensed by the state to confer college 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
State education officials July 2 gave permission to the 2-year-old temple to 
open a private school that will grant bachelor's degrees in Buddhist studies 
and master's degrees in religious studies. The temple is a branch of Fo Kuang 
Shan, Taiwan's largest Buddhist organization. 
</P>
<P>
The school will open next spring with from 50 to 100 students, 10 faculty 
members, and a handful of advisers, said Venerable Yung Kai, a nun at the 
temple who is serving as acting academic affairs officer. 
</P>
<P>
It will be run out of the Hacienda Heights temple at first. Eventually, the 
Buddhists plan to open a full-fledged university at another location that will 
teach a wider range of subjects, including philosophy, business management and 
humanities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Through teachings, which will be in English, the Buddhist leaders want to 
promote "a cultural exchange between the East and West," Yung Kai said. 
"Hopefully, we will contribute to world peace." 
</P>
<P>
The United States was not the first choice of temple officials. Originally, 
they wanted the school close to the Fo Kuang Shan temple in Taiwan, which is 10 
times the size of the Hacienda Heights temple. But that idea met with 
resistance from the Taiwanese government, which Yung Kai termed "very 
restrictive" when it comes to licensing colleges run by religious 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
There are Buddhist colleges in Taiwan, but none are government-approved, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So after the Hacienda Heights temple opened in 1988, the Venerable Hsing Yun, 
Fo Kuang Shan's leader, turned his attention from Taiwan to Southern 
California. The area is a prime location for a university campus, Yung Kai 
said, because it can draw on the expertise of American Buddhist scholars. 
</P>
<P>
One such scholar is Lewis Lancaster, a UC Berkeley professor in the Department 
of Oriental Languages who is serving as an adviser to Hsi Lai Temple. He said 
he may teach at the new school as a visiting lecturer. Lancaster also is 
heading a Fo Kuang Shan project to record Buddhist scriptures on compact disc 
so they can be viewed on a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster said that although a Buddhist college here is akin to Catholic or 
Protestant schools in China, it may seem "very strange to us (that) a Buddhist 
group comes into our environment and offers this kind of instruction. I think 
it's wonderful. It's time for all of us to realize we do live in a global 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Hsi Lai Temple, with its glistening tiled roofs, traditional Chinese 
pagoda-style architecture and towering, brightly painted statues, has become 
something of an American tourist attraction as well as a solemn retreat for the 
East San Gabriel Valley's burgeoning Asian population. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-building, 15-acre complex is one of about 50 temples that Fo Kuang Shan 
owns around the world. The Buddhist organization is planning to break ground 
soon on another temple in Sydney, Australia.

program for sexually abused children in the San Gabriel Valley, has lost 
$120,000 in state-awarded money -- roughly half the program's yearly funding. 
Unless an appeal Tuesday in Sacramento is successful, the agency will be forced 
to scale back its program of aid to nearly 1,000 abused children annually, 
Foothill Executive Director David Eisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
That means that sexually molested children in the San Gabriel Valley, who now 
face delays of up to two months before being seen by a counselor, could wait 
even longer before treatment, Eisenberg said. In addition, the number of 
children and their parents counseled annually could be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kids and families in crisis, as if they were in an emergency room 
from a car accident," Eisenberg said. "Imagine a rape victim not being able to 
get psychological support for months. You have to remember we're talking about 
little kids who have been raped." 
</P>
<P>
Foothill is one of the few agencies in the county and the only one in the San 
Gabriel Valley that specializes in counseling sexually abused children, 
Eisenberg said. Other local agencies offer such counseling, but do not make it 
a specialty, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For help in a similarly specialized setting, families must trek to San Fernando 
Child Guidance in the San Fernando Valley, Children's Institute International 
in Los Angeles, Children's Treatment Services in Santa Monica or the Barbara 
Sinatra Children's Center in Rancho Mirage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena center's loss of funds comes at a time when demand for services is 
rising, Eisenberg said, adding, "We've had 10 cases referred in the last 10 
work days. It's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
For decades, the nonprofit agency at 118 S. Oak Knoll Ave. in Pasadena has 
provided basic "meat and potatoes" psychotherapy and family counseling, 
Eisenberg said. More than 3,500 clients were seen last year by 25 staff members 
and 20 contract clinicians, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Foothill's sexual abuse program is unique because most other agencies in 
the San Gabriel Valley deal with physically abused and neglected children, 
Eisenberg said. The Pasadena agency concentrates on sexually abused children. 
</P>
<P>
State funding for that program was lost when a three-year grant from the 
California Office of Criminal Justice Planning was not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill was one of a dozen agencies first awarded money in 1987 when the state 
received federal money under the federal Victims of Crime Act. When the 
three-year grants came up for renewal this year, about 40 agencies statewide 
competed for $1.2 million in federal funds, twice the number that had applied 
previously, said Greg Alterton, a spokesman for the Office of Criminal Justice 
Planning. 
</P>
<P>
In the stiffer competition, Foothill and two other agencies in Los Angeles 
County that had previously received funds found themselves empty handed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like they got an F," Alterton said of Foothill. "They would have 
gotten a passing grade. Had we had enough money, they would have gotten 
funded." 
</P>
<P>
Because the funds come from the federal government, the grants are not affected 
by the state budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
If Tuesday's appeal to the state fails, Eisenberg said he will ask the Pasadena 
Board of Directors for one year's funding. The board last week referred the 
request to the city Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill will also apply to foundations to establish an endowment that will 
ensure ongoing operation of the program, Eisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"I see taking care of victimized children as about as basic as police 
services," Eisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
According to 1988 figures from the Department of Social Services, more than 
19,000 children in the San Gabriel Valley were physically abused that year and 
another 3,000 sexually abused, Eisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill counseled 966 sexually abused children last year, enabling them to 
tell about their abuse in a safe environment, to recover from post-traumatic 
stress and to re-establish basic trust, Eisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids come in suicidal, others are profoundly depressed, and others are 
agitated and acting out sexually, masturbating and fondling other kids," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After 16 weeks to three years of counseling, such children can be transformed, 
said Foothill clinical social worker Pat Avery. "They blossom. We have to warn 
their parents that they have a new, happy, talking child."

DIE-HARD FANS PUT A FEW MORE MILES ON AZUSA'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH ROUTE 66 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Naranjo remembers when the McDonald's restaurant on Route 66 was the place 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
As a high school student in the 1970s, Naranjo served hamburgers and French 
fries to motorists and local teen-agers. "It was the happening thing to go in 
and have a burger" by the highway, the Azusa city councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Steinhelper took the same road west when her family moved from Ohio in 
1946. With a mobile home in tow, she and her 10-year-old daughter followed 
Route 66 to the orange groves of El Monte and later settled in Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Whitsell, a retired San Dimas chiropractor, has driven the road 40 times 
on his way to and from Indiana. "I can tell you every inch of Route 66," 
Whitsell said. "I pride myself on knowing it." 
</P>
<P>
They and more than 200 other fans of "America's Main Street" turned out last 
week at Azusa City Hall to honor the highway and swap stories about their 
travels on the historic route. 
</P>
<P>
"We're down to the end of the mother road," author and Route 66 historian 
Michael Wallis told the crowd, "but I know this is where the heart beats the 
strongest." 
</P>
<P>
Like other towns along the highway's 2,200 miles, the history of Azusa and 
Route 66 -- now known in Los Angeles as Foothill Boulevard, Colorado Boulevard, 
the Pasadena (110) Freeway and Santa Monica Boulevard -- are closely linked. 
</P>
<P>
Opened in 1926, Route 66 was the first fully paved highway from the Midwest to 
the West Coast. Beginning near Lake Michigan in Illinois, the road winds 
through seven states and three time zones before reaching California. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s, the road took displaced farmers west in 
search of an Eden-like California promoted by land developers. Many of these 
"Okies" settled in Azusa and other San Gabriel Valley towns where the citrus 
industry was booming. Their pilgrimage was immortalized in John Steinbeck's 
"The Grapes of Wrath." 
</P>
<P>
The military later used the route to transport men and equipment west during 
World War II. Soldiers returning from the war vacationed up and down the 
highway in the 1950s. Later, it gave its name to a television series. 
</P>
<P>
But more than just a source of transportation and business, Route 66 provided 
entertainment for locals, said Jack Williams, president of the Azusa Historical 
Society. "Families used to sit and watch the traffic go by," Williams said. 
"There wasn't anything to do except watch people." 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been the main street in our community," Azusa native Jenny Avila 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the 1960s, though, with the growth of the interstate highway 
system, the number of motorists traveling Route 66 steadily declined. 
</P>
<P>
When the last of Interstate 40 was finished in 1984 near Williams, Ariz., Route 
66 was bypassed by a network of five interstate highways and was expunged from 
most maps. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, fewer motorists travel the highway and much of the charm 
associated with it has been lost. "Things have changed," Naranjo said. "The 
communities have begun to break up. They've lost a warmth." 
</P>
<P>
Whitsell agrees. It is his memories of Route 66, not the current highway, that 
he loves. 
</P>
<P>
"You can stop anywhere along here and buy enough dope to kill you," he said. 
"It's changed to dope, nitwits, puke, filth, crime and crazies." 
</P>
<P>
Although Wallis acknowledges that Route 66 has seen some rough times, he 
believes it will be reborn in the 1990s. Route 66 associations have sprung up 
in the eight states the highway crosses, and a bill by Sen. Pete V. Domenici 
(R-N.M.) proposes to make the road a national monument, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Australian and European tourists have begun to take an interest in 
the highway and Japanese filmmakers have been seen scouting the road, Wallis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The strong survive" and with the help of people who have loved it, Route 66 
will continue as an American icon, Wallis said. "Today's the heyday of Route 
66."

Hand-woven Ecuadorean shawls, multicolored Guatemalan costumes and Huichol 
Indian suits gaily adorn the walls and ceiling of Pasadena's Folk Tree Gallery 
this month as part of a celebration of international textiles. 
</P>
<P>
The decorative items are all handcrafted -- woven, dyed, knotted and 
embroidered -- by natives of Mexico, South and Central America, China, India, 
Africa and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
Most are cotton. However, a rare silk huipil, or Guatemalan woman's blouse, is 
included in the display. 
</P>
<P>
The Folk Tree Gallery, founded four years ago by a former public school 
psychologist who has traveled extensively, is a store and gallery with folk art 
exhibits that change monthly. 
</P>
<P>
The objects in this month's exhibit were culled mostly from private 
collections, manager Kathy Oshima said. "Some of it has been in the United 
States for more than 50 years, and other pieces came off the backs of natives 
who just traded their clothing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The free exhibit runs through the end of this month at 217 S. Fair Oaks Ave., 
Pasadena. Hours are 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Wednesday and Saturday; 11 
a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday, and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. For more information, call 
(818) 795-8733. KAREN E. KLEIN

MALIBU HOTEL PROJECT STYMIED AS PANEL REJECTS SEWER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission has handed the Adamson Cos. a serious setback 
in its bid to develop a luxury hotel overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the state panel last week refused to approve an interim 
sewer plan for the planned $65-million, 300-room hotel. Without the approval, 
the firm, one of Malibu's largest landowners, would be prevented from starting 
construction until a regional sewer system that Los Angeles County wants to 
build in Malibu is in place. 
</P>
<P>
Adamson may reapply for approval after it conducts further studies, but that 
could take several months. 
</P>
<P>
The decision Wednesday came a day after the coastal panel refused to allow the 
county to speed construction of the proposed $43-million sewer system. The 
commission approved the hotel plan in 1986 but said the sewer system had to be 
installed before the hotel could open. 
</P>
<P>
The latest developments greatly increase the likelihood that the hotel's fate, 
and that of the sewer, will be left to Malibu's future City Council to help 
decide, once the community becomes a city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to realize there's a gorilla in the room, and that's the 
(future) City Council," Commissioner Gary Giacomini said. "Even if we approved 
(the company's) request, it could be undone later by the new City Council." 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel in Los Angeles has scheduled a hearing Wednesday to decide 
whether Malibu's incorporation, approved by voters last month, can go forward, 
or whether the county can delay cityhood until next March. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Adamson plan argued that it would be too risky to approve a 
septic-tank system for the 27-acre site near Pepperdine University when not 
enough is known about the possible consequences. The site is next to an 
earthquake fault and is susceptible to landslides. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld, a Malibu resident, said she would be astonished 
if the same county officials who call residential septic tanks in Malibu a 
health hazard approve septic tanks for the hotel complex, which would include a 
60,000-square-foot convention facility, several restaurants and a separate 
office building. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so many times greater than anything else that is on a septic system in 
Malibu as to be almost incalculable," Glickfeld said. The county has long cited 
the environmental damage caused by leaking septic tanks as the prime reason for 
insisting that the sewer system be built. 
</P>
<P>
Adamson had announced last week that it will join forces with the firm that 
owns the Hotel Bel-Air to develop and manage the Malibu hotel. Its partner, the 
Sazale Corp. of Japan, owns several other luxury hotels in the United States 
and France, including the Biltmore in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the interim sewer plan, the company must have the Coastal Commission 
approve its final grading plans before construction can begin. The commission 
is scheduled to consider the grading matter next month at its meeting in 
Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
Adamson, which has already spent more than $5 million on the hotel project, had 
hoped, like the county with its sewer system, to start work before Malibu 
becomes a city. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has done little to enhance its popularity among cityhood backers, who 
accused it of working behind the scenes to defeat cityhood in 1976. Last 
December, the company joined the county in a lawsuit to delay this year's 
cityhood vote. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, with cityhood appearing to be inevitable, company officials have 
made gestures aimed at healing the rift. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks before last month's incorporation election, Sylvia R. A. Neville, 
the firm's managing general partner, gave a rare interview to a Malibu 
newspaper in which she declared that she was in favor of cityhood. Other 
company officials have stated that they look forward to working with the new 
city on the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't received an unfavorable response from any of the council 
members-elect with respect to the hotel, and I would say that's encouraging," 
said Barna Szabo, a political consultant for the company, after last week's 
Coastal Commission hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Among those at the hearing who urged the commission to deny approval of the 
company's interim sewer plan was Sharon Adamson, whose late husband, Merritt, 
was managing general partner of the Adamson Cos. until his death in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Adamson is involved in a bitter legal battle with Neville and Rhoda-May 
Dallas, her former sisters-in-law, contending that she and her two adult 
children are owed one-third of the family's estimated $75-million fortune. She 
has accused Neville and Dallas of grossly mismanaging the company's assets. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the Coastal Commission, Sharon Adamson said that the hotel 
plan was "poorly conceived" and that if she and her children succeed in 
obtaining the hotel site as part of their share of the company's assets, "our 
plan (for the site) will be completely different." 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the hotel would include 11 low-lying, Spanish-style villas nestled 
into the hillside, surrounded by extensive landscaping, including streams and 
fountains. There would be a free-standing restaurant at the corner of Pacific 
Coast Highway and Malibu Canyon Road in addition to restaurants in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials say the villa design will be much less noticeable from the 
busy coastal highway, and its Spanish-style architecture will complement that 
of the nearby university.

TREES GO TO ROOT OF URBAN PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Joan Milke Flores and Gloria Molina are representative of the L.A. City 
Council's understanding of the importance of trees to our urban environment, 
then we are in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Trees are more important to all of us than we apparently realize. Few things 
offer us so much for so little. Trees offer shade from hot summer sun and 
harmful radiation due to the ozone depletion problem. Shade can cut cooling 
costs up to 40%. Trees can also lower heating bills by acting as windbreaks. 
Trees help combat "urban heat islands," which is the heat-gain in cities due to 
a concentration of buildings, traffic, and dark, paved surfaces. Up to 10% of 
urban electric demand is spent cooling buildings to compensate for this 
heat-gain. On a more global perspective, trees help reduce the "greenhouse 
effect" by replacing carbon dioxide (spewed into our atmosphere by cars, 
industries, etc.) with oxygen, which we can't live without. 
</P>
<P>
So dollar for dollar, we need to nourish and love the trees we already have. In 
addition, we need to plant many more of them. We must plan ahead for our oxygen 
supplies and reduction of electricity use which is produced by burning fossil 
fuels. 
</P>
<P>
The tree counting project is to help this urban area know where the trees are, 
and how to maintain them on a regular basis so they can provide all of the 
benefits enumerated above. An urban forest needs to be well-managed. Good 
management needs data. The tree counting project provides needed data. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said if the trees in the whole city couldn't be counted, then "they 
shouldn't do any of the city." Molina said, "I think it is more important to 
count police officers than it is to count trees . . ." And in the meantime, the 
city heats up, our oxygen supply needs help, and there is too much carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest an intensive course for the L.A. City Council in how to increase our 
oxygen supply, how to reduce electric use by greater dependence on a thriving 
and well-nourished urban forest, and how to think beyond mere politics.

LA VERNE ALSO MUST CONSIDER ECONOMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am all for preserving the small-town atmosphere in La Verne. In fact, it is 
one of the qualities that makes La Verne a special place to live. 
</P>
<P>
However, the reality of our time dictates that there must be a balance between 
the small-town quality and the economic stability of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. (Bob) Mastro (Times, July 8) says that Edwards (Cinema Co.) refuses to 
compromise on the size of the theaters. Edwards owns numerous successful 
theaters and knows what works and what does not. How many does Mr. Mastro own? 
</P>
<P>
Although I am not in the pharmacy business, using Mr. Mastro's logic, I am 
qualified to tell him how to run his business. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Mastro should reduce the size of his pharmacy to no more than 10 feet by 10 
feet. This would make a very quaint little store that would fit nicely into the 
small-town atmosphere he so desires.

4 TO RUN FOR BRYANT'S VACANT SEAT ON COUNCIL

Four candidates -- a man with a controversial plan to help the homeless, a 
planning commissioner, the leader of a downtown business group and a Latina 
community volunteer -- have filed to run for the City Council seat vacated by 
the recall of C.L. (Clay) Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates filed papers before the close of nominations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Running in the Sept. 18 election are George Bosy, 37, who houses the homeless 
at his Four Aces Motel and who wants to provide mobile homes for them at the 
site also; Boyd Bredenkamp, 49, who owns a doughnut shop and is in his sixth 
year on the Planning Commission; Bob Dahms, 33, a businessman who heads the 
Central Business District, and Nancy Lopez, 52, a housewife and community 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will succeed Bryant in representing District 3, which takes in the 
southeast quadrant of the city. Candidates must live within the district, but 
all of the city's 39,283 registered voters will be eligible to cast ballots in 
the special election. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will complete Bryant's term, which expires in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy is a newcomer to the city who has stirred controversy with his efforts to 
enlist the city's cooperation in a plan to shelter the homeless in mobile 
homes. He and his business partner, Mike Damico, have sought permission to 
house the homeless in mobile homes at their motel and to acquire other sites in 
the city for clusters of mobile homes for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
As councilman, Bryant championed Bosy's plan, and Bosy said he continues to 
admire the former councilman even though Bryant was recalled from office June 5 
by a 2-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Bosy said that he might not have agreed with Bryant on everything but that "he 
was the most dedicated man this city has ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Bredenkamp, who has been in business in Pomona 16 years, was among the leaders 
of the effort to recall Bryant and has picked up the backing of many of those 
who were active in the recall movement. 
</P>
<P>
Bredenkamp said he decided to run because "I'm tired of watching what's 
happening to our government." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, who is founder and president of the Hispanic Youth Task Force Committee, 
said she is basing her campaign on her longstanding opposition to Bryant. "I 
had the guts to run against him last year," she said, adding that now that 
Bryant is out of office, others are coming forward to seek the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Dahms, who has lived in Pomona for a dozen years, leads a business group that 
represents 400 businesses in downtown Pomona. He is running on a platform that 
calls for ending the city's political in-fighting and finding new sources of 
revenue to pay for more police, better schools and safer streets. "The 
political war must be replaced by a war on crime, drugs and gangs," he said.

For those looking for something to do today that mixes history and exercise, 
the Hollywood Heritage tour is just the thing. 
</P>
<P>
John Daugherty, one of the volunteers who give the three-hour tours of 
Hollywood Boulevard four times a year, will be available to point out some of 
the more interesting points along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look above the sometimes tacky facades to truly appreciate the 
boulevard," said Daugherty, who has given private tours for almost 10 years. 
"Look closely or you can miss the most interesting things." 
</P>
<P>
For example, a sculpted dragon peeks out above the front door of the Pacific 
Hollywood Building at 6425 Hollywood Blvd. A dancing pig is engraved above the 
Numero Uno pizza sign next to the Egyptian Theatre as a last remnant of the 
once-popular Pig and Whistle restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Furniture with the pig design is now in Miceli's Italian Restaurant around the 
corner at 1646 Las Palmas Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Some buildings along the boulevard, like the Chinese Theatre, are world famous. 
The Pantages Theatre at Argyle Avenue was the first Art Deco movie palace in 
the country. The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, once owned by Douglas Fairbanks and 
Mary Pickford, was the site of the first Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
The flashing light on top of the Capitol Records building (the first round 
office building in the country) spells out "Hollywood" in Morse code. 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty also has a plethora of celebrity trivia about the boulevard that 
includes: 
</P>
<P>
* Charlie Chaplin and Hedda Hopper had offices, now being restored, in the 
Guaranty Building at Ivar Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
* Silent stars stayed at the Hillview Apartments at 6531 Hollywood Blvd., 
because it was the only hotel at the time that would take actors. 
</P>
<P>
* The Knickerbocker Hotel at Ivar Avenue is where actress Frances Farmer was 
dragged off screaming to a mental institution and where Houdini's widow staged 
a seance on the roof to contact her husband. 
</P>
<P>
* Judy Garland dished out ice cream at C. C. Brown's, 7007 Hollywood Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
* Carol Burnett was fired as an usher at the Pacific Theatre, 6433 Hollywood 
Blvd. She later asked to have her Walk of Fame star put in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
* Writers Ernest Hemingway, Nathaniel West, William Faulkner and F. Scott 
Fitzgerald patronized Musso and Frank's Grill, 6667 Hollywood Blvd. They also 
frequented the bookstore across the street. 
</P>
<P>
* Rudolph Valentino, Gloria Swanson and Joan Crawford often visited the 
Hollywood Wax Museum building, 6767 Hollywood Blvd., when it was a swanky 
nightclub where Bing Crosby had his Los Angeles debut. 
</P>
<P>
* Ronald Reagan and Mickey Rooney were roommates at the Montecito Apartments, 
north on Cherokee Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I love pointing out things that surprise people, especially if they've lived 
here for a long time," Daugherty said. The $6 tours leave from the Capitol 
Records building each hour from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.

WOO SAYS AGREEMENT ON PARKLAND IS NEAR; 
</P>
<P>
FRYMAN CANYON: THE COUNCILMAN AND THE HEAD OF THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS 
CONSERVANCY SAY TALKS CONCERNING THE PURCHASE OF THE 63-ACRE CANYON ARE 
PROGRESSING. THE SALE WOULD END DEVELOPER'S PLANS TO BUILD HOMES THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An agreement was reported to be near last week that would end the controversy 
over development in Studio City's Fryman Canyon by turning the canyon into 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo and the head of the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, a state park agency, said long-stalled talks with a 
luxury home developer to buy the canyon from him for a park now are progressing 
favorably. 
</P>
<P>
Public agencies, led by the conservancy, are very close to an agreement to buy 
the entire 63-acre canyon, Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Purchase of the tract, just north of Mulholland Drive and west of Laurel Canyon 
Boulevard, would end the developer's plan to build houses there, which is 
intensely opposed by neighbors and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the state attorney general's office warned that it 
may sue the city for failing to secure half the canyon for park use four years 
ago. In a letter to the Los Angeles City Council received Wednesday, the 
attorney general's office warned that the state is considering a lawsuit 
against the city to secure 31 acres of the canyon for the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy had been promised that the developer would donate the land to 
the state in return for city permits, but the city issued the permits even 
though the donation was never made, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Sales negotiations between the conservancy and developer Fred Sahadi have long 
been stalled over price. 
</P>
<P>
"The developer's come down in price in recent days, but he's still not met our 
appraisal price," conservancy President Carole Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's state appraiser has said the property is worth $8.7 million. 
But Sahadi had the land appraised at $13.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
According to a source with knowledge of the negotiations, the parties are now 
talking about a price tag of about $12 million, which would make the parcel 
among the most expensive per acre of any purchased by the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Woo said the councilman is exploring the use of city park 
funds to help the conservancy pay for the site. The conservancy cannot pay more 
than the state-appraised value. 
</P>
<P>
News of the movement in negotiations emerged after Woo persuaded the council 
Wednesday to postpone until July 25 its consideration of a plan to declare part 
of Fryman Canyon a cultural-historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
"The threat of making the site a landmark has succeeded in bringing the 
negotiations to this point," Woo said in an interview. "It's created the right 
frame of mind on the developer's part to talk," but action should be delayed 
while sales negotiations continue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the council took up the question of declaring the land a 
cultural historic landmark, which would prevent development of the property for 
up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
It also ordered city Planning Department officials to investigate how the 
department granted final approval to Sahadi's project in 1986 without first 
requiring him to deed 31 acres of the property to the conservancy. The 
conservancy maintains that the developer was required to donate the land as a 
condition for obtaining city permits. 
</P>
<P>
The 31 acres are important because Sahadi's plans call for construction of a 
temporary haul road across this land to ease the building of 28 luxury houses 
on the other 32 acres. Without the haul road, it would be difficult or 
impossible for Sahadi to develop his property. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi's attorneys have complained that state agencies have been collaborating 
to make it more difficult for Sahadi to develop the land in order to force him 
to sell to the conservancy at a lower price. City and state officials deny 
this. 
</P>
<P>
In its six-page letter, the state attorney general's office wrote that the 
"manner in which the haul road was approved was fundamentally flawed," leaving 
"the approval of the haul road's location vulnerable to legal challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi refused to discuss the negotiations with the conservancy. He called the 
attorney general's letter an exercise in "sword rattling." 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a game of intimidation from day one, and this is no different," 
he said, denying that he wrongly secured his approvals. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Stevens announced that the conservancy plans to hold a 
public meeting July 23 on the possibility of buying Fryman Canyon, at which the 
developer has been asked to offer his final price. 
</P>
<P>
"I've dragged the staff and our advisory agency and the public through this 
long enough -- now, let's have hearing and get this over with," Stevens said. 
"In my head, the 23rd is a deadline." 
</P>
<P>
The city Cultural Heritage Commission put Sahadi's grading plans on hold in 
March so it could determine if Fryman Canyon merited cultural-historic landmark 
status. 
</P>
<P>
The commission finally recommended that 31 acres of the canyon -- on which 
Sahadi had no plans to build houses anyway -- be declared a landmark, citing 
the unique natural features of the area, including stands of oak and walnut 
trees and a stream. 
</P>
<P>
It was that recommendation that was before the council Wednesday and postponed 
until July 25.

OWNERS IN FIRE-PRONED AREAS WARNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David M. Kinchen 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month's wild fires in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and San Bernardino 
counties -- all allegedly deliberately started -- underscore the impact that 
arsonists have on the lives of many Southland residents. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mike Harris of California Fair Plan in Los Angeles, residents of 
hillside and other fire-prone areas should begin their anti-arson battle by 
monitoring all suspicious activity in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see suspicious looking people or vehicles in your neighborhood, notify 
the police immediately," Harris said. "If you see smoke or someone cooking in 
an area that is not a camp site, notify the authorities." 
</P>
<P>
Many communities in fire-prone areas have established citizen patrols, 
neighbors who volunteer one night a week to patrol their neighborhood looking 
for suspicious activity, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents can also band together with their fire and police departments and 
other community representatives to form an arson task force, keeping all groups 
apprised of various anti-arson activities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, communities can initiate arson hot lines and rewards for information 
leading to the conviction of arsonists. There is already one such hot line, 
Harris said, (800) 47ARSON, that offers a $500 reward for the arrest and 
conviction of arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
Besides patrolling the neighborhood for suspicious people, residents should 
make certain that physical conditions in the area will make it difficult to 
sustain a brush fire, according to David H. Crocker of the Western Insurance 
Information Service, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Taking steps to prevent losses in fire-prone hillside areas is better than 
collecting insurance proceeds after the loss, he said. The following 
precautions should reduce fire losses: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep the area around your house clear of brush. A state law requires that 
all flammable vegetation be removed within 30 feet of all structures. It's 
better to keep brush clear within 100 feet to create a fire break. A free 
brochure on fire-retardant plants is available from Western Insurance 
Information Service at (800) 397-1697. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establish an escape route from your house and your neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establish a "telephone tree." Collect the work phone numbers of all your 
neighbors and leave them with a neighbor who is home weekdays. In the event of 
fire, this neighbor can alert everyone at work. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you have a wood shake or shingle roof, consider installing a roof 
watering system. Soakers and flooders are better than sprinkler-type systems. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Better yet, replace a wooden roof with a tile or composition roof that 
won't readily support combustion of wind-driven embers. Many communities ban 
wood roofs on new houses, but don't require owners of existing homes to install 
fire-resistant roofs. David M. Kinchen

QUAKE VALVE REDUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Ralph Cohen's letter (July 8) in response to my article "Gas Shut-off 
Valve Reduces Fire Risk After Major Quake." (June 24). 
</P>
<P>
I disagree with Ralph Cohen's (spokesman for the Southern California Gas Co.) 
point that automatic shut-off valves are unnecessary because strapping a home's 
gas water heater provides ample earthquake gas fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
If fires from gas leaks are so minimal, why does the Gas Co. recommend that we 
all know how to shut the gas off at the meter with a wrench? 
</P>
<P>
As we all witnessed via television from the San Francisco Marina District 
following last year's earthquake and from Whittier following the Oct. 1, 1987 
quake, gas fires are not unusual after a temblor. 
</P>
<P>
While the proportion of homes lost to gas fires in the relatively small, and 
the earthquakes we have had may not be huge, quake experts are warning us that 
we are due for a temblor of 8.3 or greater, perhaps within 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
It does not seem unreasonable to conclude that damage to gas lines and 
appliances resulting in catastrophic fires will be much more widespread 
following a quake many times more powerful than we have experienced since 1906. 
</P>
<P>
While strapping a water heater is not a bad idea, it does not assure complete 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Following the 1987 Whittier quake, many strapped water heaters pulled loose 
from their anchor points because they were not properly secured or because the 
wall they were attached to simply collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The tank must be strapped with heavy-duty plumber's steel tape secured with 
bolts at least 2 1/2 inches in length driven into the wall studs. 
</P>
<P>
Although I do agree that falling water heaters present a serious gas earthquake 
hazard, by no means are they the only household hazard. For example, following 
the July 21, 1957 Arvin-Tehachapi earthquake in Kern County, one man was killed 
in his home when a stove exploded after gas escaping from its 
earthquake-damaged supply line ignited. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the L.A. County Fire Department reports that one garage fire was ignited 
during the 1987 Whittier quake when fumes from a knocked-over gas can were 
ignited by a water heater pilot flame. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen also makes the point that if homes are left without gas for heating or 
cooking after a major quake while residents await restoration of gas service 
when the valves shut, that it ". . . could impair the health of infants, the 
elderly, the infirm and others. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
During every other major disaster we have faced in this country, temporary 
shelter has been provided for those made homeless or displaced. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Gas Co. and other public safety officials have long 
been giving us mixed messages about safety during an earthquake. On one hand 
they advise manually shutting off the gas at the meter (we have all received 
instruction cards with our gas bills) if leaking gas is detected, while on the 
other hand, they suggest not going outside during a quake to avoid being hit by 
falling objects! 
</P>
<P>
Gas leaking in a confined space can create an explosion hazard very rapidly. If 
we are to wait for the shaking to stop before going outside to shut off the 
gas, it could be too late as shaking during a major quake can go on a long 
time. For example, during the 1964 Alaska quake, the ground shook for almost 
four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
An automatic valve is a practical answer to this dilemma.

12 COUNTIES ALLOW 'OVER 55' TAX TRANSFERS; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION 90: SOME OF STATE'S MOST POPULAR RETIREMENT AREAS HAVE VOTED NOT TO 
ACCEPT INTER-COUNTY TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY TAX VALUES FOR HOMEOWNERS 55 OR 
OLDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve of California's 58 counties have implemented the provisions of 
Proposition 90, that allow inter-county transfers of Proposition 13 base-year 
property tax values for homeowners 55 or older. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two counties -- including such popular retirement destinations as San 
Luis Obispo, Placer and Nevada -- have voted not to accept such values, which 
preserve Proposition 13 tax savings for those who owned houses at the time the 
property tax limiting measure was approved by the electorate more than a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 24 counties -- including San Francisco -- have neither 
implemented Proposition 90 nor rejected its implementation, according to a 
Sacramento spokesman for the measure's author, Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-Long 
Beach). There is no time limit on implementing the measure, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Approved by the state's voters in November, 1988, Proposition 90 was written so 
that it allowed county supervisors the options of accepting inter-county 
transfers, rejecting them or taking no action, according to the local 
government relations committee of the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 60, approved by the voters in November, 1986, allows homeowners 55 
or older to transfer the Proposition 13 base-year value of their principal 
dwelling to a replacement dwelling, provided that their new house is located in 
the same county and was of equal or less value than their former residence, 
according to a committee spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"Equal or lesser value" means that the cost of the replacement home cannot 
exceed 105% of the sales price of the old home, or 110% if purchased or built 
within two years of the sale of the old home, the CAR spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
In order to qualify for an inter-county base-year transfer, the replacement 
dwelling must have been purchased on or after the specific date which the 
receiving county has designated as the effective date for that county. 
</P>
<P>
The first table consists of counties, listed alphabetically, that will accept 
inter-county transfers on or after the effective date listed. The second table 
lists the counties that have decided not to accept inter-county transfers.

SALES: LIKE THE HOUSE? BUY IT FOR $3.8 MILLION AND ONE AGENT WILL THROW IN A

Hey buddy, want a free Rolls-Royce? 
</P>
<P>
All you do, see, is buy this mansion in Brentwood: brand new, pool, spa, sauna, 
stupendous views, five bedrooms, seven baths, maid's quarters, three-quarters 
of an acre. 
</P>
<P>
Just $3.8 million, $1.1 million off the original asking price. We'll also throw 
in a convertible 1990 Corniche III at no extra charge. 
</P>
<P>
That deal, outlined this month in a Hollywood Reporter advertisement, is an 
extreme example of a host of home-sales gimmicks in expensive California areas, 
where reality has hit realty after a remarkable boom in sales and prices in the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never seen as many incentives as now," said Mike Silverman, a veteran 
Beverly Hills broker who has sold houses for celebrities such as Judy Garland 
and Pia Zadora. 
</P>
<P>
"All the brokers are scratching their heads. Everyone has been spoiled by all 
of these good years." 
</P>
<P>
During 1988 and much of 1989, home prices soared at a clip of more than 20% per 
year in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange County, Ventura and Santa Barbara. 
In many cases, all a broker had to do was list a house to sell it, usually at a 
premium price. 
</P>
<P>
Now, despite booming price increases in cheaper inland areas, the median price 
of a California home actually fell to $197,107 in April 1990 from $201,034 in 
April 1989, according to the California Association of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
There's a glut of homes on the market, too. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, the realtors' group said 13,561 homes were for sale 
in May, a 56% jump from last year. The average sales price was $306,400, but 
only the under-$300,000 market was still hot, the trade group said. 
</P>
<P>
No one has suggested that residential property values will plummet as they have 
in the Northeast recently or the oil states a few years back. But observers 
such as Norman Katz, a thrift consultant with Grant Thornton's MCS Associates, 
believe home prices might fall 15% below their peak. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the slowdown, developers have been cutting prices. They're also 
paying closing costs, picking up months of house payments, or offering 
"trade-in" programs to help sell a buyer's old home. 
</P>
<P>
Some buyers are even getting free vacations, fully furnished homes or upgrades. 
Brokers who list expensive properties for sale are offering luxury cars and 
$10,000 bonuses to agents who close deals. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives aside, many experts say now is a good time to buy a home. 
California's economy remains strong and housing prices are poised to rebound 
since builders are starting fewer projects, lessening the risk of an 
oversupply. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, the biggest job is getting would-be buyers through the front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ellis, the broker who's giving away the Rolls with his five-bedroom 
mansion, said lowering the price didn't seem to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the idea of the Rolls will get somebody else up here. I just want to get 
my money out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said he began building that home for his family five years ago, but 
hassles with the city over its construction delayed it so long that his twin 
daughters are nearly college age. Now, $3.5 million later, his 
7,000-square-foot dream home is too big for just a couple, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said his Rolls-Royce gimmick has generated no serious offers so far. 
</P>
<P>
But Silverman, the Beverly Hills broker, said he's been able to peddle luxury 
homes by offering offbeat perks. 
</P>
<P>
He'll fly buyers around in helicopters, cater meals and pay round-trip tabs to 
New York and Hawaii to sell homes. He gift-wrapped one house, and swears 
another sold when a hungry buyer went to an open house because it had a free 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives a little pizazz to the promotion," Silverman said. "I read an ad that 
said: 'For sale. Important fish tank. Included with the fish tank is a 
three-bedroom house.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's like when you get junk mail. Some people put some really extraordinary 
copy on there that will make you open it." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is a fan of such pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
"The best incentive is to price the house right," said Fred Sands, the founder 
of California's largest one-owner real estate brokerage. "For a while there, 
you could price a house 30% over market value, and in six months prices would 
catch up. You can't do that now." 
</P>
<P>
Sands said he discourages most incentives. 
</P>
<P>
"Gimmicks are gimmicks. They're mainly to make the sellers feel good," he said. 
"The biggest incentive is to drop the price." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times it just makes people suspicious," Kay Pick, a Silverman agent, 
said of incentives. "They figure there must be something not quite right about 
the deal." 
</P>
<P>
Sands agent Thelma Orloff, who has sold luxury homes in Los Angeles for 
decades, said promotional deals are nothing new, but they've picked up recently 
as the market has cooled. Even Rolls-Royce giveaways were tried before, with 
varying degrees of success, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Orloff said one popular gimmick these days is offering already furnished 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I have sold three big houses, around $6 million each, with them furnished," 
she said. "Of course you've got to like the furniture before you'll buy the 
house. But a lot of people don't want the hassle, they want instant house: Just 
add people."

USC TO LAUNCH PUBLIC ART PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"All it takes to be an art consultant is a business card," complained Jay S. 
Willis, artist and art instructor at USC's School of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, very few consultants, city officials, developers or artists are 
prepared to establish successful public art programs, Willis said. That's why 
he and a group of others at USC are organizing an international conference on 
art in public places for next spring and a full-fledged master's degree program 
also set to begin next year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lack of leadership," Willis said. He aims to start changing 
that with a curriculum that will include studies in art history, 
administration, marketing, architecture, urban affairs and, of course, fine 
art. The National Endowment for the Arts has already committed itself to 
between $25,000 and $35,000 for a conference. Meanwhile, Willis and others at 
USC are exploring ways to get their concept going. 
</P>
<P>
There's lots to be learned both from cities that have succeeded and ones that 
have failed in their public art programs, Willis said. And, he added, by 
opening up the lines of communication between artists and others involved in 
public art, perhaps a vision for a better Los Angeles will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, artists and architects are at an unspoken war with each other. They 
need to establish a dialogue," Willis said, adding that consultants who sell 
their work must also be educated about public art. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, USC hopes to formulate a field of study that graduates students 
who can problem-solve, advise and create from an informed and enlightened 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Most pieces were designed without any concern for the environment," Willis 
lamented. "A lot of city administrators don't know what they're doing. . . . 
The public has to be educated." 
</P>
<P>
People in the art world are also afraid to make judgments about what is and is 
not appropriate for public art, Willis charged. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is making critical decisions," he said. "Everyone wants to be a 
liberal. . . . They don't want to stop and make a value judgment." But, "if a 
building has to be built, why not strive to make it more than just a box?" 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, artists and architects need to accept certain limitations and 
work creatively with them, Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
Most public art projects, for example, must be designed to avoid personal 
injury lawsuits, vandals and natural elements. Some artists consider such 
limits an affront to their sensibilities, Willis noted, rather than merely a 
challenge that has to be met. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is teaching artists and architects to sit together and speak a common 
language," added Ann Swartzberg, development director at USC School of Fine 
Arts. The results, she said, have been a "real hodgepodge." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a niche out there that nobody's really filling," she said. "There's an 
enormous gap, . . . and the university is the place to fill it." 
</P>
<P>
Just what practical results USC's foray into public art studies will yield has 
yet to be nailed down. At least, "the program will prepare people to talk to 
each other," Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
As for further advice on how to implement a citywide program in Los Angeles, he 
replied: "Ask me in five years."

SMALL INVESTOR: BUY INCOME PROPERTY BASED ON CURRENT INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We want to buy a small apartment building where we will live in the 
manager's apartment and rent the remainder of the property to tenants. However, 
the apartment buildings we have been shown by realtors all have income-expense 
statements with projected income. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to us we should buy based on the current rather than projected income. 
But the agents try to get prices based on future income. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: I think you are right and the agents are wrong. Always buy income 
property, such as apartments, based on current rather than projected income. 
The reason is that to attain the projected rents, you will have turn over 
vacancies which will necessitate repairs to possibly attain the projected 
rents. 
</P>
<P>
If you are going to incur the renovation costs it is you, not the seller, who 
should reap the benefits. Make your purchase offer based on current, not 
projected, net income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Realty Investment Causes Heavy Loss 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several years ago, I was conned by a real estate agent into buying a 
warehouse leased to a major discount store chain for 22 years. I thought it 
would be a great investment. Based on the rental income and the expense 
payments, I was earning about 10% on my money with a net, net, net lease. 
</P>
<P>
Then the discount chain got mixed up in a leveraged buyout, the company went 
bankrupt and they moved out of my warehouse. That was almost two years ago. 
Since then I have hired several realty agents trying to rent my warehouse for 
enough to cover my expenses, but I've learned the discount chain was paying 
above-market rent. The insurance company that holds the mortgage has started 
foreclosure. If I sell the warehouse at a loss before the foreclosure sale, can 
I deduct the loss on my tax returns? 
</P>
<P>
A: Please consult your tax adviser. Losses on the sale of property held for use 
in a trade or business can be tax-deductible as an ordinary loss. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was nothing inherently wrong with your investment in that 
warehouse, now you know dependence on one tenant can be very risky, especially 
if that tenant is paying above-market rent. Triple net leases, where the tenant 
pays the maintenance, taxes and insurance, can be very advantageous for 
commercial property owners, unless something goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trading Equity for Like-Kind Exchange 
</P>
<P>
Q: Years ago, I invested in an apartment building. Today I have at least 
$400,000 equity and profit in it. 
</P>
<P>
I was hoping the capital gains tax law would pass, but those characters in 
Congress don't know what's good for the country, and it looks like they may 
never enact a capital gains law to encourage investment. Some time ago, you 
wrote about tax-deferred exchanges. Is there any way I can trade my equity in 
my apartments for a nice house without having to pay tax? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. But to qualify for an Internal Revenue Code 1031 tax-deferred "like 
kind" exchange, both properties must be held for investment or used in a trade 
or business. In addition, you must trade up to a larger property without 
receiving any taxable unlike kind property "boot," such as cash or net mortgage 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
Let me illustrate. Suppose your apartments are worth $600,000 with a $200,000 
mortgage and $400,000 in equity. You can make a tax-deferred trade for a rental 
house costing at least $600,000, if it has a mortgage of at least $200,000. 
However, it must be rented to tenants to qualify as like kind property held for 
investment or use in a trade or business. 
</P>
<P>
But IRC 1031 does not say how long the house must be rented before you could 
convert it to your personal residence. No tax would be due upon such 
conversion. Most tax advisers suggest at least a 6-12-month minimum rental 
period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Second Mortgage Be Used for Business? 
</P>
<P>
Q: The new tax laws regarding deductibility of home mortgage interest seem very 
unfair. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I have a large equity in our home. But my business can use capital 
for expansion. However, under the new law we can only deduct the interest on a 
$100,000 home equity loan which we have already obtained. But my lawyer says I 
can refinance my house and deduct the mortgage interest as a business expense 
if I put the extra cash into my business. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: I agree that the new home mortgage interest deduction rules are very unfair, 
especially for homeowners who had large equities when the law was implemented 
on Oct. 13, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, you should be able to deduct the interest on a home loan used for business 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
However, be very careful to show the funds were used in your business. As your 
lawyer advised, although the security for the loan is your home, if the purpose 
is a business loan, then the interest becomes deductible as a business expense 
on your business tax return. Ask your tax adviser to explain further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Estate Income Can Be Depreciated 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last year my father died and I inherited a life estate in some income 
properties he owned. When I die, the properties are to go to my children. 
</P>
<P>
They are free and clear, producing excellent income. Can I depreciate these 
properties on my income tax returns? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. In fact, Uncle Sam says you must depreciate them. Internal Revenue Code 
167(h) says a life tenant can depreciate life estate property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remove Tenants Before Marketing a House 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have had a house listed for sale since last October. It hasn't had one 
offer. The realtor, who I think is doing a good job, says the tenants are 
discouraging sale of the house. She wants me to evict them. But I hate to lose 
the rent income and I know the house will then have to be repainted and 
recarpeted. Do you think I should evict the tenants? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Selling a home with tenants occupying it is extremely difficult. Real 
estate agents hesitate to show such houses, knowing the tenants will usually 
emphasize any defects to prospective buyers because the tenants don't want to 
see the house sold since they know they will probably have to move out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Is Depreciation on Income Property? 
</P>
<P>
Q: You often mention depreciation as an advantage of owning income property. 
Please clarify exactly what is depreciation and how does it benefit property 
investors? 
</P>
<P>
A: Depreciation is a non-cash estimated income tax deduction for wear, tear and 
obsolescence of depreciable property such as apartments, offices, rental houses 
and warehouses. But land value and personal residences are not depreciable. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose you buy a $150,000 rental house to which you allocate 
$100,000 for the value of the depreciable structure. Using the current 
27.5-year straight-line residential rental depreciation useful life, you can 
deduct $3,680 annually for the next 27.5 years. Commercial buildings are 
depreciated over 31.5 years. The net result is each year you would shelter 
$3,680 of otherwise taxable income, such as rent earned by the property, from 
taxation.

SEALING PINE CURBS KNOT BLEEDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I have built-in corner cabinets in my dining room that I painted to 
match the room trim. The cabinet doors are pine, and after two years, the knots 
are bleeding through and looking really bad. The doors now have four coats of 
paint but it doesn't stop the bleeding. Is there an easy way to seal these 
knots to prevent this from happening again when I repaint the doors? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Probably your cabinet doors were not primed and sealed prior to the 
original painting. The Parks Corp. of Somerset, Mass., has a product called 
UnderCover, which they claim will keep wood-knot and sap stains sealed beneath 
its prime undercoat. UnderCover is available in paint stores and costs about 
$20 a gallon. Don't add a fifth coat of paint to the cabinet doors. Strip off 
the four coats now on the doors and sand all the rough areas for a smooth, 
clean surface. Apply the UnderCover primer paint, let it dry thoroughly and 
then repaint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shower Diverter Valve Is Easy to Fix, Replace 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a problem with the shower diverter on my bathtub faucet. When the 
knob is pulled up to divert water to the shower, a lot of water continues to 
flow into the tub. Is there any way either to replace or repair this fixture 
without having to open up the wall? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The diverter valve mechanism you refer to is inside the tub faucet 
spout, not inside the wall. The spout is screwed onto the water pipe and can be 
unscrewed easily. Once the spout is off, you can see the mechanism. It's a 
small gate valve on the base of the plunger shaft. Water pressure holds it up 
(closed position). Turn off the water and the gate valve drops, opening the tub 
spout so water flows into the tub next time it's turned on. 
</P>
<P>
If the diverter can't be repaired, it's cheap and easy enough to replace the 
entire spout, including the diverter mechanism. These spouts are available at 
plumbing supply stores and home centers and usually cost between $10 and $15. 
</P>
<P>
There are different types and sizes of diverter spouts available, so take your 
old spout along to make sure you get the right one. Check especially that the 
setback distance of the threads within the spout matches the length of the 
protruding water pipe, so that you get a tight fit between the spout shoulder 
and the wall. 
</P>
<P>
When replacing the spout, use pipe-joint compound or Teflon sealing tape on the 
threads to prevent leaks. Completely fill the hollowed-out back end of the 
spout with plumber's putty to keep water from getting in behind it and 
penetrating the wall.

HEATING, ROOFING WOES ARE THE MOST COMMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, we described some of the most common house problems found by a 
licensed professional engineer specializing in home inspections. Here are some 
additional possible trouble spots every homeowner or prospective buyer should 
be aware of: 
</P>
<P>
Most modern homes are heated by warm air, hot water or steam through oil- or 
gas-fired furnaces or boilers. Nearly 42% of the inspections turned up an aging 
or obsolete boiler or furnace as well as malfunctioning or missing controls 
such as low-water cutoff, high pressure or temperature limit switch, fan 
control, relief valve, oil burner, gas valve, zone valves or circulating pumps. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40% of the homes had deteriorated roofing. Most pitched roofs in the 
U.S. are covered with asphalt shingles that have a projected life of 17 to 22 
years. As shingles age and weather, they begin to curl, lift, lose their 
granular coating, develop hairline cracks in the surface and erode in the slots 
between the shingle tabs. As they dry, they also become vulnerable to wind 
damage and can be blown off in a storm. Severely cracked or deteriorated 
shingles should be replaced as needed, but it is not usually necessary to 
reroof because a few shingles are bad. 
</P>
<P>
Missing or damaged gutters and downspouts appeared on 34% of the houses 
inspected. Even houses with these items in good condition could benefit from 
cleaning them out or improving their layout. Gutters and downspouts control 
rain runoff from the roof, yet sagging, missing, leaking or clogged sections 
can cause problems ranging from basement flooding to structural rot. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally downspouts are connected improperly. The lower sections must be 
set outside the upper ones, otherwise water can leak through the joints. 
</P>
<P>
Fire safety hazards should be checked or corrected. About 30% of the homes had 
one or more potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
All houses should have a smoke detector mounted on the ceiling in the hallway 
near the bedrooms. Many homes also had exposed wood framing too close to the 
heating system boiler or furnace. The exposed wood should be covered with 
fire-rated gypsum board, such as type X dry wall, as a fire-safety precaution. 
This material has a one-hour fire rating. Although it will not stop a fire, 
gypsum board will prolong the time it takes before the fire makes contact with 
the wood. 
</P>
<P>
Plumbing problems afflicted some 28% of the houses checked. Plumbing includes 
the distribution piping, the waste lines and the fixtures. Deteriorated 
distribution piping is very common in older homes. Normally, these pipes are 
made of iron, brass or copper. 
</P>
<P>
Steps and stairs presented hazards in 21% of the houses inspected. When there 
are more than two risers in a set of steps, a handrail is recommended, 
especially for exterior steps subject to freezing rain in winter. Uneven risers 
(vertical distance between steps) present a tripping hazard. Indoors, attic or 
basement stairs are often missing their handrails. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a quarter of the homes checked wasted fuel with uninsulated hot-water 
systems. When the domestic hot water is produced through the heating system by 
a tank-less coil, there is often no relief valve in the piping. Both 
temperature- and pressure-sensitive relief valves are safety requirements.

REMODELER'S DIARY: A LOFTY IDEA FOR AN ADDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH McKEE, McKee who lives in Vista, is working on a book How to Buy a 
Tract Home. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who are these people writing to the Real Estate section about their remodeling 
nightmares? I don't know anyone who can go 100% over their $100,000-plus 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
When remodelers start writing about adding another $200,000 to their modest 
little homes, well, as Roseanne Barr would say, "It makes me want to puke." 
Time for a reality check. 
</P>
<P>
Now that I've gotten the hostility and envy out of my system, I can write about 
our true-to-life remodel. The total cost will be under $1,500 and will add 
about 100 square feet of space to our 1,550-square-foot tract house. 
</P>
<P>
We're adding a loft that will serve as a library, computer room, place for a 
second television and home-work/project area. 
</P>
<P>
As with most families with children (other than families of doctors, lawyers 
and movie chiefs), our house is not palatial. Fifteen hundred square feet is 
entirely adequate compared to what most of the inhabitants of this planet have 
to live in. 
</P>
<P>
People who are miserable because they can't have that fourth bedroom or a 
three-car garage have delusions of poverty that are making them miserable. But 
then, everyone wants more space. It's the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
The American dream has a different price tag depending on whether you do the 
work yourself or pay someone else for labor. Our remodeling costs are limited 
to materials. The rough lumber was $300; finish lumber and moldings, extra 
wire, electrical outlets and light fixtures, $125; hand rail, $250; 
parquet-wood floor, $300, and $75 for paint. We are not sure of the cost of the 
office furniture yet. We might build the desks ourselves, using file cabinets 
for support, with white Formica top work areas. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of labor is more difficult to figure since the work was going on at 
night and on weekends. My husband, Morris, figures that he worked at least 80 
hours. Contractors would charge around $40 per hour, which would amount to 
$3,200 in wages. Most contractors would not do the job for just labor and 
materials, though. They would charge at least $5,000 for the job, since it is 
so small. 
</P>
<P>
The total for the materials, $1,300, combined with the $3,200 hourly wages adds 
up to $4,450 as a starting figure. It is impossible to suggest the cost of 
other loft additions, since each living room is built differently and would 
require different sizes of wood to be structurally sound. Most people would 
want someone good with design and construction to help them figure out how to 
integrate and build a loft into their high-ceilinged living space. 
</P>
<P>
Our living room had an existing "plant-shelf." To make our loft, all we had to 
do was expand this useless space and provide access to it without going through 
another room. Other houses might require a complete balcony structure across 
the living room to gain a loft. The materials needed to build such a balcony 
would, of course, be more expensive, since a greater span would require more 
rough lumber. 
</P>
<P>
Adding a loft to most homes would cost much more than $1,000, but because it 
was a do-it-yourself project for us, we kept the costs down. Other than the 
drywall texture and wrought-iron railing welding, we did all the work 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
I say "we," even though my husband gets all the credit for building the loft. 
But our two boys and I were involved and affected by the construction project. 
You cannot live in a torn-up house and not be impacted. The dust and noise 
alone is baptism by fire. It affects you even when you insist that it won't. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the only thing not completed on the remodel is a little paint 
and the flooring. The building of the bookcases and the work areas don't really 
count because life can be somewhat normal with that project going on. Normal to 
me means that the drop-cloths are gone, the furniture is back in place, and the 
need to dust and vacuum goes back to once or twice a week instead of hourly. 
</P>
<P>
Why did we decide to go through the hell of remodeling? 
</P>
<P>
We coveted the unused space above the high vaulted ceiling in our living and 
dining rooms. With a loft workroom, we wouldn't have to clear the school 
projects off the dining room table when it was time to eat. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a bad idea to have to walk through one room to get to another, and we 
wondered how we could utilize the loft without having to cut a door in the 
upstairs master-bedroom to get to it. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Morris came home and said he had figured out a solution to the loft 
access problem. 
</P>
<P>
His idea also would solve the bookcase shortage in our house. It called for a 
stretch of wall, 15 feet long, that would be floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. 
Since every available flat surface of our house is covered with books, and 
library books end up in stacks on the floor, the idea of extensive bookshelves 
was appealing. I would get to have more books, and Morris would have a cleaner, 
less cluttered house. 
</P>
<P>
The plan called for taking out the laundry closet at the second-floor landing 
that was just to the left of the open stairwell. The laundry closet could 
easily be relocated and an open walkway would be constructed that hugged the 
wall and wrapped its way around to the living room and eventually to a loft 
over the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
The new second-story hallway would have floor-to-ceiling bookcases. Two work 
stations and a computer setup were to be nestled in the loft. Total square 
footage gained would be the 3-by-15-foot hall and the 5-by-18-foot loft, 
equaling 135 square feet of extra living space in our three-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
Morris promised that the work would be done in 30 days. He would have kept to 
the time limit too, but we decided to repaint the living room and put 
better-quality moldings around the doors. 
</P>
<P>
I am writing this so that other "regular folks" (i.e., not rich) might be 
inclined to add a loft in their unused vaulted-ceiling areas that are common to 
homes built in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
There is another reason, too. People are less inclined to move if they have a 
remodeling option. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 homes in our 3-year-old cul-de-sac in north San Diego County, only 
four are still owned by the original buyers. Most of the neighbors "took the 
money and ran" because of the rapid growth in equity. These were modest homes, 
and people wanted to trade up to bigger homes. 
</P>
<P>
Now the market has slowed down and people cannot move around as easily. A 
solution to a too-small house is to find some space inside and use it more 
efficiently. Changing a roof or a foundation is usually too expensive to be 
undertaken lightly. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the financial stress inherent in remodeling, the emotional 
stresses cannot be underestimated. I would rather remodel than have to move, 
but I haven't lived through a kitchen remodel. That might be as much of a 
nightmare as moving. 
</P>
<P>
One way we tried to lessen the stress was by having a deadline of six weeks. 
Time and money can dribble by endlessly if limits are not set. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the project, two conflicting emotions seem to set in: 
lethargy and elation. "Almost done" means less mess, but it also means that the 
motivation to finish the job sometimes needs an extra nudge. Motivation may be 
provided by planning a party to show off the remodel. It is amazing how willing 
the family is to put in late nights working on the job if they know that 50 
friends are coming over to look at the project next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Deadlines help get things done, especially remodeling jobs. Otherwise, 
remodeling can be endless. What a purgatory. Living in an unfinished house, 
forever. But remember the Winchester widow who believed that as long as she was 
remodeling her house she would live forever? 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I feel as if our marriage thrives on one or two well-conceived 
building projects a year. We have had the exciting planning stage, the stress 
of the working stage and the elation of the finished stage many times in our 
14-year marriage. So far, it's worked for us. 
</P>
<P>
I would not recommend remodeling projects to anyone with a crummy relationship, 
though. It's similar to having kids to save a shaky marriage. What a disaster. 
But if the marriage is good, it's unrelenting work, anyway. extra wire, 
electrical outlets and light fixtures, $125; hand rail, $250; parquet-wood 
floor, $300, and $75 for paint. We are not sure of the cost of the office 
furniture yet.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT: CENTER SPEAKER IS LAST WORD IN SOUND SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY SOMERFIELD, Somerfield is a home entertainment columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this day of stereo everything, why would anyone want to buy just one 
speaker? Perhaps you'd rather concentrate on Paul and John, ignoring George and 
Ringo. Then again, maybe you've been contemplating adding a center-front 
speaker to your surround-sound system. 
</P>
<P>
A center-front channel adds a great deal to the enjoyment of 
surround-sound-encoded movies. The addition of a center-front channel means 
that the dialogue will be "locked on" to the screen, no matter where a viewer 
sits in the room. In addition to dialogue, today's movie soundtracks use the 
center-front channel for explosive sound effects and drama-enhancing music. 
With all this work to do, quality is important -- you shouldn't use just any 
old speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, most high-quality speakers are sold only in pairs. To get the 
speaker you want, it may be necessary to find a friend who also needs a single 
speaker, and buy a pair to share -- or, buy a pair, and leave those unused 
dollars languishing in a box on a shelf in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaha, responding to the plight of surround-sound enthusiasts, is offering a 
high-quality speaker designed specifically for use at the center-front 
position. 
</P>
<P>
The new speaker, designated as the NS-C70, is magnetically shielded so it can 
sit directly on top of or underneath a television set without interfering with 
the picture quality. (Speakers use magnets to move their cones, and so to 
reproduce sound. Unshielded magnets can cause bizarre changes on the face of a 
TV's picture tube, including color disturbances and the distortion of on-screen 
objects.) 
</P>
<P>
The Yamaha NS-C70 is long and low, not your typically rectangular speaker. Its 
dimensions are 17.5 inches wide by 5.35 inches tall by 6.25 inches deep. The 
face of the speaker is slanted at a 15-degree angle, so depending on which side 
you place up, the sound can be directed down from the top of a TV or up from 
under the TV screen. Because of its shape, this speaker would also be at home 
mounted on the ceiling or floor. 
</P>
<P>
The speaker contains two 4-inch, full-range drivers. It is rated at 6 ohms, 
with a frequency response of 70 to 20,000 Hz. The NS-C70 is finished in black, 
with a black grill cloth. Its suggested retail price is $119. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Camcorder Kit 
</P>
<P>
If you own a full-size VHS camcorder, let me introduce you to the Scotch brand 
camcorder kit, from the 3M Company. All in one box you'll find: a head-cleaning 
tape, a Pro/Camera T-120 blank videocassette tape, a roll of Re-Label tape (for 
marking cassettes) and a cleaning kit for camera lenses. The lens-cleaning kit 
includes, in its own clear plastic box, a brush with a built-in squeeze bulb to 
blow dust away, a package of lens-cleaning tissue and a one-ounce bottle of 
special, lens-cleaning fluid. You'll find the Scotch camcorder care kit (for 
full-size VHS camcorders only) in most stores that sell videotape. It lists for 
under $30. 
</P>
<P>
Laser Video Discs 
</P>
<P>
Laser Video File is the name of a catalogue that announces it offers "The 
Complete List of Laser Video Discs, Over 4,000 titles in all!" Without 
counting, I must assume the title is accurate. At any rate, this little 5- by 
8-inch paperback book contains 240 pages jammed with titles of movies, music 
videos, and material catering to special interests. 
</P>
<P>
Each page holds 18 listings. The listings include a postage-stamp-size black 
and white photo of the disc's jacket, a short description of the program, the 
name of its current distributor and the year of release. A coded panel gives 
the following information: catalogue number, sound (mono, stereo, digital, 
etc.), indication if the soundtrack is CX encoded, color or black and white, 
CAV or CLV, its theatrical rating (PG, R, etc.), running time in minutes, 
number of sides, and suggested retail price. 
</P>
<P>
Laser Video File (Vol. 2, No. 1 is the current issue) includes 12-inch, 8-inch 
and 5-inch (CDV) disc titles. Its cover lists a suggested retail price of 
$3.50, though I'm sure many laser-disc stores will be happy to give you one 
with your next laser videodisc purchase. Laser Video File is produced by New 
Visions Inc. and Pioneer LDCA. For the name of a dealer near you who carries 
it, write to P.O. Box 828, Westwood, NJ 07675; telephone number is (201) 
712-9500.

NEC Folds Its Tent 
</P>
<P>
Last month, NEC announced it was getting out of the home entertainment 
equipment business in the United States. All that will remain are the computer 
and video game divisions. 
</P>
<P>
I found it hard to believe, but I guess it's true. I suppose they weren't 
making enough money; but that surprises me, because their product line of TVs, 
VCRs and audio equipment was excellent. In fact, I was eagerly anticipating the 
arrival of several of their recently announced units, especially a hot new 
audio/video switcher. 
</P>
<P>
With quite a few manufacturers out there producing goods of marginal quality, 
it's sad to see a really good one go away. Those of you who own NEC products, 
don't worry, NEC will maintain its parts/service network for some time to come. 
For those of you who were considering the purchase of NEC products before you 
read this, I'd buy what I could of whatever products are still on the shelves. 
When those units are gone, there won't be any more.

SHE'S PLAGUED BY PAIN -- AND WANTS ANSWERS; 
</P>
<P>
DISABILITY: CECILE GRACY TOOK L-TRYPTOPHAN TO IMPROVE HER HEALTH BEFORE HER 
WEDDING. SHE CLAIMS A BAD BATCH OF IT HAS RUINED HER LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last July, Cecile Gracy was an excited Burbank bride-to-be who vowed to get in 
shape before her September wedding. So she began exercising, dieting and taking 
a health supplement called L-tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Gracy had taken the over-the-counter product in 1984 after her doctor 
recommended it for sleeping difficulties and cramps. The tryptophan proved so 
effective that she figured it would help her become a healthy, fit bride. 
</P>
<P>
"What had been good for me before is going to be good for me now," Gracy 
recalled saying last year. Though tryptophan is not normally prescribed for 
fitness or dieting, she had come to regard the supplement as a harmless 
vitamin. "I wanted to clean up my act, and this supplement was kind of like 
extra protection and support." 
</P>
<P>
One year later, 31-year-old Cecile Gracy is disabled. She cannot walk without a 
cane and has difficulty breathing. She feels pain in her muscles when her new 
husband tries to hug her. She cannot remember much of what she reads or hears. 
And she fears she will never be able to have children. 
</P>
<P>
What once cured her cramps and was expected to improve her health, her doctors 
say, is precisely what disabled her: the supplement L-tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Cecile and her husband filed a $30-million lawsuit in Burbank 
Superior Court against the largest of six Japanese suppliers of tryptophan. 
They allege that Showa Denko of Tokyo produced a contaminated batch of the 
product that damaged Cecile's body. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's gone to hell," said Mike Gracy, her 27-year-old husband, in an 
interview at the couple's small Burbank apartment. "It's been almost a year and 
she's not even close to being able to function normally. They don't even know 
if she'll live past her next birthday." 
</P>
<P>
Cecile and hundreds of others nationwide were diagnosed last fall as having 
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, a mysterious ailment marked by abnormal levels 
of white blood cells called eosinophils and severe muscle pain. These cells are 
part of the body's immune system, but in this ailment abnormally large amounts 
release a toxin that attacks bodily tissues. Victims and doctors initially were 
baffled by the cause, but researchers eventually linked the syndrome to 
tryptophan. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalled the supplement in 
mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
Medical, federal and state officials say there is increasing evidence that the 
epidemic was caused by a contaminated batch of tryptophan manufactured 
specifically by Showa Denko. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the FDA nor the federal Centers for Disease Control has officially 
blamed the company, and Showa Denko has acknowledged only a "statistical 
association" between the epidemic and its product, said Bob Schwadron, a 
company spokesman. He said more research is needed to pinpoint the cause. 
</P>
<P>
But other medical researchers said they believe Showa Denko is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no evidence that it's anybody's product but Showa Denko's," said Dr. 
Michael Osterholm, a Minnesota state epidemiologist who helped author an 
upcoming New England Journal of Medicine article that details that theory. 
</P>
<P>
For Cecile and Mike Gracy, that is a partial relief. Finding a cause should 
help them seek redress, and more important, might help find a treatment or 
cure, they said. But it is the uncertainty of the future -- of whether Cecile 
will fully recover, bear children or die -- that worries the newlyweds. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing is the unknown," Mike Gracy said. "We're staring into an abyss 
and there's nothing coming back. To start a life together like that . . . it's 
not fair." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cecile, a blond-haired woman with a soft, girlish voice and face, nor 
Mike, her burly, bearded spouse, was ever athletic or particularly 
health-conscious, they said. But they loved the outdoors, often riding mountain 
bikes or going four-wheel-driving in the hills. 
</P>
<P>
Cecile Gracy diligently recorded memories of those times on a wall calendar she 
treated as a daily diary. The square for each day was filled with notes 
describing her workday and the time she shared with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Then, starting in July, "it just got filled with rotten things," such as notes 
about her deteriorating condition, she said. Shortly after she resumed taking 
tryptophan, she began getting sore throats, and her face, feet and hands 
started to swell. Soon she was having trouble breathing and was losing weight 
and hair. 
</P>
<P>
Her co-workers and friends attributed the problems to nervousness about the 
upcoming wedding; she and Mike thought it was the stress of her job, as a title 
assistant at a large Glendale real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
The Gracys were married Sept. 16, but the honeymoon was cut short because 
Cecile felt increasingly ill. In the weeks that followed, she began to feel 
pain in her muscles and to lose her memory at work. Eventually, she could 
neither urinate nor eat. But until she could no longer get the pills down her 
throat, she said, she continued taking tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the pathetic part," she said. "Every morning I'd say, 'OK, maybe today 
the tryptophan will get rid of this stress and these problems.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cecile was hospitalized in October and was routinely ordered to stop taking any 
medicines or vitamins. After three weeks of testing, her doctors knew she had 
an abnormal level of white blood cells but could not identify her illness. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peng Fan -- a Sherman Oaks rheumatologist who years earlier had recommended 
tryptophan for her cramps -- prescribed prednisone, a steroid, for reducing the 
white blood cell count, and sent her home. Weeks later, as other cases appeared 
nationwide, Fan and other doctors identified her case as being part of the 
epidemic of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, caused by tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Cecile Gracy visits a doctor and physical therapist six days a week. But 
most of her time is spent resting on the couch or sitting in a hot bath, trying 
to relax her muscles, she said. Each day, Mike Gracy rises early, helps her get 
settled for the day, and returns periodically from his job as a manager at an 
electrical supply company to check on her. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his nights and weekends are spent sifting through stacks of medical 
documents, he said, and fighting with his insurance company over its share of 
the bills -- -- which he said now might be in the six-figure range. They are 
worried that if her condition deteriorates, the demands of caring for her could 
force him to lose his job, threatening the couple's ability to pay their share 
of the medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
"She's still pretty afflicted at this time," Fan said in an interview. "She 
still is in a lot of pain from the damage done by the tryptophan. Right now, we 
really don't have any effective treatment. All we have are some medicines that 
make it more tolerable." 
</P>
<P>
The prednisone steroid, despite some side effects, has helped reduce her white 
blood cell count, Fan said. Cecile is able to move around somewhat with a cane 
and at times can accomplish household tasks, although she said her memory is 
still poor. 
</P>
<P>
Fan said Cecile actually is faring better than some of the other 
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome patients he and other Los Angeles doctors now are 
treating. Some people afflicted with the malady have died, while others have 
suffered few or no symptoms. But he said that it is impossible to predict her 
future. 
</P>
<P>
That is what frustrates and scares Cecile and Mike Gracy the most. And what 
makes them angriest at Showa Denko, the company they allege is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get married, build a house and raise a family. My biggest dream 
was to have a set of twins," said Cecile, her voice cracking. "I don't want 
vengeance. If they can come up with the chemical to reverse all this, I'd take 
that instead of any amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fair trade," she said. "Make it go away." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan is a natural amino acid contained in proteins found in meat, eggs, 
dairy products and other foods. Tryptophan supplements were widely used for a 
variety of problems, including sleeping difficulties, anxiety and premenstrual 
syndrome. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last November ordered the 
supplements recalled after they were linked to an epidemic of a blood and 
muscle ailment called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. So far, more than 1,500 
cases, including 27 deaths, have been reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control.

FERRAGAMO'S NEW BALLGAME; 
</P>
<P>
HARD-WORKING COACH SAYS FAMILY, NOT FOOTBALL, COMES FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a few fleeting weeks in the fall of 1986, Chris Ferragamo sat at the top of 
the high school football world. 
</P>
<P>
His unbeaten and untied Banning High team was ranked No. 1 in the country by 
USA Today and was on the verge of winning the mythical national title. The last 
team standing in the Pilots' way was arch-rival Carson, which Banning had 
beaten soundly, 37-10, in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our guys knew we were going to win again," Ferragamo recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the veteran coach and his players, things didn't work out 
that way. Carson knocked Banning from its pedestal with a stunning 21-11 upset 
in the L.A. City Section championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began Ferragamo's swift and long fall from the coaching limelight. 
</P>
<P>
Spurned in his attempts to land a university coaching job, he left Banning to 
become coach at Harbor College in 1987. By the end of the 1988 season, he was a 
beaten man, frustrated by a system that he was unfamiliar with and stripped of 
his once-unflinching confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was a good coach, but I guess I'm not," he said after a 20-9 loss 
to Compton College on Oct. 15, 1988. "This is really the low point of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Today, he is preparing for his second season as the offensive line coach at 
Long Beach City College. It's not where Ferragamo, who once aspired to run his 
own major-college program, would have pictured himself working a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the part-time position has provided him with an avenue to exercise his 
undying love for coaching and renew his appreciation for family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"In all my years of coaching, I never spent any time with my family," he said. 
"All my time was spent with other people's children. Now I'm getting a chance 
to spend time with my own." 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo, who turns 50 in December, recently became a grandfather for the 
first time when his daughter, Deeanna, gave birth to baby girl. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my job right now, my little granddaughter Meagan," he said. "My wife 
and I get more pleasure out of that than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean that Ferragamo is content to spend the rest of his coaching days 
toiling in the background? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really pretty happy right now," he said. "There's still a little 
competitive fire. Some day I might like to be a head coach again. Maybe some 
day. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo's competitive fires burned brightly during his 18-year reign as 
Banning's coach. After enduring some lean years, Ferragamo guided the Pilots to 
eight L.A. City titles, including an unprecedented six in a row from 1976 to 
'81. His career record was 157-36-4. 
</P>
<P>
He was the toast of Wilmington, the blue-collar city where he grew up and 
helped put on the map through Banning's successes on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when Chris could have run for mayor of Wilmington," said 
Harbor College Athletic Director Jim O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo believed that coaching a nationally recognized high school team would 
lead to a job at a university or an established community college. But he never 
got beyond an audition. Stanford, USC and El Camino College were among the 
schools that turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, what they were saying was that I didn't have enough college 
coaching experience," he said. "So I took the Harbor College job." 
</P>
<P>
Others, though, said Ferragamo's downfall was an overbearing attitude that 
turned off administrators and coaches at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
"There was definitely an arrogant side to him," said one college coach. 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo admitted that he may have come on too strong in interviews. Twice he 
applied for the head job at El Camino College, but was passed over for Jack 
Reilly in 1982 and John Featherstone in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have got the El Camino job," he said. "But I think they figured I was 
too dominant a personality. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a takeover person. If I'm in a group, I have a tendency to be the guy that 
wants to direct and organize everything. It's just inside me, that's what makes 
me go." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the issue of his ability as a coach. Despite his success at 
Banning, some questioned if Ferragamo could cut it on the college level. That 
might have been answered during his two-year stint at Harbor College, where his 
teams were a dismal 3-17-1, including 1-10 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It has led some to believe that Ferragamo excelled at Banning because he had 
great talent -- players such as Freeman McNeil, Stanley Wilson and Jamelle 
Holieway -- and not because he was great with X's and O's. 
</P>
<P>
Others voice a more sympathetic opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's unfortunate what's happened in his coaching career, because 
nobody likes to see what he's gone through," said Featherstone, coach of the 
successful El Camino program. "The coaching fraternity is a tough fraternity. 
You've got to produce and you've got to win or, unfortunately, you are looked 
upon as a loser. Chris isn't a loser. He just got caught in a tough situation 
at Harbor for a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo can handle the criticism. In evaluating his abilities, he graded 
himself as a good motivator and average tactician. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing I have going for me is that I'm a motivator," he said. "I 
would take a kid who was unmotivated and try to get him jacked up to play ball. 
That was my forte. I wasn't a great coach, but I was good doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Ferragamo has no regrets, it's clear that his descent as a coach began 
when he took over the football program at Harbor College. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks have struggled for years to compete under the long shadow of 
neighboring El Camino College, which regularly attracts the best high school 
players in the South Bay because of its winning tradition, seasoned coaching 
staff and excellent facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo, though, believed his reputation at Banning would help him draw 
top-notch players to Harbor. He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I could draw the good kids, but it was just the opposite," he said. 
"I didn't get one Banning player that first year, not one. I guess the kids 
didn't like me. It was very disillusioning." 
</P>
<P>
Banning Coach Joe Dominguez, who served under Ferragamo for 12 seasons as the 
offensive coordinator at Banning and one year at Harbor, offered another 
viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"When a kid leaves high school, he has aspirations of playing further at the 
Division I level," Dominguez said. "Those two years at a junior college are 
very important to him. He doesn't want to experiment. He wants to go to a known 
program where he's going to get exposure." 
</P>
<P>
There were other problems. Before the 1987 season, Ferragamo unknowingly 
violated a recruiting rule by sending letters to high school coaches outside of 
Harbor's district. The state placed him on probation for a year, during which 
time Harbor's recruiting was monitored. 
</P>
<P>
"It was embarrassing to our administrators," said O'Brien, the Harbor athletic 
director. "They didn't like it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor was 2-7-1 in Ferragamo's first year. It was his worst season as coach 
since Banning was 1-7 in the 1972, the year after quarterback Vince Ferragamo, 
Chris' youngest brother, graduated before going on to play for Nebraska and the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
But if Ferragamo's first year at Harbor was rough, 1988 was a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the season began with a coaching faux pas. Before Harbor played El 
Camino, Ferragamo sent an assistant coach, John Brown, to watch the Warriors 
run through an inter-squad scrimmage, a violation of scouting practices. 
</P>
<P>
When Featherstone spotted Brown taking notes in the stands at El Camino's 
Murdock Stadium, he confronted Brown, took the notebook out of his hands and 
told him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an isolated incident," Featherstone said. "I don't think Chris was 
familiar with the rules, and I don't think John Brown understood, either. They 
both apologized." 
</P>
<P>
But the incident resulted in bad publicity for Ferragamo and Harbor. And the 
publicity grew worse. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks were not merely losing, they were losing ugly. In a 47-10 defeat 
at Bakersfield College, four Harbor players were ejected for fighting and 
assistant coach Jim True, Ferragamo's right-hand man, was suspended for shoving 
a trainer over a disagreement on how to treat an injured player. 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo doesn't deny that the team had discipline problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was that I couldn't get the kids that were disciplined to come 
there," he said. "I got kids that were undisciplined. That's the only thing I 
could get. I had to play with whatever I had. If I kicked off all the kids on 
my team that were undisciplined, I wouldn't have had anybody left." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Ferragamo realizes the situation grew worse because he was an 
off-campus coach. A science teacher at Banning for 28 years, he wasn't at 
Harbor during the day to address the needs of his players. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dominguez: "If you don't get there until an hour before practice, you 
can't solve those problems." 
</P>
<P>
The failure of Harbor's program to take off under Ferragamo came as a great 
surprise and disappointment to O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
"With his attitude and charisma, I thought he would have the kids storming in," 
he said. "We had a good turnout of kids the first year, but the key was that so 
many left. It seemed like we were starting over every year." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, coach of Harbor's state champion baseball team, said Ferragamo might 
have underestimated the competitiveness of community college athletics. Or, as 
one coach put it, Ferragamo suffered from "visions of grandeur." 
</P>
<P>
Among the criticisms was that he scheduled non-conference games with teams that 
were far superior to Harbor, such as El Camino and Taft. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris came in with really big ideas," O'Brien said. "He almost talked me into 
building a bigger stadium. He had me convinced that place was going to be 
filled up. Well, if you came to our games, you know we didn't need a bigger 
stadium. Things didn't work out like he had pictured." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, though, admired Ferragamo's work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a guy who worked any harder than he did," he said. "I have 
great respect for Chris. He has a lot of energy. If he were a salesman, he 
would make a million dollars. He has that gleam in his eye." 
</P>
<P>
But the gleam turned to a glaze after two years at Harbor. After the 1988 
season, Ferragamo withdrew his name from a list of candidates who had applied 
for a temporary full-time position in the athletic department, a job earmarked 
by O'Brien for the football coach. With the job guaranteed for only a year, 
Ferragamo felt he couldn't afford to leave his teaching position at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks later, Don Weems, a former assistant coach at Santa Monica 
College and Nevada-Las Vegas, was hired as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was pleased with the way Harbor handled the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have to give a coach a certain amount of time to settle in and 
find out what needs to be done," Dominguez said. "I don't think Harbor was 
patient enough with him. Sometimes a coach tends to get blamed for things that 
are out of his control." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez pointed out that two-thirds of Ferragamo's staff left Harbor after 
the 1987 season to return to Banning, where Dominguez was chosen to replace 
John Hazelton as head coach. "I'm sure that hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ferragamo offered no excuses. 
</P>
<P>
He gave this appraisal of his experience at Harbor after Weems was named coach 
in February, 1989: "I thought it would take a year or so to build the program. 
But I realize now that it takes time. I would need about five years to do it. I 
guess I just wasn't as knowledgeable about the area and the system as I 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's loss became Long Beach's gain. 
</P>
<P>
Without a coaching job for the first time since 1963, Ferragamo got a call in 
the summer of 1989 from Long Beach City College Coach Wil Shaw, asking him to 
join the Viking staff as the offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't put any pressure on me," said Ferragamo, a former All-Marine League 
center at Banning. "Had he done that, I wouldn't be there. I found a home over 
there, a little niche." 
</P>
<P>
In his first year at Long Beach, the Vikings were 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
Some believed Ferragamo would return to Banning after leaving Harbor. But he 
has no immediate plans to return to the high school game. 
</P>
<P>
"I never regret leaving Banning," he said. "I enjoyed all my years of coaching 
there, with Dominguez and (defensive coordinator) Rocky Garibay and those guys, 
because they were great. Those are memories I cherish a lot. But the reason I 
left is because I wanted new horizons in coaching. I've been to Harbor and now 
I'm at Long Beach City. I've seen what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez said he never asked Ferragamo to join his staff at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
"I have so much respect for Chris, I feel it would have been a put-down for me 
to offer him a job," he said. "I couldn't have done that." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, however, had no qualms about asking Ferragamo to help out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping he would be receptive, and he was," said Shaw, entering his 
seventh season as coach at Long Beach. "It has worked out well. He's a loyal, 
hard-working coach. He's been very successful, and he brings that with him." 
</P>
<P>
Ferragamo will have the added pleasure this season of coaching his nephew, Greg 
Sorensen, a 6-3, 260-pound freshman center from Los Alamitos High. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be an All-American," said his proud uncle. 
</P>
<P>
Sorensen is the third relative Ferragamo has coached. His brother Vince and his 
eldest son, Chris Jr. (class of '80), were both quarterbacks at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
One of the greatest joys in Ferragamo's life is his son, Marcus. The youngest 
of his three children will celebrate his 21st birthday Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At 8, Marcus developed a brain tumor that rendered him legally blind and 
stunted his coordination and growth. 
</P>
<P>
But, like his father, Marcus has persevered through trying times. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a miracle kid," Ferragamo said. "He made it. I spend as much time as I 
can with him." 
</P>
<P>
Together, father and son operate a one-hour photo store in Marina del Rey. The 
business takes up a great deal of Ferragamo's time, but it is time gladly spent 
away from the classroom and football field. 
</P>
<P>
After years of trying to climb the coaching ladder, Ferragamo has taken a step 
back and realized there are other things in life than winning games and 
building football programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I look back at head coaching, it's an awful lot of hard work," he 
said. "I may not want to put in that kind of time again. All coaches go through 
the same thing. You neglect your own family for your job." 
</P>
<P>
That includes his wife of 30 years, Marlene, a consummate football widow. 
</P>
<P>
"She's much happier now," Ferragamo said. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a lot of ways, so is her husband.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When most boxing fans think of the 1988 Olympics, they remember Roy Jones of 
the United States dominating South Korea's Park Si-Hun for three rounds, then 
covering his face and trying to hold back the tears after it was announced he 
had lost a 3-2 decision. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Vaden of San Diego remembers another controversial decision in 1988, but 
unlike Jones, he wasn't able to share his grief with the rest of the world. 
Vaden's loss took place in the quarterfinals of 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials at the 
hands of Kenneth Gould, who went on to win the Olympic bronze medal in the 
147-pound weight class. 
</P>
<P>
Although the decision went to Gould, 3-2, Vaden swears he carried the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't usually question the judges' decision, but I felt I won that fight," 
Vaden said. "People who know boxing thought I had won." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Mustin, Vaden's trainer for the past three years, was in his corner that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt he won it, but knowing you're going up against a guy (Gould) who's been 
groomed in all the (U.S. Boxing Federation) camps for the last four years makes 
it tough," Mustin said. 
</P>
<P>
It was so tough that Vaden basically wrote the rest of the year off. 
</P>
<P>
"All of 1988, that stayed with me," he said. "Constantly after that fight, I'd 
wake up after dreaming that I'd won." 
</P>
<P>
Gracie Vaden, Paul's mother, recalls those bad dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he'll never forget it, but I think it's made him work even harder," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So as the bitterness slowly faded away, hard work and dedication began to take 
over. 
</P>
<P>
The results have been impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Vaden won the gold medal at the 1989 Olympic Festival and the 1990 U.S. 
Championships, and then in June, he decisioned Mario Munoz to win the Goodwill 
Games Boxing Challenge. That victory earned him the opportunity to represent 
the United States in the upcoming Goodwill Games, which begin Friday in 
Seattle. The boxing competition begins July 28. 
</P>
<P>
Based on his record against international competition over the past year, 
Vaden, 22, figures to be one of the favorites to win the gold. In January, he 
decisioned Yugoslavia's Dragen Tomasevic, and two months later, he retired 
Canada's Gerry Burns. 
</P>
<P>
The string of victories -- interrupted by close losses to Hungary's Laszlo Gal 
in the 1989 World Championships in Moscow and the Soviet Union's Dmitri Korsun 
in a USA-USSR boxoff -- has given Vaden the No. 1 ranking in the world at 156 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
With no Cubans entered in his weight division at the Goodwill Games, Vaden's 
toughest competition figures to come from Korsun. Vaden said he can't wait for 
another shot at him. 
</P>
<P>
"That loss made me mentally stronger," he said. "He used his experience to beat 
me. He used about every trick in the book against me. I'll have a couple ready 
for him this time." 
</P>
<P>
So as Vaden continues to build on his resume, he suddenly finds himself in a 
very enviable position. 
</P>
<P>
"Now some of the those things that helped Gould in 1988 may be working in my 
favor this time around if I decide to go for the 1992 Olympics," Vaden said. 
</P>
<P>
"If" appears to be a very big word for Vaden these days. He has been tempted 
before by the promoters who want him to turn professional -- last year, he 
visited the Top Rank stable -- but he has politely declined each offer. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that I want to do is to be the No. 1-ranked amateur for four 
straight years," he said. "Not even Ray Leonard did that. I could also cash in 
on all the Olympic fame if I hang around." 
</P>
<P>
But a good performance at the Goodwill Games may bring the promoters back. 
</P>
<P>
"To win the Goodwill Games would definitely increase my stock," Vaden said. 
"Lately, (turning pro) has crossed my mind. But one thing I would like to do is 
stay away from Bob Arum and Don King. I'd like to be able to be my own 
promoter." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Blankenship, Vaden's cousin and manager, is helping Vaden prepare for that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got nothing against Don King," Vaden said. "He's obviously a smart man, 
but he's more of a heavyweight promoter. People have tried to promote 
themselves before, but nobody has ever done it right." 
</P>
<P>
But then, Vaden has never really done things the conventional way. After boxing 
for six years -- ages eight through 14 -- he quit the sport for four years to 
play basketball at Patrick Henry High School. 
</P>
<P>
But after his senior season of basketball, Vaden put on the boxing gloves 
again. And amazingly enough, it was only months later that Vaden was appearing 
in the Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
"My trainer (Mustin) couldn't believe how I came back after taking a four-year 
hiatus," Vaden said. "It's weird. I could be gone for three months and pick up 
like I'd never left. (Boxing) just stays in my soul." 
</P>
<P>
But for a short while this year, boxing had some company. Vaden fell in love 
and left Mustin and his training camp in Puylallup, Wash., to be with his 
girlfriend in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a person who's always been totally into my boxing, but for the first time 
in my life, I became human," he said. "Tom (Mustin) said this was the year I 
was going to explode and that I needed to be with him. They said she was going 
to mess with my mind -- like Robin Givens had done with Mike Tyson's." 
</P>
<P>
Though not quite as dramatically as Tyson, Vaden did break off his 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"This has still been my best season even with all that," Vaden said. 
</P>
<P>
Mustin wouldn't argue with Vaden's success, but he said Vaden lost some 
valuable training time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on his body punches, but he could have been this far months 
ago," Mustin said. "But he's starting to look pretty good. We've had some great 
training sessions." 
</P>
<P>
It's safe to say the training sessions have not included work on Vaden's hand 
speed, which Mustin calls "the best of anybody in amateur boxing." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mustin said Vaden's hands are sometimes too quick for his own good. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to slow him down, because sometimes he throws so many punches they 
don't stay there long enough to do any damage," said Mustin, who will also help 
coach the U.S. team in the Goodwill Games. "He can get more leverage on his 
blows if he slows down." 
</P>
<P>
Vaden doesn't plan to slow down the pace of his boxing career for a while. When 
he does, Vaden said he plans to pursue a career in entertainment -- he has 
already been featured on a boxing commercial that is still being shown on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
But for the time being, Vaden will stick to what he knows best. 
</P>
<P>
"God has blessed me with this skill," he said, "and I plan to do it better than 
anybody until I quit." 
</P>

2 SENATORS ADJUST TO LIFE IN SLOWER LANE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As state assemblymen, Charles M. Calderon and Frank Hill were known as 
ambitious legislators eager to climb the political ladder and capture higher 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, both of whom live in Whittier, fulfilled their dreams in April, 
winning highly prized promotions to the state Senate in special elections that 
attracted statewide attention. 
</P>
<P>
They quickly moved into new offices, assumed new duties and readied new 
legislative initiatives. But they have found their new environment required an 
adjustment. For both, the initial rush of spring has turned into a summertime 
waiting game. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Hill described the Senate as "slower . . . more methodical, less 
partisan." He acknowledged that he is having to "adjust to a different 
atmosphere, a different style." 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Calderon said he is going through the same process. He described the 
Senate's pace as more deliberate than the 80-member Assembly, in which he and 
Hill had served since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon said one thing that distinguishes the two houses is voting procedure. 
In the Assembly, members push buttons to immediately record their votes. The 
40-member Senate, meanwhile, clings to a drawn-out, 150-year tradition of 
recording votes by lengthy voice roll calls. 
</P>
<P>
Another wrinkle, Calderon noted, is that unlike Assembly members, senators who 
miss a vote cannot later add their names to the roll call. 
</P>
<P>
Although their Assembly backgrounds give Hill and Calderon some advantages, 
there's a limit to the use they can make of these roots. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear), who in 1988 jumped from the Assembly to the 
Senate, said senators frown on being advised about the way the Assembly handles 
legislation. "I would never say, 'This is how the Assembly does it,' " Leonard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard said his two new colleagues "are fitting into their roles of 
representing their districts" and appear to be making a smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
For Calderon and Hill, elevation to the Senate is just one of a number of 
similarities in their careers. They are considered relatively young senators -- 
Hill is 36, Calderon 40. 
</P>
<P>
Further, in each of their special Senate elections, the ongoing FBI 
investigation into political corruption in the Capitol played a role in the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Hill has been one of the targets of the probe since his Capitol office was 
among those raided by the FBI nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Hill easily won his bid to replace former Sen. William Campbell 
(R-Hacienda Heights) in the 31st Senate District. The heavily Republican 
district includes La Habra Heights, La Mirada, Walnut, nearly all of West 
Covina, most of Whittier, part of the City of Industry, Diamond Bar, Hacienda 
Heights and Rowland Heights in Los Angeles County, as well as a section of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the 26th Senate District, Calderon won the seat held by former Democratic 
Sen. Joseph B. Montoya, who resigned in February after his conviction on 
political corruption charges stemming from the FBI investigation. The district 
includes Alhambra, Baldwin Park, El Monte, La Puente, Monterey Park and 
Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon disclosed that, after his victory, Montoya called to wish him well. 
"He told me to work hard and get to know the senators," Calderon recalled, 
because maintaining cordial personal relationships is a more important 
ingredient to legislative success in the upper chamber than in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assembly, Hill was a member of the GOP leadership team that joined Gov. 
George Deukmejian for weekly lunches. Hill said he fretted that in the Senate, 
"It would take me a while to work my way back up." 
</P>
<P>
However, Hill said he believes he is gaining influence in the Senate quicker 
than he had anticipated, noting that he was recently named to a seat on the 
influential Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee. Further, he noted that 
Deukmejian tabbed him to carry the governor's proposal to require 90% of 
California homeowners to obtain earthquake insurance policies covering $15,000 
in damage to their homes and personal property. 
</P>
<P>
Committees that Calderon was named to include the health and housing panels. He 
also was named chairman of the lower-profile Veterans Affairs Committee, even 
though he did not serve in the military. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assembly, Calderon established a reputation for independence. He was one 
of five members, collectively known as "The Gang of Five," who sought to topple 
the leadership of Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). And, in the Senate, 
he has not hesitated to cross swords with one of its veteran members, Art 
Torres (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
After winning his Senate seat, Calderon supported one of his top aides, Marta 
Maestas, in her unsuccessful bid to succeed him in the Assembly. She was 
defeated by Xavier Becerra, whom Torres backed. 
</P>
<P>
One Democratic Senate staff member suggested that the campaign split has 
spilled over into legislative politics. He cited a recent Senate debate over a 
Torres proposal to put the state in the business of operating its own passenger 
airline. In one of his first Senate speeches, Calderon attacked the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cute to discuss the issue, but we ought to consider addressing some of 
the more serious problems facing the state," he told Torres. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, whose bill was defeated, dismissed suggestions of a rift with Calderon, 
citing his resignation from the health and housing panels to make room for his 
new colleague. "I've tried to do everything I can to make sure his presence is 
felt," Torres contended. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon is expected to win a full four-year term in the November election in 
the heavily Democratic district. Hill is not up for reelection for another two 
years.

DIANNE KLEIN: PATTI FRUSTACI'S BIG SURPRISE: SHE'S PREGNANT WITH TWINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patti Frustaci, mother of four, is pregnant again -- with twins. 
</P>
<P>
New life, new hope. A voice inside tells us that we should be pleased. But the 
voice, in my mind, betrays some doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Parenthood has not come easily to Patti and Sam Frustaci. They could not 
conceive naturally and later, when conception finally occurred, it carried a 
high price. 
</P>
<P>
First an infertility specialist helped by administering a common fertility 
drug, Pergonal. The Frustacis said they knew the risks, among them possible 
multiple births. 
</P>
<P>
The drug worked well with the couple's firstborn, Joseph, who's now 6 years 
old, but problems developed with a pregnancy a little more than a year after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Patti Frustaci delivered septuplets -- the nation's first -- at St. Joseph 
Hospital in Orange on May 21, 1985. The infants were 12 weeks premature. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Christina Elizabeth, was dead at birth. Three others, David 
Anthony, James Martin and Bonnie Marie, died within 19 days. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors, Patricia Ann, Richard Charles and Stephen Earl, are 5 years old. 
They are physically and mentally impaired. 
</P>
<P>
The Frustacis sued the doctor who helped them conceive, alleging that he should 
have done more tests before she was artificially inseminated. Last week they 
settled with his insurance carrier for as much as $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Jaroslav Marik had objected so strenuously to not having his day in 
court that he was dropped as a defendant by the time the settlement was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the doctor said that he had done nothing wrong. He recommended 
additional tests, he says; it was Patti Frustaci who didn't want to take the 
time or pay the costs. He says his patient defied other medical instructions as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
She says that none of it is true. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if we'll ever know who was at fault here, or if, indeed, there was 
any fault at all. Medicine has its risks, as does giving birth. Without a 
trial, not even a jury can voice a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Patti Frustaci, a Mormon, ignored the recommendation of her obstetrician that 
she have an abortion after the presence of seven fetuses was diagnosed. The 
doctor cited slim odds of survival; the patient clung to her own moral resolve. 
Both were listening to an internal voice and both certainly have that right. 
</P>
<P>
Yet now Patti Frustaci's latest pregnancy seems to open another door in many 
people's minds. Browne Greene, her attorney, recognizes this too. He says he 
was shocked when he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
"The pregnancy was a factor in the settlement," he says. "It could have gone 
either way with a jury. I had planned to use it as an example of the exact kind 
of care that she should have received before. So that would have been a plus. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, a minus, quite honestly, would have been that we had argued 
about the traumatic emotional experience that she went through with the 
multiple births. The question is, 'Why would she go and do this again?' " 
</P>
<P>
Patti Frustaci says that she wants "another normal child." She took Pergonal 
once again and, this time, it apparently worked according to her plan. Medical 
tests show healthy twins, with an expected due date just before the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But what if something else goes awry? Will the Frustacis sue again? And who is 
to say that they shouldn't have that right, should they so decide? 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, although I haven't lived through it myself, when the 
relationship between doctor and patient was based primarily on trust. Each side 
assumed the other was doing their best, and that was usually good enough. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, there have been abuses on both sides. Attorneys and 
insurance companies have become heavily involved. Medical care, we are 
reminded, is a business. 
</P>
<P>
Malpractice insurance, and such lawsuits as that brought by the Frustacis, have 
frightened many doctors. They say they must protect themselves to survive. 
Especially in the field of obstetrics, many are simply getting out. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big difference betwen maloccurrence and malpractice," says Dr. 
Roger Schlesinger, a North Orange County obstetrician. "Many people do not 
understand that. Malpractice means you have not acted up to the standards of 
care in your locale. Maloccurrence might mean you are the best doctor in the 
world -- and none of us are gods -- but that things do go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Physicians and their insurance companies argue that arbitration agreements, 
signed by doctor and patient before treatment begins, can go a long way toward 
straightening all this out. The signing of such forms is now becoming routine. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a dispute, the agreements state, they will be decided by a 
three-member panel -- usually a doctor, a lawyer and a business person. The 
panels work faster and more cheaply than do the courts. Monetary awards are 
usually less extreme. 
</P>
<P>
Still, patients have their doubts. Many believe -- erroneously, doctors contend 
-- that they are signing away their constitutional rights. Both doctor and 
patient, however, say the agreements can set a more wary tone. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly throws a cloud over the heads of both parties," says Dr. Philip 
Chiu, president of the Orange County OB/GYN Society. "That's why I like to talk 
to the patient first. . . . If it is put in the right light and circumstances, 
there isn't a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Greene says that although Patti Frustaci did not sign an arbitration agreement 
with Marik, he would not necessarily have advised her against it. He says her 
case could have been decided in one week and the costs, of course, would have 
been considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
And as far as he knows, Greene says, the Frustacis have not signed such an 
agreement with her new physician at Loma Linda Hospital, the one who prescribed 
the Pergonal that facilitated her pregnancy with twins. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many physicians are amazed that Patti Frustaci could find anyone to 
treat her after her initial suit. She's made waves. And usually people who do 
so pay a heavy price. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe in the aftermath of the Frustaci experience, all of us will be paying 
a portion of that price. 
</P>
<P>
Who do we trust, many will ask. And how would we know?

NORTH, SOUTH ON COLLISION COURSE OVER AIRPORT SITE; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: A 'CIVIL WAR' ERUPTS BETWEEN NORTHERN CITIES PUSHING FOR A LOCATION 
NEAR SAN CLEMENTE AND SOUTHERN OFFICIALS WHO VOW TO STOP THOSE PLANS.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Newport Beach and its neighbors look for a place to build a regional 
airport, they turn southeast toward Cristianitos Canyon, where a relatively 
flat rural plain east of San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano suggests to them 
a runway. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano Councilman Lawrence F. Buchheim sees it rather differently. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the canyon is within a few miles of his city, San Clemente and 
Mission Viejo -- and pointedly reminding anyone who will listen that aircraft 
using the site would take off almost directly over the San Onofre Nuclear 
Generating Station just over the San Diego County border -- Buchheim said 
bluntly: 
</P>
<P>
"We will use every means at our disposal -- legal, political and otherwise -- 
to stop an airport at Cristianitos." 
</P>
<P>
To the consternation of Buchheim and other South County officials, however, 
Newport Beach and five other northern cities have banded together to pursue 
Cristianitos Canyon for a future airport, even though county supervisors oppose 
all Orange County sites, preferring one in remote San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach group plans to interview engineering firms later this month 
and hire one to outline the work needed to develop either Cristianitos or 
another local site. 
</P>
<P>
In South County, the howls of protest are loud and shrill, and some officials 
worry that the emotional debate is already severely fracturing relations 
between northern and southern county cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a north-south fight is what it is," said Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), 
whose district includes South Orange County. "It's the Civil War all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
In this war between the cities, the Mason-Dixon line runs just north and west 
of Tustin, and the players line up neatly by geography: The Orange County 
Cities Airport Authority includes members from Garden Grove, Anaheim, Stanton, 
Santa Ana, Yorba Linda and Newport Beach. Its opponents are led by San Clemente 
and include officials from Dana Point, San Juan Capistrano, Mission Viejo, 
Tustin and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
None of the cities, predictably, wants a new airport in its back yard. All say 
they are willing to play hardball to see that one is not planted next door. 
</P>
<P>
It all makes for an explosive showdown. Threats of legal action have become 
common, and officials have leveled blistering broadsides at each other in 
public sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our City Council is livid," said Bill Mecham, a former mayor of San Clemente 
now acting as an airport consultant to that city. "It's regarded here as a very 
adversarial situation." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Delino, deputy city manager of Newport Beach and founder of the airport 
group, acknowledged that the authority's work has stirred passions and that it 
has not made him many friends in South County. 
</P>
<P>
"They've told me not only no, but hell no," Delino said. "They made it clear 
that they're going to fight it tooth and nail." 
</P>
<P>
Packard could not agree more: "I will block them any way I can. If I have any 
influence at all, I will use it to keep this airport from being built in South 
County." 
</P>
<P>
Packard has been even more vocally opposed to another potential airport site, 
on Camp Pendleton land north of Oceanside. Supporters say such a regional 
facility would relieve overcrowding at both Orange and San Diego county 
airports, while opponents say that site would compromise the undeveloped Marine 
Corps buffer zone between burgeoning South Orange County and North San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The intensity has become particularly sharp during the last several weeks 
because South County officials thought they had put the issue to rest. The 
supervisors' appointed Airport Site Coalition, after two years of study, 
identified Cristianitos Canyon as one of two sites most worth pursuing, noting 
its low cost, easy access and private ownership. Leland Oliver, who led that 
group, called Cristianitos "eminently flyable." 
</P>
<P>
But the supervisors rejected that advice unanimously, instead voting to pursue 
development of George Air Force Base, near Adelanto in San Bernardino County, 
into a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
South County officials were overjoyed and confident that the issue was dead. 
But within a month, the northern cities had it back on the table, and the 
battle was back on. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to put all our eggs in the George basket," said Newport's 
Delino. "In the meantime, we're fighting to keep the other sites alive." 
</P>
<P>
For the northern cities, the concern about George is that if it does not hold 
up under scrutiny, the supervisors will reopen the site search and could end up 
picking a North County location. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no studies, no nothing on George," said Henry W. Wedaa, a Yorba Linda 
councilman and longtime chairman of the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments' aviation committee. "It's a bunch of nonsense. The supervisors 
just took an escape mechanism for avoiding a tough decision." 
</P>
<P>
Like many officials, Wedaa predicted that the tough decisions still lie ahead 
and that the county's cities have not seen the last of its airport squabbling. 
South and north will continue to wage the battle until a site is finally picked 
and under construction, said Wedaa, whose own preference is for converting El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a joint military-civilian airport. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better," Wedaa said. "But if we 
are going to be responsible politicians, we have to address this."

HUNTING AN ELUSIVE PREY; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY RESIDENTS COMB PARKS, SEA BLUFFS TO COUNT BUTTERFLIES

<P>
Beneath a sweltering sun and the lithe black willow trees, amid the salt 
grasses, the pickleweed and the wild grassy growth of orange witch's hair, they 
hunted an elusive prey Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Some 40 county residents, young and old, armed themselves with mesh nets and 
water canteens to scour parklands and ocean bluffs from Tustin to Newport Beach 
as part of a nationwide, once-a-year butterfly census. They met at 10 a.m. at 
UC Irvine's arboretum and at Bowers Museum in Santa Ana before fanning out 
across the county for the search. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they found fewer butterflies this year, in part because of the 
drought that has scorched the Southern California landscape but also because of 
the steady decline of the butterfly family resulting from years of development. 
The annual count is sponsored by the Xerces Society, a national preservation 
group that takes its name from a tiny, now-extinct butterfly that once wandered 
the blue skies above San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of environmentalists believe that butterflies are kind of on the front 
line of defense," explained Larry Shaw, 34, a biologist who works for the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't see as many butterflies year after year, you wonder why," 
continued Shaw, who organized the Orange County contingent of the nationwide 
search. "They're kind of an indicator species because they're so delicate." 
</P>
<P>
If there were fewer butterflies to count this year, it didn't dampen the 
enthusiasm of the eight volunteers who scoured Caspers Regional Park in Irvine. 
Fred Soria and his three children, who live in Garden Grove, watched 
breathlessly as they waited for just the right moment to swoop a net down on a 
blue Pygmy, the tiniest butterfly in the world, who just happens to call 
Southern California home. 
</P>
<P>
"Careful, careful. Let him land," Soria told his children. "There he is right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the swoosh, swoosh of 12-year-old Talia Soria's net and the blue 
Pygmy was captured, examined, noted on an inventory sheet and freed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it," Shaw confirmed before freeing the rare butterfly. "This is the 
smallest butterfly in the world." 
</P>
<P>
"There's one right here," called out 10-year-old Henry Lim, who chased the 
apparently more prolific wandering skipper. "There's another. There's three!" 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's hunt also offered a rudimentary biology class for the novice 
butterfly afficionado. The butterfly, Shaw explained, is part of the arthropod 
family. Its less attractive relatives include spiders, other insects, 
centipedes, crayfish, crabs and lobsters. 
</P>
<P>
There are thousands of varieties of butterflies in the world, 80 to 100 of 
which are found in Orange County. Most live only three to four weeks once they 
leave their cocoon-like pupae, travel no more than a few hundred yards and mate 
only once. One type, the desert swallow, may wait as long as seven years for a 
lush, rainy season before shedding its protective shell and emerging as a 
butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
"How unfortunate. Such a short life span," mused Kristina Adamek, a Costa Mesa 
resident. "I hope they're happy every moment. At least we have some time to 
repair." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's highlight was a glimpse at a morning cloak that had just shed its 
pupa that morning. Still in mint condition, with no scratches or bird bites, 
the butterfly gently batted its gilded black velvet wings as it rested on a 
tree trunk preparing for flight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just so perfect," Shaw said. "That one has not flown yet. He's just 
exercising his muscles." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the find, Saturday's relentless heat proved too much for 6-year-old 
Chelsea Soria.

DOWN-HOME PARTY RAISES $40,000 FOR HOMELESS

<TEXT>
<P>
From the outside, the high-priced cars parked at the Crazy Horse Steak House on 
Saturday afternoon made it appear as if a convention of BMW and Mercedes-Benz 
dealers was taking place at the club. 
</P>
<P>
But inside, more than 250 people gathered for an event benefiting people on the 
opposite end of the economic scale. Paying $150 a ticket, the luxury-car crowd 
packed the Santa Ana venue to hear singer, songwriter and actor Kris 
Kristofferson perform to benefit Orange County's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Kristofferson participated in a five-hour barbecue and concert hosted by the 
Orange County Building Industry Assn. as part of its ongoing HomeAid program. 
</P>
<P>
"This is turning out better than I thought it would," said Julie Brinkerhoff, 
one of the organizers of the fund-raiser. "We were fortunate to get the likes 
of Kris Kristofferson, who is very committed to helping the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Kristofferson has appeared at numerous benefit functions, including FarmAid and 
concerts for Vietnam veterans. However, in the last few years, the performer 
has become increasingly concerned about the nation's growing homeless 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't leave it up to the politicians to solve this problem," Kristofferson 
said. "We, as people and concerned citizens, must take it on ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Housing officials estimate the county could have from 8,000 to 10,000 homeless 
people, many of whom are children. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that Saturday's hoedown raised about $40,000 in donations, 
including $13,500 in corporate sponsorships. Since the program's inception, 
more than $750,000 has been raised. 
</P>
<P>
HomeAid was created last year by the BIA, which promised to build or renovate 
five shelters throughout the county. The nonprofit program pulls together 
donations of time, materials and money from the building industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bart Hansen, vice chairman of HomeAid and principal of Shawntana Development, 
said he has been astounded by the positive response of the building industry to 
HomeAid. In addition, he said, HomeAid is proving to be such a success that 
building industry associations in San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura and Los 
Angeles counties are showing interest in the program. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the proposed $1-million program has been responsible for construction 
of a $350,000 duplex in El Modena and the renovation of three shelters -- 
Thomas House in Garden Grove, Interval House for abused women in unincorporated 
Midway City and Anchor House in San Clemente. The program also is sponsoring 
the partial reconstruction of the New Vista House, a shelter in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lennon, director of HomeAid, said the economic slowdown in the building 
industry may hamper future donations to the program, but he is hopeful that 
projects will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It could slow us down a bit," he said. "But everyone is committed to this 
program. We all share a common cause: to help with the homeless in any way we 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Christine D. Reed, executive director of the region's BIA and former director 
of the state Housing and Community Development Agency, said it is vital that 
the private sector get involved with this issue.

OFFENSE GETS THE JOB DONE AS BULLPEN BOMBS AGAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
The chant already has been heard at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Hill, we want Hill." 
</P>
<P>
With any more relief like the Angels have been getting lately -- or more 
precisely, with any less relief -- it could become a standard. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill, the Angels' jack-of-all-positions, pitched an inning of emergency 
relief in a disastrous 20-7 loss Sunday to the Milwaukee Brewers in a game Bert 
Blyleven started. 
</P>
<P>
Hill didn't allow a hit. 
</P>
<P>
The Angel bullpen was called on again Saturday night, this time when Blyleven 
left with a 3-1 lead over Toronto after five innings at Anaheim Stadium. And 
once again, it was bye-bye Bert, bye-bye lead. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, it looked like bye-bye ballgame, until Brian Downing won it, 8-7, 
with his second homer of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bailes followed Blyleven on Saturday, giving up a run in two-thirds of an 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Which was better than what he accomplished Sunday, when he gave up a run in a 
third of an inning. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Fraser followed Bailes, and gave up two runs in one inning. Cliff Young 
came next, a left-hander making his major league debut. He was charged with two 
runs in his one inning, although both Manager Doug Rader and pitching coach 
Marcel Lachemann said they were pleased with his performance. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Harvey was next, and he wasn't spared -- one inning, three hits, three 
walks, one run -- the tying run in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
When his last walk loaded the bases with the score tied in the ninth, he was 
done. 
</P>
<P>
Can you say collapse? 
</P>
<P>
Enter Mark Eichhorn, pitcher No. 6. He was just in time to earn the victory, 
his first of the season. 
</P>
<P>
If not for an extraordinary six-home run output by the Angel offense, the game 
wouldn't have been close. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some good defensive plays today," Lachemann said. "We did a lot of 
things a team has to do to win. Today it wasn't pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Bailes talked about his recent outings earlier in the week, calling it "the 
worst stretch I've ever had in my life." 
</P>
<P>
It might also be the result of knowing his spot on the team is precarious, he 
and Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, who recently went home after his father suffered a heart attack, said 
he felt "out of sync" after the time away. 
</P>
<P>
Becasue of the All-Star break and two complete games by the starters in the 
past four days, not much has been asked of the bullpen lately. 
</P>
<P>
Not much asked, and not much given.

RECOVERY HAS BEEN SLOW, BUT RAMS' HAWKINS COMING AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To date, Bill Hawkins' greatest moment as a Ram probably came Saturday, almost 
two months before the season opener, in front of a dozen spectators, tops. He 
knocked around the blocking sled at Rams Park like it was standing still. OK, 
it was. But when he sprang from his three-point stance his left leg actually 
joined the party. Later, there was a quiet celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was my best day, by far," Hawkins said later. "It (his leg) didn't feel 
like a string of spaghetti hanging off my left side." 
</P>
<P>
Food for thought, considering the Rams are counting on first-round things from 
their defensive end and top choice of 1989. Hawkins wasn't so sure what he 
would bring to the field this year until, well, a few hours ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 11, just as he appeared ready to silence critics who had waited 
impatiently for his first NFL sack, Hawkins collapsed in a fourth-quarter heap 
against San Francisco, after partially tearing ligaments in his left knee. It 
was surgically repaired three days later. 
</P>
<P>
That was then, though, this is now. Why was Hawkins, the team's biggest 
pass-rushing hope on the line since Jack Youngblood, still limping around in 
July? 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, too, wondered what had become of the miracles of modern medicine and 
rehabilitation. He'd never been injured before, unless you count contusions and 
concussions. Hawkins doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Concussions are nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So what weren't the doctors telling him? 
</P>
<P>
"The knee took a long time to respond," Hawkins said. "Gie (Strength coach 
Garrett Giemont) was saying, 'No problem, no problem.' But I don't think it was 
three weeks ago that I could barely come out of a stance. Maybe a month. I was 
worried. Giemont kept assuring me, but I would be thinking, 'I can't come out 
of my stance!' " 
</P>
<P>
Giemont tried explaining that there was a distinct difference between a knee 
that bends well enough to pick up the newspaper and one that bends well enough 
to pick up a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"If he worked at IBM, he'd be out of our clinic," Giemont said, "but we're 
talking about a football rehabilitation. . . . It's getting him prepared to get 
back to playing in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Giemont said he understands Hawkins' concerns because it's the player's first 
serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
"When you haven't been hurt, it's like going down to the beach and putting your 
toe in the water," he said. "What do you do from there?" 
</P>
<P>
The coaches are handling Hawkins with care until early August, when they plan 
to turn him loose in full-contact drills. If they're secretly worried about his 
knee, they're all poker faces. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a recurring injury," Rams Coach John Robinson said. "What he's 
building up is strength. We don't have a wounded guy." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Rams are drawing up all sorts of new defensive schemes with 
Hawkins in mind. This season, the team plans to pair him with linebacker Kevin 
Greene on early downs, on the weak side of scrimmage, the side opposite the 
offense's tight end. 
</P>
<P>
It will mean less responsibility for stopping the run and more on rushing the 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to play it," Hawkins said. "I just cannot wait. This is going to 
be fun. True blue fun. It'll be like what we used to do back in school.' 
</P>
<P>
That would be the University of Miami, where Hawkins emerged as the 21st pick 
in the first round in 1989. Slowed by a late signing, Hawkins didn't turn many 
heads with the Rams last season, although he'd made considerable progress by 
December. He finished the season with 11 tackles and no sacks in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said he doesn't feel pressure to perform to the expectations of a 
former first-rounder, but promises that he will. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants me to play well more than I do," he said. "If I'm not good enough 
to play, I won't consider myself a waste. If I'm trying my hardest, and I don't 
produce, then it wasn't my fault. But I know that I can produce, and I will." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said he took to heart some early advice from Giemont, whom he would 
soon get to know well on the long road through rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got here, Gie took me aside and said, 'This isn't college, this 
isn't high school, this is a career,' " Hawkins recalled. " 'You have your ups 
and downs. Hopefully, you'll be here in 10 years.' And I took to that."

Millions of pounds of household hazardous wastes end up in landfills each year. 
Products such as household cleaners, pesticides, motor oil and others can 
contaminate the water supply when improperly disposed. 
</P>
<P>
We hear a lot about avoiding toxic chemicals because they're harmful to our 
environment. But what are safer choices? The accompanying list shows nontoxic 
alternatives for paints, household cleaners and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
By choosing non-hazardous alternatives -- such as vinegar instead of a 
commercial window cleaner -- you'll save money, have a healthier home and 
preserve our environment. 
</P>
<P>
To find out where you can take leftover household cleaners, paint, car 
batteries, pesticides, glues, disinfectants and more, call the California 
Integrated Waste Management Board's Recycling Hotline, (800) 553-2962.

INTERIORS: THE MAGIC OF A HOME WITH WOODEN FLOORS; 
</P>
<P>
INTERIORS: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHOICES IN THE TYPE OF WOODS AVAILABLE WHEN 
INSTALLING FLOORS, MANY OF THEM ARE PREFINISHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS GIBSON, Gibson is a Malibu free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each year, manufacturers introduce new, improved types of man-made flooring, 
all perfectly uniform. But wood remains a universal favorite for its durability 
and the timeless, matchless charm of its natural irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
A tree trunk is ringed because the large, soft cells of its rapid springtime 
growth contrast with the dark, dense cells of its slower summer growth. 
Cellular structure determines the density, direction, color and pattern of each 
tree's grain. 
</P>
<P>
Today, most flooring is made from logs cheaply slash-cut with circular band 
saws. A century ago, more flooring was sawed at an angle. This costlier method 
produces elaborately patterned edge-grain on two faces, revealing the full 
beauty of the wood. 
</P>
<P>
Because moisture makes it swell and warp, raw lumber must be dried in an 
artificially heated kiln that evaporates three-fourths of the wood's sap and 
cellular fluid. Another 10% is forced from cell walls, shrinking boards across 
the grain to create hard, strong, light flooring. 
</P>
<P>
Such softwoods as pine, fir and redwood are often used for Colonial or rustic 
plank floors with beveled edge to simulate cracks and walnut plugs to simulate 
antique pegs. Budget-minded remodelers sometimes floor older homes with 
1-by-6-inch tongued-and-grooved pine roofing boards secured by quaint, 
old-fashioned, oblong-headed cut nails. 
</P>
<P>
However, as softwoods are less wear-resistant because their cells are less 
dense, hardwood strips far outsell them. In greatest demand are 3/4-by-2 
1/4-inch oak strips of random length, installed at zigzag intervals or in a 
herringbone pattern. For snug fit, each strip is milled with a projecting 
tongue on one side and a groove on the other. Nails driven through tongues are 
hidden by grooves. 
</P>
<P>
Experts differ as to whether ends should be tongued-and-grooved. Some contend 
that square-edged strips with interlocking sides lie just as flat. Others 
insist they squeak. According to Jim Martin of Malibu Lumber, "the tighter the 
fit, the stronger the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Square-edged strips require face-nailing and "may throw off stability," warns 
Jeff Brotman of Virginia Hardwood, "because boards want to move as much as they 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Parquet flooring is another popular wood floor. Block parquets are solid, 
unfinished, tongued-and-grooved squares composed of hardwood pieces splined 
together to form a decorative mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
Oak is, again, the most popular wood, 12-by-12-inch the most popular size, 
alternating cross-matched strips the most popular pattern. However, blocks from 
4-by-4 inches to 4-by-4 feet are made in a dazzling array of tones and woods, 
forming intricate patterns copied from palaces throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
Laminated parquets are cheaper squares of thin board, bonded together like 
plywood, sold by floor-covering dealers. They are set into mastic, much like 
resilient tiles. Todd Hamar of Galleher Hardwood says, "Laminates are not on a 
par with block parquets, but they come in attractive patterns and, unlike 
blocks, they can be installed by do-it-yourselfers." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "Hardwood Flooring," expert Dan Ramsey cautions homeowners to buy 
only from reputable dealers. He adds that, if buyers tell dealers they are 
shopping around for discounted flooring, most retailers "will either work out 
some type of discount or . . . suggest when that discount will be available." 
</P>
<P>
About half of America's strip flooring is sold prefinished, a boon for 
non-professional installers. Prefinished floors are virtually maintenance-free. 
</P>
<P>
Renovators are advised to scratch a coin against an old, discolored floor. If 
the finish doesn't flake off, it is probably penetrating seal, which can be 
restored without sanding. Sometimes worn, dingy floors merely need a 
wax-stripper, a new coat of linseed oil, a treatment with turpentine-soaked 
steel wool to remove old shellac or a liquid varnish remover and a light 
sanding. 
</P>
<P>
Unfinished and ruined floors require a great deal more work and are best left 
to professionals. Mistakes in installation and finishing are apt to cost far 
more than the fee charged by a professional who knows how to match obsolete 
patterns, protect and beautify wood, make new floors look antique and old 
floors look new. 
</P>
<P>
Once the floor has been installed or restored to its original luster, it should 
never be washed or wet-mopped. Scrubbing rots wood. However impervious the 
finish, water can seep between boards to stain and warp them. All the floor 
needs is vacuuming or dust-mopping, an occasional buff to remove heel marks and 
rewaxing once or twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
DAMAGE CONTROL 
</P>
<P>
Buy good flooring. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully inspect floorboards before accepting delivery. 
</P>
<P>
If lumber is stored outdoors, protect it from dampness. 
</P>
<P>
Acclimate new flooring by storing it two to three days in the room where it 
will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
Do all necessary painting before installing the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Never install flooring until all interior concrete is dry. 
</P>
<P>
Flooring over a cement slab requires special protection and expert advice. 
</P>
<P>
Never install wood floors in a damp basement or one susceptible to flooding. 
</P>
<P>
When estimating cost, remember that quoted lumber dimensions are less than 
actual size (a 2-by-4 measures 1 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches). Dan Ramsey's rule of 
thumb: actual board footage equals number of pieces by thickness by width by 
length divided by 12. 
</P>
<P>
Insulate floors over furnaces and heating ducts to prevent future cracks. 
</P>
<P>
Insulate to soundproof upstairs floors. 
</P>
<P>
When planning floors, never assume walls are straight. They seldom are. 
</P>
<P>
For a professional look, frame obstacles, such as hearths and pillars, with 
mitered molding. 
</P>
<P>
Save short flooring strips for doorways and closets. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid hollows, never let a turned-on drum sander touch the ground unless it 
is moving. 
</P>
<P>
Dust thoroughly after each sanding. 
</P>
<P>
When applying finish, always allow recommended drying time between coats. 
</P>
<P>
If a damaged spot cannot be invisibly patched, refinish the entire floorboard. 
</P>
<P>
When moving heavy furniture, slide it along the floor on a scrap of blanket or 
carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
Rubber, plastic and foam-backed mats may discolor floors. 
</P>
<P>
Put cups under metal furniture casters. 
</P>
<P>
If humidity exceeds 50%, ventilate rooms to keep floorboards from swelling. 
</P>
<P>
In very cold or dry weather, humidify rooms to keep floorboards from shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
In rainy weather, close windows, protect exterior doorways, repair leaks and 
don't track water across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
FLOOR REPAIR 
</P>
<P>
For fine lines and cracks in hardwood: humidify room. 
</P>
<P>
For cracks between softwood planks: clean out and pack with hemp rope or a wood 
glue-and-sawdust paste. (plastic fillers shrink.) Span very wide cracks with 
wood strips. Sand, stain and rewax. 
</P>
<P>
For "bouncy" floors: check beneath house for undersized joists. Hire a 
professional to stabilize or augment them. 
</P>
<P>
For a squeaky floorboard: for wet weather squeak, soak with liquid wax. Or pour 
talcum powder or powdered graphite between boards. For persistent squeak, drive 
triangular glaziers' points between boards. Tamp down with a putty knife. Or 
countersink 2-inch finishing nails through both ends of board, putty nail 
holes, sand and wax. 
</P>
<P>
For creaking floors: see whether nails holding subfloor to joists have 
loosened. If so, drive wedge between joist and loose subfloor board. If several 
boards are loose, nail a strip of wood across them and secure it to joist. 
</P>
<P>
For a loose board in the finish floor: countersink 2-inch finishing nails with 
a nail punch, angling them into subfloor. Putty, sand and stain nail holes. 
Rewax. 
</P>
<P>
For warped, bulging finish floorboards: cover with heavy paper and a plank. Tap 
plank sharply with a hammer, taking care not to split tongued-and-grooved 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
For sagging or inward-sloping floors: see if girders or joists have been

Perhaps the only thing more sickening than the subject matter of Stumbo's "A

They have no place in what purports to be serious journalism.

I am a former child star. Uniquely grotesque as it seems, the smashing of the 
Coleman family's gold-plated communal bowl is only one more in a long train of 
similar tragedies to befall child stars. 
</P>
<P>
The saddest part is that all these weful endings were as predictable as any 
seasonal hurricane zeroing in on the Texas Gulf. Reversing roles of dependent 
and providfer leads to almost certain disaster for all concerned. But as long 
as the performing child's salary continues to shower money on the family, the 
persons most responsible -- adults who should be in charge -- ignore the storm 
warnings until it's too late.Adults are meant to care for small children, not 
the other way around. "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature!" the margarine TV 
commercial proclaimed. Let the greedy parents of today's budding child stars 
read their own future and take heed.

It's too bad that Gary Coleman and his parents are spending lots of money on 
lawyers today. Instead, they could have spent less money on 
therapists/counselors with less adversarial outcomes.

Maybe it's not too late.

As reported, we represent Gary Coleman in connection with his action against 
his parents to recover certain funds received bythem while acting as Coleman's 
personal managers, guardians and trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Any assertion that an action was filed against Coleman's parents with "no 
substantiating evidence" is absolutely false. 
</P>
<P>
More than sufficient evidence existed to warrant the filing of an action 
against Coleman's parents and his former business manager. Unfortunately, 
Coleman's damages and the full extent of the defendants' wrongdoing could not 
then be determined because Coleman's former business manager refused to turn 
over Coleman's own books and records. Those books and records were finally 
relinquished only after Coleman's action was filed, and only then could an 
audit be conducted to determine the full extent of Coleman's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Your assertion that this firm persuaded Coleman to sue his parents against his 
will is equally spurious. Neither Coleman nor the members of this firm chose to 
believe that Coleman's parents would be so avaricious as to take advantage of 
their son's success in such a way. For that reason, no punitive or examplary 
damages were requested of Col;eman's parents in his complaint. Yet, the fact 
remains that his parents have refused to repay a single penny of the monies 
that they received in excess of that previously authorized.

A RADICAL NOTION; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN: CALLING HIMSELF 'AN ARTIST WHO MAKES FURNITURE,' DAVID MOCARSKI FUSES 
FINE AND FUNCTIONAL ART. HIS ADOPTED SLOGAN: 'FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson is a Los Angeles architect and author whose most 
recent book is The Watts Towers of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Behind the unmarked door of an anonymous brick building stand the workshop and 
showroom of radical furniture designer David Mocarski. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath its quiet exterior, Mocarski's Santa Monica shop is a fanfare of 
not-so-quiet design statements. 
</P>
<P>
In the form of tables and chairs, hard-edged steel clashes with swirling glass 
and sleek veneered woods. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the showroom, smooth surfaces face off against jagged edges in a 
fight "to create a metaphor for today's life structure," according to the 
designer. 
</P>
<P>
One Mocarski table, whimsically titled "Easy Mistake/Rearview Mirror," evokes a 
freeway pileup. Its wide glass top teeters over crunched steel chunks that are 
strung together with iron bars. 
</P>
<P>
"To Open the Moment/Crossroads" is a more serene table of butter-yellow steel 
under a glass oblong. It is designed to deliver the same message of urban 
frenzy but in sleeker form. 
</P>
<P>
In another corner of the living room-sized showroom stand a bar table and 
stool. With slices of burnished aluminum and sturdy posture, it seems brash 
enough for a rowdy singles bar. 
</P>
<P>
Operating under the commercial label Taction Design, Mocarski's highly 
individual furniture has received increasing international recognition. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the designer has had one-man shows in both Tokyo's 
prestigious Axis Gallery and Santa Monica's Art Options gallery. His work also 
was included in New York City's International Contemporary Furniture Fair. 
</P>
<P>
"David's designs are unique fusions of fine and functional art," said Santa 
Monica gallery owner Karl Bornstein, who not only has displayed Mocarski's 
furniture but has some of his chairs and tables at home. "His things are not 
only highly crafted and beautiful, but also easy to live with." 
</P>
<P>
The fusion of fine and functional art in Mocarski's work reflects the 
designer's personal history. As a boy, he worked beside his father and 
grandfather in their Cleveland, Ohio, cabinetry shop. 
</P>
<P>
As an adult, Mocarski's earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from UC Santa 
Barbara and spent a decade teaching painting, drawing and printmaking at 
Pasadena's Art Center College of Design. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned to work with my hands as soon as I could hold a chisel," Mocarski 
said. "The smell of fresh wood shavings and carpenter's glue still lingers in 
my nostrils. 
</P>
<P>
"This gave me a deep reverence for craftsmanship and a feeling for how physical 
objects are put together in the simplest and strongest ways," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, lean 39-year-old with deep-set black eyes, big hands and a shy smile, 
Mocarski retains the slightly puzzled air of a displaced Midwestern craftsman. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, after a decade as a painter and sculptor, Mocarski became a 
full-time furniture maker, thanks to a group of people who owned some of his 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who collected David's work said how nice it would be if he were 
free to make furniture full-time," Bornstein said. "So a bunch of us got 
together and set him up in Taction Design, to provide a financial basis for his 
artistic freedom." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to reach a broader range of people than those one meets as a painter 
and printmaker," said Mocarski. "And I felt that functional art offered me more 
scope to express my ideas." 
</P>
<P>
The stylistic ideas that interest Mocarski include the early Modernist concepts 
developed by the Russian Constructivists, the German Bauhaus and the Dutch De 
Stijl movement. Such design philosophies, he said, still contain much untapped 
creative energy. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles art critic Peter Frank wrote of Mocarski's Modernist revival 
designs: "In the shuffle of world events, contradictory ideologies and shifting 
fashions, these ideas have not succeeded or failed but simply fallen between 
the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
By ignoring the traditional boundaries that separate functional from fine art, 
Frank suggested that Mocarski has reinterpreted the unfulfilled early modern 
ideas in a Postmodern manner. 
</P>
<P>
Mocarski, 39, said he chose the name "Taction" for his design studio because 
the word suggests touching and action. 
</P>
<P>
"It signifies to me a conceptual and tactile communication, a kind of reaching 
out in sense and sensibility beyond the preserve of purely formal art," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles fashion designer Elaine Johnson, another steady Mocarski client, 
said she admires the designer's professionalism as well as his creativity. 
</P>
<P>
"David's no flake; he always delivers on time," Johnson said. "The finished 
quality of his stuff is terrific, and it has to be, to satisfy someone as fussy 
as me. And he's flexible, he'll listen to what you want and adapt his designs 
to suit." 
</P>
<P>
Mocarski prefers to visit his clients' homes to see how they live before 
creating one of his $5,000 tables or sideboards. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of my designs are born of conversations with the patron," he said. "I 
also take photos of the interiors of the house or office, make a lot of notes, 
and discuss budgets and materials. A successful design is always a 
collaboration." 
</P>
<P>
The designer said he resists being tagged "one of the trendy Angeleno furniture 
artists who seem so often to be no more than fashionable flash-in-the-pans. 
I've seen a lot of people get a quirky California label." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the currently fashionable art furniture is thoroughly uncomfortable, 
Mocarski claimed. "Designers who don't really understand how furniture is put 
together by craftsmen and used by people concentrate solely on the aesthetics 
of a piece. Torture chairs and vicious tables are all too often the result." 
</P>
<P>
Mocarski himself finishes many of his chairs and tables, burnishing the 
aluminum, adjusting the steel elements and sanding the wood surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
The membrane that separates his showroom from his workshop is a thin sheet of 
plastic through which the working silhouettes of Mocarski's two busy assistants 
can been seen. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Taction's objects are hard-edged and high-style. Several nostalgic 
designs, such as the "Kazimer/Take Me Back" chair, are inspired by memories of 
his grandmother's house (which stood on Kazimer Street). They feature simple 
wooden members and fat padded seats, suggesting a sort of primal "chairness." 
</P>
<P>
The straightforward "Spanner" chair and the Art Deco-inspired "Tip of the 
Iceberg" side table luxuriate in nostalgia for a more gracious and easeful 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Taction's glass-topped "Counterpoint/Side Stander" tables are playful 
assemblies of colored Formica. His junky "Moonlight City" wall sconces might be 
comfortable in a Montessori kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics object to aspects of Mocarski's designs they perceive to be 
tainted by "prettiness." 
</P>
<P>
Architect Diana Wong of Johnson, Fain &amp; Pereira Associates, the project 
designer for the Karl Bornstein Gallery, accused Mocarski of straddling the 
fence between an honest expression of his hard-edged materials and a "slightly 
corrupt" desire to please. 
</P>
<P>
"David wobbles between the functional and the cosmetic," Wong said. "His steel 
tables, for instance, may start out sharp and raw, but he ends up painting them 
cosmetically. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it happens precisely because he wants his pieces to function as art 
objects and as domesticated furnishings, where most other 'art furniture' is 
shamelessly more art than furniture," said Wong. 
</P>
<P>
Replied Mocarski: "I'm an artist who makes furniture. I believe that at the 
best level, art and usage can be seamlessly fused. The Modernist slogan was, 
after all, Form Follows Function -- and that's my slogan, too."

HARPER IS A BIG CATCH FOR TWINS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER A LONG BATTLE UP MAJOR LEAGUE LADDER, HE FINDS SUCCESS IN 
MINNESOTA. 
</P>

<P>
Former San Pedro High standout Brian Harper has produced All-Star-caliber 
statistics for the Minnesota Twins in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But is Harper complaining or feeling slighted about not being voted into the 
starting lineup for Tuesday's All-Star Game by the fans or being selected by 
American League Manager Tony La Russa as a reserve? 
</P>
<P>
No way. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just thrilled to be on the All-Star ballot, to be honest," Harper said. 
"There were a lot of big-name catchers doing well this year. Lance Parrish (of 
the Angels) is doing great. I'm very surprised that Carlton Fisk didn't make 
the team." 
</P>
<P>
Harper, a fourth-round draft pick of the Angels in 1977, toiled for 13 seasons 
before reaching All-Star status. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, he had been a part of six major league teams. He had been released 
by three of them and was traded by two others. 
</P>
<P>
He's made the most of his opportunity with the Twins, taking a .311 batting 
average, 10th in the American League, into Friday's action. His current average 
is higher than perennial AL hit leader Wade Boggs (.306) of the Boston Red Sox 
and a point less than his better-known teammate, Kirby Puckett. Boggs and 
Puckett were named to the AL All-Star roster. 
</P>
<P>
Harper batted .325 in 1989, and was given the starter's job on a permanent 
basis in August. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a "dream come true" for Harper, who with his wife, Chris, has lived 
in more parts of the country than he probably cared to. 
</P>
<P>
"For my wife and I, we have a strong relationship together," Harper said. "So 
that really helps a lot. We also have a commitment to the Lord and believe that 
he is really in control of all the moves. When you believe that, then it's a 
lot easier to go to and from a lot of these places. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been together every week of our marriage. She's been with me throughout 
the year, even when I've played winter ball. We've been married since 1980." 
</P>
<P>
They met at San Pedro High when Harper was 15. About two years later, after 
earning All-CIF honors, Harper signed a professional contract after being 
selected by the Angels in the June, 1977, free-agent draft. He was called by 
the Angels in September, 1979, at 19. Harper appeared in one game with two 
at-bats and no hits. 
</P>
<P>
He put together some good seasons up to that point -- batting averages of .323 
at Idaho Falls, Ida., in '77, .293 at Quad Cities (Iowa) in '78, and .315 at El 
Paso in '79. Full seasons at El Paso, where he hit .285 in '80 and at triple-A 
Salt Lake City, where he hit .350 with 28 home runs and 122 runs batted in in 
'81, earned another promotion to the big club at the end of the '81 season. In 
four games with the Angels he hit .273 with three hits in 11 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels knew they had a good hitter in Harper, but they weren't as certain 
about his defensive abilities as a catcher. New Angel Manager Gene Mauch had a 
preference for veteran ballplayers, so California traded Harper to the 
Pittsburgh Pirates for veteran infielder Tim Foli in December, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time the Angels were a good team and they were trying to get even 
better, so they were going for the veteran players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even after stops in Idaho Falls, Quad Cities, El Paso, Salt Lake City and 
Anaheim, the Harpers' journey was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Pirates were willing to trade Foli for the young catcher, it should 
have meant a stable home for the Harpers in Pittsburgh. But that was not the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
He spent most of the '82 season with the Pirates' top minor league team in 
Portland, Ore., where he hit .284 with 17 home runs and 73 RBIs. When brought 
up to the major leagues later that year, he appeared in 20 games and hit .276 
in 29 at-bats with two home runs. His first major league homer was hit off San 
Diego left-hander Dave Dravecky. 
</P>
<P>
But with Tony Pena already in the starting lineup, the Pirates were using 
Harper anywhere but as a catcher. He was a pinch-hitter and reserve outfielder 
and was on the roster for the remainder of '82 and all of '83 and '84 seasons. 
But during those 2 1/2 half seasons, he had only 272 at-bats in 127 games with 
averages of .221 in '83 and .259 in '84. 
</P>
<P>
"All through high school and the minor leagues, I caught, but when I got traded 
to the Pirates, they had quite a few catchers, so I consequently became an 
outfielder and utility player," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern continued, but the scenery changed. He was traded to the St. Louis 
Cardinals with left-handed pitcher John Tudor for outfielder George Hendrick 
and minor league catcher Steve Barnard before the '85 season. The Cardinals 
made it to the World Series that season and Harper had a pinch-hit RBI single 
off Kansas City Royal pitcher Charlie Leibrandt that broke a tie in Game Six of 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
But after hitting .250 in 52 at-bats, he was released. He played briefly with 
the Detroit Tigers and its minor league affiliate at Nashville in 1986 and with 
San Jose of the California League at the outset of '87 before his contract was 
purchased by the Oakland Athletics. For the remainder of the season, he played 
at Tacoma before he was promoted to the A's at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Harper wasn't certain what the future would bring. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that (a change of careers) might happen when I was in Tacoma," 
Harper said. "I was struggling there. In fact I got benched there, and I had 
never been benched in the minors before. So I got to thinking that I was pretty 
much finished. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to my wife and telling her that we might as well try to do 
something else. But she encouraged me not to quit, and then I really made some 
changes, during the next few days, in my priorities as far as what is more 
important. I realized that the Lord is more important and the family is more 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Harper's self-analysis came in June of that year, and he became a productive 
player the remainder of that season. 
</P>
<P>
"After I did that, I just started getting a hit every time up, just about, and 
finished the season really strong," he said. "In July and August I hit over 
.400. 
</P>
<P>
With his Tacoma average for the season at .310, he earned another promotion to 
the big leagues, playing briefly at the end of the season with the A's. 
</P>
<P>
But he was not protected by the A's after the season and was free to negotiate 
with any team. 
</P>
<P>
"I signed with the Twins because they said they'd let me catch," he said. 
"That's the biggest reason I didn't sign with Oakland; they really didn't 
consider me as a catcher. (The A's) thought of me as an outfielder, DH, 
whatever." 
</P>
<P>
He started the '88 season in the minors at Portland, where he had also played 
when the city's team was affiliated with the Pirates. He hit .353 in 46 games 
and was called up to the Twins. He hit .295 for the Twins in '88 and his 
success continued the following year and he became the starting catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota (40-44) went into Friday's action tied with the Angels for fifth 
place in the AL West. Harper had five home runs 36 RBIs and 32 runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said playing catcher also helps his hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"Catching does take its toll, but for me, catching helps my hitting," he said. 
"When I was playing in the outfield or (serving as) designated hitter, I 
thought too much about hitting. When I start thinking too much, I end up 
pressing and doing things I shouldn't do. But when I'm catching, I don't think 
a lot about hitting. So in the long run, it helps me relax more when I'm 
hitting. When I catch, I don't have to think about my last at-bat." 
</P>
<P>
The Twins' attitude also appeals to Harper. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the six major league teams I've been on, (Minnesota) by far has been the 
most relaxed," Harper said. "When I say relaxed, I don't mean lackadaisical, 
because its a very hard-working team, and plays as hard as any I've been on. 
But it's relaxed as far as (Manager) Tom Kelly and the coaches are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like that with all teams. Tom Kelly just says, 'Hey, do the best you 
can. That's all we ask.' That's helped me relax and feel more comfortable. On 
other teams, I felt that if I didn't get two or three hits in a game, I might 
not play for two weeks. So there was more pressing on other teams I played 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Harper knows he's a better player than at the start of his playing career. 
Maturity has made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively I wasn't ready when I was called up to the Angels," he said. "I 
was hitting real well in the minor leagues then, so I got rushed. I had a real 
good year in triple-A (1981) at the age of 20 or 21 hitting-wise, but 
defensively I wasn't ready to catch in the big leagues. Not too many 21 year 
olds are. I think that way it hurt me." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps family responsibilities along with the added years of experience have 
something to do with his maturity. The Harpers have a family to look after, 
with two sons, Brett, 9, and Derek, 6, an 11-year-old niece Aja, whom the 
Harpers are raising, and another child arriving soon.

DODD HAS A NEW PARTNER, OUTLOOK; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: SHE IS READY TO MAKE A RUN AT THE TOP AFTER WINNING PARTNERSHIP 
WITH SILVA ERODED.

Rumors and whispers. Back-stabbing. Successful marriages broken to pieces. 
Heroes and villains. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like a soap opera plot. 
</P>
<P>
But if you ask Manhattan Beach's Patty Dodd, it's the way of life on the 
women's professional beach volleyball tour. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Colombian-born Dodd, a five-year veteran of the booming circuit, has 
trouble keeping up with who's playing with who these days. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it 'As the Tour Turns,' " Dodd said. "We have girls who play one 
tournament with each other and then switch partners." 
</P>
<P>
Television revenue has driven up the purses on the women's tour. Consequently, 
the desire to win has increased dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
And players have begun shuttling around between partners, searching for that 
winning combination. 
</P>
<P>
"It's distracting, and in some ways I think it hurts the level of competition 
in the sport," Dodd said. "Players are looking for the right chemistry, but 
they're not staying together long enough to get to know their partners." 
</P>
<P>
Dodd, 26, finished her first week of practice with her new partner, six-foot 
Jeanne Reeves from Pacific Palisades. This weekend's John Shaw Open at 
Manhattan Beach will be the tandem's third tournament together. 
</P>
<P>
But having to break in a new partner wasn't Dodd's idea. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Dodd has found herself stumped by the Teammate Shuffle. When Jackie 
Silva -- the tour's No. 1 player -- dumped partner Janice Opalinski two weeks 
ago after a tournament in Fresno, Silva picked San Diego's Karolyn Kirby as her 
new teammate. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd had played with Kirby all season to that point. 
</P>
<P>
When Kirby phoned Dodd to break the news, Dodd's options were limited. A 
first-rate player herself, Dodd could have made some phone calls to some of the 
tour's hottest players -- Linda Chisholm-Carrillo, Kathy Hanley, Lori Kotas and 
Gail Castro among them. 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't think it was ethical to go to somebody whose team was already 
set," Dodd said. "The timing was just horrible." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she called Reeves, a former indoor teammate of Dodd's at UCLA, in the 
Italian professional league and in the erstwhile Major League Volleyball 
circuit with the Los Angeles Starlites. 
</P>
<P>
A rookie to the beach, Reeves is tall and quick, has a first-class serve and a 
solid all-around game. But it will take her a while to become comfortable with 
the strategies of the two-player beach game. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves is an assistant volleyball coach at UCLA and was busy on a recruiting 
trip when Dodd called. So the two played tournaments in Laguna Beach and 
Honolulu without practicing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at it as an investment in the future," Dodd said. "Jeanne's a 
rookie, but I think in the long run she's going to be as good as anyone." 
</P>
<P>
This month's switch wasn't the first time Dodd has been burned by partner 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she and Brazil's Silva were the tour's top team, winning 13 of 15 
tournaments. The low-key Dodd and the mercurial Silva had some personality 
conflicts, but there was no doubting the duo's success on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The fellow South Americans swept through the tour's early schedule, winning 
often and easily. They were still winning as the tour wound down, but the 
scores were becoming closer and Silva was growing increasingly frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
Silva dropped Dodd before the season's last event and won the finale with Rita 
Crockett-Royster. 
</P>
<P>
"We had different ways," Silva said. "It had gotten to the point where we 
couldn't talk, either on or off the court." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Dodd still hasn't gotten over that split. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, it really, really hurt," she said. "Even now, when I think about it, 
I'm still hurt. I mean, I see Jackie every weekend on the beach, and sometimes 
we play against each other." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Dodd has no hard feelings. She said she thinks she understands Silva's 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Dodd was getting involved with the politics of the women's tour, 
attending meetings of the Women's Professional Volleyball Assn. board. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd said that Silva might have become jealous of her partner's involvement 
with the board and might have felt that her interests weren't being met through 
Dodd's representation. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd also said that Silva -- who has won 17 of the tour's past 21 events 
despite having four different partners -- might have been motivated by a desire 
to be alone at the top. 
</P>
<P>
"When Jackie dumped me, we were tied for No. 1 in prize money and points," Dodd 
said. "By getting rid of me with one tournament left, she was No. 1 by 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
Dodd was able to recover from the blow by regaining a measure of success with 
Kirby and by falling back on the happiness of her three-year marriage with Mike 
Dodd, Manhattan Beach's veteran beach champion. 
</P>
<P>
Five-and-a-half years ago, at a weeklong U.S. Volleyball Assn. indoor 
tournament in New York, the lanky Mike Dodd approached the then-Patty Orozco to 
introduce himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a party-type atmosphere," Patty Dodd said. "There was a lot of 
socializing. After they were done playing, the guys would come out and look at 
the girls playing." 
</P>
<P>
The two began dating and were married two years later. The shared profession 
has made for a happy marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"On weekends, we're both traveling, so I'm not sitting at home waiting for Mike 
to come home," Dodd said. "Time goes by faster. Pretty soon, it's Sunday night, 
and we're looking forward to seeing each other at the airport. It's very 
healthy for the marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dodd's other passion is golf and his wife is thinking of buying a set of 
clubs to pursue that sport with him. The couple lived in Italy for eight months 
in 1985, where they played the indoor game, so Patty Dodd keeps her husband 
happy with her mastery of Italian and Colombian cooking. 
</P>
<P>
"He golfs, I cook," Dodd said. "He's not too picky about what he eats, so we 
stay happy." 
</P>
<P>
She was born Nubia Patricia Orozco, and she grew up in the quiet Bogota suburb 
of Santa Barbara, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
At 16, she was already a two-time most valuable player of the Colombian 
national volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Dodd considers Manhattan Beach her first home. But her family still 
lives in Colombia she often misses her homeland's tropical weather and the 
warmth and grace of its people. The Dodds will go to Colombia for Christmas 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Dodd doesn't miss her native country's problems with the cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
"It upsets me very much," she said. "I lived there for 17 years and I never saw 
cocaine in Colombia. But I have seen it here. The reason for all the problems 
there is because people are willing to buy the drug here." 
</P>
<P>
Dodd doesn't like what has happened to the fiber of Colombia's society because 
of cocaine trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"The value of life goes down," Dodd said. "People start fighting for territory 
and money. The very few get rich and everyone else gets poorer." 
</P>
<P>
She is considering an application for American citizenship this summer because 
her new home offers her comfort and security. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like an adopted Manhattan Beach person," Dodd said. "People respect each 
other more here because of the social laws and rules. I can walk on the street 
and not have to worry about having my purse snatched." 
</P>
<P>
For most of the year, Dodd teaches kindergarten to Hispanic youngsters at 
Felton Elementary School in Lennox. She knows three languages -- English, 
Spanish and Italian -- and is studying for her master's degree in special 
education at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, Dodd earned her bachelor's degree in psychology. She was also a 
two-time All-American in volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, she met Reeves. She's hoping that her new partner can help her 
find some stability in the soap opera swirl of today's beach tour. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to treat your partner just like a marriage, and stick with them 
through thick and thin," Dodd said. "People that originally teamed up could 
have been great if they would have just stuck together. You've got to give it a 
chance."

FOR HIM, THE HIGH OF JUMPING IS IN THE FUN

<P>
If a track meet were a day at school, Hollis Conway would be recess. Leave the 
mathematics of the high jump to the statistics freaks, the science to the 
coaches, the history to the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Conway simply wants to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
The night before he set the American high jump record last year at 7 feet 10 
inches, Conway couldn't sleep. Among world-class track athletes, this isn't an 
uncommon affliction. But with Conway, it wasn't from nerves or pressure or even 
indigestion. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed up all night playing video games," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Most athletes gear for big meets with a staff of coaches, trainers and workout 
partners. Conway has the Super Mario Brothers. "I like playing action games," 
he says. "If I play really well, I know my coordination is on. If I don't, the 
next day I'll be so clumsy, I'll stumble over a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Conway is easy to spot during a track competition. He's the one laughing and 
talking with anyone who will listen. But, as Emilio Estevez said in "Repo Man," 
track is intense. Sometimes, no one is willing to listen. So Conway finds ways 
to entertain himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes in competition, people don't like to talk and it gets boring," 
Conway says. "So I put on my Walkman and put on something fast. Nothing slow. 
Too slow and I get sleepy. I want something to wake me up. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't even have to hear it -- I'll sing. It'll sound bad, but I'll 
sing." 
</P>
<P>
Conway plays all the hits. Except for, maybe, Twitty. "Soul, R&amp;B, rap, 
whatever," he says. "When I'm over in Europe, I'll listen to MTV and when I 
come home, I'll be singing it. I'll sing anything I hear. You got to be 
versatile when you're over in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Conway can't relate to the track-and-field mind that is able to dissect the 
whole journey from approach to flop, visualizing it hundreds of times before 
the body is prepared to perfect it. 
</P>
<P>
Conway knows the object is to jump high. 
</P>
<P>
"I can never focus only on the high jump," he says. "When I'm out on the apron, 
it's just a matter of doing it. I can't see myself out there, thinking about 
every step for 2 1/2 hours. I'd be mentally drained." 
</P>
<P>
Even at that, however, Conway believes he thinks too much. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I could jump eight feet," he says, alluding to the current world's 
record held by Javier Sotomayor of Cuba. "The whole year, I train pretty hard 
and I get to a meet where I feel really good and I think, 'No, this is not the 
time.' 
</P>
<P>
"It was like that earlier with 7-10. 'What if I jump it too early in the year?' 
Who wants to jump 7-10 in March? 
</P>
<P>
"Then I get to the bar and say, 'Wait, I do," and by then, it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
The moral, according to Conway? 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to keep jumping and stop thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Conway, 23 going on 13, will try again in today's final afternoon of 
competition at the 1990 U.S. Olympic Festival. He says he's been clearing 7-8 
in practice "pretty easy" but is making no predictions about the real thing. "I 
don't know what to expect," he says, "but then, I never do." 
</P>
<P>
He reports that he is a little sore and suspects he's been overtraining. "My 
big problem is that after a hard practice session, I'll go play tennis for 
three hours. It's the extra stuff that wears me down." 
</P>
<P>
Conway also likes company when he trains. So he runs with the sprinters. "And I 
have to keep up with them," he says. Or, he will train with a few women 
distance runners. "I can't let any girls beat me," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Conway always has considered track and field a little too stiff in the collar, 
a little too stuffed in the shirt. The stopwatch-and-calculator crowd will tell 
you that Conway takes his sport less seriously than 99.125% of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Wind-aided or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I could ever be serious about it," Conway says. "Seriousness 
takes the fun out of it. If I got too serious, over the years, I might get 
tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, though, the coldness of the real world can't help but encroach on 
Conway's. Two weeks ago, on July 1, Pleas Conway, 61, died of a heart attack in 
Shreveport, La. 
</P>
<P>
Hollis Conway lost his father and his biggest fan. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad would watch me on TV," Conway said. "He'd save every article. If I wanted 
to keep good things in the paper, I had to win." 
</P>
<P>
Pleas also kept Hollis focused, or at least as much as humanly possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom and Dad both kept a lot of pressure on," Conway says. "They don't know 
much about track and field, but they wanted to see me win. I couldn't come home 
and say, 'It was cold, it was rainy.' They just wanted me to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, they'd be at one of my meets and they'd holler, 'Why didn't you 
make it?' It's a little embarrassing, people yelling out after you made a bad 
jump." 
</P>
<P>
Conway misses it already. 
</P>
<P>
"I still see him all the time, clearly, in my head," he says. "I don't know how 
it's going to affect me. It's the first time it's ever happened to me. It's 
weird." 
</P>
<P>
But at least, Conway says, his dad was able to make the trip to Seoul for the 
1988 Olympics. There, Pleas watched his son clear 7-8 3/4 and win a silver 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a stroke just before Seoul and the doctors were skeptical of letting 
him go," Conway says. "But they did let him go. He went to Seoul." 
</P>
<P>
And for that, Conway will be glad for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some fun."

REP. GONZALEZ: HE PACKS A PUNCH WHEN IT GETS TENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN ANTONIO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez slugged a knife-carrying man who called him a 
communist four years ago, it was nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Democrat once swatted a Republican House colleague for suggesting the 
same thing. And when Gonzalez's second grade teacher tried to wash his mouth 
out with soap for something he didn't do -- angrily declaring that she was 
"getting tired of little Mexicans" -- he smacked her, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not prone to violence," the 74-year-old, barrel-chested Gonzalez insisted 
the other night over a dinner of chicken, beans, squash and tortillas served by 
his wife, Bertha. "But I came up the hard way. I've had to face a tense 
situation time and time again." 
</P>
<P>
Though he hasn't thrown any punches lately, Gonzalez is proving to be a tough 
fighter and key player as Congress grapples with a tense situation of a 
different sort: trying to clean up the savings and loan mess, while staving off 
a similar collapse of banks. 
</P>
<P>
Since becoming chairman of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs 
Committee last year, Gonzalez has directed an extraordinary probe of the 
politically charged S&amp;L scandal -- including one brouhaha that led to the 
resignation of a top regulator and others that badly bruised five senators and 
Neil Bush, President Bush's son. 
</P>
<P>
He also was a leader in toughening legislation that is now being used to close 
failed thrifts and bail out depositors. Currently, he is working on an 
emergency overhaul of federal deposit insurance, aimed at keeping the 
multibillion-dollar thrift crisis from spreading. And he is managing a massive 
housing bill whose scope and expense are sure to provoke battles with both the 
President and the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In all of this, Gonzalez's performance has confounded his many critics and 
delighted his friends. For most of his 29 years in Congress, Gonzalez was 
widely dismissed as a liberal loner with a quixotic taste for pursuing hopeless 
causes -- a buffoon who couldn't control an assassination inquiry, an Uncle 
Tomas who was out of step with Latino militants and an eccentric who sometimes 
wore garish suits, made rambling speeches, told endless stories and -- yes -- 
even punched out an occasional critic. 
</P>
<P>
So far was he from being a member of the congressional insiders club that he 
twice had to overcome campaigns to deny him House committee chairmanships, 
first of a housing subcommittee and then of the full Banking Committee. Capitol 
Hill-watchers say the moves were inspired partly by lobbyists, who were worried 
that Gonzalez's independent streak would make him difficult to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, while losing none of his distinctive character or style, 
Gonzalez has begun to win the grudging respect of the critics. Which merely 
proves, say longtime friends, how much he was underestimated and misunderstood 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Friends remember his days as a San Antonio city councilman and Texas state 
senator, when they saw him as an eloquent, filibustering populist who throttled 
segregation measures and battled tax benefits for the rich. They recall him as 
a patently honest congressman who once stood alone among Texans in support of 
civil rights legislation and the New Frontier programs drafted by President 
John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
They also revere him as a visionary, an insatiable reader and student of 
history whose warnings of German resurgence and allegations of illegal U.S. 
military interventions may be validated over time. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the westside barrios here worship Gonzalez as an inspirational man of 
the people -- the American-born son of Mexican immigrants who clawed past 
discrimination barriers to a law degree and lawmaking; a big-shot who lives 
modestly, mixes warmly with common folk and heaps affection on his eight 
children and 20 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"In a number of homes, there are pictures of John Kennedy in one corner and 
Henry Gonzalez in the other, and in the middle is the Vision of Guadalupe with 
a candle," said Frank Herrera, chairman of the Mexican-American Legal Defense 
Fund. "Henry B. has almost saint-like status." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Gonzalez is admired for his fighting spirit in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll take on a Mexican-American or an Anglo indiscriminately, and he'll pull 
you out into the middle of the street in full sunshine," said Maury Maverick 
Jr., a liberal San Antonio newspaper columnist and former state legislator who 
once competed with Gonzalez in a run for governor. "He's meaner than a riled 
cat when he goes after you." 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Banking Committee, Gonzalez is credited with displaying 
fairness as well as toughness, in sharp contrast with his autocratic 
predecessor, Fernand J. St Germain (D-R.I.), who was defeated for reelection in 
1988 amid charges that he maintained improper financial ties to the savings and 
loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
"He started out as chairman saying he wanted to operate in a fair, bipartisan 
way as much as he could, and he certainly did that with the (S&amp;L bailout) 
legislation and also the housing bill," said Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie of Ohio, 
the top-ranking Republican on the 49-member committee. "He's kind of a 
let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may individual." 
</P>
<P>
Another Republican panel member, Rep. David Dreier of LaVerne, agreed. 
"Philosophically, we rarely see eye to eye, but Henry has always allowed me the 
opportunity to offer amendments," Dreier said. "He is very kind and generous." 
</P>
<P>
But the good feeling is not universal. Gonzalez has a feud going with Rep. 
Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) that began with his refusal to use the proxies of 
absent Democrats in favor of a Kennedy-sponsored amendment to an international 
banking bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my cool," Gonzalez conceded, referring to the run-in with the son of 
the late Robert F. Kennedy. But, he added: "Little Kennedy has a tendency to 
get excited." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Democrats complain that Gonzalez is too even-handed. They have 
pushed for the creation of a special committee that their colleagues could use 
during the election campaign to pile blame for the S&amp;L scandals on the 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"How are you going to get those damn Republicans?" Gonzalez said he was asked 
by Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski (D-Pa.) at one point. His answer: "I think you have 
to be down-the-middle and patient." 
</P>
<P>
With pressure mounting to contain the financial crisis, Gonzalez is mulling 
options to revamp the system under which deposits are federally insured up to 
$100,000. That system has been widely cited as a major factor in causing the 
S&amp;L crisis. He has not yet proposed a remedy, but he has decried the way 
the insurance limit was raised from $40,000 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never one minute's consideration or hearing on that increase," 
Gonzalez says. "It took minutes. There was no debate." 
</P>
<P>
As part of his own study of the matter, Gonzalez flew home over the Fourth of 
July congressional recess to solicit views from constituents. He makes such 
trips frequently, usually presiding at sessions in restaurants. His image is 
underscored by his unforgettable head: a magnificent landscape of cavernous 
eyes and mouth, mountainous nose, bushy eyebrows and deep, undulating facial 
creases. 
</P>
<P>
Over lunch with members of a business establishment that once virulently 
opposed him, Gonzalez heard warm words of support for his S&amp;L work. But the 
businessmen expressed concern that land values were being depressed and that 
credit is drying up because of new federal regulatory actions involved in the 
cleanup. "The backbone of the country" -- small business -- "is being crushed," 
developer Jack Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez responded quietly that "the S&amp;L crisis is really a symptom of a 
larger problem. Everybody is yelling: 'Pass a law, get the crooks.' But it's 
not that simplistic. The big issue is the insurance fund. We've simply got to 
find out how we got to the point we are today." He offered no immediate 
solutions, saying action probably would have to wait until a new Congress 
convenes in January. 
</P>
<P>
In conversations later, the businessmen praised Gonzalez's work and integrity. 
"He's done a good job establishing a forum in which everyone can be heard," 
said Gerry Solcher, a former S&amp;L president who lives near Gonzalez and 
often spots his neighbor mowing the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Added real estate executive Cliff Morton: "He damn sure researches his position 
before he jumps out on something. And you might be one of his closest friends, 
but if you are involved in something wrong, he is not going to cover for you. 
His ethics are impeccable." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez accepts relatively little campaign money from special-interest 
political action committees. The $215,000 that he has received over the last 
eight years is only one-seventh as much as Senate Banking Committee Chairman 
Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's assets are modest: a two-story brick house and a savings account 
with less than $2,500 in it, according to his financial disclosure report. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez cements the support that he gains on issues by paying close attention 
to local problems. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always fighting to get jobs here, especially at Kelly (Air Force Base) 
and Ft. Sam (Houston)," said Martin Trevino, a bus driver. Tito Chavarria, 
president of Alamo Technology, a defense contractor, lauded Gonzalez for 
swiftly helping his firm resolve a dispute with government auditors. And 
grocery wholesaler Wilson Toudouze said the congressman has "uncovered a lot of 
scandals" in Texas and Washington, and "we're hoping he gets some more big fish 
in the S&amp;L mess." 
</P>
<P>
There are dissenters, of course. Businesswoman Barbara Maras, suggesting that 
Gonzalez should be replaced, said: "With new blood comes new ideas. A few 
radical ideas couldn't hurt at this point." 
</P>
<P>
But Gonzalez has proved unbeatable, waltzing off with 71% of the vote two years 
ago. When he first ran for the House in a 1961 special election, though, he 
scraped by with only 55%. But it was an extraordinary victory: Gonzalez figures 
that less than 10% of the total came from Latino and black voters, who faced 
severe barriers at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
A colorful storyteller with near-total recall, Gonzalez relishes describing how 
Republicans tried to defeat him in that first race by bringing in former 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower to campaign at rallies where free tamales and 
beer were served. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring cries of panic from his family and staff, Gonzalez decided to "store 
my energy for a last push." Without telling anyone, he took a blanket, pillow, 
loaf of bread and book of poems to a hill north of town and camped out for two 
days while Ike created a sensation. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned, Gonzalez produced his friend, then-Vice President Lyndon B. 
Johnson, to endorse him for the congressional seat, declaring: "I'd rather have 
a live and kicking vice president campaign for me than a has-been President." 
</P>
<P>
And when he learned that Ike had flown into San Antonio on an oil-company plane 
and was staying at the home of an oil millionaire, the fiery populist had just 
the issue he needed. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, who proudly recalls his first grade teacher telling him he was "an 
American, not a Mexican," attributes his broad voter appeal in part to refusing 
to run on ethnic issues. He alienated Latino militants by opposing creation of 
a separate La Raza Unida party, and he stirred up friction by dropping out of 
the congressional Hispanic Caucus -- ostensibly in protest of the 
organization's fund-raising and dues-paying practices. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was more than that. "Isolating oneself in the tribe means 
strangulation," Gonzalez said in declaring his belief that Latinos should seek 
opportunity within the general framework of American society. 
</P>
<P>
In that context, Gonzalez's image has come a long way from the day in 1963 when 
he punched then-Rep. Ed Foreman (R-Tex.) for accusing him of being a "pinko" 
supporter of communist causes. Today, another conservative, Rep. Wylie of Ohio, 
considers Gonzalez a solid American. 
</P>
<P>
"He talks about his family a lot and that has a lot of appeal to me," Wylie 
said. "I think he has his head screwed on right as far as the values which make 
our country great are concerned."

THE STILLED VOICE THAT DROVE BEAT GENERATION IS HEARD AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jan Kerouac only met her father twice. The last time, in 1967, she was an 
adolescent; he was an alcoholic. She was longing to live; he was waiting to 
die. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had known him better," said Kerouac, now 38. "He could spout all 
kinds of things on paper, but in person, he was non-communicative. He was 
drinking out of a bottle of whiskey when I saw him, and he showed me artwork on 
his wall. He didn't know what else to say." 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, her father -- and the father of the Beat Generation, writer 
Jack Kerouac, only 47, drank himself to death. Jan Kerouac would know the 
legend, the books, the anecdotes -- never the man. Until today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like he's talking to me," said Jan Kerouac about the three-record 
Jack Kerouac Collection, distributed by Rhino Records on its new spoken-word 
label, Word Beat, and released in late June. "All these years later, I'm 
meeting him." 
</P>
<P>
The reunion was arranged by James Austin, Rhino's associate artists and 
recording director, who spent two often discouraging years hunting for the lost 
Kerouac recordings, and then acquiring ownership. The recordings, based on 
Kerouac's books and poetry, were made in 1958 and 1959, but very few copies 
were made. With the help of Kerouac contemporaries, such as poets Allen 
Ginsberg and Michael McClure, and Kerouac fans, such as record producer Harvey 
Kubernik, Austin put together a package revealing the writer's inexhaustible 
zest for all life experiences. 
</P>
<P>
In print, such exuberance was best manifested in "On the Road," the journey of 
Kerouac and his best friend, Neal Cassady, who drifted from city to city in 
search of life's heartbeat. On record, backed up by his favorite music, jazz 
and blues, Kerouac's words roll out with a thundering urgency, with passion and 
fire, as if there is no guarantee of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd read this stuff," said the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia, whose comments 
appear in a booklet accompanying the collection, "but I hadn't heard it -- the 
cadences, the flow, the kind of endlessness of the prose, the way it just 
poured off. It was really stunning to me. His way of perceiving the music and 
the road, the romance of the American highway, it struck me. It struck a primal 
chord." 
</P>
<P>
The Kerouac influence has been well documented. Bob Dylan credits Kerouac with 
turning him on to poetry. Ray Manzarek, The Doors' keyboardist, says the band 
would never have formed if not for the father of the Beat Generation. "We were 
fellow Beatniks," said Manzarek. "We wanted to live the life of freedom and 
credibility that he represented. Morrison and I talked about him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
After Kerouac's death in 1969, his torch didn't pass automatically to future 
generations. He had stayed away from the political and social changes of the 
1960s, which he had helped foster, and died almost in obscurity. Still, there 
were die-hards who kept the flame flickering, reading his works, discussing his 
message. Kubernik, who was producing other spoken-word albums in the late 
1970s, recalls that the questions about Kerouac never went away. 
</P>
<P>
"People wanted to know if Kerouac had made an album," Kubernik said. "I knew 
there was a market out there for this." 
</P>
<P>
Record executives didn't agree. When Kubernik, who was director of artists and 
recording for MCA Records, first pitched the idea of a Kerouac release in 1979, 
he was told a spoken-word album would have no marketability. "It was always 
dismissed as some sort of Harvey hobby. I had to educate people as to who this 
guy was." 
</P>
<P>
Periodically, for almost a decade, Kubernik, after leaving MCA, approached 
independent labels to see if there was any interest, but nobody made any 
offers. At the same time, Austin experienced his own frustrations. In 1975 he 
found that Kerouac had recorded albums, but couldn't locate any. "Everyone had 
tapes, but no one had the original albums." 
</P>
<P>
He joined Rhino Records in 1987, and, after launching other projects such as 
the Roy Orbison anthology, he made his first bid for the Kerouac release. He 
suggested a boxed set; Rhino executives agreed to one record. "At least they 
wanted to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Austin contacted Kubernik, head of BarkKubCo, a music and spoken-word 
production house, and together, they began lining up Kerouac friends and 
supporters. Austin was convinced that there was a market for the readings, and 
soon got Rhino to agree to the three-record release. "The fact that everything 
he wrote was still in print gave us the indication there was an audience out 
there for him." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he couldn't locate the original recordings, released by Hanover Records, 
which had gone out of business. Eventually he discovered that Roulette Records 
had possession of all Hanover material. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had found the Holy Grail," Austin said. "All this time, there was 
this cloud, and then it was suddenly lifted." 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, Rhino had just entered into negotiations to acquire the rights 
to Roulette's non-jazz catalogue, which included the Kerouac collection; they 
soon got it. Austin had secured the rights to two Kerouac albums, and got the 
third from PolyGram. 
</P>
<P>
Other Kerouac highlights, previously unreleased, such as his speech about the 
Beat Generation at Brandeis University and his appearance on "The Steve Allen 
Plymouth Show," were soon added to the three-record package. The set will cost 
$49.98 on CD, and $39.98 on record and cassette. Rhino is issuing 3,000 copies 
on CD, and 6,000 on both record and cassette. 
</P>
<P>
Kerouac friends and followers believe the writer would be pleased with the new 
release. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd love it," said McClure. "He was truly one of the great readers. I don't 
want to discount the page, but Jack lifted poetry from the page. It's the same 
thing that happens with rock 'n' roll. You now have a dialogue between the 
artist and the audience, and people can answer you back. He enjoyed the 
interaction with the audience." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Nicosia, who wrote a Kerouac biography, "Memory Babe," said Kerouac 
always predicted that he would become more famous after his death. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he'd want to be at the publicity party," said Nicosia, "and if 
he was, he'd be drunk at it." 
</P>
<P>
Nicosia said Kerouac's life was full of contradictions; he showed people the 
endless possibilities of adventure, of the ongoing search for answers on 
America's highways, and yet, he endured so many years of misery. 
</P>
<P>
"After 1957, there was almost no happiness in his life," Nicosia said, alluding 
to Kerouac's life of failed expectations. "He wanted to be seen as a voice of 
America, but instead was seen as a voice of juvenile delinquents, and that hurt 
him a lot. He was so angry and bitter, he wanted to die. He couldn't take the 
easy way, a bullet, because he was a Catholic. But he rationalized that it 
wasn't a sin if he drank himself to death." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Nicosia added, the Kerouac spirit that inspired so many youths in the 
1950s and 1960s to chart new, exciting courses in their lives can have as much 
relevance today. "It's a message that always needs to be heard, and that's why 
it's great that this set has been released. Life is to be experienced, and you 
can't just get it out of books or listen to what a teacher tells you." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Kerouac certainly followed in her father's footsteps. She has spent much of 
her life trailblazing across America and writing about it. She said that she 
has probably traveled more than 10 times as many miles as her father. "I have 
the same bug," she said. "I couldn't stop it." Her father's last words to her 
in 1967 still ring clearly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 15, and pregnant, and on my way to Mexico," she said, "and he said, 'You 
go to Mexico, and write a book about it, and you can use my name,' and that's 
what I did. It was called 'Baby Driver.' That was the closest he ever came to 
acknowledging that I was his daughter."

TONY SIRICO'S RAP SHEET: 28 ARRESTS AND 27 ACTING JOBS

<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Sirico loves his neighborhood. "I'd take this place over Beverly Hills any 
day," says the 45-year-old actor, driving his Chevy Malibu past the storefront 
pizzerias and candy stores in the sleepy district of Bensonhurst. "It's a good 
Italian neighborhood. You're part of something here." 
</P>
<P>
Just what you're part of isn't exactly clear, especially when a Times 
photographer asks Sirico to stop the car so she can take his picture by a 
charming neighborhood bistro. 
</P>
<P>
"Oooh, I don't know about that!" says Sirico, looking aghast. "Very important 
people hang out there. The most important people. You have to ask permission to 
take pictures." 
</P>
<P>
He laughs, a little nervously. "If you don't -- they'll eat your cameras." 
</P>
<P>
Sirico navigates a few blocks further and double parks his Malibu in front of 
Cafe Italia, another local eatery. "It's very Sicilian here," he explains 
mysteriously. "Very Sicilian. But I know the owner. Maybe he'll let us take 
pictures outside. Let me ask first. You gotta show respect. It means a lot 
around here." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the New York press has exaggerated the amount of underworld figures who 
reside here, Bensonhurst remains a tough, insular community. It gained more 
notoriety for the events surrounding the death of black teen-ager Yusuf 
Hawkins, who was killed in August by an angry white mob. 
</P>
<P>
Having lived here most of his life, after a childhood in nearby East Flatbush, 
Sirico knows the rugged nature of these isolated, clannish neighborhoods. 
"Where I grew up, every guy was trying to prove himself. You either had to have 
a tattoo or a bullet hole." 
</P>
<P>
Sirico grinned. "I had both." 
</P>
<P>
A handsome, olive-skinned man who has made a living for the past dozen years 
playing thugs and wise guys in small movie roles, Sirico had the perfect resume 
for a Hollywood gangster. 
</P>
<P>
He was a hoodlum. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested 28 times, first at the age of 7 for stealing nickels from the 
newsstand, Sirico built a formidable neighborhood reputation as a stick-up 
artist. He spent two stretches in prison, once on an illegal-weapon charge, 
once for armed robbery -- and was nabbed on innumerable occasions for 
disorderly conduct, robbery and other criminal offenses. 
</P>
<P>
"After all the times I was pinched, I knew every judge in town," says Sirico, 
immaculately dressed in a gray, pinstriped suit with a black silk shirt, black 
handkerchief and a pinkie ring the size of a walnut. "I was a tough kid. I 
always had that itch in my britches to find out who I was. I tested my 
(courage) every night. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a pistol-packing guy. The first time I went away to prison, they 
searched me to see if I had a gun -- and I had three of 'em on me. They'd ask 
why I was carrying and I'd say I live in a bad neighborhood. It was true. In 
our neighborhood, if you weren't carrying a gun, it was like you were the 
rabbit during rabbit-hunting season." 
</P>
<P>
During his last prison stay in the early 1970s, Sirico saw a performance by a 
group of ex-con actors. Having already honed his thespian skills standing in 
police lineups and chatting up precinct captains ("I got 28 arrests and only 
two convictions, so you gotta admit I have a pretty good acting record"), the 
event inspired him. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched 'em and I thought, 'I can do that.' I knew I wasn't bad looking. And 
I knew I had the (guts) to stand up and (bull) people. You get a lot of 
practice in prison. I used to stand up in front of these cold-blooded murderers 
and kidnapers -- and make 'em laugh." 
</P>
<P>
He wagged his finger. "It wasn't easy. The only way you could make most of 
these guys laugh was to stick a gun in their ribs and tell 'em, 'Laugh or I'll 
kill you.' " 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a photographer pal at the New York Daily News, Sirico got work 
as a model and quickly graduated to small-time acting gigs. His first speaking 
role was in "Godfather II," where he and then-unknown Danny Aiello played the 
Rosato Brothers ("The first words I said on screen were, 'There's a cop!' "). 
Since then, Sirico has acted in 27 movies (including "Cookie" and "Love and 
Money"), assorted TV episodes, a Coke commercial and appeared as a model in 
such magazines as Cosmopolitan, Oui and True Detective. 
</P>
<P>
In Martin Scorsese's upcoming "Good Fellas," he plays Frankie (The Wop) Basil, 
a stylish enforcer who punishes rival mobsters by sticking their heads in 
ovens. In James Toback's "The Pick-Up Artist," he was partners with Harvey 
Keitel in an Atlantic City casino. And in the Coen Brothers' forthcoming 
"Miller's Crossing," he's Patsy Ketti, a demolition man who takes special 
pleasure in blowing up saloons. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony is really one of a kind," says writer-director James Toback, who has made 
him part of his stock company. "I look at him as being George Raft -- but with 
a little more menace. He has that great combination of real-life authenticity 
and acting craft. And a very mischievous smile. Everything I write seems real 
when he speaks the lines. Now when I start a new movie I automatically think, 
'What do I have for Tony?' " 
</P>
<P>
Relaxing in his home, which he shares with his mother, Sirico is a zestful 
storyteller with the smooth patter of a card shark and the irresistible charm 
of a reformed wise guy. Sipping chilled wine ("My brother, the priest, brought 
it by"), he keeps some of his best tales off-the-record, no doubt because many 
of his unsavory old pals are still on the prowl. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to emphasize the confidential nature of these anecdotes, he cheerily 
warns: "You write about that and I'll have to come looking for you in 
California. As a matter of fact, I'll make a phone call and have someone bring 
you back here." 
</P>
<P>
In his neighborhood, Sirico is a celebrity. To the rest of the world, he's 
still a minor character actor, even if he's shared scenes with everyone from 
Dennis Hopper to Harvey Keitel and Gabriel Byrne. As he succinctly puts it: 
"I'm no (obscenity) Laurence Olivier, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
By Sirico's own estimate, he's died in 13 of his 27 films ("and that's not 
counting the ones I was wounded in"). At his home, he has a fuzzy videotape of 
his climactic demise in Toback's cult-favorite film, "Fingers." It's a brutal 
scene where Sirico and Keitel, stabbing and pulverizing each other in a blood 
fury, go tumbling down 40 feet of stairs before Keitel finishes off Sirico for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Sirico wagged his head. "Yeh, when my mother saw that stuff, she had enough. 
She walked out of the theater." He shrugged. "I make a pretty good living 
because I die well. I get hired to get killed." 
</P>
<P>
If Olivier was unrivaled as a master of the soliloquy, then Sirico is an expert 
in the art of death throes. "The most important thing is you gotta know how to 
sell it," he says. "I can walk on my knees, hit the floor and then get back up 
and die. Or I can weave around and then go down. I did this one movie with 
Ruben Blades called 'The Last Fight.' When I got shot in the head, I went down, 
down on my knees and as the camera pulled in close to me, I crossed my eyes and 
then I died." 
</P>
<P>
Sirico flashes that mischievous smile. "Oh, it was wonderful. The effect, just 
for that moment, was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
As a wise guy, Sirico drew on various acting skills, dressing up for his armed 
robberies the way an actor gets made-up for a new part. 
</P>
<P>
"When I would rob a place I'd be mustached up, wigged up -- everything," he 
explains, pouring another glass of wine. "I'd wear brown wigs. Blond wigs. In 
fact, I got busted 'cause I was wearing the wrong wig. 
</P>
<P>
"I stuck up this place in a blond wig and blond mustache. I got 30 grand, 
'cause they were making great money. So I come back the next week -- and I'm 
such an idiot that I forgot what wig I'd been wearing. So I come in wearing the 
same blond wig and -- boom -- they welcomed me with open arms and open 
handcuffs!" 
</P>
<P>
Sirico's obsession with style almost got him killed. One night, resplendent in 
a new white suit, he was smooching with a girl on a local church steps when a 
rival hood spotted him and shot Sirico -- once in the leg, once in the back. It 
wasn't an entirely unprovoked attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kissing his girl," Sirico sheepishly acknowledges. "These three guys 
from the Bronx drive up and said, 'Hey Junior!,' which was my nickname. And I 
was in no position to do anything, because I have my tongue deep down in her 
soul. So they go, 'Boom!' And shoot me in the leg. When I saw the blood all 
over my new white suit, I just went crazy. So instead of running away, I start 
running toward their car! 
</P>
<P>
"All I could think of was how they ruined my suit. Luckily, they stepped on the 
gas and pulled away. But as soon as I turned around, they shot me again, this 
time in the back." 
</P>
<P>
It should come as no surprise that one of Sirico's heroes was James Cagney, the 
actor who lent his sleek style to decades of gangster myths. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, Junior was a genuine tough guy," says James Caan, who's known Sirico 
for nearly a decade and shares many "mutual friends" from his old neighborhood. 
"But in a funny way, now that he's straight, he can behave like a wise guy. 
He's been able to romanticize his past, throw in a few bangles and sparkles and 
use it as an actor. What you see is really him -- he just adds a little pepper, 
a little cayenne, to spice it up." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Caan cites his first meeting with Sirico, who came to watch the 
actor coach his son's Little League team. "It was 105 degrees and everyone was 
in cut-offs," recalls Caan. "And here's this guy dressed in a three-piece suit, 
with these fancy kickers (expensive shoes) and a year's supply of VO-5 on his 
head. He was so formal and proper it was hilarious. He actually told me he'd 
come to pay his respects. Junior turned out to be a genuinely good guy, but at 
the time all I could think was, 'This guy is right out of 'The Godfather!' " 
</P>
<P>
So how did Sirico fall into a life of crime -- and finally find redemption? He 
traces his troubles to the wild impulses of an unstable youth -- and to the 
temptations of the opposite sex. In his early 20s, married and already a 
father, he fell for a beautiful neighborhood girl. 
</P>
<P>
"My life was wrecked," he says softly, massaging his temples. "I mean wrecked. 
I forgot I had a wife. A pregnant wife. I forgot I had kids. All I could see 
was this girl's face. And what a face. I was madly in love." 
</P>
<P>
Eager to impress his paramour, he started to cut corners. "I was very unstable. 
I wasn't thinking right. So I hooked up with these guys and all of a sudden I'm 
a stick-up artist. I stuck up every nightclub in New York." 
</P>
<P>
He fingered the cross around his neck. "I keep this thing on, just in case." He 
smiled. "I'm no angel. I'm a little tarnished, but I'm no low-life. Whatever I 
did, I was always a stand-up guy. If you had a problem, at 5 a.m., you could 
call me and I'd come down, give you a hand and say, 'OK, who's bothering you? 
I'll help you take care of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, when Sirico broke the law, he went to prison. After six months, and no 
visits from his girlfriend, the spell was broken. "I deserved the punishment I 
went through," he says. "For what I did -- and for leaving my wife -- I 
deserved more than that. But finally I got her out of my head. I just woke up 
and wasn't thinking about her anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Sirico says he's found satisfaction -- and self-respect -- as an actor. "I like 
myself," he says. "I feel good about what I've accomplished. I came from 
another world -- and now I'm an actor. Not a big-shot star, but a legitimate 
actor." 
</P>
<P>
But memories of his old life die hard. "I gotta admit I feel funny when 
somebody will spot me and ask for an autograph," he says. "I think it's that 
old guilt. Maybe I feel like I don't deserve the attention." 
</P>
<P>
Sirico takes a final sip of wine and shows off pictures of his brothers, one 
who's the priest, the other who's a stockbroker. "I'm proud of what I do. I 
remember when I got that first part in 'The Godfather,' and Coppola told me I 
was a real character, with a line of dialogue and everything." 
</P>
<P>
He grins, ferociously. "Oh, let me tell you. I was strutting. I was thinking, 
'I got a name. I got a name!' "

<P>
LAST YEAR, WHEN the Berlin Wall fell and the word reunification was murmured in 
the halls of power, the American Jewish community held its breath. Nobody had 
to be reminded of what happened to European Jewry the last time Germany was 
one. Reluctant to risk sparking world ire by opposing reunification while 
television transmitted dramatic pictures of the decimated Berlin Wall, most 
American Jews were content to let the British, French, Poles and Soviets 
express concern on their own behalf. Not so Rabbi Marvin Hier. The 51-year-old 
dean and founder of The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles quickly fired 
off a missive to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl articulating his own fears, 
and those of the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
"I must tell you I am not among those in the cheering section applauding the 
rush towards German reunification. . . . You are undoubtedly aware, Mr. 
Chancellor, the great fear that German reunification brings to the community of 
victims of Nazism. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl responded, albeit coolly. "The vast majority of young people in Germany 
are fully aware of the inestimable value of a free democracy. . . . Relentless 
political measures to combat right-wing extremism will continue in a united 
Germany. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hier wasted no time offering the exchange of letters to the New York Times, 
turning Kohl's response into a public statement of political policy, putting 
The Wiesenthal Center on the front page once again and, not incidentally, 
making Hier himself look like the leader of American Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
Which he may well be. By concentrating on the Holocaust and hyping the threat 
of anti-Semitism, Hier has, in the span of 13 years, turned his brainchild, The 
Wiesenthal Center, into the fastest growing, highest-profile Jewish activist 
organization in the world today. He has certainly become America's most 
fearless public enemy of aging Nazis, youthful neo-Nazi skinheads and those 
Jewish soft-headed naifs who don't perceive anti-Semitism an as imminent 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
Through the center's offices in Toronto, Paris and Jerusalem, Hier keeps an 
endless vigil against anti-Semitism in world politics, international business 
and even rap lyrics: It was Hier's second-in-command, Rabbi Abraham Cooper, who 
last year condemned Professor Griff of the rap group Public Enemy for its 
pronounced anti-Semitism and gave its leader Chuck D. a much-publicized tour of 
the center's Holocaust Museum. This year, The Wiesenthal Center forced various 
European airlines, including Air France and British Air, to stop omitting 
Israel from the maps they had printed for their Middle East in-flight 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
Even more celebrated is the center's pursuit of former Nazis. Last year, it was 
instrumental in the capture of former S.S. officer Josef Schwammberger in 
Argentina. Hier was credited with bringing world attention to Raoul Wallenberg, 
the Swedish diplomat who had selflessly rescued thousands of Hungarian Jews 
during World War II. Hier and his center were also key figures in last year's 
protest against the location of a Carmelite convent at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Hier's attentions have been focused on the increasing incidents 
of anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe; the center has people in various countries 
working to separate fact from rumor. After a trip to Poland a few weeks ago, 
Hier met with Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel to discuss Jewish 
concerns. Havel assured Hier that he considered the apparent resurrection of 
anti-Semitism "a plague and a scourge" and pledged to do what he could to quell 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In the process of gaining such influence and prestige, Hier has stepped on more 
than a few toes. An Orthodox rabbi from New York's Lower East Side, he came to 
Los Angeles in 1977, by way of Vancouver, to build a yeshiva. What this city 
got instead was a world-renowned Jewish-defense agency. And, whether it likes 
it or not, Los Angeles also got Hier, a shrewd and canny operator who, in his 
subsequent pursuit of success and power, has managed to alienate many of the 
city's established Jewish organizations, including the Jewish Federation 
Council, the umbrella organization for the city's Jewish agencies, and the 
B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
Hier is an anomaly within the Los Angeles Jewish scene. He is Orthodox where 
most leaders are assimilated. He is confrontational where they are loath to 
publicly acknowledge discord; Hier will speak out against his own in the 
mainstream press while other Jewish leaders prefer to voice their differences 
only within the community. He is cantankerous and blunt where most are 
polished, street-wise and suspicious where many are reserved. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very naively optimistic," says Hier of his fellow Jews. "We're always 
looking for the sunshine. Jews say they feel so secure in America. This is such 
a wonderful country -- and it is. But they have lost all touch with reality. 
Things could change." 
</P>
<P>
Most important, Hier remains unfettered by the bureaucracies that keep the 
others hidebound; he plays by his own rules. And his marked Lower East Side 
accent, his Orthodox regalia and his refusal to bow to secular trends make him 
a constant reminder of exactly what many local Jewish leaders, with their tans 
and Southern California cadence, wanted to escape when they, or their 
predecessors, moved west. 
</P>
<P>
"Marvin Hier and the center will always cry anti-Semitism," says a renowned 
scholar whose previous criticism of Hier's use of the Holocaust drew Hier's 
wrath. "And they always make sure their name is spelled right." 
</P>
<P>
Yet he has apparently become something of a folk-hero among the city's 700,000 
Jews; the center is perpetually deluged by $10 donations from even the most 
non-observant. Last year, when many other Jewish organizations had to cut 
corners and go begging, the center pulled in $9.7 million in contributions, and 
another $5.3 million for its new Museum of Tolerance (scheduled to open next 
year adjacent to the center on Pico Boulevard). And Hier has powerful friends 
who might withhold their significant contributions to many of the city's other 
Jewish organizations if they felt it would benefit, or avenge, him. Hier knows 
this. In all these ways, he has used his muscle to become one of the most 
imposing figures in world Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
"Rabbi Hier," says Israel Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, "is one of the 
foremost spiritual leaders in the United States, and in the entire Jewish 
world." 
</P>
<P>
THE TENSION BETWEEN Hier and the Jewish Federation Council reached new heights 
last November when Prime Minister Shamir refused to reschedule his visit to Los 
Angeles after he was told that federation bigwigs would be out of town. But 
Shamir made time for Hier; the two had a two-hour heart-to-heart schmooze in 
Hier's study. The symbolic blow was soon returned. A few months later at 
federation headquarters, former federation president Stanley Hirsch buttonholed 
David Peleg, a high-ranking official from the Israeli Embassy in Washington, 
who had just finished briefing ranking members on "the Situation" in Israel. 
According to several onlookers, including former Anti-Defamation League 
executive Hyman H. Haves, an angry Hirsch loudly protested Shamir's scheduling, 
insulted the prime minister's height and said, in effect, that the next time 
Shamir wanted contributions or financial support, he could forget the 
federation and go straight to his friend Hier. (Peleg confirms there was a 
public disagreement; Hirsch denies being there.) 
</P>
<P>
Never has anyone with such genius for publicity headed a Jewish organization in 
Los Angeles. Hier, a slight, dark-suited, fedora-donning rabbi, has regularly 
pulled end-runs around the city's established Jewish agencies and 
organizations. Hier has accrued unprecedented clout in the Legislature, on 
Capitol Hill, in the city's boardrooms and even in Hollywood. He has so 
effectively mastered the art of headline-grabbing that the federation, insiders 
say, has trouble getting comparable publicity, even from its own house organ, 
The Jewish Journal. 
</P>
<P>
"Success is not a crime," says Hier. "It's not a sin to be successful. My style 
is you take a point of view. The worst thing in the world is to go to a 
football game and see both teams refuse to move off the 50-yard line. You'll 
leave after five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
He ignores all charges of sensationalism and designs the center's fund-raising 
mailings with great marketing savvy. A typical piece notes that the head of a 
little-known Canadian fringe party seeks a "constitutionally racist state," a 
rock concert involving neo-Nazis and skinheads held near London included a song 
denying the existence of the Holocaust and a Cairo newspaper alleges that 
Israel is exporting AIDS to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone appreciates Hier's tactics. Some accuse him of throwing oil on the 
flames of anti-Semitism to scare people into opening their wallets to The 
Wiesenthal Center. Hier, however, cares little about community approval. Though 
Orthodox in his religion, he employs highly unorthodox tactics, including 
riding roughshod over the established channels and methods of the Jewish 
community. He openly courted Republicans before it was fashionable in Jewish 
circles -- to Hier, political party is incidental, recognition for his center 
is everything. He voted for Ronald Reagan for President, Tom Hayden for the 
Assembly. He even cultivated a friendship with Menachem Begin when the former 
Israeli prime minister was still considered tref, or unclean. 
</P>
<P>
He also has no compunction about asking government officials for funding, which 
many Jewish leaders view as a step toward a dangerous marriage of church and 
state. Five years ago, when The Wiesenthal Center received $5 million from the 
California Legislature for its $46.7-million Museum of Tolerance, several 
Jewish leaders complained bitterly -- but not publicly. (The center will also 
receive $5 million from Washington, through legislation sponsored in the House 
of Representatives by Democratic Congressman Henry A. Waxman.) 
</P>
<P>
Politicians eager to capture Jewish votes and money regularly visit the center 
-- in recent years the center's guest book has been signed by President Bush, 
Sen. Ted Kennedy, gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson and 
other luminaries. The massive federation headquarters is all but ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"They talk about a recent improvement in relations," says the liaison to the 
Jewish community for a prominent legislator, "but I can tell you that Hier, the 
federation and the ADL (B'nai Brith's Anti-Defamation League) are still at each 
other's throats, no holds barred." 
</P>
<P>
HIER WAS BORN with the soul of an activist. Since he was child, he dreamed of 
taking revenge upon the Nazis who wiped out most of his parents' families in 
Poland. For Hier -- as for most Jews -- the Holocaust was the searing event of 
the 20th Century. But later, as a student of history, he saw the Nazis' war on 
European Jewry as part of a horrific pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember thinking about the Book of Esther, the story of the first genocide 
-- Haman's plot to destroy the Jews. I was always fascinated by the historical 
validity of that narrative -- how it repeats itself in generation after 
generation," he says. "There was always a plotter out there who wanted to 
destroy the Jews." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Holocaust survivors and authors Elie Wiesel and Primo Levi, Hier's tools 
are not pen and paper but museums, speeches and movies. In 1982, he won an 
Oscar for "Genocide," a documentary about the Holocaust, narrated by Orson 
Welles and Elizabeth Taylor, that he co-authored with distinguished British 
historian Martin Gilbert. (Hier accepted the award wearing his yarmulke.) Hier 
trades on emotion, not intellect. He realizes that the center's vast majority 
of members are not steeped in the culture and traditions of Jewish life. To get 
people to pay attention to his battle against anti-Semitism, Hier refuses to 
let anyone forget the Holocaust even for a moment. For Marvin Hier, it is 
simply "the minimum where otherwise unaffiliated Jews weigh in." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad fact," adds Hier's chief financial backer, Canadian financier Sam 
Belzberg, "that Israel and Jewish education and all the other familiar 
buzzwords no longer serve to rally Jews behind the community. The Holocaust, 
though, works every time." 
</P>
<P>
Hier gives the Holocaust a uniquely California spin. He likens the potential of 
another such cataclysm to predicting earthquakes. "If you chart the history of 
earthquakes," he says, "you find that some are more severe than others. You 
also recognize that they are not freak accidents. No one would conclude that we 
shouldn't have any research into earthquake prediction, or that we shouldn't 
prepare ourselves for the possibility that there might be another." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Hier has dedicated himself to, among other things, Nazi hunting. 
In 1979, when the center was in its infancy, Hier successfully lobbied West 
Germany to rescind a proposed statute of limitations on the prosecution of Nazi 
war criminals. Since then, the center has forced the Canadian government to set 
up systems for pursuing resident ex-Nazis and other war criminals. And he has 
urged identical legislation in Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. He was 
also instrumental in publicizing and promoting the career of Viennese 
Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal. "Before meeting up with Hier," says one 
Wiesenthal Center insider, "Simon was nickel and diming it in Vienna. He 
couldn't even pay his phone bills." 
</P>
<P>
In the deadly serious business of protecting Jews around the world, Hier is an 
affable, charming activist. He can seem quite childlike -- offering Cokes and 
candy to important visitors -- and, when not battling anti-Semites, he follows 
his beloved Chicago Cubs on his office TV. He and his wife, Marlene, an urban 
planner who is director of membership for the center, live in West Los Angeles, 
in Beverlywood. His oldest son, Ari, 26, was just appointed director of the 
Hillel Student Union at USC. Avi, 25, is a vice president at Baer, Stearns, a 
stock-trading house. 
</P>
<P>
And despite his mission, "Moish," as Hier's friends call him, doesn't always 
take himself too seriously -- at a 50th birthday party for Bill Belzberg, Sam 
Belzberg's brother, the good rabbi jumped out of a cake. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Berenbaum, project director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 
Washington, believes that the style and message of "Genocide" are completely 
indicative of Hier. " 'Genocide ' is a substantive piece of work," Berenbaum 
says. "But watching it is like sitting in a dentist's chair where the drill 
begins at the first moment and doesn't let up till the end of the two hours. If 
it had, it might have been more effective. In a real sense, that is Marvin 
Hier." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Berenbaum has nothing but praise for the man's achievements. "Hier has 
essentially taken what could have been regarded as a small, parochial, 
peripheral institution and transformed it into the largest single membership 
organization in American Jewish life." 
</P>
<P>
For the 380,000 families worldwide who support the center with their 
contributions, Hier is refreshing. They cheer his abrasive public manner, his 
fondness for confrontation and hyperbole, his doom-and-gloom pronuncimentos and 
even his lapses into Holocaust shtick: For example, Hier returned from a visit 
to the site of the Treblinka death camp in Poland bearing ash-covered stones 
uncovered in a field. "Moish used to shlep those stones around on satin 
pillows," a Hier intimate says. "He was perfectly sincere, but it was awfully 
kitsch." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a ballsy little guy," says producer Dan Curtis, who raves about Hier's 
creative input into his acclaimed TV miniseries, "War &amp; Remembrance." "He 
hangs in there; he's tougher than hell, and he won't take bull from anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Simon Wiesenthal is even more effusive. "He's dynamite," says Wiesenthal, in 
his broken English, from his home in Vienna. "The man is never quiet. He is 
always trying to do things no one else has ever tried. I know that he makes 
other Jewish organizations nervous. This center is young and aggressive. I hope 
this aggressivity will survive me." 
</P>
<P>
By all indications, it will. In fact, the center's newest project, designed by 
James Gardner (who also designed The Museum of Diaspora in Tel Aviv), is rising 
now on Pico Boulevard. The Hebrew name of The Museum of Tolerance is Beit 
Ha'Shoah -- the House of the Holocaust. However, its focus will extend, in 
substance and appeal, beyond the Holocaust and document other genocides, 
including those of the Cambodians and the Armenians. As planned, the first 
floor of the museum will trace the history of racism and prejudice in the 
United States and relates the story of the Holocaust. The second floor will 
have a bank of 33 interactive computer consoles linked to videodiscs 
containing, among other resources, the center's newly published, four-volume 
"Encyclopedia of the Holocaust." The third floor will include a 324-seat 
theater that will regularly show motion pictures relevant to the themes of the 
museum. The museum will also house one of the country's most complete Holocaust 
archives, containing 500 hours of videotaped interviews with survivors, 
liberators and others, and 1,200 archival collections of historical documents, 
correspondence, photographs, diaries and artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Hier intends the museum to become a tourist attraction. 
This is not, he insists, a place just for Jews. "Hatred did not die in the 
bunker with Hitler," he says. "These are not dinosaurs that you can walk away 
from at the Museum of Natural History and then forget about. The haters are 
still among us." 
</P>
<P>
THE SON OF a Polish immigrant lamp polisher who arrived in the United States on 
the White Star ship in 1917, Hier was not always eager to take on the world's 
assorted Jew-haters and baiters. Certainly not in New York, where he was raised 
in the city projects. Young Hier spent his early life within three 
circumscribed blocks along Cannon Street, his birthplace, among, he recounts, 
largely "Sabbath-observant look-alikes and think-alikes." 
</P>
<P>
He was studious, not a street fighter. "I'd like to claim that when we were 13 
or 14, we fought back. But when the gangs (from other neighborhoods) pounced on 
us," he says, "we just ran." 
</P>
<P>
Hier did well in school. Soon after he was ordained at the Rabbi Jacob Joseph 
Theological Seminary, his teachers recommended him to an emissary from the 
fledgling Jewish community in Vancouver, Canada, who had come to New York 
looking for someone to take over the city's premier Orthodox synagogue. For the 
newly married 22-year-old rabbi and his 19-year-old wife, swapping the insular 
streets of their neighborhood for Canada's lush and laid-back Pacific Coast was 
like moving to the moon. But Hier was adventuresome, and discouraged at the 
prospect of achieving prominence in New York's long-established Jewish 
community. For Hier's Yiddish-speaking father, who had never heard of Canada, 
the move was incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
"My father did not know geography very well," recalls Hier. "When I told him I 
was going to Vancouver, he thought I told him I was going to 'Van-Cuba.' He 
said, 'What Jewish boy goes to a communist country?' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, some 7,500 Jews lived in Vancouver. In salmon-rich British Columbia, 
these truly were bagel-and-lox Jews: They drove to shul on the Sabbath, in 
violation of strict Jewish law; most did not keep kosher homes, and 
intermarriage was not uncommon. Other Orthodox rabbis would have been dismayed 
at this lack of piety. Hier saw opportunity. As rabbi of Congregation Schara 
Tzedek, Hier discovered a facility for inspiring young people. It dawned on him 
that through the synagogue youth movement he could reshape the lives of all his 
congregants. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Belzberg was one of Hier's first disciples. A child of startling 
self-assurance, Marc would become scion of a financial empire that grew out of 
the furniture business that his grandfather, Abraham, had established in 
Edmonton. He would also become Hier's inside track to Sam Belzberg, Marc's 
father and the man who would make The Wiesenthal Center financially possible. 
</P>
<P>
When Hier met Marc, Sam and Fran Belzberg were happily non-observant newcomers 
to Vancouver. Because of Marc's fascination with Hier, however, the curious 
Belzbergs joined Hier's congregation. But they became angry and perplexed with 
the boy's sudden and forceful swing toward Orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Belzberg's distress over her son's religiosity grew daily. And soon her 
other children, under Marc's influence, began to fall into strict religious 
observance "like dominoes." "Travel was especially tough," she recalls. "We'd 
go to Maui, and I'd have to bring along 50 pounds of kosher meat." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Fran's demands that Hier stop "brainwashing" the children of the 
community, the Belzbergs eventually warmed to Hier. In the Canadian business 
community, the Belzbergs were outsiders with a seldom-appreciated instinct for 
making profitable corporate acquisitions. Hier, too, was an outsider. The 
couples became friends. 
</P>
<P>
When Hier began to engage in open political activism, Belzberg was his most 
fervent supporter. Vancouver Jews were alarmed at Hier's outspokeness, 
especially at the spectacle Hier provided to Soviet Prime Minister Alexei 
Kosygin in 1975: When Kosygin arrived at the Vancouver Hotel, Hier, with the 
city's Reform and Conservative rabbis, all replete in prayer shawls and 
tefillin, or phylacteries, greeted him with loud prayers for the consolation of 
their oppressed Jewish brethren in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Hier was hobnobbing with royalty, but even then on his own terms. On one 
occasion there was a noted Jewish Canadian jurist who took issue with Hier over 
the yarmulke he insisted on wearing at a Victoria reception for Queen Elizabeth 
and Prince Phillip. To his dismay, the royal couple was captivated by the head 
covering, engaged Hier and his wife in friendly conversation and ignored the 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975 Hier took a year's sabbatical in Israel. There, he encountered the Or 
Same'ach ("happy light") Yeshiva in Jerusalem. Or Same'ach's scouts used to 
scour the city for the many young, disheveled Jewish Westerners who flocked to 
Israel during their travels. They would bring them to the yeshiva where the 
youths would be bombarded with Sabbath good feeling and haimishness. Eventually 
many would enroll as students, and some would become ba'alei tshuva (newly 
observant Jews). 
</P>
<P>
It occurred to Hier that if the key to spreading Orthodox Jewish observance was 
young people, then he was wasting his time in Vancouver, where he was preaching 
to the converted -- the same people who flocked to his synagogue week after 
week. When Hier returned home in September, it struck Sam Belzberg that the 
fire had disappeared. Belzberg decided the man needed a drink and a sympathetic 
ear and invited him into his study. "Hier said, 'I don't drink,' " recounts 
Belzberg. "I said, 'You'll have one anyway.' " He drank. And Belzberg heard his 
story. Los Angeles, said Hier, was becoming a vibrant center for Jewish life. 
And that's where he wanted to move. 
</P>
<P>
Hier and Belzberg flew to Los Angeles in early 1977, where they quickly 
snatched up the old Reiss-Davis Center building on Pico Boulevard; real estate 
maven Joe Tannenbaum of Toronto had agreed to match Belzberg's 
half-million-dollar contribution to open a West Coast branch of Or Same'ach. 
</P>
<P>
Word quickly reached the ears of Rabbi Maurice Lamm, then head of the Beth 
Jacob Congregation of Beverly Hills, the largest Orthodox synagogue in the 
western United States. He reportedly got his brother Norman Lamm, president of 
Yeshiva University in New York, to call Hier and offer an affiliation with 
Yeshiva University. L.A.'s nascent Orthodox community was virtually kvelling 
that, finally, there would be an Orthodox college for their children. Hier was 
equally delighted, having unexpectedly upgraded his operation from a yeshiva to 
a university affiliate called Yeshiva University at Los Angeles (YULA). 
</P>
<P>
HIER DROVE TO LOS Angeles with his wife and two young sons in July, 1977. 
During the course of the summer, Hier enlisted real estate developers Roland 
Arnall and Esther Cohen, who became his lay leaders, and Mara Kochba, a native 
New Yorker who had worked in communal public relations and fund-raising. With 
Sally Arnall and Marlene, they sat in the courtyard of Hier's rundown building 
and planned a fund-raising banquet. A cursory glance at the calendar revealed 
that Nov. 12 -- the date of the banquet -- was the anniversary of 
Kristallnacht, the Nazi's first pogrom. Upon discovering this, Hier chortled 
with childlike glee. "We're in business," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the next month that the idea for a commemorative museum for the 
Holocaust with a strong activist, Jewish-defense orientation jelled. Then, 
while planning the banquet Hier proposed honoring Simon Wiesenthal. Hier and 
his associates realized that if they could convince Wiesenthal to back their 
efforts, they could have both a school and a center. With characteristic 
decisiveness, Hier got on the telephone and set up a meeting in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving a week later, Hier discovered that his luggage had been lost. 
Unable to shave, he went down to the hotel barbershop. As Hier sat in the 
barber's chair, he noticed a framed, autographed photograph of Adolph Hitler. 
He doesn't remember what he said to the barber, but, for Hier, this was clearly 
an epiphanous moment. Although in the post-Holocaust world it was impolite to 
be openly anti-Semitic, there were clearly people out there who regretted that 
the Final Solution had not been final. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesenthal was flattered. The center would become America's answer to Yad 
Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust museum in Jerusalem. And Hier assured 
Wiesenthal, who detested the idea of a museum in which files and photographs 
would merely gather dust, that it would be run as an activist operation. "If 
they had said they wanted to set up on the East Coast," Wiesenthal says, "I'd 
have said no. It is built up already. But the West Coast was, from the Jewish 
point of view, a spiritual desert. And I felt that something should be done." 
</P>
<P>
Although Weisenthal's support of the center was what Hier wanted, it 
immediately embroiled the center in controversy. A few years before, a group of 
Holocaust survivors led by wealthy Jewish financier Abraham Spiegel, chairman 
of the board of Columbia Savings, had invited Wiesenthal to a dinner aimed at 
funding a Holocaust memorial in the federation's headquarters. What came out of 
that event is still debated. There are those within Spiegel's group who contend 
that they had cut a deal with Wiesenthal, that he had agreed to back their 
proposed memorial. Hier says that Wiesenthal had never agreed to lend his name 
to the Martyrs' Memorial Museum, and Wiesenthal concurs. Wiesenthal's 
withdrawal cost the group some $25,000 (but the memorial was eventually built). 
Although Hier reimbursed them, he was accused of underhanded dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, director of the Hillel Jewish Student Union at 
UCLA, recalls confronting Hier at the time. "I asked Hier why he was doing this 
when the Martyrs' Memorial had been in the works for 10 years and was reaching 
its culmination. His response was: 'We will do it bigger, better, faster -- and 
without the survivors.' There was no regard on his part for communal niceties 
or respect for the survivor community. It was a venture that he viewed as 
competitive. Whoever had the biggest center would be king." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, after the euphoria of the first dinner faded, the local Orthodox 
community became disenchanted as members recognized that Hier's commitment to 
the college was overshadowed by his commitment to the center. "He had a new 
toy," says one former center employee, "so Moish put aside the old toy." 
</P>
<P>
Their fears were well-grounded -- the school never evolved into a full-scale 
affiliate of Yeshiva University in New York. Today, YULA is, in essence, a high 
school. Indeed, when Hier recently made his appeal for a further $5 million in 
federal funding for his museum, some parents of YULA students threatened to 
withdraw their children, and there was serious talk of building a new Orthodox 
Jewish high school. Hier responded to this threat with customary aplomb; in 
late May, he outbid the city's Sikh and Sephardic Jewish communities for a 
school building on Robertson Boulevard, into which he plans to move at least 
the girls school. Heir says it cost the center $2.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Orthodox Jews have never been givers to The Wiesenthal Center. Hier, 
for his part, has not actively sought their support. "My appeal was always 
beyond the Orthodox community," he says. At times it has seemed that Hier has 
gone out of his way to offend his fellow Orthodox. Some academicians were 
reportedly disturbed when Hier, who possessed no academic credentials beyond 
his yeshiva ordination, had appointed himself "dean" of Yeshiva University of 
Los Angeles. And that, despite his lack of academic standing, he would not 
permit the parent organization in New York to exert any influence on his 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Not all Jewish leaders keep their sentiments private. For the past several 
years, Hyman Haves has been Hier's equal in tenacity and verve. The 74-year-old 
former ADL executive has publicly battled The Wiesenthal Center over its foray 
into California and federal politics. Haves believes the center -- which was 
united with the yeshiva and thus a religious institution -- has no business 
seeking money or favors from the government. Haves, in fact, testified before 
the Legislature against the approval of the $5-million grant in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Like Haves, UCLA's Rabbi Seidler-Feller has not always hidden his criticisms of 
Hier and The Wiesenthal Center. Seidler-Feller claims that his outspokeness 
almost cost him his job. At a Yom Kippur service several years ago, 
Seidler-Feller lectured that the center was an aberration from traditional 
Orthodoxy. "In Orthodox communities," says Siedler-Feller today, "you are never 
browbeaten with anti-Semitism. The Holocaust is not a force for promoting 
Jewishness. The agenda for Orthodoxy after the war was not to build memorials 
and not to cry, but to promote learning and create the positive capabilities 
for the survival of Judaism." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he says, an irate member of the center tried to have him fired. 
Hier says he, himself, would never have done such a thing, and knew nothing of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In its fervid pursuit of anti-Semitism, the center also sometimes slips. Last 
February, Donald Dean Hiner, a part-time history instructor at Indiana 
University-Purdue University at Indiana, taught that the Holocaust never took 
place and the Nazis had no plan to exterminate the Jews. Marcia Goldstone, 
director of the Jewish Community Relations Council in Indianapolis, worked 
behind the scenes on the Hiner case with university officials and the ADL. The 
university agreed to suspend Hiner with pay, indicating that he could be fired 
later. But a Midwest member of the center -- unaware of these moves -- called 
Cooper demanding action. Without telling the local Jewish establishment, 
Wiesenthal Center Director Gerald Margolis contacted the university and urged 
Hiner's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstone learned of his effort from the newspaper. She was not happy. "From 
the outside it looks like the Jewish community doesn't know what it's doing," 
she says. "From the inside it confuses and upsets people." 
</P>
<P>
Hier offered a grudging apology. But he hates the idea of having to observe 
Jewish organizational etiquette. "There is no such thing as somebody 'handling 
an incident,' " says Hier. "Who pre-assigned it? Was it a group that got 
together 90 years ago and said this is our turf? 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there is a danger of being too organized," says Hier. "Being too 
organized sometimes stifles creativity, individuality. Sometimes the organized 
Jewish community, by its democratic nature, becomes too unruly. It's hard to 
conduct a committee with 200 people." 
</P>
<P>
There have been occasions, however, in which Hier's disregard for diplomatic 
prerogatives could conceivably harm the very Jews he has sought to protect. For 
example, in 1985, Hier decided to commemorate the Armenian genocide in his 
museum, despite criticism from some elements of the Jewish community. The Turks 
soon responded to Hier's plan with veiled threats about no longer being able to 
"protect" the Jews living in Muslim Turkey. (Israel has been quiet regarding 
the Armenian genocide for precisely that reason.) 
</P>
<P>
Hier says he took the position in service to historical truth. The Armenian 
genocide happened, he says. That, in itself, is sufficient to be commemorated 
in his museum. 
</P>
<P>
"What Hier has done," said Berenbaum, Washington's Holocaust Memorial director, 
"which is an act of almost singular integrity, is not to allow the rewriting of 
history to the exclusion of Armenian genocide. He is saying if you can rewrite 
one history, you can rewrite another." 
</P>
<P>
As far as Israeli politics go, Hier believes it is not the place of American 
Jews to tell Israelis how to run their country. This does not preclude all 
criticism: He is aghast at the breakdown of Israel's electoral system and at 
its inept public relations. But he says he will always profess unqualified 
support for the government in power -- as long as certain lines are not 
crossed. For instance, Hier says he would never support or acquiesce to the 
expulsion of Palestinians from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Having gone 
through the Holocaust, he says, Jews must never subject another people to 
similar horrors. 
</P>
<P>
It all always seems to come back to the Holocaust, to Hier's burning dedication 
to never let anyone forget, and his use of its horrors to rally Jews 
everywhere. Rosalie Zalas, an advisor to Sen. Wilson and a member of the 
center's board of directors, believes Hier's attitude is not fanatical, but 
necessary. In 1964, Zalas and her young children followed her husband, a doctor 
assigned to the United States Army, to West Germany. She knew German, and was 
shocked by what people said to each other about the Holocaust when they thought 
she couldn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
"It was appalling to find out there was such a large number of Germans, 
particularly older Germans, who never really regretted the Holocaust," she 
says. "They only regretted that they had not finished the job and there were 
still people left to talk about it." When she asked the location of the Dachau 
concentration camp, people feigned ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
When Zalas moved to Los Angeles a few years later, she was distressed to find 
that the city's Jewish community also largely ignored the Holocaust. "Before 
The Wiesenthal Center, nobody knew anything about the Holocaust, nobody talked 
about it." The sole exception, she said, was Marvin Hier. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some people wish he would keep quiet about it once in a while. 
Seidler-Feller keeps a "Holocaust abuse file" in his office that is filled with 
news of The Wiesenthal Center's activities. Raising the specter of the 
Holocaust at every turn lessens its horror and denies its singularity, 
Seidler-Feller says. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally respected leader Rabbi Harold Schulweis, of Valley Beth Shalom in 
Encino, has his own misgivings: "Ideologically, I am concerned with the 
imbalance in the center's regard for the Holocaust," he says. "It is the 
predominant event in the Jewish psyche. Jews have the Holocaust clinging 
beneath their skin, in their nostrils. The majority of the people out there 
find their strong and their visceral identification through the Holocaust, and 
Hier has been able to tap into that." That ability is harmful to Jews, he says. 
"I think there is that one-sided, mono-dimensional aspect to the center's take 
on the Holocaust that I honestly believe is inimical to Jewish flexibility, 
creativity and innovativeness. It is a sad shortcut to Jewish loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
Hier finds these criticisms irrelevant. In his view, memory and warning are 
inseparable. The Holocaust must be recalled so as to never be repeated. His 
message is that Jews are never safe, that anti-Semitism is pandemic, occurring 
everywhere and in various degrees of virulence, and no matter the occasion, 
Jews must always stand up for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I have experienced anti-Semitism in public life in a very profound way," says 
Hier, harking back to his dinner with the Queen. Sitting at his table -- Hier 
had ordered a kosher meal -- was a kilt-clad Canadian admiral holding forth on 
the ethnicity he declared was ruining Canada. The admiral turned to Hier and 
said: "Take you, rabbi. Here we all are having dinner. And you have to eat 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
Hier turned to the admiral in disgust: "With all due respect, sir," Hier said, 
"if you are not embarrassed to sit amongst us wearing a skirt, I don't think I 
have to be embarrassed about what I choose to eat."
