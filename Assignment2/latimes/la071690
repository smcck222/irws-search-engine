MEDIA BIAS ON ABORTION ISSUE

<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the series. Since pro-life sentiment is as intense and widespread 
in this country as pro-choice sentiment is, how does it happen that journalists 
in big-city news organizations "don't seem to have many friends or colleagues 
who oppose abortion," so that they aren't even aware of the magnitude of 
pro-life rallies like the one in April? 
</P>
<P>
What kind of hiring and promotion practices are producing whole staffs with the 
same blind spot? What other issues are being screened out in the same way, 
while the media spotlights converge momentarily on broccoli?

The articles were outstanding. I can only hope that this is a new beginning for 
The Times and other media. I can only hope that this isn't just a bone thrown 
to the dog so that he will stop barking and go away. 
</P>
<P>
All any "pro-life advocate" has ever asked is that there is fair reporting. 
That's all that is asked now. 
</P>
<P>
The "liberal media" and the "conservative anti-abortion activists" need to 
consider two things when they are speaking out. Women who find themselves in a 
crisis pregnancy situation need compassion, understanding and very practical 
help. And unborn babies who are in danger of being aborted also need advocates 
to speak out in their defense. Unborn children are valuable and they have the 
right to our compassion and protection.

KAIFU IS QUITE RIGHT TO WORRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan has an image problem. Even Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu admits to it. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta last week, Kaifu announced an initiative aimed at shoring up Japan's 
sagging image among grass-roots Americans. Although his "Communication 
Improvement Initiative" lacked specifics, Kaifu said programs, such as Japanese 
language classes for Americans, would be developed to advance "true mutual 
understanding." Japan has succeeded in selling Toyotas, Walkmans and 
videocassette recorders to Americans, but will they buy a new image? 
</P>
<P>
Polls reveal that while most Americans are friendly toward Japan, they are 
increasingly worried about Japanese investment here and are less hospitable 
toward it. Sadly, among some U.S. minorities, Japan is perceived as racist. 
</P>
<P>
Such attitudes have unleashed new xenophobia toward Japan. The widespread 
popularity of such sentiments is reflected in books, movies and even in 
advertisements that pit American interests against Japanese. And some of this 
animosity against the Japanese smacks of racism, too. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, Japan's economic success drives home our own failure to balance 
the books. The huge federal deficit is aggravated by a $49-billion trade 
deficit with Japan that many Americans attribute in part to Japan's 
unwillingness to open its markets. For its part, Japan has worked hard to 
defuse the volatility in U.S.-Japan relations. It is the No. 1 foreign buyer of 
U.S. securities and agriculture. The nation recently agreed to a massive 
increase in public spending and market-opening measures in trade talks with the 
United States. Since last fall, "corporate good citizenship" has been the buzz 
phrase among Japanese executives in the States who are contributing millions to 
American charities. 
</P>
<P>
But it will take more than donations and language lessons to polish Japan's 
image. Japan, for example, needs to open its rice market and make it easier for 
U.S. retailers to open stores in Japan. The truth is that Japan's problem isn't 
only one of image but of reality as well. Kaifu was wise to address it. It 
won't go away easily.

Can I believe my eyes? Just yesterday you finished an excellent, in-depth 
series by Shaw on the extent of blatant pro-abortion bias in the media. Today, 
as I open my paper (July 5, Page B2), I see that the listing of Los Angeles 
area hot lines includes (of course) an abortion referral service but does not 
include any of the pro-life agencies which exist to render medical, financial 
and emotional support to those courageous young women who refuse to abort their 
developing children. It kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

Rosemead was sprayed with malathion 10, count them, 10 times between November, 
1989, and May of this year in order to eradicate Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
But (need we really say it?) they're back: Two more Medflies were found there 
in the last two weeks, and more spraying is scheduled to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
There are all sorts of excuses. Some officials believe infested fruit could 
have been brought back into the area. Others say that the eradication program 
was simply inexpertly executed. 
</P>
<P>
OK. It's nice to give people the benefit of the doubt, but obviously 
eradication is not occurring. So maybe state Medfly officials have an odd 
definition of "eradication"? 
</P>
<P>
Isn't the seemingly permanent presence of the pesky fly evidence to support 
entomologist James Carey's assertion that the Medfly has only been suppressed, 
never eradicated, over the last 15 years? 
</P>
<P>
If suppression is all we really gain from pesticide spraying, shouldn't the 
state say that? 
</P>
<P>
The danger is that maybe the enemy isn't so much the Medfly as ourselves: State 
policy is premised on an endgame of wipeout, unconditional surrender, 
eradication. But is this real? Must we really spray Rosemead 10 times in order 
to save it? 
</P>
<P>
The state should review the facts of the Medfly -- especially its consistent 
reappearance -- and reassess just what kind of war this is. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to win a war if you don't know precisely what kind of struggle you 
are in.

CANDOR IN ALL THINGS NUCLEAR; 
</P>
<P>
HANFORD COVERUP RAISES ANEW THE CREDIBILITY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nuclear age dawned with virtually no indication of how deadly some of the 
byproducts of making bombs can be. Time taught the nuclear industry better, and 
even though building safeguards was a sloppier process than it should have 
been, managers and workers learned to respect the lethal power of nuclear 
byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
So did the federal government in its role as regulator. Unfortunately, 
government still underestimates the danger of either lying to people about 
nuclear accidents and health threats or, just as bad, of hiding what it knows. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of candor in all things nuclear was emphasized this week with 
the release of data assembled during an unfinished study of leaks of 
radioactive iodine from a plant at Hanford in western Washington state that 
manufactured plutonium for nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
The data, which was pried loose from secret government files by an 
environmental lawsuit, shows that 13,500 residents in the vicinity of the plant 
were exposed to levels of radioactivity high enough to damage their thyroid 
glands and perhaps cause cancer. The air was contaminated between 1944 and 
1947, and although the government had known this for years, it denied any 
threat to health virtually right up to the moment the results of the study were 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, who has had the good sense to throw open the 
books on the nuclear past since he took over the department, says Hanford's 
only mission now is to clean up the mess it made during the nuclear arms race. 
In fact, residents around Hanford have not been at risk from leakage of 
radioactive iodine for some years. But except for the example Watkins has set 
in recent months, it can hardly be said that residents are at no risk of being 
misled by their government. Washington can ride out almost unlimited numbers of 
dumb decisions as long as its credibility is good. Without credibility, even 
wise decisions can be made to look bad.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE SOVIET UNION; 
</P>
<P>
LET REFORMS TAKE HOLD BEFORE AID FLOWS; 
</P>
<P>
A STUDY OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY WILL HELP, BUT CAUTIOUS GUIDELINES FOR WESTERN 
AID CAN ALREADY BE DRAWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK KRAMER, Mark Kramer is a research fellow at Brown University's Center 
for Foreign Policy Development and a fellow of Harvard University's Russian 
Research Center.

<TEXT>
<P>
Western governments are justified in considering whether they can encourage 
far-reaching economic liberalization in the Soviet Union. The dominant impetus 
for reform will have to come from within the Soviet Union itself but, at least 
at the margins, the West may have a useful role to play. 
</P>
<P>
What that role should be is a point of contention, however. Last week's 
economic summit in Houston revealed fundamental disagreements among the 
industrial democracies about how to aid the Soviet Union. West Germany is eager 
to move ahead promptly with large-scale monetary assistance, in no small part 
to obtain Soviet acceptance of a reunited Germany within the Atlantic Alliance. 
Bonn has already proposed $15 billion in aid, with more than $3 billion to come 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The other two leading economic powers -- the United States and Japan -- have 
been far more cautious. The Bush Administration is reluctant to provide any 
financial assistance until the Soviets adopt genuine market reforms and cut 
their military budget. President Bush has suggested that instead of sending 
money, Western countries should simply provide technical specialists to offer 
advice on how to set up a private banking system, a stock market and other 
institutions. The Japanese also are wary of supplying aid before reforms are 
implemented, an are reluctant to establish closer economic ties at all unless 
the Soviet Union agrees to give back the four northern Japanese islands that it 
annexed in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Having failed to reach a consensus on the matter, the assembled leaders agreed 
merely to sponsor a study of Soviet economic needs, while allowing individual 
Western countries, especially West Germany and France, to offer financial aid 
to Moscow on a bilateral basis. The proposed study is to be carried out by the 
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, in conjunction with the European Community, and is 
to be released at the end of the year. A separate group under the European 
Community's auspices has already embarked on a study of the Soviet economy, 
which is scheduled to be completed by October. While both studies may provide 
some useful details, it is already possible to set forth some tentative 
guidelines for a collective Western economic strategy vis-a-vis the Soviet 
Union: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The cautious approach espoused by the American and Japanese governments 
makes sense. The experience with Poland in the 1970s, when large infusions of 
Western aid induced the Polish government to avoid much-needed reforms, is 
worth bearing in mind. The unreformed Polish economy could not properly absorb 
imports of Western technology and the country was soon mired in economic 
decline as well as burdened with a huge foreign debt. That pattern could repeat 
itself in the Soviet Union if Western aid is not carefully timed and targeted. 
Already, imported Western machinery often sits rusting in crates after arriving 
in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Despite the need for caution, the Bush Administration is wise to let the 
West German and French governments press ahead with large-scale financial 
credits. Both governments have strong political motivations to provide the aid 
and any heavy-handed American attempt to discourage them from doing so would be 
futile and counterproductive. What the United States might do, however, is to 
consult closely with the West Germans and the French to ensure that the 
assistance is targeted either to the fledgling private sector or to the 
decrepit Soviet transportation network. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For some time to come, the bulk of Western aid to countries outside the 
developing world should still be directed to East European states such as 
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Progress toward democratic systems and 
free-market economies is far greater in these countries than it is in the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Political issues such as Japan's desire to regain the northern islands and 
the American demand for a reduction in Soviet military aid to Cuba are 
legitimate considerations. But these issues are best dealt with primarily 
behind the scenes, where a change of Soviet policy will not be as easily 
construed as a humiliating backdown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the near term, the Bush Administration's proposal to send technical 
advisers is a sound one, particularly if it includes specialists who can devise 
a pool of basic data about the Soviet economy. The lack of reliable statistics 
has been a great impediment to economic reform. In addition, it would be useful 
to provide Western technicians who can assist Soviet military factories in 
their conversion to civilian production. 
</P>
<P>
If genuine market-oriented reforms do take hold, then collective Western 
assistance might then be appropriate. Such assistance, however, should be 
directed almost exclusively to the private sector, including cooperatives and 
joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the European Community are the appropriate channels for collective 
Western aid. Although the record of the IMF is mixed, it is the only 
international agency well-suited to deal with countries that are moving toward 
free-market systems. Moreover, the IMF has considerable experience in Eastern 
Europe. It will take time, of course, before Moscow is willing to divulge the 
kinds of information that the IMF would demand. But if Soviet leaders are 
sincere about wanting to adopt market-oriented reforms, they will almost surely 
agree to disclose more data than they ever would have in the past. Channeling 
some aid through the European Community would be a useful complement to the 
IMF, to avoid the appearance of relying too heavily on any single organization. 
</P>
<P>
A coordinated Western strategy will not greatly ease the process of Soviet 
economic reform. The outcome of that process will ultimately depend on what the 
Soviet Union itself can accomplish. But at least Western governments will be 
able to do what they can to promote greater democracy and a free-market Soviet 
economy, not to mention a continued easing of East-West relations.

The Wrath of Chung: Connie Chung got a little miffed Saturday when the tables 
were turned and she was barraged with questions about the glitz factor of her 
newly redone interview show on CBS. "You people are so insulting," she told a 
roomful of television critics at the Century Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The reporters were grilling her about the news value of "Face to Face With 
Connie Chung," formerly "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," which moves with 
its new name to Mondays at 10 p.m. next Monday. Chung insisted that celebrity 
interviews were not the driving force of her hourlong program, despite recent 
network promotions that highlight the star-side chats. "Look, it's a magazine 
program," Chung said, her voice rising. "We're going to have all kinds of 
stories." GREG BRAXTON

Friday at a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz. She was 81 and had retired to Arizona 
many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Said to have been F. Scott Fitzgerald's inspiration for Rosemary in "Tender Is 
the Night," Mrs. Young, who acted as Lois Moran, was last before the cameras in 
1954 when she played May Herrick, wife of Capt. John Herrick (Preston Foster) 
in the TV series "Waterfront," based on the adventures of a tugboat captain in 
San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Young, born in Pittsburgh, was given dancing lessons at an early age, 
studied in France and danced with the Paris Opera. She was photographed by Man 
Ray and made two films in Europe when Samuel Goldwyn discovered her. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, he wanted her for the lead in "Romeo and Juliet," but she became 
Laurel in his 1925 "Stella Dallas" with Ronald Colman. She appeared in more 
than two dozen movies, among them "Reckless Lady," "The Road to Mandalay," 
"Mammy" and "The Men in Her Life." 
</P>
<P>
She then studied singing and made her Broadway debut in "This Is New York" 
before starring in George S. Kaufman-Morrie Ryskind long-running satiric hit 
"Of Thee I Sing." 
</P>
<P>
While in Hollywood, she had become friendly with Fitzgerald and his wife, 
Zelda, and was said to have been his model for Rosemary Hoyt, the film starlet 
in Fitzgerald's semi-autobiographical novel of disillusioned Americans living 
in the decadence of post-World War I Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In 1935 she married Clarence M. Young, a vice president of Pan American World 
Airways who was a year younger than her mother. She told Richard Lamparski in a 
1985 interview for his "Whatever Became of . . . ?" series of books on former 
stars that they were "wonderfully happy" until his death in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s she taught drama and dance at Stanford University and then 
co-starred in "Waterfront," retiring after that. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by a son, Timothy.

MYSELF AND MARCO POLO BY PAUL GRIFFITHS RANDOM HOUSE $17.95, 274 PAGES ;

ANSWERING RHETORICAL QUESTIONS

<P>
Since "Myself and Marco Polo" is a book made up of rhetorical, philosophical 
questions, let me begin by asking a few myself: Is it at once possible to be a 
part of the avant-garde and yet remain squarely in the mainstream? Is it 
possible -- at the same time -- to be both clever as the firefly and dull as 
mud? Is it possible to be, in outlook, at once a Young Turk as well as an Old 
Fud? 
</P>
<P>
Yes. Yes it is. "Myself and Marco Polo" manages all this as well as registering 
within the reader the responses of both extreme age and extreme youth. By Page 
10 of this thing, I felt at least 105 years old: Haven't I been exposed to 
these so-called philosophical questions since time began? By Page 266, as a 
character earnestly remarks: "A statue is a representation of a person, even as 
this body walking beside me is a representation of you. If I touch your arm . . 
. do I touch you, or do I merely touch your arm. Surely I can never touch the 
you that is a breath within your mind. . . . Is it in your mind that the sun 
warms? . . . Then in those respects your mind is congruent with those of the 
lizard and the tree. You are perhaps not so young as you imagine." Well, the 
authors write about that one. Because didn't most of us cover that material 
back in lower division philosophy? Wasn't that a long time ago, even if it was 
only last semester? That's why I feel 105 years old when I read this book -- 
stuck, paralyzed, drowned in the eternal moment of reading a novel where plot, 
character, time and place and prose style and everything else that should go 
into a novel have all become subservient to the primary purpose of proving the 
cleverness of the author. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, reading "Myself and Marco Polo" on a summer afternoon makes 
me feel five years old. When another character opines: "Truth is not to be our 
itinerary. But perhaps there is in that a kind of realism. If we strive for 
truth, we are bound to lie. Whereas if we set out instead to produce a 
fabrication . . . If one has regrets, I suppose they are a sort of egoism." 
When a character opines that sort of thing, you begin to think of the lawn out 
at the back of the house. And you could turn on the sprinkler out on that lawn. 
And if you were 5 years old you could run through that sprinkler, and you 
wouldn't have to be reading this book. 
</P>
<P>
But no, as the Chinese proverb says, "There is no help for it." You're in this 
book, and you've got to read right on through. The year is 1298, but as the 
author suggests, "You speak as if the past had the reality of another country, 
as if there is notionally a place called 1298 to be visited and inspected." The 
real Marco Polo is in prison with a fellow named Rustichello, who proposes to 
ghostwrite his fellow prisoner's memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
This brings up every possible question about geography, commercial success, 
truth, lies, the nature of knowledge, as well as fast-forward vignettes in the 
form of contemporary restaurant reviews, and fancy Venetian businesswomen who 
work with Olivetti word processors, and offhand references to the Golden Gate 
Bridge. Marco Polo recounts some of his adventures in Peking, including a visit 
to a place where Guardians of information read that information, and then 
destroy it so that the human race will know less than we started out with. 
Travel literature is satirized. The kitchen sink is thrown in there somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But listen. There is an audience for this book. Rebellious, alienated high 
school kids; the kind you see on television commercials -- kids who do 
unwholesome things like talk back to their parents and stay in their room alone 
a lot. Wrap this book in matte black paper and tell them you finally see things 
their way. You'll have them back outside, running through the sprinkler, in no 
time.

SANITIZED 'SHOW BOAT' STILL STEAMS ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few shows in the annals of the American musical have engendered as much 
excitement, as many unforgettable songs or as much scholarly debate as "Show 
Boat." Since the original score and orchestrations were lost for more than 50 
years, what is or is not an authentic piece of Jerome Kern's and Oscar 
Hammerstein's original 1927 Broadway musical has fueled contentious scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
What "Show Boat" is, is a brilliant hybrid, born on the cusp of the fading 
European operetta and heralding the emergence of the full-fledged American 
musical. 
</P>
<P>
It dealt with unprecedented themes (discrimination and miscegenation) and 
required one of the earliest interracial casts. And it has triumphed over 
changes of the last six decades, buoyed by its elegance and the magnificence of 
its songs. What a collection: "Make-Believe," "Ol' Man River," "Can't Help 
Lovin' Dat Man," "Bill," "Why Do I Love You?" 
</P>
<P>
The joys of this musical will endure well beyond the 1926 Edna Ferber novel on 
which it is based -- and so, no doubt, will the disputes. How much you like 
Opera Pacific's version of "Show Boat" at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center will depend on how knowledgeable you are about the history of the 
63-year-old show and how much authenticity matters. 
</P>
<P>
This "Show Boat" is a well-sung, vigorous and attractive production, calculated 
to be untaxing (which should not equate with unmoving) entertainment. It has an 
undiminished supervaudevillian in Eddie Bracken as the show's comic 
centerpiece, Cap'n Andy; a vocally powerful yet physically dainty Magnolia in 
Patti Cohenour; a glamorous, seductively understated Gay Ravenal in Ron Raines; 
a properly flinty Parthy Ann in tall Claudia Wilkens; an ample, open-throated 
Queenie in short Consuelo Hill; and a loose-as-a-goose, lively Frank Schultz, 
the buck and wing man, in Keith Savage. 
</P>
<P>
Other choices are more equivocal. Lubitza Gregus' hounded Julie has the restive 
darkness of a tormented woman, but not always the vulnerability that should go 
with it. Jeanette Palmer plays Ellie May as a dumb and giddy blonde, but 
forgets the serious subtext that makes her yearn to become a tragedian, even if 
she can't hack it. The casting of Michel Warren Bell as Joe, however, is the 
thorniest. Bell can deliver a song and a half ("Ol' Man River"), but he is too 
urbane and young to make us believe he's been towing barges or lifting cotton, 
let alone "tired of livin' and skeered of dyin'." 
</P>
<P>
This is where opera company stagings of musical theater hit their major snag: 
in the casting of accomplished singers who are less adept as actors. (The L.A. 
Opera "Oklahoma!" is a recent case in point.) Few here need body mikes, but all 
get them, often to wretchedly cavernous effect. 
</P>
<P>
This "Show Boat" revival is based on director Michael Kahn's 1982 Houston Grand 
Opera production and, under current director Mike Phillips, claims to be 
offering the "original full score." Original, yes; full, no. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestrations are lush and lilting, but several numbers and/or half 
numbers have been dropped, as well as some characters (Rubber Face, Old Sport, 
the faro dealer, who can't be there since his scene is gone too). 
</P>
<P>
Vanished is Gay Ravenal's "Till Good Luck Comes My Way," which firmly 
establishes him as a gamblin' man, and parts of the opening sequence of Act II, 
which takes place at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. (That date is correct in 
the program, but shown as 1892 on Helen Pond's and Herbert Senn's set, 
originally designed for Houston Grand Opera. You'd think there would have been 
time to fix it.) 
</P>
<P>
Gone too is the second-act scene in the lobby of Chicago's Sherman House, where 
Parthy and Cap'n Andy have come in search of Magnolia and Gay -- and where 
Cap'n Andy meets his three coquettes (two at Opera Pacific). Instead, we're 
back on the top deck of the Cotton Blossom in a scene originally written for 
the 1936 "Show Boat" film. It gets us to the same place in the end, but not via 
the 1927 route. 
</P>
<P>
More important than achieving the exact letter of the original, is not falsely 
claiming to do so -- and working harder at achieving its spirit. This is 1990, 
after all, and some streamlining can make sense. What does not make sense is 
Opera Pacific's bowdlerizing -- as have countless other productions -- of the 
word "nigger" from the lyrics of "Ol' Man River" on the grounds that it is 
"insensitive" and has lost its "shock value." The treatment of blacks in 1927 
was not nice. Eschewing the word is truly offensive, since it sanitizes a 
version already too squeaky clean by the glossing over of the harsher aspects 
of black life -- aspects that the 1927 show had the honesty and guts to 
explore. 
</P>

<P>
In the Bay Area, artist Jay DeFeo -- who died last year -- used to be famous 
for a work few people had ever seen. "The Rose," which she worked on for seven 
years in the '50s, is a delicately surfaced, 12-foot-high, 2,300-pound behemoth 
that started out as a monochrome painting and wound up as a hybrid sculpture. 
After covering the surface with layer after layer of brushwork -- bulking up as 
much as eight inches -- DeFeo began embedding beads and other doodads in the 
piece, and carving the encrustations of paint. 
</P>
<P>
Well, "The Rose" isn't included in "Jay DeFeo: Works on Paper" -- an exhibit of 
38 years of her work at Laguna Art Museum through Oct. 7 -- because it 
emphatically is not a work on paper, and in any case has been in storage since 
1972 after an uncompleted attempt at restoration. But the impetus behind this 
epic piece is strongly related to DeFeo's smaller-scale work, and in fact, a 
few of the drawings are on a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
Often using everyday objects as a starting point, DeFeo focused on 
relationships of forms to create work with an abstract feel and an insistent 
undercurrent of perceptual and psychological disquiet. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these not-quite-paintings, not-quite-drawings look like images of 
real-life objects in the process of disappearing, or changing into another 
form. Sometimes it's difficult to figure out just what the original object was 
-- either because it has become so blurred and fragmentary, or because the 
angle DeFeo chose was so unusual. (Drawings of a camera tripod, a tape 
dispenser and a shoe tree are examples of this kind of mysterious evasion.) 
</P>
<P>
DeFeo often reworked a single piece for months -- a methodical approach more 
often associated with painting than drawing -- and frequently applied several 
media (primarily acrylic, pastel, charcoal and wax pencil) in sequences of 
layers to achieve the occluded effects she had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The Eyes," a large and uncharacteristically clear-cut image, is nonetheless 
intrinsically related to her more obscure pieces. It is about the process of 
seeing, the essential subject of DeFeo's transmutations of form. The pale glow 
emanating from the giant eyes (based on DeFeo's own) suggests the focused 
concentration of a larger-than-life Seer -- or an artist who quietly claims 
such powers. 
</P>
<P>
Clusters of fine, vertical lines read as reflections from a curtain positioned 
between the Seer and the viewer and rendered transparent by the intensity of 
the Seer's gaze. Other lines form a three-dimensional scaffolding, a fantasy 
architecture. And still other uncountable networks of fine lines represent 
individual strands of hair, eyebrow growth and separate lashes. The accretion 
of patient detail suggests a near-obsessive fascination with getting down on 
paper a magnified and hyperintense image of reality. 
</P>
<P>
Jay was a high school nickname for Mary Joan that proved a usefully gender-free 
tag in the overwhelmingly male world of art. (Even at UC Berkeley, where she 
was an undergraduate, there was only one female instructor in the art 
department.) 
</P>
<P>
She came on the scene as a painter during the golden years of the '50s and '60s 
when the young Funk artists, Beat poets and jazz musicians were cooking up 
cockeyed rhapsodies and living on a dime. For a time, she was married to Wally 
Hendrick, a leading Funk artist. But at a time of social protest and exuberant 
in-group activities, she was an independent visionary devoting herself to what 
she called "private" art. 
</P>
<P>
The size of her work at any given moment had a lot to do with where she was 
living. Working in a large studio after her return from Europe, she made 
plaster sculptures; when the rent became prohibitive, she moved to a small 
apartment and began turning out jewelry and works on paper. All this work was 
small-scale. The jewelry, which she sold to a chichi dealer, was a means of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Acclaim came at 30, in 1959, when DeFeo was chosen as one of the "Sixteen 
Americans" -- also including such soon-to-be-famous artists as Jasper Johns and 
Robert Rauschenberg -- showcased at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Yet 
the traditional markers of success eluded her for many years. 
</P>
<P>
In common with many female artists, privacy became the watchword of her life as 
well as of her art. She didn't push to get her work shown, and her dealer at 
the time apparently wasn't able to sell much. Happily, in the last decade of 
her life -- cut short by cancer -- a number of exhibitions reintroduced her to 
the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by Sidra Stich, chief curator at the University Art Museum, UC 
Berkeley, this exhibit is a revelation. A superbly sensitive draftsman, DeFeo 
also was a strikingly analytical thinker. Like one of those people who love to 
take things apart just so they can put them together again, she seems to have 
been constantly teasing out the relationships of curved surfaces to knife-thin 
edges, solidity to transparency, objects to the marks they make ("Eraser"). 
</P>
<P>
But there is a lot of passion, quirkiness and sensuality in this work, too. In 
"Untitled (For B.C.)" -- for the artist Bruce Connor -- DeFeo mates a golf bag 
and an upside-down pointed light bulb, surely a sexual metaphor. Flung-down 
blobs of thick white oil paint and long tracks of graphite applied with a heavy 
hand give "Death Wish" a fierceness for which its title alone can't be 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
And what about "September Blackberries" -- a little photograph of loose teeth 
gathered in a clam shell? Or "Blossom," a collage in which photographs of what 
look like fraternity boys on the beach form the center of the flower, and 
luxurious female nudes form the petals? Or the immense "Doctor Jazz" with its 
guitar pegs, vague heart-shape, half-hidden eyes and strands of hair? 
</P>
<P>
In her detailed catalogue essay, Brigid Doherty, a graduate student in the UC 
Berkeley history of art department, analyzes DeFeo's art from the point of view 
of Conceptual Art. While many previous commentators have focused on DeFeo's 
deft handling of media, Doherty adds an intellectual dimension by demonstrating 
out the artist's self-conscious awareness of the way she perceived the world. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Doherty pays little attention to the ways DeFeo was a part 
of the Beat/Funk art climate. For example, it is incredible that the writer 
could discuss the drawing called "Apparition" -- a curiously disturbing image 
of curling wisps of hair -- without referring to its intensely sexual aura. 
DeFeo's art was anything but rigidly theoretical. It was inclusive, rather than 
exclusive, and it remained "personal" and analytical while embracing the 
anarchic spirit in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay DeFeo: Works on Paper" continues through Oct. 7 at the Laguna Art Museum, 
307 Cliff Drive, Laguna Beach. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays 
through Sundays (until 8 p.m. Fridays during July and August). Admission: $2

CLASSIC SANTANA: UNRETIRED AND RELIABLY INSPIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Santana released its career-retrospective triple-album "Viva Santana!" in 
1988, with a corresponding tour, Carlos Santana promised that the 
Latin-jazz-rock fusion band would thereafter "call it a day, at least for a 
while." Explained the guitarist at the time, "I don't want to just crank out 
'Black Magic Woman' and 'Jingo' in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Spoken like a true pop veteran, a la Sinatra or Bowie or Elton, and broken just 
like one too. A year and a half later, guess who's back on tour. And what's 
still being cranked out. 
</P>
<P>
No one was heard objecting to this backtracking, of course, among the full 
house Friday night at the Greek Theatre (the first of three nights there for 
Santana), and there was not much reason to: The outfit's nearly three-hour set 
is always reliably inspired from year to year -- with even the oldest material 
sounding more fired up than cranked out -- and the live blend of styles, 
whatever might be happening on the band's albums, is usually scarcely subject 
to the shifting vagaries of new musical tastes. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, the current album, "Spirits Dancing in the Flesh," while 
typically overproduced, adheres more closely to a classic Santana sound than 
some of the band's compromised '80s LPs, and the set included the bulk of the 
album, with vocal numbers sung smoothly and solidly by Alex Ligertwood. 
</P>
<P>
The funky remake of the Isleys' "That Lady" (given a modern, black-dance beat 
and retitled "Who's That Lady") and the ballad treatment of Curtis Mayfield's 
"Gypsy Woman" by no means count among the group's more memorable moments but 
provided diverting enough pop turns amid the instrumental stretches that 
account for at least 75% of a Santana show. 
</P>
<P>
New material aside, all that's markedly different about Santana these days is 
that the hair is bundled into ponytails, keyboard player Chester Thompson does 
a little bit of sampling and the wacky weed smell among the crowd isn't quite 
so choking. In many more ways a Santana concert still seems the quintessential 
'70s experience, preserved as carefully as a museum piece, complete with 
unabashed emphasis on mind expansion through soloing. 
</P>
<P>
Really, though, it's the quintessential '90s concert happening, at least for 
L.A., given our shifting demographics: Carlos Santana remains the foremost 
enduring music hero for rock-era Latinos, as well as a guitar hero for the 
masses, and the group's local shows are as genuinely integrated an experience 
as it's possible to have right now. CHRIS WILLMAN

REBA'S FINE VOICE AGAINST DULL SONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reba McEntire confirmed an old adage at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim: It's 
not the singer, it's the song. 
</P>
<P>
McEntire is a gifted, intense vocalist with soaring power and a firmly 
controlled country quaver. Despite those advantages, the singer from Oklahoma 
wallowed in dullness for most of Friday's 70-minute early show. That will 
happen when a concert is devoted mainly to hit fodder culled from Nashville 
music mills. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff between a fine voice and uninvolving songs finally ended, but only 
when McEntire reached back 20 years or more for some worthy material. 
</P>
<P>
Singing a close-to-the-original take on Aretha Franklin's "Respect" might not 
have been the height of imagination, but it was a singular achievement for a 
country singer to pull it off without being overshadowed by the source. 
</P>
<P>
McEntire also brought an edge and a some convincing role-playing to her remake 
of "Fancy," Bobbie Gentry's 1969 tale of a poor country girl who climbs the 
ladder of success by selling her body to rich gents. As usual, McEntire encored 
with a tour-de-force,a cappella treatment of Patsy Cline's "Sweet Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
McEntire spent far more time singing middle-of-the-road, pop-country hybrids. 
It was as if she were trying to be like another brassy redhead, Bette Midler, 
only with an Oklahoma twang. That wasn't the wind beneath McEntire's spurs -- 
it was the ersatz waft of synthesized strings and the schmaltzy, hollow 
tinkling of digital keyboards, used as a cushion against intrusions of realism. 
</P>
<P>
The only hints of traditional country style came in a Western swing dance 
number inserted so McEntire could change outfits, and in a long medley of 
heartbroken ballads. It was no great loss that the songs in the medley were 
truncated, because few of them rose beyond a rote familiarity of sentiment and 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
McEntire could use some spare, tradition-minded country arrangements. It also 
wouldn't hurt for her to get in touch with some songwriters whose material is 
personal and individual. After six years as one of country music's two or three 
most popular female singers, she needs to get it into her head that a 
distinctive talent shouldn't be wasted on songs that sound as if they were 
bought off the rack. MIKE BOEHM

EXEMPLARY BLUES-ROCK FROM MICK TAYLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember Mick Taylor? 
</P>
<P>
In case you've forgotten, Taylor is the superb blues guitarist who played with 
John Mayall's Bluesbreakers in the late '60s and rose to fame when he replaced 
Brian Jones in the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving the Stones in the mid '70s, Taylor has surfaced occasionally, 
with different bands or playing guest spots on albums or on movie scores. He's 
never gotten the acclaim he deserves, but whenever he plays the real blues-rock 
fans turn up. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of two shows at the Palomino on Friday, Taylor showed that he's 
one of the greats of the genre. He played an exemplary set -- mostly raunchy, 
Chicago-style blues with solid rock underpinnings. He and his four backing 
musicians' lengthy instrumental jams, sprinkled with vocals, were tautly 
constructed and never meandered. 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of set that, while common in the rock scene in the late '60s 
and most of the '70s, is rarely heard anymore -- highlighted by driving beats; 
tight, faultless accompaniment; cleverly interwoven ideas; and dexterous lead 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
But this wasn't dinosaur music. Taylor and his band played the creaky old 
standard "Red House," infusing it with a freshness and enough illuminating 
moments to make it sound almost brand new. DENNIS HUNT

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NOW THE PUBLIC CAN BE PRIVY TO A BIT OF LAWRENCE WELK LORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Uh-one and a uh-two. Or: It's wunnerful to be from North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
There's no dispute that Lawrence Welk, now 87 and semi-retired, has had his 
share of honors. 
</P>
<P>
Take a squint at the lobby of the Lawrence Welk Theatre north of Escondido, 
which is part of the Lawrence Welk Resort on Lawrence Welk Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The theater lobby is the family authorized Lawrence Welk Museum: gold records, 
plaques of appreciation, presidential proclamations and more. Outside is a 
bronze statue of the Champagne Music Maker. 
</P>
<P>
But now even the official Welk cult has been one-upped. 
</P>
<P>
A save-our-heritage group in North Dakota has announced plans to spend $250,000 
to renovate the Welk farm in Strasburg (population 600), where Welk lived until 
age 21. 
</P>
<P>
The governor came down from Bismarck to bless the project and listen to some 
German polkas. Welk stayed in Santa Monica but sent a warm telegram. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation will include the Welk family's sod house, granary, buggy barn 
and outhouse. Repeat: outhouse. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that anyone whose youthful privy is considered a cultural landmark 
has soared indeed to an impressive height. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Eiseman, executive director of Welk Heritage Inc., explained from 
Strasburg that the outhouse is important. Without it, the verisimilitude of a 
real farm would be kaput. 
</P>
<P>
It'll be a working one-seater, with a mail-order catalogue hung on a hook. Such 
catalogues were a link to the outside world for the Welk family and other 
German-Russian settlers, Eiseman noted. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been recorded whether Welk was reading a catalogue when he was 
inspired (in 1927) to form the Honolulu Fruit Gum Orchestra and head for 
WNAX-radio in Yankton, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
I'll leave that to the biographers. 
</P>

Masked Man Rides Again 
</P>
<P>
Public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
* Who was that politically active masked man? 
</P>
<P>
John Hart, 75, a retired actor who played the Lone Ranger on television for two 
seasons in the 1950s, is living in a mobile-home park in Warner Springs. 
</P>
<P>
He's joined his neighbors in opposing the county plan for a garbage dump in 
nearby Blue Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
To help fund the fight, Hart is selling autographs at $2 each. 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. District Judge John Rhoades holds the key to San Diego's political 
future as he decides whether the City Council's redistricting map is a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
But even Rhoades is not all-powerful. 
</P>
<P>
When a Chicano Federation attorney asked him to review videotapes of a council 
session to check for slippery dealing, Rhoades admitted he's never mastered the 
VCR: 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to have to clue my wife on what you want me to watch." 
</P>
<P>
* Pay me now, pay me later. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Taylor and Jean Andrews are partners in a San Diego political consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor helped draw the proposed redistricting map that could put Councilman 
Bruce Henderson's career greatly in doubt. The map may have delighted Linda 
Bernhardt (another Taylor-Andrews client) but it made Henderson howl in pain. 
</P>
<P>
Now Andrews is making fund-raising calls for Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
She's telling people that the redistricting map makes Henderson so vulnerable 
that he needs all the campaign help he can get.

SECOND SHOOTING LEAVES CABDRIVERS NERVOUS, ANGRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A 59-year-old Yellow Cab driver was shot and killed in Southeast San Diego on 
Saturday night -- the second shooting of a taxi driver in two days, police said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Brumlow, whom co-workers described as well-liked, was found slumped in 
the front seat of his cab, with the engine running, door open and lights on, at 
9:18 p.m. Saturday. The taxi had run up on a sidewalk in the 3900 block of 
Florence Street and stopped with its hood in a hedge. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that Brumlow had just dropped off a passenger when he was 
approached by two men, one in a red jacket and the other wearing black. Brumlow 
had picked up his passenger in National City, police said. There were several 
pedestrians on the sidewalk when Brumlow's passenger stepped out of the taxi. 
</P>
<P>
Police say Brumlow, a Clairemont resident, was shot in the head with a 
large-caliber handgun. He was dead at the scene. Two area residents alerted 
police after hearing a gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
Police are looking for motives for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence of robbery at this time," said San Diego police spokesman 
Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Brumlow, who had driven a taxi for the past two years, is survived by his wife, 
Nobuko, and their two children, Mike, 21, and Nora, 25. Brumlow, who had worked 
as a warehouse foreman, preferred driving a taxi, even though he worked the 
night shift, his son said. 
</P>
<P>
"My father liked driving a lot; he liked people and liked his job," said Mike 
Brumlow. "He never mentioned being afraid." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting comes on the heels of another. A man shot a Yellow Cab driver near 
San Diego State University and stole his cab Friday afternoon. The victim, San 
Diego resident William Joseph Tufford, 47, was shot once in the back with a 
.22-caliber pistol. Tufford had picked up his passenger in Pacific Beach and 
taken him to the 5100 block of Yerba Santa Drive near Montezuma Road. 
</P>
<P>
Tufford was listed in fair condition Sunday night at UC San Diego Medical 
Center, said nursing supervisor Jane Swett. 
</P>
<P>
Police do not know if robbery was a motive in Friday's shooting, Robinson said. 
The assailant was described as a man in his early 30s with long, blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication that the suspect involved in the Friday afternoon 
shooting was involved in this one on Saturday," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have offered $1,000 awards for information leading to an arrest in 
either shooting. Anyone with information is asked to call 235-TIPS. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow Cab is also offering a $5,000 award for information in either case, said 
company official Anthony Palmieri. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings have rattled most drivers, leaving them feeling vulnerable, said 
company employees. 
</P>
<P>
"You are always encouraging people to be careful, watch who they pick up. But 
you are vulnerable all the time -- like a cop," said one of Brumlow's 
colleagues, who asked that his name not be used. "Put yourself on our side of 
the fence -- if it was one of your co-workers, how would you feel?" 
</P>
<P>
As word of the weekend shootings spread, drivers expressed both fear and anger. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't shot, but I could have been -- we have all been there at one time or 
another," said Suzette Williams, a dispatcher for Orange Cab, who worked for 
five years as a driver and was robbed twice at gunpoint. "It's a dangerous job 
but we all do it. And over the past couple of years, it has gotten worse." 
</P>
<P>
Williams and other cab workers agreed there was little that companies could do 
to safeguard drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not taking any precautions," said Greg Bird, a dispatcher for CO-OP 
Silver Cab. "Some drivers shy away from high-risk areas and some don't care." 
</P>
<P>
Drivers themselves said they will be more cautious when they pick up 
passengers, though they acknowledged that there was a limit to what they could 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not required to take anyone that might be a danger, or if they're drunk. 
And I won't take anyone who won't give an exact address," said Michael 
Hamilton, a Yellow Cab driver who started working as a driver in San Diego in 
1970. Hamilton, like others, said he would like to see safety shields to 
protect drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking some precautions. I don't work the late hours. I look at the 
individual. I'm a pretty good judge of character," said Adolfo Franco, a driver 
with Checker Cab, who was waiting for possible passengers outside the Greyhound 
Transportation Center. 
</P>
<P>
Afraid of drug- and gang-related activities in Southeast San Diego, Franco said 
he did not like traveling to the neighborhood where Brumlow was killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to stay away from there. If you put yourself in the middle of something 
like that, something is bound to happen," Franco said. "I don't know of any 
taxi driver that will go into that area."

<P>
The Fillmore City Council has renewed its agreement with the Fillmore Area 
Transit Company to provide bus service within Fillmore and around the county 
for fiscal 1990-1991. 
</P>
<P>
The transit company offers bus service five days a week to Piru, Santa Paula 
and Ventura, including a direct commuter service to the County Government 
Center. The company also offers service around the city of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the route within city limits, the county subsidizes between 60% and 
80% of the cost of the bus service. The city will pay $101,600 for service in 
1990-91, nearly half its allotment of state Transportation Development funds.

COUNCIL STUDIES ROAD FEE WAIVERS

<P>
The Moorpark City Council is considering waiving road improvement fees for 
churches and other tax-exempt organizations that want to expand their 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current policy, commercial builders, including churches, must pay 
between $1,560 and $3,553 per acre to improve roads and other public services 
near their developments. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves the new policy at its July 25 meeting, it would be a 
financial windfall for at least two Moorpark churches. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Chapel Foursquare Church, which moved in January from Walnut Street to a 
new $200,000 building on Los Angeles Avenue, could receive a $5,000 refund if 
the policy is approved. 
</P>
<P>
And Moorpark Presbyterian Church, which will build a 23,000-square-foot complex 
under a plan approved by the council last week, would not have to pay about 
$25,000 in road improvement fees. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the church been planning for the past five years to build the 
complex, which will contain offices, classrooms and a meeting hall, on a 
seven-acre site at Peach Hill and Spring Road. Last week, the Rev. David 
Benefiel said the fee waiver would be a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Organizations, including some nonprofit hospitals, would be eligible for the 
fee waiver if they are exempt from paying taxes under federal laws. PSYCHE

PANEL BACKS WATER RATE INCREASE OF 44% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Public Utilities Commission staff has recommended Southern California 
Water Company be allowed to raise average residential water bills in Ojai by 
44% over the next three years under a newly proposed rate structure tailored to 
encourage water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai City Manager Andrew Belknap said the city has no position on the proposed 
rate increase because he has not received details that were requested three 
weeks ago from the water company. He said the city remains strongly opposed to 
the company's initial proposal to raise water bills an average of 41% over 
three years without inducements to save water. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is scheduled to begin final hearings on the two rate hike 
requests this morning at the State Office Building in Los Angeles. A decision 
on approving one of the two proposed rate increases is expected in October. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Water Company said it prefers its initial plan, which would 
raise the average monthly residential bill of $31.86 by $6.15 next year, 
another $3.71 in 1992 and by an additional $2.59 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the rate hike, the company would double the basic monthly service 
charged to each customer over three years. The basic fee does not change with 
the amount of water used. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council complained in April that raising the basic fee would penalize 
those who use less water without providing an incentive to others to conserve. 
After promising to revise its plan, the water company waited until a commission 
hearing in Ojai June 25 to unveil an alternative proposal to encourage 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
In the alternative plan, the company's 2,688 Ojai customers would pay only 5% 
more on their basic fee along with higher rates for increased water use. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai customers who conserve water would experience a lesser increase on their 
bills under the alternative plan, but many customers would face much higher 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the average household's water consumption, now $31.86, would 
increase by $10.62 next year under the alternative plan, compared to a $6.15 
jump under the original 41% rate-hike proposal. 
</P>
<P>
After a routine investigation of the company's records, the utilities 
commission staff released four reports this week concluding that both the water 
company's initial 41% increase and the 44% increase with water conservation 
incentives are fair rate hikes based on reasonable profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
But commission project manager Richard Tom said that under the proposal that 
would increase rates with water usage, some Ojai citrus growers might opt to 
dig new wells instead of paying higher water bills. He said the water company 
may need to oppose any more private wells in the San Antonio Creek areas where 
its own wells are located. 
</P>
<P>
The commission staff also recommended the company not be allowed to spend money 
to hire another service employee or buy a new service truck as is budgeted next 
year. "The company renders good service and is quick to respond to customers 
who have a complaint," the staff report said. THIA BELL

BAN ON DRINKING IN PARKS TO BE WEIGHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council will consider tonight whether to ban drinking in three 
downtown parks. 
</P>
<P>
The request to ban alcohol use in the Downtown Mini-Park, Valdez Alley and 
Eastwood Park came last week from the Ventura Parks and Recreation Commission, 
said Bill Byrets, recreation superintendent for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a number of complaints from tourists, downtown businesses and 
residents who say they are tired of being assaulted by a bunch of drunks," 
Byrets said. "It's reached a point where people are reluctant to come downtown 
because of a small group of transients that basically hang around and drink all 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Posting no-drinking signs in the three parks would allow police to enforce laws 
against drinking in public, Byrets said. Although police patrol the area 
frequently, alcohol-related problems continue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, a drinking ban is enforced at only two of the city's 23 parks, 
Byrets said. Alcohol is banned at Surfers Point and after sunset at Grant Park. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez Alley, which connects Main Street with Cedar Street, and Eastwood Park, 
located at Cedar and Poli streets, pose particular problems because they are 
isolated. The Downtown Mini-Park, off Main Street, is more accessible, but the 
presence of drunks scares many people away from the business district, Byrets 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Groups are able to get permits to drink in those parks during special 
occasions, Byrets said. CAROLYN KUSKY

PLANS OKD FOR NEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: CONEJO VALLEY OFFICIALS SAY THE $4-MILLION FACILITY WOULD BE THE 
MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED IN THE DISTRICT. 
</P>

<P>
The Conejo Valley Unified School District has approved initial plans for a 
$4-million elementary school in Thousand Oaks that would accommodate up to 600 
students. 
</P>
<P>
The school, to be built at Knightsbridge Avenue and Whitechapel Place would be 
the most technologically advanced in the district, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be equipped for computers in each classroom so that we don't have to 
go back later and tear up everything to put them in," said Dolores Didio, a 
member of the school board. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Los Angeles-based architectural firm of Flewelling &amp; 
Moody last week presented the board with blueprints that call for a 
52,000-square-foot, U-shaped building with 21 classrooms and a central 
courtyard. More detailed plans will be presented once board members decide next 
spring when to build the school. 
</P>
<P>
The school will also contain an oversized classroom with capacity for about 30 
computers and science lab equipment, said Scott Gaudineer, the project's 
principal architect. An in-house cable system, which would allow teachers a 
choice of various educational programming simply by changing the television 
channel, will also be installed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to anticipate what they will need for the next 50 years," 
Gaudineer said. "The hardware may come later, but the building will be wired 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
Ideas for the new school were compiled from a committee of nine school 
officials who met three times to discuss the plans. 
</P>
<P>
Officials anticipate the need for a new elementary school in central Thousand 
Oaks -- possibly as soon as September, 1992 -- to educate 600 kindergarten 
through sixth-grade students who are expected to move into the Lang Ranch 
housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 2,257-unit tract has started, but a completion date will 
depend on supply and demand, according to officials of the Lang Ranch Co., 
which is donating a nine-acre site for the new campus. 
</P>
<P>
Developers' fees will pay for the school, officials said. STEPHANIE STASSEL

CANYONS SEEN AS DUMPS -- OR AS PARKLAND; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: COMPETITION IS GROWING BETWEEN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS 
CONSERVANCY AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICTS, TWO AGGRESSIVE 
AGENCIES WITH CONFLICTING PURPOSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To some people, deep canyons are refuges for wildlife, buffers against sprawl, 
places to take a hike. To others, they are ideally suited to provide a basic 
service as receptacles for trash. 
</P>
<P>
This conflict of needs and values has spurred a land rush between two 
aggressive public agencies with vastly different goals. One is the Los Angeles 
County Sanitation Districts, which disposes of waste water and trash for 78 
cities in the county, and now is prospecting in the Santa Clarita and northern 
San Fernando valleys for remote canyons to use as landfill sites. 
</P>
<P>
The other is the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state parks agency that 
covets some of the same real estate for parks and trails. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot like a race and frankly, I hope the conservancy wins," said 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like everywhere we go, they show up," said Joe Haworth Jr., a 
Sanitation Districts spokesman. Because parks and landfills both "involve open 
space, we're bound to bump into each other sooner or later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lately they've been bumping into each other with regularity, which could prove 
a political problem for the smaller and less potent conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's collision with the districts could affect an ambitious 
proposal to raise money for improving county parks, beaches and museums. The 
proposed $816-million bond issue includes about $90 million for the 
conservancy, and county supervisors must decide by early next month whether to 
put it on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by the turf battle, Supervisor Deane Dana has insisted that there be 
language in the measure barring the conservancy from spending bond funds for 
land wanted by the districts. Even if that restriction is included, Dana has 
not said whether he will support putting the proposal before voters. 
</P>
<P>
The fallout has spread to Sacramento, where the conservancy and its legislative 
allies recently were forced to scale back trail-building plans under pressure 
from the districts. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a proposed expansion of the Rim of the Valley Corridor, including 
lands surrounding Elsmere and Towsley canyons, both potential landfill sites in 
the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The corridor is a zone in the local mountains where the conservancy has 
authority to create horse and hiking trails. It has no power to restrict 
landfills or other projects there. Still, the districts feared the corridor 
designation could be ammunition for anti-dump forces in future landfill siting 
battles. Areas around Towsley and Elsmere were dropped to avoid risking a 
legislative committee veto of the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
But the conservancy's efforts to acquire land sought by the districts have won 
kudos from many officials, particularly those facing the prospect of new 
landfills in their jurisdictions. "People . . . are going to be desperate for 
recreational land in this growing county," said Carl Boyer III, a city 
councilman in Santa Clarita, where officials fear environmental damage if 
landfills are developed. "I think the conservancy has basically done their best 
under a very, very tough situation." 
</P>
<P>
The Sanitation Districts "have never seen a canyon that they didn't want to 
fill up with trash," said Hunt Braly, chief of staff for Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa 
Clarita). As for the conservancy, "they continue to do an exemplary job," said 
Braly. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their skirmishing, sanitation and conservancy officials speak of each 
other with a measure of respect. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any desire to try to characterize what they're doing," said 
Donald S. Nellor, chief of planning and engineering for the districts' solid 
waste management department. "They're a public agency attempting to fulfill 
their mandate . . . and so are we," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rare in government, they have long-term objectives," said Joseph T. Edmiston, 
executive director of the conservancy, referring to the Sanitation Districts. 
"Unfortunately, their goals were pretty much decided in the late '50s," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The districts plan to create at least two big landfills from among four 
candidate sites: Elsmere, Towsley and Blind canyons in the Santa Susana 
Mountains above Chatsworth, and Mission-Rustic-Sullivan, a network of three 
canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Due to objections by conservationists and influential Westside residents, the 
canyons in the Santa Monicas are almost untouchable, which has increased 
pressure on Elsmere, Towsley and Blind. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report on the suitability of the four sites will not 
appear in draft form until at least next month. But the districts have wasted 
no time in trying to lock up all of the land they can. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, conservancy officials say they are out to preserve parks, not 
block landfills. However, their pursuit of that goal appears to have knocked 
the Blind Canyon site out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the conservancy stunned the Sanitation Districts by reaching an 
agreement with entertainer Bob Hope to purchase his 4,369-acre Runkle Ranch, of 
which Blind Canyon is a part. Conservancy officials said the acquisition 
preserves a vital wildlife corridor linking animal populations in the Santa 
Susanas, Simi Hills and Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation Districts officials had been negotiating with Hope for years and are 
thought to have offered substantially more than the below-market $10 million 
the conservancy will pay. The deal is contingent on approval of a big golf and 
residential project on Hope's Jordan Ranch property in eastern Ventura County. 
But for now at least, Blind Canyon is beyond the Sanitation Districts' reach. 
</P>
<P>
However, the districts have the upper hand at Towsley on the other side of the 
Santa Susanas. They have optioned about 900 acres in Towsley, while the 
conservancy -- which wants Towsley for the proposed Santa Clarita Woodlands 
State Park -- has been unable to obtain land in the canyon proper. 
</P>
<P>
However, the conservancy has acquired 145 acres near the mouth of the canyon, 
in effect blocking the best access road for trash trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"They are in the way of what we believe to be probably the most suitable 
access," said Nellor, adding that an alternative access route is possible. 
</P>
<P>
The competition between the agencies began last year over the other two sites, 
Elsmere and the Santa Monica Mountains canyons. Los Angeles city and county 
officials were negotiating creation of a landfill at Elsmere, to be run by the 
Sanitation Districts. The conservancy did not try to snap up the Elsmere site, 
but insisted that the destruction of Elsmere be mitigated by transferring to 
conservancy ownership the three canyons in the Santa Monicas, which are owned 
by the county and the districts. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy joined forces with BKK Corp., a private waste disposal firm 
that held land and options at Elsmere, in an effort to enhance each party's 
bargaining strength. BKK ultimately accepted a lucrative buyout offer from the 
city and county. The city and county, however, also agreed to preserve at least 
two of the canyons in the Santa Monicas if Elsmere becomes a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Berg, director of the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics at USC, said the 
conflict suggests the need for regional government to resolve land-use 
conflicts. "You've got to have landfills and . . . you need parks as well," he 
said. Following their legal mandates, both agencies are "looking to solve one 
of these problems and not all of them," Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, according to Berg, area sanitation officials have been slow 
to inaugurate recycling and waste-reduction programs, thus aggravating the 
problem. "They've got to get far more aggressive in trying . . . to cut this 
waste stream drastically," Berg said. "They never really liked to do that, and 
I understand that it's difficult, but come on, this is a new world." 
</P>
<P>
At the headquarters of the Sanitation Districts in Whittier, however, the word 
is that recycling is not a magic wand to make the problem vanish. There will 
always be stuff left over, Nellor says, and hence a need for landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Through a window in his office looms a towering terrace of trash. It is the 
districts' Puente Hills landfill -- one of the two largest landfills in the 
country and a good backdrop for a gloomy scenario. 
</P>
<P>
By late 1991, Nellor said, trash could be piling up on sidewalks. This could 
happen if expansion of existing public and private landfills, including 
Sunshine Canyon above Granada Hills, is not approved. Remaining dumps will 
still have years of capacity, but with fewer sites available, trash trucks 
could face long lines and collection could become less regular. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long haul, Nellor said, a state law requiring at least 50% of waste to 
be diverted from landfills by the year 2000 should help out a lot. Even so, he 
said, population growth and shrinking dump capacity require at least one new 
landfill by the year 2000 and another by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the most popular work, Nellor acknowledged. "I think it's obvious 
that park development is an easier type of project to implement than the public 
service provided by a landfill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need parks. We need places to dispose of our refuse," he said, "and the 
same people that need the parks produce the refuse that needs to be disposed 
of." 
</P>
<P>
A lean, cautious engineer, Nellor's personal style, along with his mission, 
contrasts with that of the more free-wheeling and passionate Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent sweltering afternoon, Edmiston four-wheeled into Towsley Canyon, 
bumping along a rutted road to a point where the high canyon walls narrow to a 
gorge. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a breathing space, OK?" he said. "We're giving future generations an 
option about what to do. If this canyon is filled in the next five years, there 
won't be an option in 30 years to decide." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, it is not his job to back off "so that people can throw away as many 
McDonald's . . . containers" as they want "and not worry about it," Edmiston 
said. "That lifestyle has been pretty much discredited."

190 CHILDREN AT HOUSING PROJECT JOIN HANDS, HEADS, HEARTS, HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In summers past, television and trouble filled most evenings for children at 
the San Fernando Gardens housing project in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
So when VISTA volunteer Rosa Roman started making phone calls and knocking on 
doors, gauging parents' interest in a pilot 4-H club within the housing 
project, the response overwhelmed her. More than 190 children signed up for 
4-H, and 35 were enrolled in the club's first project, arts and crafts, when 
the first meetings were held in temporary Quonset hut quarters last week. 
</P>
<P>
The newest 4-H club in the San Fernando Valley, which its leaders said provides 
one of the only diversions for the project's youths, represents a shift in 
direction for the organization in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
It has neither freckle-faced farm children nor award-winning heifers, but its 
members seem as excited as any 9-year-old planting his first beans in 
anticipation of the county fair. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last Thursday, Sandy Sanchez, 12, already had something to be 
proud of: a neatly stitched flower petal taking shape on an embroidery hoop. 
</P>
<P>
She also had been elected by the children gathered in the housing project's 
stuffy Head Start building to lead the arts and crafts group, which will meet 
daily from 5 to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"The teacher said we need a leader that wants to be a leader," she said 
proudly. "I got to be it." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy said she already likes 4-H, especially since it meets in the late 
afternoon. During the day, she said, she cares for her 2-month-old brother, and 
"I usually don't come outside." 
</P>
<P>
Deirdre Thompson, the county cooperative extension 4-H agent who oversees the 
new club, admitted that there have been failures at some other housing projects 
because parent volunteers sometimes cannot be recruited, or grants to pay for 
supplies and leaders' stipends were lost. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she is optimistic about the club in the San Fernando Gardens, 
because youth activities there are scarce and parents fear letting their 
children venture into the dangerous neighborhoods nearby for outside recreation 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We already have four adult volunteers and we've got a captive audience, so to 
speak," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
The arts and crafts project, the first undertaken by the new club, is only the 
beginning, said VISTA volunteer Roman, who lives in the housing project. 
Projects soon will be established in camping, foods and nutrition, computers 
and football, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here, they are real happy," Roman said. "They want the kids to 
learn something."

NEW IMMIGRANT KILLED BY TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Guatemalan woman was killed in Van Nuys when she was struck by a pickup truck 
at Van Nuys Boulevard and Valerio Street, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A suspect, Oscar Valdez, 31, of Burbank, fled the Saturday night accident but 
later turned himself in, said Officer Bill Mulvihill of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The pedestrian, also 31, arrived in Los Angeles three days ago from Guatemala, 
Mulvihill said. Her identity was withheld until relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez was charged with vehicular manslaughter. He told police he did not see 
the woman, or the traffic signal changing, and fled because he panicked.

AUSSIES RISE ABOVE FLAT WAVES AT LIFE'S A BEACH 
</P>

<P>
Australian residents Martin Potter, Pam Burridge and Nat Young have just about 
as much experience on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals' world tour as anyone 
in their divisions. 
</P>
<P>
So when the waves south of the Oceanside Pier, which had been fairly consistent 
throughout the week, turned mushy and flat during Sunday's final rounds of the 
$112,500 Life's A Beach contest, Potter, Burridge and Young cashed in on some 
of that experience to win. 
</P>
<P>
Potter, the defending world champion, won the men's division in a rout over 
Hawaii's Sunny Garcia, 74.8-53.5. Potter scored well on four of his first five 
waves -- contestants are judged on their four best waves out of a maximum of 15 
in the finals -- and Garcia managed just two good rides throughout the 
30-minute final. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he would do differently if he could have the final to do over, 
Garcia answered simply, "Catch some waves." 
</P>
<P>
For Potter, who is a citizen of Great Britain, it was his first victory in six 
events this season and 13th in 10 years on the world tour. He earned $10,000 
and 1,400 tour points to move from 12th to seventh with 5,008. Australia's 
Robbie Bain, who finished tied for fifth, remained the tour leader with 6,592 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning the world title last year, you know, I came out surfing thinking like 
I had to defend the title (in every event)," Potter said. "When you try to 
defend something, it's almost twice as hard winning. I ended up putting a lot 
of unnecessary pressure on myself. I made a lot of mistakes early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
"This was sort of a barrier for me to try to stop putting the pressure on 
myself and just go out and start surfing, which is what I did last year." 
</P>
<P>
Burridge, who holds a number of ASP records including most appearances (87) and 
most top eight finishes (nine), convincingly defeated Florida's Lisa Anderson, 
76.3-60.3, in the women's division, despite catching only five waves to 
Anderson's nine. 
</P>
<P>
It was also Burridge's first victory of the season after finishing second three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a string of second places which I walked away quite happy from. And I 
didn't like that," Burridge said. "I wanted to prove to myself that I could win 
an event again and be worthy of it. Lisa's been, I guess, the form surfer 
lately, and she's been stopping people in her tracks. So I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
Burridge won $3,500 and increased her leading tour points to 6,814. She is 
trying to win her first world title after finishing second a record four times 
and third three times in nine years on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
While Potter and Burridge are 25 and 24, respectively, Young is 43, and had to 
go against 14-year-old Joel Tudor of San Diego -- the youngest finalist ever in 
an ASP contest -- as well as Dale Dobson of Oceanside and Stuart Entwistle of 
Australia in the four-man final of the longboarding division, the first such 
ASP competition ever held on the United States mainland. 
</P>
<P>
Young, the defending world champion, won $4,000. Dobson was second, Tudor third 
and Entwistle fourth. 
</P>
<P>
While the others paddled about trying to find a hot spot, Young stayed close to 
the pier throughout and caught the most waves of the day, 11. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that Pottz (Potter) and I had in common -- consistency," Young 
said. "As far as wave selection, my feeling is, the only time a wave is over is 
when it's a ripple on the sand . . . when it totally dissipates. There wasn't a 
lot of waves, but you do your best with what you've got."

Team tactics paid off for Evan Teske and Mark Hoffenberg as they finished 
one-two in the men's 30-34 Criterium at the Great Earth Masters National 
Cycling Championships Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In the race, which consisted of over 100 cyclists, Teske and Hoffenberg worked 
together with teammates Tom Broznowski (of San Diego) and Danny Van Haute (of 
San Marcos) to take control of the field. (Broznowski and Van Haute race for 
Cycles Veloce). 
</P>
<P>
Teske crossed the finish line in 1:23.25 with Hoffenberg close behind. 
</P>
<P>
"We were planning to get a break away going with two to three guys and 
hopefully lap the field," said Teske, who rides for Nissan/Schwinn. "We wanted 
at least two guys in the top three." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hoffenberg, who rides for Vita-Crunch/Schwinn: "We wanted to send guys off 
in pairs. Danny and I were a pair and Tom and Evan were a pair. We just wanted 
the team to do well." 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the 47-lap, 60 kilometer race Broznowski and Steve Wood (of 
Brentwood), riding for Velo Club LaGrange, broke away from the pack and held 
the lead for eight laps before being absorbed by the field of racers. 
</P>
<P>
Wood again broke away, this time solo, with eight laps remaining in the race, 
but five laps later he dropped back into the pack. Wood finished third. 
Broznowski remained in the front of the field with two laps remaining but fell 
back and failed to place. 
</P>
<P>
"I did my best to get away because I'm normally not a very good sprinter," Wood 
said. "Then a big hole opened up." 
</P>
<P>
Teske was in the center of the pack when he saw his chance to break free. 
</P>
<P>
"I was boxed in really bad," Teske said. "Somewhere half-way down the stretch a 
hole opened up and I turned on the after burner." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hoffenberg: "When there was 100 meters to go and I saw my teammate's 
jersey, I was pretty confident it was Evan, I knew it was going to be a one-two 
finish. Evan just barely beat me. It was so close." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffenberg had to rely on teammates to move ahead, because as the defending 
national champion he wore the red-white-and-blue jersey and was being 
challenged by other cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with wearing this jersey is they're not willing to let me go," 
Hoffenberg said. "With 10 laps to go I fell back and tried to remain 
inconspicuous." 
</P>
<P>
Last year Teske placed 13th in the Criterium, 10th in the road race and 10th in 
the time trials. He will be competing in the road race but decided not to do 
the time trials this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really just a criterium rider, a sprinter but I'm basically going to the 
road race to help the team," Teske said. 
</P>
<P>
Teske felt he had a good chance of winning, coming off two victories at a 
Masters Criterium in Temecula last weekend. He won the 30+ criterium and a 
category I-II race. 
</P>
<P>
A collision on the final stretch of the women's 35-39 race had a definite 
effect on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
The eventual winner was Karen Hornbostel of Louisville, Colo. with Camille Hood 
of Katy Texas close behind. 
</P>
<P>
Meg Berry (of Vista) and former national champion Betsy King (of Gainesville, 
Fla.) collided then crashed into the sideline fence and were unable to finish 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
There was a discrepancy among cyclists as to what actually occurred in the 
collision. Moments following the crash King began blaming it on Hood who was 
actually ahead of the group when the crash occured. 
</P>
<P>
King immediately left the race site and according to Race Director Mike 
McCollum, King went to the hospital with a deep puncture wound in her arm. 
</P>
<P>
Berry, who lost consciousness, was treated by American Red Cross medics for a 
badly bruised arm and abrasions on her hip. 
</P>
<P>
"I was passing everyone. I was coming on the inside of Betsy King. She knew I 
could win so she plowed me into the fence. I was going about 40 miles an hour 
when I hit," Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Linda Stein (of Laguna Beach) who was riding my wheel said she saw Betsy plow 
into me then someone ran into her. Betsy said that someone ran into her but she 
was the one to hit me first." 
</P>
<P>
Local rider Tisha Whitney, of Irvine, who rides with San Diego Cyclo-Vets, won 
the national title in the women's 40-44 race in 56:47.

MEDAGLIA PICK OFFS WIN FOR WEST ALL-STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like most of his teammates, Joey Medaglia stood along the railing of the West 
dugout in the bottom of the ninth inning of the District 20 All-Star Game on 
Sunday, trying to stir up a rally. 
</P>
<P>
Medaglia's revelry was broken when West Coach Tom Pedersen yelled his name. 
Medaglia looked at Pedersen with a blank stare. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what he wanted at first," said Medaglia, an outfielder from 
Agoura who had exited the game in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
What he wanted was for Medaglia to re-enter the game at first base as a 
pinch-runner, and in the blink of an eye, Medaglia was picked off by East 
pitcher Sean Henson. 
</P>
<P>
Henson's throw, however, was in the dirt and eluded first baseman Robert Flores 
and Medaglia scooted to third, where one out later he scored on a double by Joe 
Tushnet to hand the West a 6-5 victory at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
It marked a reprieve for both Medaglia and West, which appeared to have the 
game in the bag, leading 5-2 entering the ninth. But Harold Turk surrendered a 
single to Henson and walked Marlon McKinney and Chris Prince to load the bases 
with none out. 
</P>
<P>
A balk, sacrifice fly and Brian Esquival's clutch run-scoring single tied the 
game, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
Kendial Armstrong started the final West comeback, reaching base on a fielding 
error then leaving in favor of Medaglia, who scored the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
First-round pairings for the district playoffs, which open Tuesday, were issued 
after the game. First, however, Panorama City (17-5) must play Verdugo Hills in 
a make-up game today at 5 at Monroe High. 
</P>
<P>
If Panorama City wins, it will play Quartz Hill (18-5) on Tuesday at 4 p.m. at 
Birmingham. If Panorama City loses, it plays Woodland Hills East (19-4) at 
Birmingham at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills West (19-4) will play Lancaster (16-7) at 4 p.m. Tuesday at 
Pierce College. Top-seeded Sun Valley (19-4) plays its first-round game 
Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. against Newhall-Saugus (15-8) at Birmingham.

THE BLUE LINE: ITS REAL TEST BEGINS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR and VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The $877-million Los Angeles-Long Beach Light Rail Line today faces its biggest 
challenge yet, when commuters decide whether to park their cars and ride the 
shiny high-tech trolleys on the so-called Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by a weekend of inaugural hoopla that lured standing-room-only crowds 
onto the quiet-running electric trains, transit officials said the public seems 
to be convinced that the trains are safe, efficient and fun to ride. But the 
real test, they said, comes this morning when commuter runs start. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that we don't set our expectations too high," said Neil 
Peterson, executive director of the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission, the agency that built the line. "People won't change their habits 
in a day or a week or a month. We have to be patient for this new alternative 
to take hold." 
</P>
<P>
The weekend ridership total approached an estimated 80,000, and transit 
officials said the trains were performing almost flawlessly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be wonderful for commuters," said Joyce Cox of Long Beach, who 
was riding the train Sunday with her husband and daughter. "It beats gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
Although the weekend operation went smoothly, transit officials were cautious 
about predicting the future of the Blue Line -- the first step Los Angeles has 
taken into rail transit since the Big Red Car trolleys went out of business in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
Attracting big crowds to see and ride the big trolleys for the first time is 
one thing, officials said. But getting thousands of loyal, paying customers to 
use the train daily is another matter. To develop a loyal ridership, the Blue 
Line must prove that it can offer safe and reliable train service, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Commuter trains begin running today at 10-minute intervals along the 19-mile 
route. Service each day is scheduled to begin at 5:30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m. 
Each two-car train can carry up to 450 passengers and the ride from end to end 
is expected to take 55 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. The Blue Line is the initial link in the county's plan for 
a $5-billion, 150-mile rail network connecting suburbs to downtown Los Angeles. 
If the line fails to attract enough riders or becomes too costly, officials 
say, the county might scale back its ambitious rail transit plans in the coming 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, transit authorities projected that 30,000 commuters a day would ride 
the Blue Line once it started and that ridership would rise to 54,000 within a 
decade. But they have scaled back those predictions for the start-up period. 
They said they will be happy with an initial ridership of 5,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
For the first two weeks, rides will be free to encourage passengers. Then, 
officials said, a basic one-way fare of $1.10 will be charged, with special 
65-cent discount fares for the elderly and handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets will be dispensed by automatic vending machines that display operating 
instructions in English and Spanish on bullet-proof video display terminals. 
There are no ticket collectors, so passengers will ride on the honor system. 
Cheaters will be cited and fined $80. 
</P>
<P>
The basic fare is about half the price charged by the Southern California Rapid 
Transit District for express bus service between downtown Los Angeles and Long 
Beach. In addition, RTD bus transfers will be honored, transit officials said. 
The RTD is operating the Blue Line for the Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Special shuttle buses will be operating at ends of the line because the last 
stations are still under construction. For the next year, the last stop in Los 
Angeles will be the Pico Station at Pico Boulevard and Flower Street downtown. 
In Long Beach, the line will end at the Anaheim Station, pending completion of 
the four-station Long Beach Loop this fall. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest worries on opening day is that the trains, which can travel 
up to 55 m.p.h., will be slowed by traffic congestion, RTD officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Los Angeles, where the Blue Line travels down Washington Boulevard, 
the trains must stop for traffic lights at 20 intersections. 
</P>
<P>
"Our trains are getting caught at the red lights . . . and it's really slowing 
us down," said Arthur Leahy, RTD assistant general manager for operations. He 
has asked the Los Angeles Department of Transportation to adjust the 
computer-synchronized traffic signals to give the trains longer green lights, 
but city officials have been reluctant to give the train preference over 
motorists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The safety of having trains running down the middle of streets in Los Angeles 
and Long Beach has been questioned by the union that represents RTD bus and 
train operators. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Clark, United Transportation Union general chairman, has told the state 
Public Utilities Commission that the 20 intersections without crossing gates 
are "a major threat to life and limb." 
</P>
<P>
County Transportation Commission officials disagreed, contending that the line 
is safe. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Blue Line runs through high crime areas of the city, the commission 
hired the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to protect the line and is 
spending more than a third of the line's $33-million-a-year budget for 
security. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy emphasis on security appeared to pay off over the weekend, officials 
said. Deputies reported only two arrests -- one for disturbing the peace, the 
other for tearing down a "no trespassing" sign and possession of narcotics 
paraphernalia -- and officers broke up one fistfight. There were no reports of 
gang activity or vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"We are surprised at how quiet the weekend has been," said Sheriff's Capt. 
Frank Vadurro, head of the newly formed Transit Services Bureau. The unit 
deployed 200 deputies who rode the trains, walked the station platforms and 
patrolled the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Many of last weekend's riders came from poor and working-class neighborhoods, 
such as Watts, and officials said they expect the Blue Line to remain popular 
with many of the diverse neighborhoods along the route. 
</P>
<P>
"The Blue Line was located where it is expressly to serve the widest range of 
ridership possible," said Peterson. "Who better needs transit service than the 
people in low-income neighborhoods?" 
</P>
<P>
Peterson expects that 80% of the train riders will be from blue-collar 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the trips will not be end-to-end white commuters," he said. "Most will 
be generated in midline, people riding from Compton to Watts, from Washington 
Boulevard in the garment district to Artesia." 
</P>
<P>
The weekend excursion runs, with fully loaded trains running every 10 minutes, 
provided a shakedown for the coming weeks, the RTD's Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
"This weekend went great, it was picture-perfect," said Leahy, who started as 
an RTD bus driver 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, there were only two minor glitches, officials said. One car lost 
its brakes and had to be taken out of service; another was sidetracked briefly 
because doors would not close for about five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The next test comes today, when RTD will integrate the train operations with 
the RTD bus lines and start shuttle service at the ends of the train line. The 
RTD has set up 60 bus lines to feed passengers into the Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy is cautious about saying how long it would take before commuters accept 
rail transit in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The real value of Blue Line won't become apparent until it links to (the Metro 
Rail subway) Red Line and Green Line (down the Century Freeway)," he said. "The 
more rail we have, the more we can adjust the bus lines to feed into the 
system. Then we'll get some idea of how successful we've been."

Blue Line Traffic Signals 
</P>
<P>
The "T" signals indicate to the train operator when safe movement is 
permissible but are not visible to automobile traffic. The "arrow" signals 
control automobile traffic making left-hand turns. It is extremely important 
automobiles make a left-hand turn only when a green arrow is visible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rall vehicle Warning Sign 
</P>
<P>
Lets you know that you are approaching an intersection where the Blue Line 
crosses. 
</P>
<P>
Make left-hand turn only when arrow permits you to. 
</P>
<P>
Safety suggestions for drivers crossing Blue Line tracks: 
</P>
<P>
Do not take shortcuts across the tracks by going around or under the railroad 
crossing gate. 
</P>
<P>
Do not ignore train signals. Stop when the railroad crossing signals sound. 
</P>
<P>
Do not cross track intersections without looking both ways. 
</P>
<P>
Warning signs are posted on streets approaching train crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Flashing red lights at rail intersection are a warning to stop. 
</P>
<P>
Stop at least 15 feet from the nearest rail when a train is coming. 
</P>
<P>
Never get trapped on a crossing. When traffic is heavy, wait off the tracks 
until you are sure you can clear them. 
</P>
<P>
Do not go ahead until you can see clearly in both directions. There may be a 
second train coming from the other street.

POOR FEELING THE PINCH AS LOW-RENT HOUSING SHRINKS

<P>
For home buyers, this city ranks among the most expensive in the country: 
$182,300 for a typical one-family home. Developers are searching everywhere for 
land to build fancy homes for families with fancy incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Their search has led them all the way to the Dudley Station area, on the edge 
of Roxbury, the largely black inner city of Boston. A few years ago, the Boston 
Redevelopment Authority announced that it planned to invest $750 million in the 
Dudley Station neighborhood. Speculators descended immediately to buy up 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"Without one spade being put in the ground, one brick being put into place, 
housing costs have tripled in six years," said Mel King, a political science 
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a defeated candidate 
for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Boston middle-class whites are still too fearful to move to the inner city. But 
the dream of gentrification in the future has already made housing too 
expensive for many poor people in Dudley Station. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the people who used to live in the area? "Some people moved . 
. . others doubled up," King said. "There's no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
Poor people nationwide are finding the same thing: There's no place to go when 
wealthy city dwellers set their sights on their neighborhoods. Homelessness has 
become a more serious problem than at any time since the Depression. And now it 
is driven in considerable measure not only by poverty but by wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"The last major outbreak (of homelessness) occurred as a consequence of the 
worst economic crisis in American history; the current situation exists in the 
midst of national prosperity literally unparalleled in the history of the 
world," sociologist James D. Wright asserts in his book "Address Unknown: The 
Homeless in America." 
</P>
<P>
Gentrification is only one cause. Drugs and alcohol have thrown countless 
people onto the streets. The mentally ill, no longer automatically housed in 
institutions, make up another category of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But many Americans are homeless simply because there is no affordable housing 
for them. To paraphrase what President Calvin Coolidge once said about 
unemployment: When a great many people cannot afford to live anywhere, 
homelessness results. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the homeless are broken-down alcoholics, but most of them are not," 
Wright said. "Some are mentally impaired, but most of them are not. Some are 
living off the benefit programs made available through the social welfare 
system, but most of them are not. Clearly, none of the popular mythologies 
provide an adequate portrait of the homeless in America today." 
</P>
<P>
In Wright's view, inadequate housing is responsible for most of the nation's 
homelessness. The addicts and the mentally ill, he says, only obscure the fact 
that many of the homeless are ordinary Americans down on their luck. 
</P>
<P>
If he is right, the crisis has an obvious cure -- more low-rent housing. But 
that requires massive amounts of money, and support for affordable housing has 
dwindled since the Ronald Reagan Administration cut deep into federal housing 
subsidies nearly a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The number of low-rent housing units, as defined in a recent report by the 
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Low Income Housing Information 
Service, declined by 19% from 1970 to 1985. During that same period, the number 
of officially poor persons grew by 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows how many homeless Americans there are. Estimates range from the 
Housing and Urban Development Department's 350,000 to the National Coalition 
for the Homeless' 3 million. Regardless of their exact number, a large 
proportion of the homeless are unmistakable in all the nation's major cities -- 
sleeping in parks, panhandling at subway stops, living in single-room-occupancy 
hotels and other shelters. 
</P>
<P>
On the nights of March 20 and 21, pairs of U.S. Census Bureau enumerators 
counted the people who "appear to be homeless" as they entered soup kitchens 
and places where social service officials in 490 census districts said the 
homeless were likely to spend the night. But critics insist that the 
enumerators missed many of the homeless. The census figures, when finally 
released in a year or so, are sure to be denounced as inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, a professor at Tulane University, has reviewed existing studies and 
examined the homeless populations in 12 large U.S. cities. He offered a 
"reasoned guess" of somewhere between 500,000 and 750,000 people who are 
homeless every night and three or four times that many who are so poor that 
they could become homeless virtually any night of the year. 
</P>
<P>
By Wright's accounting, six Americans in every 1,000 will become homeless 
during their lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
"By any standards, all the estimates point to a national disgrace, clearly 
unacceptable in a rich, humane society," said Peter H. Rossi, acting director 
of the Social and Demographic Research Institute at the University of 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Many poor people, unable to find work and pay rent, have avoided homelessness 
by moving in with relatives. But crowded homes are often tense, and unhappy 
homes and householders sometimes show the door to relatives who are unable to 
pay their share of the rent. 
</P>
<P>
That happened to Willie Williams, a 41-year-old janitor at a homeless center in 
Philadelphia. Unemployed and unable to pay rent, Williams, his wife and their 
two children moved in with his sister. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the kind of woman that, as long as you do what she says, everything is 
fine," Williams said in an interview. After a year, she evicted his family, and 
they had to take shelter for six months. For Williams, the homeless episode led 
to both a job and federally subsidized housing. But not all the homeless are so 
fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless have always been among us. At the turn of the century, migrating 
workers and recently arrived immigrants found their ways into the cities 
without a place to hang their hats. The number of people without permanent 
addresses grew enormously during the Great Depression; the Federal Emergency 
Relief Administration housed upward of 125,000 people in its transient camps 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
While World War II created a boom in employment, homelessness persisted. Hobos 
rode the rails, and Skid Row bums concentrated in the seedy parts of most U.S. 
cities. They were out of sight of most of the middle-class population. By 
contrast, many of today's homeless are clearly visible. 
</P>
<P>
"These, truly, are the poorest of the poor -- the new homeless -- and they are 
best seen as the victims of large-scale social and historical trends assuredly 
not of their own making," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
The old homeless were typically male, white and 50 or older. Today, experts 
estimate that at least one-third of the homeless are women and children. A 
disproportionate number are black, Latino and American Indians. The adults are 
typically younger than a generation ago, more likely in their 30s than their 
50s. 
</P>
<P>
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Low Income Housing 
Information Service reported that there were 9.7 million housing units in 1970 
that were within the budgets of the nation's poor. By 1985, the groups said, 
the number had declined to 7.9 million. Their report defined poor families as 
those with incomes of less than $10,000 in 1985 dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that the typical poverty-level household in 1985 had an income 
of about $5,000 and spent 65% of it for rent and utilities. That left "only 
$145 per month -- or less than $35 a week -- remaining for all other cash 
expenses for all household members." 
</P>
<P>
Fully 85% of renters, the report said, paid more than 30% of their incomes 
toward rent -- HUD's standard for the maximum share of income that should be 
devoted to housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Large declines in household incomes and increases in housing costs have driven 
housing out of the affordable range for many low-income households," the report 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
In cities across the country, community organizations are struggling to hold 
the line against the destruction of low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Boston, the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative, organized by Gus 
Newport, the former mayor of Berkeley, Calif., is buying all the abandoned and 
vacant lots it can in the largely black Roxbury neighborhood. The organization 
is racing against gentrification, hoping to give residents less reason to fear 
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
On the edge of Roxbury, Alphonse Mourad, a Lebanese-American landlord who lost 
his boyhood home in Boston to gentrification years ago, is still fighting -- 
and still losing. Mourad bought a 276-unit low-rent apartment building from HUD 
several years ago and promised the tenants that if he could recoup his 
investment, he would sell the building to them. Otherwise, Mourad insisted, the 
building eventually would be sold on the open market and then demolished to 
make way for high-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Mourad changed the identity of his apartment building by erecting a sign that 
stands vertically in white relief against the red brick: M-A-N-D-E-L-A. By 
renaming the complex after South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, 
Mourad hoped to inspire pride among the 1,500 predominately black, low-income 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
That worked: The residents planted flowers, formed security patrols to force 
out drug dealers and prostitutes and organized a tenant-management committee 
that tried to preserve the place for low-income dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
But the tenants were unable to raise enough funds to buy the building. Mourad, 
claiming he could not afford the assessed taxes, could not make his mortgage 
payments a few months ago and lost control of the development. He predicted 
that developers would eventually drive out his low-income tenants. "Right now, 
this area . . . is a prime location," Mourad said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., the Lutheran Church's Trinity Housing Project has 
purchased and upgraded 20 ramshackle apartments for use by homeless families. 
Project director Mary Lou Tietz said that families are selected from about 13 
family homeless shelters in Washington for the one-, two- and three-bedroom 
apartments in which they live until permanent housing is found for them. 
</P>
<P>
Operating with an annual budget of about $215,000 from HUD, the project seeks 
to relocate homeless families from welfare hotels and overcrowded shelters and 
to give them an opportunity to become independent within two to three years. 
The transient house known as Trinity Arms, a comfortable building nestled amid 
federal government offices and dilapidated inner-city houses, opened in July, 
1988. The first seven families at Trinity Arms have moved into apartments of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the families that have come here are headed by single mothers," Tietz 
said. "They can't afford day care and housing costs on their limited salaries. 
Obviously they wouldn't be homeless unless they've suffered from a lot of 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
One Trinity Arms resident is Doris Pryor, 40, who lives with her 14-year-old 
son and twin 5-year-old granddaughters in a three-bedroom transient apartment 
that she rents for $80 a month. Her rent is slightly more than one-quarter of 
the $300 she earns per month baby-sitting for neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment is a colorful place filled with bric-a-brac, family photographs 
and wildlife prints. "I like to decorate," she said with a proud smile and a 
sweep of her arm to usher visitors into the living room. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been moving around so much," she said, ticking off some half a dozen 
residences over the last decade. Just before moving into Trinity Arms, she had 
spent two months at the General Scott Inn, a motel serving as a homeless 
shelter. Before that, she lived with her mother in a house that provided 
shelter for a total of four adults and 16 children. 
</P>
<P>
"After a year, she told me I had to go," Pryor said. "Like a mother, she had 
tried to take all the children in." 
</P>
<P>
Tietz said that Pryor eventually will have to leave Trinity Arms and find a 
permanent place of her own. But Pryor dreads the idea of moving out. 
</P>
<P>
"The past is just like something I'm trying to forget," she said, her head 
sagging. "I'm trying to move ahead now." 
</P>
<P>
The Lutheran project is not a comprehensive approach to the problem of the 
homeless in Washington. It does little more than give temporary shelter to 
perhaps two dozen homeless families who are still searching for permanent, 
inexpensive housing. 
</P>
<P>
For the bulk of the homeless, experts agree on what is needed: more low-cost 
housing. That might not entice all the drifters and alcoholics and addicts off 
the streets. But it would address the predicament of Pryor and the countless 
homeless like her. 
</P>
<P>
Some states and cities, including New Jersey and Amherst, Mass., require 
developers to include moderately priced housing in their plans as a condition 
for zoning and building permits. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the sums of money being made on real estate development, this does not 
seem an untoward or onerous restriction," Wright wrote. "Perhaps some federal 
matching money could be targeted for large-scale development projects to 
increase the number of low-rent units to be built." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, some cities are considering whether to increase their financial 
commitment to low-cost housing. In Atlanta, Jared Samples, a 23-year-old city 
councilman who grew up in one of the city's public housing projects, says that 
his advocacy of more affordable housing accounted for his election. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 1968 there's been no more public housing in the city of Atlanta," he 
said. "Why can't you float a revenue bond to build affordable housing? The 
population in public housing is growing from within. We need to create 
something to provide some housing for some of these people." 
</P>
<P>
But most analysts believe that only the federal government has the wherewithal 
to address the problem. Wright said that "a renewed federal commitment to 
subsidized construction of low-income units" is the most efficient answer to 
housing the homeless. "I think, roughly speaking, that would cost about $100 
billion over the next decade so that by the year 2000, we would have an 
adequate supply," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Ronald Reagan was President, financing for low-income housing was 
substantially trimmed. The number of families receiving federal housing 
assistance -- those living in public housing or receiving rent subsidies -- has 
more than doubled from about 2 million in 1977 to 4.5 million now, according to 
the Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the growth was fueled by commitments made before that period. New 
commitments to build public housing or provide rent subsidies fell from 375,000 
in 1977 to a recent low of 78,000 in 1983 before leveling off at 100,000 for 
this year and the previous two. 
</P>
<P>
Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, releasing a U.S. Conference of Mayors survey 
last fall that found increasing levels of hunger and homelessness in 27 big 
cities, observed that "it has not been the politically fashionable thing up on 
Capitol Hill to help poor people." 
</P>
<P>
There was one exception. In 1987, Congress enacted the McKinney Homeless 
Assistance Act, the first comprehensive federal law aimed at homelessness. The 
act provided funds for a medley of 16 programs, including support aimed at 
alleviating the problems of the homeless. The programs -- some funding private 
agencies, others acting through state and local governments -- supported 
shelters, food distribution, job training, health care, drug treatment and 
other activities. 
</P>
<P>
But Reagan signed the bill into law only "with reluctance." Congress then 
appropriated less than the total sums of money authorized by the McKinney Act 
-- $388 million for 1989, for example, compared with an authorization of $634 
million. And the federal agencies responsible for administering the programs 
delayed releasing the available funds until housing advocates won a series of 
federal court rulings in Washington in 1987 and 1988 that forced them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush, during one of his 1988 campaign debates with Democratic 
presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis, called for full funding of the 
McKinney Act. Since moving into the White House, he has come close to keeping 
his word. Congress appropriated $607.4 million in 1990, close to what the 
President requested. For 1991, the President has asked for an increase to $749 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of federal efforts on behalf of the homeless are not impressed. The 
McKinney Act, they point out, does nothing to address the fundamental problem 
-- insufficient low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the new -- and welcome -- rhetoric, the Administration's proposals 
fall far short of providing a serious response to homelessness," according to 
an analysis of the McKinney Act by the National Law Center on Homelessness and 
Poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"Funding is still inadequate."

the ranks of the homeless. Homelessness -- some of which is attributable to 
drug and alcohol abuse -- has become more serious than at any time since the 
Depression. But, as a series on Poverty in America explains, many in the U.S. 
are homeless simply because of a lack of affordable housing. A homeless man in

MOSCOW MASSES JEER PARTY AND URGE DEFECTIONS 
</P>

<P>
Tens of thousands of Muscovites, massing outside the Kremlin walls, poured 
contempt on the Communist Party on Sunday and called for wholesale defections 
from its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
In the style of an old-time religious revival meeting, speaker after speaker 
took the microphone to announce his decision to quit the party and call on 
former comrades to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear friends," renegade KGB Gen. Oleg Kalugin told the cheering crowd, "today 
I, like tens of thousands if not millions of Communists, closed a chapter in my 
biography and quit the Communist Party of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
After a pause to allow the roar of approval to subside, Kalugin went on to 
condemn the party leadership for bringing the country to the brink of ruin and 
declared, "We have to say 'No!' to this party." 
</P>
<P>
Kalugin and other speakers denounced the 28th Communist Party Congress, which 
ended on Friday, for failing to undertake the radical reforms of the Soviet 
political system that they believe are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin, the mayors of Moscow and 
Leningrad and several other well-known political figures quit the party as the 
congress ended, adding impetus to the mass resignations already under way. 
</P>
<P>
The party's radical Democratic Platform faction, which announced Thursday its 
decision to break off and form its own party, is drawing away reformists. 
</P>
<P>
No new nationwide figures have come out on how many of the party's 18 million 
members have turned in their red cards. From January to mid-June, 186,000 
members had quit; although amounting to little more than 1%, the figure was a 
record for that amount of time, party officials said. And the trend then moved 
upward. 
</P>
<P>
The rally, which Soviet television estimated drew about 50,000, was several 
shades more hostile in its anti-Communist rhetoric than other similar protests 
in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
It highlighted the growing movement among radical reformers to abandon working 
from within the Communist Party and to try instead to form a potent and 
uncompromising opposition from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
"We call on all Communists who have not done so yet to cut their ties with this 
shameful organization and leave," said Arkady Murashev, an opposition member of 
the Congress of People's Deputies, the national Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the major opposition group, the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies, 
had refrained from head-on attacks on the party. Murashev's call signaled a 
readiness for open political battle. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that brought us here was to express our contempt for the party forum 
that just finished," Sergei Bilozertsev, another opposition deputy, said, 
evoking a chorus of derisive whistles from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, ranging from teen-agers flying the black flag of anarchism to 
elderly Red Army veterans with chests full of medals, stretched across the 
square in front of the main entrance to Red Square. The rally, which had begun 
with a 45-minute march from Gorky Park, continued for more than three hours 
despite a cool, beating rain. 
</P>
<P>
Waving signs that said "Throw the Communist Party Onto the Trash Heap of 
History" and "Honorable People, Quit the Communist Party," they chanted "Down 
with the Communist Party!" and "Down with the KGB!" 
</P>
<P>
The rally's tone got so angry at times that organizers and some Muscovites 
admitted it made them uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Objecting to calls for a public trial of the party and its leaders, a woman 
standing near a line of police officers guarding access to the speakers' podium 
said, "God will judge the party. There's been enough blood." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, art historian Inessa Semenicheva, said the protest was a catalyst 
for the rising tide of party quitters but that the process is already moving 
under its own momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"The party is in agony. Our artists are leaving the party every day," 
Semenicheva said, referring to members of the Moscow Union of Artists. 
"Practically every day, they're turning in their cards." 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Boxer, one of the leaders of the Moscow Union of Voters, which 
organized this and several previous rallies, said he was concerned by the 
growing thirst for revenge he sensed. 
</P>
<P>
"Democratization will truly be assured only when the idea of revenge has no 
place at such mass meetings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was called to push for three specific goals: the creation of a 
national coalition government that would have the people's trust; the 
nationalization of party property, and the removal of party cells from the 
army, the police and the KGB, the security service. 
</P>
<P>
Radicals at the 12-day Communist Party congress of almost 4,700 delegates got 
nowhere on those issues and several others they raised, Democratic Platform 
leader Vladimir N. Lysenko told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The protest lived up to advance advertising as the largest Moscow rally since 
pro-democracy protests held outside the Kremlin in February. Those protests 
drew crowds ranging from 100,000 to more than 200,000 people. Protesters 
attributed the smaller turnout Sunday to the beating rain, the weekend exodus 
of many Muscovites to the countryside in the summer, and a general fatigue and 
frustration with politics. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers contributed their own creative proposals to the official rally 
calls, adding a note of humor to the hostility toward the party. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Ales Adamovich proposed that the Red Square mausoleum where Soviet Union 
founder V. I. Lenin's body is preserved be turned into a museum for holding all 
the party cards members are turning in these days -- until it is too stuffed to 
hold any more. 
</P>
<P>
Theater director Yuri Lyubimov suggested that the statue of Felix E. 
Dzerzhinsky, the KGB's founder, be removed from the square where it stands and 
stored in the agency's basement where innocent prisoners were held. The main 
KGB building should be painted black, he said, and turned into a memorial to 
all the people who died in it. 
</P>
<P>
Another speaker proposed that psychic Yuri Kashpirovsky, who is known for his 
television demonstration of hypnotism, use his amazing power of imposing his 
will to persuade viewers to turn in their party cards.

GERMAN MEMBERSHIP IN NATO.

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, emerging from a morning of talks with 
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, hinted strongly Sunday that Moscow is ready 
to accept NATO membership for a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"In the East-West context in general, much of importance has happened in the 
past months, (and) this new context opens the possibility for new 
understandings," Gorbachev told a group of reporters traveling with Kohl when 
asked about his stance on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in an interview with West German television, Kohl predicted that a 
breakthrough is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"We touched every question, and by noon tomorrow (today), I think we can come 
up with a series of very good results," the chancellor said. 
</P>
<P>
While important issues linked to unity must still be negotiated among the two 
Germanys and the four victorious World War II powers -- Britain, France, the 
Soviet Union and the United States -- Moscow's resistance to a united Germany's 
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization remains the biggest 
stumbling block to international agreement on the terms of reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Soviet domestic pressures, both from the military 
and conservative forces within his own Communist Party, have prevented 
Gorbachev from embracing the idea publicly, even though he is said to be no 
longer personally opposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives blame Gorbachev's reform movement for the collapse of communism 
in Eastern Europe and the end of the East German socialist state -- emotional 
issues here. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gorbachev's success at the recently ended Communist Party congress, 
coupled with a string of concessions from the West, have reduced this 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the West Germans and Soviets have reportedly drawn closer on 
another crucial point needed for Soviet acceptance of NATO membership for a 
united Germany: limiting the military strength of the future unified German 
state. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials said ahead of time that the two leaders would discuss 
troop strengths, and the presence of Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, chief of the 
Soviet general staff, at Sunday's news conference was seen as a sign that talks 
on this point had reached a detailed phase. 
</P>
<P>
At a summit meeting of NATO leaders two weeks ago, Kohl agreed to announce a 
maximum size for future German military forces when a conventional arms 
reductions treaty is signed in Vienna, most likely in November. 
</P>
<P>
However, to assure that German unity occurs with Moscow's blessing, Soviet and 
West German leaders have worked to find a mutually agreeable figure -- most 
likely 300,000 to 350,000 troops -- in advance of such a formal announcement. 
</P>
<P>
A strength of 350,000 would leave German forces just below the combined Soviet 
and American troop strength in Central Europe under new levels expected to be 
contained in the Vienna treaty. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany at present has armed forces of 495,000, while East Germany has 
about 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The size of this force and Soviet (possession of) nuclear weapons means this 
(limit) is not really meaningful militarily," commented a Western diplomat 
here. "But the question of (German) troop strength is crucial" to persuading 
the Kremlin to accept NATO membership for a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union now has 3.9 million people in uniform, including 360,000 in 
East Germany; under the proposed Vienna treaty, Moscow would be permitted to 
have 195,000 in Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Both Soviet and Western diplomats here interpreted Gorbachev's news conference 
comments as a sign that the Soviet leader is ready to move on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It indicates that maybe there is a solution," commented Soviet Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov. 
</P>
<P>
But it was as much the confident, almost buoyant, mood of the two leaders as it 
was their comments that indicated agreement is near. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet leader had earlier quipped to Kohl about his lack of sleep 
during the 12-day party congress, Gorbachev appeared brimming with confidence, 
joking with members of the West German delegation and stressing the need to 
forge a positive, cooperative relationship with a unified Germany. 
</P>
<P>
He described the initial round of talks during Kohl's two-day visit to the 
Soviet Union variously as "substantive," "good" and "constructive." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl sat with his hands folded during much of the 30-minute news conference, 
trying vainly to contain a broad grin. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the two leaders flew to Stavropol, Gorbachev's home in southern Russia 
1,000 miles south of Moscow, where they mingled with large crowds and laid 
wreaths at a large World War II memorial in that city. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also showed Kohl the office from which he once ruled the city as a 
relatively obscure regional Communist Party boss just over a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to conclude their talks today before Kohl returns 
to Bonn late this evening. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl is the first Western leader to accompany Gorbachev to his home area, and 
both Soviet and West German sources claimed the trip reflected the "good 
chemistry" between the two leaders. 
</P>
<P>
As they walked through the city's streets surrounded by large crowds of 
well-wishers, Gorbachev turned to his guest and said, "We're at an altitude of 
700 meters (2,300 feet) here, but we want our relations to go further upward." 
</P>
<P>
Then, pointing in the direction of 18,481-foot Mt. Elbus, the highest peak in 
the Caucasus range, the Soviet leader added, "It will take some time to reach 
the altitude of Elbus, but from our perspective we want to go even higher than 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Although strongly influenced by mistrust dating from the suffering of World War 
II, relations between the Soviet Union, Europe's largest nation, and a united 
Germany, which would be the Continent's richest and most technologically 
advanced nation, have enormous potential if they can develop positively. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's news conference, Gorbachev talked of the importance of a united 
Germany to the Soviet Union, noting that West Germany is Moscow's largest 
Western trading partner, while East Germany was this country's major Eastern 
European commercial link. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany recently agreed to guarantee a $3-billion credit line and pay $710 
million toward the cost of maintaining Soviet forces in East Germany for the 
remainder of this year, but German officials said that no further direct 
economic aid is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid possible accusations of a united Germany forsaking the West and 
turning East, Germans hope to commit additional financial aid to Moscow within 
a multilateral assistance package. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl pushed hard and won commitments to study possible aid to the Soviet Union 
from both the seven-nation economic summit that concluded recently in Houston 
and last month's meeting of European Community heads of government. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Gorbachev said they had discussed a formal treaty, possibly to be 
signed next year, that would provide the framework for future political and 
economic ties between the Soviet Union and a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that this is a historic hour," said Kohl. "We look forward, but 
without forgetting history."

WAR GAMES: Top-ranking Marine Corps generals gathered in mid-May for a secret 
two-day session to simulate what the Bush Administration has insisted is not in 
the cards: direct U.S. intervention in the South American drug war. 
</P>
<P>
The war game, directed by Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Alfred M. Gray Jr., was 
described by sources as a highly realistic exercise that pitted "blue" armies 
of the United States and the three Andean nations against "red" forces of 
narcotics traffickers. While details of the simulation remain classified, one 
officer said commanders considered a variety of possibilities because "you 
can't nail down a good counter-narcotics war scenario." 
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps officials insisted that the Quantico, Va., session was designed 
merely to educate, not plan. But other Administration sources said the meeting 
was part of a broader Marine effort to gain a leading role in an expanded 
military anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Marines had lost out when the Colombian government vetoed a 
plan to station rapid-deployment troops on U.S. carriers off its coast, the 
sources said the corps had made clear its determination to find another niche. 
"This is the biggest game going," one official said, "but so far, the Marines 
have mostly been sitting on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
NEWS MANAGEMENT: A series of backfires involving efforts to manage the news 
have set the White House to grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
White House aides traveled to the Houston economic summit primed to ballyhoo a 
new environmental initiative by Presdient Bush. Fact sheets had been prepared, 
and press releases were ready to go. The initiative -- a new global treaty to 
protect the world's forests -- was designed in part to counter negative 
publicity about Bush's refusal to allow strong language on global warming to be 
put in the summit's final declaration. 
</P>
<P>
But Chief of Staff John H. Sununu refused to allow White House staff members to 
announce the new plan until the other six summit leaders had agreed to it. The 
result? The initiative was overshadowed by other issues on the last day of the 
summit and largely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
The same fate befell another Bush initiative -- on Latin America -- two weeks 
earlier. The plan was to be released before the summit. 
</P>
<P>
But when Bush announced his decision to favor a tax increase, the White House 
rushed ahead with the release of the Latin American plan the next day. Sununu, 
aides said, hoped to divert attention from the tax flap. Instead, Bush's Latin 
plan was widely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not getting any kind of ride on our good stories," said one dismayed 
White House aide. Sununu, he added, "just wants to do it his way." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT, BUSH TIRED? After nearly two weeks on the road, President Bush spent the 
weekend at Camp David. And for the first time in recent memory, he admitted in 
public to being tired. 
</P>
<P>
After parrying reporters' questions for a few minutes before leaving the White 
House on Friday, he finally begged off, saying, "Hey, I'm tired. Come on. And 
so are the rest of you guys. I can tell by the quality of the questions." 
</P>
<P>
"You're actually tired?" a reporter asked incredulously of the 66-year-old 
chief executive, who seemed to think nothing of flying overnight to London, 
meeting there with allied leaders and then taking off about 30 hours later for 
a late-night flight to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'm tired. I am tired," Bush conceded.

TOHONO OODHAM RESERVATION, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The desert sun is hot enough to bend spoons, but it's cool and dark inside the 
adobe tack hut. Seven saddles hang from steel hooks on a ceiling crossbeam. 
U.S. Customs Service Agent Stanley Liston hauls one down and throws it over the 
back of a rust-colored horse. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the one I ride if I think I'll have to chase somebody down," says 
Liston, tugging on the cinch. "Coco's the fastest." 
</P>
<P>
It's early afternoon on the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation, 60 miles west of 
Tucson. Today, like all days, the odds are good that drug smugglers are out 
there somewhere in this rattlesnake-infested borderland. Liston's job is to 
find them. 
</P>
<P>
He is a Tohono O'odham Indian and a tracker. He grew up out here and knows 
every village and wash. He spends his days on horseback or in a big, 
four-wheel-drive truck. 
</P>
<P>
His boss, Tom McDermott, special agent in charge in Arizona, says that Liston 
is the best tracker in the Southwest. "His father did it and his grandfather 
did it," McDermott observes. "How good is he? Let me put it this way: If one of 
my children were lost in the desert, I'd want Stanley to be the one to find my 
child." 
</P>
<P>
The vast desert around here has become a drug-smuggling frontier. Packs of up 
to 14 smugglers -- some on horseback, some on foot -- haul marijuana and 
sometimes cocaine in bales bound with hemp-type ropes that double as shoulder 
straps. The gangs move at night and sleep during the day. 
</P>
<P>
As Liston bounces along a zigzagging trail that is a well-known smuggling 
route, he studies the ground for signs that a gang has passed. He is six feet 
tall and heavyset, with a strong build. He has a square face, a flat nose, cool 
brown eyes, and dark skin that is leathery from a life in the sun. His thin 
mustache is silver like his hair. After years in the saddle, his big legs bend 
out at the knees. On his belt he carries a .45-caliber pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Liston was born on a ranch three miles south of the Mexican border. His father 
taught him tracking. "I can remember my dad taking me into the desert when I 
was a little kid, teaching me what to look for," Liston says. 
</P>
<P>
In 16 years with Customs, Liston has seen every trick the smuggling gangs use. 
To shake a tail they sometimes rig their shoes with strips of carpeting and 
walk backwards. They may walk barefoot over a dirt road or brush out their 
tracks with broken branches. 
</P>
<P>
Liston uses tricks of his own. When he finds a set of prints, he rides over 
them on his horse or in his truck, then comes back the next day. If more tracks 
have been laid over his, then he has a time frame. Depending on whether the 
tracks are footprints or from horses, he can estimate how far a group has 
traveled in the last 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
He memorizes the sole patterns of different makes of shoes. He puts a broken 
greasewood branch in the cab of his truck and checks it after a day, then two, 
then three, each time remembering the way it looks and feels. If he comes 
across a greasewood branch on the trail, he knows how long it has been there. 
</P>
<P>
And he keeps a log, marking the day and time that tracks were made, how many 
horses passed, whether they were shod and the imprint of their hooves. By the 
depth of its tracks Liston can estimate how much dope a horse was hauling. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Liston has been in on countless arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Once he was trotting down a wash following a track and spotted three smugglers 
sleeping. Two of them heard him coming and bolted. The third, a heavy sleeper, 
didn't awaken until Liston was practically on him. The smuggler ran. Liston 
galloped after him, twirled a rope over his head and lassoed him. "He stopped 
when I got the rope round him," Liston says matter-of-factly. "If he didn't he 
would've been jerked off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Liston, who has three daughters, views his work as more than a job. "The last 
thing I'd want is for one of my kids to get involved in drugs," says Liston, 
51. "It's a real problem here on the reservation, especially in the schools. In 
the last three years it's gotten a lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of all the sophisticated radar and other equipment law enforcement 
uses to slow drug trafficking here, Customs agents say that one of the most 
effective deterrents is a man on a horse, eyeballing the ground.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration may soon find itself facing a foreign policy problem 
that it once considered unthinkable: a Khmer Rouge return to power in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials acknowledge that Khmer Rouge guerrilla forces have in 
the past several months made significant gains in the Cambodian countryside, 
militarily and politically. At the same time, the Vietnamese-installed 
government of Cambodia has seemed increasingly weak, in part because of 
financial problems resulting from reduced Soviet aid to Vietnam and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said repeatedly that the United 
States opposes a return to power by the Khmer Rouge. When the Khmer Rouge last 
ruled Cambodia, from 1975 to 1978, between 1 million and 2 million Cambodians 
are believed to have been murdered or to have died of starvation or illness. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States is also opposed to allowing the Cambodian government to 
fight the Khmer Rouge, mainly because of Cambodia's close ties to Vietnam, an 
old American adversary. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, since the early 1980s, the United States has been supporting a 
coalition of non-Communist groups joined in an uneasy alliance with the Khmer 
Rouge. The triumvirate, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a former Cambodian 
ruler, holds Cambodia's seat at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
There is growing sentiment in Congress to cut off aid to these non-Communist 
groups, at least until they separate themselves from the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to stop the Khmer Rouge is to not support their allies," said 
Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), the senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs 
subcommittee on Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Baker himself suggested last week that the Administration might be willing to 
reduce or end its longstanding support for Sihanouk's forces, support that now 
totals about $17 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair to say that we are rethinking the question of assistance to 
the non-Communist resistance," Baker said recently on ABC's "This Week With 
David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers are also urging the Administration to change a second element of 
the longstanding U.S. policy toward Cambodia -- Washington's refusal to 
recognize or deal with the Cambodian regime of Prime Minister Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have opposed Hun Sen and his Communist government for more than 
a decade, arguing that it is illegitimate because it was installed by force 
when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978. Vietnam withdrew most of its troops 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Some congressmen, among them California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), 
believe the United States should throw its full support behind Hun Sen's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to cut our aid to the non-Communist resistance," Levine said. 
"The sad fact is that there's no alternative to Hun Sen or the Khmer Rouge. 
None of us have any reason to believe Hun Sen is a Jeffersonian Democrat. But 
Hun Sen is the lesser of two evils, and we have to recognize that." 
</P>
<P>
Others favor prodding the two sides to cooperate in some sort of coalition. 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
subcommittee on Asia, said, "The only way to defeat the Khmer Rouge is to 
achieve an agreement between the non-Communists and the Hun Sen government." 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials contend that such a coalition would not work, 
because Sihanouk and his allies are incapable of working with the 
Vietnamese-backed government, which they have been fighting for nearly a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Another official argued that even if the two sides could form a coalition, it 
probably could not defend itself against the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese army couldn't eradicate the Khmer Rouge in 10 years with 
110,000 troops," he said, "and we know the Vietnamese army isn't bad. What 
makes anyone think Hun Sen and Sihanouk could do it on their own?" 
</P>
<P>
But the Administration's critics argue that even if this new approach doesn't 
succeed, it is still worth a try -- and is far better than the current policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our present policy in Cambodia is bankrupt," said Democratic Rep. Chester G. 
Atkins of Massachusetts. "Right now, we've got a fight between Hun Sen and the 
Khmer Rouge, and we're supporting the Khmer Rouge's battlefield allies. The 
Khmer Rouge is using Sihanouk as their cloak of respectability to go in and 
organize the countryside." 
</P>
<P>
How far should the United States go in trying to stop the Khmer Rouge? Some 
congressmen contend that the United States should begin to provide at least 
some military and intelligence support for Hun Sen's government and others 
fighting the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
But Administration strategists warn that such action might lead to renewed U.S. 
military involvement in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has been emphasizing the need for a political 
settlement. For the last year, Washington's strategy has been to try to 
persuade all the parties in Cambodia -- Hun Sen and his supporters, the 
non-Communist parties and the Khmer Rouge -- to join in a coalition government. 
The aim is to contain the Khmer Rouge by making it a political minority within 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has also been working with the United Nations to arrange an 
international peacekeeping force and a transitional government to serve until 
after democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
Richard H. Solomon, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific 
Affairs, has met several times with officials of the four other permanent 
members of the U.N. Security Council -- the Soviet Union, China, Britain and 
France -- and he is to attend another round of talks in Paris today. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, it was hoped that the Security Council members could use their 
influence to bring about a political settlement in Cambodia. For years, China 
has been supplying arms to the Khmer Rouge, while the Soviet Union has been the 
leading financial supporter and arms supplier to both Vietnam and the Hun Sen 
government. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Bush Administration strategists acknowledge that the prospects for a 
negotiated settlement are not good. 
</P>
<P>
"The Khmer Rouge says no to everything," a State Department official said. "And 
Hun Sen and the Vietnamese seem to be hardening their positions, too." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the Administration had little trouble persuading Congress to go 
along with its Cambodia policy. Leading Democrats, such as Rep. Stephen J. 
Solarz (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, 
and Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.), supported the President. 
</P>
<P>
But now that support seems to be eroding. Last month, Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) broke with the Administration, charging that its 
policy on Cambodia is "incredible" and "insupportable." Mitchell urged the 
Administration to talk with the Hun Sun government and provide it with 
development aid. 
</P>
<P>
In late June, a week after the House of Representatives voted to continue aid 
to the non-Communist resistance groups, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 
to cut off such aid. Congressional sources say the issue will be in doubt at 
least until September, when conflicts between the House and Senate can be 
worked out in a conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a bipartisan group of 10 senators -- including Robb and moderate 
Republicans John C. Danforth of Missouri, Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and 
William S. Cohen of Maine -- joined Mitchell in a letter urging the Bush 
Administration to alter course on Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration itself is deeply divided over Cambodia policy. A number of 
officials in the State and Defense departments say privately that they favor 
ending the U.S. effort to isolate the Hun Sun government. Indeed, although they 
are not willing to be quoted for the record, some Administration officials have 
taken the position that Washington should begin to normalize relations with 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is the White House," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest opponent of change is said to be Brent Scowcroft, the national 
security adviser, who in the early 1970s took part in the Nixon 
Administration's frustrated effort to negotiate an end to the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Administration officials still cling to the hope that they can 
persuade the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge to agree to some form of 
settlement supervised by the United Nations. But they acknowledge that the 
Khmer Rouge is making progress in rural Cambodia and that amid a series of 
financial and political problems, the Hun Sen government could collapse.

</P>
<P>
Diplomats from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the 
United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France -- will meet in 
Paris today for the fifth time to discuss Cambodia. The talks center on a plan 
for a U.N.-supervised cease-fire there, followed by a caretaker administration 
and elections. The U.S. hopes to achieve a political settlement that will 
prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to dominance and will lead to stability 
to Southeast Asia.

CARIBBEAN: ISRAELI SHIPMENT OF MACHINE GUNS AND RIFLES WOUND UP IN THE HANDS OF 
A COLOMBIA DRUG BARON.

<TEXT>
<P>
A festering scandal over illicit arms sent from Israel to Antigua last year and 
then mysteriously transshipped to the Colombian drug cartel has embarrassed 
Washington and Jerusalem and may bring down the corruption-ridden, family-ruled 
government of this Caribbean microstate. 
</P>
<P>
In the still-shadowy transaction, an illegal shipment of 100 Uzi submachine 
guns, 400 Galil assault rifles and 250,000 rounds of ammunition, ostensibly 
ordered for Antigua's 70-man Defense Force, went instead to Gonzalo Rodriguez 
Gacha, one of the top three barons of the Medellin drug cartel. Rodriguez Gacha 
was shot and killed last December by Colombian police. 
</P>
<P>
A purchase order purporting to legitimize the shipment and guarantee Antigua as 
its final destination bore the name of the elder son of Prime Minister Vere C. 
Bird, 81-year-old patriarch of the scandal-prone clan that has dominated this 
two-island Caribbean nation, formally called Antigua and Barbuda, since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no such post in Antigua, the document identified the son, 
Vere Bird Jr., as "minister of national security." Despite the irregularity of 
the guarantee, the fictitious title and the disproportionate quantity of arms 
for such a small security force, Israel apparently accepted the suspect 
document in place of the customary "end user certificate" routinely required in 
government-to-government arms deals, officials here said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way in the world that letter would be accepted by a government in a 
legitimate deal," one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Israeli complicity was also suggested by the presence of an 
Israeli army officer who escorted the arms to Antigua but raised no objection 
when, in an evidently prearranged switch, the arms were transferred with the 
help of Antiguan customs officials to a Colombia-bound ship only hours after 
they arrived on April 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A controversial Israeli entrepreneur, Maurice Sarfati -- sought by authorities 
in both Antigua and the United States after defaulting on U.S.-guaranteed loans 
of $1.3 million on a melon farm here -- and ex-Lt. Col. Yair G. Klein, a former 
anti-terrorist officer of the Israeli army who has been charged in Jerusalem 
with illegally providing military equipment and training to Colombians, are 
other key figures in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The gunshot-riddled body of a third Israeli, Arik Afek, a known Klein 
associate, was found stuffed in the trunk of a car at Miami International 
Airport last Jan. 24, and the Miami police are trying to determine whether he, 
too, was involved. 
</P>
<P>
When news of the arms scandal broke last April, following a formal diplomatic 
protest by Colombia, attention focused on Vere Jr., 53, as the key Antiguan 
official involved in engineering the scheme. His brother, Deputy Prime Minister 
Lester Bird, 52, was first to point a finger, not only implicating Vere Jr. but 
also hiring Washington lawyer Lawrence Barcella -- a former assistant U.S. 
attorney for the District of Columbia famed for tracking down rogue CIA agent 
Edwin Wilson in Libya in the early 1980s -- to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Lester Bird's hostility toward Vere Jr. is of long standing. In a struggle that 
has often assumed the qualities of a melodramatic soap opera, the millionaire 
brothers, both London-trained lawyers, have been vying "like Cain and Abel," as 
Vere Jr. once put it, to succeed their faltering octogenarian father, now 
serving his sixth five-year term as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Bird has remained largely out of the fray and out of public sight, 
shielded in recent years by his protective 27-year-old mistress, Cutie Francis, 
a powerful local businesswoman who has been at his side since she was a 
14-year-old beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
But protests concerning the arms scandal forced "Papa" Bird, as he is known 
here, to go public last month and order an official commission of inquiry, run 
by an impartial London jurist. The commission is scheduled to open hearings 
here today. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how the inquiry turns out, all three Birds may already have suffered 
fatal political damage from the arms scandal, according to opposition 
politicians and some of their allies in the Antigua Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
"This could mean the end of the Bird dynasty," said Baldwin Spencer, opposition 
leader in the 17-member Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
John St. Luce, minister of finance and longtime Papa Bird supporter, said: 
"People think the era of the Birds is over. It's not a monarchy, not a 
dynasty." 
</P>
<P>
Unless investigators turn up an innocent explanation of Israel's role in the 
incident, Jerusalem, too, stands to suffer from the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Although Israel may not have known that the guns were destined for the drug 
cartel, "they had to know the deal was fishy, that this wasn't a legitimate 
arms deal between governments," said an official who has closely followed the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
He said that ever since part of the arms shipment was discovered on the late 
drug lord's Colombian ranch last Feb. 2, Israel has been "dragging its heels" 
and offering only token cooperation to Antiguan investigators trying to unravel 
the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this just the tip of the iceberg?" asked the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. "Were there other shipments? What else are they trying 
to cover up?" 
</P>
<P>
He said that Washington, too, should be embarrassed and added: "The U.S. 
government has shown a clear lack of interest in clarifying this scandal. We 
have a good, clear trail here that can actually be followed and perhaps open 
other trails to the narco-traffickers, yet it's not being pursued. Why?" 
</P>
<P>
A Washington congressional source familiar with details of the scandal said he 
believes the Bush Administration has so far stood aloof because it does not 
want to make diplomatic trouble for Israel or get entangled in an explosive 
internal quarrel here that might endanger agreements that permit highly 
secretive U.S. Navy and Air Force bases to operate without restriction. 
</P>
<P>
If Klein, the former Israeli army officer, can be believed, Washington may be 
covering up its own role in the affair. Klein's link to the drug lords was 
disclosed last year when a U.S. television network showed him supervising the 
arms training of men Colombian authorities identified as drug cartel assassins. 
He said a few weeks ago, in an unsworn statement, that it all began with plans 
to build a "survival school" on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Klein told the Miami Herald that the deal grew out of a 1988 attempt 
to establish a base on Antigua where pro-U.S. rebel forces could be trained to 
topple former Panama strongman Manuel A. Noriega. He said he had no contact 
with U.S. officials in planning the never-activated training base but that the 
anti-Noriega Panamanians involved in the deal might have had. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department says it has expressed "concern about these arms" to 
Israel. Richard Boucher, a department spokesman, said in early May: "We are 
clearly concerned when government-licensed weapons end up in the hands of 
narcotics trafficking organizations. We urge governments involved to 
aggressively investigate the incident and take appropriate judicial action." 
</P>
<P>
Antiguan officials doubt that their commission of inquiry will get enough 
cooperation from either Jerusalem or Washington to untangle the intrigue behind 
the arms transfer. But they are confident that the involvement of local 
conspirators will be revealed.

President Bush is considering the appointment of an independent commission to 
review NASA operations in the wake of problems that have shaken confidence in 
the nation's space program, Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Sunday Bush may decide this week to name a panel of experts to 
conduct a broad assessment of NASA programs, one of several options pursued in 
recent days by Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National Space 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Among the spate of embarrassing revelations from the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration in the past month: The Hubble Space Telescope, touted as a 
revolutionary new eye on the universe, turns out to be near-sighted. Days 
later, the space shuttle fleet, the centerpiece of the U.S. space program, is 
grounded by an elusive fuel leak. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, reports indicate the space station Freedom, envisioned as 
leading space exploration into the next century, may be too heavy and need too 
many repairs to be feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the appointment of a review panel, one Administration official said: 
"To the degree that a shuttle screw-up or the Hubble failure undermines public 
confidence in the program doesn't help, but it's not the main focus." 
</P>
<P>
The White House could provide no timetable for a decision by Bush on steps to 
address the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Officials acknowledged the proposal for an independent review was prompted in 
part by worries about funding prospects on Capitol Hill at a time when Bush is 
urging Congress to back projects estimated to cost upward of $300 billion.

The District of Columbia spent $859 per person for criminal and civil justice 
-- four times the national average -- the year it became the nation's murder 
capital, according to a Justice Department report. Washington assumed the 
unofficial title as the nation's murder capital in 1988 when it recorded 369 
homicides, highest per capita for any major U.S. city.

A LONG RIDE FOR THE 'FATHER OF THE BLUE LINE'; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SUPERVISOR KENNETH HAHN FOUGHT FOR DECADES TO BRING BACK TROLLEY 
SERVICE. HIS PROPOSAL TO SEEK HALF-CENT SALES TAX HIKE TO FUND THE SYSTEM PUT 
L.A. BACK ON TRACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since the Red Cars stopped running in 1961, politicians talked about 
reviving a version of the trolleys in Los Angeles County. But there were 
disputes over the routes and financing -- and years passed without action. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever politicians turned to the public for money, they got turned down. 
County voters in 1968, 1974 and 1976 rejected transit taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who rode the Red Cars as a boy, remained 
committed to bringing back trolleys to his transit-dependent South-Central Los 
Angeles district. "I said I have to show my voters what I am able to deliver to 
them," recalled Hahn, a member of the board since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Hahn asked his fellow county Transportation Commission members to put 
on the ballot a half-cent sales tax increase to pay for transit. 
</P>
<P>
"No one thought he had a chance," Supervisor Ed Edelman recalled, noting that 
Hahn's proposal came just two years after passage of the tax-cutting 
Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
The tax was a tough sell, Hahn said in a recent interview. On the last day for 
placing a measure on the 1980 ballot, he had to recess the commission meeting a 
number of times to cut deals for votes. To win the support of commission 
representatives of small cities, he amended his proposal to allocate a share of 
the tax revenues to municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid parochial squabbling, he included in the ballot measure a map showing 
that funds would go to the construction of lines throughout the county. 
Finally, Hahn proposed using a large chunk of revenues from the tax increase to 
lower bus fares -- a step the supervisor said was essential to appeal to 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy paid off. Commissioners decided to put the measure on the ballot 
-- by a one-vote margin. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn took charge of the campaign to win voter approval. He raised funds. He 
sometimes went to bus stops to urge riders to vote for the transit tax. The 
measure, Proposition A, was approved with 54% of the vote. It later survived a 
court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn then lobbied to get the Los Angeles-Long Beach line built first. He said 
he took transportation commissioners to the top of City Hall to show them it 
was the only route with an open right of way. He argued that it could be built 
faster and cheaper than other routes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have wasted too many years and too much money on studies for expensive 
subways and monorails and other costly ideas when we already have a transit 
system that is only growing weeds when it should be moving people," Hahn told 
the commission in September, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-Long Beach route also had powerful political allies. Supporting 
it were then Democratic Assemblyman Bruce Young of Cerritos, who chaired the 
Assembly Transportation Committee, and then-Caltrans Director Adriana 
Gianturco, a rail enthusiast who served under Gov. Jerry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
When the successful San Diego-to-Tijuana trolley, built for about $86 million, 
became operational in 1981, the pressure increased to get something similar 
quickly running in Los Angeles. Young authored a bill allowing Caltrans to 
purchase portions of the Los Angeles-Long Beach rail right of way and begin 
engineering for its own project. 
</P>
<P>
County officials in 1981 were warned that if they did not begin a project 
quickly, they would lose millions in state transit dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argued at the time that these factors weighed so heavily on the minds 
of commissioners that they proposed the light-rail line as a matter of 
political expediency rather than good planning. 
</P>
<P>
"They are doing it because they have some money and they have to spend some 
money on rail and this is an area that is politically desirable," then-Los 
Angeles Planning Director Calvin Hamilton said in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, who is now chairman of the County Transportation Commission, said that 
the Los Angeles-Long Beach line "was sold to us (as) the quickest and least 
costly." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn recalled that he argued the Blue Line would be a "faith line to show 
people we can deliver mass transit." 
</P>
<P>
On March 24, 1982, the county Transportation Commission gave the green light 
for the Los Angeles-Long Beach line. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hahn was conspicuous among the politicians shaking hands and mugging 
for the cameras at a preview ceremony for the Blue Line, marking Los Angeles' 
historic return to rail transit. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the father of this," said RTD President Nick Patsaouras.

BLUE LINE: OPERATORS PICKED FOR THE L.A.-TO-LONG BEACH TROLLEY HAD TO LEARN HOW 
TO DRIVE WITHOUT A STEERING WHEEL AND OTHER NEW RULES OF THE ROAD.

<P>
After driving buses for 30 years, Walter Wadlington has pretty much mastered 
the rules of the road. 
</P>
<P>
But a few months ago, the veteran Southern California Rapid Transit District 
driver found himself going back to the basics. As one of 43 train operators 
selected for the new Long Beach-to-Los Angeles Light Rail, Wadlington had to 
acquaint himself with the rules of the rail and with operating a train. 
</P>
<P>
"The class was the hardest part of the training," Wadlington said. "But 
everything else seemed to flow after the classes." 
</P>
<P>
For an intense four weeks, train operators say they learned everything they 
ever wanted to know about the highly touted Blue Line cars that began operating 
Saturday, sharing streets with cars along much of the 19-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
The initial classes, taught in RTD's Division 11 rail yard in Long Beach, gave 
an overview of the rail system, said Ed Vandeventer, superintendent of 
instruction. Then instructors spent a great deal of time teaching the train 
operators how to negotiate intersections and crossings along the congested 
traffic corridors. 
</P>
<P>
After this was mastered, Vandeventer said the operators then learned about the 
various parts of the cars and how to respond in cases of emergency. The biggest 
adjustment, according to the operators interviewed, was getting used to driving 
without a steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of steering wheels each train operator uses a throttle switch that 
controls speeding and braking, Vandeventer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Line features an electronic safety system that uses sensors in rails 
to detect pedestrians, vehicles or other movement on the line, then transmits 
that information to the train operator and central control facility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
These sensors tell the operators the maximum allowable speed to ensure proper 
spacing between the cars to avoid rear-end collisions and cause barrier arms at 
intersections to close as trains approach, Vandeventer said. 
</P>
<P>
But the focal point of the training was to teach train operators how to 
function when the system malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically taught them trouble-shooting techniques," said Vandeventer, who 
has been with RTD for 15 years and with the Blue Line project since its 
inception. "We prepared them for what they will face on the rail." 
</P>
<P>
Through a series of "staged" accidents coupled with class instruction, the 
train operators learned to respond to a variety of emergencies, Vandeventer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The operators were trained to know what to do if a car breaks down," he said. 
"They also know the procedures for medical emergencies." Vandeventer said many 
of the train operators are concerned about the safety of a public not used to 
the trains. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the operators have told me that they are having trouble educating the 
public about the trains," he said. "This is a high-speed train and some people 
are getting too close to the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to constantly tell them they are dealing with a new kid on the block 
and that this kid can kill them if they are not careful." 
</P>
<P>
The group received training from supervisors who were taught how to operate the 
trains in Calgary, Alberta, Vandeventer said. He said the Canadian city 
operates a similar rail system. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the train operators are veteran bus drivers who were selected on the 
basis of seniority and work history, Vandeventer said. These drivers, who earn 
$15.73 an hour, will receive no pay increase in their new jobs. Before being 
selected, each operator had to undergo a series of tests, including a written 
exam on federal railway rules and a test of physical agility. 
</P>
<P>
Wadlington said he applied to become a train operator because he was becoming 
bored driving the bus. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for something different," he said. "This is like a new toy to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Other operators said they applied for their jobs because they were tired of 
driving in congested traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason I came on was because I wanted to drive but I didn't want to 
battle traffic," said Walter Burns, who has driven buses for 17 years and was 
out on a test-run last week. "This is going to be a good experience once I get 
used to everything. My biggest problem so far has been getting used to driving 
without a steering wheel and using a throttle." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the adjustments, Burns said he welcomes the new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"When something is new it always brings a period of adjustment," he said. "But 
eventually this will be routine. The public is going to love this. It's 
comfortable and you don't have to worry about traffic."

MAJ. GEN. JOHN BRUCE; HEAD OF UNMANNED SPACE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Maj. Gen. John Bruce Medaris, the military director of the nation's 
unmanned space program who after a seemingly miraculous recovery from cancer 
devoted his remaining years to the Episcopal priesthood, has died of the 
disease, it was learned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Medaris was 88 when he died Wednesday at his summer home in Highlands, N.C., 
after a long struggle against bone and lung cancer. The announcement was made 
by friends in Florida and reported by United Press International. 
</P>
<P>
He had commanded the Army's early space program, the Army Ballistic Missile 
Agency, when it orbited America's first satellite on Jan. 31, 1958. The program 
was soon turned over to the civilian control of the new National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Pat Patterson of Maitland, Fla., a friend of Medaris' for 47 years, said 
the former general had picked the nation's first team of space scientists, both 
military and civilian, "and I have never seen a team surpass that one." 
</P>
<P>
The historic team that built those first missiles was headed by German 
scientist Wernher Von Braun, father of the Saturn V rocket that was to send 
Americans to the moon and a pioneer in the development of Germany's wartime V-2 
rocket. Kurt H. Debus, the Kennedy Space Center's first director, was another 
team member. 
</P>
<P>
The expatriated German scientists that included Von Braun had been sent after 
the war to Ft. Bliss, Tex., and later transferred to the small north Alabama 
cotton town of Huntsville where Medaris became their commander. 
</P>
<P>
There was little sense of urgency about the nation's embryonic space program 
until the Korean War broke out in 1950. Then seven years later, on Oct. 4, 
1957, the Soviet Union launched the 184-pound Sputnik I, the world's first 
orbiting satellite. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 6, Medaris' team tried to respond by sending a three-pound satellite 
into orbit, but the Vanguard rocket which was to have propelled it rose two 
feet off its Cape Canaveral launch pad and exploded into a giant fireball. 
</P>
<P>
America finally got into space Jan. 31 when a Jupiter C booster hurled the 
31-pound Explorer I into orbit. The satellite discovered the Van Allen 
Radiation Belt. 
</P>
<P>
Medaris was born in Milford, Ohio, and at 16 lied about his age to get into the 
Marines. After a couple of years, he resigned and tried his hand at business, 
where he made but then lost a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Medaris entered the Army as a second lieutenant and came through 300 days of 
World War II combat unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
An ordnance expert, he served as chief of the first Army contingent to 
Argentina from 1949 to 1952, and in 1955 was named commander of the Ballistic 
Missile Agency. 
</P>
<P>
He became known as an aggressive, often arrogant commander who would roll over 
anyone in his way. He even carried a swagger stick for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1964, four years after retiring from the service, he was stricken with 
bone cancer and told he had only 18 months to live. Eighteen months later he 
was not only still alive, but the cancer somehow had gone into remission. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought had sometimes crossed my mind that perhaps a power, or whatever it 
was, was keeping me intact because there was some important job that I was 
destined to do," he said in a 1970 interview. 
</P>
<P>
He told the Los Angeles Times in a 1982 interview from Cape Canaveral, where he 
had gone as an honored guest to watch the launch of the space shuttle Columbia, 
that he decided to repay the debt by service to his church. 
</P>
<P>
He said he originally intended to become only an Episcopal deacon but "soon I 
found myself irresistibly forced into (other) situations." He thus became the 
Very Rev. John B. Medaris, rector of Anglican churches in Maitland and Orlando, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the International Aerospace Hall of Fame made Medaris a 
fellow, its highest award. The Army awarded him the first Medaris Award to Army 
Space Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the cancer resurfaced in 1970 but again went into remission, 
returning only recently. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had become a man of God, he did not lose the aggressiveness that 
had marked his military days and remained particularly critical of the 
decisions made many years earlier that separated military and civilian space 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the greatest mistakes we ever made."

generations ago by the legendary Red Cars of the Pacific Electric. The 34-mile

VICTIM, PREVIOUSLY HIT, FIGURED ODDS WERE IN HIS FAVOR

Matthew Edward Nordbrock had been struck by lightning once before. And as he 
sprinted for shelter from a gathering storm at the top of Mt. Whitney, he told 
his roommate and hiking companion, James Swift, that he wouldn't be jolted 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Yet inside a stone cabin near the Eastern Sierra summit, it was the 
bespectacled Nordbrock -- among more than a dozen huddled hikers -- who was 
fatally injured by the lightning bolt that struck shortly after 5:30 p.m. 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim (Swift) said the floor crackled and people felt their legs get numb," said 
Nordbrock's mother, Evelyn, a tax preparer in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
"Then everybody jumped up and were screaming, and they realized that Matt and 
another person were knocked down. The other person was revived right away, and 
they did CPR on Matt for four hours," she said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Her son's metal-framed glasses were blamed for contributing to his death. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told us they thought the lightning probably had the worst effect on 
Matt because he was wearing metal-rimmed glasses," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Metal-rimmed glasses were a factor in the earlier lightning strike, too, his 
mother recalled. 
</P>
<P>
More than a decade ago, he and his younger brother and two other boys were in a 
rowboat on a lake in Arizona's White Mountains when lightning struck during a 
sudden storm. "Matt was temporarily stunned," his mother said, "but one of the 
other boys was pretty badly hurt. . . . That boy was wearing metal-rimmed 
glasses, too." 
</P>
<P>
Relatives and friends alike mourned the death of Nordbrock. 
</P>
<P>
A senior credit analyst who had just won a promotion at the Earle M. Jorgensen 
Co. in Lynwood, Nordbrock was remembered as a powerful athlete, a health 
enthusiast and a gregarious man who attracted friends like a magnet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm bummed out," said a shaken Joseph Cotti, 22, another roommate who would 
have been on the fateful trip if he hadn't had to work Saturday. "This kind of 
thing is something you can't really plan for. They were just a bunch of guys 
who went up there to have a good time and enjoy the wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
Cotti's girlfriend, Alice Brancali, 22, her blue eyes brimming with tears, 
added: "We keep hoping it's a nightmare and we're going to wake up and Matt 
will be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Cotti said he was drawn into the University of Arizona graduate's orbit by a 
newspaper ad for a room to rent two years ago. They, in turn, hooked up with 
Swift, another University of Arizona alumnus. In short order, their circles of 
friends converged. Besides sharing fishing trips, cycling excursions and other 
athletic activities, on Sundays they often attended church together and 
followed up with a barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
The roommates were big fans of country-pop artist Jimmy Buffett, and friends 
from all over converged in Orange County for the singer's show last month. 
</P>
<P>
Cotti said he last saw Nordbrock and the 24-year-old Swift as they piled into a 
Honda Accord hatchback Friday evening with buddies Kent Kroener and Steven 
Hellman, both engineers living in Huntington Beach and experienced hikers. 
</P>
<P>
"They were fighting over who got what seat," Cotti recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with Jimmy Buffett tapes, the foursome headed for the High Sierra about 7 
p.m. According to Swift, who telephoned Cotti early Sunday morning with the 
news of Nordbrock's death, the group broke camp at about 10 or 11 a.m. Saturday 
and headed for the 14,494-foot peak. 
</P>
<P>
It was nearly 5:30 p.m., Swift told Cotti and Evelyn Nordbrock, when they 
reached the top and the storm blew in. Kroener and Hellman, both 23, went to 
find shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"They were at the very top (of Mt. Whitney), and they felt quivers or burning 
from the rocks near them, and Matt said, 'Hey, we've got to get out of here,' " 
Evelyn Nordbrock said Swift told her. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently confident that the odds were in his favor, Nordbrock reportedly told 
Swift, "I've been hit by lightning before, so I won't get struck." 
</P>
<P>
The pair then ran downhill and were waved into the stone cabin by Kroener and 
Hellman. 
</P>
<P>
Swift, who was released from the hospital with first- and second-degree burns, 
was driving to Huntington Beach with Kroener and Hellman late Sunday and could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Nordbrock is survived by his parents, Evelyn and Neil, brothers Mark, 28, and 
Daniel, 22, and by a half sister, Kim Beller, 34, of Greenwood, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Nordbrock said she and her husband were trying, through the American 
Consulate in Madrid, to get word of the tragedy to their eldest son, a law 
student who is spending the summer in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral will be held in Tucson, but arrangements had not been set late 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Huntington Beach, tearful acquaintances sorted through mementos 
of their lost friend and made plans to fly to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt's gone, but there are all these people who care about him. He was just 
very, very loved by everybody," Brancali said.

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER LAND SWAP TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A land swap that would provide residents a community center and playing fields 
and speed completion of Alton Parkway will be up for initial approval by the 
Board of Supervisors at its regular meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The swap proposed by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who is seeking the board's 
"conceptual approval," involves the Foothill Ranch Co., which will be allowed 
to build a commercial development on a 73-acre parcel off El Toro Road that is 
now owned by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez called the plan a "truly unique opportunity" because it would allow 
construction of the recreational facilities and completion of Alton Parkway, a 
major roadway that can divert traffic away from neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez has proposed exchanging the county's 73-acre site for Foothill Ranch 
Co.'s help in building the El Toro/Lake Forest Community Center and playing 
fields. The proposal also calls for joint parking facilities for recreation 
areas and nearby Saddleback Community Church, and for the company to construct 
a low-rise business park. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the swap would require the company to acquire a portion of land 
needed by the Marine Corps at El Toro for future base housing. The county wants 
to complete Alton Parkway, which cuts through Marine Corps property. Instead of 
buying the right-of-way, the county has reached an agreement with the Marine 
Corps to have Foothill Ranch Co. acquire land for base housing, and in return 
the county will be awarded right-of-way for the completion of Alton Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial development of the 73-acre site would be restricted to preserve the 
Aliso Creek corridor in its entirety. It is estimated that only about 30 to 40 
acres of the site would be developed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county parcel is an open-space area, Vasquez said he has been 
advised by the county Environmental Management Agency that the area's natural 
open-space value is "extremely limited" because of the planned extension of 
Portola Parkway and other access roads. DAVID REYES

CURTIS RECALL FIGHT MAY AFFECT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the filing period for November's city election opens today, voters should 
get their first sign of whether an attempt to recall Councilman Robert A. 
Curtis four months ago will be an issue in the upcoming race. 
</P>
<P>
After a bitter fight that deeply divided the 2-year-old city, several 
candidates are expected to oppose two council members who supported Curtis' 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, many voters in the recall election felt that they were either 
voting for Curtis or for the Mission Viejo Co., which spent about $350,000 to 
unseat Curtis because of his slow-growth stance. 
</P>
<P>
And just minutes after Curtis retained his seat by a wide margin, his 
supporters were vowing to work against the reelection in November of three 
incumbent council members who came out against Curtis in the final days of the 
recall campaign. One of them, Mayor Christian W. Keena, subsequently decided 
not to run for reelection, citing a need to concentrate on his law practice. 
</P>
<P>
The other two are Councilman Norman P. Murray and Councilwoman Victoria C. 
Jaffe. Murray has declared his candidacy and Jaffee is expected to run. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the recall attempt) will have tremendous impact on the election," 
said Ray Carolin, who announced his candidacy within days after the recall 
attempt failed. "The Curtis recall election served as a catalyst for a number 
of groups that independently didn't like the ways things are done here in 
Mission Viejo." 
</P>
<P>
But Murray said the Curtis recall effort should not affect November's election. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, it's past history," he said. "I've made my amends 
with Bob Curtis, and I feel that we are conducting city business on a friendly 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
In May, Curtis surprised the community by announcing that he had negotiated an 
agreement with the giant development firm that would give the city seven acres 
of land to build a civic center. In exchange, the city approved company plans 
for a large commercial complex. However, the deal has not won the support of 
the rest of the council. FRANK MESSINA

STUDY WILL PINPOINT ACCIDENT AREAS

City officials will pay $24,000 for a computer study that will track traffic 
accidents in the city and pinpoint problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
Police and public works officials say the program will help them develop 
strategy to reduce the 1,200 accidents reported in Mission Viejo last year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to accumulating statistics, the program "tells you how the 
accidents are happening," said Lt. George Johnson of the Sheriff's Department. 
"For instance, it tells you things like whether the sun is interfering with 
seeing the signal and shows whether the (light) cycle is too long or short." 
</P>
<P>
Along with approving the funds, the city also picked Kimley-Horn and Associates 
Inc. as consultant for the project, known as the Accident Identification and 
Surveillance Program. The firm has indicated that the program will be on-line 
in approximately two months. 
</P>
<P>
The program will also recommend ways that the city Public Works Department can 
improve sites with high accident rates. The consultant will also develop a 
priority list for needed street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited by this program," said Johnson, who is in charge of the 
sheriff's deputies assigned to Mission Viejo. "I think it's going to be very 
helpful. The information we get will identify those areas where I need to 
concentrate enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Norman P. Murray said the project is part of an effort by Mission 
Viejo to update its computer system. Last month, the City Council approved a 
$200,000 for new personal computers, computer programs and a central data 
storage unit. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an expensive program, and if it saves one life or prevents two or 
three injuries this year, it's worth it," Murray said. "It's another tool for 
us to use, and I think this program can be very effective." FRANK MESSINA

Construction workers are busy this week grading a site on East Brown Street for 
yet another school, a now familiar sight in a city where new schools are being 
built at a rate of about two per year. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana Unified School District, already the largest in Orange County 
with 43 schools and nearly 43,000 students, is in the midst of a $225-million 
school construction program. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s were a decade of tremendous growth for the district, where about 
1,000 new students have arrived each year since 1985. And that growth shows no 
sign of leveling off during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
District officials estimate that the student population could reach 50,000 
within the next few years, a phenomenon they attribute to the number of 
high-density apartment complexes built during the 1980s in neighborhoods once 
dominated by single-family homes, said Mike Vail, senior director of 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We need these new schools as soon as we can build them," Vail said. 
</P>
<P>
To pay for the new projects, the district has had to rely heavily on state 
money earmarked specifically for building new schools. Approximately $50 
million of the fund was used to build the district's fourth high school, 
Century, as well as Sepulveda and John F. Kennedy elementary schools, all 
opened during the 1989-90 school year. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to open by September, 1991, is James Garfield Elementary School. In 
the meantime, a makeshift campus of portable classrooms has been constructed on 
the playing fields of the Garfield school site and will be used until the 
school is built. 
</P>
<P>
State funding has also been approved for George Washington Carver and Martin R. 
Heninger elementary schools, with construction beginning this fall. Carver is 
scheduled to open in 1991 and Heninger in early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The district received state funds to buy the land for Adeline C. Walker and 
Martin Luther King elementary schools but has not yet received money to begin 
construction. Two more elementary schools are in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
"The pivotal question is funding," Vail said. "If something happens to State 
School Building Program funds, that will put a major hitch in our plans." 
</P>
<P>
The district has had to be aggressive in obtaining land for the new schools, 
"but we are also trying to minimize the impact on people whose property we are 
acquiring," Vail said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to buying a school from the Tustin Unified School District, Santa 
Ana has bought commercial, residential and church properties. All landowners 
have settled on a selling price with the district without negotiations going to 
trial, Vail said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we have to go on sites that have already been developed presents 
a tremendous challenge," Vail said. "No one could have predicted that the city 
would change the zoning from residential homes to apartments in so many areas. 
No one in the school district could have projected this happening, so the land 
was not set aside." GREG HERNANDEZ SANTA ANA SCHOOL ENROLLMENT Santa Ana 
Unified School District's student population has grown by more than 1,000 
students each year since 1985 causing the district to plan for 15 new schools 
-- three which opened this year. The following chart reveals the district's 
enrollment increases during the past five years, current enrollment, and 
projected enrollment increases for the next five years.

BOND ISSUE IS BOON TO SENIOR HOUSING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A bond issue that will result in 20% of the units in a major senior-citizens 
housing project being rented at reduced rates has been approved by the Garden 
Grove Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, acting as the Housing Authority, last week approved a 
$12-million bond issue to benefit the 178-unit Valley View Senior Villas 
currently being constructed on the east side of Valley View Street south of 
Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Devereaux, the city's housing director, said that under governmental 
guidelines 20% of the units (about 35) will be rented at reduced rates to 
people earning 50% or less of the county median income. 
</P>
<P>
Those units would cost $492 a month for one-bedroom apartments and $554 a month 
for two-bedroom apartments. The balance of the units are expected to rent at a 
monthly market rate of $635 for one-bedroom units and $875 for two-bedroom 
units. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue allows the city Housing Authority to serve as a "pass-through" 
financing vehicle, with the actual loan made by Wells Fargo Bank. The bond 
issue also allows the developer to get a lower mortgage rate, according to 
Devereaux, a rate he estimates at about 8.25%, two points lower than the market 
rate. JIM TORTOLANO

COUNTY'S PIERS ARE NO MATCH FOR THE ELEMENTS

<P>
The past decade has not been kind to Orange County's piers. 
</P>
<P>
The now-abandoned Huntington Beach Pier stands as a testament to the 
destructiveness of several storms in the 1980s that mercilessly battered those 
sturdy platforms of wood, cement and steel that stretch into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
During a pounding by 30-foot waves two years ago, a 250-foot portion of the 
concrete pier was torn off and the rest so badly weakened that it was closed. 
The pier will finally be dismantled in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 storm also inflicted damage on the Newport Beach, Balboa and San 
Clemente piers, but not enough to close them. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, storm damage forced the temporary closure of the Seal Beach and 
Huntington Beach piers for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
And three years earlier, a fierce storm caused major damage to the Huntington 
Beach, San Clemente and Seal Beach piers, tearing off portions of the platforms 
and uprooting the deep pilings. All three were closed months for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach plans to build a new pier that should be open to the public in 
1992. "If we do it right, it should last us 100 years," Deputy City 
Administrator Jim Palin said. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, none of the county's piers have lasted anywhere near 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Each pier has undergone extensive repairs and piling and platform replacements 
over the years. In fact, city officials say that there are no original 
materials left on any of the piers except Aliso Pier, which was built in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
And even Aliso Pier was closed all of last year for renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"Piers are much like the human body, where all the cells die and are replaced 
within seven years," San Clemente Marine Safety Capt. Lynn Hughes said.

MIKE DOWNEY: SHE SUCCEEDS AS A PERSON, AS AN ATHLETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An aptly named woman who once played tennis for a living, and played it quite 
well -- Margaret Court -- opened her big mouth this week to declare that 
Martina Navratilova, the greatest tennis player of any woman who ever lived, is 
not her idea of a role model because Navratilova does not conform to her 
homophobic idea of what makes a woman a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Court hereby captures this year's Anita Bryant trophy, designating her 
1990's most depressing person. This woman's vision is fuzzier than any tennis 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
Let us put aside for a moment that it is none of Margaret Court's business with 
whom Martina Navratilova co-habitates or socializes, any more than it is 
whether she should play left- or right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
I am willing to wager that if a woman of Navratilova's considerable wisdom and 
wit ever cared to, she could get off any number of very funny one-liners with 
regard to the type of masculine person who would choose to keep Court company. 
</P>
<P>
But Navratilova isn't like that. Navratilova doesn't take cheap shots. 
Navratilova has dignity, and integrity, and class, and self-esteem, and enough 
common sense to ignore the sort of insidious babble that comes out of the 
mouths of individuals such as this. 
</P>
<P>
Martina hits winners, not losers. 
</P>
<P>
She is more than just the greatest female athlete of this generation. She is 
one of the great American athletes of anybody's generation. 
</P>
<P>
When Navratilova, at 33, won the Wimbledon championship for the ninth time, it 
should have been celebrated as an achievement by an American athlete every bit 
as great, if not greater, than Jack Nicklaus' winning another Masters golf 
championship at age 46, or Nolan Ryan pitching another no-hitter at 43. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't, though. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it wasn't because women athletes continue to have difficulty in America 
commanding as much respect and awe as men, which is sad beyond belief, because 
Navratilova is 100 times the athlete Nicklaus is. Nicklaus is clearly skillful, 
but Navratilova is a physical marvel. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe Martina still fails to gain fame as a great American athlete because 
everybody keeps forgetting that she is an American. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does she have the papers to prove it, Navratilova seems to me to be 
even more of a true American than most of us because she chose to become one. 
She wasn't born here, by accident. She wanted to be here. She risked alienation 
and scorn, abandoned relatives and friends, adopted new customs and language, 
strictly because she desired to become an American -- which is, if you think 
about it, exactly what America, for more than 200 years, has been all about. 
</P>
<P>
And from there, let's consider this "role model" business that has Margaret 
Court so hot and bothered. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot think of a dozen athletes from coast to coast, from continent to 
continent, who comport themselves as better so-called role models than Martina 
Navratilova. She is unfailingly courteous, generous, eloquent, accessible, 
candid, stylish and dignified. If, over the past 15 or 20 years, Martina 
Navratilova has misbehaved in public, I'm sorry, but, like one of her passing 
shots, it got right by me. 
</P>
<P>
You never hear her use profanity toward an umpire, even though in Czech, 
English and no doubt a few other languages, she knows all the words. You never 
see her petulantly splintering her racket against a net post, never catch her 
pulling some of the stunts that have made so many professional tennis players 
seem to behave as though the need for "concentration" entitles them to tell the 
entire world to shut up. 
</P>
<P>
Without being boring about it, Navratilova is relentlessly complimentary and 
gracious toward opponents, before, during and after matches. This cannot be 
easy for someone so competitive, either. 
</P>
<P>
I still smile thinking of the time Chris Evert was the host of NBC's "Saturday 
Night Live" and did a sketch in which whatever profession she chose upon 
retirement -- including real estate and vegetable growing -- she found 
Navratilova right beside her, trying to sell more houses or grow larger 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Martina Navratilova has made mistakes. Now there's a real shocker -- a 
human being who made mistakes. Once some airport police found a handgun in her 
suitcase. Someone else had packed her bag, Martina said. Another time she 
explained a U.S. Open defeat by saying she was sick from eating from a bowl 
that had she had neglected to keep away from her pet cats. Yeah, I hate it when 
that happens. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, however, Martina Navratilova has done nothing but enhance the 
field of athletics and the stature of those individuals who grace it. 
</P>
<P>
And don't think that I don't know the real question: Would I want my daughter 
to grow up to be like Martina Navratilova? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is: What I want my daughter to grow up to be is whatever it is she 
grows up to be.

TOUR DE FRANCE; 
</P>
<P>
TOP CONTENDERS CONTINUE THEIR GAINS ON CHIAPPUCCI

MILLAU, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second week of the Tour de France ended Sunday with the three major 
contenders -- Greg LeMond, Eric Breukink and Pedro Delgado -- making minor 
gains on overall leader Claudio Chiappucci of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Chiappucci lost 13 seconds in the 127.5-mile 14th stage from Le Puy-en-Valay to 
Millau after losing more than five minutes in Saturday's stage. He is 1 minute 
49 seconds ahead of Breukink, 2:21 ahead of LeMond and 4:26 ahead of Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's stage through gorges and rugged mountains in the Massif Central region 
of south central France was not expected to produce many changes. Neither is 
today's relatively flat 105.5-mile stage from Millau to Revel. 
</P>
<P>
"Monday (today) will be more calm before the stage to Luz Ardiden," LeMond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Luz Ardiden is the Tour's second most difficult stage, with three major climbs 
over the last 36 miles in the Pyrenees. In the last two years, Spain's Delgado 
has dominated this segment of the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's stage could be decisive. After two weeks of intense riding, the 
cyclists will be exhausted going into the arduous climbs of the Pyrenees. In 
such a close race, the championship probably will be won by the rider who 
survives the physical ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I am counting on Luz Ardiden making the difference," LeMond said. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors will complete consecutive stages in the Pyrenees starting Tuesday 
with the stage from Blagnac, outside Toulouse, to Luz Ardiden. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, LeMond was content to place fifth as he kept watch on Breukink of the 
Netherlands and Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was very, very nervous," said LeMond, in third place overall. "We 
all waited for the final hill." 
</P>
<P>
Marino Lejarreta of Spain won the stage by breaking away on a final ascent up 
the Causse Noir, a steep climb of about three miles. 
</P>
<P>
As temperatures reached 91 degrees, various riders tried attacks and breakaways 
that failed throughout the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The group of riders came together at the final hill outside of Millau. LeMond, 
Delgado, Breukink and Chiappucci headed the top group. But Lejarreta broke away 
about two miles from the finish and won by 24 seconds over Spain's Miguel 
Indurain. Italy's Gianni Bugno, winner of the Giro d'Italia in June, was third, 
a second behind Indurain. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last climb we watched each other," LeMond said. "Breukink fell behind, 
but he was back very quickly. I think that Delgado and Breukink are the ones to 
watch. Chiappucci is not a major contender." 
</P>
<P>
Other than time differentials, there were no changes in the standings among the 
leaders. Delgado stayed fifth but moved within 4:26 of the lead, two seconds 
behind fourth-place Ronan Pensec of France.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Formerly known as the Rooster, Angel Manager Doug Rader is now the Juggler. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Inconsistency, a logjam in the outfield and injuries in the infield add up to 
88 different Angel lineups in 89 games -- the most remarkable statistic of an 
unremarkable season in Anaheim. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Only the lineup cards of April 11 and 14 have been the same: Devon White, cf; 
Johnny Ray, 2b; Wally Joyner, 1b; Chili Davis, dh; Dante Bichette, lf; Claudell 
Washington, rf; Lance Parrish, c; Jack Howell, 3b; Mark McLemore, ss. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That lineup is 2-0 -- Mark Langston and Mike Witt combined for a 1-0 no-hitter 
over Seattle and Bichette's three-run homer beat Minnesota, 7-5, in 12 innings 
three nights later -- but won't be repeated because Washington was traded to 
the Yankees and McLemore is disabled. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the Angels are not in contention for the American League West title. 
And, barring a dramatic upturn, this will be the first time since 1975 that 
neither the Angels nor the Dodgers will have been a factor in a divisional 
race. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Worst call of the weekend was made Saturday by Wrigley Field official scorer 
Bob Rosenberg when he gave Andre Dawson a single after hitting a routine 
grounder to Dodger shortstop Alfredo Griffin, who couldn't get the ball out of 
his glove until it was too late. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg had the biggest smile in all of Chicago when Mike Morgan allowed his 
first legitimate hit in the seventh inning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Amused was Loel Schrader, the recently retired sports columnist of the Long 
Beach Press Telegram. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, Clair (Toby) Tobias of the Grand Fork Chiefs of the Class C Northern 
League was seeking his second consecutive no-hitter. In the first inning, a 
Duluth batter bunted the ball to the third baseman, who threw wildly over the 
first baseman's head. Official scorer Schrader ruled it a hit. By the fifth 
inning, Tobias hadn't allowed another hit. Schrader then went down and asked 
the first-base umpire if a good throw would have gotten that bunter in the 
first inning. He said yes. Schrader changed his call to an error -- and Toby 
Tobias eventually got his second consecutive no-hitter, believed to be a first 
in the minor leagues. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Rob Dibble and Andrew Dice Clay. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Think the Dodgers may have made a mistake when they re-signed Mike Marshall and 
not Steve Sax?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Although they are 0-1 in their 1917 style uniforms, the Chicago White Sox 
should wear them again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I hope Sox Manager Jeff Torborg isn't going to wear out relief ace Bobby 
Thigpen, who made his third consecutive appearance and 42nd of the season 
Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Few people enjoy their jobs more than Oakland Athletics outfielder Dave 
Henderson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Joyce, wife of CBS "Morning Show" co-host Harry Smith, did a good job 
hosting the network's pregame baseball show Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the foul pole is in fair territory, why isn't it called the fair pole?. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best conditioned athletes in the world are competing in the Tour de 
France, where the other day they bicycled up mountains in 107-degree heat and 
90% humidity. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dunleavy made his first decision as Lakers coach a good one by retaining 
assistant coaches Bill Bertka, Randy Pfund and Jim Eyen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Jacques Demers and Jim Devellano of Detroit were the hottest 
coach-general manager pair in the NHL. Now Demers is out of a job and Devellano 
has been kicked upstairs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Could there be a place in the Kings' organization for Demers?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Valvano: My Side," by Jim Valvano will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster's 
Pocket Book in February. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Inside Sports magazine underrated the maize and blue uniforms of Michigan when 
it rated them second best looking in college football behind Florida State's 
garnet and gold . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tallest female gymnast in the U.S. Olympic Festival was 5-3. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, HBO, but I'm still not convinced that Mike Tyson is "baaack" like you 
say in your commercials just because he knocked out Henry Tillman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One winning Pick Six ticket has been sold on 15 of the first 61 days of the 
Hollywood Park meeting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fenway Park gets less sacred every time I see beach balls being thrown around. 
. . . That celebrity golf tournament on NBC was OK, but I'd much rather watch 
Michael Jordan stuff a basketball than sink a putt. . . . You know what kind of 
a season it is for the Chicago Cubs when Harry Caray says, "It's only a game."

Mike Marshall of the New York Mets spent Saturday night at a Cincinnati 
hospital and underwent tests for a condition diagnosed as inflammation of the 
gastrointestinal tract. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, 30, who has played in 53 games for the Mets this season, is being 
placed on the disabled list for 15 days, Met Manager Bud Harrelson said. 
</P>
<P>
He was released Sunday from the hospital, Harrelson said. Marshall was 
hospitalized Saturday, one day after he and Harrelson had a loud clubhouse 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall has been unhappy in a part-time role since being acquired from the 
Dodgers in the off-season and said he wants to be traded.

Quarterback Mark Herrmann, whose Ram future has been in doubt since the 
acquisition of Chuck Long from the Detroit Lions, remains unsigned as 
quarterback Jim Everett and selected running backs report to camp today. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann, 31, was supposed to report, too, but no deal had been completed as of 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ram sources said that in Herrmann's case, a contract could be worked out before 
today's practice. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann's chances of making this year's team appear to depend on whether the 
Rams keep three quarterbacks on their roster. 
</P>
<P>
In other news, Mike McDonald, the team's snapper on punts and field goals, has 
been signed to a one-year contract, leaving the Rams with seven unsigned 
veterans, including Pro Bowl linebacker Kevin Greene. CHRIS DUFRESNE

WILLIAMS DOMINATES DIVING, WINS 10-METER CHAMPIONSHIP

<P>
Wendy Lian Williams' last visit to the U.S. Olympic Festival was not pleasant. 
This one should help erase the memories. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, the bronze medalist at the 1988 Olympics, dominated the competition 
Sunday on the last day of the Festival in winning the 10-meter platform 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
In her only other festival appearance, in 1985, she had finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disastrous," said Williams of Laguna Beach. "That was so long ago. I 
feel like a different person now. In those days I felt so young and naive and 
scared up there." 
</P>
<P>
Although she didn't do as well on her final dive as she had wanted, the 
23-year-old piled up 443.16 points to beat Mary Ellen Clark of Newton Square, 
Pa., by nearly 50 points.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

WHITE SOX SWEEP YANKEES WITH 11TH CONSECUTIVE ROAD VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago White Sox have stayed in the race with the world champion Oakland 
Athletics in the American League West largely because they have made themselves 
at home on the road. 
</P>
<P>
This is especially true of their weekend visit to New York. They hated to leave 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy Sosa's two-run bloop single highlighted a five-run sixth inning Sunday as 
the White Sox beat the Yankees, 8-5, to sweep the four-game series. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox, with the best road record in baseball (25-10) have now won 11 
consecutive road games and remain just a game behind the Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox finished the season with a 10-2 record against the worst team in 
the league, one of the wins was when Yankee Andy Hawkins no-hit them. The last 
time the Sox swept four in New York was 26 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It never seems to be easy, though," Manager Jeff Torborg said. "We just do a 
fine job of coming from behind. We better be able to win on the road, because 
we still have 46 games left away from home." 
</P>
<P>
A key to the White Sox success is bullpen ace Bobby Thigpen. He has saves in 
the last three games and has 30 in 42 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"I think getting in three or four times a week is really helping me," said the 
right-hander who will be 27 Tuesday and celebrated by pitching a perfect inning 
in the All-Star game. "Last year, we didn't win as much and I didn't see as 
much action. I tend to get too strong. Then, I overthrow." 
</P>
<P>
In the three games, Thigpen faced just 10 batters, struck out two of them and 
gave up a single. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 4, Milwaukee 1 -- Right fielder Felix Jose often feels overwhelmed in 
the company of Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire and other members of the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there are occasions, such as this one at Oakland, that Jose is the 
standout. 
</P>
<P>
In the top of the first, Jose's leaping catch robbed Robin Yount of a three-run 
home run. In the home half, he came up with the bases loaded and hit his sixth 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
"You talk about a sensational inning," Manager Tom Trebelhorn of the Brewers 
said. "The home run was even bigger than the catch. How often can a player 
account for a seven-run swing?" 
</P>
<P>
To top off his performance, Jose threw out Dave Parker at the plate trying to 
score from second on a single in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
He actually caught Yount's drive twice. His glove was six inches above the 
fence when it hit in the pocket and popped out as he hit the fence. He reached 
out with his barehand and grabbed the ball before falling to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never hit a grand slam," Jose said. "For that matter, I can't remember 
making a catch like that, either. The throw was pretty good, too." 
</P>
<P>
Jose enabled Curt Young (5-3) to run his lifetime record against Milwaukee to 
6-0. He gave up seven hits and a run in eight innings in his fourth consecutive 
strong outing. 
</P>
<P>
The A's put third baseman Carney Lansford, who has a strained right hamstring, 
on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to July 12 and recalled outfielder Doug 
Jennings and infielder Lance Blankenship from triple-A Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
To make room on the roster, the A's released right-hander Mike Norris, 35, who 
was attempting a comeback after a six-year absence from the major leagues. 
Norris was 1-0 with a 3.00 earned-run average in of 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Norris began his career with Oakland in 1975. His best season was in 1980, when 
he went 22-9 with a 2.54 ERA. Drug problems forced him out of baseball 
throughout most of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 7, Cleveland 0 -- Bill Swift, in his first start of the season, pitched 
a brilliant eight innings at Seattle to end the Indians' three-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Swift (3-2) gave up just three hits. With Ken Griffey Jr. and Tracy Jones 
hitting home runs, it was an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 13, Boston 4 -- The Royals teed off on the Red Sox pitching staff 
at Boston. But, because the Angels beat Toronto, the Red Sox didn't fall out of 
first in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Perry, who set a club record with seven hits in Saturday's doubleheader, 
had two more hits and three stolen bases. Kurt Stillwell, George Brett, Pat 
Tabler and Sam Pecota each drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
In winning three out of four, the Royals outscored the Red Sox, 27-16, and 
outhit them, 57-39. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 3, Texas 2 -- Mike Heath hit a two-run home run at Detroit and the 
Tigers presented Sparky Anderson with his 1,800th win as a manager. Only nine 
other managers have won more. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 10, Baltimore 3 -- Kirby Puckett hit two home runs and drove in five 
runs at Baltimore and made it easy for Allan Anderson to win for the first time 
in three months. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson (3-12), who won 17 games last season, had failed to win in 12 starts 
since May 14. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson gave up six hits in seven innings before giving way to Jack Savage. 
The Twins provided Anderson with eight runs in the first three innings. DAN

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ONCE AGAIN, THE PIRATES AREN'T MUCH OF A PROBLEM FOR WHITSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
So far this season, the New York Mets or the Montreal Expos haven't been able 
to take over the lead in the East from the surprising Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
And, for most of the teams in the West, the Pirates might as well be in a 
higher league. 
</P>
<P>
However, former Pirate Ed Whitson doesn't have any problems when he pitches 
against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson extended his mastery over the Pirates to seven years Sunday at 
Pittsburgh when he pitched the struggling San Diego Padres to a 4-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson (7-6) held the heavy-hitting Pirates to four hits in seven innings to 
give new Manager Greg Riddoch his first victory after three defeats. 
</P>
<P>
The third win in the last 16 games for the Padres ended a four-game losing 
streak. The Pirates, who had won 10 out of 12, lead the East by two games. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Pirates beat the veteran right-hander was July 26, 1983. In 
his last 10 starts against them he is 8-0. He is 5-0 in the last two seasons 
with a 1.12 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, who broke in with the Pirates in 1977, also played with San Francisco 
and spent two seasons with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my wife that I won Lou Piniella's first game as a manager, and if I got 
a couple of runs I'd win Greg Riddoch's first game," Whitson said. "I really 
wanted to give him his first one. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked pitching in this ballpark. The mound's real good here and 
I'm real comfortable here. 
</P>
<P>
"I had good stuff and good control. Against these guys, if you get behind them 
and have to go with the fastball, you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
The loser was Neal Heaton (10-5). Until he reversed the trend last season, 
Heaton had always pitched well early in the season and then was ineffective in 
the second half. He has lost three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wasn't throwing well, I'd be concerned," Manager Jim Leyland said. "He's 
still keeping us in the game -- three runs." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 2, New York 1 -- Manager Lou Piniella may have finally found the 
right spot for Norm Charlton -- as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
Charlton, in his first start in two years, held the Mets scoreless on two hits 
for six innings at Cincinnati to improve to 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis hit two doubles to drive in both runs. Mariano Duncan was on base 
each time. Duncan, who had three hits in four at-bats, was eight for 16 and 
scored five runs in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Charlton, a hard-throwing left-hander, didn't seem to fit in on a club with 
closers such as Randy Myers and Rob Dibble. But he was too good to use as a 
middle reliever. The hope was that he could start. 
</P>
<P>
Dibble, who came in for Charlton, pitched 1 2/3 innings but had to be replaced 
by Myers in the eighth after the Mets scored. Myers struck out Howard Johnson 
to end the inning. He struck out the side in the ninth, including pinch-hitter 
Darryl Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 16, Atlanta 14 -- It was an old fashioned slugfest at Atlanta, where 
the Expos and Braves combined for 34 hits, including seven home runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves had more hits (20) and home runs (five), but they also had more 
errors (five), including two in the ninth that helped beat them. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Galarraga, who hit a three-run homer in the sixth, singled home the 
tie-breaking run in a three-run ninth. The win moved the Expos to within 3 1/2 
games of the lead in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wallach hit a grand slam for the Expos and rookie catcher Jimmy Kremers hit 
his first major league homer for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 6, Philadelphia 1 -- Veteran right-hander Danny Darwin gave up a run 
and eight hits in seven innings to improve his record against the Phillies at 
the Astrodome to 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros broke the game open with four runs in the seventh. The key hit was a 
run-scoring double by Javier Ortiz to break a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 5, St. Louis 3 -- Jeff Brantley didn't do the job in the All-Star 
game, but he came through in the clutch at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley came in with the bases loaded and one out in the eighth and retired 
Tim Jones and pinch-hitter Denny Walling. 
</P>
<P>
The three men in the middle of the Gianst' lineup, Will Clark, Kevin Mitchell 
and Matt Williams, scored five runs. Mitchell hit his 24th home run of the 
season. 
</P>

NEWSWIRE: NBC HIRES FRATELLO AS NBA ANALYST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Fratello, who quit as the Atlanta Hawks' coach last April 23, will take 
the NBA analyst's job with NBC Sports that Detroit Piston Coach Chuck Daly 
turned down in favor of trying to win a third straight NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
NBC said Fratello had signed a multiyear contract at an undisclosed sum to join 
Marv Albert and Bob Costas on the NBA broadcast team. Former Laker coach Pat 
Riley is NBC's studio host. 
</P>
<P>
Fratello spent seven seasons as Hawk coach but quit after a 41-41 season in 
which Atlanta failed to make the playoffs for the first time in five years. He 
had a 323-251 record as Atlanta's head coach.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
WITH BAYAKOA SCRATCHED, IT'S GORGEOUS AFTERNOON IN VANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trainer Neil Drysdale said he could understand why Bayakoa's handlers decided 
to scratch the 6-year-old mare from Sunday's $200,000 Vanity Handicap at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode Gorgeous for Drysdale in the Vanity, didn't quite 
agree with his trainer, but he was happy just the same that Bayakoa wasn't 
running. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad she (Bayakoa) wasn't in," Delahoussaye said. "I won the race. If 
these two missed each other some more, it would be easy on both of them." 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous, brought along the inside by Delahoussaye at the top of the stretch, 
won the Vanity by five lengths, beating four fillies and mares with far less 
ability than Bayakoa, who had defeated Gorgeous in last year's Breeders' Cup 
Distaff to clinch the national divisional championship. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Frank Whitham and trainer Ron McAnally didn't run Bayakoa because she was 
assigned 128 pounds by Hollywood racing secretary Eual Wyatt, who gave 124 
pounds to Gorgeous. McAnally thought the four-pound difference was unfair, 
since that was the same spread between the two rivals in their last meeting, 
which resulted in a 2 3/4-length victory for Gorgeous. Since then, Bayakoa 
reeled off two facile victories at Hollywood and Gorgeous ran dismally against 
colts in the Pimlico Special. 
</P>
<P>
It is conjectural whether the suspension of the Gorgeous-Bayakoa rivalry 
affected the crowd. The attendance was 22,821, one of the smallest Sunday 
turnouts of the season, but Hollywood Park's Friday night racing schedule also 
affected the crowd last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorgeous beat us last time, and when horses win, they should pick up weight, 
as Bayakoa has all along," McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
The trainer's plans are to nominate Bayakoa for two stakes at Del Mar -- the 
Palomar Handicap, on the grass, which will be run July 28; and the San Diego 
Handicap, against males, on Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
That means that Bayakoa and Gorgeous probably won't hook up again until the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff at Belmont Park in October, because Gorgeous' schedule is 
expected to take her to Belmont for one or two prep races before the Breeders' 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Wyatt continued to defend his Vanity weight assignments Sunday. "Bayakoa's 
people certainly have the prerogative to do what they did," Wyatt said. "But I 
thought the weights were what they should be, and I've had no second thoughts 
about it. You have to remember that in weighting the top two horses, I also had 
to consider what would be fair for the other horses that were running. I 
haven't lost that many horses over the years because of weight. Precisionist is 
the only other one I can think of." 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous, who is owned by Robert N. Clay of Midway, Ky., ran 1 1/8 miles in 
1:48 1/5, paid $3 to win in a race that had no show betting and earned 
$110,000. The 4-year-old daughter of Slew o' Gold and Kamar, a Key to the Mint 
mare, has won eight of 11 starts, excluding two losses to Bayakoa, and has 
earned $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Fantastic Look finished second, 3 1/2 lengths ahead of Kelly, and it was 
three-quarters of a length farther back to Beautiful Melody, Fantastic Look's 
stablemate. T.V. of Crystal finished last. 
</P>
<P>
The early pace was slow, with Beautiful Melody on the lead and Gorgeous in 
fourth place, about six lengths back. Delahoussaye shifted Gorgeous to the 
fence by the far turn, and there was plenty of room for her to get through past 
the fading Beautiful Melody when she made her winning move leaving the quarter 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux, who rode Fantastic Look, apparently was unhappy that Gary 
Stevens, aboard Beautiful Melody, allowed Gorgeous to get through, but 
Delahoussaye never seemed worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see Gary's filly coming off the fence," Delahoussaye said. "If I get 
through, I'm a hero, but if I get stopped, I'm a bum. The way my filly was 
running, I think that if we got stopped, she would have run right over them." 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye said that there might have been a faster pace had Bayakoa run. 
</P>
<P>
"Four pounds' difference with these two horses shouldn't make much difference," 
Delahoussaye said. "Horses like Forego and Kelso carried 130 pounds or more in 
their day and still beat other horses. I can see if the spread is 10 pounds, 
then one horse might have an advantage over another one. I'm glad that they 
don't weight horses like they used to, though, because it gives them a better 
chance to keep running." 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale broke out of a season-long slump. Before the Vanity, he had won with 
only three of 37 starters and his last win had come on June 1.

<P>
A report in Saturday's editions of the Los Angeles Times that the NCAA is about 
to file charges against national basketball champion Nevada Las Vegas for major 
rules violations is a personal vendetta by a Times reporter, Coach Jerry 
Tarkanian claimed. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV Athletic Director Brad Rothermel, who has announced he will leave his 
position at the end of this year, said the NCAA may have completed a 
preliminary investigation into the school's basketball program, but he said he 
was unaware of any major violations involved. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Danny Robbins reported that NCAA enforcement officials had prepared a 
list of charges and could send it to UNLV in a matter of weeks. Some of the 
allegations are "major," according to an anonymous source quoted by the Times. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's talking about a source who's saying there are major violations, I'd 
like to know who it is. It can't be from somebody within the NCAA because the 
NCAA can't release that information," Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Robbins, he said: "This is the same guy who has been trying to get us 
for quite a while. I don't know what his problem is. He's purposely been out to 
get us." 
</P>
<P>
John Cherwa, associate sports editor for the Times, issued this statement: 
</P>
<P>
"Coaches often say reporters are out to get them when they read something they 
don't like. Obviously, Danny Robbins doesn't have a vendetta against Las Vegas, 
Jerry Tarkanian or anyone else for that matter. He's simply reporting the story 
of a very high profile NCAA investigation. It's a story he's been covering for 
a long time and he will continue to report it for us."

PERRIER, STRIVING TO BOUNCE BACK, TARGETS CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's summertime, and the livin' is easy. At least that's the word from Perrier 
Group of America as the company rolls out Phase II of its campaign to get 
squeamish sippers back in the market for "Earth's First Soft Drink." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there was benzene in it once, but it's gone now. All the 
Indian-club-shaped bottles were pulled from the shelves in February. A 
three-month drought ensued, but in most major markets, that's over too. 
</P>
<P>
All that's left is a $25-million ad campaign and an all-out effort to wrest 
shelf space back from the competition in shops, bars, hotels and restaurants. 
Perrier says it's ahead of schedule, but its enemies in the water wars are 
dubious. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the flurry of news releases faxed across the country in the days after 
Perrier launched its new radio ads in Southern California last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"After only two months of its planned 18-month relaunch program, the Perrier 
Group of America announced Tuesday that it has already regained distribution in 
80% of its retail outlets," Perrier trumpeted. 
</P>
<P>
Unconvinced, La Croix Water Co. of La Cross, Wisc., fired off a rejoinder two 
days later: "Officials of the La Croix Water Company announced today that its 
La Croix Sparkling Water has experienced unprecedented growth since the 
worldwide recall of Perrier water last February." 
</P>
<P>
Perrier returned to the Los Angeles market -- where it spends 15% of its 
advertising budget -- on May 8, after being unveiled earlier on the East Coast. 
Industry experts contend that cracking health-conscious California is crucial 
to the company's success. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles food stores, we're back to almost equivalent distribution to 
where we were before the recall," Lazgin said. "For restaurants, we're at 50% 
of where we were before the recall. We hope to reach 70% by Aug. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Perrier will not disclose precise sales figures, and the numbers it does 
release are a lot murkier than its water. Company officials said sales of the 
regular, unflavored water in May, 1990, were 67% of total Perrier sales in May, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We are gaining ground in regular Perrier," said Perrier spokeswoman Jane 
Lazgin. "Generally, 60% of our sales are regular Perrier and 40% of our sales 
are Perrier With a Twist (flavored). So we're 7% ahead as we re-enter the 
market. We expected to be probably about half that." 
</P>
<P>
The beleaguered firm, however, has yet to start producing its flavored 
products, probably won't begin rolling them out until the end of the summer and 
won't have distribution in place until November or December. 
</P>
<P>
The water's absence -- three months in major markets and much longer in smaller 
cities -- gave its small regional competitors a chance to make a splash in the 
$2.3-billion bottled water business. And while no one company bubbled to the 
top of the market, experts said, several did very well. 
</P>
<P>
"Perrier hasn't recovered completely," said Greg Prince, features editor for 
Beverage World magazine. "The fact that they're selling water at all is pretty 
good. But other brands have had an opening. . . . San Pellegrino, Evian, 
Crystal Geyser come to mind as ones that got a foot in the door." 
</P>
<P>
La Croix, which is sold in 50 states but is not a big player on the West Coast, 
began a media blitz of its own, less than 24 hours after the Perrier recall was 
announced. It established a consumer hot line and published print 
advertisements nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"In roughly a month interval of the recall, our business escalated 300%," said 
William Eiler, spokesman for La Croix. "We have sustained this success. Our 
market share in the Midwest increased 48% from the beginning of February to the 
end of June. We're up 84% in the Chicago area." 
</P>
<P>
Calistoga-based Crystal Geyser saw its sales jump 50% over last year's 
performance, particularly in California, said Peter Gordon, company chairman. 
California is the top state in bottled water consumption, with 36% of all 
sparkling and still waters downed within its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"We really picked up a lot of accounts across the country," Gordon said. "When 
Perrier had to remove all of their products from the market, we were prepared 
to fill the void. What has been very encouraging is that we have held on to the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
If restaurants, hotels and bars show no fidelity to their fumbling former 
favorite, Perrier could be in trouble, said Gary Hemphill, editor of Beverage 
Industry magazine. Distribution is still not back entirely, and that could hurt 
the company as the crucial summer season unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still not where they'd like to be," Hemphill said. "It's still a 
problem for them. It's going to hurt their summer." 
</P>
<P>
But Perrier's Lazgin insists that recovery is more than just possible; it's on 
the way. The distinctive green bottles are back in 50% of the restaurants, bars 
and hotels where they reigned supreme before, including Lutece and 21 in New 
York, Dominique's in Washington, Boston's Grill 23 and Ma Maison and Le 
Chardonnay in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"At retail, we're very pleased with where we are, but we expected to retain 
much of our shelf space," Lazgin said. "In restaurants, which you have to call 
on a one-by-one basis, it takes so much longer. Given those limitations to 
distribution, we think we're doing pretty well."

Big Rock Mesa Landslides: Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. was sued by five 
insurance companies seeking to recover the costs of defending lawsuits filed by 
Malibu homeowners over the Big Rock Mesa landslides. The Los Angeles Superior 
Court suit says Fireman's Fund and the plaintiff-insurers provided insurance to 
some of the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
When the owners were cross-sued by several government entities, the suit says, 
Fireman's Fund named a single law firm to defend them but refused to pay for 
individual lawyers for each homeowner. To avoid potential conflicts, the five 
plaintiffs paid for separate attorneys to defend the homeowners and now want 
Fireman's Fund to reimburse them for the proportionate share of the costs. The 
Big Rock Mesa litigation was settled for more than $100 million last year.

American executives say the United States is losing its second war in Vietnam, 
not to communist guerrillas but to business competitors from Western Europe and 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to revive an economy that is in shambles, Vietnam has opened itself to 
trade and investment from the non-communist world, including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, French, British, Dutch and others are coming in, hoping to profit 
from Vietnam's rich natural resources and the least expensive labor costs in 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
But a tough U.S. trade embargo prevents Americans from entering the market, and 
executives in recent months have become increasingly critical of the ban. Trade 
with Cambodia also is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the anti-embargo push has come from Americans in Asia. But pressure is 
also intensifying in Washington, where business lobbyists are finding allies 
among members of Congress, veterans groups and humanitarian organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become less unfashionable for big American companies to come forward for 
lifting the embargo," said Sesto Vecchi, an American attorney who has made a 
number of trips to Vietnam and represents some U.S. business interests. "The 
ingredients are there for an effective pressure group." 
</P>
<P>
Last April, the Asia-Pacific Council of American Chambers of Commerce called 
for the "immediate removal of restrictions on U.S. trade and investment with 
Vietnam." The umbrella group, which represents 19 chambers, said the embargo 
"severely impacts on American competitiveness in the region." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking recently to a seminar of the American Chamber of Commerce in Thailand, 
Australian businessman Raymond Eaton told non-Americans in the audience: "Do 
your utmost to capitalize on the inability of American companies to compete 
against you -- this is a golden opportunity that is being made available." 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber says about 100 foreign firms have signed joint-venture agreements 
with the Vietnamese valued at $859 million. Oil and gas exploration concessions 
have been given to companies from Great Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, 
Canada, India and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has become Vietnam's second-largest trading partner after the Soviet 
Union. Despite a tough anti-communist political stance, Singapore does a 
low-key business with the Vietnamese worth $200 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting in early, getting in on the ground floor, are really key to long-term 
success," the chairman of Esso Standard Thailand Limited, Roy Weiland, told the 
seminar. He said the Vietnamese were holding some oil concessions for American 
companies but probably wouldn't wait much longer. 
</P>
<P>
Other American executives complained of losing other business as a result of 
the embargo. Some shippers seeking insurance, for example, are switching from 
American companies -- because they could not include Vietnam and Cambodia as 
part of their coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The embargo, imposed on North Vietnam in 1964, was extended to the entire 
country after communist forces seized Saigon 15 years ago.

Japan's Kubota Sued for $25 Million: The suit claims that Kubota Ltd. of Japan 
forced Ardent Computer of Sunnyvale into a merger with Stellar Computer of 
Massachusetts to weaken Ardent and gain its technology. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed by company founders Allen Michels and Matthew Sanders. 
However, the chief executive of Stardent disassociated the supercomputer 
company from the lawsuit, saying it was an individual action by Michels and 
Sanders. Kubota, Ardent's largest shareholder and creditor, said it would 
defend itself vigorously against the charges.

Ethnic Bias Claim: An Iranian industrial engineer sued Entenmann's Inc., 
claiming that he was dismissed from the company's Montebello facility because 
of ethnic discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court case, filed by Mohsen Khosrowshani, alleges 
breach of contract and seeks more than $2 million. Khosrowshani was hired by 
Entenmann's/Orowheat Food Co. in July, 1987. His suit said that, despite praise 
from his immediate supervisor, he was laid off 18 months ago -- after the 
division general manager, among other things, called him "camel head." 
Khosrowshani charges that his layoff was actually a termination "resulting from 
prejudice and discrimination." The case also names parent Kraft General Foods 
and its owner, Philip Morris Cos. (Filed July 12, 1990. Case No. BC005580)

EDUCATIONAL SKILLS DECLINING, JOB RECRUITERS SAY

Sixty-four percent of big U.S. companies are unhappy with the reading, writing 
and reasoning abilities of high school graduates entering the work force, a 
poll of business executives said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Alliance of Business survey found that 72% of executives also 
thought that new employees' math skills had worsened the past five years. 
Sixty-five percent said reading skills had decreased over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Alliance President William Kolberg said the poll results should worry everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on a collision course with the reality that America is developing a 
second-class work force whose best feature in the future, compared with other 
nations, will be low pay," Kolberg said in an interview about the survey 
results. "Low skill means low pay." 
</P>
<P>
Kolberg said new attitudes and approaches are needed to prepare 
non-college-educated Americans for work. 
</P>
<P>
"We have abandoned the millions of kids who don't plan to attend college," he 
said. "Somewhere along the way, we lost respect for the skills we now so 
desperately need in our factories and on the front lines of our service 
industries." 
</P>
<P>
Kolberg said about 82 million U.S. jobs don't require a college degree, and 
filling those jobs may become impossible unless the educational system is 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire school enterprise needs to be restructured, rethought and taken 
much more seriously," he said, pointing to the national education goals 
established by President Bush and the nation's governors. 
</P>
<P>
Kolberg was an assistant secretary of Labor and administrator of the Employment 
and Training Administration from 1973-77. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, described by the alliance as the first to survey executives either 
directly or indirectly responsible for recruitment of workers at the 1,200 
largest U.S. corporations, said only 36% were satisfied with the competence of 
those entering the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Kolberg defined competence as being able to read beyond the seventh-grade level 
and use math at higher than a fifth-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that companies -- many of whose blue-collar and 
secretarial employees face more challenging work than in the past -- have to 
interview seven to eight applicants to find one acceptable employee. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel officers also said many of those who are hired require too much 
training to become effective in their jobs. Forty-eight percent were satisfied 
with the capability of new hires to be trained. Only 16% were satisfied with 
the educational training of new employees, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Most American companies, particularly smaller companies, have not been able to 
adopt new forms of work organization because they can't afford to spend money 
upgrading worker skills," Kolberg said. "Our competitors in Europe and Asia 
have increased productivity by using these new methods of work. Our only 
response to this competitive situation has been to lower wages." 
</P>
<P>
The business alliance predicts that by the year 2000, an estimated 5 million to 
15 million manufacturing jobs will require skills other than those being used 
today and that an equal number of service jobs will be obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly wages of high school graduates dropped from $387.24 in 1969 to 
$335.20 in 1989. The alliance attributes the 12% decline to a loss in 
productivity by so-called front-line workers. It compares that to a wage gain 
of about 8% for a college graduate.

K mart Recalls Reflectors: The big retailer said tests by it and the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration show that several types of 
"mini-self-adhesive reflectors" it sold do not meet federal performance 
requirements for reflectiveness. So the chain is recalling reflectors with 
model Nos. 82-12-91, 92, 98 and 99, and Nos. 82-21-44, 47, 49 and 48. K mart is 
offering a full refund.

ERA OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Dow Jones industrial index can top that magical 3,000 mark this week, 
Wall Street is going to be buzzing with much more talk about a new era of 
investing in the 1990s. At 2,980.20 on Friday, it won't take much to get there. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all the excitement, however, is a nagging concern: Where is the individual 
investor in this "new era"? 
</P>
<P>
Despite the stock market's gains this year, Southern California brokers will 
tell you that they still have a very tough time getting current clients to buy 
individual stocks. And new clients aren't exactly knocking down brokers' doors 
to join the party. It's still a rarity for an individual to call a brokerage, 
unsolicited, and ask to open a stock account. 
</P>
<P>
Even the discount brokerages, which cater specifically to the individual who 
wants to pick his or her own stocks, admit that business hasn't picked up much, 
even as the Dow has staged a dramatic surge from 2,550 in late February. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace at which we're opening accounts is about the same as in 1989," says 
Charles Schwab, head of discount brokerage Charles Schwab &amp; Co., the 
nation's largest. Yet he also admits that "about 25% of the people who might 
have been active in 1987 are dormant now." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, of $27 billion in Schwab customer assets, $9 billion -- fully 33% -- 
is in money market funds and other cash assets, Charles Schwab says. That's a 
record for cash. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't to say individual investors have forsaken the stock market. Far from 
it. What they're buying now are stock mutual funds. Since the start of the 
year, purchases of stock funds have shocked the fund industry. In May alone, 
investors bought $6 billion in stock fund shares, up 58% from May, 1989, 
purchases of $3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers suggest that more individuals have decided that the only way to 
play the market is to opt for the diversification and relative safety of funds. 
There's nothing wrong with that, of course. Indeed, it's the smartest move many 
investors could make. 
</P>
<P>
But some individuals who have the wherewithal to buy individual stocks may be 
missing some great opportunities in the 1990s if they stick only with mutual 
funds. Who wouldn't have liked to have bought Boeing Co., for example, at $39 
early this year, considering that it's $61 now? Or Van Nuys-based security 
services firm Pinkerton Inc., which sold stock at $14 a share in April and is 
at $20 now? 
</P>
<P>
Individuals overall have been reducing their exposure to the stock market for a 
long time. In the market's go-go years of the late 1960s, stocks composed about 
47% of an average household's financial assets (excluding real estate and 
retirement funds). Last year, the stock portion of household financial assets 
was 27.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Should small investors own more stocks -- and, specifically, more individual 
issues? Obviously, that depends on each person's financial resources and 
willingness to take bigger risks for potentially bigger gains. If you can't 
afford to build a portfolio of at least 10 stocks, you probably don't belong in 
the market, unless you've got money to burn. 
</P>
<P>
But if you're mulling the idea of individual stock investing, the market 
environment of the 1990s may well be on your side. Why? This decade is shaping 
up as a stock-picking decade, an era of back-to-basics investing. If you did 
your homework in the 1980s and picked stocks that showed consistent earnings 
growth, your efforts might have been for nothing. In the '80s, many investors 
weren't investors at all but short-term traders looking for the next takeover 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
That's all done now. Today, the stocks that are in demand are those that have 
real stories behind them -- strong franchises, great business prospects and 
strong earnings growth. Those stocks often require patience, because they move 
along as the companies prove themselves year after year. In that kind of 
market, the individual has an advantage over the institutional, big-money 
player, because the individual can afford to be patient. Money managers, in 
contrast, often operate with only one goal in mind: how to survive the quarter 
without being fired. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Hostetler, research chief at Los Angeles brokerage Crowell, Weedon &amp; 
Co., believes that the trends in the market and in society generally favor the 
return of the individual investor in the '90s. "Each decade appears to be 
dominated by a certain class of investor," she notes. "In the 1960s this 
distinction fell to the individual; in the 1970s pension funds and other 
institutions controlled the investment scene; for the past 10 years, 
corporations and arbitragers have been the primary force. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the options have come full circle," Hostetler says, "and that the 
individual will once more be the dominant market force." With the aging of the 
baby boomers, the pool of people putting money away for the long term will rise 
inexorably, Hostetler notes. Those investors will likely look around at real 
estate, bonds, bank CDs and other options, and decide that stocks offer at 
least as much potential, if not more. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not comfortable with individual stocks, stay away from them. But if 
the market intrigues you, this may be the best decade yet to be a part of it. 
</P>

SOME INROADS MADE IN WAR ON POVERTY, WORLD BANK SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: BUT THE PROGRESS ELUDED PARTS OF AFRICA, AND 1.1 BILLION PEOPLE 
STILL LIVE ON LESS THAN $370 A YEAR.

<P>
Most of the world is winning the war against poverty, ignorance and illness, 
and the number of people can be further reduced by the end of the century with 
adequate economic policies, the World Bank says. 
</P>
<P>
It said only one major region -- Sub-Saharan Africa -- risks a degradation of 
its economic and social conditions in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Despite "tremendous" progress the past three decades, 1.1 billion people in 
developing countries -- one out of four -- still live on less than $370 a year, 
World Bank President Barber B. Conable said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's annual report, "World Development 1990 -- Poverty," said per-capita 
consumption in developing countries rose by 67% between 1965 and 1985, life 
expectancy lengthened to 62 years from 51 and primary school enrollment rose to 
84% from 73. 
</P>
<P>
Progress was uneven, with the greatest gains in East Asia. Yet even in 
Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where consumption per capita stagnated 
during the period, life expectancy and primary enrollment rates improved. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the 1980s -- often called a "lost decade for the poor" -- did not 
reverse the overall trend of progress. 
</P>
<P>
"The incomes of most of the world's poor went on rising, and under-5 (years of 
age) mortality, primary school enrollment ratios and other social indicators 
also continued to improve," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
The setbacks of the 1980s occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, 
where poverty increased. In Latin America, however, overall social conditions 
did not deteriorate as much as the fall in income would have suggested, the 
bank noted. 
</P>
<P>
Conable contended that, with adequate economic policies, the number of poor 
could be slashed by 300 million by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no pipe dream," he said, adding that over the past few decades there 
were spectacular victories in the war against poverty in countries as diverse 
as Colombia, Indonesia, Chile and Botswana. 
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, the proportion of poor was reduced to 20% from 60% in the past 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Conable warned, nevertheless, that although the number of poor could be reduced 
by 400 million in Asia, their numbers could swell by 100 million in Sub-Saharan 
Africa because of slow growth in income and high population growth. 
</P>
<P>
He said countries that reduced poverty did so with a two-part strategy. The 
first promoted using the poor's most abundant asset, labor, through policies 
that harness market incentives, social and political institutions, 
infrastructure and technology. The second aimed at providing basic social 
services to the poor -- health care, family planning, nutrition and education. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank voiced optimism on prospects for the global economy for the 
1990s, except for Sub-Saharan Africa. 
</P>
<P>
It projected that industrial economies will achieve a 3% annual growth, 
commodity prices will dip in the short term but gain an average 0.2% per year, 
and real interest rates will fall to between 3% and 4% from almost 5.5% in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The number of poor in Latin America is expected to remain the same as the 
region's economy advances by 4.2% per year through the end of the century, with 
a 2.3% per-capita output gain. If the region achieved better income 
distribution, the number of poor could fall by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
For Sub-Saharan countries, the projected annual economic growth rate is 3.7%, 
but high population growth may reduce the per-capita gain to 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, South Asian nations will increase output at a 5.1% annual rate, a 
per-capita hike of 3.2%. India's economy will expand at a 5.2% annual clip, a 
3.4% per-capita advance. 
</P>
<P>
East Asian countries will all but wipe out poverty, with an economic growth 
rate of 6.6% per year and a per-capita advance of 5.1%. China's economy will 
expand by 6.8% a year in the 1990s, down from 10.1% in the 1980s, with a 
per-capita gain of 5.4%. 
</P>
<P>
For Eastern Europe, the bank cautioned, the outlook is cloudy. Economic reforms 
and anti-inflationary measures will depress growth for a while, even with 
generous external assistance. Annual output expansion in the 1990s could 
average 1.9%, for a 1.5% per-capita gain. 
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, North Africa and developing countries of Europe, economic 
expansion is projected at a 4.3% annual clip, for a 2.1% per-capita gain. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and its affiliates, the principal source of financing for 
developing nations, lend over $20 billion a year for economic structural 
reforms and development projects.

We were mesmerized. There was no doubt, no second thought in my mind that I was 
going to pull that trigger, even though I didn't want to die. 
</P>
<P>
 -- James Vance 
</P>
<P>
That's how Sparks, Nev., teen-ager James Vance claimed he felt after listening 
to an album by British heavy-metal band Judas Priest the day he and a friend 
turned a gun on themselves and pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Vance's best friend, Raymond Belknap, 17, was killed by the self-inflicted 
gunshot on that Dec. 23, 1985, afternoon. Vance, 19, survived his suicide 
attempt, but was horribly disfigured and died three years later of 
complications possibly associated with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Parents of both young men believe the rock group was responsible for the deaths 
of their sons -- and are attempting to prove it in a court trial that begins 
today in the Washoe District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
In the unprecedented case, attorneys for the parents will try to persuade the 
judge that auditory subliminal messages caused the teen-agers to shoot 
themselves. The parents are seeking unspecified money damages to compensate for 
the deaths, and to support a child fathered by Vance after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
They are also seeking to recover money for medical bills plus punitive damages 
from CBS Records, which distributed "Stained Class," the 1978 Judas Priest 
album that the youths listened to that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth McKenna, co-counsel for the parents, said last week that he believes 
many rock bands presently use subliminal messages in their music and he hopes 
the Reno case will send a warning to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether we win or lose this case," McKenna said, "I hope rock bands start to 
get the message that they need to be more socially responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Suellen Fulstone, the attorney for CBS Records and Judas Priest, said the 
lawsuit may be motivated by reasons that have nothing to do with Judas Priest. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I would not presume to speak for the plaintiffs," Fulstone said, 
"this suit, like other product-liability suits, may simply be motivated by the 
possibility of recovering money." 
</P>
<P>
If the case against Judas Priest is successful it could have an impact on the 
way record companies view artistic expression, say industry observers. They 
believe it also could serve as an impetus for other families to file similar 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
But Washoe District Judge Jerry Whitehead, in a legal opinion last August, 
suggested that rock 'n' roll is not what is on trial in Reno but that the 
employment of auditory subliminal messages is. 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion, Whitehead, who will hear the trial, said that the court 
respected the First Amendment right of artists to express themselves, but that 
subliminal messages don't enjoy such privileges because they are aimed at the 
subconscious. 
</P>
<P>
He based his conclusion on three grounds: 
</P>
<P>
* Subliminal communication does not advance any of the purposes of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
* An individual has a First Amendment right to be free from unwanted speech. 
</P>
<P>
* The listener's right of privacy outweighs the speaker's right of free speech 
when subliminal speech is used. 
</P>
<P>
"We must . . . decide whether, under the factual circumstances of this case, 
there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the subliminal communications 
were a legal cause of the Dec. 23, 1985, shootings." 
</P>
<P>
There is general agreement among all parties regarding the events in the hours 
preceding the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Vance and Belknap spent the afternoon in Belknap's bedroom in his parents' 
house, drinking beer, smoking pot and listening to Judas Priest music. In a 
sudden fit of violence, they started to punch and kick holes in the walls, 
destroying everything in the room but the stereo. 
</P>
<P>
The youths then picked up a 12-gauge sawed-off shotgun, jumped out the window 
and ran to the playground of a local church. Sitting on a merry-go-round, 
Belknap wedged the stock of the gun under his chin and pulled the trigger. 
Vance followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap died immediately. Vance blew the bottom of his face off, but survived, 
only to endure three years of painful reconstructive surgery before he died on 
Nov. 24, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the product-liability suit alleged that violent and suicidal themes 
present in Judas Priest's music were the causal factor in the deaths. Attorneys 
for the mothers of both teen-agers -- Aunetta Roberson and Phyllis Vance -- 
filed law suits against Judas Priest and CBS Records, the band's record 
company, in 1986. During the next year and a half, Vance cited specific lyrics 
from the song "Beyond the Realms of Death" as a motivating factor in the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
But by October, 1988, the parents' attorneys amended their original complaint, 
alleging that specific subliminal messages -- saying "Do it. Do it. . . . " -- 
had been implanted in a different Judas Priest song, "Better by You, Better 
Than Me," and that those messages, in tandem with the record's overt violent 
and suicidal imagery, precipitated the suicide attempt. (See related article on 
Page 11.) 
</P>
<P>
They also allege that the album contains at least two lines of lyrics that when 
played backward reveal satanic messages. 
</P>
<P>
Judas Priest vocalist Robert Halford denies that the band's music has ever 
sought to glorify suicide or satanism. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always believed that everything that Judas Priest has done will have a 
positive effect because of what we give to people through our music," Halford 
said in a 1988 court deposition. "My personal belief and opinion about this 
band from 1971 onwards is that everything we have done has been for the good." 
</P>
<P>
Subliminal messages are comparable to post-hypnotic suggestions, experts say, 
and have reportedly been used in advertising campaigns since the mid-'50s. 
</P>
<P>
The theory behind visual subliminal imagery, experts also maintain, is that 
while subliminal images may flash before the viewer at a very rapid speed, they 
can be detected by the human eye and registered in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Anthony Pellicano, a forensic audio specialist who will 
testify for CBS Records, the volume at which alleged auditory subliminal sounds 
are produced is not loud enough to cause the eardrum to vibrate. If the eardrum 
does not vibrate, he says, then the message cannot be sent to the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Fulstone, the Reno attorney representing CBS and the band, denies the existence 
of any subliminal content or backward sounds on the Judas Priest album. 
</P>
<P>
"The subliminal argument is all invention. It has absolutely no basis in fact," 
Fulstone said. "It is simply a vehicle for the plaintiffs to pursue a case that 
is otherwise marred by the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
Fulstone suggested that the suicide attempts had nothing to do with Judas 
Priest's music, but were prompted by a variety of social and psychological 
problems that had haunted the youths from childhood. 
</P>
<P>
She pointed to a history of crime, domestic violence and substance abuse in 
both of the youths' backgrounds, detailed in Whitehead's legal opinion. 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion, Whitehead said that Vance and Belknap were both violent 
individuals who had experienced academic and disciplinary problems. Among the 
drugs they used were LSD, speed, cocaine, marijuana and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Court records also reveal that both youths were physically abused by their 
parents as children, dropped out of school after the 10th grade and drifted 
from job to job. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe that it is a natural response for families who are experiencing 
genuine grief over the loss of a loved one to deal with those feelings by 
looking for someone to blame," Fulstone said. 
</P>
<P>
Responded McKenna, "Let me answer with a story. If you have a pretty young 
daughter and you tell her 20 times, 'Don't walk down the alley behind your 
house, it's dangerous.' You warn her, 'Don't wear a short dress.' And you say, 
'Don't talk to or take candy from strangers.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then one day she walks down that alley in a short dress and she takes candy 
from a freak who violates her, cuts her throat and kills her. She is obviously 
at fault. She disobeyed everything you told her to do. But who would you be 
angry at? 
</P>
<P>
"Is the freak a factor in the homicide? You bet he is. In this case, CBS is the 
freak." 
</P>
<P>
To persuade the court that subliminal messages could have led the two Reno 
teen-agers to shoot themselves, attorneys for the parents must first 
demonstrate that such messages actually exist on the Judas Priest album. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna and his co-counsel Timothy Post said they are prepared to do so through 
the use of a computer program that can detect such messages. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the attorneys will present testimony by Wilson Bryan Key, an 
author and lecturer who maintains that CBS employed subliminals in Judas 
Priest's music to increase the marketability of their albums. 
</P>
<P>
"The deaths of James Vance and Ray Belknap provide us with a textbook example 
of how subliminal messages surface in human behavior," said Key, who has 
consulted on nearly two dozen cases involving homicide, suicide and acts of 
violence. "As far as I'm concerned, this is just another example of corporate 
willingness to do anything they can to make a buck." 
</P>
<P>
Pellicano, the Los Angeles forensic audio specialist who will testify for CBS 
Records, maintained that there is no subliminal content or backward sounds 
anywhere on the recording. 
</P>
<P>
"The theory of subliminal messages advanced by the parents' attorneys borders 
on deceit and voodooism," Pellicano said. 
</P>
<P>
"For the plaintiffs to suggest that some auditory subliminal scheme is at work 
here, it implies that there was a conspiracy of evil in 1978 between Judas 
Priest, the engineers, the executives and everyone at CBS involved in the 
production to create an album that would cause young people to kill themselves. 
Does that sound credible to you?" 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last from three to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHRONOLOGY OF JUDAS PRIEST CASEThese are the steps that led to the Judas Priest 
trial: 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 23, 1985: Raymond Belknap, 17, and James Vance, 19, each attempted to 
commit suicide with a shotgun. Belknap died immediately, but Vance survived the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 24: Vance indicated to police that he attempted suicide because "life 
sucks." He did not blame Judas Priest. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 12, 1986: The father of John McCollum, a 19-year-old California youth who 
killed himself in 1984 after listening to a recording by Ozzy Osbourne, 
announced his intent to sue Osbourne and CBS Records over his son's death. 
Vance's mother read media accounts of the Osbourne suit, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
February: Aunetta Roberson (Belknap's mother) contacted attorney Kenneth 
McKenna and asked him to file a lawsuit against Judas Priest and CBS Records, 
McKenna said. McKenna then contacted the Vance family to see if they would be 
interested in joining the suit, but Phyllis Vance declined, according to court 
records. In the same month, McKenna called the attorney that filed the Osbourne 
suit and received copies of legal papers relating to the McCollum case. 
</P>
<P>
March: Vance told police in that the suicidal themes in Judas Priest's music 
might have caused the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
April: Vance wrote a letter to Belknap's mother saying that the Judas Priest 
album "mesmerized" both youths into believing the "answer to life was death." 
</P>
<P>
May 8: McKenna filed a lawsuit against Judas Priest and CBS Records on behalf 
of Roberson. 
</P>
<P>
July 10: A separate suit was filed on behalf of the Vance family. The cases 
were consolidated Dec. 3, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the parents asked CBS to turn over the 24-track master recording 
of Judas Priest's "Stained Class" album for analysis. McKenna said that CBS 
told him that the master recordings were lost. The company did deliver a master 
copy of one song on the album entitled "Better by You, Better Than Me." 
</P>
<P>
July 12, 1988: The California District Court of Appeals ruled that Osbourne's 
music is protected by the First Amendment and dismissed the McCollum suit. 
</P>
<P>
October, 1988: A Sacramento audio engineer allegedly detected "subliminal" 
messages on the Judas Priest song. The families then alleged that these 
subliminal messages precipitated the suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 15: James Vance was admitted to the psychiatric unit of the Washoe Medical 
Center; he died Nov. 24 of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 23, 1989: Washoe District Judge Jerry Whitehood ruled that subliminal 
messages are not protected by the First Amendment and recommended the case be 
tried before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
July 9, 1990: Whitehead accepted an agreement between both sides in the case to 
waive a jury trial.CHUCK PHILIPS

Donna Reed she's not. But Holly Hughes, that frisky femme of the performance 
world and author of plays whose titles you can't print in this newspaper, is 
cooking plenty. 
</P>
<P>
With her poet's ear tuned to the ironies of gay life, her life, and the 
ins-and-outs of waiting tables, Hughes is on the road to set some records 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
The New Yorker is one of four performance artists who were recently recommended 
for NEA support by a peer panel of theater experts and then denied that funding 
in an unprecedented action by NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these trying times, Hughes -- a Grove Press-published playwright, 
Jerome Foundation grantee and recipient of a MacDowell Fellowship -- refuses to 
let what she sees as the "open season on artists, whether they're publicly 
funded or not," stop her from making art. 
</P>
<P>
The world premiere of her performance "Dead Meat" ("I didn't know how prophetic 
my title would be," she quips. "I didn't plan to live up to it this way") comes 
to Highways on Tuesday for a benefit performance. The run continues Thursday as 
part of "Ecce Lesbo/Ecce Homo," Highways' second annual gay and lesbian 
performance festival. Later this month, Hughes reprises her solo, "World 
Without End." 
</P>
<P>
Tired from repeated sessions with the press and legal counsel, Hughes spoke 
about the Frohnmayer action from Seattle, where she was taking part in the 
National Gay and Lesbian Theater Festival. (Frohnmayer declined comment for 
this article.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'm furious," says Hughes. "All four of us are appealing the decision. Not 
only did we get our grants turned down, but before the overturnings were 
announced, (John) Fleck, Karen (Finley) and I were getting our careers 
demolished by misrepresentation in the press." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has been recommended for three NEA grants in different categories during 
the last three months. Before last year, when Congress installed a clause that 
requires grantees to sign a pledge to comply with restrictive language in the 
NEA's appropriations bill, Hughes was awarded a 1989 Inter-arts grant. 
</P>
<P>
In March, after the new language was in place, she won a 1990 playwriting 
grant. "I smeared the word lesbian all over my application," says Hughes. "I 
wanted to make it perfectly clear; I have yet to receive that money." 
</P>
<P>
After that award, says Hughes, the situation got much worse. "It was leaked to 
me in the spring that I'd been recommended for funding in the solo 
performance-artist category," she says, "but the solo fellowships had been 
deferred. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a gag order, but obviously somebody in the NEA was talking and 
misrepresenting the work," recalls Hughes. "I contacted Frohnmayer's office in 
early June when these distortions first started coming out in the Washington 
Times and said, 'What are you going to do about these leaks?' 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't committed any crime other than applying to the NEA," says Hughes. "I 
was offered all sorts of assurances that (Frohnmayer) was concerned and wanted 
to protect the artists." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, says Hughes, those promises apparently didn't matter next to what she 
describes as Frohnmayer's desire "to make sacrifices to the right wing. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect the one thing that politicians do all the time is leak something and 
see what the public response to it is," she says. "It's not impossible that 
these leaks were coming from Frohnmayer's office." 
</P>
<P>
"I have this fantasy: 'A Day in the Life of John Frohnmayer.' He wakes up in 
the morning and crawls on his belly to the door of (North Carolina Sen.) Jesse 
Helms. And he scratches on Helms' door and says, 'Ohhh, ohhhh, what can I do 
for you today? Take some more trash out of the NEA -- those lesbians, those 
feminists, those gay people -- and demolish the entire performance-art category 
and establish in its place maybe a bake-off?' " 
</P>
<P>
Kidding aside, Hughes says that Frohnmayer isn't doing his job. "Funding is 
supposed to be based on artistic merit alone," she says. "The chairman's job is 
to insulate (the process) from political realities, meaning Jesse Helms and 
(Lomita Rep.) Dana Rohrabacher." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the four "sacrifices," says Hughes, is politics. "It diverts 
attention," she says. "It's easier to de-fund four performance artists and to 
look like you're doing something, than to indict Charles Keating or the 
President's son" (both of whom are involved in savings and loan scandals). 
</P>
<P>
"The total of all four of our grants was just $23,000, which is just a weekend 
at Kennebunkport for the Bushes -- if they don't bring Millie along." 
</P>
<P>
Nor, says Hughes, does the assault on the arts stop with the defunding of the 
four performers. "Various organizations from the NEA to city governments are 
going after spaces that present us," says Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kitchen in New York is the subject of three grueling audits from the IRA. 
The WOW Cafe is getting eviction notices. Franklin Furnace was shut down, 
ostensibly for fire reasons, but really because they presented Karen (Finley). 
And Sushi in San Diego -- which has presented all four of us -- has been 
getting hate mail and phone calls because the religious right in San Diego has 
been complaining to the city council. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to remember other repressive cultures," Hughes continues. "It always 
begins with the censorship of artists, the lack of tolerance for dissent and 
the persecution of a minority."

SAGANSKY DEFENDS CONTENT OF A BATCH OF NEW CBS SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: EXECUTIVE SAYS THAT THE NETWORK WILL NOT CENSOR PRODUCERS. 
</P>

<P>
Jeff Sagansky, the Harvard MBA who took over six months ago as president of CBS 
Entertainment with the awesome job of bringing the network out of its 
third-place ratings morass, parried with the national TV press Sunday over 
sexual content in some of his upcoming shows. 
</P>
<P>
Sagansky, 37, joked that in terms of the traditional CBS audience, he would be 
considered "a younger viewer." He acknowledged that the network was in heated 
pursuit of a younger audience -- but at CBS that meant "less than 60 . . . but 
we're not looking for preschool." 
</P>
<P>
One reporter asked how sexy CBS was going with some of the content of "Uncle 
Buck," a new show spinning off the John Candy film, and "Evening Shade," a Burt 
Reynolds comedy being created by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason of "Designing 
Women." Earlier Sunday, she talked about this series having some sexual byplay 
between the adult characters. Both the new series are 8 p.m shows. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by one reporter what was becoming of the family hour, Sagansky said 
the network was being very sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
The reporter countered that some of the first words spoken on the "Uncle Buck" 
episode by a 6-year-old girl were "You suck." 
</P>
<P>
Sagansky stood his ground: "There's no chance that the words are going to 
change. . . . We have concerns but we're not going to censor them (the 
producers)." 
</P>
<P>
Another reporter rushed in: "How can you say, Mr. Sagansky, that the networks 
are more sensitive now when you let programs like 'Uncle Buck' come on the air 
with children saying these words that are not acceptable by a lot of American 
families today?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you," Sagansky said, "believe it or not, kids say that in homes all 
over America. We may not like it and it may not be acceptable in our group . . 
. (but) I don't think we can put on shows that have no relationship with 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
Sagansky pointed out that Uncle Buck "comes right down" on the child's remarks 
at one point. 
</P>
<P>
As for the spicy content of "Doctor Doctor," which is moving from 10:30 p.m. to 
8:30 p.m., Sagansky said there will only be "slight changes" and those "just in 
language."

VANDALS HURT CASE OF OTHER CRITICS OF THE CHURCH; 
</P>
<P>
CATHOLICS: ATTACKS ANGER SOME PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE AND STRENGTHEN THE RESOLVE 
OF THOSE WHO FAVOR CHURCH POLICIES ON ABORTION AND HOMOSEXUALITY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of the Roman Catholic Church's positions on abortion and 
homosexuality say unprecedented vandalism at local Catholic churches in the 
last seven months is making it harder for them to get their message across 
convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
Vandals make it "much more difficult because they anger people in the middle 
and damage the credibility of all of us who believe abortion should be legal 
and condoms should be available," said Frances Kissling, head of Catholics for 
a Free Choice. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, those who favor the church's policies say the attacks have 
strengthened their resolve. Such Catholics say they will not be intimidated nor 
turned aside from proclaiming that abortion is murder and the only "safe sex" 
for people risking sexually transmitted diseases is abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
"This energizes me," said Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony. "I feel more 
courageous in articulating our beliefs and practices." 
</P>
<P>
The latest vandalism happened last weekend at St. Catherine Laboure Church in 
Torrance and the headquarters of the Los Angeles Archdiocese in downtown Los 
Angeles. Vandals scrawled graffiti on walls, left behind red coat hangers and a 
mattress stuffed with animal entrails, and bolted a large wooden cross 
festooned with condoms to the church door. 
</P>
<P>
In December, four area Catholic churches were splattered with red paint. The 
Torrance church had previously been hit three times by vandals and St. Francis 
of Assisi Church in Silver Lake has been damaged five times by paint-slinging 
vandals. 
</P>
<P>
While spokesmen for AIDS activists, abortion-rights advocates and the leader of 
the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women said they do not 
condone such violence, they also said they understand the perpetrators' 
"anger." 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Bruce, head of the 4,000-member local NOW chapter, said the Catholic 
Church "will have to expect" such attacks. That is especially true, she said, 
in a diverse and opinionated city like Los Angeles when church leaders "assert 
a political position and meddle in people's private lives and try to legislate 
their views and lifestyles." 
</P>
<P>
Vandalism, added Bruce, who is also a member of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash 
Power, or Act-Up, is "an expression of the larger frustration many of the 
people are feeling who . . . don't have any other way of expressing it." 
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-member Act-Up LA has not been involved in vandalism at local Catholic 
facilities, spokesman Paul Sbrizzi said. But he added: "We certainly agree with 
the message behind what was done. As far as we're concerned, the Catholic 
Church is engaged in terrorism against women and gays and lesbians." 
</P>
<P>
In December, about 50 activists organized by Act-Up LA disrupted Masses at four 
Los Angeles-area churches to protest Mahony's just-reiterated stand against the 
use of condoms to curb the spread of AIDS. No physical damage or violence 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
According to a wire service report, an unidentified spokeswoman for a group 
called Artists Against Religious Oppression claimed responsibility for last 
weekend's vandalism. She said the "message" was that the church should stay out 
of politics and medicine, stop its oppression of women, gays and lesbians, and 
stop preaching sin and lies. 
</P>
<P>
Though churches have always been lightning rods for specific dissent, vandalism 
attacks "are relatively new and certainly disturbing," said Daniel Levitas, 
executive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal in Atlanta. A national 
resource center, the group responds to hate and bigotry-motivated activity. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, crimes against religious groups rose from 111 in 1988 to 
a record 125 last year, according to the Human Rights Commission. Graffiti was 
the most prevalent form of crime. 
</P>
<P>
Those holding a wide variety of views about abortion, homosexuality and AIDS 
were united in agreeing that vandalism and violence are counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
"The AIDS activist community . . . believes in nonviolence as a principle, and 
vandalism is a form of violence," said Dave Johnson, who is resigning his job 
as Los Angeles' first AIDS coordinator. "Acts like what happened last Sunday 
play right into the hands of the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Attacks on Catholic institutions in Los Angeles County have caused the Human 
Rights commissioners to ponder whether the incidents were truly "anti-Catholic 
hate crimes" or "just anger." 
</P>
<P>
The episodes protesting Catholic policies on abortion and AIDS were 
"specifically targeted against a dislike of church doctrine," concluded the 
commission's senior staff consultant, Bunny Nightwalker Hatcher. "It is indeed 
a hate crime. You cannot separate the (policy) statement from the faith," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Levitas, of the Center for Democratic Renewal, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, attacks against Catholic churches were displays of 
anti-Catholicism "pure and simple, like the Ku Klux Klan," he said. But now, he 
reasons, property crimes against the church are not hate crimes because 
Catholicism as a whole is not under attack. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a crime of intolerance but the primary motivation itself has to do with 
. . . disagreement over a specific and narrow question of doctrine," he said.

WITH A BOOST FROM JPL, JAPANESE LUNAR MISSION MAY GET BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena have come up with a way 
to salvage a troubled Japanese space mission, but they will need a little help 
from a strange area of space called the "fuzzy boundary." 
</P>
<P>
Japan became only the third nation in history to launch a successful lunar 
mission earlier this year when it sent a basketball-size probe into orbit 
around the moon. 
</P>
<P>
The achievement was hailed as a major one for Japan's Institute of Space and 
Astronautical Science. A small research center with an annual budget of only 
$150 million, it is the rival of Japan's more powerful and better endowed 
National Space Development Agency. 
</P>
<P>
But the success was diminished when the spacecraft's transmitter failed just as 
the probe reached the moon and it could not send back the scientific data it 
was sent to collect. 
</P>
<P>
Now experts at the Jet Propulsion Lab have devised a bold plan that could 
salvage Japan's mission by diverting the mother ship that launched the lunar 
orbiter and sending it to the moon also. The maneuver would be a tricky one, 
because the larger spacecraft was not designed for lunar orbit. But Japanese 
officials have eagerly embraced JPL's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
The joint Japanese-American effort began during an informal discussion, said 
Edward A. Belbruno, a mathematician at JPL who is among a handful of scientists 
dabbling in the fringe field of doing more with less -- almost heresy in 
today's world of space science. 
</P>
<P>
Belbruno and James K. Miller, an expert in orbital mechanics at JPL, think they 
have figured out how to get the mother ship -- now in an elliptical orbit 
around the Earth that carries it beyond the moon's orbital path -- to orbit no 
more than about 60 miles above the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
If the mother ship had been designed to do that, the task would have been 
relatively simple. At just the right moment as it was passing the moon, the 
craft could have slowed down by firing its engines, allowing the moon's gravity 
to pull it into close orbit. 
</P>
<P>
But the spacecraft carries only a limited amount of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they would spend too much propellant" if they tried to reach lunar 
orbit through traditional methods, Miller said. "They wouldn't be able to do 
anything when they got there." 
</P>
<P>
So, how does a spaceship get into lunar orbit when it wasn't designed to go 
there? 
</P>
<P>
In a recent report to Japanese officials, the two JPL scientists said the 
larger spacecraft could be put into lunar orbit by taking advantage of the 
"fuzzy boundary." That is a region of the sky about 1 million miles from Earth 
where the gravitational fields of the Earth and the sun nearly cancel each 
other out, leaving a spacecraft vulnerable to subtle influences. 
</P>
<P>
"Funny things can happen there," Belbruno said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller compared the fuzzy boundary, also known as a weak stabilization 
boundary, to the top of the arch created when a baseball is tossed into the 
air. At the top, the baseball is moving very slowly, and even a minor force can 
change its course substantially. 
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft could alter its course to carry it close to the moon by firing 
its thrusters while in the fuzzy boundary, where only a slight nudge would do 
the job. That would put it on the right course to intercept the moon, and the 
maneuver would use little fuel. Once it reaches the moon, the spacecraft could 
gently slip into orbit by once again firing its small thrusters inside another 
fuzzy boundary created by the canceling gravitational fields of the Earth, the 
sun and the moon. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan works, the spacecraft could provide valuable scientific data. 
Miller said it carries a highly sensitive tracking device, a Doppler 
transponder, that would allow scientists to monitor its flight precisely. That, 
in turn, should tell much about the moon's gravitational field, something that 
will be important in future moon missions. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Earth, the moon is "very irregular, a lumpy body," Miller said. So its 
gravitational field is somewhat irregular. Those irregularities could affect 
future satellites. 
</P>
<P>
However, the real payoff from the Belbruno-Miller proposal -- if it works -- 
could come in the years ahead when huge quantities of construction materials 
are needed to build a permanent lunar base. By learning to take advantage of 
the fuzzy boundary, scientists could save enormous amounts of fuel that 
normally would be needed to transport the heavy equipment and supplies, 
Belbruno said. 
</P>
<P>
The trip would take longer, about four months instead of three days, but "that 
translates into weight" that can be carried at no additional charge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials are now examining the proposal. In their latest 
communications with the JPL team, Japanese engineers said they had done the 
same computations and had come up with the same conclusions. The attempt to try 
it could come next April. 
</P>
<P>
GETTING TO THE MOON 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory have come up with a plan to send a 
Japanese spaceship with a low supply of fuel into lunar orbit with help from an 
area in space called the 'fuzzy boundary.' 
</P>
<P>
The fuzzy boundary is a region of space where the gravitational fields of Earth 
and the sun nearly cancel each other. 
</P>
<P>
1. Briefly firing the rocket's thrusters while in the fuzzy boundary between 
Earth and the sun will put it on course for the moon using very little fuel. 
</P>
<P>
2. A second firing in the Earth-moon fuzzy boundary will ease the spaceship 
into lunar orbit.

THE HORMONES BEHIND OUR GUT FEELINGS; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: SCIENTISTS ARE LEARNING HOW THE STOMACH AND BRAIN COMMUNICATE. THE 
LESSONS HOLD GREAT PROMISE FOR SUFFERERS OF MANY GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS.

<P>
In the early 19th Century, a young Canadian named Alex St. Martin suffered a 
gunshot wound that left a permanent opening in his stomach. This allowed his 
physician to make a striking observation -- the man's angry feelings slowed the 
passage of food through his stomach and hampered secretion of various stomach 
juices which aid digestion. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 years after the case was detailed in a book by the physician, Dr. 
William Beaumont, "Experiments and Observations on the Gastric Juice and the 
Physiology of Digestion," researchers are making headway into understanding the 
chemical ties between the brain and the gut. These ties help explain how stress 
and emotional upsets can prompt a repertoire of common gastrointestinal 
complaints including ulcers, diarrhea and constipation. The research suggests 
new treatment avenues for gastrointestinal disorders, including drugs that work 
on the brain rather than the gut to relieve "gut feelings." 
</P>
<P>
"We've made great strides in understanding how the brain and gut 'talk' to each 
other," said pharmacologist Cynthia Williams of the University of Texas in 
Houston. "There's really been an explosion of findings." 
</P>
<P>
That explosion was brought about by the discovery, over the last 20 years, of 
more than 50 different compounds generated by the brain. About a dozen of these 
have a dramatic effect on the gut. "It's been a rumor for a long time that many 
GI (gastrointestinal) tract disorders are caused by stress or other emotions," 
said Williams, "but until we had these compounds to play around with, we had no 
way of systematically evaluating it." 
</P>
<P>
One of the newer brain compounds to be discovered, corticotropin-releasing 
factor (CRF), plays a key role in wreaking the effects of stress on the colon, 
Williams' research suggests. Called a "master transmitter," CRF is released by 
the brain in response to stress and triggers a number of reactions in the body, 
including the boosting of heart rate and blood pressure and the suppression of 
food consumption and sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has shown that in rats, CRF propels food quickly through the colon, 
prompting excretion and, in high doses, diarrhea. The compound also slows the 
passage of food through the small intestine. The animals generated large 
amounts of CRF when they were stressed by being in a restraining harness. Other 
researchers have confirmed Williams' findings and shown that CRF also slows the 
emptying of stomach contents into the small intestine. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating food from the colon frees some of the body's blood supply so it can 
be used to enable a fast escape or a valiant fight. Slowing the passage of food 
through the small intestine and stomach makes an animal feel full so it will 
not have an urge to munch when faced with danger. 
</P>
<P>
The type of stress these animals experienced in Williams' studies is not 
exactly akin to the stress a person experiences during rush-hour traffic or at 
work. Other studies have shown, however, that mental stress, such as that 
generated when undergoing a rigorous personal interview, prompts the same 
changes in the human colon that Williams saw in rats. 
</P>
<P>
The cascade of hormones released in the human "fight or flight" response to 
stress appears to be universal among mammals. "When you're faced with a tiger 
in the woods," Williams explains, "you don't need your gastrointestinal 
functions. What you need, instead, is your heart pounding, sending a lot of 
blood to your muscles so you can quickly respond." Particularly promising is 
Williams' finding that when the rats were given a shot of a compound that 
partially blocks CRF's actions, it completely countered the effects of stress 
on the gut. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and colleague Thomas Burks of the University of Arizona in Tucson 
currently have a patent pending for the use of this CRF blocker to treat 
patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The hallmarks of this syndrome are 
chronic diarrhea or constipation with abdominal pain. The disorder afflicts 15% 
to 20% of the population, according to epidemiologist James Everhart of the 
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
No physical abnormalities explain the syndrome, although a number of studies 
link its occurrence to heightened stress. There currently is no effective 
treatment for the condition, which one gastroenterologist poetically called a 
manifestation of a "weeping colon." 
</P>
<P>
Burks has recently shown that CRF boosts the number of contractions in the 
junction between the large and small intestines. This could explain the 
incapacitating pain experienced by irritable bowel syndrome patients, he said, 
as well as their constipation and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
In other work, Yvette Tache of the UCLA Center for Ulcer Research and Education 
and her colleagues have uncovered two brain compounds that strongly influence 
whether animals develop stomach ulcers. Extremely small amounts of just one of 
these powerful chemicals, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), have been shown 
to trigger a host of reactions in the gut, all of which foster ulcers. In four 
species of animals, for example, Tache and others have found that TRH boosts 
contractions and secretion of acid in the stomach, stems the stomach's 
production of bicarbonate, which neutralizes acid, and affects blood flow in 
the stomach, making it more susceptible to ulcers. When TRH is given to rats, 
they develop stomach ulcers within just two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Although the links have not been proven conclusively, there is evidence to 
suggest that TRH is released in response to stress and can make animals more 
alert and responsive. It counteracts the depressant effects of certain drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the stomach, brain cells also generate a compound called 
gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), which has an opposite effect on the gut from 
TRH and protects animals from developing ulcers. Tache speculates that 
compounds such as GRP may be generated by the brain after a stressful situation 
to counteract the compounds induced by stress and bring the gut back to normal 
in most people. 
</P>
<P>
A French company is currently pursuing GRP as an anti-ulcer drug. 
</P>
<P>
"The beauty of our findings," said Tache, "is that from one small molecule 
working on just one site, you counter the gamut of response involved in ulcer 
formation. You could never get that kind of response by targeting a drug, as 
most current ulcer drugs do, to one aspect of ulcer formation. The cells that 
generate acid in the stomach, for example, don't also affect bicarbonate 
production." 
</P>
<P>
"Manipulating the system from the top down," she said, "can be much more 
effective because it gives you the overall body response you want." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have discovered several chemicals generated by the brain that have 
dramatic effects on the digestive system. Stress triggers the brain to produce 
some of these chemicals, creating a variety of gastrointestinal disorders, 
including diarrhea, constipation and ulcers. The research suggests that these 
digestive problems can be treated with other chemicals that work from the brain 
rather than on a specific area of the gut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'FIGHT OR FLIGHT' RESPONSE 
</P>
<P>
1. Brain releases CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor) in response to stress, 
stimulating changes throughout the body 
</P>
<P>
2. The heart rate and blood pressure increase, enabling muscles to respong 
quickly 
</P>
<P>
3. CRF slows passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine, reducing 
appetite 
</P>
<P>
4. Food is eliminated from the colon, freeing the body's blood supply 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STOMACH ULCERS 
</P>
<P>
TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) triggers a host of reactions in the 
stomach, causing ulcers. The hormone, triggered by stress, boosts contractions 
and secretion of acid in the stomach, stems production of bicarbonate, affects 
blood flow to stomach, making it more susceptible to ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
GRP (gastrin-releasing peptide) has an opposite effect on the gut as TRH and 
prevents the development of ulcers. Researchers suspect that GRP may be 
released after a stressful situation to counter the effects of TRH and bring 
the gut back to normal.

With sufficient time having passed for the science establishment to have 
settled into familiarity with the Bush Administration, our verdict is that 
science has got itself a bitter-sweet relationship, mostly sweet. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who puts exceptional effort into being liked, has been 
especially attentive to two of the basic cravings of science in its dealings 
with government: money and recognition. The budgets that Bush has proposed for 
research are generous by recent standards, though inevitably insufficient to 
satisfy the boundless ambitions of researchers. Still, he has supported the 
doubling of the National Science Foundation budget, begun the restoration of 
non-nuclear energy research, and has backed every mega-project on the agenda.

Bush has also been attentive on the ritualistic front, a matter on which the 
mandarins of science are as sensitive as banana republic generals. He addressed 
the recent annual meeting of the high temple of science, the National Academy 
of Sciences. What he mainly delivered was a rehash of shopworn material from 
speeches and congressional testimony of his science adviser. But the academy 
folk were nonetheless touched by his presence, mindful that the last 
presidential visitor was Jimmy Carter, and before that, John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
In accord with many pleas from the leaders of research, Bush has resurrected 
the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from the catalepsy into 
which it lapsed in the final Reagan years. His science adviser, D. Allan 
Bromley, regularly wows the audiences in his many appearances around 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But even with those positive notes, the halls of science ring with grievances, 
for besides money and recognition, there's a third item of consummate 
importance to science in its dealings with government: autonomy in research. 
Scientists don't want dictates on what to research and what not to research. 
And here the abortion issue has intruded on a major segment of science, 
biomedical researchers. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institutes of Health has now been leaderless for nearly a year, 
thanks to the pro-life "litmus test" that repelled the first batch of 
candidates and chilled the interest of others. A pledge to desist has been 
given by hardliners responsible for the debacle, Assistant Secretary of Health 
James O. Mason and his henchmen in the Department of Health and Human Services. 
But few trust them, and the distrust has been boosted by Mason's reaffirmation 
of the ban on federal funds for fetal-tissue research. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has steered clear of public involvement with the fetal-tissue controversy 
and the ground rules for NIH directorship. And the leaders of science have 
prudently avoided open criticism of him on these matters, though in private, 
some are intensely scornful. However, many give Bush the benefit of the doubt, 
saying he's got to appease the right. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Bush and science get on very well. Usually depending on where they 
are situated professionally, some leaders of science feel dissatisfaction, 
ranging from the intrusion of the abortion issue to the Administration's heavy 
splurging on mega-projects while "little science" is gasping. Others are 
frustrated by the slow pace of change to civilian research and the 
Administration's incoherence on the federal role in assisting high-tech 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush's carefully adopted pose of nice-guy, 
trying-hard-in-difficult-circumstances has won science, as it has the general 
public. The leaders feel they have a friend in the White House.

An asteroid hurtled across Earth's orbit at a distance of only 3 million miles 
last week in a passing that planetary scientists consider a close encounter. 
The asteroid, dubbed 1990 MF, made one of the closest crossings of Earth orbit 
observed in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
It had been tracked since Jet Propulsion Laboratory planetary scientist Eleanor 
Helin discovered it June 26. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists estimated the rocky object's diameter at 300 to 1,000 feet and said 
the radiant asteroid accelerated to 22,000 m.p.h. at its closest approach. 
Initial calculations indicate the asteroid has an elongated orbit of 161 
million miles that takes two years and four months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the closest asteroid orbit yet known came within about 470,000 miles 
of the Earth.

BOY, 8, WAS STRANGLED, AUTOPSY FINDS; MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An autopsy found that 8-year-old Carlos Alberto Pineda was strangled, the 
coroner's office said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the boy, who had been missing for six days, was found Friday 
afternoon at an apartment construction site at Muirfield Road and Edgewood 
Place in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
His mother's boyfriend, Manuel Morales, 25, worked at the location and lived 
nearby. He was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of child abduction after the boy 
vanished, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Morales has denied having anything to do with the boy's disappearance, telling 
officers that he was taken from him by robbers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was last seen on July 7 when he left his mother's house with Morales, 
ostensibly to borrow $1,500 for a trip she wanted to take back to her native El 
Salvador. Police said Morales and Adela Pineda had quarreled the day before 
about the trip, and Morales had threatened "to do something she would remember 
for the rest of her life," if she left. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, however, he relented, and left with the boy to borrow money for 
the trip, officers said.

GARDEN GROVE MAN, HELD FOR DRUNKENNESS, DIES IN POLICE CELL

<TEXT>
<P>
A man who was arrested on suspicion of public drunkenness died in a holding 
cell Sunday night when he apparently choked on his own vomit, Garden Grove 
police said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Nasr Mohamed, 42, of Garden Grove, who was taken into custody at 8:25 p.m. for 
intoxicated behavior while standing outside a supermarket at Euclid Street and 
Chapman Avenue, was pronounced dead by paramedics about 10:15 p.m., Police Sgt. 
Steve Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
After taking Mohamed into custody, police took him to the police station, and 
locked him into one of three holding cells monitored by television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders said Mohamed's body was discovered by Sgt. Dan Lyons, night watch 
commander, while he was making routine rounds of the cells. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief John Robertson said police could not foresee Mohamed's death. He 
described the man as a "cooperative intoxicated person," who immediately "laid 
down and fell right asleep." 
</P>
<P>
Although autopsy results are not due until late this afternoon, police 
speculated that Mohamed died when he began vomiting and was unable to wake up 
fully.

Seven Cubans broke into the Czechoslovak Embassy in Havana today and took four 
diplomats hostage, the state CTK news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government news agency Notimex, in a report from Havana, said the 
seven demanded a plane to take them to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The incident came after five Cubans seeking asylum occupied the apartment of 
the charge d'affaires Friday and held him hostage for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Charge d'affaires Jan Doemoek was among the diplomats CTK said are being held 
hostage today. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the seven Cubans broke into the embassy building this 
morning and took the diplomats hostage as they were holding a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
It said that the diplomats held hostage include, in addition to Doemoek, a 
commercial counselor, a press secretary and a Foreign Ministry official who had 
come to Havana to help negotiate a solution for the 12 Cubans who have sought 
refuge in the embassy over the past week.

DRASTIC CUTBACKS LOOM AS U.S. HIKES ITS '91 ESTIMATE;

<P>
The Bush Administration today dramatically boosted its official estimate of the 
fiscal 1991 budget deficit to $168.8 billion, two-thirds higher than its 
forecast just six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The increase could force automatic spending cuts of more than $100 billion if 
Congress and the Administration fail to agree on a package of spending 
reductions and tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Today's estimate did not include the costs of bailing out the savings and loan 
industry. When those costs are included, the deficit for the fiscal year that 
begins Oct. 1 climbs to $231.4 billion, the White House said in its official 
mid-session review of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration had estimated the budget deficit at $100.5 billion when 
the President's budget was released in January. 
</P>
<P>
The new deficit estimate is also significantly higher than the $64-billion 
deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress is unable to reduce the deficit to within $10 billion of the 
$64-billion target, automatic across-the-board spending cuts will take effect. 
</P>
<P>
Along with its new deficit estimate, the Administration included dire warnings 
of what could happen if the current budget negotiations between Congress and 
the Administration fail and the across-the-board cuts are triggered. 
</P>
<P>
White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman called across-the-board cuts of 
more than $100 billion unprecedented in their magnitude and "highly disruptive" 
to a host of government programs. 
</P>
<P>
Darman said such a reduction would require a 38.4% cut in non-defense spending 
and cuts of between 25.1% and 43.3% in military programs. Social Security and 
some other entitlement programs are exempt from Gramm-Rudman cuts, forcing even 
sharper reductions in other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Darman said the Gramm-Rudman cuts would force major reductions in air traffic 
control operations, increasing delays for air passengers by 400% to 600%. The 
cuts also would require a 40% reduction in the Head Start program, affecting 
200,000 4-year-olds, and curbs on other government programs ranging from 
poultry and meat inspections to cleanup of Superfund toxic waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
"If the summit negotiation fails, these effects are exactly what we will face 
in the fall," Darman said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's new estimates make it highly likely that the Gramm-Rudman 
law will have to be at least modified, given the size of the cuts needed to 
reach the $64-billion target. The Administration and Congress have been 
discussing spending cuts and tax increases in a range of between $50 billion 
and $60 billion, about half of what would be needed with the new estimates. 
</P>
<P>
By emphasizing a deficit figure that did not include the savings and loan 
bailout, the Administration seemed to be laying the groundwork for removing 
this giant expenditure from the Gramm-Rudman calculations, something that many 
members of Congress have also proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration blamed the sharp deterioration in the deficit on the 
higher-than-expected savings and loan bailout, weaker economic growth and 
higher interest rates.

N.Y. JOGGER TESTIFIES ABOUT INJURIES IN 'WILDING' ATTACK

<P>
The jogger who was raped and beaten during a "wilding" attack in Central Park 
emerged in public for the first time today to testify against her accused 
attackers and about the injuries she suffered. 
</P>
<P>
The blonde woman, who prosecutors say was gang raped and left for dead in the 
April 19, 1989, attack, spoke in a clear and firm voice as she told about 
waking up in a hospital more than a month after the brutal assault. 
</P>
<P>
A ragged scar was visible on her face, beginning above her left eyebrow and 
extending down her left cheek. The woman walked shakily to the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Three youths are on trial in the attack on the young investment banker. Antron 
McCray, 16, Yusef Salaam, 16, and Raymond Santana, 15, have been charged with 
13 criminal counts, including attempted murder, rape and sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you suffer any lasting injuries as a result of what happened to you on 
April 19, 1989?" asked Assistant Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Lederer. 
</P>
<P>
"I have problems with balance when I'm walking, and coordination. At times, 
I'll veer off to the right or the left," she said. "I have trouble walking down 
steps. I also lost my sense of smell completely. That has not come back." 
</P>
<P>
"I have double vision. When I'm reading, I hold papers over to the left to 
compensate. It takes a fair amount of concentration to make the image one." 
</P>
<P>
Lederer showed the woman the T-shirt, now almost completely brown with dried 
blood, that she wore when she was attacked while she was running. Doctors have 
said she lost three-quarters of her blood before she was found hours after the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you recognize this?" Lederer asked the woman. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the shirt that I used to wear," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to April 19, 1989, what color was it?" Lederer asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It was white," she answered. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old woman, who has since resumed her job and has been promoted to 
vice president at the Salomon Brothers Inc. investment bank, was found the 
night of the attack lying in a mud puddle, bound, gagged and naked. 
</P>
<P>
State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Galligan granted the jogger's request that 
courtroom artists not make any sketches of her, saying it was a "minimal" 
request that the media should honor. Most news organizations have withheld the 
woman's identity from the public because of the nature of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The woman did not seem to look at the defendants as she testified. 
</P>
<P>
There was no cross-examination by attorneys for the three teen-agers accused of 
attacking her.

Sheriff's deputies today went to the Lorraine Motel, the site of Martin Luther 
King's assassination, and dragged away a woman who had been camped outside the 
site for nearly three years in the hope of thwarting plans to turn the motel 
into a museum. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Smith, 39, who lived in the motel for 11 years and was its last 
resident, and four supporters were hauled across the street and her belongings 
were left in the street. 
</P>
<P>
While construction workers at the Lorraine National Civil Rights Museum waited, 
six deputies and two assistant chiefs dragged away Smith and four other people 
who had joined her at her tent while they were praying. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has been protesting the state's decision to build the Lorraine National 
Civil Rights Museum at the motel, saying that King would be better honored by a 
homeless shelter or medical clinic at the site.

A Toronto public relations consultant won substantial undisclosed libel damages 
today over a London newspaper report on rumors of a romance between her and 
Mark Phillips, the estranged husband of Britain's Priness Anne. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand-born Kathy Birks sued over an article in the tabloid Today last 
September, headlined "Mark's falling under the spell of seductive Kathy." 
</P>
<P>
The report alleged she had become Phillips' constant companion on his business 
trips across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Birks' lawyer, Keith Schilling, told the High Court in London that the article 
appeared after the announcement last August that Phillips and Princess Anne 
were to live apart. 
</P>
<P>
Schilling said Birks, who lives in Toronto, was "concerned that the article 
suggested she had seduced Capt. Phillips and readers might have concluded that 
she was to blame, wholly or in part, for the breakdown of his marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Today said any such suggestion would be untrue and agreed to pay Birks damages 
and her legal costs.

<P>
A major earthquake rocked Manila and surrounding Luzon island today and 
officials reported at least 88 people killed and scores of buildings destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
More than 130 others were injured. Hundreds were believed trapped under the 
rubble of crumbled buildings, including 150 reportedly trapped in the Hyatt 
Hotel in the mountain resort of Baguio. 
</P>
<P>
The death toll was expected to rise as rescue operations proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
The quake struck about 4:30 p.m, and the Institute of Seismology and 
Vulcanology said it was centered just south of Cabanatuan, a city of 80,000, 60 
miles north of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., registered the quake at 7.7 on the 
Richter scale. The June 21 earthquake in Iran registered between 7.3 and 7.7 
and killed at least 40,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
There were scores of aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Civil Defense said the six-story Philippine Christian College 
collapsed in Cabanatuan. 
</P>
<P>
The office said at least 30 people were killed in Cabanatuan and outlying 
areas. Officials there said hundreds of students were unaccounted for, but it 
was uncertain how many were in the building when it collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
In Baguio, 110 miles to the north of Manila, portions of several luxury hotels 
collapsed. The Manila radio station DZRH said 150 people were trapped in the 
Hyatt Hotel. A woman who identified herself as a public relations officer of 
the hotel said most of those trapped were in the casino. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Baguio appealed for heavy equipment and for blood, which they said 
was in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said medical supplies had been sent to 
Baguio by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force Master Sgt. Dan Fuller, reached by telephone at the U.S.-run Camp 
John Hay in Baguio, said the city was without electricity and that damage was 
widespread. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had structural damage here on base," he said. "We do have seven 
buildings downtown, which, as far as we know, they are completely fallen in." 
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. personnel assisted in rescue efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross reported five dead in Baguio but feared that the toll could go 
much higher. The Red Cross reported four dead in the northern province of 
Pangasinan. 
</P>
<P>
One person died of injuries in Manila, where the temblor cracked buildings, 
knocked out electricity and communications and sent thousands fleeing into the 
streets. One fire broke out in the city's Santa Cruz district. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor knocked several radio stations temporarily off the air. Stop lights 
in Manila were knocked out of service, creating huge traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
A radio station in Dagupan, 100 miles north of Manila, said 13 people were 
killed there, but the report could not be confirmed. It said all died in 
stampedes as panic-stricken people tried to flee a movie theater and schools. 
</P>
<P>
Officials reported widespread damage throughout Luzon, where many towns and 
cities were without power. 
</P>
<P>
Radio station DZRH quoted an affiliate station as saying a church in the 
northern province of Ilocos Sur collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
President Corazon Aquino ordered the military to launch an island-wide rescue 
operation. Her spokesman, Adolf Azcuna, said the president was meeting senators 
in her office when the quake struck, and she took cover under a table. 
</P>
<P>
A quake measured at 7.8 struck the Philippines in 1976, killing 8,000 people. 
Most of them died in a tidal wave which struck the southern island of Mindanao.

RJR NABISCO RESTRUCTURES TO CUT DEBT

RJR Nabisco Inc. said today it is beginning a $6.9-billion refinancing that 
will retire the debt-ladened company's most troublesome junk bonds and leave it 
with a more conservative balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
The food and tobacco giant said $4.45 billion of its high-yield, high-risk junk 
bonds, issued to help finance its record $24.9-billion leveraged buyout last 
year, and $2 billion of other costly forms of debt will be replaced with 
lower-cost bank debt, preferred stock and new equity. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. said the program is expected to leave the 
company with total debt of less than $20 billion and total equity of about $4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company estimated its debt-to-equity ratio would drop to 5-to-1 at the 
completion of the restructuring as compared to 23-to-1 last March. 
</P>
<P>
"This comprehensive recapitalization initiates the second major phase of our 
rebuilding program for RJR Nabisco," Gerstner said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
While the first phase included the divestiture of $5.5 billion in assets and 
strategic changes to increase cash flow and improve profit margins, Gerstner 
said the second phase will increase equity in the company by more than $3 
billion, significantly reduce high-cost debt and eliminate all remaining 
temporary bridge loans used to help finance the buyout.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS TO TRIM 17,000 JOBS; 
</P>
<P>
TROUBLED AIRCRAFT MAKER HOPES FOR $700 MILLION IN CUTS

<P>
McDonnell Douglas Corp. said today it will cut up to 11% of its work force or 
17,000 jobs by the end of the year, including 9,000 in Southern California, 
under a plan by the troubled aerospace giant to reduce costs by more than $700 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to do everything else," John F. McDonnell, chairman and chief 
executive officer, told a news conference. "But in the final analysis we had to 
come to this." 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs will affect salaried and hourly jobs at all of McDonnell Douglas' 
companies and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The news release said 4,500 jobs in St. Louis would be lost. In California 
alone, about 9,000 jobs will be lost, including about 8,000 at the Douglas 
Aircraft Co. commercial airplane facility in Long Beach. A large portion of the 
Long Beach cutback had been announced earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 800 people will be laid off at a helicopter operation in Mesa, 
Ariz., and another 1,000 jobs will be eliminated elsewhere in the country, the 
company said. With attrition, job eliminations and layoffs, the company said, 
up to 17,000 positions could be trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
The cost-cutting plan also includes reduced capital budgets, significant cuts 
in budgets for travel, consultants, advertising and other support activities, 
restrictions on overtime and a 50% reduction in company contributions to the 
salaried savings plans. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the plan to employees, McDonnell said he "deeply regretted the 
pain and hardship these cuts will cause to thousands of people who have (been) 
valued and dedicated employees." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell said job fairs, resume services and counseling would be offered to 
help laid-off workers find new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts have been expected for several weeks, since the company announced 
plans for significant layoffs in an effort to cut expenses and bolster its 
sagging financial performance. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas has been struggling financially due to cutbacks in the 
defense industry and costly development problems in both military and 
commercial aircraft projects. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock was down $1.50 a share at $43.37 1/2 in midday trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we can make these cuts so that they will not jeopardize our 
technological capability or undermine our ability to deliver quality products 
on time," McDonnell said. "What they will do is give us a more competitive cost 
structure -- one that will improve our financial strength and increase our 
ability to satisfy our customers." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas earned $2 million during its first quarter, down 98% from a 
year earlier. The drop stemmed mainly from huge losses at Douglas Aircraft, 
which primarily builds commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
The company, the nation's biggest defense contractor, also faces an uncertain 
future in the defense business as the Pentagon slashes spending. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Armed Service Committee on Friday approved a $289-billion defense 
authorization bill that would slash the Pentagon's proposed budget further and 
cloud the future of several major aircraft programs. 
</P>
<P>
The company faces serious cost problems on three military programs, the C-17 
cargo plane, the A-12 advanced tactical aircraft and the T-45 Goshawk trainer. 
</P>
<P>
It also faces large investment costs in its not-yet-certified MD-11 commercial 
jumbo jet.

BUSINESS SALES JUMP 0.9% IN GOOD SIGN FOR ECONOMY

<P>
Business sales shot up 0.9% in May, the biggest jump in three months, while 
inventories rose modestly, the government said today in a report indicating 
continued economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $538.3 
billion, up 0.9%. 
</P>
<P>
It was the strongest increase since February, when sales rose 1.4%, and 
followed a 1.0% decline in April. 
</P>
<P>
Inventories held on shelves and back lots in May totaled a seasonally adjusted 
$799.4 billion, up 0.4% following a 0.3% increase in April. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of strong sales and a moderate increase in inventories produced 
a 1.48 ratio of inventories to sales, down slightly from 1.49 in April. The 
ratio means that it would take 1.48 months to exhaust the backlog of goods at 
the May sales pace. 
</P>
<P>
Today's report, which was in line with economists' expectations, provided fresh 
evidence that the economy is not in danger of toppling immediately into a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
If inventories were to rise excessively in relation to sales, it could cause 
production cutbacks and job layoffs at factories as businesses attempted to 
sell off their goods backlog. 
</P>
<P>
Inventories have remained under control so far this year despite lackluster 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers showed the biggest sales gain in May, 2.0%, while sales fell 0.6% 
at retail stores. Wholesalers reported a 0.6% increase. 
</P>
<P>
In an advance estimate, the Commerce Department said last week that retail 
sales rose 0.5% in June, the first increase in five months. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in inventories, meanwhile, was greatest at wholesale 
establishments, up 1.2%. Retail backlogs rose a moderate 0.4% while inventories 
at factories were unchanged.

A pipeline has ruptured in the Ural mountains, spewing 735 million cubic feet 
of natural gas into the air, the official Tass press agency reported today. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident this weekend, a corroded oil pipeline sprang a leak, the 
oil caught fire, and 27 wells had to be shut down, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
An official blamed poor construction and maintenance for the accidents. 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, the pipeline rupture halted supplies of more than 3,500 
million cubic feet of natural gas coming from the Tyumen region, 900 miles east 
of Moscow.

FINDING WORK IS NEVER A PROBLEM FOR BOB SAGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ZURAWIK, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I mean, 'Videos' is a fad, obviously," Bob Saget said. "And people are going 
to be saturated with a lot of video shows. I think there's a 24-hour video 
channel coming on. But, I think, you know, whatever happens, happens. I'm not 
going to run around scared. I'll just find something else to do -- maybe lawn 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Finding work is not exactly a problem these days for Bob Saget. The comedian 
stars in two of television's hottest shows. Saget is host of ABC's "America's 
Funniest Home Videos," which soared into the Nielsen Top 10 this spring and 
never left, spawning numerous imitators and boosting sales of home video 
equipment across the country. 
</P>
<P>
He also stars as Danny Tanner in the ABC Top 20 sitcom "Full House." Tanner is 
the single parent of three daughters in the show. 
</P>
<P>
Saget met with television critics for a press conference in Los Angeles to 
promote yet another television show, his HBO special "Bob Saget: In the Dream 
State," which premieres Aug. 4 on the cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
The show is a combination of dramatized dream sequences and stand-up comedy 
performances by Saget, who directed the show and co-wrote it with his wife, 
Sherri Kramer Saget, an attorney turned writer. The Sagets have two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Saget's status as a parent is important because so much of his on-screen 
persona is connected with parenting. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what makes his Danny Tanner character so appealing to the preteen 
audience for "Full House" is that the three children run the house he's 
supposed to be running. In that way, he's a child's dream parent. Saget also 
cultivates that image in his HBO special. 
</P>
<P>
"The HBO show is actually about being a parent and trying to get stuff done, 
but you can't because you're up all night," Saget said. "People would say it 
has a yuppie, 'thirtysomething' kind of feel to it sometimes. . . . It really 
has a lot of me in it." 
</P>
<P>
Saget said that because of the runaway ratings success of "America's Funniest 
Homes Videos," being himself these days mainly means being busy. 
</P>
<P>
"The success of 'Videos' has made me busier. But even when I didn't have any 
work, I would always find a lot of work for myself to do," he said. "I've 
always been kind of a workaholic, and I love working a lot. That's why I love 
juggling all these shows." 
</P>
<P>
Juggling involves taping "Full House" Monday through Thursday and "Funniest 
Home Videos" on Friday. "And I'm also one of the writers on 'Videos,' " Saget 
said. "So (the other writers) will come to my dressing room at 'Full House' 
during the week when both shows are in production. . . . And, during lunch 
hours and in between scenes I'm not in on 'Full House,' we'll be writing the 
'Videos' show." 
</P>
<P>
Saget sidestepped the controversy surrounding the use of videos that show 
people or animals being hurt. "I don't choose the videos. Some I like. Some I 
don't like. And that's the way it is."

Rocker David Lee Roth has caught the wary eye of city officials with a 
20-foot-high portrait of a scantily clad woman on the outside wall of a 
recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
The portrait, with Roth's name emblazoned across the woman's chest, is on the 
rear wall of Little Mountain Sound studio, where fans waiting for a peek of 
favorite rockers who record there have sprayed a montage of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Roth, former lead singer of Van Halen, commissioned the airbrushed artwork that 
went up last month as a "poetic and symbolic tribute to the city of Vancouver," 
said his road manager, Eddie Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"What better (tribute) than a beautiful woman sitting amidst the city?" 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials don't see it that way. They're getting complaints and have told 
the studio's owners they must apply for a wall mural permit. Even with a 
permit, the city may decide to order the portrait's removal, said Jack Perry, 
deputy chief license inspector for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Among other rockers who use the studio are Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, Motley Crue and 
Whitesnake.

'DIE HARD 2' HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PAT H. BROESKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With $14.5 million in ticket sales at more than 2,500 theaters, 20th Century 
Fox's "Die Hard 2" held on to the No. 1 spot at the box office for the second 
week in a row. Starring Bruce Willis as an off-duty cop who single-handedly 
takes on a group of terrorists who virtually take control of a Washington 
airport, the action-adventure has now earned more than $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
But "Die Hard 2" aside, the big news was the startling performance of Paramount 
Pictures' "Ghost," which looks to be materializing as a summer sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
Starring Patrick Swayze as a deceased Wall Street investor who teams with 
charlatan psychic Whoopi Goldberg to help save the life of his endangered lover 
Demi Moore, the romantic comedy-drama was ranked second with ticket sales of 
$12.1 million on 1,101 screens, and a spirited per-screen average of $11,073. 
That's the second-highest per-screen average of the summer, following the 
opening weekend performance of Tri-Star's "Total Recall," which had a 
per-screen average of $12,395 (with ticket sales of $25.5 million on 2,060 
screens). 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, both Fox's "Ford Fairlane," starring controversial Andrew Dice 
Clay as a "rock 'n' roll detective" and Warner Bros.' Bill Murray comedy, 
"Quick Change," had disappointing debuts. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-place "Ford Fairlane" had ticket sales of about $6.5 million at 1,246 
screens, for about $5,216 per-screen. Ranked seventh, "Quick Change" had about 
$4.7 million in ticket sales at 1,596 screens, a per-screen average of about 
$3,007. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Paramount's racing drama "Days of Thunder" took third, dropping only 
about 22% from the previous week. With weekend ticket sales of more than $8 
million, the heavily promoted Tom Cruise vehicle has now grossed more than $54 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney animated perennial, "Jungle Book," was fourth with ticket sales of 
$7.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the weekend's top 10, in estimated figures: the Disney Studio's 
"Dick Tracy," $4.8 million ($85 million cumulative); Universal's "The Jetsons," 
$3.1 million ($9 million); "Total Recall," $3.1 million ($104 million); 
Paramount's "Another 48 HRS.," $3 million ($71 million).

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: BAG BALM FOR COW'S UDDERS UTTER SUCCESS ON DRY SKIN

<P>
Every once in a while we get a letter from a reader of this column that makes 
us laugh. That's how we reacted when a farmer's wife recommended Bag Balm, an 
old-time udder cream, for dry, cracked skin. 
</P>
<P>
When we shared this remedy with our readers, we were astounded by the response. 
Hundreds of people wrote in to confirm that what's good for cows also works for 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Many people were distressed that they could not find Bag Balm or its 
alternative Bova Cream in their local pharmacies or department stores. They 
didn't think to check an agricultural supply for their beauty aids. Farm co-ops 
are not easily accessible to city folk.

When we offered an address for the co-op distributor of Bova Cream, thousands 
of letters poured in. But dozens of disappointed readers wrote us to say that 
their nearest distributor would sell Bova Cream only by the case. Twelve 
10-ounce jars could be a lifetime supply of this stuff for a person who doesn't 
have a barnful of milk cows out back. 
</P>
<P>
You can order the same genre directly from the manufacturers. Udder Cream, 
which smells more like hand cream than a barnyard product, can be ordered by 
calling 1-800-345-7339 or writing Redex Industries Inc. P.O. Box 939, Salem, OH 
44460.

Bag Balm is made by Dairy Assn. Co., Lyndonville, VT 05851. This small company 
has been making Bag Balm for decades in the same familiar green tin. They sell 
directly to consumers, or you can order through the Burpee catalogue or the 
Vermont Country Store mail order office (P.O. Box 3000, Manchester Center, VT 
05255). Two 10-ounce cans cost $10.50. 
</P>
<P>
For seriously chapped hands, you can also buy a pair of cotton sleeping gloves. 
After applying the udder salve at bedtime, pull on the gloves for better 
absorption.

Jane Pauley has had it all -- even hives. 
</P>
<P>
The former "Today" co-host, now a fill-in anchor on the "NBC Nightly News," 
told New York magazine that at age 7, she broke into hives after being punished 
for another child's prank. 
</P>
<P>
"My eyes swelled up or something glamorous like that and my mother had to take 
me home from school," she said. "Later she took me to a specialist who said 
that I was a nervous child who would have to be careful my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
Pauley added: 'This is good information for a kid who is anxious about life. 
Instead I grew up to do live television. I think it's kind of funny." 
</P>
<P>
Pauley got over her problems with hives and headaches years ago, the magazine 
reported in its July 23 issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg LeMond, Eric Breukink and Pedro Delgado, conserving themselves for 
Tuesday's more difficult stage, finished almost five minutes behind Frenchman 
Charly Mottet in today's 15th stage of the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
The 105.5-mile leg from Millau to Revel was flat and dull, with the leaders 
staying in the pack and out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Overall leader Claudio Chiappucci of Italy gained three seconds over the main 
contenders and leads by 1 minute, 52 seconds over Breukink, 2:24 over LeMond 
and 4:29 over Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
Mottet averaged a fast 25 m.p.h. to finish in 4 hours, 13 minutes, 56 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Mottet, who had a disappointing first two weeks of the Tour and was only 37th 
overall, more than a half-hour behind Chiappucci, was understandably delighted. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a beautiful victory for me," he exclaimed soon after crossing the 
line, arms raised in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working for (French teammate Thierry) Claveyrolat but I felt so good I 
decided to have a go myself. It was difficult but I finished very strongly." 
</P>
<P>
Mottet, 27, placed sixth in last year's Tour. Despite brilliant performances in 
shorter stage events, he has rarely shone in the race that counts most. 
</P>
<P>
After starting among the favorites for this year's race but flopping once 
again, he acknowledged only a few days ago that he was probably not cut out to 
be a Tour de France champion. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures cooled slightly, but it was still close to 80 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's 16th stage looks to be the most important of the Tour, with three 
major climbs on the way to Luz Ardiden. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the title will be decided in the final stages. 
</P>
<P>
Also as expected, LeMond is one of the contenders as the race heads to Paris, 
where it will finish on July 22. The American had a number of question marks 
prior to the Tour. But once it started, LeMond was ready. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time champion said the key to the race will be the final two mountain 
stages, especially the route to Luz Ardiden. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond said he doesn't think Chiappucci is the main competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Delgado and Breukink are the ones to watch. Chiappucci is not a 
major contender." 
</P>
<P>
Delgado is especially dangerous. The Spaniard is a noted climber and very 
motivated this year. He will have a number of home-country supporters as the 
Tour enters the mountain range that borders France and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Luz Ardiden ends the second-most difficult stage of the Tour, with three major 
climbs over the last 36 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer it to be tough," LeMond said. "Usually, I am very consistent. When I 
have a weak day, I usually don't manage to lose time. I am counting on Luz 
Ardiden to make the difference." 
</P>
<P>
When he gained 30 seconds on Delgado in Saturday's stage, LeMond was hoping to 
cut more after he and Breukink pushed the action in the 13th stage. That helped 
chop almost five minutes from Chiappucci's lead. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond's cause got some bad news today. His British colleague on the "Z" team, 
Robert Millar, had to give up with an upset stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Millar is the best climber in LeMond's team and had been expected to help his 
leader in Tuesday's crucial 16th stage, a tough 133.6-mile mountain ride in the 
Pyrenees from Blagnac to Luz Ardiden.

"When they lose that much, they don't build up for next time. We're building.

DESIGNER PAUL BOYINGTON: HOLLYWOOD'S MASTER MINIATURIST; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: HIS MOST RECENT CREATION IS THE U.S. -- FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA -- 
FOR THE OPENING SEGMENT OF 'INTO THE NIGHT WITH RICK DEES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAUREN LIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a recent hot day, Paul Boyington took some time out from his work to pose 
for a photo in Hollywood. The logistics of the shot proved to be no easy task. 
It turned out, in fact, that Boyington was too big to fit in Hollywood, so he 
had to settle for a photo of himself somewhere over Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"You mind if I stand here?" the photographer asked, towering over the corner of 
Sunset and Vine. Boyington, equally gargantuan, crouched precariously close to 
Las Vegas to pose near the Hollywood Hills, where a member of his crew 
painstakingly adjusted the white letters of the Hollywood sign. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later the image was recorded on film: Boyington, as Captain of the 
Universe. 
</P>
<P>
A director/designer who combines TV and film visual effects with live action, 
Boyington is certainly the captain of his universe. He specializes in 
constructing miniature landscapes -- as he describes it, "building miniature 
worlds" -- within an ordinary-looking warehouse in Culver City. His work has 
appeared in the TV series "Monsters," "Friday the 13th" and "War of the 
Worlds," the film "Nightmare on Elm Street II" and numerous commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked controlling the world rather than going on location and 
taking what I get," he said, by way of explaining his love for the 
smaller-than-life. 
</P>
<P>
Boyington and his crew were putting the finishing touches on his most recent 
empire, which spread across a 50-foot platform against a twilight studio sky: 
the United States -- complete with fruited plains, purple mountains' majesty 
and shining seas -- but at a fraction of the size. It had been created for the 
opening of ABC's weeknight comedy show "Into the Night With Rick Dees," 
starring the local radio personality, which premieres tonight (midnight on 
Channels 7 and 10, 1 a.m. on Channels 3 and 42). 
</P>
<P>
The opener -- or main title sequence, as it's called -- is a fantasy in which 
Dees, sitting near the window of a small Hollywood office, tosses out a paper 
airplane. "But not any paper airplane," Dees explained in a telephone 
interview. "This one takes on a mind of its own and takes you across America 
every night." 
</P>
<P>
The plane flies out the window, "swoops down on Hollywood, (passes) the Golden 
Gate Bridge in San Francisco, takes a dive down on Texas, goes into overdrive 
in St. Louis through the arch, flies across Middle America, down south, and 
takes a quick turn around Washington," Dees said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end, it goes around the Statue of Liberty, and she reaches down and 
throws the airplane at warp factor seven, and it pierces the universe, which 
crumbles and falls down, exposing the set of 'Into the Night.' The whole ride 
lasts about 30 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
That ride is a journey across Boyington's model, which includes trompe l'oeil 
replicas of well-known landmarks -- such as Seattle's Space Needle and the 
Capitol Records Building in Hollywood. At first, it looks realistic enough to 
fool even the most wide-awake viewer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get a very real look," Boyington said. "I wanted to have the 
viewer buy into the reality at the start of the segment, which gets more 
surreal and whimsical as it goes on." 
</P>
<P>
Surreal touches include scaled-up versions of local or regional symbols. A pair 
of brown cowboy boots is planted smack in the middle of Texas. Boyington's home 
state of Washington is adorned with a normal-sized apple -- relatively huge, 
considering the airplane-throwing Statue of Liberty at the end of the segment 
is a petite 13 inches high. 
</P>
<P>
"His attention to detail is amazing," Dees said. "This is really cutting-edge 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, to make such an idea fly, so to speak, took technological wizardry 
beyond merely constructing a realistic miniature landscape. Boyington also 
oversaw the necessary animation, matting and computer enhancement done by a 
crew of more than 20 free-lance model-makers, designers, cinematographers and 
editors. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to solve problems all the way through, which is what makes this fun," 
Boyington said, citing his most difficult dilemma as having the viewer make the 
seamless transition through the window of Dees' 'office,' filmed on one set and 
in full scale, into the miniature America, another set. 
</P>
<P>
Controlling the path of the airplane after it left Dees' hand actually meant 
filming the plane against a blue background, which on film appears invisible. 
While the airplane remained static, the camera moved according to a computer 
program, making the plane appear to swoop and dip. The same camera motions were 
repeated across the model of America, and the two images were edited together, 
so that the plane seems to fly under the St. Louis Arch and over mountain 
ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the latex-rubber-and-wire Statue of Liberty to grasp and throw the 
airplane was accomplished through stop-motion animation, in which the movement 
of Liberty's arm was photographed frame-by-frame. Played back in real time, 
this kind of animation appears to be one smooth action. 
</P>
<P>
Boyington often mixes different techniques within a single project, and he 
enjoys working with actors as much as with animation and miniatures. "I like to 
combine the best of visual effects with the best of traditional filmmaking," he 
said. "The technology doesn't mean anything if it doesn't enhance the film's 
storytelling."

It's not that we are now doing everything right: It's that we are starting to 
realize that we had been doing everything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Environmental writer Linda Starke 
</P>
<P>
Monitoring the environment is not an upbeat job. 
</P>
<P>
By most indicators, the globe's health continues to deteriorate as forests 
shrink, deserts expand, topsoil erodes, the ozone layer thins and the 
concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases grows. 
</P>
<P>
But the dismal picture has an emerging bright side, and environmental 
consultant Linda Starke has found it. Digging through reports, brochures, 
letters, interviews, proposals and newspaper clippings from around the world, 
she has produced an environmental first: a book for people tired of the bad 
news. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Signs of Hope," her red, white and blue paperback (on recycled paper 
from Oxford University Press) chronicles the disparate steps taken over the 
last three years to save the planet, not destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
The book is a progress report, Starke explains: "I like to say we haven't 
turned the corner yet, but the corner is in sight." 
</P>
<P>
She thinks 1989 was a pivotal year. Citing events that range from the 
international level (the industrial nations' first "green summit") to the local 
level (a small supermarket chain announcing a plan to phase out 
pesticide-treated produce), the book argues that "more things are going right 
than people realize." 
</P>
<P>
"Earth Day gave us a major focus on the importance of individual action," she 
said. "But I think most people are depressed about the global scope -- they 
wonder if personal recycling makes any difference in the big picture. This book 
shows that things are moving in the right direction." The 41-year-old author 
spoke recently from her co-op apartment in Washington where a party had just 
launched the book's distribution in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more optimistic having done this book than I was 10 years ago or five 
years ago," she said. "Now I look for good news and keep it in my files." 
</P>
<P>
Flipping through files, she ticked off newspaper headlines over a three-day 
span: 
</P>
<P>
* "Senator Urges Military Resources Be Turned to Environmental Battle." 
</P>
<P>
* "Power Authority to Offer Conservation Plan" 
</P>
<P>
* "Ninety-Three Nations Agree to Ban Chemicals That Harm Ozone" 
</P>
<P>
* "Suffolk County Adopts Strict Newsprint Recycling Law" 
</P>
<P>
* "Lawn-Care Concern Admits Safety Claims Were Too Low" 
</P>
<P>
Such changes in attitude and action, she maintains, are occurring on enough 
levels to signal that "things are starting to head in a better direction." 
</P>
<P>
That is the trend she has chronicled in her 186-page book, which is receiving 
cautious approval from environmental leaders, who are always wary of false 
complacency. 
</P>
<P>
"She has captured the sense of urgency that has swept through much of the world 
today," said Gus Speth, president of the World Resources Institute. "There are 
some encouraging developments today but still not enough real momentum, 
especially in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
And at Washington's Worldwatch Institute, where Starke was editor for seven 
years of the prestigious "State of the World" reports, President Lester Brown, 
described the book as a "framework in which people can see that what they are 
doing, even on a personal scale, matters." 
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing that there is an ongoing global crisis, he commended Starke: 
"It's an ambitious undertaking and she was well-positioned to do it. She's 
familiar with the material and has done a lot of work gathering together things 
that are happening that no one of us has done -- an update on what's happening 
in the field." 
</P>
<P>
"Signs of Hope" is a sequel, commissioned by the Centre for Our Common Future 
in Geneva, a clearinghouse for the implementation of recommendations in "Our 
Common Future." That was the influential 1987 report of the World Commission on 
Environment and Development, whose members spent three years taking global 
soundings on environmental issues. Commission members met with scientists, 
governmental policy-makers and ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
Their findings, in "Our Common Future," linked economics and the environment to 
lay out a global plan for "sustainable development," briefly defined as 
"meeting the needs of today's generation without borrowing from the future." 
</P>
<P>
"Our Common Future," edited by Starke, was a surprise hit. From its initial 
small press run at Oxford University Press, it is still selling, with an 
estimated half-million copies in print around the world. 
</P>
<P>
On this basis, publisher Thomas Webster decided last summer on a follow-up 
report, to be presented this spring at a United Nations European environmental 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to try for a positive book, to look at things that are moving us in 
a positive direction," Starke said. "The subject was huge, and we were limited 
by time. I was somewhat daunted by the prospects. I didn't have enough time to 
get information on the Third World." 
</P>
<P>
For the bulk of her material, she spent two weeks last November in Geneva at 
the Centre for Our Common Future. Located in the Palais Wilson, a decaying 
neoclassical palace that once housed the League of Nations, the center provides 
a global receiving point for environmental reports. 
</P>
<P>
In a drafty office with 20-foot ceilings and a stunning view of Lake Geneva, 
Starke worked her way through files revealing glimpses of new activity around 
the world as governments, businesses, groups and individuals tackle 
environmental deterioration. In many cases, she noted, "the public is leading 
the leaders." 
</P>
<P>
She took notes on: suspension of commercial logging permits by the Brazilian 
and Thai governments; a comprehensive proposal in Southern California to clean 
up the air; an accord signed in Montreal to halve production of 
ozone-destructive chemicals; an international treaty controlling the movement 
of hazardous wastes; subsidies in Denmark for farmers to convert to organic 
farming; the world's first "carbon tax" on fossil fuels in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
With a ton of research, she holed up in her apartment, with a Toshiba 1200, 
"living on Lean Cuisine and adrenaline," writing her book in two months. 
</P>
<P>
The result falls somewhere between just rattling off a list of "firsts" and 
laying out a comprehensive picture of the world situation today. 
</P>
<P>
Starke, acknowledging the impossibility of a total global picture, describes it 
as "snapshots." 
</P>
<P>
"I have tried to pull together as much as I could of the scattered good news, 
to give people a feeling of movement on the issues," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Starke, who describes herself as a "sociologist who got into the environment," 
grew up in suburban New York and was graduated from Beloit College in Beloit, 
Wis., where reading Paul Ehrlich's book "The Population Bomb" set her on a 
course of global concern. 
</P>
<P>
After five years with Family Planning Associates in London, she joined the 
Worldwatch staff in Washington; in 1981, she became a free-lance 
consultant-editor. She worked with groups such as the Environmental Policy 
Institute, and U.S. Office of Technology Assessment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, she joined the staff of the World Commission on Environment and 
Development for an eight-month stint, where her work on "Our Common Future" led 
to the assignment to write a book accentuating the positive. 
</P>
<P>
This month she is off to Pakistan to edit a conservation report that will be 
submitted to the Pakistani cabinet for consideration as a national policy. 
</P>
<P>
While her immersion in global environmentalism has convinced her that the world 
is finally paying some attention to the state of the Earth, she sees it as only 
a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"All this is good, but not good enough," she writes. "Virtually ignored in all 
this is the urgent need to eliminate world poverty, which is both a cause and 
an effect of environmental degradation. This is just a starting point."

NEW LAWS ENCOURAGE S&amp;LS TO JOIN FEDERAL SYSTEM

<P>
The state Department of Savings and Loan has a life expectancy that is much 
shorter than the institutions it regulates. 
</P>
<P>
 It is funded by fees assessed on thrifts with state charters, and thrifts have 
been fleeing the state system for the federal system since Congress passed the 
thrift industry restructuring measure last year to bail out the S&amp;L deposit 
insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, William D. Davis was appointed by Gov. Deukmejian as commissioner 
of the agency. He replaced his boss, William J. Crawford, who retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis knows he's a short timer. Even if the next governor keeps him on past 
Jan. 1, the department may not last past next July, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-charter system has become a victim not only of the federal law but 
of its own ill-fated effort seven years ago to survive its first brush with 
fate. When Congress pieced together its last major industry deregulation law in 
1982, state-chartered thrifts began converting to federal charters. With 
assessments cut drastically, the state agency reduced its staff to 42 employees 
and faced extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the crisis in 1983, the Legislature enacted the so-called Nolan 
bill, named after its architect, Assemblyman Patrick J. Nolan (R-Los Angeles). 
The law -- one of the most liberal set of banking rules in the nation -- was 
designed to lure back all those who had traded in their California charters for 
federal ones. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. The thrifts came back to the state system, the state agency's 
coffers swelled and its staff tripled in size. It also brought in entrepreneurs 
as thrift magnates, and many of them didn't know what they were doing or abused 
the wide powers the state law had given them. Both federal and state regulators 
seemed powerless to prevent failures, and the industry began to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1985, Crawford and Davis stepped in as state commissioner and chief 
deputy, respectively. After tentative first steps, they became increasingly 
tough on California thrifts, taking action against such rogue operations as 
Ramona Savings &amp; Loan in Orange and North American Savings &amp; Loan in 
Santa Ana before federal regulators could move. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though healthy S&amp;Ls will continue on, possibly as banks, the thrift 
industry's future is clouded at best. The state S&amp;L agency is doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 53, of Villa Park has worked in the industry since 1962. He was an 
executive at Belmont Savings &amp; Loan in Long Beach, which was sold to Great 
Western Savings in 1970, and he was an executive at Mariners Savings &amp; Loan 
in Newport Beach, sold to Fidelity Federal Savings in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The Honolulu native talked recently with Times staff writer James S. Granelli 
about the future of his agency and the fraud and insider abuse that has hurt so 
many thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the latest word on the continued existence of your department? 
</P>
<P>
A. We have just gone through the budget process where there was a difference of 
opinion. The Senate budget subcommittee wanted to give us a $5.5-million budget 
for one year, which was satisfactory and to our liking. The Assembly budget 
subcommittee wanted to give us a six-month budget, which was unsatisfactory. So 
there was this conflict and it went to a conference committee where they hash 
these things out. And just recently, the conference committee agreed on the 
Senate's version. So we do have a one-year budget. We've sent out our 
assessment letter to the state-charter industry. So I think what we have left 
is going to be our base for the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Out of 161 S&amp;Ls still operating in California, how many have state 
charters? 
</P>
<P>
A. We have currently 69 state-chartered savings and loans, out of a high of 156 
in 1985. In the last few days of June before assessments were due, nearly 20 
state charters converted either to federal thrift charters or to state bank 
charters. The number remaining is still far in excess of what we thought we'd 
have. At one point in time, we didn't think we'd have any. The Financial 
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) flatly states that 
no state charter could exceed the authority of the federal charter. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does the state S&amp;L charter carry any advantage now? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are no notable advantages. The advantages for the state system 
disappeared with FIRREA. There are some subtle advantages. I think officers and 
directors liability insurance is cheaper because of the state law, things like 
that. But no real notable advantages. The dual banking system as we have known 
it for the last 140 years, at least as far as California is concerned, is 
fading out. The reason these 69 institutions have elected to stay and pay the 
assessment is because they want to wait one more year to find out if Congress 
is going to make some kind of modification or amendment to FIRREA. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you see Congress revising FIRREA soon? 
</P>
<P>
A. Congress has already said that it will not make any revisions this year. So 
nothing is going to happen until 1991. If you talk to individual House members, 
for example, they will tell you that they like the dual banking system, that 
it's worked well for a long time, that they realize that the concentration of 
regulatory power in Washington isn't desirable for people in California. And 
yet, collectively, they voted to do away with the system. So how the industry 
plans to go back and lobby Congress, I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What needs to be changed in FIRREA? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, nobody has an agenda at this point, other than the obvious things like 
the rule limiting the amount of money that can be loaned to one borrower, which 
makes it difficult for a lot of institutions to get their business done. The 
(U.S.) Office of Thrift Supervision is certainly looking at some flexibility 
with that right now. 
</P>
<P>
Q. These 69 that are hoping, waiting a year, is there anything specific that 
they might be looking for that would keep them in a state system? 
</P>
<P>
A. I haven't heard anything specific. The best example that I can think of 
would be what the state banking industry has. It is insured by Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. and supervised primarily by the state Banking Department, which 
works with FDIC. A state bank has some advantages over a national bank in 
California. For instance, it can put 10% of its assets into direct investments. 
The savings and loans would love to match that, to have a system where FDIC 
would be the insurer and the state Department of Savings &amp; Loan would be 
the primary regulator. Many of them have a conflict with OTS, and they're eager 
to get out from under the supervision of OTS. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you see any possibility that lawmakers may leave some room for a state 
regulatory agency and a state regulatory charter system to exist. 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't hold out much hope that that's going to happen. With the emphasis on 
the savings and loan tragedy -- every day you pick up the newspaper or you see 
on television the aftermath of this tragedy -- I don't see how Congress would 
have the will to make changes that would appear to be softer than what's out 
there right now. But, politics is funny. You think you understand a direction, 
then it changes quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You have taken over as the state's top thrift supervisor, which ought to be 
a personal achievement of sorts, and it sounds more like you're a pall bearer 
at a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
A. That's true. I am presiding over a diminishing entity, and I don't expect 
that will change. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The State Legislature is looking at two bills that would kill or drastically 
change the state-charter system. What's the status of those measures? 
</P>
<P>
A. One bill says that only federal savings and loans should be allowed in 
California, which, in essence, abolishes the department. The other says that 
perhaps we should create a new financial services agency that regulates savings 
and loans, banks, thrift and loans, credit unions and other financial entities. 
Legislative committees decided to put both bills on hold, so there will be no 
activity on them this year. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why are they holding off? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it's more of a wait-and-see approach. A lot of people thought about 
it. They don't like this concentration of power in Washington, where people may 
not be paying as much attention to California's problems as California would. 
Nobody understands our marketplace like we do. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And we had a good example of that recently. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. An excellent example would be the statement made a few months ago by 
FDIC Chairman (L. William) Seidman concerning the prospect of a bad real estate 
market in California. The state banking superintendent responded with his own 
survey that showed the California market being far different than that 
perceived by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Q. At least, you already have a budget for next year. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Our problem really isn't a budgetary problem next year. It's going to 
be more of a problem in maintaining a viable department. We've lost a lot of 
employees, seasoned examiners who are concerned about their careers and had to 
take advantage of offers from other state agencies. So we don't have the human 
resources to do the kind of job we've done in the past. We're going to have to 
retool and take a completely different approach on how we do our job. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kind of approach would that be? 
</P>
<P>
A. What we're doing now, instead of doing these full-blown examinations, is a 
lot of field visits. We have a limited staff -- about 48 from a high of 136 in 
1987. The exams that we do are limited in scope so that we're tightly focused 
on crucial issues -- the major problem assets. We utilize the communication 
lines between our department and OTS and FDIC to help us define what the 
crucial issues are. That, plus our ability to take quick and effective 
enforcement action, allows our department to remain viable even though we're 
doing our job in a little different way. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Regulations and regulators have become tougher -- so tough that builders, 
developers and other regular borrowers complain that they can't get loans 
anymore even though their credit hasn't changed. Are the stiffer criteria that 
lenders have set causing a credit crunch? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't visualize a credit crunch in the foreseeable future, but keep in 
mind that the foreseeable future isn't that far out. I think there are still 
viable projects that will be built and financed. There are a lot that are 
borderline and won't be built now, and they are going to be delayed for a 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you see healthy thrifts shying away from construction or other major 
loans? 
</P>
<P>
A. No, I don't think they're going to shy away from any transaction that is 
solid, not that they always didn't try to make solid deals. But the industry 
still has to create earnings, and to generate the kind of income they need by 
making single-family loans may not quite do it for some of the major savings 
and loans. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The president and the Congress have been escalating the war on thrift fraud. 
How much fraud and insider abuse has there been in the failure of S&amp;Ls in 
California? 
</P>
<P>
A. My guess would be that out of 66 institutions that we've been involved in 
closing, perhaps 25% would be involved in direct outright fraud. A much higher 
percentage would be involved in mismanagement. There's a fine line between 
mismanagement and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Q. With 19 failed thrifts, Orange County has been the home of a 
disproportionate share of the failures in the state. Has it also been home to a 
disproportionate share of the fraud? 
</P>
<P>
A. Perhaps. But I hesitate to say more because there are some institutions at 
which there are prosecutions pending; no indictments have come out, but they're 
in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Only three executives at two failed Orange County thrifts have been indicted 
and convicted of fraud. Does the lack of more indictments indicate anything? 
Lax law enforcement? Difficult cases? 
</P>
<P>
A. All I can say is that it's very frustrating as a regulator to know and 
understand what went on in an institution and then wait for the process to take 
place before you get an indictment and get to trial. I meet with the U.S. 
attorney's office and the FBI and the OTS every month, and we go over a list of 
the pending criminal investigations. There are a number of Orange County 
institutions involved in that. I ask the same questions that you're asking now: 
What is the status? How soon can we expect something? And the answer is really 
that these are very complicated cases. They're difficult to prosecute. They're 
extremely difficult to put into a context that a jury can understand. So it 
takes a lot longer than any of us would expect, and all I can tell you is that 
I am as frustrated with that process as much as anybody is. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If it's so difficult to prove, to present to a jury, does that imply that 
maybe it wasn't fraud but simply greed and mismanagement and stupidity? You 
pointed out that there is a fine line. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes, it is a fine line. I believe that the more sophisticated the 
transaction, the more intent there was to defraud. Some of these transactions 
involve so many different parties, and it's like a big circle. You have a 
starting point and the transaction flows through different companies, 
corporations, partnerships and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Q. With all of the public discussion recently on putting the criminals behind 
bars, are we creating an atmosphere in which the public, as potential jurors, 
would be more inclined to associate an S&amp;L defendant with fraud? 
</P>
<P>
A. My guess is that there would be a greater tendency for public awareness of 
the problems. Whether that would have any effect on jurors, I don't know. But 
there certainly is a far greater awareness today than there was three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is fraud causing S&amp;Ls to fail or is it contributing to losses that 
failing thrifts already had because of bad management, bad loans and the like? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think for the most part, fraud is a contributing factor. It probably, in 
most cases, was not the primary factor. You can't do so many fraudulent deals 
that you drive an institution into the ground. It's always a combination of 
just frivolous, senseless managing and deliberate fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there any institutions that you could point to and say that fraud caused 
the demise? 
</P>
<P>
A. If there is a clear example of that, I'd say it is probably North America 
Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Q. That's the Santa Ana thrift where the late owner and his consultant created 
phony deposit accounts, fake stock certificates and forged documents. The 
consultant, Janet F. McKinzie, was recently convicted of racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
A. Right. We figured that the actual loss caused by fraud amounted to at least 
$40 million.
