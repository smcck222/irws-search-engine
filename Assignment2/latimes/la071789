EXXON VALDEZ MOVES TO CALMER WATERS; MORE TESTS ARE MADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez, still sporadically discharging a substance that U. S. Coast 
Guard and state officials believe is oil, was moved into calmer waters, and 
samples taken from its tanks are being tested to determine their chemical 
makeup, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The crippled tanker was moved to a spot about 15 miles northeast of San 
Clemente Island in response to turbulent seas that had peeled back a sixth 
steel plate from its damaged hull Saturday, Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg said. 
Another plate also might have moved Sunday, but that could not be confirmed, 
Solberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hard to see down there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
High swells over the weekend made it unsafe for divers to inspect the plate 
damage on the underside of the ship, Exxon spokeswoman Jan Cool said, adding 
that on Saturday, swells of 8 to 10 feet battered the ship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noise Has Lessened 
</P>
<P>
The tanker was towed about 30 to 40 miles to the point about 15 miles from 
Pirate Cove near San Clemente Island. Swells on Sunday were reported at 2 to 3 
feet, Solberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the ship reached calmer waters, about 40 miles off the coast, personnel 
on board have reported a significant lessening of noise from the bottom, 
Solberg said, adding that the ship is in no immediate danger. 
</P>
<P>
The hanging plates, at least one of which is protruding about 60 feet from the 
bottom of the hull, must be cut off before the Valdez can clear the San Diego 
Bay bottom, Cool said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard and state agencies are assessing what anchorage area is most 
suitable for the removal, as well as the impact an oil spill could have in such 
an area. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Harbor has been ruled too shallow to allow the repairs, leaving 
Pirate Cove on San Clemente Island the leading candidate for the removal site, 
authorities said. Pirate Cove has a depth of 110 feet, ample room for temporary 
anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, which was towed from Alaska after hitting a reef and dumping 11 
million gallons of crude oil along the Prince William Sound shoreline, was 
scheduled to enter San Diego Bay last Tuesday for a $25-million, nine-month 
repair job at National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., which built the vessel in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel will not be allowed to enter state waters, which extend 3 miles 
offshore, until the results of a laboratory analysis are known, Solberg said. 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard observer on board the Valdez saw a "small burp" of the bluish 
substance streaming from the vessel for about 15 minutes Sunday morning, 
Solberg said. The substance rapidly dissipated and no further emissions were 
reported, Solberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, scientists from the state Department of Fish and Game and Kinnetic 
Laboratories Inc., a Carlsbad firm, were collecting water samples from each of 
the vessel's 16 tanks, said Reed Smith, pollution response coordinator for the 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering process should last until Tuesday, Smith said. The samples will 
be shipped to a private laboratory in Colorado to be analyzed for hydrocarbon 
content and toxicity. The analysis is expected to take four to seven days. 
</P>
<P>
A public protest of the repair plans was scheduled for early today at Fiesta 
Island. Organizers said they expected about 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
The group planned to form a circle with a slash through the middle over the 
word Exxon, spelled out in black plastic letters 30 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that (Exxon is) denying there isn't a slick, there isn't a 
problem," said disc jockey Dan Mitchinson of KKYY-FM, sponsor of the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials have insisted that the Valdez is not leaking oil or harming the 
environment, and Cool said the company is committed to discussing with federal 
and state agencies the procedures to be followed in bringing the ship into 
state waters.

PILOT AND CREW SEE THE COUNTRY IN RECORD TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A string of 48s brought an aviation record to San Diego lawyer Bill Wright. He 
touched down in all 48 contiguous states in his 1948 airplane within 48 hours 
of flying time. 
</P>
<P>
When Wright and two crewmen landed in Pendleton, Ore., last Tuesday, they had 
flown for 44 hours, 35 minutes and 57 seconds over 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 54, owner and pilot of the plane; Michael La France, 32, of San Diego, 
his co-pilot and mechanic, and Eric Presten, 25, of San Jose, a National 
Aeronautics Assn. certified judge, flew around the continental United States in 
a 1948 Luscombe 11-A Silvaire Sedan, the first to set a speed record for the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
In designing the route, Wright chose general-aviation airports at which any 
pilot could land because he wanted to do something other people could repeat. 
</P>
<P>
He used a long-range navigation device called LORAN and other standard 
navigation equipment for the flight, which was made during Learn to Fly Month. 
</P>
<P>
The crew, which took off from Needles on July 1, stayed at some airports for as 
few as 15 minutes, but spent the night at others, resting and waiting for 
better weather, Presten said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started the idea, I wasn't thinking of setting a record, but some 
guys at the National Aeronautics Assn. encouraged me to get into it," Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The three men flew at an average speed of 130 m.p.h., beating their goal of 
making the trip in 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
La France, who owns a smaller two-seat 1949 Luscombe, said that although he had 
little mechanical work to do on the airplane during the trip, the flying was 
intense. 
</P>
<P>
"It really called on all my aviation experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wright and La France said the '48 Luscombe is fairly easy to fly because 
the 92 produced were designed with businessmen and families in mind. In fact, 
the inside of Wright's plane looks a lot like a car because the parts come from 
automobile manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The original upholstery, ashtrays and dome lights were purchased from Cadillac, 
and the panel incorporates prewar Studebaker and Stewart-Warner parts. The 
3,700-square-inch window space also resembles that of a car, with its rear 
windows and overhead skylights.

DRASTIC CHANGES UNLIKELY IN WAKE OF BAJA ELECTION UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MEXICALI, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much has been made of the "historic" nature of the opposition victory in the 
Baja California gubernatorial, state and local elections of July 2. 
</P>
<P>
"This electoral process marks a parting of the waters in the democratic life of 
the country," declared Arturo Guerra Flores, Baja's secretary general of 
government and former state president of the long-dominant Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
Both the national and international press have hammered away at the theme, 
bestowing plaudits on Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who sits 
atop the PRI hierarchy, for "allowing" the victory by Governor-elect Ernesto 
Ruffo Appel, the candidate of the opposition National Action Party, or PAN. In 
results finally confirmed last week after a tedious count, Ruffo handily 
defeated Margarita Ortega Villa, the federal senator who was the PRI candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his scheduled inauguration Nov. 1, Ruffo will become the first opposition 
governor in modern Mexican history, and, in another precedent-setting 
development, will be working with a state legislature in which the PRI is the 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Watershed Election 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no question that Ruffo's ascension to the governorship is a 
watershed for Mexico and Baja California, most independent analysts agree that 
life and government will not change drastically in this fast-growing border 
state, now home to an estimated 3 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by PAN pronouncements to date and the results in municipalities where 
PAN has captured mayoral seats, observers say that the new Baja governor will 
probably lead anti-corruption and pro-efficiency campaigns, purge PRI leaders 
from senior positions, and encourage stability, investment and a strong 
private-sector presence in government. Many PRI loyalists traditionally 
rewarded with no-show jobs will undoubtedly lose their principal sources of 
income. And PRI-affiliated contractors and concessionaires, from taxi drivers 
to water-truck deliverers, may find that their former monopolies face new 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
And there may be some high-profile revelations, notably in the 1988 murder of a 
well-known Tijuana journalist, Hector Felix Miranda -- a case that Ruffo has 
publicly promised to investigate thoroughly. For the first time, PAN appointees 
will head the state police, judiciary and Tijuana police. (PAN also won the 
mayoralty of Tijuana for the first time.) 
</P>
<P>
But dramatic departures in governance appear unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Symbolic Factor 
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important difference will be the symbolism," said Tonatiuh 
Guillen Lopez, a political scientist who directs the department of public 
administration at the College of the Northern Frontier, a Tijuana-based 
research institution. "We are definitely entering a distinct period in the 
history of our country. . . . But I don't expect radical or spectacular 
changes. There will be an effort to increase efficiency, to demand honesty and 
respect of the law in government." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, the nation -- and the world -- will be watching. For Baja 
California has become the paramount laboratory for the political opening and 
modernization proclaimed by President Salinas. It is also the foremost 
opportunity for PAN, for half a century the perpetual bridesmaid in Mexican 
politics, to show that it can wear the ring of authority. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now really going to learn a lot about whether PAN can be really trusted 
to run a government," said Gabriel Szekely, associate director for the UC San 
Diego Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies. "Baja California will be a showcase for 
the PAN, and it's in their interest to do the best that they can." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about their plans, PAN leaders, many of whom have close ties to U.S. 
investors, talk much about Republican Party-style economic policies -- they 
favor increased foreign investment in Mexico, a greater nexus between the 
private and public sectors, volunteerism and the like. But PAN's conservative 
economic orientation, once widely divergent from the mainstream, is now much in 
line with recent policies enunciated by the PRI presidency in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Investment 
</P>
<P>
The PRI's former public distaste for some foreign-investment schemes, such as 
the booming assembly-plant industries along the U. S. border, has diminished 
considerably in recent years as financial planners have sought some way out of 
the nation's economic quagmire. The government has embraced the assembly plants 
and virtually any other form of foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, major changes in economic policy seem unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
That prognosis may have been different had the governor's seat been captured by 
the left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution, which is led by 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRI defector who was almost elected president last 
year. (Baja was one of a handful of states won outright by Cardenas.) 
</P>
<P>
Although Salinas was apparently willing to lose Baja to the right, observers 
say that concurrent election results from the interior state of Michoacan, the 
home state of Cardenas, demonstrate that he was not about to concede that state 
to a leftist opposition that has quite contrary ideas about how to solve the 
country's economic woes. The PRI has claimed a disputed victory in electoral 
results there. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a clear double standard," said Lorenzo Meyer, a well-known political 
scientist affiliated with El Colegio de Mexico, a Mexico City-based research 
institution. "We have an advance in Baja California, but evidence of the old 
politics in Michoacan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear of Strangulation 
</P>
<P>
On the financial front, there has been some fear that the PRI-dominated central 
government in Mexico City, source of most state funding, might try to strangle 
an opposition regime by reducing the flow of federal cash, thus making a PAN 
regime appear in its worst light. In fact, PRI state governments in the past 
have withheld funds from city halls run by a number of opposition mayors, 
including Ruffo when he sat as mayor of Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is widespread belief that the national PRI leadership and 
President Salinas recognize that it would be counterproductive to attempt to 
strangle an economically booming border state such as Baja California, which 
boasts something that few areas of Mexico can now claim: A vibrant economy, 
thanks largely to tourism, international trade and the assembly-plant industry. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from hurting Salinas' reformist image, Szekely noted that taking fiscal 
action against Baja California "would just be sending the wrong signals to 
foreign investors. I don't think Salinas will do that. I think he will use Baja 
as an experiment for cohabitation with the PAN." 
</P>
<P>
During his campaign, Ruffo also doubted that the central government would seek 
to straitjacket a PAN-led state. "Baja California is too important economically 
to the entire country for the PRI to attempt to make it difficult for us," the 
PAN candidate said in an interview shortly before election day. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign and post-election period, Ruffo has been largely 
conciliatory toward the Mexican president, going out of his way to thank 
Salinas for ensuring a democratic transformation in Baja California. Ruffo did 
this even while condemning clumsy attempts at fraud by local PRI apparatchiks 
eager to rig the election in favor of the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Peace With PRI 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo's olive branches offered to the president are seen as a portent. 
Stridency has never been part of his political style, even while he was a 
beleaguered mayor of an almost-bankrupt Ensenada, under vicious attack from 
PRI-dominated local unions that accused him of incompetence. As governor, Ruffo 
must rely on assistance from Mexico City, as well as cooperation from PRI 
elements within the state, to allow government to run smoothly -- a precept 
that PAN leaders consider critical. There has even been talk that Ruffo might 
place a PRI official in his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing Ruffo has to do is conciliate," said one PRI insider here. "It 
doesn't do him any good to have conflict within the state while he's governor." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, PRI leaders themselves have been speaking of the need for tranquility 
in the state, both during and after the elections. Interim Gov. Oscar Baylon 
Chacon has called for an orderly transition of government. No one wants 
tourists and investors, the area's lifeblood, frightened away by reports of 
disruptions or violence. 
</P>
<P>
Among those most resistant to change, and with the most to lose, are the many 
PRI loyalists who have for years existed off the public trough, finding a 
comfortable new position with each state government. The PRI, like political 
machines elsewhere, has long functioned as a massive patronage dispenser, and, 
with each new administration, functionaries in search of "bones," or jobs, have 
traditionally paid their homage to the new governors and mayors. No-show 
employees are known as "aviators," because they are seldom seen after their 
quick landings to pick up their checks or make ceremonial appearances at their 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No One Behind the Door 
</P>
<P>
"The party has always been there for them when they came knocking at its door," 
said a longtime PRI insider, who declined to be identified. "But no more." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the PRI will continue to be a large presence here, subsidized as 
always from Mexico City. And the party will still be able to dole out jobs 
within its own apparatus as well as within the many grass-roots organizations, 
unions and concessions that it controls. But party leaders have acknowledged 
that some changes are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to seek good from this adversity, and we'll accomplish this when we 
recognize our errors and mistakes and eliminate them," Rene Trevino Arredondo, 
a long-time PRI leader, ex-mayor of Tijuana and current federal congressman, 
said in an interview last week with the daily El Mexicano. 
</P>
<P>
As governor, meantime, Ruffo will have to rely on the cooperation of at least 
some of the many PRI loyalists among the 5,000 or so state employees. Although 
he may replace high-ranking department heads, the experience and know-how of 
middle-level bureaucrats will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the PAN itself will have to ensure that it doesn't fall prey to the 
same tendencies -- cronyism, corruption and bureaucratic paralysis -- that have 
turned so many Mexican citizens against the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
The precise program of PAN leaders in Baja remains murky, but one specific goal 
is clear: A reform of state electoral laws to allow minority parties more 
opportunity to challenge the PRI monolith. As now drafted, the state's 
complicated election statutes favor the ruling party in many ways, allowing PRI 
manipulations at many stages in the process. PAN leaders charged that the 
tortuous delays in releasing official election results were yet another example 
of ruling-party shenanigans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Party With Majority 
</P>
<P>
Pushing through reforms may not be as easy as PAN loyalists would like, 
however. No party, it appears, will have a majority in the new, 19-member state 
legislature that convenes in October. PAN is now slated to have eight seats, 
the PRI seven, and minority parties four others, although those numbers could 
change as the Electoral College, now dominated by PAN, hears complaints 
surrounding a disputed PRI victory in Mexicali's 3rd Electoral District. 
Whatever happens, though, both the PAN and the PRI will have to seek alliances 
from third parties, all on the left of the political spectrum, far from the PAN 
ideology. 
</P>
<P>
For PRI lawmakers, such negotiation will be a learning experience, as the party 
has never before been in the minority. But new skills will be needed most 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We're entering an experimental time, something completely new for the 
country," concluded Guillen, the Tijuana political scientist. "By watching what 
happens here, maybe we can anticipate the future direction of the nation."

76TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT CANDIDATES OUTLINE POSITIONS, PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are brief sketches of the 76th Assembly District candidates and their 
campaigns: 
</P>
<P>
* Dick Lyles , a 42-year-old management consultant and longtime Republican 
activist, entered the special 76th District race widely viewed as the candidate 
to beat, a tribute to nearly four years of on-and-off planning that began in 
1985 when Bill Bradley discovered that he had cancer and announced his 
intention to retire. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's subsequent decisions to seek reelection in 1986 and 1988 prompted 
Lyles to twice postpone his campaign-in-waiting. Those plans, as well as later 
groundwork for a possible 1990 race, were made, Lyles insists, with Bradley's 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Bradley's inner circle, however, dispute that contention, and have 
sought to transform what they regard as Lyles' callous advance work into a 
major campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to quell the controversy, Lyles dismisses the criticism as sniping from 
political opponents and attributes the issue's emergence primarily to the 
flame-fanning efforts of former Bradley consultant Herb Williams, who now is 
working for rival Linda Brannon. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Lyles' early start gave him a significant organizational edge over 
his opponents, and his past work on other GOP candidates' races left him 
valuable IOUs that helped attract endorsements and financial contributions from 
San Diego, Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-year Poway resident whose consulting work involves numerous 
international companies, Lyles has built his campaign around the slogan "An 
Opportunity for Excellence." Expanding upon that theme -- albeit with 
generalities -- at a recent candidates forum, Lyles said: "I'm a problem 
solver. But I'm not running merely to be a problem solver. I'd like to present 
a vision for California and for this district." 
</P>
<P>
* Linda Brannon , who has served on the Poway City Council for the past 2 1/2 
years, also has drawn her fair share of endorsements from local legislators, 
but attracted more attention for the endorsements that she did not receive when 
a majority of her council colleagues backed Lyles. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the significance of that episode, the 42-year-old Brannon 
characterizes Lyles' endorsements as little more than "political pay-backs" 
while arguing that her own support stems from approval of her activity in 
regional anti-drug abuse, youth and transportation programs. 
</P>
<P>
Running under her "People Come First" slogan, Brannon uses her standard stump 
speech to remind voters that she is the only candidate with experience in 
elective public office. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a proven track record," she says. "I'm the only candidate who's been 
actively working to solve the problems and concerns of the district." 
</P>
<P>
* Tricia Hunter , the director of surgical services at Chula Vista's Community 
Hospital, has been working hard to combat the perception fostered by Lyles and 
Brannon that, as she put it, "this is only a two-candidate race." 
</P>
<P>
"They'd like to have people think of the election that way," said Hunter, 
president of the state nursing board, a body to which she was appointed by Gov. 
George Deukmejian in 1983. "But they're going to be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to find a niche in the crowded field, Hunter, 37, points to her seven 
years of "state-level experience" and positions on several key issues as 
factors that distinguish her from the pack -- specifically, from Brannon and 
Lyles. Of the three, Hunter is the only one who supports the Legislature's 
recently approved ban on the sale of assault rifles and who is pro-choice on 
the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other candidates, however, Hunter concedes that issue-oriented 
differences probably will play a relatively minor role in the election, saying 
that there are too many candidates and too little time for an already-passive 
public to focus on ideological distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
* In a race in which the name of Bill Bradley is dropped often, no one does so 
more frequently than Dennis Koolhaas , who has tried to position himself as the 
candidate best able to complete not only the late assemblyman's unfinished 
term, but also his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
His top priority if elected, Koolhaas said, would be to "finish off what Mr. 
Bradley started" by pushing for adoption of his bills and other policy goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the first to say that, but now the others are starting to pick up on 
it," said Koolhaas, a former dairy farmer who for the past four years has been 
a field representative for state Sen. Bill Craven (R-Oceanside). 
</P>
<P>
Koolhaas, who has taken a leave from Craven's staff to campaign, has made his 
experience in that job the cornerstone of his race. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working with legislators in Sacramento every day," Koolhaas said. "I 
know the people, I know the conditions. He who knows the business the best does 
the best. I won't have to waste time learning the job." 
</P>
<P>
* Bill Hoover , a 21-year San Diego policeman, is one of three candidates in 
the race who has sought elective public office before (Brannon and Richardson 
being the others), having lost a 1986 race to state Sen. Wadie Deddeh (D-Chula 
Vista). 
</P>
<P>
Although Hoover was defeated more than 2 to 1 in the vote count, he regards the 
race as a plus in his current campaign, noting that the 76th District overlaps 
with Deddeh's state senatorial district -- leaving him, he hopes, with some 
residual name identification. Hoover also was county co-chairman of TV 
evangelist Pat Robertson's 1988 presidential campaign and heads a local group 
that last year sponsored a fund-raising tribute to Lt. Col. Oliver North. 
</P>
<P>
Currently the Police Department's special events coordinator, Hoover, 45, cites 
his police background as the singular feature of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Having personally dealt with the problems on the streets, I have ideas about 
what needs to be done that come from experience," said Hoover, who advocates 
less judicial discretion in sentencing criminals. "How many of the other people 
running really would be any different from what you already have up in 
Sacramento?" 
</P>
<P>
* Narrowly defeated in a 1980 race for the Palm Desert City Council,Glenn 
Richardson admits that his last-minute entry in the 76th District campaign left 
him with "ground to make up" in catching the front runners.

"Some people have been dancing on Bill Bradley's grave for years," said 
Richardson, 41. "In terms of cranking things up, those of us who were loyal to 
Bill started out a little behind the eight ball." His position as the only 
Riverside County candidate, Richardson hopes, could help offset that 
disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
A former Coachella Valley stockbroker and for eight years a financial analyst 
on desert-area television stations, Richardson also served on a 1987-88 
gubernatorial commission that studied the possible economic impact of a 
proposed regional government in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
* As a Democrat running in a heavily Republican district,Jeannine Correia 
acknowledges that she entered the race with low expectations, seeking only to 
ensure that there was "a qualified Democrat on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
Although the splintered GOP field gives her at least a glimmer of hope, a 
victory either by Correia or fellow Democrat Stephen Thorne would be an upset 
of major proportions. Both estimate that they probably will spend about $10,000 
in their respective campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Undeterred by her slim prospects, Correia, a 46-year-old instructor with the 
Assn. for Retarded Citizens, has been crisscrossing the district and last week 
spent several days in Sacramento trying to line up support. The organizational 
groundwork laid by her campaign, she said, could enhance the party's future 
efforts, "even if it doesn't produce a win this time." 
</P>
<P>
* Facing the same obstacles as Correia,Stephen Thorne , 34, said he views the 
campaign as a platform for his policy positions -- in particular, for his 
strong pro-choice stance on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"What I want to do is say, 'Here's what I have to say,' and hope that people 
pay attention to it," said Thorne, who regularly escorts women "through the 
gauntlet of protesters" at abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The director of the San Diego chapter of American Atheists -- a group that 
unsuccessfully sought to force local officials to remove the massive cross atop 
Mt. Soledad in La Jolla -- Thorne recognizes that his atheism may make even 
some fellow Democrats reluctant to embrace his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not running as an atheist," said Thorne, a county mental health worker 
since 1985. "I'm running as a Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
* With San Diego County ranking 57th out of the state's 58 counties in terms of 
per-capita state funding, all of the candidates consistently pledge to try to 
find ways to reverse that longstanding trend. Spring Valley retiree Ray Foster 
, however, argues that he is the only one with a guaranteed method of drawing 
attention to that problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If you elect me, I'll be on top of that desk yelling, and I won't stop," the 
69-year-old Foster said. "Put me up there and I'll be photographed on top of 
that desk, I promise you!" 
</P>
<P>
A longtime political activist, Foster heads a citizens group that fought to 
prevent the San Diego Convention Center from being named after the Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr., and also is president of HOSTAGE, a mobile-home lobbying 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one thing you know you're getting with me, and that's a flamboyant 
guy," Foster said. "If I'm up there, it won't be business as usual."

CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I want to compliment you on your editorial of June 26. 
</P>
<P>
For many years I have been on the Metropolitan Water District Board, 
representing the San Gabriel Valley, and from 1975 to 1979 I was chairman of 
the board during the last serious drought. During and since water leaders have 
worked hard and long to pass the Peripheral Canal Bill or similar legislation 
to get more water to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years later the problem is still not solved. 
</P>
<P>
Three things must happen to solve the persistent water problem for California. 
Water must be transported to where the growth is happening; agriculture must be 
sustained as it is the biggest industry in California; and our precious 
environment must be preserved for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
All three can be done by sincere people working together.

FLAG-BURNING AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A constitutional amendment is not necessary to curb flag burning. A natural 
deterrent already exists. Now that the people know that the laws and courts are 
unable to protect them from the lunatic fringe, they will take matters into 
their own hands with an exercise in civil disobedience. After a little pushing 
and shoving around, the police will arrive and arrest the flag burners for 
inciting a riot.

DEUKMEJIAN GETS ON BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pending negotiations on health insurance between Gov. George Deukmejian and 
leaders of the Legislature are, in effect, the last opportunity for Sacramento 
to address a problem too long neglected. A growing coalition of Californians is 
ready with an expansive and constructive initiative for the November, 1990, 
general election if they fail. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has moved into the controversy in the face of two pieces of 
legislation that offer complementary corrections of the failure in the state to 
provide any form of health insurance to an estimated 5 million persons. The 
governor must also feel a mounting pressure for him to assume some leadership 
on health issues after the understandably harsh criticism of his budget vetoes 
of public-health and mental-health funding for the 1989-90 budget year. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem has been created by the negativism of the California 
Chamber of Commerce and the passivity of the California Business Roundtable, in 
contrast to other parts of the country where business leaders are seeking 
solutions to the problem. The failure of California businessmen to respond is 
even more perplexing given the evidence that it is they, through payroll-funded 
health insurance, who must pick up more and more of the cost of the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly has now approved two useful bills, AB 350, sponsored by Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and AB 328, by Assemblyman Burt Margolin 
(D-Los Angeles). Brown's bill would mandate employer-funded health insurance, 
which would extend coverage to half or more of those not now covered. 
Margolin's bill is broader, creating a state insurance plan to underwrite 
subsidized state insurance for lower-income persons and assure universal 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin's bill is, in general, a preview of an initiative being drafted by the 
Health Access Foundation. The growing coalition now includes many major 
health-consumer groups. The California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems is 
actively participating and the California Medical Assn., while basically 
supporting the Brown bill, is also joining the talks. Most conspicuous by its 
absence from the consultations is the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
We have no doubt that a legislative remedy is preferable to traveling the 
initiative route. But we are also convinced that the patience of Californians 
is running out. The coalition working on an initiative has the breadth and 
sense of responsibility to offer a useful alternative if the governor and the 
Legislature once again fail to produce.

SAFE TO WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be considerable debate in the U.S. Senate soon over the level of oil 
imports. But once the rhetoric is over, senators can vote with a clear 
conscience for a one-year moratorium on oil exploration and production in the 
outer continental shelf, including the entire California coast. 
</P>
<P>
Imports are of concern. The United States does need to be more self-sufficient 
in energy. But a year's delay in the offshore oil-leasing program will have no 
significant effect on long-term U.S. energy security. 
</P>
<P>
The House-approved moratorium obviously comes in reaction to the Exxon Valdez 
accident in Alaska in March and more recent tanker spills in the East. Critics 
claim the legislation is overkill, since offshore oil production does not 
necessarily lead to tanker spills. But oil in the water is oil in the water. 
The year's delay may finally force Congress and the Administration to honestly 
weigh the benefits of offshore oil production against the liabilities within 
the context of a real energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement may give the President's offshore oil task force more latitude 
in assessing the amount of available oil along the California and Alaskan 
coasts against the environmental risks. There will be more time to consider 
replacing dirty oil with cleaner-burning natural gas. Officials can factor in 
the oil savings from the use of alternative fuels in autos, as proposed in the 
President's amendments to the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
A year's thoughtful delay is nothing compared with the non-achievement of James 
G. Watt and successive secretaries of the interior the past eight years. They 
had gloated that Jimmy Carter's energy program never produced a drop of oil. 
But for all of Watt &amp; Co.'s zeal to accelerate and expand the offshore oil 
program, while brushing aside legitimate environmental complaints, they didn't 
produce any more oil, either.

WHEN FLAG WAS REALLY UNDER FIRE, IT WAS LINCOLN WHO STOOD TALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR H. PURCELL, Arthur H. Purcell, formerly a resident of Washington, is 
an environmental engineer at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our nation's capital swelters in unforgiving damp heat this time of year, with 
no ocean breeze or low humidity to temper the weather. Even to someone wearing 
shorts and a T-shirt, Washington can be unbearable in mid-July. Which makes the 
thought of fighting a war in this heat, dressed in full wool uniform and 
carrying heavy equipment, overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
But that is exactly what happened 125 years ago this month at the battle of Ft. 
Stevens, when a nearly defenseless capital city came close to a Confederate 
takeover. At the height of that battle, a President would do what no other has 
ever done -- stand beside his troops as the enemy fired and tried to move in. 
</P>
<P>
It was a muggy Saturday. Jubal T. Early, the crafty Southern general who had 
long frustrated Union troops with his guile, had decided to take a big gamble: 
Attack Washington from the north, push into the heart of the city and rout 
Abraham Lincoln from the White House. As Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg would 
later note, Gen. Early had "marched his men on the Seventh Street Road that 
would lead him straight to the offices, arsenals, gold and silver of the United 
States government." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all able-bodied Union soldiers had been sent south, to join Ulysses 
S. Grant's campaign on Richmond. Raw recruits, older men and wounded just out 
of the hospital had been assigned to the capital's defenses. Unbeknownst to 
Lincoln, his Navy secretary had a steamer on the Potomac waiting to evacuate 
him from Washington. Telegraph lines had been cut and Washington was isolated. 
Washingtonians were fleeing the city by the wagonload -- ironically, heading 
north into Early's territory. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Ft. Stevens began after sunrise and the fighting was fierce. By 
afternoon the Union commander-in-chief was there in person to rally his troops 
and watch the swaying skirmish lines of blue and gray. Standing on a parapet 
facing the onslaught, the tall onlooker in stovepipe hat must have been an 
inviting target to the Confederates. An officer three feet away from Lincoln 
was shot down. Another was hit. But the President stood placidly, "with grave 
and passive countenance" according to his aides. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln was eventually persuaded by the commanding general to get down below, 
but only after the President had ascertained that his troops would prevail and 
the capital would stay in Union hands. It had been a stunning moment of courage 
and compassion by a chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Ft. Stevens today sits in a quiet, run-down neighborhood six miles north of the 
White House. The raised wall of earth that Lincoln walked across to reach his 
vantage point is still intact. A mounted rider patrols the grassy area, lending 
an almost timeless air to the battleground. A few blocks past Ft. Stevens, 
wedged between two aging structures, is a diminutive national cemetery holding 
the remains of men who fell in defense of Ft. Stevens. A little farther up the 
road, in a suburban churchyard, lie Confederates who were stopped at Ft. 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the countless visitors to Washington each year stop by these sites. But 
those who do experience something special. For it is here that the nation came 
close to changing direction. And it is here that a leader set an example for 
generations to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as passions are unleashed over the burning of one flag, it is important 
to remember someone who stood tall when the flag was truly under fire.

SOVIET APPROACH TO IRAN OUTRUNS COMPLACENT WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIREEN T. HUNTER, Shireen T. Hunter is a deputy director of the Middle East 
project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Hashemi Rafsanjani, visited the 
Soviet Union last month, it was no mere diplomatic formality; it was a critical 
turning point in the long, often turbulent, history of Russo-Persian relations. 
This was underscored when he stopped in Baku, capital of Soviet Azerbaijan, and 
preached during the Friday prayer service at the city's largest mosque. Not 
since the separation of that area from Persia in 1828 had such a senior Tehran 
official visited Baku. 
</P>
<P>
If fully implemented, the agreements reached during Rafsanjani's visit will 
organically link Iran's economy to that of the Soviet Union, greatly increasing 
Soviet political leverage and Iran's dependence. Why would Rafsanjani take such 
a path? And why was he given the red-carpet treatment, which the Soviets knew 
would displease both the West and the Arab world? 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the dominant Western view, strong pro-Soviet tendencies exist 
within Iran and its leadership. The Soviet Union has infiltrated Iran's 
bureaucracy, the Revolutionary Guards and the intelligence services. Its 
proximity and its links with Iran's minorities and opposition groups also give 
it the ability to reward and punish Iran and thereby manipulate Iranian 
behavior. And recent changes in Soviet rhetoric -- if not in policy -- have 
diminished Iran's perception of threat from the Soviet Union and made it appear 
an attractive partner. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, after the cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war last August, the effort by 
Iran's leadership to open up to the West met strong criticism in the Iranian 
press by proponents of better ties between the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc 
countries. Rafsanjani's adoption of a pro-Soviet foreign policy and his 
professed admiration for Mikhail S. Gorbachev may be part of a domestic 
political bargain that will allow him to run for the presidency without serious 
opposition. His trip to Moscow, along with his earlier statement that 
Palestinians are entitled to kill Westerners in retaliation for Israeli 
actions, were tests posed by the radicals to see whether he has shed his 
pro-Western tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian proponents of improved ties with the West have despaired that it will 
ever consider Iran's grievances sympathetically. After the cease-fire, for 
example, many Iranians hoped that the West would chastise Iraq for the massive 
use of chemical weapons and would help achieve full implementation of the U.N. 
Security Council resolution that outlines steps for a negotiated peace. They 
were disappointed on both scores. Admittedly, the West had to contend with the 
continued holding of hostages in Lebanon, but its lack of response to Iranian 
expectations undermined pro-West elements in Iran and their ability to mitigate 
the hostage issue. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the West deepened Iranian disillusionment by joining with 
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in attempting to exclude both Iran and Iran-based 
moujahedeen from arrangements for Afghanistan's political future. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, since the cease-fire the Soviet Union has acknowledged past 
mistakes in its dealings with Iran and has vowed to remedy them. It has called 
for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Iranian territory, and it has supported 
the 1975 Algiers Agreement as a basis for resolving the dispute over the Shatt 
al Arab waterway. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow also has acknowledged that Iran is a pivotal country in the Middle East 
and should play an important role in regional politics. Indeed, the policy 
adopted by the West and its regional allies of excluding Iran from an Afghan 
settlement has created a common strategic interest between Tehran and Moscow. 
Also, the Soviets' problems in the Caucasus and in Central Asia have increased 
Iran's value. Given its extensive links with these areas, a friendly Iran can 
be helpful to the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, Iran's improved access to these 
republics will help it to counter Saudi Arabia and its extensive Wahabi 
proselytizing in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have no doubt concluded that, for the foreseeable future, they 
stand no chance of replacing U.S. influence in the Gulf Arab states or in 
Egypt. Thus, gaining decisive influence with Iran would be worth the sacrifice 
of uncertain prospects with the Arabs -- if in fact that would be the result. 
Improved Soviet-Iranian ties might simply induce the Gulf Arabs to improve 
their own relations with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
This pattern of developments refutes the view, popular in the West, that the 
Soviet Union and Iran are merely in a new "on" stage of their old off-and-on 
relationship. Or that Rafsanjani's visit was a ploy to protect his political 
flank before pursuing a pro-Western policy. Significant elements in Iran, 
backed by Soviet support, will ensure that this does not happen. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, some Western commentators argue that, in the post-Cold War era, 
Iran is no longer important and can be ceded to the Soviets without loss. This 
is a short-sighted view of Iran's intrinsic strategic importance in the region, 
with or without a cold war. By contrast, any serious, historical view calls for 
an end to the policy of drift and complacency. That does not mean engaging in a 
bidding contest with the Soviets for Iranian allegiance. But it does require 
serious efforts to put relations with Iran back on a more reasonable basis 
where, over time, it will see that it has some alternative to a deeper 
dependence on Moscow.

FIRE DOES $500,000 DAMAGE TO BRIDGE; 3 BOYS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three youths are believed to have ignited a fire Saturday afternoon that caused 
about $500,000 damage to a bridge and roadway in San Marcos, authorities said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, boys ranging in age from 10 to 13, were arrested Saturday by 
sheriff's arson investigators on suspicion of starting an unlawful fire, 
according to Sgt. Julie Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses saw three young boys running from the area where a bridge on Valpreda 
Road near Mission Road was engulfed in flames, Sutton said. Sheriff's 
investigators found a large gasoline can near the fire's origin underneath the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The boys told authorities that they emptied the can into a stream running 
underneath the bridge, Sutton said. One of the boys ignited the gasoline and 
the bridge, which was made of a combination of asphalt and timber, immediately 
caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It put out a pretty good column of smoke," said San Marcos Fire Capt. Michael 
Marks. No one was injured in the blaze and no vehicles were damaged, Marks 
said. The bridge, about 25 to 30-feet, is closed to traffic pending a 
structural analysis, Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
The boys were taken to the sheriff's substation in Vista and later released 
into the custody of their parents, Sutton said.

The carnival rides and games, concerts and alcoholic beverages were gone from 
the San Fernando Valley Fair this year -- sacrificed by the fair board so it 
could stage the event at Hansen Dam after losing the fair's previous site. 
</P>
<P>
But fair-goers on Sunday, the last day of the event in Lake View Terrace, 
didn't seem to mind. Mostly parents and grandparents, they were happy to show 
their children the traditional staples of American fairs -- livestock, 
agricultural products and home crafts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having a great time," said Kurt Caldwell, 29, of Sunland, who attended 
the fair with his wife and his son Cian, 4. "We're vegetarians and it is good 
for him to see the animals that he knows other people eat." 
</P>
<P>
Fair attendance has declined dramatically with the absence of carnival 
attractions. Last year, 70,000 people attended a 4 1/2-day event which featured 
nighttime concerts, said fair organizer Ted Nauman. He refused to release 
attendance figures Sunday for the first two days of this year's three-day 
event, but said he expects overall paid attendance will exceed 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Nauman said he "couldn't be happier" with the reduced fair, despite the smaller 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
The fair's primary purpose is to preserve the farming and ranching heritage of 
the Valley, which was once an important goat-ranching area and the nation's 
leading producer of lettuce, he said. The carnival attractions didn't 
contribute to that, Nauman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only opportunity a lot of urban dwellers have to explore the 
relationship of the family to the farm, to see the values of hard work and 
enterprise demonstrated," Nauman said. 
</P>
<P>
Standing next to the three steers his daughters sold Saturday, Earl Ritchie, 
68, of Reseda, said the most pressing problem facing the fair is finding a 
permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the fair was ousted from Cal State Northridge after 13 years to make 
way for campus development. In late April the fair's governing board agreed to 
hold a scaled-down version at Hansen Dam. 
</P>
<P>
Ritchie, whose family has entered the fair for the last 15 years, said 
potential exhibitors were dissuaded from raising animals this year because they 
were not sure they would have a place to sell livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Many entrants are students who raise animals as part of school agricultural 
programs. Others raise animals on their own land. 
</P>
<P>
Ritchie said he started his four daughters, now 23, 20, 18, and 17, raising 
lambs and pigs when they were younger than 10.

<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department arrested 94 alleged gang members this weekend 
in its fourth and reportedly "best" anti-gang sweep in the San Fernando Valley, 
a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The law-enforcement effort, known as Operation Hammer and involving about 146 
officers, began Friday night with 131 arrests -- 48 of which involved alleged 
gang members. Another 136 arrests were made between Saturday night and early 
Sunday, including 46 alleged gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the four previous task forces, this was the best," Sgt. John Staugaard said

POLITICS HAS LANGUAGE OF ITS OWN IN MEXICO 
</P>

MEXICALI, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As official results from the July 2 Baja California elections dribbled in at a 
desultory pace last week, opposition leaders accused the ruling party of 
deliberately employing dilatory tactics to prolong the process. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly deliberate tortuguismo," charged a spokesman for the National 
Action Party, or PAN, using a word that translates literally as "turtleism," or 
deliberate foot-dragging. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's peculiar political universe has developed its own vocabulary, and many 
of the most intriguing phrases have been on display in Baja in recent weeks 
during one of the nation's most-contested and liveliest elections. 
</P>
<P>
Words such as tortuguismo are often employed in non-electoral contexts, but 
such expressions take on special meaning in Mexico at ballot time, when 
linguistic cunning is at a premium. Nowhere is that more evident than in 
discussing electoral fraud, for such activity is a highly specialized field 
here. 
</P>
<P>
One example: Traditionally, ruling party loyalists from the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, have arrived at the ballot boxes 
carrying so-called tacos -- numerous ballots, premarked in favor of PRI 
candidates, that are rolled up in the form of the tasty Mexican treat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Magicians of the Election 
</P>
<P>
Fraud is broadly known at election time as alquimia, or alchemy, and its 
practitioners revered as alquimistas (alchemists), magos (magicians) or 
artistas (artists). Theirs is the power to turn defeats into lopsided 
victories, inflating registration lists with multiple names and with the 
identities of the dead and non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
Tactics of electoral chicanery have advanced with the modern age. So-called 
fraude cibernetico, or cybernetic fraud, refers to computer breakdowns that 
conveniently favor the ruling party, buying time or resulting in altered 
results. 
</P>
<P>
In part because of such tactics, PRI leaders have long been accustomed to what 
is known in the border area as the electoral carro completo, literally, "full 
car," which is better understood north of the international boundary as the 
clean sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Although PAN ultimately emerged triumphant, critics say that wasn't because PRI 
stalwarts didn't try to employ their old electoral shenanigans, a hallmark of 
which are the hornos crematorios, or crematory ovens, where officials have 
overseen the incinerations of opposition ballots. 
</P>
<P>
On election day, opposition leaders were out in force, attempting to prevent 
any large-scale fraud by PRI loyalists. They attempted to have monitors present 
at each of the state's almost 1,200 casillas, or voting precincts. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, early on the morning of July 2, PAN vote-watchers stationed outside of a 
PRI-affiliated neighborhood reported the departures of suspected mapaches, or 
raccoons, as thieves who steal and stuff ballot boxes are known. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing the same old carrusel (carrousel)," bemoaned one opposition 
leader, referring to the practice in which bus and carloads of PRI loyalists 
are driven from precinct to precinct, casting ballots numerous times. 
</P>
<P>
The carrousel riders, noted Mauricio Gonzalez de la Garza, a columnist with the 
Mexicali-based daily La Voz de La Frontera, are also variously known as 
votantes rotatorios, or rotating voters, and ejercitos galopantes de votacion, 
or "galloping vote armies." 
</P>
<P>
In the Tijuana neighborhood known as Colonia Sanchez Taboada, opposition 
observers discovered another old friend: The infamous casilla caminante, or 
walking precinct, which shows up in an area where it's not supposed to be, 
ensuring that only the cognoscenti -- PRI supporters -- are able to find it and 
vote there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pregnant' Ballot Boxes 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, there are the so-called casillas madrugadoras, or early 
morning precincts, whose boxes are already stuffed with ballots marked for the 
PRI by the time voting begins in the morning. Such stuffed ballot boxes are 
also known as embarazadas, or pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
In the same Tijuana neighborhood where the walking precincts occurred, 
opposition leaders charged, the PRI resorted to so-called election day 
tortuguismo, or delays. Huge numbers of voters who lived in other areas were 
assigned to vote in that community, resulting in long lines that served to 
discourage area residents from exercising their franchise. 
</P>
<P>
But if voting precincts can walk why can't ballot boxes dance? Indeed, a few 
days after the vote count began, a Mexicali newspaper headline spoke of reports 
of "Anforas Danzantes," or dancing ballot boxes, at the Tijuana school where 
all of the city's returns were being kept under Army guard. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, quick-working mapaches, those sly raccoons, had attempted to grab 
some of the authentic ballot boxes and replace them with "pregnant" ones. Their 
plans were foiled, however, when journalists from a local weekly were on the 
spot and attempted to photograph the spectacle, scaring them away. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the Mexican government's avowed determination to clean up its 
elections, maybe the need for such tactics will cease. "The magicians and the 
alchemy artists would then be without work," said columnist Gonzalez. But not 
necessarily. "Democracy is not perfect," Gonzalez noted.

JAZZ GIVES LA JOLLA SOUL IN OUT-OF-THE-WAY NICHE;

LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If your timing's right, you can stroll along a back street here and hear a free 
concert by a world-renowned jazzman. 
</P>
<P>
Like the customer who walked into a Draper Avenue tennis shop and asked about 
the lazy strains of a saxophone spilling out from the living room of a nearby 
bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him it was just Charles McPherson, winding up his daily practice 
session," recalled Mark Standlee, owner of the Racket Stringing Workshop. "He 
apparently knew something about jazz, because he just smiled and said it sure 
sounded like McPherson." 
</P>
<P>
In international jazz circles, Charles McPherson is something of a celebrity, 
an alto saxophonist who has played professionally for three decades, touring 
with the likes of bassist Charles Mingus and releasing more than 25 albums of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
But on Draper Avenue, McPherson is just Charles, the guy who practices every 
day in the little house with the white picket fence -- one of two bungalows his 
family has owned on the block for the past 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
McPherson isn't the only one making music on Draper Avenue these days. He's 
among a cadre of jazz musicians who populate a tiny, two-block neighborhood 
between Pearl and Prospect streets that's becoming known to locals and music 
fans alike as Jazz Alley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treble Clef Wind Chimes 
</P>
<P>
On the same block as McPherson's studio, where wind chimes shaped like treble 
clefs dangle above the front door, there's a duplex with an aged piano wedged 
into the tiny living room. 
</P>
<P>
That's where tenor saxophonist Joe Marillo lives with his girlfriend, Susan 
Rathfon, a classical pianist, and Ray Crawford, a local bass player and music 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, more than half a dozen other jazz artists have moved on 
and off the block. Last year, tenor saxophonist Jimmy McCasey lived in a 
trailer behind Marillo's duplex, practicing eight hours a day before rushing 
off to perform gigs after dark. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, there does seem to be a preponderance of jazz music on this block," the 
49-year-old McPherson said recently as he took a break from his playing, 
propping his gold-plated alto in an overstuffed chair like a revered guest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unusual, having all these creative people on one street. But it 
definitely lends the block some aesthetic character. I just don't think enough 
people appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
For these jazzmen and many of their neighbors, Draper Avenue is an oasis of 
music in a town where the sound of money 
</P>
<P>
is often the loudest thing heard. 
</P>
<P>
But the spirit of Draper's jazz is being threatened by the developer's backhoe. 
All around this core of artists, the avenue is growing up, changing. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-year-old houses are being replaced by condominium complexes. A snazzy new 
branch of the San Diego Public Library opened recently, bringing with it more 
traffic and people problems to a street that isn't used to being a 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Draper Avenue, like the rest of La Jolla, is hot property. Since the 
library opened three months ago, property owners on Draper began receiving 
unsolicited offers from realtors. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had offers of almost a million dollars for these two lots alone," said 
McPherson, who lives in North Park but uses the Draper Avenue house as an 
office and studio. "I mean, the Pacific Ocean is right down the street. If my 
family didn't move here in the '40s, I wouldn't even be able to afford to stay 
in this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Tonini, manager of the Jelley Co. real estate firm in La Jolla, said 
property values on Draper are skyrocketing along with the rest in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, La Jolla enjoyed a 45% appreciation in single-family houses," she 
said. "When you have that kind of appreciation, every piece of property looks 
real good, no matter where it is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Cool 
</P>
<P>
Despite the development all around them, the musicians who live and practice 
there say Draper Avenue is still the coolest place around. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Jazz Alley, there's no doubt about it," said Marillo, 50, an 
accomplished tenor player who has performed in nightclubs throughout San Diego 
for more than a decade. "There's some musical energy here. And there's not too 
many residential streets anywhere you can say that about." 
</P>
<P>
The jazz label is only the most recent tag for this colorful stretch of street. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s and '30s, the neighborhood was known as "Browntown," the center of 
a poor, largely black neighborhood, many of whose residents were employed in 
the mansions of rich, white La Jollans in the old Muirlands area. 
</P>
<P>
A generation later, veteran residents say, the enclave had expanded to 
surrounding streets, where Mexican and Filipino families rented modest 
one-bedroom houses. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, Draper Avenue had soul. There was a tiny restaurant called the 
Bar-B-Q Cafe (with the requisite lively jukebox, three selections for a dime). 
There were auto accessory shops mixed in with run-down beach houses, and maybe 
a junkyard here and there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shrank to 2 Blocks 
</P>
<P>
As years passed, Draper continued to shed its skin. A veterinary hospital moved 
in. The barbecue restaurant became Standlee's tennis shop. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood, which once spread across southern La Jolla, shrank to just 
two blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Draper Avenue could not shake its image as a main artery of La Jolla's 
ghetto, a street where shabby apartments changed hands regularly and police 
patrol cars paid visits all too often. 
</P>
<P>
Today, problems still exist. Marillo recently opened his front door to see a 
shooting victim writhing on the sidewalk. He called police, but the man died on 
the spot. 
</P>
<P>
But such is city life, he says -- even in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Marillo moved to Draper Avenue six years ago when his then-wife took a job at a 
restaurant around the corner. When the marriage broke up, Marillo stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bagel and a Beer 
</P>
<P>
He feels as free there as when he's playing languid riffs on the saxophone. 
From his house, he can walk to his job as an instructor at a nearby music 
store, buy a bagel and a beer, do his laundry, go to the beach -- all without 
getting in his car. 
</P>
<P>
"This street is probably one of the best places in the country to live," he 
said. He sits on the piano stool in his living room wearing a pair of blue 
jeans, no shirt. A portrait of saxophone great Sonny Rollins hangs on the wall 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone gave me a house anywhere else, someplace inland, I'd rent it out 
rather than live there. I couldn't live anywhere else. If Sonny Rollins lived 
in La Jolla, he'd live on Draper Avenue, too." 
</P>
<P>
McPherson, who moved to San Diego from New York 10 years ago, soon discovered 
that Draper Avenue had a crazy beat. 
</P>
<P>
"The first week I was here, I met these guys who were playing freestyle jazz in 
their apartment during the day," he recalled. "We jammed together all the time, 
in the afternoons and on Saturdays." 
</P>
<P>
One night, McPherson walked over to nearby Chuck's Steak House on Prospect 
Street, where Marillo was playing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friends and Collaborators 
</P>
<P>
"He was wearing this long, black coat," Marillo recalled. "When we finished, he 
came up to me and said, "Hey, I like the way you play.' When he told me who he 
was, I said, 'Wow! If I'd have known you were in the audience, I wouldn't have 
been able to play at all." 
</P>
<P>
The two became friends. Before long, they were collaborating. 
</P>
<P>
"When Joe is writing a song, he might want to know how things sound. And he 
can't play the saxophone and the piano at the same time. So I'll play the sax 
part for him," McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Or I might get a new mouthpiece and want to know how it sounds without me 
playing it. We use each other for a lot of different reasons." 
</P>
<P>
For Marillo, the collaborations are like a breath of fresh air. "Having Charles 
right down the street is like being back in school, knowing that the teacher is 
right there to give you an answer." 
</P>
<P>
McPherson, who grew up in Detroit, still does international performing tours. 
When he's in town, he spends several hours a day at the Draper studio 
practicing, or "woodshedding," as fellow musicians call it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varied Reactions 
</P>
<P>
The music has brought varied reactions. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made a point to serenade people because I saw them standing outside the 
house listening to me," he said. "Some will knock on the door and ask who I am 
and where they can hear me play." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"One teen-ager stopped and scowled when she heard me play," McPherson said. "If 
I had been playing Van Halen, she probably would have liked it. But the music 
was jazz. So she yelled out some ugly comment about me making too much noise." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Roberts, who works in Standlee's tennis shop, often hears the music as he 
restrings rackets. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear Charles playing every now and then when the wind is right," he said. 
"I've heard him play in clubs in Europe. He's something of a god over there. 
Here, many people walk right on by like they don't even hear him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just sad there isn't any interest in the music here. After all, it's an 
American art form." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Plays Anyway 
</P>
<P>
Marillo, who teaches saxophone and piano lessons at home, has also heard the 
heckling. Not from passers-by, but from his landlord. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't play the piano during the day. She complains if I don't close the 
windows," he said. "But I go ahead and play anyway. I mean, with all the 
parties and the loud radios . . . this is nicer. This is jazz." 
</P>
<P>
And this is the spirit of jazz on Draper Avenue: Two years ago, Jimmy McCasey 
lost his job. His girlfriend left him the same week his mother died. So he 
called his saxophone teacher, Joe Marillo, for help. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no place to live, no job, nothing. I just had my horn," he recalled. 
"Joe offered a trailer for me to live in. He reached out and turned my life 
around." 
</P>
<P>
McCasey, who lived in the trailer for a year before moving away, misses the 
musical vibrations he found along Draper Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe was living with two other musicians. Charles McPherson was right down the 
street," he said. "With all these bad cats around, who could think of a better 
place to hang? It was like heaven." 
</P>
<P>
And so the beat goes on along Draper Avenue. Marillo fears that rising property 
values will only bring more developers, who will force out the remaining rental 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really no reason I'll leave here," said McPherson. "It's not seedy, 
it's nice. There's just something about this street that takes what's good 
about La Jolla and puts it to music, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, McPherson says he may one day write a song about his little stretch of 
creative paradise. "Maybe I'll call it the Draper Avenue Blues." 
</P>
<P>
Then he stopped a moment, reconsidering. "Nah, it wouldn't be a blues number. 
Too many good things happen here. It'd have to be more upbeat, maybe something 
with a little salsa rhythm to it."

JACK SMITH: ON HIS BACK WITH PAIN OF FIRE AND ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of you may have imagined that I was sunning myself in Bermuda last week, 
or cruising to Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
In fact I was at home, flat on my back, and occasionally emitting piteous 
screams. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in years, I had injured my back. I am never quite sure how I 
do it. One of the worst cases I ever had occurred when I was shaving. I merely 
twisted slightly to the right to say something to my wife through the open 
door, and I fell to my knees in agony. 
</P>
<P>
This time it happened when I was trying to get up from a low rattan swivel 
chair in my den. As I rose, with my hands on the arms, the chair swiveled and 
tipped over; I fell. That was it. I was a basket case. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, I was home alone. My wife was visiting relatives for the 
weekend. I lay helpless on the floor, not daring to move. I thought it through. 
Gradually, in great pain, I rolled over and got to my knees and crawled to the 
bedroom. Filling the house with shrieks, I managed to get onto the bed and roll 
over on my back. 
</P>
<P>
The phone rang. Thinking it must be my wife, I faced up to the effort it would 
take to roll off the bed and crawl to the phone. It was my older son. I told 
him I was out of action. He said he would come over the next day and his wife 
could help me. She is a registered physical therapist. That night I didn't try 
to eat. 
</P>
<P>
They arrived the next morning about 10 o'clock. My daughter-in-law, Gail, put 
an electric pad under my back. Then she cooked me some bacon and eggs. I am not 
supposed to eat bacon and eggs, but I do when I'm feeling sorry for myself. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose the details of my ordeal are of little interest to the reader. But 
there is one effect of this particular kind of injury that always strikes me as 
curious if not sinister. 
</P>
<P>
One's screams seem to strike one's loved ones as hilarious. I remember that 
when I hurt myself shaving and fell screaming to my knees, my wife and my sons 
could hardly contain themselves. They staggered about with hysterical laughter, 
holding their sides. It must have something to do, I suspect, with seeing the 
master reduced to a whimpering infant. 
</P>
<P>
My three grandchildren were discreet this time. Mostly they stayed in the 
living room. But occasionally one of my screams would bring them to the bedroom 
door, their faces reflecting profound fascination. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, my daughter-in-law said it was time for the ice treatment. I 
had never had an ice treatment. She rolled me over until my back was off the 
heating pad, then applied a block of ice to the injured spot. 
</P>
<P>
I screamed like the victim in a torture movie. I had not imagined that ice 
could produce such excruciating pain. I blubbered. I begged her to desist. She 
said it took five minutes. After a while I became numb, and it didn't hurt any 
more. 
</P>
<P>
That evening my wife came home and took over. I had appreciated my 
daughter-in-law's professional ministrations, and I'm sure they helped me on my 
way to recovery. However, it was nice to have my own wife at hand. I hoped she 
would be more solicitous of tender feelings. 
</P>
<P>
If I lay quite still, it didn't hurt. But a cough or a sneeze was disastrous. 
That evening I was floating along, half dozing, in a kind of momentary 
euphoria, when my wife came into the bedroom with a towel and something in a 
paper cup. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for the ice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"No!" I shouted. But she insisted. "Gail says it's very important. You want to 
be a baby?" 
</P>
<P>
Reluctantly I submitted. I rolled over to expose my back. She pulled my pajama 
top up. "Where does it hurt?" she asked, probing with her fingers. "There!" I 
shrieked. 
</P>
<P>
She applied the ice. I don't want to say she enjoyed it, but it wouldn't 
surprise me. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not a hero. If I am ever captured by the enemy and tortured, I'll betray my 
country. All they'll have to do is put a chunk of ice on my back.

The Scene: Premiere of "When Harry Met Sally . . . ," the new Rob 
Reiner-directed romantic comedy from Castle Rock Entertainment (released by 
Columbia) that's sure to be the feel-good movie of the summer. A packed 
screening at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills 
preceded the packed party at the Beverly Hilton (travel time between the two 
points was a half-hour) where guests immediately dove for the lavish buffet 
dinner and listened to live big band jazz. Headlining the party, a benefit for 
Comic Relief, was the young, much-hyped jazz guy Harry Connick Jr., who appears 
on the film's sound track. While the studios were pleased with the spillover 
turnout, cramming 1,700 people into the Hilton's ballroom has the unfortunate 
side effect of making sweat break out on the upper lip. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: After a glut of action-adventure pics, the audience seemed grateful 
for a film that didn't involve semi-automatic weapon fire or decapitations. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: The movie cast and crew included director Reiner, star Billy 
Crystal (co-star Meg Ryan was filming in Hawaii), writer Nora Ephron; also 
Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, Richard Lewis, Charlton Heston, Robert Townsend, 
Rick Ducommun, O.J. Simpson, Scott Baio, Lesley Ann Warren, Shelly Long, Bud 
Cort, Carol Kane, John Larroquette, Alan Rachins and Joanna Frank, Judd Nelson, 
Shari Belafonte, Gary Owens, Fred Silverman, Garry Marshall, Ron Perlman, party 
planner Sharon Sacks (she gave the room a Manhattan feel with a skyline 
backdrop) and Comic Relief founder and president Bob Zmuda, who was very 
pleased at the $42,000 raised, which will be turned over to the L.A. Homeless 
Healthcare Project. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: Reiner's new bride, photographer Michele Singer, sweetly admitted she 
wasn't used to being asked for quotes. "I don't know if I should be the one 
quoted," she said. "I've never really done this before." Singer was reassured 
that the Quote Police wouldn't arrest her. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: A mix of everything, from baggy shorts and sneakers to the 
disco-ready look of capri leggings and tight-fitting tops. There was the usual 
sea of suits (light gray and khaki for the summer months, but let's not forget 
those Armani retro ties) and a smattering of "dinner dresses." Anyone dressing 
in lightweight clothes was envied. 
</P>
<P>
The Food: The Beverly Hilton catered up a storm, including smoked salmon, 
caviar, pasta, Mexican food, crepes suzette and Caesar salad. Shelly Long knows 
how to operate at these things; she politely asked a publicist, "Can you show 
me the way to the caviar?" 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment: The crowd continued to turbo-schmooze while the band played, but 
when Connick came out, Reiner persuaded them to listen. "Find a seat, find a 
piece of floor, a lap, whatever," he implored the audience. Most of the guests 
had never heard of Connick, and when he appeared on stage his youthful face 
caused one woman to squeal, "He must be 12!" 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: A good film buoys the spirits, and it was felt at this bash. People 
wanted to stay despite the heat, the hassle-rich drive from the screening to 
the hotel, the fanny-bumping crowd and the late hour. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: The screening was accidentally overbooked, and the overflow wasn't 
entirely happy with the situation. It was quickly remedied with passes to 
another screening and the promise of dinner at the Hilton, which about 70 
people attended. The promise of food is always a good consolation prize.

Dreaming in Color by Ruth Moose (August House: $15.95; 192 pages) 
</P>
<P>
It's very hard to write about people who are poorer and sadder and weirder than 
you without being condescending. Ruth Moose writes about her people with 
exasperation but real respect. 
</P>
<P>
The characters in the 19 stories that make up "Dreaming in Color" sport names 
such as Fronnie and Therma and Ladella and Thildalee. They live in somnolent 
Southern communities where any life of commerce or fun is fading fast: "The 
town is dead enough as it is," one lady thinks. "We don't need any more 
buildings to sit and watch run down. If it wasn't for the bank, drugstore, 
hardware, and Baptist Church, we could just close up shop. Strike Eddysville 
off the map -- if it's on any. I'm the only business still open on my side of 
the street and it's awful." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Moose's people tread that sad and narrow path between the hard-earned 
probity of the lower-middle classes -- bridge mints and broccoli casseroles, 
and tarnished family silver -- and the bleak wastes of hopeless White-Trashdom. 
Often the two classes share a single residential lot in town: The reputable 
families renting out a garage apartment to a poor and seedy "married" couple 
who aren't really married; who won't go to church or bring a covered dish to a 
picnic. The "wife," of course, will soon be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Last Agent 
</P>
<P>
When money and stamina are gone, ritual, however empty, seems to be the last 
agent of momentum. Life in these stories is "going through the motions," no 
more, no less. 
</P>
<P>
The motions here include "beautification projects" for sad towns dead in the 
center, women's club meetings where the women's median age is somewhere in the 
80s, Thanksgiving dinner -- in the family tradition where the relatives you 
wish would stay home show up, year after year, and the ones you love manage to 
be absent, either in body or soul. In "Judas at the Table," a depressed wife 
makes an enormous meal, while her husband peers ominously out the window, 
hating every minute of it, and her daughter stands her up cold. "Sure," the 
wife thinks resentfully of her daughter blithely skiing in the North, "sure, 
the whole Thanksgiving thing is silly to you. Family is silly. Parents are 
silly. Parents who spend themselves silly to send you to that fancy school 
because you failed two others." 
</P>
<P>
When life is limited and essentially hateful, one's only defense is to pass 
that hatred on to someone else, to step on the hands of the people on the rung 
just below you climbing that social ladder. In "Cows, Coat hangers and the K 
mart Kid," the author takes a look at life in a raw new housing development -- 
the "Friendship" of two snippy young moms, Bettye and Sally, whose only bonds 
are their spanking-clean toddlers, and their common loathing for the trapped 
house that stands between them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Their New Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
During the first part of this story, that jerry-built box is inhabited by a 
family with chronically ill children, a car that has a Kotex carton instead of 
a rear window, and a passel of sofas losing their stuffing out on the front 
lawn. Oh, disgusting! But when the "White-Trash" family moves out, a couple of 
conspicuous consumers move in. The wife wears diamond rings and a wet-bar 
appears as part of the permanent furniture. 
</P>
<P>
What's the proper response to all that? The truth is, the author reminds us, 
the whole point of being in a class system is that you're obligated to hate the 
people "above" you quite as much as the people "below." Movement in either 
direction is equally odious, and when a black couple (the only blacks in this 
whole Southern collection) moves into that same tract house, they blow the 
whole social construct sky high. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these stories are a little awkward, the collection is undeniably 
uneven, but the authorial voice is funny and strong. If you care about the 
South, if you cherish your creamed-onion recipe, if you still go through with 
family holidays not because you love them but because you should, you'll like 
this book a lot.

PRESS RELEASE USE CAUSES STIR IN TRIBUNE NEWSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the San Diego Tribune newsroom, staffers are questioning their editors' 
definition of plagiarism when it involves press releases, after a recent 
incident involving a real-estate reporter. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, a story on Los Angeles redevelopment with Trib real estate 
reporter Herb Lawrence's byline was killed by editors when it was discovered to 
be extremely similar to an article that ran in a small Los Angeles business 
magazine. Later it was learned that the story in the magazine, as well as 
Lawrence's story, were derived from a press release. 
</P>
<P>
The story didn't run, and Tribune management apparently took no formal action 
against Lawrence. A veteran of more than 20 years with the paper, and its 
former building editor, Lawrence was suspended for a week in 1982 after he 
lifted large sections of a story from an article in an architectural magazine, 
according to published reports at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in the newsroom said that much of the redevelopment story was taken 
verbatim from the press release. Lawrence declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is disenchantment far and wide in the newsroom over this," said one Trib 
staffer. "We'd like an accounting of what occurred and how it was handled. If 
it was plagiarism, does management condone plagiarism?" 
</P>
<P>
Tribune Deputy Editor Bob Witty refused to discuss specifics of the Lawrence 
case, but he acknowledged that an accusation of plagiarism was recently 
presented to him. Material from a press release was used "liberally," Witty 
said, but it was not a case of plagiarism. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look up the definition of plagiarism, it is the unauthorized use of 
someone's material," Witty said. "When someone sends you a press packet, you're 
entitled to use everything in there." 
</P>
<P>
In general, Witty said, press releases are helpful as background, but it is 
"sloppy to take things too much from releases." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, public relations people don't mind their material being used in 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
"I take that almost as flattery," one public relations veteran said. "I'd be in 
hog heaven if all my press releases were used verbatim." 
</P>
<P>
The standard industry philosophy, echoed by Witty, is that press releases 
should be used only as background information for stories. 
</P>
<P>
But such general guidelines are sometimes ignored. Quotes are taken from 
releases without being identified as prepared statements. Phrases from releases 
are used in bylined stories. Reporters, especially on small papers, simply 
rewrite press releases and put their names on the new product, adding little or 
no new information. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an absolutist," said Don Sneed, professor of journalism at San Diego State 
University. "You can't be a little pregnant. If you're going to take a 
paragraph from a press release, it's wrong. If you're going to take a handful 
of words, that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly all papers use rewritten press releases, without bylines, especially 
as briefs in real-estate and business sections. Some, especially understaffed 
weekly papers, commonly insert press releases into the paper, without bylines, 
as news or informational stories. 
</P>
<P>
But there are gray areas. For example, what if a reporter rewrites a press 
release and adds just a sprinkling of new information? Is it fair to give the 
reporter a byline on the story? 
</P>
<P>
"The question in this case is, is he giving readers the good faith they 
deserve?" said Lee Brown, another San Diego State professor. "In my view, to 
claim for your own work that is not yours is not playing fair with the 
readers." 
</P>
<P>
Until recent times, public relations representatives often would develop 
stories for the real-estate sections of many newspapers, supplying reporters 
with quotes and detailed information. 
</P>
<P>
But times are changing. At the San Diego Union, for instance, there was a 
change in editors two years ago, the real-estate department's staff was 
increased, the section's emphasis was moved away from commercial real-estate 
news, and the policy toward press release information was dramatically changed 
to eliminate the verbatim use of press releases. This created a furor among 
public relations practitioners, some of whom talked of boycotting the section. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Union's real-estate section's policy is to attribute the source if a 
quote or information is used from a press release, according to Lizanne 
Poppens, news editor of the Union's Home section. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably commonplace to have more of an industry approach to 
real-estate news in real-estate sections throughout the country," local public 
relations veteran Jim Frampton said. "About 10 years ago, the trend began 
throughout the industry toward more consumer-oriented sections. There was less 
of a reason to quote Joe Blow from XYZ Builders on the economy," precipitating 
a de-emphasis of press release-supplied information. 
</P>
<P>
The use of press release information in stories has been questioned in the 
Tribune newsroom in the past. A year ago, a columnist was accused of copying a 
few paragraphs from a press release. The Lawrence case has simply raised the 
topic again. 
</P>
<P>
"To do nothing about it reaffirms reporters' laziness" toward press releases, 
one Tribune staffer said. "It's telling them it's OK to do this type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
XTRA-FM (91X) Program Director Trip Reeb is leaving the station to become 
general manager of KROQ in Los Angeles, the granddaddy of the "Cutting Edge of 
Rock" format used by 91X. KROQ's ratings have been foundering lately, and it is 
facing a stern new challenge from KQLZ-FM (Pirate Radio). Reeb replaces Tony 
Berardini, who remains vice president of the station, as well as general 
manager of KROQ's sister station in Boston. Reeb will leave 91X in two weeks, 
after a year and a half with the station. "We wanted someone with an overall 
sense of the radio station who could be here all the time," a KROQ spokeswoman 
said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
XTRA-FM is touting its success in the recently released Birch ratings, which 
lists the station No. 1 among listeners 12 and older. The Birch book tends to 
reflect young listeners more than the commonly used Arbitron system because it 
uses phone surveys instead of the written diaries favored by Arbitron. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In this summer of sequels, it is fitting that KNSD-TV (Channel 39) is once 
again exhorting viewers to send their excrement to Thrifty. Called the "Test 
for Life II," the station is offering free screenings for colorectal cancer to 
those who bring stool samples to the stores. More than 59,000 samples were 
brought in during the first Test for Life in 1987, the station said, with 553 
testing positive. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KPBS-TV's "The Art and Vision of James Hubbell" has been picked up by the 
national PBS prime time network, which includes more than 300 stations. No air 
date has been announced . . . . 
</P>
<P>
There's "Public People, Private Lives," the schmaltzy syndicated talk show 
hosted by Sarah Purcell, and then there's "Public People, Private Lives," the 
locally produced talk show that airs on cable systems throughout Southern 
California. Attorneys for David Eisenberg, producer and host of the local 
program, have sent a letter to Orbis Communications, distributor of the other 
show, advising it that his show was on the air first and thus is entitled to 
the name. No reply yet, and Orbis representatives didn't return a reporter's 
calls last week. The Purcell version isn't exactly burning up the airwaves, so 
Eisenberg said he has been advised to "wait and see" if the show even stays on 
the air.

The executive producer of a CBS documentary on man's first walk on the moon in 
1969 said the program mistakenly showed clips taken on the moon during a 1972 
flight. The program said the 1972 footage was of the historic first moon walk 
by American astronauts. "It was an honest mistake," Perry Wolff said Friday of 
the error in "The Moon Above, the Earth Below," a two-hour special that aired 
Thursday and saluted the 20th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 moon 
flight. The program was co-anchored by Dan Rather and Charles Kuralt. Two 
scenes showed two astronauts -- ostensibly Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin -- 
bouncing on the moon's surface, and then their lunar orbiter blasting off from 
the moon. In a brief interview, Wolff said he had just learned that they 
actually were from the Apollo 17 flight in December, 1972. No deception was 
intended, he emphasized. He blamed the error on a "mislabeled tape" taken from 
a box of more than 100 tapes of footage of moon flights and landings. Claudia

A Pink Floyd concert in Venice, Italy, turned into a fiasco Saturday night when 
police moved in on about 200,000 youths who had packed into St. Mark's Square 
and broken through barriers. Eighty people were reportedly hurt. The band 
played a 90-minute show from a barge the size of a football field anchored in a 
lagoon in front of St. Mark's Square. (Venice has no stadium.) Fans who had 
camped out for as long as 14 hours for the free concert crammed into the 
Piazzetta, a rectangular extension outside St. Mark's Square before they were 
chased away, leaving the group with only an elite local audience in private 
boats -- and the claimed 200 million worldwide television audience. During the 
TV transmission of the 90-minute show, however, not one of the 15 cameras was 
ever aimed at the deserted Piazzetta, empty except for debris. The show's 
producer, the state-owned RAI network, and Granada, sold the concert on the 
basis of the unusual setting. The group's normal performance was hampered by 
orders to keep their amplified sound down to 60 decibels -- a fraction of their 
usual volume. This was a last-minute demand from city officials based on 
concerns that higher sound levels could damage the historic buildings. Claudia

FLORICANTO CELEBRATES MEXICAN CULTURAL IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether known as Floricanto Dance Theater or Danza Floricanto U.S.A. (its new 
name), Gemma Sandoval's home-grown, mom-and-pop folklorico company can both 
celebrate cultural identity for the Mexican-American community and charm 
outsiders with its energy and color. 
</P>
<P>
What it cannot do is rival the great state-supported Mexican ensembles in scale 
and professionalism -- but, unfortunately, it keeps on trying. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of capitalizing on intimacy, dancer personality or connection to the 
material, Floricanto's performance at the Santa Monica College Amphitheater on 
Saturday locked its 16 hard-working dancers into formal group patterns with an 
emphasis on unison footwork. 
</P>
<P>
That footwork often looked well drilled, but the dancers' obvious strain 
throughout the evening proved too high a price. Only in the loose, comic solos 
of the "Lindo Guerrero" suite and a few passages elsewhere did Floricanto 
suggest the sense of people dancing for their own pleasure, rather than a corps 
assigned mass presentational effects. 
</P>
<P>
The most sustained exception: the "La Guacamaya" sequence in the Veracruz suite 
where the men swooped past the women, removing their hats, and the women kept 
turning their heads to find them. Only when focused on one another (rather than 
the audience) and executing expressive movement (rather than arbitrary 
routines), do Floricanto dancers seem free, relaxed, in command. Who can blame 
them? Who really wants to go through life as the third peon from the right? 
</P>
<P>
If Sandoval's spoken introductions are often more interesting than her dances, 
it's simply because they reveal purposes and contexts missing from what we're 
shown, a deeper and more complex Floricanto that she's chosen to leave 
offstage. A pity. She could make a daring contribution by giving us folklorico 
purged of empty spectacle -- Jalisco and Veracuz suites that take us to the 
heart of these regional styles and invite us to perceive Mexican dancers as 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the example of the innovative, accomplished Mariachi Mexicapan ought 
to inspire her. Besides providing vibrant accompaniments, this stylish 
eight-member group held the stage alone with specialties that expressed Mexican 
tradition in a distinctively American manner.LEWIS SEGAL

OCCIDENTAL OPENS ANNUAL FESTIVAL WITH 'RUDDIGORE'

Occidental College opened its 30th annual summer theater festival Friday with a 
bright, sprightly production of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Ruddigore." But if 
Gilbert's spoof of 19-Century melodrama was well served in the Remsen Bird 
Hillside Theater, Sullivan's music fared less well. 
</P>
<P>
Credit director Brian Nelson for the fluid staging and setting an antic tone by 
interpolating the cliche of a villain stealing candy from a baby during the 
Overture. But his bringing the ghosts on stage during the legend of the 
Murgatroyds in Act I reduced their impact when they stepped out of the picture 
frames in Act II. 
</P>
<P>
As Robin, Kevin Pariseau acted with comic flair and mobile facial features, and 
sang in an acceptable sprechstimme. Margaret Scheeper proved an attractive 
Rose, singing with a silvery soprano that grew edgy in the night air. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Syverson was a virile Dauntless, but prone to crooning. As Despard, 
Jonathan Hogan flung his cape wickedly, but sang weakly. George P. Michaels was 
a vocally unsteady Sir Roderic. 
</P>
<P>
As Hannah, LaVonne Alexander combined vocal security and sympathetic acting. 
Kathie Cole Freeman was an eerie, but small-voiced Mad Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
The chorus was well drilled by music director Stephen Gothold. But as the 
ghosts, the men sounded too thin, pale and unthreatening. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Russ Litchfield gamely conducted a small band made up of winds (Allen 
Savedoff), cello (Pamela de Almeida), synthesizer (Philip Orem) and percussion 
(Kris Mettala). But his directing from the side led to some spotty vocal 
entrances, plus a major glitch when the picture frames opened before the 
timpani roll designed to cover any mechanical noise. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Butsch designed the handsome, compact set units, which were warmly lit by 
R. Craig Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
"Ruddigore" continues in repertory at Occidental Summer Theater Festival

HARRELL, BRONFMAN, SETZER SIT IN AT INSTITUTE CONCERT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some prodigiously talented, aspiring young players got some expert help Friday 
night when members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute performed three 
chamber works at Schoenberg Hall, UCLA. Three mentors supplemented the forces 
-- artistic director and cellist Lynn Harrell, Emerson Quartet violinist Philip 
Setzer and pianist Yefim Bronfman. 
</P>
<P>
As one could have anticipated, the virtuosic collaboration of Harrell and 
Setzer in Ravel's Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920-22) became the centerpiece 
of the concert. Harrell's witty, bubbly style and Setzer's more serious, almost 
brooding approach successfully blended and comprehensively explored each 
carefully written nuance of the score. 
</P>
<P>
A last-minute substitution of the Schubert Trio, Opus 99, for the Beethoven 
Quartet Opus 95, yielded some pleasantly surprising results as well. Violinist 
Helen Nightengale rose to the occasion with a commanding performance filled 
with delicate but controlled lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
The last piece on the program, Beethoven's Quintet for Piano and Winds, Opus 
16, proved more problematic. Despite the spirited, polished accompaniment 
provided by Bronfman, the wind players suffered myriad intonation problems, due 
at times to overblowing, but also to a general lack of energy.GREGG WAGER

BASTILLE DAY MUSIC AT GETTY MUSEUM

<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't the best of concerts. It wasn't the worst of concerts. Just like La 
Revolution itself, Saturday's appropriately titled program in the Getty 
Museum's peristyle garden, "Music Before and After Bastille Day," was not 
without mishap. 
</P>
<P>
No one was sent to the guillotine, but there was one casualty earlier in the 
day: Soprano Mary Rawcliffe reportedly fell victim to an allergy. To the rescue 
came Susan Judy, who, on scarcely more than two hours notice, performed 
yeoman's duty in delivering Revolution-era songs by Dalayrac, Gaveaux, Philidor 
and Becourt. Though one had to admire her pure, sweet tone and sensitive 
phrasing, her voice lacked both projection and range and it appeared that she 
had far too little time with which to acquaint herself with the text. 
</P>
<P>
The purely instrumental installments were characterized by rhythmically 
precise, well-balanced ensemble-work and intelligent, stylish phrasing. 
Intonation, however, especially when the strings played double stops, proved a 
recurrent problem. Violinists Elizabeth Blumenstock and Anthony Martin, viola 
da gamba player Martha McGaughey and harpsichordist Arthur Haas brought 
elegance and vigor to Francois Couperin's "Sonade: L'espagnol," but found it 
necessary to retune the period instruments at every possible opportunity. 
McGaughey had some difficulty in negotiating the technical hurdles in Marin 
Marais' Suite, "D'un gout etranger" and some of her notes could barely be 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
Haas gave clean, articulate and highly charged readings of harpsichord works by 
Claude-Benigne Balbastre, among them a spirited march based on the 
"Marseillaise." TERRY McQUILKIN

People who use chewing tobacco and snuff appear to get as much nicotine as 
cigarette smokers, and the practice may also increase their risk for heart 
disease and various forms of cancer, researchers reported. A new study by 
researchers at UC San Francisco, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, 
found men who used "smokeless tobacco" were exposed to about as much nicotine 
as cigarette smokers. The study also found that like cigarette smoking, 
smokeless tobacco use also increased the heart rate and blood pressure, and 
chewing tobacco appeared to expose users to potentially cancer-causing 
chemicals. An estimated 16 million Americans use smokeless tobacco. Its use has 
been linked to an increased risk of developing oral cancer and gum disease.

Israel's chief of staff has ordered an inquiry into reports of violence within 
one of the country's elite army units. A military spokesman said the order by 
Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron followed a military court verdict last week in the case of 
a soldier who said he shot himself in the leg after being persecuted by fellow 
recruits in the Givati infantry brigade. Testimony at the trial included claims 
of violence among soldiers in the brigade, including verbal and physical abuse 
of officers. Official military sources said the accusations related to only 
one, since-disbanded company in the brigade.

The brother-in-law of Venezuela's president was reported kidnaped in Colombia 
while another group released the nephew of Colombia's interior minister after 
85 days in captivity, authorities said in Bogota. Authorities blamed the rebel 
National Liberation Army in the Friday night kidnaping of wealthy Venezuelan 
rancher Noberto Rodriguez, who was visiting a farm in northeastern Colombia. He 
is the brother-in-law of Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez and formerly 
served as a Venezuelan consular officer in Colombia. In Cali, 200 miles 
southwest of Bogota, Jaime Correa, a lawyer and notary public who is a nephew 
of Minister Raul Orejuela Bueno, was freed by members of the Jorge Eliecer 
Gaitan guerrilla group, family members said.

A group of American Jews staged new protests against the presence of a Roman 
Catholic convent at the former Nazi death camp of Auschwitz in Poland. Five of 
the group, dressed in striped concentration camp uniforms, climbed over the 
fence of the convent, two days after they were assaulted by Polish workers on 
the same spot. Witnesses said that Rabbi Avraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute 
of New York and four of his disciples were undisturbed after they entered the 
convent yard.

HEAVY RAIN POUNDS MID-ATLANTIC STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heavy rain drenched parts of the mid-Atlantic states, flooding streams and 
low-lying areas, and a tornado was reported in Durham, N.C. Storms were 
widespread from North Carolina to New York, dumping five inches of rain at 
Madison, Va., 4.25 inches at Kinsale, Va., and 3.80 at Whalleysville, Md. 
Officials evacuated 18 to 20 residents of one apartment complex in Chapel Hill, 
N.C., when water overflowed the banks of a nearby creek. In Granville County, 
N.C., secondary roads washed out after an estimated 3.5 inches of rain fell in 
six hours. In Durham, strong wind gusts up to 50 m.p.h. downed power lines and 
uprooted several trees, but there were no reports of injuries. A police officer 
reported seeing a funnel cloud touch down and a section of a concrete storage 
building was destroyed, officials said. But the National Weather Service said 
it could not confirm that a tornado had hit the area.

The Bush Administration has decided to ban the sale to India of a sophisticated 
missile-testing device and has expressed concern to France about reports of an 
offer to sell advanced rocket technology to Brazil, U.S. officials said. The 
two steps reflect a toughening U.S. stand on the sale of sophisticated 
technology and know-how to Third World nations seeking to develop their own 
ballistic missiles. A license for the sale to India of a $1.2-million system 
used to put re-entry vehicles under simulated stress has been under debate for 
some time. The French-led consortium Arianespace reportedly has offered missile 
technology to Brazil if the Brazilians agree to use the Ariane rocket for two 
new communications satellites.

"The only thing you can do is wait and see," said Danny Wells, a district union 
representative in Madison, W. Va., as coal miners in Appalachian mines were 
deciding whether to follow their Midwestern and Southern colleagues back to 
work. Wildcat walkouts by as many as 46,000 miners supporting 1,900 striking 
Pittston Coal Group workers have idled much of the nation's coal production 
since June 12. The number of wildcat strikers fell to 37,000 last week. And 
16,000 -- all the miners in Alabama, Illinois and Indiana and some in Kentucky 
-- are expected to return for their next scheduled shifts. Union leaders in 
Pennsylvania said they believed the 7,500 miners in their state would return by 
today. That put pressure on miners in West Virginia, Ohio and Tennessee.

VALDEZ TAKES MORE DAMAGE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rough seas have caused further damage to the tanker Exxon Valdez, which 
continues to leak small amounts of an unidentified substance into the ocean off 
San Diego, the U.S. Coast Guard said. Heavy seas bent back three more steel 
plates from the tanker's bottom, bringing the total to nine, Coast Guard Lt. Ed 
Bass said. The jagged steel plates hanging from the tanker's bottom make its 
draft too deep for San Diego's port where the Valdez was being towed for 
repairs. The Exxon tanker, which caused the worst oil spill ever in the United 
States when it ran aground in Alaska in March, has been towed to calmer waters 
about 20 miles off San Clemente Island, Bass said. Despite the new damage, the 
vessel is still structurally sound, an Exxon spokeswoman said.

Delivering estrogen through a melt-in-your-mouth tablet reduces the hot flashes 
of menopause without risking liver damage from larger doses that are required 
for pills that are swallowed, a study at the University of Southern California 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
The tablet dissolves over three to five minutes while held in the buccal, or 
hollow, cavity of the cheek. This allows the estrogen to enter the bloodstream 
through the cheek's mucous membrane rather than through the digestive system. 
</P>
<P>
"Smaller doses are needed to get enough of the drug in circulation, so the 
estrogen's adverse effect on the liver is reduced," said Dr. Donna Shoupe, a 
USC assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology and co-principal 
investigator in the study. 
</P>
<P>
The study of 60 women tracked hot flashes over eight-hour periods by measuring 
skin temperature and skin resistance before medication and after four weeks of 
taking it. Overall, the drug reduced hot flashes 80% to 90%, Shoupe said.

APOLLO 20 YEARS LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEN SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago this week, the United States' Apollo 11 spacecraft landed the 
first humans on the surface of the moon, fulfilling a dream shared by poets and 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
That accomplishment stands as one of the great feats of modern science and is 
one whose legacy continues to be felt today. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than the pyramids, I don't know what other accomplishment by man even 
compares with it," said Christopher Kraft, former director of Apollo mission 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
When Astronaut Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, he did 
more than fulfill President John F. Kennedy's bold promise of 1961 to land a 
man on the moon before the end of the decade. Coming at a time of political and 
social turmoil, the landing unified a nation and provided some much-needed 
heroes -- most notably the Apollo 11 crew, Armstrong, Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin 
Jr. and Michael Collins. 
</P>
<P>
But there were others among Apollo's 200,000 scientists, engineers and 
technicians who were the unknown, unseen heroes. They fought the lesser-known 
but critical battles of technology at a time when computerization was in its 
infancy, and they won. If they had not, the mission might have ended in 
disaster or there might have been no Apollo at all. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Elverum was one of those people. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, Elverum was an engineer at TRW in Inglewood designing rocket engines 
that he hoped would someday be used in space. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had already decided to use 
the Gargantuan Saturn 5 engines to launch Apollo vehicles out of the Earth's 
atmosphere, but bringing a manned craft down to the moon's surface would 
require the development of an additional engine capable of controlled descent. 
</P>
<P>
Elverum thought he had that engine. 
</P>
<P>
Because it would serve as both a brake and booster for the descent vehicle, 
Elverum's design allowed the thrust and direction of the engine to be adjusted 
by the vehicle's occupants. Should the need to change landing locations arise 
midway through descent, the astronauts would be able to modify the speed and 
trajectory of the craft accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Although not involved in the original bidding process for the descent engine, 
Elverum and a team from TRW approached NASA contractors with their plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an idea for how that engine ought to really be made, and we want to 
talk to you about it," Elverum told the contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The contractors listened and, based on engine designs Elverum had made for much 
smaller vehicles and positive test results achieved with their scaled-up 
versions, eventually awarded TRW the contract for the only engines that have 
ever landed men on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very intense time period," recalled Elverum, now a senior 
propulsion engineer at TRW. "We were not a known name in propulsion at that 
time . . . but we submitted a proposal and, lo and behold, we won." 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the Apollo 11 landing, Elverum and his crew were stationed at a 
test facility in Bethpage, N.Y., where they monitored a full-scale mock-up of 
the Apollo lander. Should anything go wrong with the engine during descent, 
they would be asked to give technical advice to the astronauts in space. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, if they were pushing buttons and the engines didn't start, we 
could in real time look at all the stuff and say, 'Here, try this, try that,' " 
Elverum explained. 
</P>
<P>
The engines performed flawlessly, however, responding on cue, even when 
Armstrong was forced seconds before touchdown to take manual control of the 
descent to avoid landing in a boulder field. Toggling the engine's control 
switch, a feature which Elverum had included in the design, Armstrong landed 
the craft safely, away from the lunar boulders. As Armstrong would later 
comment on the landing, the engine performed without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
In years to come, the engine would be used successfully for tasks it was never 
designed to perform, as witnessed in the aborted Apollo 13 moon mission in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
On that mission, an oxygen tank attached to the craft's service module exploded 
halfway to the moon, leaving the three astronauts drifting in space. Using the 
landing vehicle as a lifeboat, however, the astronauts were able to swing 
around the moon and direct the craft back to Earth, using Elverum's engine as 
their only propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was called on, the engine worked. You feel good about that," Elverum 
said. "When life gets tough, you can always look back and say there was 
something that worked and we accomplished it." 
</P>
<P>
If not for the split-second decision of another relatively unknown Apollo 11 
player, however, Elverum's engine might never have had the chance to perform so 
perfectly in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Before beginning its final descent to the moon's surface, the Apollo 11 lander, 
called Eagle, experienced a series of problems in its communication and 
navigational systems. 
</P>
<P>
After several hours in orbit around the moon while still attached to the Apollo 
command module and another period of orbit after separation, "everything looked 
fairly OK," said Steven Bales, who was the mission's 26-year-old guidance 
officer stationed back on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
As Eagle circled around from the dark side of the moon, preparing to begin the 
final descent process, "the communications were dropping in and out . . . and 
there were indications, ever so subtle, that possibly the down-range (landing) 
distance was a little off," Bales said. 
</P>
<P>
Ground control crews considered the problems manageable, however, and the 
lander was given permission to begin its descent. But within moments, Bales 
noticed that Eagle's navigational computer was registering a descent rate of 
about 20 feet per second slower than the module was actually traveling. 
</P>
<P>
Had the discrepancy grown to 35 feet per second, it would have disrupted 
navigation to the point where the descent would have to be aborted altogether, 
Bales said. But because it remained constant, he was able to give the go-ahead 
for the process to continue. 
</P>
<P>
But no sooner did that crisis pass than a systems alarm in Eagle began to 
sound, indicating more trouble with the vehicle's computer. The alarm, known as 
a "12 02" warning, showed that because of an informational overload, the 
computer was not completing some necessary calculations. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are in the middle of the descent, we had just had a navigational 
concern and . . . we hear this program alarm. It was really a shock," Bales 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By chance, a similar problem had arisen in a simulation of the landing a few 
weeks earlier, and it had been determined that if the alarms came infrequently 
enough, the landing would not necessarily have to be aborted. The definition of 
infrequent, however, was left to the flight controller's discretion and a 
go/no-go decision based on the alarms would essentially be a judgment call. 
</P>
<P>
"So in a period of about 20 seconds I made up my mind that it was OK to 
continue," Bales explained. 
</P>
<P>
Although six more computer alarms cropped up over the next several minutes, 
Bales stuck by his decision, and after about 15 minutes, he and others back on 
Earth heard the static-tinged voice of Armstrong announce: "Houston, 
Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." 
</P>
<P>
With the thousands of workers involved in the lunar program, it is not 
surprising that the majority have gone unrecognized. Aldrin himself, though 
known by millions of Americans as Armstrong's only companion in the Eagle 
lander, is destined to be remembered as the second man to set foot on the moon. 
People "want to say that (I) feel bad because he went out first, but I think 
it's small people who say that," Aldrin said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he is also the person who called out altitude and directional readings 
for Armstrong when problems in the Eagle's navigational computer forced a 
manual landing. Without that information, such a descent would probably have 
been impossible and could have ended in tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Although after touchdown Aldrin followed Armstrong out onto the surface of the 
moon by less than 20 minutes, it is Armstrong's name, not Aldrin's, which comes 
to mind when recalling the historic landing and subsequent moon walk. 
</P>
<P>
In the years after Apollo 11, Aldrin has acknowledged that he developed a 
substance abuse problem in coping with the impact of the moon landing on his 
life and underwent psychiatric treatment for depression related to it. Now 
recovered, Aldrin said he holds no bitterness about his involvement in the moon 
program or about the lesser position he held on that mission. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm very satisfied with my ability to project my talents to be very 
useful in the space program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But like many involved in the Apollo program, Aldrin questions whether future 
space accomplishments can match Apollo's intensity and excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"Project Apollo was the single most audacious endeavor in human history," he 
wrote several years after the landing. "When future generations remember 
Apollo, just as we now recall the voyages of Columbus . . . they will remember 
(that) in July, 1969, people like themselves first set foot on the moon."

Scientists have detected new evidence that ozone concentrations decline 
periodically over the Arctic, as in the annual depletion that forms the "ozone 
hole" over Antarctica. The researchers found a high-altitude ozone deficit that 
resembles an early step in formation of the Antarctic ozone hole, said study 
co-author D. J. Hofmann. 
</P>
<P>
Previous research has also suggested ozone depletions over the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic hole is an area in which up to 50% of atmospheric ozone 
disappears for a limited time. In the Arctic, perhaps 25% could disappear under 
highly unusual, worst-case circumstances, Hofmann said. 
</P>
<P>
The new study is reported in the British journal Nature by Hofmann, who is a 
physics professor at the University of Wyoming, and scientists from France, 
Japan, New Zealand and the University of Houston.

REWARDS ARE OFFERED FOR IDENTITIES OF FIRMS LINKED TO WATER POLLUTION 
</P>

Disappointed by the Environmental Protection Agency's delay in cleaning up 
contaminated ground water in the San Gabriel Valley, about 1,100 members of a 
church-based community organization voted Sunday to offer rewards to 
individuals who identify companies responsible for the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
But an EPA official, who spoke at the East Valleys Organizations' annual 
assembly at St. John the Baptist Church auditorium in Baldwin Park, said it 
would be difficult to positively identify the sources of the pollution that has 
affected 20% of the 200-square-mile San Gabriel Valley water basin and seeped 
into 245 of the area's 400 wells. 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal Superfund law, which provides money to remove toxics, the EPA 
must try to recover expenses from companies that caused the damage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Habits 
</P>
<P>
"While I support the concept of having citizens on the alert for companies that 
spill (toxic) materials, it's going to be very, very hard and very complex 
because for 50 years or longer industry and others have deliberately put 
contaminants in the ground water," said Jeffrey Zelikson, director of hazardous 
waste management in EPA's western region. 
</P>
<P>
The reward program was endorsed Sunday by Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner, Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente), and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Both Torres and Roos told the gathering that they would consider proposing 
legislation in support of the program. Their endorsements were followed by 
bursts of applause and standing ovations from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the reward program will be worked out at a conference of EVO 
leaders, Reiner and Torres. EVO is a coalition of 12 San Gabriel Valley and 
Pomona Valley churches, and claims a membership of 35,000 families.

TOUR DE FRANCE;

LEMOND LEAVES FIGNON 40 SECONDS BACK IN ALPS

<P>
Greg LeMond kept saying he would be hard pressed to keep the lead once the Tour 
de France entered its mountain stages in the Pyrenees and Alps. 
</P>
<P>
And after the stages through the Pyrenees last week, LeMond of Minneapolis lost 
the lead to Laurent Fignon of France. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday, saying he feels stronger than when he won the tour in 1986, LeMond 
regained the lead with an impressive performance in an individual time trial in 
the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
High amid the picturesque mountains, LeMond took fifth place in the race 
against the clock to once again take the leader's yellow jersey. Fignon winner 
in 1983 and 1984, fell into second place, 40 seconds behind LeMond. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have the yellow jersey again but the most important is to take it 
as it goes," LeMond said, knowing there is still a week to go before the 
cycling race ends in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"But I feel as fresh as I ever felt in the Tour de France, which is quite 
unusual," he said. "In '86, I had a lot more mental stress than I do now." 
</P>
<P>
Since his victory, however, he has suffered various misfortunes. A hunting 
accident, an emergency appendectomy and leg problems made him miss the last two 
years of the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I am getting stronger and I haven't had any bad days," LeMond said. 
"I'd say I am feeling probably as good as I have been since then. I'm probably 
not climbing as well but I am making great improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good. I probably could have pushed it harder the last hill. I have to 
say that hill time trials are not my specialty." 
</P>
<P>
Fignon, who held a seven-second margin going into the 15th stage, finished 10th 
Sunday, 47 seconds behind LeMond. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Hampsten of Boulder, Colo. faltered in Sunday's climb and finished in 
1:13:30. He dropped to seventh overall, more than seven minutes behind LeMond. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Rooks of the Netherlands won the stage in 1 hour 10 minutes 42 seconds 
over the 25-miles from Gap to Orcieres-Merlette. The last five miles were up 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
Marino Lejaretta of Spain was second in 1:11:06 and defending champion Pedro 
Delgado of Spain was fourth in 1:11:31, gaining just a handful of seconds on 
LeMond, who was clocked in 1:11:39. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was going to do a good race," Le Mond said. "I was afraid of losing 
more than a minute to Delgado but I just lost eight seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Delgado is in fourth place overall, 2:48 back, with four more stages in the 
Alps to go after a rest day today. Then there is a relatively flat stage on 
Saturday with a closing time trial from Versailles to Paris Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Fignon and LeMond, the only American to win the race, have traded the lead 
since July 6. First LeMond held it for five days through last Tuesday. Then 
Fignon took over with a burst up a mountain in the second stage in the 
Pyrenees. 
</P>
<P>
The lead stayed that way over the flat sections through southern France. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's climb from 2,400 feet to 6,003 feet had two slopes rated first 
category in steepness and difficulty. The first lasted most of the first six 
miles of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond won the last time trial to Rennes on July 6 that put him in the lead, 
but he wasn't expecting to do so well here. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid of pushing it to my limit, but I was afraid of exploding," LeMond 
said. Exploding is a term racers use to describe the sensation when they run 
out of power. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond feared the mountains since problems in the steep sections of the Tour of 
Italy a month ago. But he held up well in the Pyrenees last week and held up 
even better Sunday in the Alps.

<P>
John McEnroe pulled out of this week's Davis Cup semifinal against defending 
champions West Germany because of a shoulder injury, U.S. team officials said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Gilbert, ranked 15th in the world, will replace fifth-ranked McEnroe as 
the other singles player on the U.S. team, U.S. Tennis Assn. spokesman Ed 
Fabricius said from Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Fabricius said McEnroe, whose shoulder pain and stiffness forced him to 
withdraw from the doubles competition at the recent Wimbledon championships, 
was diagnosed as having rotator cuff tendinitis. McEnroe was examined Friday by 
Irving Glick, the chief physician at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert has a 3-1 career record against Wimbledon champion Boris Becker, who 
will play singles and doubles for West Germany. Fabricius said U.S. captain Tom 
Gorman talked to Tim Mayotte and French Open champion Michael Chang about 
taking McEnroe's place, but both were unavailable for next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Chang has recently returned to the United States after a holiday in Europe and 
Mayotte is still playing in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi will play the other singles as planned, with Ken Flach and Robert 
Seguso teaming up in the doubles. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans tried not to let McEnroe's absence affect their morale for the 
encounter at Munich's indoor Olympic arena. 
</P>
<P>
"We were disappointed when we heard John was out, but now we are here we have 
got to pull together and do what we are here to do. That is win," Flach said. 
</P>
<P>
West German doubles player Eric Jelen acknowledged that McEnroe's absence 
increased the chances of the already-favored West Germans to win. "But it is 
obviously a blow to the event as a spectacle," he said.

MCENROE TO MISS DAVIS CUP BECAUSE OF INJURY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The highly anticipated Davis Cup matchup between the United States and West 
Germany this weekend took on a new light Sunday with the withdrawal of American 
star John McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who holds just about every U.S. Davis Cup record for matches played 
and victories, withdrew because of tendinitis in his serving shoulder, an 
injury that he suffered during a doubles match at Wimbledon. After he hurt his 
shoulder at Wimbledon, he lost to Stefan Edberg in three close sets in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe's replacement will be Brad Gilbert, the Northern Californian who has 
played Davis Cup for team captain Tom Gorman before, who won a bronze medal for 
a U.S. team led by Gorman at the '88 Olympics in Seoul and who has a history of 
being a difficult opponent for German star Boris Becker. Gilbert has beaten 
Becker in three of their four meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Gilbert over young American star Michael Chang, the Placentia 
player who won the French Open in May, has the potential to be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman, contacted Monday morning in Munich, said that he talked directly to 
Chang in the middle of last week, when McEnroe began to indicate he might not 
be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Michael and was told he would not be available," Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang's father, Joe Chang, when reached in Placentia Sunday night, said that he 
had heard nothing about McEnroe's inability to play. 
</P>
<P>
"That is news to me," Joe Chang said. "The last we heard, John was healthy and 
ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that his family and Michael had just returned from a fishing trip, 
and that his son was mentally and physically tired after having been away from 
home for 2 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman said he also spoke to Tim Mayotte, a fast-court specialist who would 
appear to be well-suited for competition on the fast Pegulan carpet the match 
will be played on in Munich's Olympia Halle Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly, I'm concerned with the players who are going to play," Gorman said. 
"I'm sure that those who couldn't make it all had valid reasons. The lateness 
of this situation made things difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to have Brad Gilbert here. When I called him, he didn't even pause 
or ask any questions. He just said, 'When do you want me there?' I really like 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"And it has been interesting to watch the German press. You (American press) 
have asked more questions about picking Gilbert than eight or so of them did in 
a full press conference. They seemed quite concerned about Gilbert. They know 
he has beaten Becker a lot, and they know he has also handled Eric Jelen many 
times over the years. They see Gilbert as a real threat." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman said that McEnroe started to talk about not being able to play about the 
middle of last week, but he needed to have more tests by doctors. Once those 
tests were completed Friday, the diagnosis was that he could seriously injure 
himself if he tried to play in Munich and that he needed three to six weeks of 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
With McEnroe missing, Gilbert will be joined by Andre Agassi to play singles 
against Becker and Carl-Uwe Steeb and Robert Seguso and Ken Flach will face 
Becker and Jelen in doubles.

L.A. INVITATIONAL SWIM MEET; 
</P>
<P>
EVANS, STEINSEIFER POOL TALENTS ON FINAL DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The L.A. Invitational Swim Meet tied together the past and the present of 
American women's swimming Sunday and, in so doing, unwrapped what looks to be a 
bright future. 
</P>
<P>
The past: Carrie Steinseifer, who won a 1984 gold medal in the 100-meter 
freestyle but later quit swimming altogether, won the 100-meter butterfly 
Sunday as the four-day invitational ended. 
</P>
<P>
The present: Janet Evans, three-time gold medalist at the 1988 Olympics, won 
the 200-meter individual medley by four seconds after finishing second in the 
100-meter backstroke, an event she hadn't competed in since she was 10. 
</P>
<P>
The future: Steinseifer, 21, and Evans, 17, were among a handful of swimmers to 
qualify for U.S. Senior Nationals which will be held July 31-Aug. 4 right back 
at USC's Olympic Swim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Just three months ago, it not only appeared that Steinseifer wouldn't qualify 
for nationals, but it also appeared that she didn't much care. She had quit 
swimming for eight months because she says the sport ceased being fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I left with the intention of never coming back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she did return, much to the dismay of those opponents she blew out of the 
water in the 100-meter butterfly Sunday with a 1:03.78. The only swimmer to 
stay close was top-qualifier Francie Oleary, who finished with a 1:04.07. 
Steinseifer also won the 100-meter freestyle on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to see her hungry again," said Pierre LaFontaine, her coach. "I 
don't think she ever lost the taste for winning." 
</P>
<P>
Steinseifer began training again in April, putting her a little behind in 
training, but, as this weekend proved, a little ahead of her competition. She 
has flourished as a member of the Phoenician Swim Team, a group that refuses to 
keep quiet whenever she swims. 
</P>
<P>
"I just missed swimming," Steinseifer said. "It had provided a lot of 
excitement and happiness in my life. . . . I still think there are a lot of 
good swims left in this body." 
</P>
<P>
In other events Sunday, Andrea Cecchi of Italy, who set a meet record in the 
100-meter breast-stroke with a time of 1:04.45 in the preliminaries, was 
disqualified before the finals for failing to check in after the preliminaries. 
Richard Schroeder, who finished fourth in the event at the 1988 Olympics, won 
with a time of 1:04.84. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 200-meter individual medley, Ray Looze set a meet record at 
2:07.10, and Joyce Lightfoot and Olympian Lars Jorgensen won the 1,500-meter 
freestyles.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
EVANS, STILL GOING STRONG, HITS TWO HOME RUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American League likes to brag about the achievements of its 42-year-old 
pitcher, Nolan Ryan. The fireballing right-hander throws almost as hard as he 
did when he broke into the majors more than 21 years ago. And he's having 
another banner year, too. 
</P>
<P>
The National League has a 42-year-old it is proud of, too. He's Darrell Evans. 
It is much more difficult to play every game at a regular position than it is 
to pitch every five or six days for any player, let alone one over 40. 
</P>
<P>
But the Atlanta Braves pick the spots for Evans and he can still contribute 
offensively. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, playing first base Sunday at Atlanta, hit two long home runs to lead the 
Braves to a 6-2 victory over the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
In a game delayed by rain three times for a total of 2 1/2 hours, Evans 
produced the big blows for rookie pitcher Marty Clary, now 3-0 after being 
recalled from triple-A Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
The home runs gave Evans 409 for his career, breaking a tie with former Dodger 
star Duke Snider for 21st place on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
Clary, who gave up just one run in 6 2/3 innings but departed after the second 
rain delay, was not yet in his teens in 1973 when Evans had his first big home 
run year, when he hit 41 for the Braves. As recently as 1987, after his 40th 
birthday, he hit 34 for the Detroit Tigers. He has six this season in only 128 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Davey Johnson of the Mets knows all about the 1973 season. He also 
played for the Braves and hit 43 homers. Henry Aaron had 40 that year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to see my friend Darrell doing well," Johnson said. "But I wish he 
didn't have to do it against us. I would have enjoyed it more watching him do 
it on television." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Russ Nixon of the Braves doesn't have a right-handed hitting first 
baseman. But he figured that left-hander Bob Ojeda, who isn't overpowering, 
would have some trouble with Evans. 
</P>
<P>
"The old man did a job today," Nixon said. "He really picked us up. I just have 
to find the right spots for him. He can still help." 
</P>
<P>
Except for Howard Johnson, who hit his 23rd home run and doubled and scored the 
other run, the Mets again failed to produce much offense. 
</P>
<P>
They went into Atlanta figuring to start their move in the Eastern Division. 
Instead, they only managed to split the four-game series. They trail Montreal 
by 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, Cincinnati 3 -- Although they managed to extend their lead in the 
East, the Expos couldn't really be all that proud of winning three out of four 
at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
They had considerable trouble against a team missing five regulars because of 
injuries, including three-fourths of its infield. 
</P>
<P>
In the finale, the Expos scored three runs in the 12th to win a game in which 
both clubs played poorly. There were six errors (four by the Expos), 17 walks, 
two wild pitches and 26 strikeouts in the game which lasted four hours eight 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Santovenia had a run-scoring single in the 12th inning, then Otis Nixon 
singled with the bases loaded to break the game open. 
</P>
<P>
"We are struggling," Red Manager Pete Rose said. "But we had opportunities. We 
were 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position." 
</P>
<P>
It was a costly win for Montreal. Shortstop Spike Owen, one of the reasons the 
Expos are leading the division, suffered a severe ankle sprain in the fourth 
inning while sliding into third base and was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 3, Pittsburgh 1 -- In the West the first-place Giants, even 
though their best pitcher, Rick Reuschel, is in a slump, are playing as if they 
intend to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
They welcomed Scott Garrelts off the disabled list just in time for him to 
pitch a strong game at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Garrelts (7-3) restricted the Pirates to two hits and an unearned run in six 
innings and the Giants stretched their lead to three games over Houston, which 
had its game in Philadelphia rained out. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Brantley and Steve Bedrosian completed the two-hitter, with Bedrosian 
getting his 13th save. He has seven in eight chances since the Giants obtained 
him from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Garrelts has been out since June 29 with a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sharper than I thought I would be," Garrelts said. "I felt more 
butterflies than usual in the first couple of innings before I settled down to 
a groove. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, without a home run from either Will Clark or Kevin Mitchell, 
improved their home record to 31-15, best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 4, Chicago 3 -- After being dominated by the Cubs all season, the 
Padres finished up their play against them at San Diego wishing for more. 
</P>
<P>
When pinch-hitter Tim Flannery hit a sacrifice fly with the bases loaded in the 
sixth inning to break a tie, it gave the Padres their third win in a row over 
the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Chris James had three hits, including a second-inning home run. DAN HAFNER

NEWSWIRE: ROSE'S LAWYERS GO FOR ANOTHER VICTORY IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose's lawyers will file papers in Columbus, Ohio with a federal judge who 
is deciding which court system will try Cincinnati Reds' manager case against 
Major League baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's lawyers have until noon to file their brief with U.S. District Judge 
John D. Holschuh, who will decide whether Rose's lawsuit against Commissioner 
Bart Giamatti should be decided in a state or a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Holschuh's office said the judge will not decide by today. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's lawyers want the case returned to Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge 
Norbert A. Nadel, who granted Rose a temporary restraining order last month 
that stopped Giamatti from holding a hearing with Rose on allegations and 
evidence that the manager bet on his own team. 
</P>
<P>
Nadel also barred Giamatti and the Reds from suspending Rose or taking any 
other action against him.

UCLA'S HENLEY, AUBURN'S SMITH SIGN WITH RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams announced Sunday the signing of two second-round draft picks, former 
UCLA cornerback Darryl Henley and former Auburn linebacker Brian Smith, both of 
whom received four-year, $1.2-million deals. 
</P>
<P>
The signings left the Rams to contend with first-round choices Bill Hawkins and 
Cleveland Gary, second-round pick Frank Stams and ninth-round choice Vernon 
Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had hoped to sign all three second-round choices by the end of this 
week before digging into tougher negotiations with University of Miami draft 
choices Hawkins, a defensive end, and Gary, a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
And based on the relatively painless signings of Henley and Smith over the 
weekend, Stams shouldn't be far behind. In fact, the linebacker from Notre Dame 
and 45th pick overall is in the area, staying with his visiting parents at a 
friend's home in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The deals signed Sunday exceed what the team paid each of its three 
second-round choices a year ago. Both Henley, the 53rd pick overall, and Smith, 
the 48th choice, bettered the contract signed last year by cornerback Anthony 
Newman, who signed a four-year, $1.1-million deal as the 35th overall pick.

STARS TOAST PAL WITH A LOT OF MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I don't care if you are Batman ... park that thing on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inscription on 80th-birthday card for Howard Washington. 
</P>
<P>
It's a touchy job, deciding who gets to park in the lot and who's left out on 
the street, but according to the folklore at Warner Bros. Records, 80-year-old 
Howard Washington has rarely let a rock star's VIP status get in the way. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is famous for telling the best of them to park on the street, 
whether they're Prince or Madonna or anybody else who doesn't have an assigned 
parking slot -- or who arrives when all the other spaces in the too-small lot 
are already taken. 
</P>
<P>
Not too surprisingly, everyone respectfully obeys the man who holds the key to 
their parking futures. Parking access is a highly regarded perk, a status 
symbol on most show-biz lots. Plus, Washington possesses a commanding voice (at 
50 yards) and subtle but certain, you'd-be-a-fool-to-mess-with-me presence. 
</P>
<P>
He also has a garden on the lot where he grows eggplant, cantaloupe, tomatoes, 
artichokes, string beans, peppers, petunias and marigolds, right there in 
beautiful downtown Burbank where space is at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Philosophy Corner' 
</P>
<P>
Washington's garden patch is just outside his air-conditioned, stereo-wired 
guard shack, also known as "the philosophy corner" to employees such as Adam 
Somers, senior vice president of creative services. "You can come in in the 
morning and hang out with Howard and he talks about money, women, divorce, the 
company -- the long view of things," Somers said. 
</P>
<P>
The senior vice president, who is white, didn't hesitate to jokingly tell the 
crowd at the birthday party for Washington, who is black, that "all the stories 
that I'm Howard's illegitimate son are true." And he pointed out that 
Washington has handled far more than parking-related duties for the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
One time, Somers recalled, he needed to get a bulldozer for an advertising 
photo session and he needed it within half an hour. Knowing that the usual 
bureaucratic channels of the company would delay the shoot, perhaps for days, 
Somers turned to Washington. "Howard called me back and said, 'You think you 
can come up with a six-pack of beer and six cassettes?' " said Somers, adding 
that the bulldozer appeared within half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
David Lee Roth, rock's Spandex king, was on hand to emcee the Friday-afternoon 
festivities and told the gathering of Warner Bros. Records employees and 
friends that Washington "denied me access (to the lot) my first time . . . he 
still denies my manager . . . access." 
</P>
<P>
Roth, who was dressed conservatively in a black vest, white cotton shirt and 
black-and-white checked pants and wore his usually wild mane in a simple 
ponytail, joked that Warner Bros. visitors are all nobodies until they've 
passed through Washington. "It's not that he has that much clout," he 
explained. "It's just that there's no other way to get in here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fondness for Washington 
</P>
<P>
Asked later why he agreed to serve as emcee, Roth expressed true fondness for 
Washington and remembered that the honoree "was my first contact with the big 
corporate empire of the music business. Howard's your first barometric reading 
when you get here." 
</P>
<P>
Roth told of one particular visit, arriving at the lot after 2 1/2 days in the 
desert where he developed "Just a Gigolo." The song became one of his biggest 
records as a solo artist after leaving the group Van Halen. 
</P>
<P>
"I drove in here, I hadn't changed clothes for 2 1/2 days and told Howard my 
idea for the song. He was the first person to hear it and he said, 'It'll be a 
hit,' " Roth recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Singers Randy Crawford and John Fogerty also were at the birthday party, which 
had been originally billed as a listening party for Roth, so Washington 
wouldn't suspect the hoopla was for him. 
</P>
<P>
Like Roth, Fogerty, the former lead singer of Creedence Clearwater Revival who 
signed with Warner Bros. when he became a solo artist, remembered that he 
repeatedly had to park on the street when he was visiting the record company at 
the time his "Centerfield" album was in the works. "He (Washington) didn't want 
to let on that he knew I was a big star," Fogerty remembered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Artists Know Him 
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps he just didn't know. Said Bob Merlis, head of the Warner Bros. 
public relations: "Most of the Warner artists know him even though he doesn't 
know who they are." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it seemed most everyone at the party not only knew Washington but at 
one time or other had to park on the street. Many employees were still 
consigned to the street. Thus, they presented Washington with his own framed, 
platinum record, titled "Howard Washington On the Lot." Among the cuts: "You 
Can't Park Here," "Park on the Street," "The Lot Is Full," "They Didn't Tell Me 
You Were Coming," and the long version of "I Don't Care Who You Are." Though he 
didn't say much from the stage except thank you, Washington sat down later and 
explained that his attitude toward stars and other big wigs is plainly 
egalitarian: "I treat them just like everybody else. I've been around stars. 
They're human like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Born July 15, 1909, in Norco, La., Washington said he was an only child who ran 
away from home at age 16 to come to Los Angeles. He began working at Warner 
Bros.' film studio in 1929, he added, providing a concession service of shoe 
shines and car washes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friend of Warner Family 
</P>
<P>
"I had people working for me," he remembered, noting that he became friends 
with members of the Warner family and was one of about 40 people invited to the 
funeral of co-founder Jack Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he encountered discrimination because of his color working either for 
the film studio or the record company, which he joined exclusively when the two 
firms' offices were separated, Washington replied: "Sure, there was 
discrimination, but I was treated as an equal. I know there was discrimination. 
I've seen it many times. But I've always been treated very nicely. . . . I was 
probably discriminated against, but in very subtle ways." 
</P>
<P>
In his years with Warner Bros., Washington has greeted stars from Joan Crawford 
to Bette Davis to Ronald Reagan, "when he was married to Jane Wyman." And he's 
tried a bit of everything. He worked briefly in the prop department. Served in 
the Navy in World War II. And had a small speaking part as a waiter in the 1951 
Hitchcock film "Strangers on a Train." 
</P>
<P>
In the '50s, Washington also went to real estate school and began buying and 
selling real estate, while still working at Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owns Buildings 
</P>
<P>
He now owns several buildings around town, including a 12-unit apartment 
complex on Slauson Avenue, though he still rents his own home in the West Adams 
district. Currently single, he has been married five times ("instead of 
shacking up, it was better in those days to get married") and has two sons, one 
deceased. 
</P>
<P>
A warm, gregarious man who looks more as though he's in his 50s or early 60s 
than his 80s, Washington attributed his good health and vitality to familiar 
precepts: "I do most everything -- in moderation. I believe in God. I live by 
the Commandments. I try to treat my fellow man right. And if I don't get along 
with you, I move on. I try to think right. You can live practically as long as 
you can move around if you think right. 
</P>
<P>
"And I keep myself having fun all the time. I work because I enjoy my job." 
</P>

Washington also has a good time off the job, as his girlfriend, Eunice Glover 
testified after the party. "I've known Howard for 30 years, intimately for the 
last four years," she said. "He's a very thoughtful person." 
</P>
<P>
But, after all these years tending cars on the parking lot, he still doesn't 
know much about them. "You'd think after a quarter of a century or so working 
on a parking lot, he'd know something about cars," declared Merlis. "His answer 
to everything is, 'Have you got jumper cables?' "

TO ZEALOTS, BEING FIRST DOES MATTER.

<P>
They pride themselves on being first. 
</P>
<P>
For some, it is the thrill of being at opening night. For others, it's the lead 
position in the ticket line to get there. Whatever the motivation, there is a 
certain number among us who would go to many lengths to say they were first to 
screen a movie premiere, or were there at a one-time-only concert, sold-out 
play or world championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Understand that these "firsts" don't take their business lightly. And being 
first to just any event generally won't do. The thrill lies in "being first to 
an event in history" -- as "firsts" like to say -- those once-in-a-lifetime 
experiences that can be treasured for years to come: "The Who" concert, the 
"Batman" premiere, "Phantom of the Opera," Lakers or Dodgers Championship 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the concept of being a part of something very large and very special," 
explains Cory Haibloom, 31, who was eighth in line at the "Batman" premiere in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel like a part of the celebration," says Tyrone Williams, 29, who went 
to the first two Lakers championship games this year and all of last year's 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
But why? 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the excitement comes from when you stand in the lines," says Williams, 
who adds that if he doesn't get to the line in time to be one of the first 10 
or 20, he passes. The excitement "builds from there until you see the game. 
Standing in line is like a kind of karma," he adds. "Everyone is in the same 
mood. It makes you feel like a part of the team. You just don't get that from 
TV." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Baltin, 32, has the same feeling about movie premieres. "Opening-day 
crowds are usually more excited, more fun. The people are true fans, just like 
you are. The audience is oftentimes as animated as the screen itself," says 
Baltin, who was another first-in-line at the "Batman" premiere. 
</P>
<P>
University of Southern California psychologist Chaytor Mason has a slightly 
more complex explanation for what motivates people to stand days in line for an 
event. 
</P>
<P>
He contends that "people are likely to wait in lines to be first because 
(there) they find others with similar interests ready to go the extra mile as 
well. Or there may be resentment for having to be lined up for things. 
Consequently," he explains, "they will stand up eight hours to be first in line 
so they won't have to stand in the line. 
</P>
<P>
"Even deeper . . . is the emotional aspect," Mason says. Sometimes, he notes, 
"people who feel in some way left out in life . . . have the need to experience 
something first to remedy" that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Free Movie 
</P>
<P>
But, then again, there are more practical reasons. "Seeing the movie for free," 
says Baltin, is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"You simply have to keep in touch with what's going on, when, where and what 
studios are previewing the upcoming movies," says Baltin, a seasoned 
professional who's already screened this summer's top 10 movies, free of 
charge. To do that, "It's very important to network with people," he explains. 
"It takes a little effort, but compared to the money I would pay to get into 
these movies with a date, it's worth it." He agrees it might be apt to compare 
"firsts" to coupon clippers -- people who are willing to spend considerable 
time keeping up with the coupon paper-chase to save a comparative few pennies. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it seems that time -- and not money -- is what "firsts" are willing to 
sacrifice. They are willing to spend countless hours, sometimes days, to 
achieve their goals. 
</P>
<P>
Baltin admits, "It takes a certain type of person to stand in a line for eight 
days," referring to his friend Jeff's weeklong camp-out at the Egyptian Theatre 
in May, 1983, for the opening of the movie "Return of the Jedi." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Kindred Spirit 
</P>
<P>
It was at "Jedi" that Richard's roommate, Cory Haibloom, met Jeff Krispow, 25, 
then a Cal State Northridge student. They have been lining up together ever 
since, often, they admit, placing first-string status ahead of jobs and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
"I took school off" the week "Jedi" came out, says Krispow, who only had a few 
weeks then before finals began. "It was worth the risk," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Baltin and others kid that Krispow is to blame for the eight-day line at the 
"Jedi" box office, complaining that he let his paranoia get the best of him. 
</P>
<P>
He started eight days ahead of show time, Krispow says, because "I wanted to be 
ahead of the woman who was first in line for 'Empire.' She stood out five days, 
and I was sure she would show," Krispow said. 
</P>
<P>
"Concerts are a little different" than movie premieres, acknowledges John Ryan, 
22, who was first in line at Ticketron in the Fallbrook Mall for the fall 1987 
Pink Floyd concert. 
</P>
<P>
"I waited in line for a day and a half. But I got the most incredible seats . . 
. the 14th row back. I mean if I sneezed I probably would have gotten David 
Gilmour right in the face. 
</P>
<P>
"You could look at it as time served versus the extra 40 or 100 dollars that I 
would have spent to get those kind of seats from a scalper," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Laker fan Williams agrees, saying, "they expect you to pay $400 more than the 
tickets are worth." To save money, he says, "I'll . . . do anything to make 
sure I'm one of the first in line." 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons for being first. 
</P>
<P>
Like the "critic-factor," explains Baltin. "Critics like Rex Reed, who I 
personally like very much, give three-fourths of the story plot away in their 
reviews. It takes the suspense out of the picture. It's better to beat them to 
the picture just to ensure the surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Theater "firsts" are even more meticulous. 
</P>
<P>
"Style is very important to the theatergoer," says Noah Alexander, who was one 
of the first in line March 20 at the Ahmanson box office for tickets to 
"Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrity Types 
</P>
<P>
"The type of people that you are likely to see when you get tickets to a 
Saturday night performance are celebrities," the fashion designer explains. 
"You get to see what they are wearing . . . and hear what they talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Is there a limit to the steps these fans are willing to take to be first? 
</P>
<P>
Alexander says "yes," but "I'm willing to defend my first place in line." 
</P>
<P>
He did that during his wait for "Phantom" tickets when, he says, a large group 
of people, sidestepping security guards and Ahmanson Theatre representatives, 
shoved their way to the front of the line through those who had been waiting 
patiently for hours. Alexander, who said he and others suspected the 
interlopers had been sent by ticket brokers and scalpers, found it necessary 
"to raise my voice and threaten management to let them know that it is their 
responsibility to keep things orderly." It was something, says the New York 
City native, that would never have happened on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a believer in lines," he continues, "because I feel genuinely when the box 
office opens, it's first-come first-served. I am making an investment in my 
time." 
</P>
<P>
It paid off two years ago when he lined up for tickets to "Les Miserables" at 
the Shubert Theatre. He was first in line at the box office, which got him four 
second-row orchestra tickets. 
</P>
<P>
About being first "you're talking about behavior patterns and styles," says 
Irene Goldenberg, a research psychiatrist at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric 
Institute. "I think that in some ways people focus around certain activities. 
It gives them . . . an organization for life." 
</P>
<P>
It also seems to be a sense of being in control that fuels the compulsion to be 
first. Some pride themselves on beating the odds, and in most cases that means 
beating the scalpers. And, they say, agencies like Ticket Masters often 
distribute tickets randomly, giving those first in line little, if any, 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
Can the desire to be first become a full-blown obsession? 
</P>
<P>
Says Mason: "Maybe, but on the other hand, it can be very rewarding. It goes 
back to the conviviality of meeting the same people at a similar activity . . . 
making it a social gathering. Then the people who like to be first look forward 
to meeting one another again." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan remembers his first "first" in 1977 when he was 10 years old and walked 
into the first showing of "Star Wars." "I wondered to myself, 'Why on earth are 
all of these people out here?' I guess that's where my compulsion started."

OCEANOGRAPHER BALLARD: HIS DISCOVERIES CONNECT SCIENCE WITH HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert D. Ballard headed up the discovery of two fabled sunken ships, the 
Titanic in 1985 and, just last month, the World War II German battleship 
Bismarck. In both cases, poignant reminders of human frailty persist on the 
dark, cold ocean floor, he says, lingering testaments to the dead, dragged far 
beyond air and light by plummeting hulks of steel and iron. 
</P>
<P>
Shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Pairs and pairs of shoes resting on the sea floor as if their owners had just 
stepped out of them. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'What was it like to go to the Titanic, particularly out in the 
debris area, the stern section where everyone died?' " Ballard recalls of the 
ocean liner that sank to a depth of 12,000 feet in the North Atlantic in 1912, 
killing 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew. "There are pairs of shoes all 
over there where people actually came to rest on the bottom of the ocean. Their 
shoes are still there. Shoes all over the Bismarck, boots all over the place. 
Animals won't eat processed leather. They eat the body and the clothes but they 
won't eat the leather." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanographer Ballard, in Los Angeles to announce that he will host a 
television series about underwater explorations and other scientific ventures, 
is somewhere in the middle of a long explanation about why he pursues the 
sunken past with such avidity. Partly, he concedes, it's for the sensations 
that only discovery can provide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Moment of Discovery 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thrill of exploration is to see something, to be the first to set 
eyes on something that has never been seen before," he says. "The first time I 
saw the Titanic, wow! There it was, this monstrous ship just came out of the 
gloom and there it was." 
</P>
<P>
For Ballard, the moment of discovery is intellectually kinetic -- an instant 
when he connects palpably with history. "The best experience that I can give 
that's sort of an analogy is like going to Custer's Last Stand," he says. "To 
go and stand where Custer stood and imagine, you know, bad day to be in the 
cavalry. That's the sense, it's your hallowed grounds. You sense Crazy Horse 
there . . . and you just realize the hopelessness of the situation. Well, when 
you're out at the Titanic and all of a sudden it happened right here. It's no 
longer abstract." 
</P>
<P>
Unknown territory, scientific and historic, has been Ballard's country for more 
than two decades, perhaps even as far back as his childhood in Southern 
California, when he was smitten by accounts of African exploration and became 
captivated by the Pacific Ocean. Now, four years after the discovery of the 
Titanic catapulted him from mere well-known scientist to global fame, the 
47-year-old seems to be in the throes of another transformation. This time 
around he apparently is eager to shape both the future and the past with the 
technology that he developed in more than a decade of underwater exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he plans to use his new tools as the new host of National 
Geographic Explorer, a weekly two-hour program produced by National Geographic 
and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. It is the kind of popularizing of science 
that Ballard has been criticized for in the past by his peers. But Ballard says 
he sees his metamorphosis into TV personality as an educational mission that 
may help convince children that science is a "contact sport." 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the search for the Bismarck, Ballard obviously savors the contact 
with history and science. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Bismarck was engaged in a running battle hundreds of miles from 
land when it sank, neither the British nor the Germans were able -- or much 
interested -- in keeping precise records of their locations. So Ballard's 
expedition had to search about 150 square miles of ocean floor, initially with 
sonar and then with remote control, computerized robot sensors and cameras 
controlled from a surface ship before locating the wreck June 8. (This kind of 
exploration isn't cheap, Ballard notes, joking that "we had 100,000 pounds of 
equipment and 10 vans and six robots and a partridge in a pear tree.") 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand that the Bismarck battle was waged in a Force 8 sea -- 
50-knot winds, 15-foot waves -- (with) overcast and no celestial navigation," 
Ballard says. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the Bismarck -- which, like the Titanic, sank on its maiden 
voyage -- was further complicated by the nature of the Atlantic Ocean. The 
battleship was in "16,000 feet of water and it was in a mountain range," 
Ballard says, not without enthusiasm. "It was in an awful place and it was in 
the northern latitudes, up at 48 degrees North latitude, which is not a nice 
stretch of ocean -- ever, even in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, Ballard was drawn to the wreck because, like the 
Titanic, it is one of the most famous lost chunks of history to litter the 
ocean floor. "I do it because of the challenge to do it," he says. "But I'm 
also interested in the fact that this ship is well preserved. . . . There is 
probably more history preserved in the deep oceans of the world than in all the 
museums of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Although it has lost its gun turrets and was hit by numerous shells and 
torpedoes, the Bismarck still has touches of freshness, Ballard adds, citing 
the "huge painted swastikas" on the ship's bow and stern. 
</P>
<P>
In its day, the 50,000-ton Bismarck, with heavy armor, eight 15-inch guns 
capable of firing one-ton shells 24 miles and high-performance diesel engines, 
was one of the most powerful warships afloat. And briefly it proved to be just 
that. Slipping out of its home port of Danzig (now Gdynia) on May 18, 1941 to 
attack Allied convoys, the Bismarck soon had much of the British Royal Navy 
looking for it. At the time England faced a victorious Germany alone and was 
dependent on convoys from America for most of its food and war material. 
Discovered by two British heavy cruisers 
</P>
<P>
on May 23, the Bismarck was engaged the next day by two other British warships. 
From a distance of 25,000 yards, the Bismarck's huge shells hit the Hood, 
starting a fire in an ammunition locker. Within minutes the Hood exploded, 
killing all but three of the ship's 1,400 crew members. The Prince of Wales was 
also damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Bismarck, "the British were lucky to get it to the bottom," Ballard 
claims. In the climactic battle, a "freak hit" by a torpedo launched from a 
vintage World War I biplane knocked out the Bismarck's steering, forcing the 
crippled battleship to "wait for the British to come and get it." Of course, 
the British came and the Bismarck was sunk in the Atlantic about 600 miles west 
of France. 
</P>
<P>
Since the discovery of the Bismarck, Ballard says there has been curiosity 
about what actually caused the ship to sink -- British firepower or scuttling 
by her own crew. But Ballard believes the evidence makes the point moot. The 
British warships had orders to sink the Bismarck, not capture it, and the 
Germans were under orders not to let the pride of their fleet be taken as a war 
prize, he says. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m. on May 27, the captain of the Bismarck ordered his crew to open the 
seacocks on his disabled ship, thus flooding the hull, Ballard recounts. About 
10:30 a.m., the Bismarck was hit by three torpedoes from the British cruiser 
Dorsetshire and sank three minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bismarck's Survivors 
</P>
<P>
"So it was on its way down and the torpedoes helped -- but it was on its way 
down," Ballard says. "If they hadn't opened the seacocks, I'm convinced the 
British would have sat there and plunked torpedoes into it until it sank. So 
it's sort of academic who sank it." Only about 100 of the Bismarck's crew 
survived. Nearly 2,300 perished, including several hundred who were swimming in 
the water after their ship disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
It is that moment that seems to galvanize Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Bismarck sank, approximately 800 living souls went into the water and 
were alive after the ship went under," he says, leaning forward in his chair. 
"And the Dorsetshire came in and began picking up survivors and then someone 
thought they saw a periscope and they took off and they left 700 people in the 
water alive. . . . Can you imagine the awfulness, the hopelessness, the despair 
of the sailor who's just had a ship blown out from underneath him? He's 
paddling and freezing to death in this water and salvation is right there and 
he's grabbing hold of the hull and the ship takes off." 
</P>
<P>
Ballard has said he will not reveal the exact location of the Bismarck except 
to German authorities. As a ship of war, the battleship belongs to Germany, he 
says, although there might be some debate about which half of that divided 
country would have the more legitimate claim. 
</P>
<P>
As with the Titanic, Ballard says he strongly believes that such relatively 
recent wrecks should be left undisturbed, memorials to those who perished. As 
for wrecks from the dim reaches of the past, Ballard argues that they should be 
explored only by qualified archeologists intent on broadening historical 
knowledge. In fact, he still becomes visibly angry that private expeditions to 
the Titanic took some artifacts from the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developed Deep-Sea Robots 
</P>
<P>
But Ballard seems to be chiefly an enthusiast, not a critic. In particular he 
is a proponent of machines, especially robots. Ballard has headed up the 
development of a system of deep-sea unmanned robots -- called the Argo-Jason 
system. Equipped with cameras and other sensing devices, the robots are now 
capable of plumbing the world's deep waters faster and more safely than the 
tiny, slow, manned submarines that previously were the cutting edge of ocean 
research and exploration, he says. 
</P>
<P>
While an unmanned robot named Jason Jr. was used in a 1986 expedition to the 
Titanic, it was only within the last few months that the leap was made "to 
fully robotic exploration," Ballard says, meaning that robots can now be 
directed from a surface ship rather than from a manned submarine via a control 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
It's a relief that he and others won't have to spend five or more hours per day 
"commuting" to the ocean floor, which averages 12,000 feet in depth, he says. 
Even though he has spent a lot of time in cramped research submarines and 
probably will spend more, Ballard is miffed by the inefficiency of the 
"romantic little guys," referring to the small submarines. 
</P>
<P>
He explains: ". . . you're spending five hours a day freezing to death in this 
little sphere. Our average dive time on the Titanic was three hours a day. 
Three hours out of 24 and you've got 50 people and you've got one guy looking 
out of a window." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Interest in Science 
</P>
<P>
Ballard has been talking about the potential of this technology for years. But 
recent advances have made him more convinced than ever that the concept of 
"telepresence" will revolutionize not only undersea exploration but the way 
many people "travel." More important, he sees the technology as capable of 
rekindling interest in science among American schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now reaching a point in technology, in imaging devices both acoustic and 
visual, fiber optic transmission links, digital enhancement, computer 
manipulation, robotics etc, etc. to simulate presence," he says in a gee-whiz 
way. "In fact many of us in the technology believe it will become a pervasive 
way of people living their lives. In other words, ultimately you won't travel 
that much. You'll travel in a telepresence way. We can have this conversation 
half a world apart and you'll sense my presence, I'll sense yours. . . . The 
idea of the Argo-Jason system is to put you in a room and convince you you're 
in a submarine looking out a bunch of windows" that are in fact video monitors 
displaying scenes picked up by robot-mounted cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard, whose professional base is the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on 
Massachusetts' Cape Cod, is such a believer in the concept of telepresence that 
he's already using it to change the way he lives. He recently built a house 
near Montana's Glacier National Park in which he is installing a satellite 
antenna so that he can bounce his image and voice into space and back to Earth 
for professional meetings and conversations with people far, far away. His goal 
is "to create a place where I don't feel professionally inconvenienced by 
living in Montana." 
</P>
<P>
How much time he actually will spend in northern Montana is an open question, 
though, given the demands of the Explorer television series. 
</P>
<P>
With the series, including a program on the Bismarck to be broadcast in late 
October, Ballard asserts that he can do his bit to instill a respect for the 
past and take millions on magical mystery tours of the kingdoms under the sea. 
</P>
<P>
". . . 70% of the planet's under water. We've seen less than .1% of 1%. I mean 
we know more about the mountain ranges on Mars than the mountain ranges of our 
own planet," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Vast Unknown 
</P>
<P>
It is this sense of the vast unknown here on Earth that he wants to 
communicate. 
</P>
<P>
"To me the concept of an explorer has been somewhat diminished," he says. 
"People now retrace Hannibal's route in a Winnebago or they walk backwards to 
the North Pole. It's sort of become a Guinness Book of World Records type of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
And he says he wants to do his part to protect good old people-friendly dry 
land too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important right now to realize that the Earth is in jeopardy and 
we're the first generation that can kill it and we're killing it," he says, 
leaving the battles of World War II far behind. ". . . This baloney about 
living in space is baloney. You send everyone else out there and give me 
Montana. I have no desire to live underwater. I've seen the place."

BUSH UPBEAT, WARY ON SOVIET ECONOMIC BID 
</P>

<P>
President Bush offered an upbeat response Sunday to what he called Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's "fascinating" appeal for Western help for his 
effort to overhaul his Communist economy. 
</P>
<P>
But in a note of caution, Bush said that the recent sharp improvements in 
superpower relations do not mean that "everything is hunky-dory between the 
East and West." 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference at the end of the annual summit conference of seven 
leading industrial democracies, the President also said he sees no immediate 
prospect that the Soviet Union will join the economic summit meetings any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets would first have to transform their economy to capitalism and their 
political system to democracy, Bush told reporters who had assembled in the 
leafy, sunny garden of the U.S. ambassador's residence here. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an awful lot that has to transpire in the Soviet Union, it seems to 
me, before anything of that nature would be considered," the President added. 
"We're talking about free-market economies here. There was no . . . indication 
that he will be attending the next summit." 
</P>
<P>
He also said it would require "a little more time" before he would hold his own 
summit with Gorbachev. White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said earlier 
on NBC's "Meet the Press" that such a summit would probably be held between the 
end of this year and early next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev dominated the 15th annual economic summit merely by sending a letter 
Saturday to French President Francois Mitterrand, the summit's host, in which 
he promised to end the Soviet Union's historic isolation from the world economy 
and asked for Western help for his effort. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the letter, which prompted "a great deal of discussion" at the 
summit, will be given "a very courteous and very thoughtful reply" by 
Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether anyone at the summit thought Gorbachev was attempting to make 
"mischief" by upstaging the proceedings, Bush replied: "I can't say that that 
(thought) never occurred." But he said no one was prepared to say that mischief 
was indeed Gorbachev's goal. 
</P>
<P>
The President said the summit leaders concluded that the letter "was just one 
more manifestation of the changing world we're living it -- that I think was 
the main message." 
</P>
<P>
"They're moving toward our open system, our free system, our system of free 
elections," the President said. "And that's the way I would look at the letter. 
. . . It was saying, let's do something in a common way about solving problems 
around the world." 
</P>
<P>
The President also reacted warmly to Gorbachev's expressed goal of a "common 
home" for all Europeans, although he said that achieving the goal is a long way 
off. U.S. officials have previously responded more cautiously, out of concern 
that Gorbachev's proposal left no room for the United States and the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the seven summit nations, which agreed Saturday to take concerted 
action to assist Poland, Hungary and other East European nations that take 
steps toward capitalism and democracy, should encourage similar changes in the 
Soviet Union, "to the degree the Soviets would not consider that an 
intervention into their internal affairs." 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet economy needs a lot of work," the President declared. "And I say 
that not to be critical, but certainly that's an objective judgment. The 
economy is in bad, bad shape -- far worse shape than the Western economies." 
</P>
<P>
The President sidestepped a question on whether the Cold War had ended, saying: 
"I don't like to use 'Cold War.' That has a connotation of worse days in terms 
of (the) East-West relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet I don't want to stand here and seem euphoric that everything is hunky-dory 
between the East and West, on arms or on differences in the economy or on how 
we look at regional problems. We have some big differences still." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Popularity Contest 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he avoided declaring a winner at this year's summit, his first. He 
said such questions sound like "who's more popular, who's ahead in the poll -- 
Bush or Gorbachev -- in Eastern Europe or Connecticut. And it doesn't really 
have much to do with that." 
</P>
<P>
Later, escorting reporters on a tour of the ambassadorial residence, his 
quarters in Paris, Bush cracked playfully that as for a popularity contest with 
the Soviet leader in Connecticut, the state where he was raised, "I'd hate to 
put it to the test." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said at the news conference that he was "kind of running out of gas" after 
a week in which he also visited Poland and Hungary. He is scheduled to stop in 
the Netherlands today before returning to Washington on Tuesday, and he 
expressed no regret that the summit ended at midday Sunday, half a day earlier 
than scheduled, because all of the agenda items had been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the leaders couldn't have found anything else to consider, the 
65-year-old Bush cited his fatigue and said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a vigorous experience in physical fitness for me, and I try to stay 
in pretty good shape. But when you couple the summit with the (French) 
bicentennial and then tack on Poland and Hungary, I wasn't about to argue we 
needed more time, nor was anyone else."

SUMMIT STRESSES ECOLOGICAL THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
CONCERTED ACTION URGED AS PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO ENVIRONMENT FOR FIRST TIME

<P>
Leaders of the world's seven largest industrial democracies ended their annual 
economic summit here Sunday with a call for concerted action in a new area of 
concern -- the growing threat to the global environment. 
</P>
<P>
After 2 1/2 days of meetings, the seven -- President Bush and the leaders of 
West Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- issued a formal 
communique that for the first time made the environment a top political 
priority internationally. 
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed their current policies on a spate of global economic 
issues, ranging from the reduction of trade imbalances in the major industrial 
countries to the proper value for the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand, host of both the summit and a companion 
celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, said at a 
closing press conference that the session produced "an excellent climate for 
the exchange of views." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, echoing those sentiments, called the summit session "a clear success" and 
added, "I am satisfied that the summit has accomplished its goals." 
</P>
<P>
The final communique warned of "an urgent need to safeguard the environment for 
future generations" and asserted that protecting it "calls for a determined and 
concerted international response" and "the early adoption, worldwide," of 
sustainable policies to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups, which sent unofficial representatives to keep tabs on the 
summit action, hailed the fact that the ecological issue was at last put on the 
agenda but expressed disappointment that the communique offered few specific 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Rafe Pomerance, a senior associate of the World Resources Institute, a 
Washington-based research group, said the seven leaders "failed to propose the 
decisive actions necessary to confront the deteriorating (global) trends." 
</P>
<P>
But Bush, at his end-of-summit press conference, dismissed such criticism as 
missing the main point -- that the summit for the first time brought 
environmental issues to the fore. "They didn't think I took decisive actions 
when I sent the clean air bill up to Congress," he complained. 
</P>
<P>
In their communique, the summit leaders: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Called for a speedup in preparations for a previously planned international 
convention designed to hammer out guidelines for dealing with the threat of 
global warming caused by the so-called greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed for the first time on the need to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, 
which cause the greenhouse effect, and called for stepped-up monitoring and 
exchange of information worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reiterated their support for a 1987 international agreement to help stem 
the depletion of the atmosphere's ozone layer by eliminating the use of 
chlorofluorocarbons by the end of the century and vowed to expand their efforts 
to include substances not covered by the 1987 accord. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pledged to increase their financial support for the U.N. Environment 
Program, the only major international agency that deals in this field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
West German Proposals 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the group sidestepped more sweeping action on the 
environment, including proposals by West Germany to call a major new conference 
on the world climatic issue and to establish a powerful new international 
organization to regulate pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The economic section of the communique was even less ambitious than the portion 
on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Pronouncing themselves satisfied with the state of the world economy, the seven 
leaders essentially reaffirmed their current policies on issues such as trade, 
the dollar and developing country debt. They strongly endorsed the Third World 
debt-reduction strategy proposed last March 10 by U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
They also pointedly urged Mexico and its creditor banks to complete an accord 
on refinancing of that country's foreign debt. They warned that governments 
would not be providing additional funds if the negotiations failed. 
</P>
<P>
Top officials of the United States and several other countries had hoped that 
the Mexican debt talks, which continued through the weekend in New York, could 
have been concluded in time for the summit. The Bush Administration wants to 
use the Mexican case as the showpiece of the Brady debt plan. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial nations essentially sidestepped potential disputes over how to 
deal with the resurgence of inflation in some countries, such as Britain, West 
Germany and Japan. They had little new to say about the continuing U.S. trade 
deficit and corresponding surpluses in West Germany and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters later, Brady reiterated the Administration's contention 
-- apparently supported by the other governments -- that with the U.S. economy 
continuing to move along nicely, there was no point in fixing something "if 
it's not broke." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Recession 
</P>
<P>
However, Bush conceded at his press conference that he sometimes worries that 
the U.S. economy may be "stalling" and could be heading toward a recession. 
Some analysts have interpreted recent economic figures as raising that 
possibility, although most still believe that growth will only slow moderately. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's communique pledged two other actions that the seven leaders said they 
thought would prove important. 
</P>
<P>
It set up an international task force to probe ways to crack down on money 
laundering, which the seven countries regard as a major element in financing 
drug trafficking around the world. The group, to be known as the Financial 
Action Task Force, is scheduled to issue recommendations by next April. 
</P>
<P>
And it called for more vigorous international cooperation to rein in insider 
trading in stock markets, such as the kind that brought down Wall Street 
kingpin Ivan F. Boesky. U.S. officials said the leaders were worried that the 
credibility of international financial markets would suffer if offenders were 
not brought into line. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to spotlight environmental issues was substantial by any measure. A 
full 10 pages of the 22-page communique dealt with environmental issues. By 
contrast, at last year's summit, such issues barely received a paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
The move stemmed from increased political pressure by environmentalists in 
virtually all of the summit countries -- particularly West Germany, where the 
Greens party has done well in recent elections -- and by new interest from 
Bush, who has pledged to become "the environmental President."

SOVIET MINERS' STRIKE GROWS; 100,000 JOIN IN 
</P>

<P>
A weeklong strike by Soviet coal miners demanding better supplies of food, 
safer working conditions, more housing and an environmental cleanup around 
their mines in western Siberia grew to about 100,000 workers on Sunday and 
threatened to turn into a general strike there. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the mines in the Kuznetsky Basin, the Soviet Union's 
second-largest coal producing region, are now closed, officials said, and the 
strike has spread quickly from Mezhdurechensk to nine other towns in the 
region, becoming a major political and economic challenge to the country's 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the region, known as the Kuzbass, as a "raging basin" with "only a 
few small islands of tranquillity," the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said 
that more than 80,000 workers have joined the strike. The trade union newspaper 
Trud put the number in a later report at 100,000, and Radio Moscow reported an 
even higher figure. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the original strikers have resumed work, coal shipments out of 
the area have been halted and dozens of other enterprises closed by local trade 
union leaders in an effort to force a showdown with the central government. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts by government and Communist Party officials to calm the situation and 
restore production have so far failed. Thousands of miners are occupying the 
central squares in the towns hit by the strike, Soviet newspapers reported 
Sunday, although order is being maintained by patrols of workers as well as 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine the impact -- all the pits and mines are on strike and most of 
the other major enterprises have joined them," Valery Legachev, a member of the 
strike committee in Prokopyevsk, one of the striking towns, said Sunday. "The 
place is shut down." 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail I. Shchadov, the coal minister, spoke to tens of thousands of miners in 
an evening rally in Prokopyevsk on Saturday, but afterward the strike grew as 
miners demanded that more senior officials come to negotiate with them. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is changing from hour to hour, and mines that were peaceful 
yesterday stopped working unexpectedly today," the newspaper Soviet Russia 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political, Economic Problem 
</P>
<P>
As it continues to grow, the strike poses both a political and an economic 
challenge to the government and the Communist Party leadership under President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The demands of the strikers are largely that the leadership honor the promises 
that Gorbachev has made -- promises not only of better living conditions but 
also of greater democracy and of worker control over the enterprises where they 
are employed. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the work stoppage, one of the largest in the Soviet Union in 
recent years, threatens to shut down major segments of the country's industry 
-- notably iron smelters, steel mills, thermal power plants and all the 
factories that depend upon them for materials or energy -- by depriving them of 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Already, more than 1 million tons of coal production have been lost, according 
to Pravda. The monetary value, about $31 million, is of less importance, the 
paper said, than the effect of the lost production on other industries. The 
government is battling for economic growth in order to underwrite its reform 
program, and these losses could have a severe impact. 
</P>
<P>
The central demand of the strikers is for local administration of the mines -- 
with strong worker participation -- under new industrial and labor laws adopted 
in recent years as part of Gorbachev's broader economic reforms, known as 
perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
This would give miners the right, under government-set guidelines and overall 
economic plans, to manage the mines, set production goals and use their 
revenues in accordance with local priorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Break With Policy 
</P>
<P>
But it would also be a major break -- and in a key industry -- from the Soviet 
Union's centrally planned and managed economy, whose Moscow-based 
administrators remain firmly entrenched four years into Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yevsyukov, chairman of the regional miners' strike committee, told Pravda 
that "the strikers' demands come down essentially to granting miners' 
collectives the real right to control their enterprises' destiny and to dispose 
of the coal produced by their hard labor." 
</P>
<P>
Yevsyukov said that the miners want to use the coal they produce above the 
governmental quotas to conclude barter deals for consumer goods and, if it is 
exported, to use foreign currency earned for the social needs of the city and 
region. 
</P>
<P>
In Prokopyevsk, Legachev also said that the key issue is local worker control 
of the mines. The workers would set their own production schedules to meet 
government orders but would be free to sell above-plan production and use the 
money, including highly prized foreign exchange, as they wished. 
</P>
<P>
Other demands include more environmental protection, lower prices at canteens 
and stores operated by the mines for their workers, better housing and 
recreational facilities, improved working conditions and higher salaries for 
medical workers. They also want elections for new local governments. 
</P>
<P>
Among the key environmental issues raised has been a sharp reduction in 
open-pit mining, which has devasted the local landscape, the faster reclamation 
of this land and its development for agriculture. The miners are also demanding 
that the government drop plans to build a slurry line to carry coal from the 
area, contending that the region is already short of water. 
</P>
<P>
But efforts by a dissident group, the Democratic Union, to give a further 
political cast to the strike failed, according to Trud, when the group's 
organizers were shouted down at strike rallies. According to Trud, the miners 
declared their loyalty to the Communist Party and their support of socialism -- 
as well as their determination to make the system more responsive and 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
In Kiselevsk, 17 non-mining enterprises struck in support of the miners, 
according to Legachev, and the strike seems to be spreading to other industries 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newspaper Voices Support 
</P>
<P>
The strike drew unexpected support on this aspect from the conservative 
newspaper Soviet Russia. "The further the Kuzbass strike goes, the clearer the 
step forward becomes," the newspaper said Sunday. "Until recently, perestroika 
has been a 'revolution from above,' but now it is getting strong support from 
below." 
</P>
<P>
The demand of the miners for economic independence was, in fact, promised to 
them in Gorbachev's most basic reforms, the newspaper said, asking with a hint 
of mischief, "Is this not the essence and goal of perestroika?" 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Melnikov, the first secretary of the Communist Party's regional 
committee, also described the miners' strike as part of the process of 
perestroika, involving "the popular masses in the solution of acute problems." 
</P>
<P>
But Melnikov argued that the form of the protests -- the work stoppages and the 
resulting economic losses -- will inevitably damage economic expansion and thus 
mean a setback for perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
In its analysis, Soviet Russia countered that the workers had been raising 
these problems for years and that the governmental leaders had ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who did not heed them, who were afraid of or unwilling to start a 
dialogue with them on equal terms, who were slow in putting into life a program 
of transformations as outlined by the party or in resolving specific problems 
and meeting people's demands, are much more to blame for what has happened," 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the forces that drove the Kuzbass workers to a strike and whom we 
call, and with good reason, the anti-perestroika forces."

<P>
At the economic summit that ended here Sunday, as in his visit to Poland and 
Hungary that immediately preceded it, President Bush remarked pointedly several 
times that he was speaking from the heart, not from note cards. 
</P>
<P>
The contrast with his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, who routinely read from cards 
during his highly scripted presidency, was obvious. In his first meeting with 
the heads of the six other leading industrial democracies, Bush clearly 
established himself as the vigorous and forceful President of the largest 
democracy of all. 
</P>
<P>
The reviews were boffo. French President Francois Mitterrand praised Bush as "a 
man of great openness and great courtesy in personal relations." Mitterrand, 
who attended eight summits with Reagan, said Bush "showed a desire to achieve 
good understanding" of issues. 
</P>
<P>
Milan's conservative daily Il Giornale declared: "Bush earned his stripes as 
the leader of the Free World." Tokyo's mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun noted 
that Bush had made the summit focus on Eastern Europe. In Paris, French TV-1 
called the proposal on Eastern Europe "an unprecedented initiative." 
</P>
<P>
As Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark noted, however, Bush's success hinged in 
part on the fact that his wish list for the 1989 summit was so modest. 
</P>
<P>
The President displayed the same instinct for conciliation and compromise that 
has marked the first six months of his tenure on domestic issues. But just as 
in Washington, he has purchased consensus by trimming back some of his goals. 
</P>
<P>
At several earlier summits, the United States went to the table with major 
demands -- and usually won them. In 1978, Jimmy Carter pressured reluctant West 
Germany and Japan into stimulating their economies to boost their purchases of 
U.S. exports. And in 1986, Reagan won the summit's strong condemnation of 
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi and a joint commitment to work harder against 
state-sponsored terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Bush had a more limited agenda, and he stopped short of pressing for 
everything on it. On Eastern Europe, his most heartfelt issue, he sought a 
clear commitment from West Germany and Japan to increase their aid to Poland 
and Hungary -- but when West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl pressed to restrict 
the action to a call for a meeting of experts, Bush quickly agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praise From Diplomats 
</P>
<P>
Modest as his agenda may have been, Bush's performance was generally praised by 
other diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
Several said they were impressed by Bush's knowledge of foreign affairs and his 
low-key and relaxed style of dealing with other leaders. They implied that they 
found Bush a welcome contrast to Reagan, who during eight summits was never 
regarded as especially knowledgeable in foreign affairs and was considered 
formal and rather aggressive in pushing his own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
After watching Bush in action here, a French diplomat turned to a senior State 
Department official and said, "It's nice to have a summit where all the leaders 
can read and write." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan came into office with virtually no experience in foreign affairs, while 
Bush has had years of experience in a variety of top federal posts involving 
international issues. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Reagan showed little interest in discussing foreign affairs with other 
leaders. By contrast, diplomats found Bush to be a good listener who was 
willing to engage in in-depth discussions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enjoys Give and Take 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Reagan, who pretty much stuck to the script written by his aides for 
formal discussions, Bush enjoys the give and take of less structured settings 
at sessions such as the economic summit. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to himself in his Sunday press conference as "the new boy, the new 
kid in school," Bush said that what he found most interesting at the summit was 
"the unstructured part, the part where you sit with these other leaders, tell 
them what you think, listen carefully to what they think." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating the kind of self-assuredness that impressed diplomats here, he 
said he would like to see more emphasis placed on "that kind of interaction" in 
the future. Next year's summit is scheduled to be held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Ties Help 
</P>
<P>
Personal ties to many members of diplomatic delegations here who are longtime 
friends or acquaintances of Bush -- dating back to his days as U.N. ambassador, 
envoy to China, CIA director and vice president -- also have played a crucial 
role in his diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
At a reception here, Michele Legendre, wife of French Premier Michel Rocard, 
rushed up to Walter J. P. Curley, the U.S. ambassador to France and himself a 
friend of Bush's for many years, and asked where she would be able to see the 
President; "He's a friend of mine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel very comfortable with him," said Curley. "He has a penchant for 
making friends." 
</P>
<P>
Another Bush acquaintance, Canada's Clark, said: "President Bush performed to 
great effect. This is his first summit, but it was far from being his first 
exposure to foreign affairs. He comes as close to (being) an expert as you can 
get." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's relaxed style apparently contributed to a lack of the tension that has 
marred some previous summits. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the summit issued a major statement on the need for 
international cooperation in protecting the environment, a subject that 
apparently held little interest for Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
For Bush, by contrast, the environment has long been a subject of major 
interest. Said Clark: "It's clear that Mr. Bush is more inclined to cooperate 
with the other leaders on the environmental question."

Norway said Sunday that a fire had broken out aboard a Soviet nuclear-powered 
submarine, but Norwegian radio quoted a Soviet official as saying the reported 
blaze was part of a military exercise. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third incident involving Moscow's underwater fleet in the area in 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
The Oslo Defense Ministry said a Norwegian vessel had spotted the Soviet 
Alpha-class attack submarine on the surface, smoke billowing from its conning 
tower and under tow by a Soviet vessel Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of Exercise 
</P>
<P>
But the Moscow correspondent of Norwegian radio NRK quoted a Soviet official as 
saying that the reported fire on board the submarine, which was off northern 
Norway, was part of a military exercise and that there had been no accident. 
</P>
<P>
NRK Moscow correspondent Arnt Stefansen said he had been given the information 
by a spokesman at the headquarters of the Sea Rescue Center in Moscow. Quoting 
the spokesman verbatim, Stefansen said in a radio report: 
</P>
<P>
"A certain amount of smoke was created in the area, in connection with a 
military exercise. . . . It is a misunderstanding that there has been an 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet spokesman, identified by Stefansen as Capt. Alexander Dilitsin, said 
the submarine was on its way to port on the Kola Peninsula under its own power 
and that the situation on board was normal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Visible Damage 
</P>
<P>
Norwegian television showed film taken from a plane flying over the submarine. 
There was no smoke or visible damage and the vessel was moving quickly under 
its own power on the surface. The sea was calm and the weather clear. 
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg seemed skeptical about the 
Soviet claim that no accident had occurred and was angry that Oslo had not been 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem that way to us," he told state television. 
</P>
<P>
"I am bound to say that, whether it was an exercise or not, it would have been 
useful to inform us," he said after summoning Moscow's ambassador to protest 
about the lack of a warning. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Ambassador Alexander Teterin said he had no information about the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
There have been two major accidents involving Soviet submarines off Norway in 
the last four months. 
</P>
<P>
In June, a Soviet Echo 2-class nuclear-powered submarine caught fire off 
Norway. Oslo complained that Moscow had failed to inform it of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a Soviet Mike-class nuclear submarine caught fire and sank in the 
Norwegian sea, killing 42 crew members.

SHAMIR OFFERS ASSURANCES ON PEACE PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
HE SAYS HIS INITIATIVE IS INTACT, BUT CABINET RIVALS DEMAND VOTE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saying that his initiative for peace in the occupied territories remains 
intact, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir uttered key words Sunday meant to keep 
his shaky coalition together, but his rivals demanded a new, formal vote on the 
original plan. 
</P>
<P>
According to an official account of the weekly Cabinet meeting, Shamir took 
rehearsed questions from ministers and gave the answer: "The peace initiative 
is unchanged and the government will continue to act in accordance with it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coalition Threatened 
</P>
<P>
The assurance was aimed at placating the Labor Party, led by Finance Minister 
Shimon Peres, whose members have threatened to leave the ruling partnership if 
Shamir subjects the plan to limitations demanded by a resolution adopted by his 
Likud Party. The objective of the plan is to allow Palestinians in the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip to choose a peace delegation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed on a governmental initiative which we felt should be defined in 
a way to attract an Arab side. Our argument is that there is a contradiction 
which exists between the government of Israel plan and the Likud resolution. We 
are trying to see where we stand on this contradiction," Peres said. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir offered to let the Cabinet vote on his verbal pronouncement, but Peres 
and his allies held out for a new, written text and a vote to guarantee that 
the proposal as originally advanced by Shamir is still valid. The plan was 
adopted by the government May 14. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict began after Likud placed limits on the plan earlier this month. 
Under no circumstances must Israel give up land on the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, the party's resolution said. It also specified that the Arab 
uprising must end before any election to choose peace negotiators takes place, 
and Arabs who live in East Jerusalem would not be permitted to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Likud Party hawks were silent Sunday, evidently put on the defensive by 
Shamir's insistence that the May 14 plan takes precedence over his own party's 
policy -- one that he had endorsed when it was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid a confrontation with Likud, Shamir is resisting a new Cabinet vote on 
the plan. The Cabinet originally adopted the measure 20 to 6. "It is not 
necessary to have another vote," said Yosef Ben-Aharon, a top Shamir aide. "The 
decision has been made to proceed -- and that is that." 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Aharon went on to argue that the greatest obstacle to getting the peace 
plan on track is not Israel's political maneuverings but continued talks 
between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Aharon said Shamir's plan and Washington's dialogue with the PLO are 
"mutually exclusive." The United States cannot profess to support Shamir's plan 
and yet keep talking with the PLO, he insisted. Israel's plan precludes 
participation by the PLO in elections or subsequent talks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting to the moment of truth. We are not going to accept talks with 
the PLO, we are not going to accept indirect negotiations with the PLO through 
Washington," Ben-Aharon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to work with Palestinians here to have elections. The talks with the 
PLO undermine that effort." 
</P>
<P>
The Shamir government has steadily campaigned to end the talks between the Bush 
Administration and the PLO, which it considers an unrepentant terrorist 
organization. Once the PLO is let in on talks, Israeli officials assert, the 
formation of a Palestinian state next to Israel is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Ben-Aharon's comments came in the wake of hints from Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III, who said that if Shamir's elections proposal falls through, the 
United States might lean toward the option of holding an international 
conference on the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Such a conference has been a goal of the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trip Canceled 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration canceled plans to send a top State Department delegate 
to Israel this week to determine whether Shamir was still standing firm on his 
original plan, in the face of attacks on it from Likud. U.S. officials said 
that because Shamir was giving assurances that his initiative remained 
unchanged, it was unnecessary to send such a delegate. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in the prime minister's office and in the Labor Party said that Labor 
Party officials had feared that such a trip would be seen as pressure on its 
behalf.

ETHNIC STRIFE SPARKED BY UNIVERSITY PLAN LEAVES 11 DEAD IN SOVIET GEORGIAN 
RESORT 
</P>

<P>
Ethnic violence, which President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has warned threatens the 
very existence of his reform policies, has left 11 people dead and 120 injured 
in a Black Sea resort city, Soviet media reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The overnight clashes in Sukhumi, capital of the autonomous Abkhazia enclave in 
the republic of Soviet Georgia, were over a plan to open a branch of a Georgian 
university in the city and restrict the Abkhazian enrollment, according to the 
official Tass news agency and local reports. 
</P>
<P>
Abkhazians bitterly oppose the proposal, and fighting between Georgians and 
Abkhazians broke out Saturday night and continued until morning in several 
parts of the coastal city, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stones and Firearms' 
</P>
<P>
"Those involved in the fighting used stones, clubs, knives and firearms. 
According to the information we have, 11 people were killed and 127 
hospitalized," Tass reported, without elaborating on the nationalities of those 
killed and injured. 
</P>
<P>
The fatalities in the city brought to more than 100 the number of people killed 
in the last year and a half in ethnic clashes in Georgia, Armenia and 
Azerbaijan, which make up the southern Caucasus. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions among some of the Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities have 
heightened since Gorbachev took office in March, 1985. His policy of permitting 
greater openness in Soviet society spurred first verbal complaints, then 
demonstrations and sometimes violence among some minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Political conservatives have contended that the inter-ethnic violence is a sign 
that the new openness has gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
For Gorbachev, maintaining national cohesion in this vast country has become a 
major challenge. In a special speech to the nation broadcast on television two 
weeks ago, he appealed for minorities to voice their complaints calmly, warning 
that ethnic friction could tear the country apart and strangle his program to 
reform Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
In Soviet Georgia, tensions have been high for several months. The Muslim 
Abkhazians, who make up less than one-quarter of their autonomous region's 
population of more than 525,000, contend that the Christian Georgians are 
trying to put an end to their culture and language. 
</P>
<P>
They have demanded that their tiny enclave in the northwest of the republic be 
allowed to separate from Georgia and form an independent Abkhazian republic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Protests 
</P>
<P>
Georgian anger at Abkhazian secessionist demands contributed to nationalistic 
protests in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in April. Red Army troops broke up 
the protests, killing 20 people. Public outrage over the deaths led to the 
removal of the local Communist Party chief. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Sukhumi, founded by the Greeks in the 6th Century BC, is 
overcrowded this time of year, because it is a popular summer tourist site for 
Soviets. That simply adds to official concern over the tensions there. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said Interior Ministry troops had been sent to the city to help restore 
calm, and the Georgian party leaders, including the republic's party chief, 
also rushed to the autonomous region. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders "called on the population to display wisdom, common sense and 
high responsibility and help . . . stabilize the situation," said the Tass 
report, which was read on the evening television news program "Vremya." 
</P>
<P>
In other ethnic clashes over the weekend, Soviet security forces shot and 
wounded two people and a police officer was wounded by gunfire in two separate 
incidents in Tadzhikistan, according to reports Sunday in the Communist Party 
daily Pravda and Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist Party youth newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The woundings came after clashes Thursday near the border between Tadzhikistan 
and Kirghizia left one dead and 18 injured. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute is over rights to a water canal used by farmers on both sides of 
the border, Pravda said. Three border villages were reported under curfew.

WWII BOMB FOUND NEAR AIR BASE, DETONATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rusted but live World War II-vintage bomb was discovered and later detonated 
on the outskirts of Edwards Air Force Base this weekend, authorities said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A motorcyclist riding through the desert near Palmdale on Friday found the 
12-inch bomb. It formed a 60-square-foot crater and a 300-foot plume of smoke 
when detonated Saturday by a U.S. Army team from San Diego, Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Handley said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion was miles away from any development, Handley said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the photoflash bomb weighed about 150 pounds. Designed to light up the 
sky during night attacks, it was sticking about eight inches out of the sand, 
said Air Force Lt. Col. Jan Dalby. 
</P>
<P>
Handley said the bomb was found near an area once used as a bombing range about 
a quarter-mile south of the base boundary near Avenue A and 200th Street.

NO SURE WINNER LOOMS IN CROWDED 76TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ordinarily, a state legislative candidate who receives only 10% of the 
potential vote would not need to concern himself with housing prices in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
However, under the peculiar political mathematics governing next month's 
special 76th Assembly District election, attracting the votes of as few as one 
in 10 registered voters could insure a landslide victory in the race to select 
a successor to the late Bill Bradley (R-Escondido). 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more surprising than that unusually low electoral threshold is the 
fact that most of the nine candidates in the Aug. 8 campaign doubt that anyone 
will surpass it in the sprawling district, which stretches from northeastern 
San Diego County to the South Bay, and also includes parts of Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one time when there may be more candidates than voters," joked 
Democrat Stephen Thorne. 
</P>
<P>
The public's tepid attitude toward the contest obscures the fact that Bradley's 
death last month after a nearly four-year battle with cancer created a rare 
opportunity for a wide open Assembly race in San Diego County, where most 
legislative districts' lopsided partisan voter registration and incumbents' 
longevity historically discourage serious competition. 
</P>
<P>
Registration within the 76th District itself is heavily slanted toward 
Republicans, 54% to 33% -- a daunting disparity that could leave the 
all-but-certain GOP victor with a seat viewed so safe as to be a lifetime job. 
</P>
<P>
Although that tantalizing prospect has piqued uncommonly strong interest among 
Bradley's would-be successors, as evidenced by the size of the field, there is 
little indication that the public shares that sentiment. Special elections 
typically draw low turnouts, a trend likely to be exacerbated in this race by a 
mid-summer primary in a district that encompasses desert communities where 
daily temperatures often are higher than the number of voters in many 
precincts. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as the two-month campaign enters its final three weeks, the consensus 
of the candidates and their consultants is that next month's turnout probably 
will be only about 20%, with some forecasting a turnout percentage as low as 
the mid-teens. 
</P>
<P>
To win election outright in the primary, a candidate must receive more than 50% 
of the vote -- a figure that, based on the 20% projection, equates to only 
about 10% of the district's approximately 240,000 voters. 
</P>
<P>
If no candidate achieves that 50%-plus margin in the primary -- in which all 
contenders of all parties will appear on a single ballot -- the top Republican 
and Democratic vote-getters would compete in an Oct. 3 runoff. (Ten candidates 
have qualified for the primary, but one -- Republican Lori Holt Pfeiler -- 
withdrew last week and endorsed fellow Republican Tricia Hunter. Pfeiler's 
name, however, remains on the ballot.) 
</P>
<P>
The campaign's unusual format, combined with its brevity and large field, has 
complicated the candidates' efforts to devise an effective strategy for 
reaching voters from Bonita to Palomar and Jacumba to Palm Desert in a shorter 
time than candidates usually take to decide whether to run. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the time span, the circumstances, the number of candidates and 
everything else, this is a once-in-a-lifetime campaign," said Republican Poway 
City Councilwoman Linda Brannon, one of seven GOP candidates in the race. "Just 
about everything about it is unique." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a blink-your-eye-and-it's-over kind of campaign," added Glenn 
Richardson, another GOP candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its short duration, the campaign likely will end up being more 
expensive than most full-length Assembly contests -- again, largely because of 
the rarity of an "open" seat race. With three major candidates planning to 
spend at least $150,000 each, the price tag for the primary alone is expected 
to approach $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the numerical possibilities of an exceptionally low turnout being 
splintered among nine people, the candidates and their strategists acknowledge 
that even seemingly minor first-time candidates could play a pivotal role in 
next month's primary. By siphoning off critical votes from the front runners, 
the long shots could scramble the vote breakdowns, conceivably allowing one of 
the lesser-known candidates to slip into the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
That potential is of gravest concern to the three candidates who appear to be 
running the most well-rounded, well-funded campaigns: Brannon, Poway 
businessman Dick Lyles and Bonita nurse Tricia Hunter. Each has assembled a 
sizable grass roots organization, is well on the way to a six-figure campaign 
budget, appears polished in front of campaign audiences and can point to 
significant backing and endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
A second tier of strong challengers, each of whom hopes to spend about 
$100,000, includes San Diego Police Lt. Bill Hoover of Escondido, state Senate 
legislative aide Dennis Koolhaas of Escondido and Richardson, a former 
television commentator from Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
The district's demographics alone appear to diminish the chances of the two 
Democrats in the race -- Jeannine Correia, an instructor of the retarded from 
Poway, and mental health worker Stephen Thorne of Escondido. Meanwhile, retired 
appliance-store owner Ray Foster of Spring Valley summed up the long odds that 
he confronts in his low-budget campaign this way: "I'm out to answer the 
question: 'Can a guy make his initial political run after age 65 and be 
successful?' " 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the answer appears to be: Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
However, as Correia points out, because of the peculiar nature of the 76th 
District contest, "no one can be automatically counted out." As a result, most 
of the candidates are able to offer winning scenarios that, while still 
implausible, cannot be dismissed quite as lightly as they normally would be. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' admittedly slim chances, for example, hinge on hopes that a 
solid Democratic turnout could swamp a light, splintered GOP vote. Other 
candidates talk of attracting specific blocs of voters while their opponents 
neutralize each other. Republicans and Democrats alike are placing a strong 
emphasis on absentee ballots, viewing that as a surer source of votes than 
Election Day polling places. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, as the only Riverside County candidate in the race, Richardson is 
particularly intrigued by the race's potential arithmetic possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego has (about 70%) of the vote and eight candidates, and Riverside has 
(30%) and one candidate," Richardson noted. "Interesting math. Very interesting 
math."

HELPER OF HOMELESS MAY FACE EVICTION; 
</P>
<P>
COSTA MESA COUNCIL TO DEBATE FATE OF SOS, WHICH SOME NEIGHBORS SAY DOES NOT 
BELONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jean Forbath glanced knowingly at the note that the Latina had brought. It was 
a plea for assistance written by an emergency-room nurse who had treated the 
70-year-old woman for a chronic heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
Forbath, founder and director of SOS (Share Our Selves), pointed to a drawer 
full of index cards that recorded the woman's dozens of visits to the SOS 
center over the years. "This is how many times we have helped her, because no 
one else will," Forbath said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1971, SOS has been serving those caught at society's bottom rung by 
offering food, clothes, free medical care and other aid. Last year, it spent 
about $600,000, most of it from private donations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Desirability of Clientele 
</P>
<P>
But that effort may soon end, a victim of community conflict over the 
desirability of SOS's clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight the Costa Mesa City Council is scheduled to debate whether to evict SOS 
from its longtime home at the Rea Community Center in the city's west side. 
Hundreds of residents, both supporters and opponents of SOS, are expected to 
jam the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is about our rights for a quiet, peaceful neighborhood. That's all we 
want," said Barbara Littrell, who lives opposite the center and has urged that 
SOS be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not against what SOS is doing," she said. "They just don't belong in 
our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Forbath sees irony in the reaction of such neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Services, Greater Backlash' 
</P>
<P>
"The more services (for the needy) the community has developed, the greater the 
backlash," she said. "It is a counterswell of reaction to any threat to our 
(status) as a middle-class bastion that Orange County has seen itself as for so 
long. We have been in Costa Mesa for 19 years, and only now are we having these 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
If SOS is forced to leave Rea center, it will probably mean the end of its 
programs, Forbath said: "We could not afford the rent or meet other 
restrictions we would encounter if we tried to move to another location." 
</P>
<P>
Studies of the people SOS serves show that the center is in the right location, 
she said. According to SOS surveys, the group serves 6,000 to 7,500 people a 
month, about 5,000 of whom are Costa Mesa residents. Two-thirds of those live 
within walking distance of the Rea center. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Littrell, who was on a city-government task force to study the impact 
of SOS on the neighborhood, said she has statistics showing that only about 25% 
of SOS's clients are from Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides have been signing up supporters on petitions to present to the City 
Council. Forbath said SOS has collected the signatures of more than 3,000 Costa 
Mesa residents who support SOS, most from west side neighborhoods. Littrell 
said SOS foes have "thousands" of signatures. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of other organizations in Costa Mesa that have food programs 
and other assistance," Littrell said. "I don't see that these people are going 
to fall on their faces if this one is closed." 
</P>
<P>
Early one recent morning, Forbath surveyed the crowd that had already gathered 
at the center. There were young, white teen-agers, a black man with a toddler, 
Latina mothers with their children, single men and women, couples with no 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Most have problems that fall between the cracks in government aid programs, 
such as the dilemma faced by the 70-year-old Latina. The bill for her emergency 
visit to the hospital for a heart condition was paid with government health 
funds, but she had to go to SOS for money to fill her prescription. 
</P>
<P>
By 9 a.m., stub No. 52 had already been picked up. The temperature would reach 
more than 100 degrees and the clock would reach 1 p.m. before No. 52 was 
called. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 30, treinta, No. 30, treinta," Forbath called through a public address 
microphone. The volume was turned high because of the constant noise, like a 
bus station full of adults talking, children playing or crying and people 
shuffling in and out the door. 
</P>
<P>
To Forbath, who founded SOS 19 years ago, it seemed a fairly quiet, easy day. 
</P>
<P>
No. 30 was a Latina mother with two little girls. The woman struggled with her 
English, and Forbath struggled with her Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told about how hard it had been to find work since the new 
immigration laws took effect. She was broke and wanted to return home to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Forms, No Questions 
</P>
<P>
There were no forms to fill out or questions to test her story. Forbath said 
the premise of SOS is that it would be worse to withhold money from someone in 
need than to give money to someone dishonest. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is going to get rich off of this, no matter what," she said. "Anybody 
who would wait this long to get this little has to need some help." 
</P>
<P>
Forbath looked up the bus fare to Tijuana and wrote a check to the bus company. 
Then she wrote another check for $50, money the woman could spend as she 
pleased. Before the family left, Forbath gave the girls toys: a green, plastic 
jump rope and two plastic kazoos. 
</P>
<P>
No. 35 was a thin white man about 50 years old with a stubble beard, blue 
jeans, boots and a big silver belt buckle reading "The State of Texas." He said 
he had done "spot labor" lately and used to drive trucks. He had a wife and a 
16-year-old daughter. His rent was due, but he would not have any money for two 
more days. 
</P>
<P>
Forbath asked whether he had ever applied for welfare. "I've never been on 
welfare, and I don't like it," he replied, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Forbath showed him a list of unskilled jobs available and wrote him a $42 check 
for two nights in a nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
There are other social service groups based at the Rea center. Within the 
former junior high school, surrounded by a neatly clipped lawn, a 
boys-and-girls club holds its meetings, a day-care center serves senior 
citizens and another agency serves disabled patients. 
</P>
<P>
There once was a soup kitchen as well, but it was ordered closed by the City 
Council several months ago after neighbors complained about the people it 
attracted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Be Bad Apples' 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of SOS, including soup kitchen operator Merle Hatleberg, had hoped 
closing the charity would relieve some of the congestion around the center and 
appease unhappy neighbors, leaving SOS free to operate. The City Council agreed 
to wait and see; a report on the outcome will be presented at tonight's council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Littrell said: "We didn't see any major improvement. When you bring that many 
people into a neighborhood, there are going to be bad apples who heckle 
children, cause trouble. . . . We still feel threatened. . . . There are still 
people sleeping in the park." 
</P>
<P>
But Costa Mesa City Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle said police reports do not 
corroborate allegations that crime has increased around the Rea center or that 
patrons of the center disturb residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I live close enough to the center that I drive by every day, and I see little 
impact on the neighborhood," Hornbuckle said. "I'm still waiting for hard 
evidence that shows those concerns are real. I'm just hoping reality prevails 
and that Costa Mesa's historical, traditional compassion comes through." 
</P>
<P>
"There are no easy answers," Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis said. "I have to 
honestly say that I wouldn't want to live by the center, so I don't know if 
it's right, as a councilwoman, to say someone else should. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time, where do you send all those poor people? It's difficult, 
because normally even if you're in the minority on an issue, if you know you're 
in the right you can feel good. But in this case there are so many grays."

SCORNED BOYFRIEND KILLS EX-GIRLFRIEND, HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The breakup of a romance led to murder and suicide early Sunday outside a Santa 
Ana home, where a scorned boyfriend shot his 23-year-old former girlfriend in 
the head, then killed himself, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Vo Hiep Ngoc, 28, died instantly after shooting himself on the front lawn of 
his home in the 4000 block of West Morningside Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
His estranged girlfriend, Thi Cam Nguyen, 23, of Garden Grove, died two hours 
after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses in the neighborhood reported the gunfire about 4 a.m., said Santa Ana 
Police Sgt. Randy Eldridge, who provided the following account: 
</P>
<P>
In the front yard of Ngoc's home, the couple got into a loud argument about 
their breakup. The two began to struggle and soon were in the street near the 
intersection of West Street and Morningside -- a neighborhood south of 17th 
Street, between Newhope Street and Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Ngoc allegedly knocked Nguyen to the ground, then shot her once in the head 
with a .38-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
He then picked her up and half-dragged her into the front yard of his home, 
where he shot her at least one more time in the head. Witnesses said Ngoc then 
put the gun to his own temple and pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrived and found both bodies on the front lawn. Ngoc was declared dead 
at the scene. Nguyen was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where she was 
pronounced dead about 6 a.m., Eldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Larry Wagstaff said he did not know what provoked the breakup of 
the relationship or how long the couple had been together. 
</P>
<P>
Luz Ramirez, who lives across the street from Ngoc's house, said she and her 
family heard what they thought were fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, we heard the police cars and we went outside," Ramirez said. 
"But we only heard the shots. We didn't see anything."

COMMISSION TO CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR DEALING WITH DUMP PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, trucks loaded with two million tons of garbage chugged their way 
along winding canyon roads to one of two landfills in north Orange County, and 
the giant dumps are now nearly full. The Santiago Canyon landfill east of 
Orange will reach its capacity next year, and the Olinda Canyon dump in Brea 
will by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The county Planning Commission will hold a public hearing on Tuesday to 
consider 10 options for dealing with the landfill crisis for the area bounded 
by Beach Boulevard, the Garden Grove Freeway and the eastern county line. Among 
the proposals are expanding the Olinda landfill and building a new dump in one 
of the large vacant canyons on the eastern fringes of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is at a crossroads in its long-term planning for the future 
needs of its citizens," according to a landfill study commissioned by the Board 
of Supervisors in 1985 and completed by planning consultants with Michael 
Brandman Associates. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the past, where after a landfill had filled up it was a simple matter 
to locate another undeveloped area and build another landfill, these 10 sites 
proposed for the next generation landfill may be the last 10 large viable 
disposal sites remaining in north Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The study recommends that the Olinda landfill be expanded to allow for another 
27 years' use and also that the county buy land in at least one vacant canyon 
to be used for several hundred years' worth of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last week, however, the county Waste Management Commission 
recommended that further environmental studies be authorized for three sites: 
Olinda Canyon, West Fremont Canyon and Gypsum Canyon. Although Gypsum has 
already been named as the likely spot for a new county jail, environmental 
planners say the canyon is big enough for both a jail and a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to expand the Olinda landfill is likely to draw fire from Brea 
residents, who are not eager to see more trash brought into their area. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Hicks, a former Brea city councilwoman and a member of the Waste 
Management Commission, protested the recommendation to expand Olinda, 
contending that creating a 690-acre landfill there would involve destroying the 
ridge between the Olinda and Olinda-Alpha canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's the same as saying, 'Since the McColl dump (in Fullerton) has 
hazardous wastes in it, then let's make it the hazardous waste site,' " she 
said.

Brea City Manager Frank Benest said that although the Olinda landfill expansion 
is a major issue in the community, the City Council has not yet taken a 
position on it. 
</P>
<P>
"We all see the trucks going through town," he said. "We all can look up and 
see the side of the mountain is open to the landfill." Benest said the county 
should be prepared to work with Brea to ease the traffic, noise and air 
pollution problems that would result from an expansion. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the Olinda landfill is likely to end up with 80% of the amount of 
garbage now being hauled to Santiago Canyon when that landfill closes next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The county would have to spend about $36 million to acquire the land to expand 
the Olinda landfill. That, according to the study, would be the cheapest of the 
landfill alternatives. The other advantages for that alternative, according to 
the study, are that hauling routes are already established and county agencies 
are already familiar with the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The drawbacks are that the expansion would only take care of north Orange 
County for another 27 years and would delay by 30 years a plan to convert the 
landfill into a regional park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environmental Concerns 
</P>
<P>
In terms of land use, according to the report, the 1,930-acre West Fremont 
Canyon would be a compatible choice that could contain north Orange County's 
trash for 185 years. However, it would cost the county about $118 million to 
acquire the land and build the dump, and there are environmental concerns 
associated with destroying vegetation and wildlife in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Gypsum Canyon has even more drawbacks, the report says. Acquiring the land and 
building a dump there would cost $200 million, and putting a dump next to a 
jail could pose health problems for inmates and employees. Another 
environmental concern is that geological studies show that there are artesian 
wells in the lower reaches of the canyon that are linked to ground water that 
could become polluted by landfill trash. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, part of the proposed eastern transportation corridor runs through 
the canyon, therefore limiting the size and choice of location for a landfill. 
If the entire canyon was made available for a dump, however, it would take 
nearly 600 years to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants' report also considers alternatives such as recycling, 
composting, trash-to-energy conversion plants and taking wastes to a remote 
site outside the county. 
</P>
<P>
While such alternatives hold promise, the study says, "these technologies are 
not a panacea for the present and foreseeable landfill capacity problem 
confronting north Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission meeting will begin at 2 p.m. in the Planning Commission 
Hearing Room in the Administration Building of the county office complex in 
Santa Ana. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider the landfill issue 
in a meeting on Aug. 16.

<P>
Police continued their search for suspects Sunday after a Santa Ana man was 
killed and two of his friends were wounded early Saturday in what investigators 
classified as a gang-related shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bob Clark said the shooting took place at 1:30 a.m. in a convenience 
store's parking lot at the corner of Warner Avenue and Pacific Street. Three 
young men in a car pulled up next to another car and opened fire with a 
semiautomatic assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Anthony Brooks, 19, was shot once in the head and died instantly, police 
said. Michael Serrano, who was at the wheel of the car, was shot in the chest. 
A second passenger, Johnny Guerrero, 20, was shot once in the right buttock. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano was in stable condition and Guerrero in good condition at Coastal 
Communities Hospital. Both are from Santa Ana.

TO TRAVELERS, AMERICA LOOKS BEAUTIFUL FROM SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NOME, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing in books or movies had prepared me for the reality of traveling in the 
far reaches of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Having just completed a three-week tour of that country with Tony Aliengena, 
the 11-year-old San Juan Capistrano boy attempting to pilot an airplane around 
the world, I returned to the United States with memories of a culture that few 
Americans will ever know and a fresh appreciation for things we take for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
Like toilet paper, which is in short supply in many Soviet restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
In abundance, however, were beautiful forests of white birch and pine, 
stretching from Moscow all the way to the Pacific Ocean, at least along the 
Siberian route we flew. The rivers and streams were wide and clear and 
seemingly unpolluted. 
</P>
<P>
In the cities, we were intrigued by the public saunas where you can receive a 
relaxing peppermint-leaf massage, then plunge into warm pools replenished by 
waterfalls that churn the surface like a giant Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the food. 
</P>
<P>
I found Soviet beverages to be an adventure in taste. Most drinks I tried had 
so much sugar they were difficult to finish. Although Pepsi is sold in Moscow 
and Leningrad, it is not available elsewhere in the country, so I found myself 
mostly drinking the local water, which in many Siberian cities was cold and 
clear from the tap. 
</P>
<P>
The alcohol, on the other hand, was quite good. Russian vodka and cognac, 
poured after some meals, helped us forget how far we were from home. 
</P>
<P>
Our hosts served exquisite caviar and champagne in each city we entered. And I 
was delighted by the rich chocolate candy and vanilla ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
But I wasn't the only one in our party to balk when presented with an evening 
meal of reindeer tongue served in gelatin. 
</P>
<P>
At a dinner in the Soviet port city of Anadyr, all of the dishes of reindeer 
tongue sat virtually untouched with our Soviet hosts looking on in 
consternation. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know that reindeer tongue is a great delicacy here?" our interpreter 
leaned over and whispered. I took one bite for the sake of diplomacy and 
quickly decided that it must be an acquired taste. 
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, as might be expected, cleanliness was sometimes a problem. 
</P>
<P>
One morning at breakfast in Magadan, few of us touched our plates of cold link 
sausage because they 
</P>
<P>
'Do you know that reindeer tongue is a great delicacy here?' our interpreter 
leaned over and whispered. 
</P>
<P>
were served from a pan where flies had been swarming. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally we were surprised to receive a more American fare. In the fishing 
village of Okhotsk, for example, our hosts presented a delicious dinner of 
fresh salmon steak and mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, by the end or the trip we were all so homesick for American food that we 
were fantasizing aloud about our favorite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
"I want deep-dish pizza, a big slice right now!" said Susan Eisner, a member of 
a Los Angeles film crew accompanying Tony. 
</P>
<P>
"And I want a big double cheeseburger with chili and fries," added Shawn 
Hardin, a fellow film crew member. 
</P>
<P>
Communication was never easy. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to place a telephone call outside the country seemed an 
impossibility in many cities. In attempting to report on Tony's travels, for 
example, I was able to get through to the United States only about half the 
times I tried. 
</P>
<P>
And when I did get through, the connection was usually so bad that I had to 
shout to be heard. In Anadyr last week I shouted my way through more than half 
a story when the line suddenly went dead. Since it takes as long as eight hours 
to get a Soviet operator to place an international call, I slammed down the 
phone in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Aleksie Grinevich, a Moscow journalist who traveled with us, had warned me 
about telephone difficulties. Even he was unable to call Moscow from some of 
the more remote outposts, such as Okhotsk. 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming the language, naturally, was a bigger problem. I often had to use 
hand gestures to convey the simplest information. In Moscow one night I 
resorted to sketching a picture of some puppets to let a cabdriver know I 
needed to go to the Moscow puppet theater near the Times' Moscow bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The language difficulty would have been insurmountable had Grinevich not helped 
coordinate everything from hotel reservations to dinner and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
There were other rigors of travel. Laundry rooms were in such short supply that 
we had to wash clothes with coarse bath soap and then hang them out to dry. 
</P>
<P>
And throughout the country, mosquitoes were a pest in our hotel rooms, which 
rarely had window screens. 
</P>
<P>
The warmth and friendliness of the Soviet people made up for most of our travel 
woes. Large crowds greeted us at every stop. 
</P>
<P>
But we were all so ecstatic at returning to the United States that on the last 
day of our stay in the Soviet Union we could barely contain ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Our impatience was fueled by a visiting Alaskan we met in Anadyr who gave us 
directions to the best cheeseburger joint in Nome.

POSTSCRIPT: PIER GROUPS STRUGGLE TO REBUILD SURF CITY LANDMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The End Cafe has been gone for some time, ripped off the Huntington Beach Pier 
by a storm 18 months ago. And while the 76-year-old, landmark pier -- 
California's longest -- still reaches into the surf, it has been closed to the 
public since July 12, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But a grass-roots fund-raising drive and aggressive city lobbying for money 
have resulted in the hope that the pier will be rebuilt by late summer, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the money has proved difficult, however. The city hopes to raise up to 
$9 million from federal, state and county government agencies, plus another $1 
million in "major donations" from businesses and developers who stand to 
benefit from a rebuilt pier. 
</P>
<P>
About $2.5 million of the total has already been raised. Of that sum, 
Huntington Beach has committed $1.6 million, most of it to be spent on design 
and consulting work before construction, which is scheduled to begin by April, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
While Huntington Beach leaders have been rallying financial support, the number 
of beach-goers in the pier area has dropped by up to 40%, city officials said. 
Merchants who benefit from beach traffic say that closing the landmark has been 
the hardest blow to business, which has also been affected by redevelopment 
construction across Pacific Coast Highway from the pier. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, the pier that people recall when they think of Surf City 
suffered severe wave damage. Six months later, Fluor Daniel Corp. of Irvine, 
hired to size up repairs for the concrete landmark, instead concluded that it 
is structurally unsound. 
</P>
<P>
Without notice, Huntington Beach officials closed the pier at 3 p.m. the same 
day, denying many fishermen and beach-goers a final stroll. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was Ella Christensen, 76, who for 37 years sold bait, beer and 
sandwiches from her three shops on the pier. Whether Christensen will return to 
her former home away from home is unknown, but she is not holding her breath 
and is keeping busy sewing, reading and managing real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just getting used to being a has-been," she said last week, fingering a 
pearl strand during breakfast. "It took six months to see as how I got the 
shaft. That finally sunk in. It's taken the last six months trying to get over 
it. Not sure that I am yet, either." 
</P>
<P>
City Adminstrator Paul Cook said advance notice might have triggered an unsafe 
stampede onto the pier for a final beer and hot dog at Neptune's Locker, 
Christensen's briny pub overlooking the waves. 
</P>
<P>
In the days that followed, Christensen's customers berated the Huntington Beach 
City Council for leaving her in the lurch after decades of good service. They 
suggested that the city bolster crossbeams at the inland end of the pier so the 
300 feet up to the water line could reopen. While Christensen's Tackle Box near 
the end of the 1,830-foot pier would still have been shut, her Captain's Galley 
sandwich shop and Neptune's could have reopened. 
</P>
<P>
However, city leaders balked at the expense. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council appointed design and fund-raising panels, which are making 
progress. Reconstruction plans have been approved by the council. The landmark 
is expected to be rebuilt of concrete at about the same length, with public 
restrooms, sandwich and bait shops, and a restaurant at the end. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder promised $250,000 from county harbors, 
beaches and parks funds; the city hopes to get $750,000 more from the same 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most encouraging, said Richard Barnard, assistant to Cook and a 
fund-raising panel member, a groundswell of community work has reaped about 
$100,000. Grant deeds sold for $25 each netted each buyer his or her name on a 
one-foot-square parcel of the future pier. A seniors dance raised $14,000. 
Students selling bookmarks, buttons and iron-on patches raised another $6,000. 
Beach parking fees have been raised by $1 per car to raise about $100,000 
during two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The support in the community has really been impressive," Barnard added. "It 
just shows a lot of interest at the grass-roots level for the pier." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Schenkman, a marketing consultant who is chairman of the fund-raising panel 
and a former Huntington Beach mayor, said the group has identified several 
government agencies that may kick in money. Two bills designed to pay for 
repairing state piers may also help the city. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been no promises. Gov. George Deukmejian last week deleted $1.5 
million from the state budget that Huntington Beach officials hoped would help 
pay for the pier, but Schenkman said that does not preclude asking for it next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
If the pier is rebuilt by next summer -- and some say that is dubious -- it is 
still uncertain whether Christensen would win the bidding to run any of the 
businesses on it. 
</P>
<P>
She is free to try but seems almost weary at the thought. She owns a Santa Ana 
condominium, a home in Joshua Tree and other land. 
</P>
<P>
"Real estate isn't my fancy either," she said. "I'm not well heeled, but I've 
got sufficient to get by on." 
</P>
<P>
The uprooting a year ago has left her bitter. But the woman whom devoted 
lifeguards and police officers called the Queen of the Pier is still drawn to 
the fishermen and the shore. 
</P>
<P>
Not lately, though. "Nah," she said, standing at the base of the pier. "Nothing 
down here for me anymore. I'm thinking maybe I'll go to college."

MUSYOKI COMES UP SHORT OF WORLD RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
BUT KENYAN IS FAST ENOUGH TO WIN BASTILLE DAY 8K IN NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Standing at the start of the Bastille Day 8K in Newport Beach Sunday morning, 
William Musyoki glanced up at the overcast skies, bent down to touch his toes, 
and readied himself for his lastest assault on a world record. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-feet-3 and 110-pounds, Musyoki, a 22-year-old native of Kenya, is a 
diminutive man with decided goals. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, like the Sunday before, Musyoki's aim was to run a world best, this 
time to better Alberto Salazar's eight-kilometer record of 22 minutes 7 
seconds, which has stood for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
He did not come close, missing the record by nearly 50 seconds. Although 
Musyoki won -- gaining $1,000 and an all-expense-paid trip for two to Paris -- 
his time of 22:56 was also not fast enough to break the 22:46 course record set 
by Tracey Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not tired, but when you run alone in front, you need some help," said 
Musyoki, a resident of Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
The help he received was merely temporary. At the gun, Musyoki quickly took the 
lead, with several runners funneling in behind his smooth, fluid stride. But 
after the first 200 yards, only one man, Francisco Pacheco of Mexico City, was 
in contact. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start, I didn't know Musyoki was here," said Pacheco, speaking through 
an interpreter. "But when I saw him in line, I figured, 'No big deal.' I've run 
with better guys." 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco, 27, and a member of the Mexican national team, took the lead for a few 
strides, then, letting Musyoki take over, dropped a stride behind and let the 
Kenyan set the pace. Together, 50 yards ahead of the pack, they passed the 
first mile in 4:24 -- the pace for a 22:00 8K. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco, trying to keep as close to Musyoki as possible to have better 
protection from the light winds, almost clipped the leader's heels at one 
point. Musyoki countered with a few quick zigzags and a surge, leaving Pacheco 
10 yards behind. 
</P>
<P>
Musyoki quickly extended his lead, though his time at two miles (8:57, eight 
seconds ahead of Pacheco) was about five seconds slower than world-record pace. 
From there, Musyoki tried to maintain, but after passing the four-mile mark in 
18:25 -- about 25 seconds slower than he had hoped -- he knew he would be far 
short of a world record. 
</P>
<P>
"The fourth mile (time), when I saw it I just said, 'Oh, I wouldn't get the 
record,' I said just go for the win." 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco made a chase of it, however. After trailing by nearly 13 seconds, he 
closed in to within striking distance. But in the last mile, Musyoki, who never 
looked back, slightly picked up his pace and sprinted to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco earned $800 for second (23:07), and Tim Gruber of San Jose received 
$400 for third (23:28). 
</P>
<P>
Musyoki, who has run a race each of the last five weekends, said he is 
considering cutting back his race schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I race (a lot) because everybody wants me to race; I don't want to disappoint 
them," he said. "But nowadays, I know I've been racing too much. My body tells 
me this. I think I need to test a new (training) formula. The one I'm using now 
is not working very good." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he still felt he could break a world record, he said, "Why not? If 
anyone else can break it, why not me?" 
</P>
<P>
In the women's division, 34-year-old Michele Hopper Buchicchio of Glendora 
outlasted Leslie Lewis, also 34, in winning in 26:50. She also earned $1,000 
and a trip for two to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
In winning her first race since having a baby 17 months ago, Buchicchio cruised 
the first mile in 5:08 with Lewis and UC Irvine All-American Beth McGrann at 
her side. As McGrann dropped back, Lewis and Buchicchio ran together until the 
3 1/2-mile point, where Buchicchio surged, leaving Lewis behind. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis (27:10) finished second for $800, though McGrann almost caught her but 
had to settle for third (27:11) and $400. 
</P>
<P>
Race Notes: 
</P>
<P>
More than $12,000 was raised Saturday night in hopes of giving William Musyoki 
-- or any other capable runner -- more incentive to break the world record. Had 
a world record been set, the record setter would have split the $12,000 with a 
designated charity. Said Musyoki: "Yes, when I heard that, I said, 'Ooooooh." 
Honorary race chairman and former pole vaulter Bob Seagren announced that the 
goal for next year is to raise $100,000 for a world-record bonus/charity 
donation to attract more world-class runners. . . . A total of 4,120 registered 
runners, including about 165 U.S. Marines running in formation, finished the 
8K. . . . Ray Stewart of Downey won the wheelchair division in 18:50, and John 
Morgan, a blind runner who races with a guide, finished in 32:51.

AT 72, ARCO FOUNDER ROBERT ANDERSON IS BUILDING A SECOND EMPIRE AT PAULEY

The first time Robert O. Anderson started an oil company, things were simpler. 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, all he needed was $150,000 in capital, a couple of partners and $1,400 
in drilling rig equipment. He packed up his belongings and his new wife and 
daughter and drove half a continent from his native Chicago to settle in the 
arid desert of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
It worked out pretty well. After 25 years as an independent oilman and 
wildcatter, Anderson helped create and run Atlantic Richfield Co., which grew 
into the seventh-largest oil company in the country before Anderson left in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
On the way, Anderson's annual income as Arco's chairman exceeded $1 million a 
year. He became a land baron, patron of the arts, adviser to presidents and an 
unmistakable industry presence in his trademark bow tie and well-worn Stetson. 
</P>
<P>
Now 72, Anderson could have retired to the solitude of his beloved New Mexico 
ranch, where he still tools around in the 1949 Oldsmobile convertible that was 
a perk in a long-ago deal. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he is trying again to build an oil company the way he did in the 
beginning -- from the ground up. "I happen to think that a rocking chair and a 
television screen are a quick way to the graveyard," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, Anderson assumed control of tiny Pauley Petroleum Inc. by 
merging his private Hondo Oil &amp; Gas Co. with Pauley in a deal valued at the 
time at about $42 million. Pauley was founded by the late Edwin W. Pauley, 
himself a Los Angeles millionaire oil entrepreneur and presidential adviser 
perhaps best known as the namesake of UCLA's basketball pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, eager to recapture the hands-on feel of the oil business he had lost 
as chairman of Arco, aims to transform Pauley from a moribund refiner and 
producer into a fully integrated oil company. "In a sense, I guess it is 
starting all over again -- or picking up where I left off, depending on how you 
look at it," he said last week in Pauley's small Westwood office. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a year and a half since the merger, and he may be finding that it's 
not as easy as it was the first time around. "Everything's running, but not 
quite the way we want it yet. . . . For some reason, things just don't move as 
fast; things are bigger, more complicated I guess," he said. "But patience is 
the key to it all." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has already transformed Pauley into a company resembling his earliest 
oil ventures. Like them, Pauley has oil and gas holdings largely in the 
Rockies, New Mexico and Texas, and is focusing primarily on exploring and 
drilling for oil. 
</P>
<P>
Because of exploration costs, debt-servicing costs, and depressed crude and 
refined product prices, the company reported a loss of $9.5 million in the 
first six months of fiscal 1989 on revenue of $151 million. That compares to 
net income of $4.6 million on revenue of $65.8 million in the year earlier 
period. 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson and other industry insiders feel that Pauley's fortunes should 
turn around now that oil prices are easing back up and with expectations that 
natural gas demand should grow. "Next year will be the first year we'll have 
the opportunity to put the whole thing together," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Anderson is leading a move quietly to divest Pauley, 
headquartered for many years in the Los Angeles area, of all its local 
holdings, including its Newhall refinery, said William R. Pagen, Pauley's 
former chairman and now part-time vice chairman. The company's headquarters 
have already moved to Roswell, New Mexico, the base of all Anderson's 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his Westwood office, Anderson seems every bit the oil executive in 
his tailored blue suit. His hair has gone white, and his speech is more 
measured than it once was, although he still discourses easily on subjects from 
global warming to natural gas supplies to corporate dividend policies. 
</P>
<P>
But then he smiles as he picks up his battered hat, fingers a fishing fly in 
the band and abruptly interrupts a conversation: "That's a Rat-faced 
McDougall," he says with a laugh. "With a hair body." 
</P>
<P>
Why would a man so enamored of fly fishing want to get back into oil 
prospecting? "You don't get involved in this business in the first place unless 
there's something burning in you to go out and drill holes in the ground and 
risk everything in a venture," said H. R. (Bud) Scoggins, president of the 
Independent Petroleum Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
That urge is what drove Anderson, the son of a Chicago banker, to spend summers 
away from the University of Chicago on oil pipeline crews in Texas, shoulder to 
shoulder with the roughnecks in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refining Company Partner 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, he bought into a partnership in a small refining company in Artesia, 
New Mexico. During the war, Anderson sold jet fuel to the nearby Army Air Corps 
station and delivered diesel fuel to a mysterious government camp in nearby Los 
Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife were in their mountain cabin about 50 miles away when the early 
morning atomic blast from the camp lit up the room like daylight, he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Anderson completed a series of deals that increased his 
holdings of both oil and gas properties, refineries and retail outlets. He 
moved his base of operations to Roswell, New Mexico, and began acquiring land 
and livestock for his ranching interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in the country because I'm very sensitive to the environment," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1950s, Anderson's Hondo Oil &amp; Gas Co. struck oil in the 
Empire-Abo oil field, one of the largest in the Southwest, with 250 million 
barrels in reserve. His holdings in the field caught the attention of 
crude-starved Atlantic Refining Co. of Philadelphia. In 1962, Hondo merged with 
Atlantic, giving Anderson stock worth $32 million, making him the company's 
largest shareholder and putting him on the track to the chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appalling Discovery 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, the independent oilman, was appalled to discover that many of the 
Philadelphia executives were unfamiliar with routine oil field jargon. 
Throughout his career, he worked to erase the gap between the executive suites 
and the drilling rigs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, shortly after his election as chairman, Anderson and President 
Thornton Bradshaw used a transatlantic plane trip to formulate a six-point 
strategy that was to eventually see the company through its greatest period of 
growth. That strategy included focusing on key areas of the business and 
keeping them in balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Most companies don't take an objective view of what they do," he said. "But I 
think a company should philosophically review its activities and what it's 
doing every few years. If you don't, certain segments of a company will grow 
faster than the rest." 
</P>
<P>
A fishing trip with Charlie Jones, chairman of the Richfield Oil Corp. cemented 
the merger that would create Arco and bring the company its greatest asset: 
leases on the North Slope of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson made his first trip to the North Slope in 1966, wearing a suit and 
carrying his boots and jeans in a duffel bag, he recalled. At the time, many 
oil companies had abandoned unsuccessful efforts to find oil there -- and Arco, 
under Anderson's direction, was among the last to drill exploratory wells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepared to be Wrong 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that if we hadn't made a discovery, it would have been the 
last well drilled on the North Slope for a good many years," he recalled of the 
decision to proceed after a series of failures. "But you shouldn't be an 
explorer for oil and gas unless you're prepared to be wrong 80% or 90% of the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Arco under Anderson's chairmanship would be one of the players in 
the costly and frustrating construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. 
Anderson recalls the high emotions surrounding the proposed pipeline: during 
one speech in Washington, a young woman walked up and doused him with a can of 
motor oil. 
</P>
<P>
During this time, Anderson became one of the largest landowners in the world. 
He still owns major ranches in New Mexico and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
He advised and befriended presidents, became an active figure in Republican 
politics and was considered for numerous civic appointments. 
</P>
<P>
The namesake of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's newest wing, he also 
became known for his devotion to the arts and world affairs, a passion he 
imprinted on Arco as well. He chaired dozens of cultural groups, helped revive 
the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, underwrote research into global 
problems and engineered bailouts of respected but financially troubled 
publications like the London Observer and Harper's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grabbing the Public Eye 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, Bradshaw seemed to grab more of the public's attention. But even 
that was part of Anderson's design. At his busiest, Anderson devoted only a 
couple of days a week to Arco and traveled as much as 500 miles a day. A given 
week might take him from an Arco board meeting in Los Angeles to a seminar at 
the Aspen Institute in Colorado to his ranch in Roswell to spend time with his 
wife, Barbara, his two sons and five daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, he estimates, he devotes a third of his time to interests outside 
Pauley and still travels several thousand miles a year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, as crude oil prices were poised to plunge and oil company takeovers 
were in the wind, Anderson was part of the management team that engineered a 
major restructuring of Arco that included a major stock repurchase, staff 
reductions, divestment of Eastern retailing and refining operations and 
curtailment of exploration. Later that year, Anderson resigned his 
chairmanship, and in 1986, left the company completely. 
</P>
<P>
"He left a company that was very well poised to take advantage of a very tricky 
environment," said oil consultant Thomas Wachtell. 
</P>
<P>
Current Arco executives declined to discuss Anderson's new venture, but Arco 
Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook said in a statement: "Bob left us a firm foundation 
on which to build, and we are grateful for his leadership during those pivotal 
years." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Arco in 1986, Anderson and the British conglomerate Lonrho PLC 
bought some of Arco's marginal oil and gas properties for an estimated $180 
million in a bidding process that drew some criticism and a shareholder lawsuit 
that was later dismissed. At the time, critics accused Anderson of having 
insider knowledge about certain drilling rights that were not listed for sale 
-- charges Anderson denied. The drilling rights were eventually sold back to 
Arco. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a cat and dog collection that still needs some sorting out," he says. 
"But it made good sense from the point of view of an independent company. . . . 
A small company can operate properties like that better than a big company." 
</P>
<P>
With the properties, Anderson reconstituted his old Hondo Co., with Lonrho 
holding a little less than half interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assuming Control 
</P>
<P>
Anderson assumed control of Pauley in January, 1988, when Anderson's Hondo Co. 
received 10 million shares, or about 77%, of Pauley's outstanding common stock, 
in exchange for which Pauley took over Hondo's oil and gas subsidiary. With 
other purchases, Hondo eventually ended up holding about 81% of Pauley's stock. 
</P>
<P>
In the merger, Pauley gained Hondo's sizable oil and gas reserves in the Arco 
properties. Pauley's reserves stood at 16.7 million barrels of oil and 108.7 
billion cubic feet of natural gas at the end of the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the company has pursued an aggressive drilling program, 
drilling about 39 new wells a year, Pagen said. About $18 million is slated for 
drilling in fiscal 1989, with $12 million going to new prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he intends to remain actively involved in the company's 
management, though he maintains a stiff travel schedule. He has cut back on 
many of his outside involvements, preferring to concentrate his activities in 
New Mexico. He has also sold off his foreign land holdings and most of his 
outside business interests. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has involved his two sons, Phelps, 38, and Robert B., 42, in the 
management of his new company. Each is also an officer of Hondo and owns about 
5% of that company. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I decided to go back into the business was my two very 
bright young sons," he says. Asked whether he'd like them to mirror his own 
career, he says simply, "That would please me very much."

BAN ON OFFSHORE OIL EXPLORATION FRUSTRATES FIRMS; 
</P>
<P>
A MORATORIUM WOULD POSTPONE RETURN ON HUGE SUMS ALREADY INVESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first thing that an oil company sinks into an offshore drilling project 
isn't a metal bit or a seismic probe. It's money. 
</P>
<P>
Under the best circumstances, a firm can expect to pour millions of dollars and 
seven to 10 years into a project before seeing any production -- or any return 
on its investment. 
</P>
<P>
For most oil companies, it's a calculated risk of doing business, particularly 
when offshore areas promise the best prospects for replacing ever-dwindling 
domestic supplies of crude. 
</P>
<P>
But now, a sweeping moratorium on offshore drilling is moving quickly through 
Congress, threatening to throw a major obstacle in the path of industry efforts 
to tap what officials believe is a potential reserve of as much as 7 billion 
barrels of oil. 
</P>
<P>
For some companies, the law would even further postpone any return on their 
already sizable investments in offshore prospecting. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the House passed to the Senate a proposed law that would postpone 
until at least October, 1990, any activity on proposed oil lease sales off the 
California coast. In addition, the measure would ban drilling in areas already 
leased off the coast of Alaska and Florida and would place about 84 million 
acres of the country's outer continental shelf out of the reach of oil 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Because the moratorium would delay pre-lease activity in California, oil 
companies would probably not have a chance until 1992 to bid on three potential 
lease sales -- 95 in Southern California, 91 in Northern California and 119 in 
Central California. 
</P>
<P>
That would place off limits areas where industry officials believe that they 
have the best hope of finding sizable new reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, some oil company executives argued that a moratorium could cost them 
money by further delaying projects in which they already have invested 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, proponents of the moratorium are less than sympathetic to the costs 
that oil companies may incur. 
</P>
<P>
"Public policy on offshore drilling should be decided on the merits of the 
environmental risk, not what it costs a company if they have to wait a little 
longer to be granted access to it," said Andy Palmer, director of the 
Washington office of the American Oceans Campaign, an environmental advocacy 
group based in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he argued, "if you balance it in the California case, on the 
offsetting side is the billions of dollars in tourist industry, commercial and 
sport fishing that might be placed at risk by this development." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, oil companies have sizable investments at stake. 
</P>
<P>
In Alaska, the law would put a stop to exploratory and other drilling in areas 
already leased in the North Aleutian basin area on the edge of Bristol Bay -- 
where Chevron, Mobil, Unocal and several other companies put down $95.4 million 
for the rights to drill for oil. Including other development costs, the 
companies' total investment in the area is more than $100 million, said Alan 
Powers, regional director in Alaska of the federal Minerals Management Service, 
which handles offshore leasing. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's share of the rentals and initial investment in the Alaska offshore 
leases amounts to nearly $18 million, said Richard J. Harris, general manager 
of the land department of Chevron U.S.A.'s Western Region. 
</P>
<P>
"The other cost, of course, is (from) all those people working on that," he 
said. "To be suddenly on hold for a year without knowing whether there will be 
another extension (of the moratorium) for the year makes it difficult to be 
organized or efficient at all in our operations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium would direct the Department of Interior to explore compensating 
the oil companies for their costs and consider buying back the leases. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, Unocal Corp. and its partners have invested $20 million in leases 
in the Pulley Ridge area of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, said Unocal spokesman 
Arthur Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil Oil Corp. has invested $33.2 million as its share of an investment with 
other partners in leases in the Pulley Ridge area, not including the costs of 
administration or seismic and other tests in preparation for drilling, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Those investments would be put on hold if the moratorium halts exploratory 
drilling in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the moratorium would postpone future lease sales until at least 
October, 1990, but would have no effect on ongoing exploratory or production 
drilling on existing leases, said Barry Toiv, spokesman for Rep. Leon E. 
Panetta (D-Monterey), who drafted the bill. After that, the moratorium could be 
reviewed and extended, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry executives are reluctant to discuss their strategies for putting 
together the highly competitive sealed bids for such lease sales. But they said 
an oil company generally spends several million dollars on geophysical tests 
and other studies to evaluate an area before making a bid. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a moratorium, all that money and effort could go for naught if the 
bid is inadequate. A moratorium simply complicates the matter -- when a sale is 
delayed, the studies may have to be recast in light of new information. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest headache . . . is spending money and effort and time figuring what 
to bid for these leases," said David Adilman, an oil and gas analyst with Data 
Resources Inc./McGraw-Hill in New York. "When there's no lease sale, it's a big 
drain." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield Co. is one of several major oil companies that may be 
interested in bidding on the California leases. 
</P>
<P>
"The work could still pay off if the moratorium is lifted next year," said Arco 
spokesman Albert Greenstein. "It's not like it's wasted effort at this point. . 
. . It's always a calculated gamble."

FOOTNOTES: CASHING IN ON REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The observation of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution has become 
tres chic around the world. That, of course, includes California. The topic is 
all over television and the public prints. It even prompted a major celebration 
on the UCLA campus. 
</P>
<P>
At this juncture comes media maven Paul Kagan with the latest wrinkle in the 
rush to pay homage to la belle France. Carmel, Calif.-based Paul Kagan 
Associates Inc. has announced that it has published the first of two 
newsletters -- "en Francais." It is "Bulletin de la TV Payante" (The Pay TV 
Newsletter). 
</P>
<P>
In truth, Kagan didn't specifically invoke the Revolution in beating the drums 
for this one. These publications, Kagan said, are in response to "repeated 
requests from the French market," where they are expected to be "essential to 
the French media professional" interested in American television affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Calling All Couch Potatoes 
</P>
<P>
How about a brand-new sofa -- for free? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Krause's Sofa Factory in Fremont, Calif., will build you one. But first, 
you have to help them find theirs -- a 31-foot-long, 500-pound forced-air sofa 
balloon that was spirited away during the Independence Day weekend from the 
rooftop of their store. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes five or six strong guys to move that sofa," said Nadar Almasi, 
Krause's store manager in Fremont. "How did they do it?" The missing sofa, 
which has been named "Maxine," is valued at $12,000. When Almasi reported the 
theft of the navy blue sofa to Fremont police, he said, "They laughed." 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if 'Maxine' has been beamed up by a UFO," said Doug Vunder, Krause's 
vice president of retail sales. "I'm heartbroken." 
</P>
<P>
A Reverse Brain Drain 
</P>
<P>
The brain drain that has affected Europe for decades, as qualified workers left 
for better paying jobs in the United States, is showing signs of reversing. 
</P>
<P>
Butler Services Group, a job shop, will arrive in Los Angeles this month to 
recruit about 35 aerospace engineers for jobs in England. The company is 
prepared to offer top engineers up to $112,000 per year for a 50-hour work 
week, according to Peter Sainsbury, Butler's operations director in Surrey, 
England. And they will throw in temporary accommodations and car rentals while 
you learn the difference between a spanner and the Big Spin. "We have exhausted 
the supply of software and flight systems engineers in Europe," Sainsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
In one respect, it is American business ingenuity that is helping to drain the 
nation's brain: Butler is a unit of North American Ventures Inc., based in 
Montvale, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Fitting Logo for Firm 
</P>
<P>
Some people might think that the new logo at one Los Angeles ad agency was 
purchased right off the supermarket shelf. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the logo comes complete with a bar code -- identical to those 
square patches of thick and thin black lines found on such grocery store items 
as soda crackers and soda pop. 
</P>
<P>
But the Universal Product Code for ad agency Davis, Ball &amp; Colombatto 
doesn't spell out a price. Rather, it translates into the agency's phone 
number. The logo -- and code -- will appear on all of the agency's stationery 
and brochures. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted something that illustrated what the agency stands for," said Brad 
Ball, president of the firm. After all, the agency creates ads for one of the 
biggest supermarket chains in town -- Ralphs Grocery Co.

Brazilian Speculator Charged: Speculator Naji Nahas, who sparked a crisis in 
Brazil's stock exchanges when he stopped payment on checks to brokers, has been 
charged with fraud and crimes against the economy, police said. The scandal 
forced authorities to close Brazil's stock and options markets June 12. 
Brokerage houses lost up to $500 million when Nahas stopped payment on his 
checks, and five of them had to be closed by the Central Bank because of 
losses. If convicted, Nahas could be sentenced to two to 10 years for 
manipulating exchange markets and up to five years for letting $29 million in 
checks bounce. Nahas says he was an innocent victim of maneuvers by market 
players.

In what government officials say is an unprecedented move, Chrysler Corp. is 
challenging the quality of medical care provided to dozens of injured workers 
at its now-closed assembly plant here and is refusing to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
The care provided to workers by certain physicians in the Kenosha-Racine area 
was "inappropriate, unreasonable and excessive," said David A. Lewsley, manager 
of worker's compensation for the auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler has assured workers that they won't be liable for unpaid bills and 
says its battle is with the doctors, not with the workers. 
</P>
<P>
A former United Auto Workers leader said the union approved of Chrysler's 
decision.

Perot Ordered to Show Cause: In Fairfax, Va., Circuit Court Judge William 
Plummer ordered H. Ross Perot's new company, Perot Systems Corp., to show cause 
why it should not be held in contempt of court for violating an earlier court 
order. Electronic Data Systems charged that on three occasions PSC violated an 
injunction issued by Plummer prohibiting PSC from "soliciting, negotiating for, 
entering into, or performing any contract or other business relationship" 
before Dec. 1, 1989, that "contemplates or calls for any profitable return at 
any point in time." Plummer issued the order Oct. 21 and made it permanent 
April 13. Under the conditions of his sellout agreement with EDS, Perot agreed 
not to compete with EDS until Dec. 1, 1989.

When Park Kyu Soon, 31, was about to take out her new car for the first time, 
her colleagues at the advertising agency where she works thought the occasion 
deserved a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
They embellished the antenna on the car, which a salesman had delivered to the 
company parking lot, with a bevy of ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
A designer at the agency made an elaborately lettered sign reading "Beginner" 
for her to tape to the back window. 
</P>
<P>
All 40 agency employees gathered to see her drive off. 
</P>
<P>
"With four of them 'instructing' me, I went for a test drive," she said. "They 
all joked that they hadn't taken out insurance." 
</P>
<P>
It was indeed an occasion for Park -- the first car she had bought. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought of owning a car while I was growing up," she said. "It was too 
natural not to own a car. No one in the neighborhood had one." 
</P>
<P>
Nor did many people anywhere in South Korea dream of owning a car until quite 
recently. In 1980, a mere 44,000 cars were sold in the nation of 43 million 
people. Five years ago sales barely exceeded 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, South Korea stands on the threshold of an "era of motorization." 
</P>
<P>
Without labor strife that has disrupted production, auto makers had expected to 
sell nearly 500,000 cars this year -- about 20% of them to Koreans who have 
never owned a car. The auto firms still might achieve that goal if they can 
persuade workers to make up the lost time. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the year, we expected a 40% growth in domestic sales," 
said Hong Tu Pyo, Hyundai's managing director of domestic marketing. "Now, we 
expect a 50% growth. But if we could produce the cars to match the demand, 
growth could be almost 60%." 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai, the nation's export leader in which Mitsubishi of Japan holds a 15% 
interest, has lowered its export goal and raised its domestic sales target and 
expects to sell more cars at home than abroad for the first time since 1984, 
Hong said. 
</P>
<P>
Barring future shutdowns, demand at home should continue to increase about 60% 
a year until at least 1992 before slowing to a more moderate increase, Hong 
said. Some economists see domestic sales of all motor vehicles reaching 2 
million a year by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Now Manageable 
</P>
<P>
In the first five months this year, the three major and two minor Korean auto 
makers sold 62.9% of their production at home -- a reversal from only 45.6% 
during the same period last year. Cars led the domestic boom, with sales rising 
42.9%. 
</P>
<P>
A high tariff of 25% on imports and an outright ban on sales of cars made in 
Japan are expected to limit the boom to domestic models. Last year, for 
example, the nation imported a mere 480 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Park paid $9,000 for her two-door coupe, but with interest on her loan 
included, she will pay about $12,000 over three years, she said. Monthly 
installment payments, gas, insurance, license plate fees and maintenance cost 
her about $375 a month, "which is a headache," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But with wages increasing all over South Korea, that kind of burden is now 
manageable for many middle-class Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
Auto salesmen and managers say Koreans like Park -- with a monthly income of 
about $1,500 (1 million won) are buying their first cars for $8,000 to $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular model produced by Kia Motors, in which Ford and Mazda own a 
minority interest, sells for around $6,800 and appeals to buyers with incomes 
of $1,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Junior executives in the lowest tier of management are now set to buy their 
first car, said Lee Jong Yol, a salesman for Daewoo Motors, a 50-50 joint 
venture between Daewoo Corp. and General Motors. Lee singles them out, he said, 
when he visits business offices, where 80% of his sales are made. 
</P>
<P>
"When you step into an office, the first thing you see is a row of ordinary 
employees at the front. Then, there is a row where the section chiefs sit. 
Behind them are the managers," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold Cars on Street 
</P>
<P>
"The first row is a waste of time. Most managers already own a car. So I 
concentrate on the section chiefs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said he has even sold cars on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Once, for example, he spotted a driver getting out of an old subcompact car, 
went up to him, presented his name card and said, "Don't you think it's time 
you bought a new car?" 
</P>
<P>
The man, who turned out to be a TV announcer, was interested. Lee showed him 
some brochures, and he signed a contract on the spot. Later, the announcer 
introduced Lee to several friends and relatives "and I sold cars to four of 
them," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Lee carries contracts with him at all times. "Going out without them," he 
explained, "would be like going to war without a weapon." 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of his customers, he said, are prosperous enough now to own two cars. 
Parking lots at one upper-middle-class apartment house complex in Seoul, for 
example, are so crowded that two-car families there are forced to double-park, 
leaving the brakes on their cars off so that attendants can push them back and 
forth to allow blocked cars to leave. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the takeoff in sales has not reached average factory workers 
-- although Lee said laborers with 10 years' experience receive enough pay to 
buy a car. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Daewoo's workers could afford Daewoo's cars, Kim Gou Han of the firm's 
market research department said: "Of course not." 
</P>
<P>
Koreans, he said, haven't yet entered the "motorization era" in which a car is 
regarded as a daily necessity. Average people still regard a car as a luxury, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Women Buyers 
</P>
<P>
"In Korea, only one in every 10 households can afford a car," Kim added. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said all his sales have been to white-collar workers, including a few 
women, and housewives who live in upper-middle-class neighborhoods. Average 
first-car buyers generally are in their mid-30s to mid-40s. 
</P>
<P>
Governments over the years reinforced the only-for-the-rich mentality with a 
series of taxes that doubled the retail price buyers had to pay for a car. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes, although still stiff, were cut last year. A third straight year of 12% 
real growth pushed per-capita income above $4,000 in 1988, and it was expected 
to climb to $4,700 this year. And although government officials and businessmen 
were complaining that wage increases of more than 60% since 1987 are 
threatening to kill the country's international competitiveness, the pay hikes 
have helped spur the car boom at home. 
</P>
<P>
Next year the domestic market promises to get its biggest shot-in-the-arm to 
date when auto makers come out with new 800cc-engine mini-cars. They will cost 
as little as $3,800, or less than half of today's most popular 1,500cc-engine 
models, opening the opportunity of owning a car to an entirely new income 
segment of the population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic, Accidents, Deaths 
</P>
<P>
A government edict banning new entries into passenger car production expired 
July 1, and at least two new entrants are expected to join the competition. 
</P>
<P>
The boom is bringing other new phenomena to South Korea -- traffic snarls, 
widespread parking violations and a soaring accident rate. 
</P>
<P>
Last year 11,563 persons were killed in auto accidents, up 60% from 1987. 
Finance Ministry statistics showed that 56.8 deaths occurred for every 10,000 
vehicles in use, compared to 2.6 in the United States and 1.9 in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry, as a result, revised the nation's auto insurance fees July 1, 
forcing all male drivers up to age 41 and all female drivers up to age 27 to 
pay premiums for insurance. Fees for more than half the nation's drivers were 
increased by more than $75 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic boom could not have come at a better time for the Korean industry, 
rescuing it from a 30% decline in overall exports, including a 40% plunge in 
shipments to the United States, so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers, however, say they have no intention of de-emphasizing exports. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't forget about the export market," said Kim Ki Tae, a Kia spokesman. 
"We intend to develop more models and strengthen our export marketing 
capability." Kia, he added, hopes to expand both domestic and export sales at 
an equal pace.

SECRETARIES ARE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
GREATER NEED AND GROWING SHORTAGE OF CLERICAL WORKERS HAS INCREASED THE 
COMPETITION FOR THEM, DRIVING THEIR SALARIES AND BENEFITS SHARPLY HIGHER

Karen Jorgensen, a Glendale-based recruiter, accepted a daunting assignment 
when she agreed to help Nylon Molding search for someone who would work closely 
with its president on a variety of tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the search would be time-consuming," said Jorgensen, president of a 
firm that provides executive search and personnel management services. "There's 
the worry that the person you find may not be right for the job." 
</P>
<P>
The task could have been very difficult, but the search was aborted when a 
promising purchasing agent already working for the Monrovia-based manufacturer 
accepted the job. Nylon Molding had found its secretary. 
</P>
<P>
It's no longer unusual for companies to ask recruiting companies for help in 
finding secretaries. Nylon Molding and many other Southland firms are taking 
note -- there's a severe shortage of applicants for secretarial jobs in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage stems from a growing demand for secretaries, combined with a 
diminishing labor pool. But inadequate education and the attraction of more 
glamorous pursuits are also contributing to the lack of candidates. In 
response, more and more companies are paying higher wages, offering perquisites 
normally reserved for executives and providing flexible working hours to woo 
and retain clerical help. In addition, they are luring away employees from 
other firms and paying their own employees a finder's fee for successful 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth in Demand Predicted 
</P>
<P>
Nylon Molding, which makes fasteners for aircraft and computer manufacturers, 
attracted an in-house candidate for the position of executive secretary by 
touting the job as a prestige position with high demands and a salary to match. 
Lori Armstrong was given a raise when she moved from the purchasing department 
to the secretarial post. 
</P>
<P>
The shortfall of clerical workers is reflected in many recent reports. For 
example, 225 California firms surveyed in June by the Los Angeles office of 
Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler &amp; Krupman, a management consultant, found that 
22% couldn't find enough adequate applicants for clerical positions. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 survey of 1,500 California firms by Thomas Temporaries, an Irvine-based 
provider of short-term clerical help, predicted a dramatic growth in demand in 
the Los Angeles area. In all, 40% of the respondents anticipated a need for 
additional clerical workers during the first six months of 1989. In contrast, 
only 27% of the respondents in a similar survey anticipated the need for staff 
increases during the first half of 1986. The increase in demand comes during a 
period of demographic change, said Jerrold Bratkovich, a Los Angeles-based 
consultant at the Hay Group, a management consulting firm specializing in human 
resources. The timing is unfortunate because of a decline in the number of 
people 21 to 35 years old, the prime ages for secretaries, Bratkovich said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a general reduction in applicants for most entry level jobs and that 
will continue for some years to come," he said, The pool of people available 
for clerical work is also shrinking because more women are opting for other 
occupations, according to Bonnie Nash, president of Thomas Temporaries. "Women 
who might have gone into clerical work are finding opportunities in customer 
services, sales and consulting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as Dead-End Job 
</P>
<P>
Many are avoiding the clerical field because it has a poor image, according to 
Faye Baxter, president of the California division of Professional Secretaries 
International, a Kansas City, Mo.-based association that tries to promote the 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a profession many men or women are going into because . . . it's seen 
as a dead-end job," Baxter said. "Secretaries are looking for recognition for 
their value as a team player and as a contributor to a company's growth and 
success." 
</P>
<P>
Many executives and secretaries alike say shortages also exist because area 
schools are not giving students the skills necessary to handle jobs such as 
letter writing. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the schools is catastrophic," said Thomas P. Christie, vice 
president and director of human resources at Pasadena-based Century Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn. "Some companies are giving remedial help with reading 
and writing. Some secretaries can't spell. You ask some to prepare a letter and 
find they can't write." 
</P>
<P>
To attract candidates inside and outside the company, more firms are offering 
incentives, Jorgensen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend is to offer awards based on overall office production and individual 
performance -- incentives similar to ones offered executives," she said. "Some 
companies are offering profit sharing, stock and bonuses if certain objectives 
are met." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the demand and bidding, wages for secretaries in Southern 
California are 15% to 17% higher than pay levels in the rest of the country, 
labor studies indicate. Wages for secretaries employed in downtown Los Angeles 
are generally 4% higher than the pay levels in the rest of the Southland, 
according to labor specialists. They say downtown employers generally must pay 
more because people with secretarial skills need an incentive to work downtown 
because they can find work near home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adjustments Necessary 
</P>
<P>
"The more experienced secretaries are getting substantial wages," Jorgensen 
said. "Companies have to pay secretaries more in this area." 
</P>
<P>
The secretary shortage is forcing adjustments on employers and employees. 
Sometimes employers and job candidates do not adequately conform to the 
realities of the new job market. Management consultants cite these incidents. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County manufacturer, unable to find an applicant on the West Coast 
for a high-level clerical position, found a candidate on the East Coast. The 
candidate accepted an offer, agreeing to a wage and benefit package that 
included free use of a company car. 
</P>
<P>
During a cross-country drive to the new job, the prospective new employee began 
to feel heady and stopped periodically to negotiate improvements in the 
benefits. Company executives were concerned that they had hired a very 
demanding new clerical worker, but agreed to the requests. Finally, when the 
prospective new employee asked the company for assurances that the promised car 
would be a convertible, the company withdrew the offer. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent Hollywood company offered about $50,000 a year for an executive 
secretary position. However, the company has been unable to retain an employee 
in the position because the supervisor, unhappy about the secretary's 
relatively high salary, is "too demanding." 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of candidates for clerical positions has awakened an appreciation 
of the value of the occupation among executives, some management consultants 
say. However, some secretaries believe that attitudes are changing too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"Not many women want to go into this (occupation) if they're qualified to do 
something else," said Sandra Shaw, a Glendale legal secretary. This causes 
secretaries to change jobs often, added Shaw, who has been a secretary for 20 
years. "They walk out of one job and into another and think it's going to be 
different -- and it's not. . . . We're professionals and we should be treated 
as professionals." 
</P>
<P>
As the shortage grows, more companies are willing to lure valued secretaries 
away from other firms, Christie said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finder's Fees 
</P>
<P>
"Raiding has become an ordinary part of the (personnel mangement) job at some 
companies," Christie said. 
</P>
<P>
While some companies rely on personnel managers to recruit, others are offering 
their employees incentives to find job candidates for clerical positions. For 
example, employees at First Federal Savings get $200 for recruiting an 
employee, said Jeanette Parr, vice president and director of resources at the 
West Covina-based institution. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it sometimes takes time to find candidates, Parr said. She said an 
administrative support position requiring typing and phone-answering skills 
recently went unfilled for four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Parr said some potential candidates shy away from clerical positions because 
the occupation has become more technically demanding. For example, more 
secretaries are required to work on computers. 
</P>
<P>
First Federal recently trained Robin Ogden to operate a computer. Ogden, who 
primarily handles word processing chores for a variety of supervisors, said she 
enjoys her work. 
</P>
<P>
"I've often heard women say, 'I don't want to be just a secretary'," Ogden 
said. "More prestige and responsibility has to be associated with the job." 
</P>
<P>
Lori Armstrong, who made the unusual move from the purchasing department to 
executive secretary at Nylon Molding, expressed a similar sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who had worked in clerical positions at other companies for four 
years before a two-year stint in purchasing, said she took the secretarial 
position because it involved a wide range of duties. She said she helps 
executives coordinate trade shows and direct mail and advertising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a step up," she said. "There's still a lot of typing and 
copying, but . . . the president sometimes bounces ideas off me. I feel like 
I'm part of the executive team."

MEMO: HIRING CLERICAL HELP 
</P>

By GEORGE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An increasing number of Southland companies have been seeking information on 
techniques to retain and attract clerical employees. 
</P>
<P>
Labor specialists at one management consulting firm -- the Los Angeles offices 
of Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler &amp; Krupman -- are accustomed to getting 
requests for advice on work force matters such as legal liabilities and 
benefits. Now, they're advising local firms on matters relating to the 
recruitment of clerical workers, said Joel Kelly, a partner at the company. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said the company has the expertise and the experience to give good 
advice. "We've had some (clerical) shortages from time to time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recent state studies predict a large number of jobs and job openings in the 
clerical field. There were 1.3 million clerical jobs in 1985 in California, 
according to the California Employment Development Department. The total will 
grow to about 1.6 million by 1995, an increase of about 22%, the department 
says. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there will have been 449,080 clerical job openings during that 10-year 
span. 
</P>
<P>
Some suppliers of temporary clerical help say more companies are luring away 
temporary workers with offers of full-time jobs. However, Grace Brown, who 
works for several temporary agencies, says she won't accept any offers. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is one of many secretaries who prefer working for companies on a 
temporary basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the flexibility," she explained. "I decide when I want to work. It 
allows me to do some editing for a friend who writes books, and I handle some 
desktop publishing . . . . I've had a lot of offers, but they (companies) can't 
get me to leave this. It's really a way of being self-employed." GEORGE WHITE

The sign in front of the nondescript commercial building on Harbor Boulevard in 
central Anaheim identifies it as the site of the Catholic Charities of Orange 
County Refugee Job Program. Inside, several dozen clients, predominantly

In a small office inside the building, program director Karen Winne holds forth 
about the mission of the agency -- Orange County's oldest refugee job program 
-- and the challenges that it faces. 
</P>
<P>
Winne, who holds a bachelor's degree in political science from the University 
of Maryland and a master's degree in political science from UC Berkeley, 
recently was named chairwoman of the Orange County Refugee Forum, a coalition 
of 30 private organizations and government agencies that deal with refugees and 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
She seems uniquely suited to her role, which is persuading refugees they need 
to learn English and to accept jobs that they might never have considered in 
their native countries, and then to persuade businesses to hire her clients. 
</P>
<P>
For training, Winne notes with a laugh, she spent three years in Saudi Arabia, 
where, to keep her sanity in the restrictive Muslim society, she organized 
projects for the international consular community, honing tremendous persuasive 
skills in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Struck by her demonstrated prowess as a persuader, Catholic Charities of Orange 
County hired Winne in 1986 as a job developer. Last year, she was named 
director of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The basic task of the program is to help refugees meld into the American 
culture and to get them out of the welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
As a by-product, Winne and her staff turn out a consistent flow of willing 
entry-level workers who can help Orange County's beleaguered employers cope 
with a two-year run of low unemployment that has created an employee scarcity 
in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Times staff writer John O'Dell, Winne discussed the 
mission of the refugee job center and her perception of how the county's 
business community is receiving the continuing influx of Southeast Asians, 
Middle Easterners and Eastern Europeans who make up the bulk of her clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Q. First things first. Does one need to be a Roman Catholic to use the center's 
services? 
</P>
<P>
A. Oh, goodness no! I'm a Methodist, and two of the other executives are 
charismatic Protestants. Most of our clients are Vietnamese Buddhists. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So there is no religious outreach connected with the program? 
</P>
<P>
A. None at all. In fact, we are completely self-supporting and get no help from 
the Diocese of Orange at all. We run on state and county and federal contracts, 
and we have to make it on our own, or we go under. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How long has Catholic Charities had a job program in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. Since 1976. We were the first refugee job center in the county. The first 
waves of refugees started coming in 1975, and we opened our doors in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you determine who is a refugee? 
</P>
<P>
A. A refugee is a person who flees his country for political, religious or 
racial reasons. Under U.S. law today, that covers people from all of Southeast 
Asia, all of Eastern Europe, all of the Middle East (except Saudi Arabia and 
Jordan), and Ethiopia and the Sudan. And that is really about it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Nobody else? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nobody else. According to our laws, South Americans and Central Americans 
come here as immigrants, not refugees. And immigrants come for economic 
reasons, so they get only an extremely limited amount of help from government. 
Basically, they get emergency medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the scope of the job programs offered by Catholic Charities? 
</P>
<P>
A. I actually run two refugee job programs under state contracts that are 
administered by the county. One is the TAP, or targeted assistance program, 
which deals more with long-term welfare cases, the more difficult clientele. 
Then there is the Refugee Employment and Social Services Program. It deals with 
a lot of younger, single Vietnamese. We do job placement, counseling and 
vocational English as a second language, or ESL, classes. We also have two 
regular ESL classes under the TAP program and we have a program that teaches 
English to Hispanics trying to qualify for immigration amnesty. The vocational 
ESL classes are run because when clients are referred for job placement, they 
must take six hours a day of vocational English. And this is after having 
finished three months of regular ESL. The vocational classes are really 
job-geared. The students are taught to use time clocks, to fill out job 
application forms and go on job interviews. We work with them on a one-to-one 
basis to try to overcome some of the cultural differences and really let them 
know what the American workplace is like. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And are there any other job programs? 
</P>
<P>
A. We have one in Santa Ana, at the Carpenter's Union Hall. That's more of an 
informal program that is open to almost anyone in need. They place about 50 
people in jobs each month, and about 80% of the clientele is Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Orange County is a very affluent community with a very low unemployment 
rate. Employers in some areas complain that they cannot find entry-level 
workers because people won't work for the wages the employers can pay. How does 
that affect your success in placing refugees in jobs? 
</P>
<P>
A. We do pretty well. Most of our people are looking at entry-level work. There 
has been a decline in electrical assembly jobs lately, and the women, 
especially, want them because they are clean, quiet and have status. They write 
home to Vietnam that they are electronic specialists. Jobs like that have a lot 
of status because of the importance Vietnamese place on education. We had one 
case where a client was offerred $8.50 an hour to do janitorial work but turned 
it down and took $3.35 to do electronic assembly instead. The status of a job, 
and the fact that having it shows some education, at least in their minds, is 
more important than the wage. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What other jobs do you place clients in? 
</P>
<P>
A. After electronic assembly, the most sought after are machine operators, then 
regular production line and packaging. We also have a lot of Vietnamese women 
going into manicuring. It has some status and is easier to get into than 
cosmetology. The Vietnamese still shy away from any kind of fast-food and 
home-service jobs. And it is almost impossible to place them in hotels. It is 
because of the stigma. In Vietnam, a maid is an outcast. So I've never been 
able to interest a Southeast Asian in any kind of home-service work. We also 
can't place them in nursing. Part of that is the English, but it is also that 
they are so tiny they can't handle the physical aspects of turning and moving 
these huge Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is the county's employer pool fairly open to refugees? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think all the job developers here have much better luck in small companies 
with 10 to 50 jobs. They seem to be much more willing to go out on a limb a 
little more. They take the chance and will spend the extra time that is 
necessary when they hire refugees or immigrants. And it does take extra time 
because employers do have to work with language and cultural differences. The 
big companies just aren't very receptive to that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there areas of the county where the job scene is especially good or bad? 
</P>
<P>
A. It is easier for a refugee to get hired in north Orange County because the 
transportation system is better. Employers are screaming for people in south 
Orange County and just can't get them because the workers can't get to the 
jobs. And south Orange County jobs pay a good bit more. An employer down there 
will pay $6.50 an hour for jobs that go for $4.25 to $4.50 in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You think they'd change their hours to fit the bus schedules if they really 
are that desperate. 
</P>
<P>
A. I know. But they don't. So the only people we can really place in the 
Tustin-Irvine-Newport area are those who live within walking distance of Red 
Hill Avenue, because there's a bus line down there. We get cries for help from 
hotels, like the Newport Marriott and the rest of them, but we can't get people 
down there. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I thought you said most of your clients won't work in hotels anyway. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. But the wages they are offering down there are so good, we might be 
able to talk some into it if there was transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So transportation is that important? 
</P>
<P>
A. Basically, there are three main barriers to employment for refugees and 
immigrants. First is the language, but that is not as crucial as the others: 
Cultural orientation and transportation. The biggest problem is transportation. 
These people cannot afford cars so they must rely on public transportation. And 
most of the buses don't start until about 5:45 a.m. But a lot of the factories 
in the county start at 6:30 or 7. And even going just across Anaheim can take 
three bus changes, which eats up an hour or more, so people can't get to work 
on time. And now, a lot of factories are turning to four-day weeks with 10-hour 
days and they start as early as 6 a.m. That is just deathly as far as trying to 
place refugees and immigrants because I can't get anybody to work before 7. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Just because of transportation, or are there some cultural factors at work? 
</P>
<P>
A. It is mostly because of transportation. When these factories start at 6 or 
6:30, I just can't get anyone there who doesn't have a car. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You said big companies didn't seem able or willing to take the extra time to 
work with refugees. Can you give me an example? 
</P>
<P>
A. Disneyland. I've had a good many dealings with the head of personnel there. 
They are nice people and seem willing to work with us, but Disneyland has this 
crazy setup where they will only hire part time, not full time, and they put 
them on night shifts for the first month or two. So I can't get people there 
because of the bus schedules. Many of my refugees want to work there. It is a 
popular employer and has status, but we have never placed a refugee at 
Disneyland because they won't relax that rule about putting them on the night 
shift first. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The inflexibility of bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. You know that Disneyland imported about 1,000 workers from other states 
this summer to fill all the jobs they had? Well, they wouldn't have had to. We 
could have filled everything they wanted right from our offices if they had 
been willing to bend on that hours requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I know we are basically talking about refugees and immigrants, but what if 
you are a native-born, English-speaking person who needs job help? Are there 
any similar programs? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, we can place you out of Carpenter's Hall. That program is funded from 
a variety of sources and is not limited. Here, in the refugee program, we are 
limited to refugees. Orange County also has finally signed up for GAIN. That's 
the state's Greater Avenues for Independence program. It provides up to two 
years' vocational training and ESL for anyone on welfare. When GAIN gets 
rolling in the county in 1990, there will be a lot of vocational training 
available, and the program actually will fund adequate child care so mothers 
can participate. There is also the Job Corps, which is a very good program but 
is limited to people from 18 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Getting back to your programs, how many people do you serve? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, we place 45 to 50 a month from Carpenter's Hall in Santa Ana, and that 
represents 100 to 150 contacts each month. Most of those are in production, 
assembly and packaging jobs, and a lot of the younger Vietnamese and Hispanics 
get placed in restaurant work. In the refugee program, we get about 35 
referrals a month to the office in Anaheim and about 45 a month to the office 
in Santa Ana. We place about 13 to 15 people a month in jobs from both offices. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some of the difficulties you run into? 
</P>
<P>
A. My staff can place almost anyone, except people over 50. We just cannot do 
it. Nobody wants to hire the older workers. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How bout racial or ethnic discrimination? 
</P>
<P>
A. The only problems I've seen have been with Ethiopians and Iranians. The few 
Ethiopians that come here are well-educated, refined, hard-working and want 
jobs, but it is very tough. We get teachers, civil engineers, the upper crust 
of Ethiopian society, but because Orange County employers have a bad image of 
blacks, they don't want to hire them. With Iranians, the problem is more 
political than racial. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Describe a typical client. 
</P>
<P>
A. A single Vietnamese, 20 to 35 years old, with a fair level of English. They 
can usually read and write quite well, but their spoken English is heavily 
accented. That's because they get some ESL training in the refugee camps, but 
the instructors there have heavy accents. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kinds of education do they have? 
</P>
<P>
A. That has changed. It used to be that most had at least some college, but now 
we see mostly high school graduates, or even those who just went through 10th 
grade. In the last couple of months, the refugees have been coming straight 
from the camps in Thailand and not going through the two- to five-year holding 
process, so they are coming in with much lower English skills and 
culturalization than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How are they cleared to leave the camps in Thailand and elsewhere and come 
here? 
</P>
<P>
A. Refugee camp authorities look for younger, physically healthy people with 
some education. That causes real tragedies with the older Vietnamese, because 
these people want to stay together as a family group, and they don't get passed 
if they are over 50. So they lie about their ages. That clears it so whole 
family groups can come into this country. But then they come in as much younger 
than they really are, and when they try to apply for Social Security they find 
they have to work until their mid-70s because they lied about their age. One 
man who works here is listed as 59, but he's really 64. So he'll be 71 before 
he can retire. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You said health is also an important point. Does that mean that every 
refugee who comes here is healthy? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. They get fake medical records. You would too. They are desperate, so 
they get false records that hide tuberculosis and other serious illnesses. And 
a lot also are victims of post-traumatic stress disorder and they come here and 
all sorts of symptoms develop. The culture shock, after all, is tremendous. And 
the stress takes it out on their bodies. We see lots of cases of chronic 
backache, insomnia and headaches. That's one reason we take several months for 
cultural and vocational training. It doesn't work well to try to place them in 
jobs immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Q. We've mentioned cultural differences several times. What are the major ones 
that have to be dealt with? 
</P>
<P>
A. Vietnamese do not speak up in job interviews. They are apt to be very 
passive, very quiet. So we tell them they have to speak up, to let the employer 
know what you want. Most of our clients, when they come to us, have never 
filled out an application, have never had a job interview. In their own 
country, they are hired through family firms, through a connection. So they 
don't know what it means to job-hunt. And they are not geared to time clocks. 
They don't realize the American employers really don't like it if you are late. 
We have to work on the whole concept of time. A lot of refugees, particularly 
Middle Easterners, have just no sense of time at all. They come to work at any 
hour that they think is convenient. We also talk to the ones with higher 
English about things like income taxes and the fact that it is really a 
cutthroat world out there and that seniority really doesn't count anymore. We 
have to tell them that in America, people are laid off at anytime with no 
notice and that there is no security here like in their home countries, where 
they expected to work in one job all their lives. And that upsets them very 
much, because basically, they want to come and hire on with one company and 
stay there the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So what do employers need to expect, and to do, to make use of the refugees 
you are trying to find jobs for? 
</P>
<P>
A. They have got to be more flexible on hours. And I wish they would not be so 
set on not hiring two or more from the same family. If a refugee family scrapes 
up enough to get a car, they need to share it. Their cultural orientation is so 
family- and extended clan-oriented that for us to place four or five family 
members in a company would probably make that a permanent placement. It would 
go on forever because all the family members would be working there. But 
American employers have no concept of that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do the county's ethnic business communities support your efforts? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. They go out of their way to hire members of their own community. But we 
find that most of it, especially in the Vietnamese community, is family members 
hiring family members. So most of the Vietnamese that come through here are 
placed with American companies. Actually, most of our Vietnamese clients tell 
us they don't want to work for a Vietnamese because Vietnamese bosses are too 
tough.

A judge today rejected defense efforts to subpoena Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
to testify in the Wedtech bribery trial about a report lambasting his 
predecessor Edwin Meese III's unethical conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came as Meese wrapped up his testimony at the racketeering trial of 
E. Robert Wallach, Wedtech's lawyer, in U.S. District Court. Meese's one-time 
lawyer and friend is accused with two others of taking $2 million in Wedtech 
stock payoffs and using his influence with Meese to get lucrative defense 
contracts for Wedtech. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach's lawyers urged U.S. District Judge Richard Owen to allow them to 
subpoena Thornburgh, promising he would testify that he refused to adopt an 
internal report by the Office of Professional Responsibility that accused Meese 
of violating government ethical standards. Owen quashed the subpoena, however, 
saying Thornburgh's testimony would be "irrelevant."

Hurricane Dalilia swirled toward Hawaii today on a course that would take it 
150 miles south of the state's southernmost island, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything can happen. The way it looks now we may get a little from it, but not 
much," said Edmund Manning of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center here. "But 
then you can't be too optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
At 2 a.m. today, the hurricane was 830 miles east-southeast of Hawaii Island, 
southernmost in the chain, moving west-northwest at 20 m.p.h., Manning said. 
Its maximum sustained wind speed was 75 m.p.h.. A storm is classified a 
hurricane when that speed reaches 74 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
At that speed and course, the hurricane was expected to pass south of Hawaii 
Island, the "Big Island," on Tuesday night.

20,000 FARMERS TO RECEIVE NOTICES TO RESTRUCTURE LOANS OR LOSE LAND

The government's main agricultural lender is about to tell 20,000 farmers that 
they must act quickly to avoid foreclosure on delinquent loans, an Agriculture 
Department official said today. 
</P>
<P>
The notices to be mailed in four to six weeks are a sign that many farmers are 
still hurting from financial woes that have dragged under tens of thousands 
during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the problems in agriculture have not been corrected," said Keith 
Smalley, a program official for the department's Farmers Home Administration, 
which is known as the farm lender of last resort. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers who receive the notices will be given 45 days to declare their interest 
in restructuring their delinquent loans. If they do not respond, they face 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
The lending agency sent similar notices in November to 66,426 farmers whose 
delinquent loans had accumulated over several years. During that time the 
agency was barred by a court order from foreclosing.

In what Santa Ana police described today as another in a series of gang 
murders, two men approached a parked car and one opened fire with a handgun, 
killing a 16-year-old boy inside the car. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokeswoman said the attack just before midnight Sunday occurred at 
the corner of Spruce and Willits streets, where a man, two women and the 
teen-ager were inside a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said two men approached the car, an argument broke out and one 
of the men fired at least three times, striking the boy once in the chest. The 
boy died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Police withheld the names of the victim, who they said lived in Orange, and 
others in the car. The investigation has been turned over to the gang

'GROSS INTERFERENCE,' CHINA SAYS OF SUMMIT STATEMENT

<P>
China today denounced the seven leading industrialized nations for their "gross 
interference" in calling on China's Communist leaders to end their crackdown on 
participants in the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
The government also protested that its embassy in Paris was attacked for the 
second time since the crackdown and that the bicentennial parade in the French 
capital last week included Chinese pro-democracy students. 
</P>
<P>
A front-page editorial in the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, 
called on the "Group of Seven" to follow a foreign policy based on economic and 
strategic considerations and not by judging other nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Damaged China's Interests' 
</P>
<P>
"The actions taken by the Chinese government have in no way offended the West 
or any other country," it said. "The problem arises simply because certain 
countries, out of their own likes and dislikes and their sense of value, have 
in a broad scope directly damaged China's interests and dignity with words and 
deeds. 
</P>
<P>
"The near-sighted practice of keeping China away from the world community may 
not only undermine world peace and stability, but hurt the interests of the 
Western countries as well." 
</P>
<P>
The United States, Great Britain, West Germany, Italy, France, Japan and Canada 
included their comments on China in a communique issued at the end of the Paris 
summit this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Official Chinese news reports on the summit did not mention the portion of the 
communique dealing with China, but the People's Daily editorial was read on the 
radio and the official New China News Agency issued a full English translation. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial did not quote from the statement but said it "made unwarranted 
charges" based on the seven nations' "so-called values."

The Holy See and predominantly Roman Catholic Poland today re-established full 
diplomatic relations, the first time the Vatican has forged such ties with a 
Warsaw Pact nation. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the Vatican and Poland's state-run news agency said 
relations, cut by the Communists who took power in Poland in 1945, are at the 
level of ambassador by Poland and apostolic nunciature by the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the names of the ambassador and the papal nuncio will be announced 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The way was paved for establishment of full relations between Pope John Paul 
II's native Poland and the Vatican in May after the Polish Parliament passed a 
law giving the Roman Catholic Church legal status for the first time since 
1944. 
</P>
<P>
The Sejm (Parliament) also passed two other laws establishing freedom of 
worship for all creeds and the church's right to build churches, teach religion 
and establish and run Catholic schools. 
</P>
<P>
Church-state relations were marked by bitter conflict after World War II and 
were strained by the Pope's fervent support of the Solidarity free trade union.

ISRAEL'S SHARON URGES 'ELIMINATION' OF ARAFAT

Industry Minister Ariel Sharon called on the government today to "eliminate" 
PLO chief Yasser Arafat to end the Palestinian uprising and revive the Middle 
East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in this small Israeli town on a strategic plateau 
captured from Syria, Sharon renewed his demands for strong steps to end the 
19-month Palestinian uprising, which has claimed the lives of 565 Palestinians 
and 36 Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to stop using slogans, dishing out promises and handing out 
tranquilizers. The time has come to deal with terror and violence," Sharon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Are in a War' 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are in a war, it's a different kind of war but a war," he said. 
"The most important thing is to restore law and order, to bring an end to 
terror and violence called the intifada (Arabic for uprising)." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud Party, 
said the government must also "eliminate the heads of the terrorist 
organizations, first of all, Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
Unless this is done, he said, "I do not see any real possibility of arriving at 
peace or starting a peace process." 
</P>
<P>
It was not Sharon's first threat against the chief of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. On Jan. 28, he said on Israel radio that "there will be no peace 
as long as Arafat lives." 
</P>
<P>
A 61-year-old retired general, Sharon is also a former defense minister who 
spearheaded Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon to rout PLO guerrilla strongholds 
from that country. He was forced out of the post in 1983 when an Israeli 
inquiry commission found him indirectly responsible for the slayings of 
hundreds of Palestinians by Israeli-backed forces in the Sabra and Chattilla 
refugee camps in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers today blew up the homes of two 
Palestinians suspected of fatally stabbing an Israeli building contractor on 
Friday, the army said.

BUSH VOWS CLOSER SOVIET TIES TO HELP EAST BLOC REFORMS

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush said today that a new world is in sight and he vowed to aid 
reform in Eastern Europe by improving U.S. ties with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, as when the Pilgrims left this city, a new world lies within our 
reach," Bush said in remarks at the Dutch town from where many of America's 
17th-Century Pilgrim fathers sailed for the New World across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who made a dramatic visit to the Iron Curtain countries of Poland and 
Hungary last week to encourage fledgling political and economic reform 
movements, pledged to seek "an international climate in which reform can 
succeed in the Communist countries." 
</P>
<P>
"That is why America's relations with the Soviet Union are so important. 
Improved relations with the U.S.S.R. reduce pressure on the nations of Eastern 
Europe -- especially those on the cutting edge of reform," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Bush declared that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's bid for economic 
cooperation with the West was "the latest example of the Soviets moving in our 
direction, coming our way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's Letter 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a letter from the Soviet leader to the economic summit of 
the major non-communist powers. The letter delivered to French President 
Francois Mitterrand during the Paris summit Saturday proposed closer economic 
ties between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
The first U.S. President to visit the Netherlands, Bush repeated recent 
assurances that Moscow had nothing to fear from reform among its Eastern Bloc 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who has said he wants to move beyond the post-war policy of "containment" 
under which the West sought to bottle up communism, declared today that his aim 
was European unity. 
</P>
<P>
"The new world we seek is a commonwealth of free nations working in concert -- 
a world where more and more nations enter a widening circle of freedom," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bush and his wife, Barbara, had tea at Nooreheinde Palace with Queen 
Beatrix and Prince Claus. Bush then met privately with Dutch Prime Minister 
Ruud Lubbers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grueling Tour 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands was the last stop on a grueling 10-day European tour that Bush, 
65, conceded had worn him out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of running out of gas," Bush told a press conference in Paris on 
Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
In Leiden, Bush placed a wreath at a memorial to John Robinson, pastor of the 
Pilgrim community that sent about 50 of its members to America on the Mayflower 
in 1620. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is said to be a descendant of Mayflower passenger William Bradford. 
Bradford took refuge in Leiden because of religious persecution in England. He 
lived in the Netherlands for 13 years before sailing to America. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was to return to Washington on Tuesday.

BUSINESS INVENTORIES RISE .7%; SALES FLAT

Business inventories rose 0.7% in May while sales were virtually flat, the 
government said today in further signs of slackening economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and back lots climbed 
to a seasonally adjusted $776.9 billion in May following a 0.8% rise in April. 
</P>
<P>
Business sales, meanwhile, increased a minuscule 0.02% to a seasonally adjusted 
$517.9 billion after rising 2.0% in April. Sales had held steady in March after 
falling 0.9% in February, the steepest decline since January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
When not accompanied by increases in sales, rising inventories could threaten a 
recession by prompting manufacturers to cut back production until stockpiled 
goods are sold. 
</P>
<P>
The May figures were further signs of a slowing economy, prompted by Federal 
Reserve credit-tightening measures designed to halt inflation. Business 
inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as production 
outpaces demand. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's retail sales figures for June, released Friday, 
showed a 0.4% decline as consumer spending remained sluggish, particularly for 
cars and other more costly durable goods. Sales also dropped 0.1% in May, 
producing the first monthly back-to-back drop since the September-October 
period of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The automobile industry has seen a recent buildup of unsold vehicles, and the 
Commerce Department said inventories rose 0.9% in May. It said sales were off 
1.8% from April. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesalers registered the only sales increase in May, up 0.5%.

Many major cities won't be able to comply with federal limits on smog-causing 
pollutants before the year 2000, according to a study released today. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to Congress, the Office of Technology Assessment painted a grimmer 
picture of the outlook for urban smog reduction than was offered by President 
Bush in his proposals made in July for improving the nation's air quality. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had said his proposals by the year 2005 would bring all but about 20 
cities into compliance with the standard for ozone, which is created when 
volatile organic compounds from vehicle exhaust and other sources mix in 
sunlight with nitrogen oxides that are formed by the burning of fossil fuels 
such as petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Technology Assessment, which spent two years studying the matter, 
said prospects for ozone reduction are much less bright, particularly in cities 
such as Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco, Boston, Baltimore, St. Louis and 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about 30 to 45 cities by the year 2000 that will still be out of 
compliance," Bob Friedman, director of the OTA study, said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman said it will take another 20 years or more before some cities, such as 
Los Angeles, Houston and New York, will be able to meet federal air quality 
standards.

A religious group today announced a one-year boycott of the Mennen Co. and 
Clorox Corp. for advertising on television programs full of "sex, violence and 
profanity." 
</P>
<P>
The boycott by Christian Leaders for Responsible Television, or CLeaR-TV, asked 
consumers not to buy products such as bleach and deodorant from the two 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The group said it asked more than 500 companies that advertise on network 
television not to sponsor certain programs during the "sweeps" period of April 
27 through May 24, when the popularity of network programming is gauged. 
Results from monitoring in 33 states "showed that Mennen and Clorox ignored 
CLeaR-TV's request not to advertise on programs high in incidents of sex, 
violence and profanity during the monitoring period," said Billy Melvin, 
chairman of the group. Programs that the group found particularly offensive 
included "Miami Vice," "Tour of Duty" and "Midnight Caller," Melvin said.

Ford Motor Co. will recall almost 1.3 million cars that violate federal 
pollution-control standards due to a faulty part, the Environmental Protection 
Agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said Ford will begin notifying owners of the problem July 24, 
starting with owners in California. Because of the large number of vehicles 
involved, the recall will be conducted in stages through February, 1990, the 
EPA said. 
</P>
<P>
The cars have a faulty part in the fuel injector. Dealers will replace it free 
of charge with an improved fuel injector, the EPA said, and may be required to 
replace the catalytic converter, the exhaust gas sensor and the electronic 
engine control processor. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it discovered the fault, which causes excessive emissions of 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, during testing of 1985 and 1986 model Fords. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles to be recalled are 364,000 1985 Ford 2.3-liter Mercury Tempo and 
Topaz; 339,000 1986 Ford 2.3-liter and 2.5-liter Tempo, Taurus, Taurus wagon, 
Topaz and Sable, and 579,000 Ford 2.3-liter, 2.5-liter and 1.9-liter Tempo, 
Taurus, Taurus wagon, Escort, Escort wagon, EXP, Topaz, Sable, Lynx and Lynx 
wagon of the 1987 model year.

SCHRAMM OPEN TO NFL'S PROPOSALS;

EX-COWBOYS CHIEF WOULD CONSIDER INTERIM COMMISSIONER POST

Former Dallas Cowboys President Tex Schramm said today that although he would 
be reluctant to act as interim NFL commissioner, he would listen to whatever 
proposal the league owners might offer him while they search for a permanent 
successor to Pete Rozelle. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was announced this morning that three members of the dissident 
owners' faction will be included in the process of finding Rozelle's 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Both Schramm and former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach will be nominated 
for the commissioner's job Tuesday, when NFL owners gather in Chicago. (See 
Sports, Part III). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hedged on Response 
</P>
<P>
Staubach, in a statement released from his real estate office, said he has no 
desire to become commissioner. Schramm, however, hedged when asked if he might 
consider the job on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had 39 years of association with the National Football League," Schramm 
said. "It is by far the better part of my life. I have a tremendous emotional 
feeling as far as the league is concerned. I would do anything I could to help 
the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a search committee made up of veteran NFL owners 
recommended New Orleans President Jim Finks as the new commissioner. Eleven 
dissident owners abstained when Finks' name was put up for a vote, preventing 
him from obtaining the needed 19 votes. 
</P>
<P>
The dissidents were to meet tonight to ratify a plan that would allow them to 
get together with selection committee members Tuesday at the owners' meeting, 
originally called to announce plans for a new international spring league. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lynn, president of the Minnesota Vikings and one of the leaders of the 
dissident faction, said today that Finks continues to be an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, Lynn, Edward DeBartolo Jr. of San Francisco and Patrick 
Bowlen of Denver will meet with three members of the selection committee, 
headed by Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and Lamar Hunt of Kansas City. 
That meeting could take place Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Also included will be representatives of Heidrich and Struggles, the talent 
search firm that cut the list of candidates from 101 names at the start to six 
finalists and finally to Finks. The expanded group will look at the material 
that Heidrich and Struggles and the search committee used to arrive at the New 
Orleans president as its choice. 
</P>
<P>
Schramm, who left the Cowboys to become chief executive officer of the newly 
created World League of American Football, will attend Tuesday's owners' 
meeting in behalf of the new league.

Staubach, meanwhile, said although he is flattered at the prospect of having 
his name considered for commissioner, he would not accept the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great deal of gratitude and respect for the NFL, and it is an 
attractive thought to be considered for the commissioner," Staubach said. 
"However, at this time my life is consumed with building my real estate company 
on a national basis, and I am committed to this goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the challenge of the real estate business, and I am enjoying it. I will 
have to say, 'no.' "

OREGON READIES LOTTERY ON NFL POINT SPREAD

The Oregon Lottery Commission today approved draft rules that would make Oregon 
the only state to run a lottery contest based on point spreads of National 
Football League games. 
</P>
<P>
The commission endorsed the new game despite the objections of an NFL attorney, 
who said the action would harm the integrity of professional football. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the game, called Sports Action, are to go to Oregon college and 
university intercollegiate sports programs, which now receive no state funding. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the game, players would wager $1 and try to predict the 
outcome of between four and 14 games against the point spreads set by Nevada 
odds makers. The more games they bet, the more money they could win. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precedent Feared 
</P>
<P>
NFL attorney Jim Noel told the commission that the game would create a 
situation in which fans are more interested in point spreads than they are in 
how their favorite teams fare. 
</P>
<P>
Noel also said the league is concerned that approval of such a game would set a 
dangerous precedent. 
</P>
<P>
"Oregon is on the brink of triggering a nationwide trend," he said. "The entire 
nation is watching." 
</P>
<P>
Noel said the NFL would consider legal action to block the contest. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come out here to threaten anyone," he said. But, he added: "There 
are some very viable legal issues here that we're going to evaluate." 
</P>
<P>
Commission members noted, however, that betting on professional sports already 
is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pick Up a Phone' 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do in Oregon is pick up a phone and place a bet," Oregon 
Lottery Director Jim Davey said. "People do it every day." 
</P>
<P>
Noel countered that the NFL does not want to see gambling on professional 
sports expand. 
</P>
<P>
"The net effect of the Oregon game will be to increase the overall volume of 
betting," the NFL attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Oregon Legislature approved a bill calling on the Lottery Commission 
to create a sports-oriented game to generate money for college sports. Davey 
and the lottery staff put together the specifics of the NFL contest.

STEALTH FLIES FOR FIRST TIME, HEATING UP CAPITOL DEBATE;

B-2 FACING NEW HURDLE, ASPIN SAYS

EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The $500-million B-2 stealth bomber flew for the first time today, soaring 
above the Southern California desert on a two-hour flight aimed at keeping 
Congress from scrapping history's most expensive warplane. 
</P>
<P>
The flight appeared flawless to observers who watched the sinister-looking 
flying wing take off from secrecy-shrouded Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale 
shortly after 6:30 a.m. and land later at nearby Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
But the maiden flight did not diminish the B-2's controversy on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a giant leap for Northrop but one small step for the B-2 program," 
warned House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Checkbook Hurdle' 
</P>
<P>
"The B-2 has still another hurdle to clear -- the checkbook hurdle," explained 
Aspin, who has told the Pentagon it will be impossible politically to spend as 
much as $8 billion a year in the early 1990s that the Administration wants for 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The four-engine bomber, built with composite materials and a shape not easily 
detectable by radar, circled over the Antelope Valley at three different speeds 
with two F-16 fighters giving chase through a clear sky. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2, a tailless, 172-foot-long wing with bulges in the middle, finally 
descended onto a runway and quickly rolled to a stop without a wobble, waited 
for several minutes and then taxied off into a hangar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Nimble Aircraft' 
</P>
<P>
"We were very pleased with the performance of the aircraft. It was very close 
to the simulators," said Bruce J. Hinds, chief test pilot for Northrop Corp.'s 
B-2 Division, who flew the plane with Air Force Col. Richard Couch. 
</P>
<P>
Couch called the B-2 a "very nimble aircraft" and said it made a "Grade A" 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to ask the tower if we were on the ground," Couch said. "If we appear a 
little giggly about all of this, it was a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
The flight was seen as vital for the future of the bomber, which is already 18 
months behind schedule. At a budgeted price of $500 million each -- the Air 
Force wants 132 of the planes -- it is the most expensive warplane in history. 
</P>
<P>
A key congressional committee voted to withhold further funding until the plane 
proved itself in the air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Far Too Expensive' 
</P>
<P>
"If that plane doesn't fly, the debate is over," Senate Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said Friday. "It is far too expensive to be 
a stealth taxi." 
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, officials released a statement by Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney hailing the success of the flight: 
</P>
<P>
"It is good to see that the test program appears to validate the judgments made 
previously by the Department of Defense and Congress to go forward with the 
B-2," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) cautioned: "One flight does not a blank 
check get. (The Pentagon) obviously thinks they can get a few votes by getting 
it airborne for a few minutes (before next week's House debate)." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder supports an amendment to the defense bill that would stop production 
of the B-2 after 13 planes until further tests and flights.
