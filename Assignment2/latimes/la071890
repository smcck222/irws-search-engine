SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: THESE UPDATED DELLAS WOULD GIVE PERRY MASON CASE OF THE 
SHAKY KNEES

<P>
For three summers, the Friends of the La Jolla Library have encouraged 
novelists manque to parody, ape or otherwise mimic a famous writer with San 
Diego connections. 
</P>
<P>
In the first two contests, the writers were Dashiell Hammett and Raymond 
Chandler. Now it's Erle Stanley Gardner, author of 82 Perry Mason novels and a 
resident of Temecula before his death in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
A goodly number of contest entrants have tried to clarify the psycho-sexual 
dynamic between Mason and secretary Della Street. Gone is the Gardner 
reticence. 
</P>
<P>
Several entrants even went revisionist, making Della more assertive and 
seductive. Definitely a Della for the 1990s, dominating Mason and making him 
love it. 
</P>
<P>
Like this from "The Case of Fresh Strawberries": 
</P>
<P>
 Deli Street, efficient, determined secretary of the successful, offbeat lawyer 
Peary Mason, pulled her skirt over her shapely, businesslike knees... 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly, Peary, I think this strawberry thing is ridiculous. Only a 
fruitcake would take a case like this." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from an untitled submission: 
</P>
<P>
 Della Street walked into the lawyer's office with a red rose clenched in her 
teeth. ... Paul Drake's mouth hung open as Della donned a veil and the 
(marriage) ceremony commenced. 
</P>
<P>
 And from "The Case of the Crocodile Tears": 
</P>
<P>
 Perry Mason's faithful secretary, long, lean and lanky Della Street, moving 
with double-jointed ease, ushered a swizzle-stick slender woman into Mason's 
leather-bound lawbook-lined private office. 
</P>
<P>
 And from "The Case of the Patient Secretary." 
</P>
<P>
 Della was pretty as a follies girl in a sheer pink dress that sent a glow to 
her face. ... "If the ring pleases you, will you wear it, Della, my love? 
(begged Mason)." 
</P>
<P>
 The winners (first prize, $200) will be announced tonight after a showing of 
the 1935 Perry Mason movie "The Case of the Lucky Leg," starring the mercifully 
forgotten Warren William. 
</P>
<P>
The contest entrants may find it a bit dull. Della doesn't have much of a role. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodging Taxes, Cameras, Bullets 
</P>
<P>
Covering the sunny city. 
</P>
<P>
* Tax my patience. 
</P>
<P>
Tax protester and perennial candidate Barbara Hutchinson has reconsidered: She 
will be a write-in candidate against Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
She hasn't run for office since doing time in federal prison on a tax beef. But 
the S&amp;L scandal and President Bush's "forget-my-lips" announcement have 
pushed her too far: 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to ride a white horse and wear a body-stocking and a blond wig to 
get attention, I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
* Great moments in San Diego journalism. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8, trying to ambush interview a fleeing Bill Kolender in the 
underground parking lot of the Union-Tribune building. 
</P>
<P>
A U-T security guard sticking his hand in front of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
* And that's the way it is: really polluted. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Cronkite is in town today to film a video on Mission Bay pollution for 
the San Diego Oceans Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
* Dan Fouts has denied the leaked-out reports that he was once wounded by a 
jealous husband. That hasn't stopped the media jokers. 
</P>
<P>
Shotgun offense, bullet passes, arm like a rifle, etc.

<P>
Ghost Library 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego City Council committee this afternoon debates whether to ask voters 
in November to approve a bond issue to build a new central library and expand 
17 branches. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago the tab was put at $109 million. Now it's $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, the city manager says an additional tax increase will be needed for 
operating expenses for the new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
All of this before a site has been picked for a new central library. 
</P>
<P>
Rising costs, an operating tax, site unseen? Is it likely that voters will give 
the needed two-thirds approval for a bond issue? 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to try," says bond booster Judy McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
Other library lovers prefer a slimmed-down bond issue, and only after a site is 
chosen. The discussion should fill pages.

LOOKING LIKE A MILLION BUCKS; 
</P>
<P>
LANDMARKS: GIANT DIPPER ALMOST READY TO ROLL AFTER NEARLY A DECADE OF EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Back on the Fourth of July, 1925, people flocked to Mission Beach for a chance 
to feel the sea air rip through their hair as they zoomed along the tracks of a 
new demon roller coaster, the Giant Dipper. 
</P>
<P>
On that inaugural day, a 16-year-old named Les Hamm got the ride of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 65 years later, the 81-year-old Hamm will do it again when the 
Giant Dipper is let loose for its grand reopening, following a $1.2-million 
restoration project by San Diego Seaside Co. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only roller coaster I've ever been on in my life. I'm not scared of 
it," said Hamm, a retired photographer who lives in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Under the blaze of the early-afternoon sun, construction workers are hurrying 
along the 2,600 feet of wood-and-steel track, pounding in the last nails and 
spreading on more than 1,000 gallons of pink, green and white paint, the new 
signature colors of the Giant Dipper in Belmont Park, which will reopen 
sometime during the first week of August. 
</P>
<P>
Coaster restorers have taken more than a few phone calls about the track being 
painted pink. But a little neighborhood disagreement on the color scheme 
doesn't have them bothered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different, it stands out," said Tim Cole, assistant manager of the 
Seaside Co., the group paying for the renovation work. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a lease dispute with the city, the Giant Dipper has been derailed 
since 1976 and faced the threat of demolition as recently as 1982. But a 
volunteer army of roller coaster buffs, calling themselves the Save the Coaster 
Committee, won a three-year lease on the land from the city and were given a 
chance to renovate the structure at Mission Boulevard and West Mission Bay 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The committee first got custody of the coaster in 1982 when it was donated by 
William Evans, who also owned the nearby Bahia Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
With the slowly deteriorating ride on its hands, the committee raised about 
$250,000 in donations and started to give the Giant Dipper -- considered by 
some more of a giant neighborhood eyesore -- its much-needed overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent lots of our weekend time with scrapers in one hand and paintbrushes 
in another," said Cole, who said he has been working to save the coaster for 
about nine years. 
</P>
<P>
But a passion for roller coasters and a desire to ward off the wrecking ball 
weren't enough to keep paying the bills, and the Save the Coaster Committee 
soon fell behind schedule. The city suggested it get some help. 
</P>
<P>
A Northern California-based roller coaster operator, the Santa Cruz Seaside 
Co., formed a joint venture with an amusement-equipment manufacturer to obtain 
a 31-year lease from the city to manage the coaster. After a 1987 inspection of 
the ride, the San Diego Seaside Co. was established, and the heavy-duty 
renovation work began. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Cruz Seaside Co. operates the Santa Cruz Giant Dipper, one of only two 
seaside coasters in the West -- San Diego's Giant Dipper is the other -- wood 
frame ancestors of today's twisted metal, high-tech, high-speed contraptions. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego coaster is in the final stages of restoration -- virtually a 
mirror image of the Dipper as it was in the '20s, but with some '90s features 
added. 
</P>
<P>
All of the track has been replaced, along with all 28,973 bolts and much of the 
Douglas fir framework. A new concrete foundation has been poured for better 
support. 
</P>
<P>
If not for damage caused while the bolts were being replaced, much more of the 
original wood could have been used, restorers say. About 90,000 of the 300,000 
board-feet in the framework have been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to replace all the bolts, so we had to take them all out," Cole said. 
"In banging out old bolts, we splintered the wood when we pounded them out. 
Wood doesn't age like people age." 
</P>
<P>
A new 24-seat train that complies with modern safety requirements will also be 
added. The six-car steel and fiberglass train will whip riders around a 
half-mile of track, take them down 13 drops and hit a top speed of 45 m.p.h. 
during what restorers promise will be a two-minute, hair-raising ride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that big, but it's compact. This ride has a lot of personality," said 
the 29-year-old Cole, who hasn't ridden the coaster since his 15th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
What the Giant Dipper might lack in speed and height -- the track is 71 feet up 
at its highest point -- it compensates for in history. During a ceremony last 
July 4, the coaster claimed its spot in history along with such landmarks as 
Mission San Diego de Alcala and the Hotel del Coronado when it was designated a 
national historic landmark by the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
When the coaster does open for business, organizers are hoping for a reciprocal 
relationship with Belmont Park, the retail shopping center next to the coaster 
that opened in September and is about 80% leased. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, officials on both sides are banking on it. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably wouldn't have done it if the shopping center hadn't been there. It 
was a real blighted area," said Ed Hutton, president of San Diego Seaside Co. 
</P>
<P>
Before the retail center was built, the site was mostly empty space with a few 
scattered remnants of the run-down Mission Beach Park. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont Park developers are striving for a balance of stores and restaurants in 
the shopping center to attract both tourists and locals, and the coaster may 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the coaster will be a natural draw. We're pretty closely oriented on 
the property, so we need to work together," said Skip White, executive vice 
president of Belmont Park Associates, developer of the retail center. 
</P>
<P>
A grand reopening celebration is being planned for Belmont Park this fall, once 
the coaster has been up and running for a while, White said. 
</P>
<P>
Work crews are pushing to finish the electrical wiring, put in the last stretch 
of track and get the 100-horsepower motor up and running so the Dipper can pull 
out of the station house in time to take its new generation of riders on a trip 
through history. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, the coaster will run from 11 a.m. until 11 p.m., at $2 a 
pop. For some, it will be more than an amusement park ride they're paying for. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to believe that they're riding this thing that doesn't look safe 
and that's got this sordid history," Cole said. "That way, they've accomplished 
something."

VENTURA JOINS OPPOSITION TO EDISON MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council has joined the cities of Simi Valley and Ojai in 
opposing the proposed merger of Southern California Edison with a San Diego 
utility. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy, late-night public hearing Monday, the council voted 4 to 3 to 
join the two cities with the worst pollution problems in the county in 
objecting to the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's consolidation with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, the council majority 
determined, will increase pollutants in Ventura County, which has the 
fourth-worst air pollution level in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't support a merger that will lead to further pollutants being dumped 
into our air, in exchange for a token reduction in utility bills," said Vice 
Mayor Donald Villeneuve, who introduced the resolution against the merger. "The 
mitigation measures proposed by Edison have yet to be proven to be reliable." 
</P>
<P>
However, neither the county nor its cities have veto power over the merger. 
That decision lies with the state Public Utilities Commission, which is 
expected to make a ruling before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, about a dozen residents and environmental leaders spoke 
against the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"If you feel that the cities' air should not be used as Edison's garbage dump . 
. . support your sister cities . . . in their opposition to any emission 
increases taking place in Ventura from the proposed merger," said Pat Baggerly, 
a leader of the Ventura-based Environmental Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Edison officials pleaded unsuccessfully with the council to support the merger, 
which company officials said would lead to a significant reduction in air 
pollution in the county over the next 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of an agreement reached last month by Edison and the County 
Board of Supervisors acting as the Air Pollution Control District, the utility 
would be allowed to emit hundreds of tons of additional pollutants over the 
next five years. In exchange, Edison would help the county achieve long-term 
reductions by paying companies to convert to cleaner sources of energy. 
</P>
<P>
That agreement would lead to reductions of more than 300 tons of pollutants in 
13 of the next 17 years. But in 1994, which is projected to be the worst year 
of air quality, the merger will result in an increase in emissions of more than 
400 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Edison officials also said the merger will result in lower electricity bills 
for Ventura County residents, but they haven't said by how much. 
</P>
<P>
However, a majority of the council members said they did not trust Edison's 
commitment or ability to reduce air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite what you're telling me here, I don't see your track record as being 
that good," Councilwoman Cathy Bean told utility officials. 
</P>
<P>
Voting against the council resolution were Councilman James Monahan, who 
supports the merger, Councilman Todd Collart and Mayor Richard L. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
Francis and Collart backed a compromise position of supporting the merger only 
if the utility takes further measures to mitigate at all times the effects on 
air quality resulting from the consolidation -- not just in 14 of the next 17 
years. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Edison spokesman Nador Mansour said he was not surprised by the 
council's decision. "The council expressed concern about pollution in their 
city, and we understand that, we share their concern." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "the council has neither the expertise nor the time to evaluate 
our mitigation package. The county and the APCD have done that and arrived at 
the responsible decision of supporting the merger and our mitigation measures."

WALKOUT MARS COUNCIL SESSION ON REDISTRICTING; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: FOUR MEMBERS OF THE DIVIDED COUNCIL WALK OUT OF A CLOSED MEETING, 
CITING A WARNING BY THE CITY ATTORNEY THAT THE SESSION SHOULD BE HELD IN 
PUBLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Widening a growing breach over redistricting, four San Diego City Council 
members walked out of a closed session in which the subject was discussed 
Tuesday, while their five colleagues waded into murky legal waters by calling 
for two special meetings next month. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's developments deepened the two council factions' divisions over the 
volatile redistricting question, prompting accusations of grandstanding and law 
violations as procedural maneuvering continued to dominate the increasingly 
bitter debate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the council majority's request for special Aug. 13 and 27 meetings 
to decide between two competing plans for new district boundaries dramatically 
raised the legal stakes in the controversy, which has careened between City 
Hall and federal courtrooms for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the action a "clear, conscious violation" of a U.S. magistrate's order 
directing the council not to proceed with the redistricting plan until next 
week, attorneys for the Chicano Federation of San Diego County said they intend 
to seek a contempt citation against the city today in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
"The council has ratcheted this thing up and created a confrontation with the 
court," said Michael Aguirre, who filed the group's 1988 lawsuit challenging 
the constitutionality of the city's electoral system. "They've ventured out on 
a very precarious limb." 
</P>
<P>
But the city attorneys who will have to defend the council majority's decision 
argued late Tuesday that the prospect of yet another court hearing simply 
underlines the fact that Magistrate Harry McCue's order is subject to differing 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two ways of looking at this, and the question of which is correct is 
something only a judge can answer," said Jack Katz, a senior chief deputy city 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
As with most of the critical chapters in the redistricting battle, both of 
Tuesday's developments blended political realities with legal constraints, 
causing the principals to weigh their desires against the sometimes blurry 
guidelines governing what is permissible. 
</P>
<P>
Sharply focusing that conflict, the request for the two special August meetings 
could help to clarify how severely McCue's order last week has curtailed the 
council's prerogative in redrawing its eight districts' lines. In that order, 
McCue barred the council from proceeding this week, as planned, toward formal 
adoption of a redistricting plan that has drawn strong criticism from Latino 
activists, some community leaders and several council members since its 
tentative approval by the council last week. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond postponing council action, McCue's order also warns that, unless the 
council reverses itself and approves an alternative redistricting map developed 
by a citizens' advisory board, further court review of the plan is a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
Preferring a strict interpretation of McCue's order, the Chicano Federation 
attorneys emphasize that the magistrate's ruling directed the council to "not 
proceed in any way regarding the redistricting" until July 23. 
</P>
<P>
"The council has done something the judge expressly told it not to do, and once 
again it's done it through secret decision-making late in the day," Aguirre 
said. "To me, it's a clear, deliberate violation. The judge said do nothing 
until the 23rd. By their action, they've disobeyed that order." 
</P>
<P>
However, city attorney Katz, outlining the city's possible defense, argued that 
any judicial decision on the propriety of the council's actions Tuesday will 
turn on a semantical interpretation of McCue's order. 
</P>
<P>
"The council still hasn't done anything in terms of approving a redistricting 
plan," Katz said. "The question is whether even calling for hearings is doing 
something in respect to redistricting." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's scheduling of the two special August hearings stemmed from a 
discussion that began Monday when several council members publicly broached the 
idea of holding several meetings on the redistricting plans, arguing that doing 
so would provide an opportunity for greater public input that seemed to be in 
keeping with the spirit of McCue's order. But, with Mayor O'Connor and others 
questioning whether action on any such hearings would violate the letter of 
McCue's order, the proposal was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the idea was revived in Tuesday's closed session, in which an 
earlier teleconference among attorneys in the case also was discussed. Although 
City Atty. John Witt said that the idea's legality was never specifically 
addressed, he and other city attorneys advised the council that, because the 
issue dealt with the council's schedule, it should be discussed publicly, not 
privately. 
</P>
<P>
It was that advice that prompted O'Connor and the three other council members 
-- Ron Roberts, Bruce Henderson and Judy McCarty -- who voted against the 
redistricting map conceptually approved last week -- to walk out of the 
closed-door hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the four pointed to the attorneys' admonition in defending their 
walkout, the five who remained behind -- and who supported last week's map -- 
denounced their colleagues' action as a public-relations stunt having less to 
do with legalities than with trying to embarrass the council's majority. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just more cheap political theatrics," said Councilman Wes Pratt. "The 
whole thing was contrived to make one side look good and the other side look 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, however, argued that the city attorneys' cautions seemed to militate 
against continuation of the private hearing, both because of concerns that it 
should be held in public and questions over whether it might violate McCue's 
order. 
</P>
<P>
"When the attorneys say, 'We're getting into areas we shouldn't,' I'm going to 
listen," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't a set-up deal at all," Roberts added. "It was like a fire alarm 
that four people heard and reacted to." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of its motive, the walkout reinforced the mutual suspicions and 
antagonism that have developed between the council's two factions since they 
began grappling with the thorny decennial task of redrawing district boundaries 
-- a matter that directly affects each member's political future. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the plan passed last week dilutes the Latino population of 
a Latino-majority 8th District from the advisory board's proposed 52.2% to at 
most 51%, and perhaps lower. The plan, offered by Councilman John Hartley, also 
would dramatically alter the configuration of a number of other districts and, 
by some estimates, would change council representation for up to 300,000 San 
Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
But the advisory board's proposed map also has been criticized as tilting 
toward pro-growth Republicans and establishing boundaries that exclude the new 
or planned homes of two council members from their respective districts. 
Moreover, while the panel's membership was ethnically diverse, its critics have 
charged that conservative activists dominated its proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand how an advisory board run by some political consultants and 
land-use lawyers has come to be seen as having almost God-like qualities," 
lamented Councilman Bob Filner, whose 8th District is a pivotal factor in the 
overall debate. 
</P>
<P>
"The other side's really been winning the public-relations battle," added 
Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, who also supported Hartley's proposal. 
Councilwoman Abbey Wolfsheimer provided the fifth vote for that plan last week. 
</P>
<P>
The redistricting debate has been complicated further by the city's settlement 
of the Chicano Federation's lawsuit, under which the city agreed to establish 
the redistricting advisory board and to provide minority groups a meaningful 
voice in the process of drawing the new boundaries. By rejecting the advisory 
board's plan last week in favor of Hartley's proposal, only hours after the 
latter was publicized, the council violated that agreement, the Latino group's 
attorneys contend -- an argument that resulted in McCue's intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Undeterred by the prospect of Aguirre's threatened contempt request, Filner 
said he does not believe that McCue or any judge will fault the council for 
scheduling additional public hearings on such a critical issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This schedule just allows for public input as requested in the court order," 
Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing, Aguirre half-facetiously referred to Filner's history as a Freedom 
Rider who was jailed for his participation in 1960s civil rights protests in 
the South in describing the possible consequences of Tuesday's council action. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like Bob will get a chance to be jailed twice for the Civil Rights 
Act -- once for what he did for it, and once for what he did against it," 
Aguirre said.

<P>
The exercises are planned at least three days a week until Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Thursday, the sessions will begin at 11 a.m. and continue throughout 
the day until 8:30 p.m. The times may change slightly due to operational needs 
or weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the annual exercise has prompted telephone calls from residents

<TEXT>
<P>
The county is on a picture hunt, seeking photographs of four former members of 
the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
If found, the missing photos will complete a "Supervisors Picture Project" that 
was started several years ago and now includes about 50 former and present 
members of the board -- all but four who have served since the county was 
founded in 1873. 
</P>
<P>
The missing supervisors are: 
</P>
<P>
* H.L. Atwood, who served four years starting Jan. 1, 1877. 
</P>
<P>
* Robert Ayers, who served four years starting Jan. 1, 1885. 
</P>
<P>
* Charles C. Perkins, who served four years starting Jan. 1, 1915. 
</P>
<P>
* Edward S. Pierce, who served four years starting Jan. 1, 1949. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to ask your board and members of the public to put out the word" 
that the pictures are needed to complete the collection, Susan Van Abel, the 
county's principal administrative analyst, told board members Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The pictures, which are truly amazing, along with a map of the county, will 
depict the historical perspective and hairstyles of the county," Van Abel said. 
</P>
<P>
With or without the missing photographs, the collection will go on display 
starting next month on the fourth floor of the Hall of Administration in the 
County Government Center in Ventura. JACK SEARLES

AUTHORITIES BREAK UP RIOT AT JOB TRAINING FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 30 law enforcement officers, clad in helmets and armed with batons, 
broke up what was termed "a small-scale riot" Monday night at the Job Corps 
Training Center dormitory in Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A team of San Diego police officers and county sheriff's deputies arrested 
seven people -- all participants in the federal training program -- after a 
struggle to bring a crowd of about 50 job trainees under control, said Sgt. 
Glenn Revell, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The riot, which left nine people hospitalized, apparently broke out because of 
the arrest of a Job Corps trainee after a disturbance on an Imperial Beach 
street earlier in the evening, said Sgt. John Maschka of the Sheriff 
Department's Imperial Beach substation. 
</P>
<P>
"A group of people from the Job Training Center were wandering the streets of 
Imperial Beach, causing trouble," Maschka said. "They were just being kind of 
rowdy and boisterous." 
</P>
<P>
After deputies warned the group twice to calm down, they arrested one trainee 
about 9:20 p.m., Revell said. He was identified as Charles Edward Thomas Jr., 
19. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had allegedly scuffled with the deputies, injuring one of them slightly, 
Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, the group went back to the (Job Corps) center to try to incite the 
others into taking some form of retaliation against the police," Maschka said. 
</P>
<P>
That started a riot at the Iris Avenue center, Maschka said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the San Diego Police Department, Sheriff's Department and the 
U.S. Border Patrol converged on the scene around 10:15 p.m., accompanied by a 
canine unit and a helicopter team, Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Upon arrival, the deputies heard screams and the sound of breaking glass 
coming from inside one dormitory," Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
They moved into the dormitory and found the trainees fighting among themselves, 
Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were fighting with each other," Revell said. "They were not fighting the 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
Officers brought the situation under control around 11 p.m., Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
The seven people arrested, all ages 18 to 25, were job trainees who lived at 
the center, Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 to 600 young people live and study at the center, a residential 
education facility directed by the U.S. Department of Labor, Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
No officers were injured while bringing the riot under control, Revell said.

ANSWER TO GOMPERS SCHOOL PROBLEMS EVADES BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego city schools trustees remain at a loss over how to move the troubled 
Gompers Secondary School toward stability. 
</P>
<P>
There was no clear consensus among the five board members Tuesday about how to 
respond to the final report from a district-appointed community-school 
committee that listed severe discipline problems, high teacher turnover, a 
collapsing integration program and haphazard curriculum improvements, despite a 
much-publicized renewal plan put into effect two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees Kay Davis and Jim Roache called for some action by schools Supt. Tom 
Payzant to institute consistent student discipline, which the report described 
as nearly out of control at times in the junior-high portion of the 
seventh-through-12th grade math-science-computer magnet school in Southeast San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"If true, there is no way to educate any child without having stability and 
law-abiding (procedures) on any school campus," Roache said. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Shirley Weber debated colleague Ann Armstrong over whether the 53% drop 
in the number of white students choosing to be bused voluntarily to Gompers for 
the magnet program represents a severe blow to the district's integration 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Although Armstrong called the statistics disappointing, Weber asserted that the 
school was never really integrated because the white students were largely 
segregated in magnet classes that most of the largely nonwhite neighborhood 
students did not share. The renewal plan was set up to address demands of 
neighborhood parents that their children be given equal access to the 
high-powered curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Weber also called for "less microscopic examination" of every problem at 
Gompers, saying that no school would shine if put under similar scrutiny. But 
Davis responded that, "whether under a microscope or not, we've lost the 
interest of a lot of (whites) and we've got to work now on anchoring down the 
decorum" of the junior high students. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Orfield, retired Superior Court judge who chaired the committee, asked 
trustees to take the criticisms seriously, but he also praised principal Marie 
Thornton, who has been severely attacked by some Gompers teachers and parents 
for a lack of leadership and vision. "It's time to affirm complete confidence 
in Mrs. Thornton," Orfield said, adding his belief that the media have 
exaggerated Thornton's role in Gompers' problems. 
</P>
<P>
But parent Tom Kaye, who chaired one of the subcommittees, said he probably 
would transfer his daughter from Gompers. "There is extreme frustration that 
things haven't stabilized . . . and it's hard for me to say that things have 
even bottomed out and are going to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Payzant promised a reply to the committee report in September.

CITY TO GIVE WATER TO SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Ventura, in a gesture of solidarity with a sister city in need, 
will allow Santa Barbara to receive the full share of a two-year emergency 
supply of water from the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura City Council voted 6 to 1 Monday to give up 600 acre-feet of the 
water it was to have received from the MWD in exchange for sharing the costs of 
building a temporary pipeline to bring the water north from Oxnard under the 
Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard is hooked to the MWD, which receives the lion's share of its water from 
the state water project in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
By giving Santa Barbara the full 2,400 acre-feet expected to begin flowing in 
from the pipeline in November, Ventura forfeited its right to its 600 acre-feet 
-- enough to supply 600 families for a year. 
</P>
<P>
The council's gesture came one month after Ventura water officials learned of 
underground water supplies that would take care of the city's immediate needs, 
and weeks after a brush fire took a big toll on Santa Barbara's already 
depleted water reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Before the council vote, Santa Barbara Mayor Sheila Lodge said that without the 
emergency water supply, the city would run out of water by 1992. Santa Barbara 
has been hit harder by the four-year drought than any other city in the state. 
Its residents have been forced to cut back water use by 45%. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura is also suffering from the drought. Its residents have been told to cut 
back water use by an average of 30%. Lodge thanked the city for its generosity.

ROADBLOCKS TO DAYTIME HOMELESS CENTER CRUMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian signed legislation Tuesday clearing the way for 
construction of the Neil Good Day Center for the Homeless on the fringes of 
downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed $695,000 facility, which has been enmeshed in red tape for more 
than three years, would be downtown's first place where the homeless can go 
during the day for showers, laundry and other services. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation opens the way for the state Department of Transportation to 
sign a lease with the city for $1 a month and administrative fees for a 
25,000-square-foot piece of property along Interstate 5 and 17th Street between 
K and L streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this will once and for all be the last obstacle to building this 
center," said Frank Landerville, project director for the Regional Task Force 
on the Homeless, the group that originated the project. "It seems clear to us 
that virtually everyone in the community is in support of this project." 
</P>
<P>
The city, which has signed the proposed lease, expects Caltrans to sign the 
lease within the next few weeks, said Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor. Landerville also said the homeless task force expects Caltrans to 
sign the agreement soon. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Caltrans officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The second step toward building the center is selecting a new contractor. The 
first contractor backed out after realizing that he had miscalculated and 
underbid himself by about $95,000, Landerville said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebidding process should not delay construction, officials said. New 
construction bids for the 5,000-square-foot building and 5,000-square-foot 
outdoor lounge are scheduled to be put out in August and a contract is expected 
to be signed by late October, said David Allsbrook, projects director for the 
Centre City Development Corp., the city's downtown redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is to begin by late fall and be complete by late April, Allsbrook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's legislation appeared to remove the final legal obstacle, declaring 
that the tract earmarked for the center is not "excess" Caltrans property and 
did not need to be advertised to potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
A nearby property owner, Weldon W. Griffin, president of Weldon Griffin Realty 
&amp; Mortgage Co. in La Mesa, had filed suit seeking to block the proposed 
lease between Caltrans and the city. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge refused to grant a temporary restraining order, and 
Tuesday's legislation reaffirms Caltrans' position that the property is not 
surplus, meaning that the state agency can use property for future road 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin declined comment. His attorney, Jon P. Chester, was not available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the center to accommodate up to 200 homeless people and provide 
bathrooms, showers, mail and message service, laundry, storage of personal 
belongings and public telephones. 
</P>
<P>
Center staff will assist the homeless with social service and public assistance 
programs, mental health and substance abuse counseling, job training, legal 
assistance and other services.

SUIT CLAIMS POLICE BIAS IN HIRING FOR DRUG PROBES; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR CONTENDS THAT THE SAN DIEGO POLICE 
NARCOTICS UNIT ALLOWS JUST THREE FIRMS TO DO UNDERCOVER DRUG INVESTIGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego police narcotics unit has a policy of allowing only three private 
investigative firms with close ties to the department to do undercover drug 
investigations, excluding other local agencies capable of doing the same work, 
according to a lawsuit on file in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin S. Hill, a retired Escondido officer, filed the lawsuit in February, 
after he was purportedly told by San Diego Police Lt. Dan Berglund that he and 
his firm, California Confidential Services, were unqualified to do an 
undercover investigation at Sony Corp. of America. 
</P>
<P>
Hill sued for $1.2 million in damages, naming as defendants Berglund, San Diego 
Police Chief Bob Burgreen, Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno, former Escondido 
Chief James W. Connole, the cities of San Diego and Escondido, and several 
other Escondido and San Diego officers. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was filed, the case has traveled slowly through the federal court 
system, with defendants filing motions asking to be dropped from the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, the officers and chiefs slandered Hill and engaged in 
a conspiracy to prevent him from being hired by Sony for an undercover 
investigation of some of the company's employees who were suspected of drug 
use. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Deputy City. Atty. James Chapin said Tuesday that U.S District Judge 
Earl Gilliam recently dropped the city of San Diego, Burgreen and Berglund as 
defendants in the lawsuit, when he ruled that the complaint was insufficient as 
it applied to the three. But Chapin said that Gilliam also allowed Hill's 
attorney to update the lawsuit in order to include them as defendants again. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hill's lawsuit once again raises an issue that has been vexing for San 
Diego police and the city for several years. Other investigative firms, some of 
them run by former police officers, have complained bitterly about Berglund's 
decision to work mainly with Narcorp, Kennedy Consulting &amp; Investigations 
and Kraut &amp; Snyder, a Los Angeles-area firm, in private, undercover drug 
investigations at local work sites. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, undercover drug investigations done by private investigators in San 
Diego have to be cleared with police. San Diego narcotics officers insist on 
supervising all drug transactions done in an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Until this week, Berglund led the police narcotics unit and supervised drug 
investigations. On Monday, he began working as a supervisor in the homicide 
unit. Berglund and Cmdr. Larry Gore referred all questions about the lawsuit to 
Chapin. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's lawsuit alleges that Berglund accused him of being "mentally unbalanced 
and a danger to the public" at an April 17, 1989, meeting. Berglund also 
allegedly told him that he was unauthorized to carry a concealed weapon, Hill 
said. The Sheriff's Department revoked Hill's concealed weapon permit June 5, 
1989, said the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after meeting with Hill, Berglund notified Sony that Hill's firm was 
unqualified to do the investigation and told the company that only Narcorp, 
Kennedy Consulting &amp; Investigations and Kraut &amp; Snyder were approved by 
San Diego police to do private, undercover drug investigations in the city, the 
lawsuit contended. 
</P>
<P>
A former police officer who runs a private investigative firm in San Diego 
echoed Hill's complaint. The investigator, who did not want to be identified, 
said he and employees of his firm had two meetings with Berglund to complain 
about his refusal to work with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"They favored Narcorp to a larger degree and were directing most of the 
business to Narcorp. . . . The Police Department was acting in a capacity they 
don't really belong in," said the investigator. "My feeling is that basically 
Berglund was out of his league. We get our license from the state of 
California, not the city of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Narcorp owner Hal Phenix, a retired San Diego narcotics officer, said he did 
not know Hill and denied that his company had received favorable treatment from 
Berglund and San Diego police. 
</P>
<P>
"Cops just don't do that. Police administrators are so concerned about 
appearances that they're very careful about what they do," Phenix said. "I 
don't get referrals from the department." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Macleod, new owner of Kennedy Consulting &amp; Investigations, also denied 
that his company gets referrals from San Diego police. 
</P>
<P>
Chapin, the deputy city attorney, said his office has been meeting with police 
officials to discuss the department's policy in working with private firms on 
undercover drug investigations. He added that city officials have also talked 
with the state about assuming responsibility for approving private 
investigative firms that work on undercover drug investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Private investigators are licensed by the state Department of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"On its face, I believe that the policy we have now is fair. These 
investigations involve the buying and selling of drugs, and this is uniquely a 
police function," said Chapin. "The Police Deparment is currently in the 
position of taking responsibility for supervising this function. State law 
requires the police to supervise anybody they approve for these 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
Chapin said narcotics officers have to be very selective about the private 
firms they approve for undercover drug investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"Investigations of this type would ultimately make the city liable if anything 
went wrong. . . . We have to be very careful about who we approve and are 
willing to supervise in these investigations," Chapin said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's problems extend beyond the San Diego and Escondido police departments. 
Although the Sheriff's Department is not listed as a defendant, court records 
show that sheriff's officials revoked Hill's permit to carry a concealed weapon 
after learning he omitted information about his employment with Escondido 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Snyder, manager of the sheriff's license division, said in a letter 
included in the court file that Hill applied for a concealed weapon permit on 
Nov. 25, 1986, without disclosing that he had formerly worked as an Escondido 
police officer. The permit was renewed in 1988 and briefly in 1989 before it 
was revoked in June, 1989.

MAKING A RUN AT SAVING RIDGELINES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: ED AYRES WILL COMPETE IN A 146-MILE FOOT RACE FROM DEATH VALLEY TO 
THE SUMMIT OF MT. WHITNEY TO RAISE MONEY FOR A PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Ed Ayres' perspective on development in the Santa Clarita Valley is from above. 
</P>
<P>
An ultra-marathoner, the 48-year-old Santa Clarita resident runs for several 
hours daily along the dusty network of ridges that cut the valley into dozens 
of smaller pockets. In recent years, Ayres said, he has watched as his favorite 
views of wide-open chaparral have been flattened and paved over to make way for 
new homes. Some of his favorite trails have been obliterated by new 
neighborhoods of tile-roofed tract homes. 
</P>
<P>
"When they decide to develop, they'll remove whole mountains," he said. "I was 
horrified to see this happening. It seemed to me a kind of killing, a kind of 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
Today he will compete in one of the world's most grueling foot races -- a 
146-mile race from Badwater, 282 feet below sea level in the scorching desert 
of Death Valley, to the freezing summit of Mt. Whitney, elevation 14,480 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Part of his reason for competing in the race sponsored by a running shoe 
manufacturer is to raise money to buy land for a "Wildflower Trail Park" in the 
Santa Clarita Valley, a linear park that would be protected from developers' 
bulldozers. Ayres said he has no particular site in mind, but he wants to 
protect as many of the smaller ridges that separate housing developments from 
one another as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The ridges act as natural barriers between the smaller canyons and valleys that 
make up the Santa Clarita Valley, creating a feeling of seclusion that Ayres 
said will be lost if open spaces are not preserved. 
</P>
<P>
The idea came to him when he says he does his clearest thinking -- while 
running. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning run along a ridge near Saugus High School about a mile from 
his house off Seco Canyon Road, the steady rhythm of Ayres' breathing was 
accompanied by the echoing thuds of a hammer, the distant whine of an electric 
saw and the faint rumblings of earthmoving equipment. An expanse of roofs, tidy 
lawns and curving streets spread out in the small valleys on either side of the 
ridge, covering the hillside to within 100 yards or so of where Ayres 
maneuvered his way among the dry brush. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of it, he said, has been built in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
From the ridge, which roughly follows the path of the Los Angeles Aqueduct 
pipeline, the ordered patchwork of streets and homes and yards stand in sharp 
contrast to a backdrop of rolling brown hills. The rocky trail follows the 
steep inclines and descents of the ridge, and brittle bushes whip Ayres' bare 
legs as he runs -- usually for several hours each morning. 
</P>
<P>
Ayres, who has run for 34 years and is editor of the Los Angeles-based magazine 
Running Times, said he has collected about 20 pledges ranging from 25 cents to 
a dollar per mile for his campaign to save the open spaces. He knows that with 
land prices soaring such puny amounts won't be enough for his ambitious 
project, but he hopes to attract the attention of others who will join the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just interested in seeing if I can help stimulate a few of my fellow 
citizens into doing something about this devastation at a community level in a 
community where it's not too late," the muscular, dark-haired runner said. "If 
there are not kindred souls that care about the hills and the environment, then 
those things are not going to last." 
</P>
<P>
The impact of development in the Santa Clarita Valley on schools and traffic 
has been debated tirelessly for years. Those issues concern Ayres, but he said 
he is not a joiner and finds it hard to imagine himself at endless meetings of 
planning boards and community groups. But he knows what he sees, and it is not 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something that happens when people are in close contact with nature 
that enables them to stay in touch with their most important values," he said, 
adding that exercising in such an environment increases mankind's ability to 
reason clearly and make wise decisions. "It's a kind of suicide to destroy the 
environment from which we evolved."

CLOSED MEETING HELD IN FATAL ACCIDENT

<P>
Attorneys for a 20-year-old Garden Grove man who is accused of killing a former 
schoolmate in a drunk-driving accident last month held an extraordinary 
closed-door conference Tuesday with the judge in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys who represent Justin Neff met privately with Ventura County 
Municipal Court Judge John Hunter to discuss the case, in which Neff is accused 
of causing the death of James Anderson, 18, a former fellow student at Fillmore 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter excluded Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes from the meeting at the 
request of defense attorneys Michael Norris and Richard Loy -- and despite 
objections from Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes argued that there is no California law allowing criminal defense 
attorneys to discuss a case with the judge while excluding the prosecutor. But 
Hunter refused to allow Holmes to join the meeting, and sealed the court 
reporter's transcript of it. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes moved to have the transcript unsealed, but Hunter denied the motion 
after the five-minute meeting with Neff's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Norris and Loy refused to tell reporters the nature of the meeting, and Holmes 
said he had no idea what they discussed with Judge Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Neff stood in the jury box, wearing prison garb and leg irons, 
waiting to answer charges of drunk driving and gross vehicular manslaughter 
while intoxicated. He appeared healthy, showing little evidence of the severe 
internal injuries he suffered in the June 15 accident. 
</P>
<P>
Neff is accused of driving his car while intoxicated into a power pole just 
south of Fillmore and killing Anderson, who had received his diploma just hours 
before from Fillmore High School. 
</P>
<P>
Neff's attorneys said they expect that he will plead not guilty to the charges 
at his arraignment, which Hunter continued until July 31. Hunter set a 
preliminary hearing for Aug. 27 after Norris and Loy said they need more time 
to study evidence including police reports, videotapes, photographs and 
statements from nearly 60 witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Neff remains in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail and faces up to 10 
years in prison if convicted. MACK REED

LAWRASON GETS FORM TO FILE FOR MAYOR

<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Paul Lawrason is the first elected official to request papers 
to run for mayor of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 6 election will be the first time Moorpark voters get to select their 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the mayor has been chosen for the post by the five-member 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Elected to the council in 1988, Lawrason served a six-month stint as mayor 
earlier this year. The city's current mayor, Bernardo Perez, has not indicated 
whether he will seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Although filing does not close until Aug. 10, Councilwoman Eloise Brown has 
indicated that she may run for reelection rather than seek the mayor's post, as 
had been rumored. Brown said she is keeping her options open, waiting to see if 
Councilman Clint Harper decides to run for mayor, as he has indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Harper has not filed for office or requested official papers to do so. Brown, a 
councilwoman since 1986, has requested documents to run for another four-year 
council term. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark Planning Commissioner John Wozniak also obtained papers to run for the 
City Council, said City Clerk Lillian Kellerman. Appointed in 1987, Wozniak's 
term ends this year. PSYCHE PASCUAL

LOW-INTEREST LOANS OFFERED FOR REPAIRS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although traffic congestion and the water shortage strictly limit new housing 
in Ojai, city officials say they have an ample supply of federal low-interest 
loans to make home repairs for low- and moderate-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
The city has accumulated $250,000 for a housing rehabilitation program that 
began this year. So far officials have begun processing seven loans for home 
repairs, averaging $15,000 each. But officials say they need other loan 
applicants to take advantage of the low-interest loan program before the 
federal grants expire. 
</P>
<P>
"We either use it or lose it," said Elaine Willman, assistant to the city 
manager. She said city officials are pleased with the new program because it 
helps them provide affordable housing required by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Taylor of the Area Housing Authority of Ventura County said the program 
has gotten off to a slow start. "It's like anything new, it requires a lot of 
advertisement," he said. The agency runs the program for Ojai under an 
agreement finalized in January. 
</P>
<P>
The program provided Ojai resident Betty Cundiff with a new roof for her home 
of 50 years, and she won't have to repay the no-interest loan until she sells 
the brick bungalow off Park Road. 
</P>
<P>
"I was desperate for a new roof," Cundiff said. "Everything was deteriorating. 
Now it's in pretty good shape. I think it will last another 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said most of the loans have interest rates of between 4% and 6%, which 
result in low monthly payments. Some elderly residents on fixed incomes are 
eligible for no-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
The loans can also be used to cover bank and escrow fees, termite inspection 
and eradication, weatherization, some landscaping, and for repairs to satisfy 
building and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible, an owner-occupant or renter must have an annual income of less 
than $25,000 for a one-person household, rising to a maximum of $44,650 for a 
household of eight or more. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage the homeowners to get their own contractors," Taylor said. "We 
just provide the technical assistance." THIA BELL

<P>
A Thousand Oaks school teacher who announced several weeks ago that she was 
seeking a City Council seat in the November election has unexpectedly withdrawn 
from the race. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Colleen Briner-Schmidt said she must postpone her plans 
because of "unexpected personal health reasons." 
</P>
<P>
She did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Briner-Schmidt, who was backed by former city Mayor Frances Prince, had billed 
herself as a slow-growth, environmental candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four people -- including Mayor Alex Fiore and Councilman Larry 
Horner -- have taken out papers to run for reelection in the fall, according to 
the city clerk's office. Thousand Oaks Planning Commissioner Judith Lazar and 
resident Michael Markey, a detective for the Compton Police Department, also 
said they plan to join the race for council. 
</P>
<P>
In the November election, three council seats are open, and candidates have 
until Aug. 15 to file their candidacies with the city clerk. Councilman Tony 
Lamb has announced that he will not seek reelection. TINA DAUNT

HOT WIRE BURNS 2 THEFT SUSPECTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Fernando Valley men were burned, one seriously, when they tried to 
steal copper wire from a live electric transformer in Santa Clarita on Tuesday, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve A. Lambardo, 25, of Sylmar and James A. Lorner, 24, of Northridge were 
injured about 4 p.m. when they attempted to remove copper wire from the 
Southern California Edison consumer substation on Bouquet Canyon Road, said Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Tim Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Lorner was in serious condition at Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital on Tuesday night 
as doctors searched for space at an area burn center, Peters said. Lambardo was 
treated at the hospital and released to police. 
</P>
<P>
The two men and a third person authorities said was involved, Shelia Panzer, 
24, of Northridge, were arrested on charges of attempted grand theft, felony 
vandalism and trespassing.

DOUBLE SHOOTING INVOLVING OFFICER REMAINS MYSTERY 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police had no new information Tuesday about what caused the shooting 
of an off-duty rookie officer and another man because both are still 
hospitalized and unable to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Officer David Mitchell, 36, was in serious but stable condition with wounds in 
the chest and both arms. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego man, Stanley Vance, 31, who also goes by the name Stanley Wheeler, 
is under guard at UCSD Medical Center in serious condition with a gunshot wound 
in the chest. Both lungs were pierced by the bullet. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler is being held on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, said a 
spokeswoman at the County Jail. Homicide Lt. Paul Ybarrondo said Vance also is 
wanted on an outstanding warrant. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at about 7:50 p.m. Monday in a parking lot at Euclid and 
Olvera avenues in Southeast San Diego, witnesses told police. According to the 
witnesses, Mitchell got out of his brown Dodge Colt and approached a green 
Chevy pickup parked nearby, said Ybarrondo. 
</P>
<P>
There was an exchange of shots and Mitchell staggered about 50 feet, then 
collapsed in front of the Imperial Fish Market while calling for help. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup started north, made a U-turn and then went south on Euclid Avenue 
before crashing into a concrete wall about six blocks away and going into a 
yard on Euclid Avenue and Norfolk Street in National City, Ybarrondo said. 
Officers discovered Vance in the pickup when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarrondo said Mitchell had a 9-millimeter, semiautomatic pistol with him. 
Mitchell, who graduated from the police academy in April, was recently assigned 
as a patrol officer downtown.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TARZANA TECHNICIAN ELECTROCUTED AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Tarzana electronics technician was electrocuted while working on a satellite 
transmitter at a Palms company. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Sheppard Grimm, 29, was pronounced dead on arrival at Brotman Medical 
Center in Culver City, said David Campbell, a supervising investigator with the 
Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics had been called to IDB Communications Group, 10525 Washington Blvd., 
at 6 a.m. Monday, Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Grimm, a radio frequency engineer employed by IDB for several years, "was 
accidentally killed when he came in contact with high voltage," said Jeffrey 
Sudikoff, IDB's chief executive officer. He said the equipment Grimm was 
working on operates on a minimum of 8,000 volts. 
</P>
<P>
IDB, a Los Angeles-based company, provides worldwide satellite transmission 
services for radio, television, cable TV and computer data, Sudikoff said.

CONTROVERSY OVER TAX FUNDS FOR ARTS AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times has once again demonstrated how out of touch it is with the values 
and morals of it readers, when it insists that their tax money be spent on the 
"performance art" of Karen Finley, John Fleck, etc. 
</P>
<P>
One of Fleck's acts, called "Blessed Are the Little Fishes," consists of 
urinating on stage onto a picture of Jesus Christ in a toilet bowl. The 
viewpoint that the NEA's existence is worthwhile only if it funds such material 
would be inane beyond belief, except that it came from The Times.

INFLATION WATCH: NIXON'S HOME TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A passing thought about former President Richard Nixon's little birthplace home 
next-door to the sleek new Nixon library in Yorba Linda: 
</P>
<P>
If Nixon's birthplace were on the market in Orange County today, a classified 
ad might read: "Restored 1BR bungalow w/loft; pantry/canning; bonus rm; large 
lot w/ citrus trees; fireplace; loads of country charm; yours for just 
$400,000." 
</P>
<P>
Talk about sticker shock: The house, thought to be a Sears prefabricated model, 
was built in Yorba Linda by Nixon's father for $800 in 1912, and cost about 
$400,000 to restore today. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, it could have been worse; imagine the rehab costs if it had been in 
Newport Beach! 
</P>
<P>
And it would be hard to find a house like it in the current housing market: If 
a young couple like Frank and Hannah Nixon were starting off in search of 900 
square feet of living space, they would have to shell out $160,000 to $180,000 
for a similarly sized condominium (yes, a condo, of course) in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
And it is likely that any other older house located on 1.1 acres of prime land 
would have been razed long ago for high-priced, custom housing. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, in an audiotape to be played in the home that will open this week as 
part of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace, waxes nostalgic about the 
angel food cakes his mother used to bake in the wood-burning stove. 
</P>
<P>
But if the aroma of home cooking is absent, gone too is an era when a young 
family of meager means could afford modest housing -- through Sears or 
otherwise.

TOO TOUGH FOR MERE MORTALS?; 
</P>
<P>
NEW SCHOOLS SUPERINTENDENT WILL NEED A BETTER-BEHAVED BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a paradox in the announcement that the talented William Anton is to 
become superintendent of the L.A. Unified School District. The paradox is that 
this might just be a job at which no good man or woman can succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Anton has risen from classroom teacher to become superintendent at a time when 
parents and other observers question if any educator can turn the beleaguered 
district around. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles public schools -- under-financed and overcrowded -- are 
micromanaged by an overly political school board that had lost confidence in 
Supt. Leonard Britton, who has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
If the job was tough when Britton took the helm three years ago, it is even 
tougher now. Anton inherits a budget pockmarked by massive cuts, a contentious 
board, a wary union and low staff morale. 
</P>
<P>
He has worked in the past with legislators and hopes to reassure Sacramento 
that every dollar sent to the district will be money well-spent. Part of that 
task will include addressing the widely held perception that the district is 
top-heavy with expensive administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Parents are losing confidence in the public schools. Many send their children 
elsewhere. That exodus is expected to increase as the district puts all schools 
on a year-round calendar -- despite the lack of promised air conditioning -- to 
make room for newcomers. Anton's instincts are pragmatic; he says delivering on 
that long overdue air conditioning is a top priority. But he also must think 
bigger. More than ever, this district needs a leader -- someone not afraid to 
step on some toes if he needs to. Anton already has demonstrated his ability to 
work with others. But sometimes he'll have to cajole, twist arms and anger some 
board members and other big shots in order to be a champion for the children of 
the nation's second largest school district. 
</P>
<P>
More than 610,000 students attend the district's schools. Nearly 61% are 
Latino; as many as one-third speak little or no English, but there is a 
shortage of bilingual teachers. Anton, a Latino, is expected to be sensitive to 
those challenges and to address ethnic rivalries among students. 
</P>
<P>
Because he has spent 38 years in the district, Anton has credibility with 
teachers, administrators and the board. He has reached out to the union chief, 
who is also new to that job. So Anton says the right things. He wants to make 
every school work. He wants every child to learn. That will require bold 
action. 
</P>
<P>
How much maneuvering room will the seven-member board leave him? Right now the 
board is full of praise, all but canonizing him. But what happens when the 
political honeymoon with Saint Anton ends, as all honeymoons do? Will it be 
back to micromanagement as usual? And therefore back to the paradox of the 
prescription for superintendent failure?

BOY WOUNDED IN GANG SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial on 2-year-old Brandon Lott was gut wrenching (July 7). 
</P>
<P>
Little Brandon's tragedy marks another ugly link in the life-cheapening chain 
that goes back farther than the Dred Scott U.S. Supreme Court decision which 
said that blacks were non-persons. 
</P>
<P>
Slavery was legal because blacks were considered "property" not people. 
</P>
<P>
The chain continued with Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood. 
Her Negro Project in the 1940s was tragically successful with its sterilization 
crusades and birth control clinics targeted for low-income black communities. 
Today, black babies constitute the largest number of victims of the monster we 
call abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Segregation in the 1960s, racial tensions in the 1970s and all-out gang warfare 
in the 1980s and 1990s show the progression of white oppression of black 
America. Brandon should be the poster boy for the devaluation of blacks life 
expressed so drastically in our society.

A 29-year-old Harbor City man was held without bail Tuesday on suspicion of 
killing a San Pedro contractor during a residential robbery, Los Angeles police 
said. Kevin McNeal Watson was arrested after the shooting death of Richard 
Mavar, 30, in his home Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred just after 11 p.m. when an intruder, armed with a 
high-powered rifle, surprised Mavar and his wife as they sat in their family 
room. Police said the intruder entered the house through doors left open 
because of the heat. Watson was picked up by officers shortly after the 
shooting as he jumped over a fence in the quiet residential neighborhood. The 
victim and his wife had moved into the new home only three months ago.

HAVE A COKE AND A SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among San Diego County high schools, the Coca-Cola symbol and athletics have 
been synonymous for years. Football scoreboards throughout the area feature the 
soft-drink logo in return for company support of school sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
Now Coke wants to be associated with academic achievement as well. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in September, Coca-Cola for Scholastic Achievement will become the 
newest program in San Diego city schools to strengthen and reward student 
efforts in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
School trustees Tuesday approved an agreement with the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. 
of San Diego to award two $500 scholarships each year to graduating seniors, as 
well as provide support for scholastic programs such as the Academic Decathlon, 
the Academic League, the Science Fair, teacher appreciation days, dropout 
prevention projects and the Math Field Day. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a good program for years stressing achievement in sports," said 
Tetsuo Pettiford, youth market representative for Coke in San Diego. "Now we 
want to have a program for youth academically as well." 
</P>
<P>
Coke and city schools will set up an executive board, with two members from the 
company and four from the San Diego Unified School District, to establish a 
process for recognizing students, teachers and community volunteers. The Gifted 
and Talented Department of city schools will coordinate district efforts. DAVID 
SMOLLAR

DAVID ANDREW TURNER JR.; BANK AUDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Andrew Turner Jr., who was an assistant vice president with First 
Interstate Bank, has died at his Sepulveda home. He was 42. 
</P>
<P>
Turner had worked for the bank since 1983 as an auditor in the data processing 
department in the bank's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
He died Sunday from complications of AIDS, said his companion, David Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
A native of St. Louis, Turner studied during his high school and college years 
at a seminary in St. Louis and earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University 
of Texas in 1978. He came to California, where he taught at Mt. St. Mary's 
College, Virgil Junior High School in Los Angeles and the Language Institute. 
He went to data processing school and worked for movie studios and Security 
Pacific Bank before being hired by First Interstate Bank. He also was a 
volunteer for the Chris Brownlie Hospice in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Turner is survived by his parents, Margaret Ester Schumacher and David Andrew 
Turner of St. Louis; a brother, William Anthony Turner of Houston; and a 
sister, Patricia Ann Gralick of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
A Mass is scheduled to be celebrated at noon today at Our Lady of Peace 
Catholic Church, 15444 Nordhoff St., Sepulveda. Donations in Turner's name may 
be sent to the Discalced Carmelite Nuns, 6301 Culebra and St. Joseph Way, San 
Antonio, 78238-4909.

JACK SMITH: THE PARAMETERS OF LANGUAGE ARE STATE OF THE ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In listing vogue words of the past few decades the other day, I seem to have 
left out more than I listed. 
</P>
<P>
Vogue words are not necessarily neologisms. They are more often words that have 
been in the dictionary for years, or in some limited use, such as "state of the 
art" and "parameter," but which suddenly emerge in common parlance and are 
inescapable, until, finally, they die of overuse. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that journalists are the culprits. One uses "state of the art" to 
describe some gadget, and it is soon applied to everything from lipstick to 
liposuction. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists are almost surely responsible for the transient popularity of 
viable, dichotomy, ambiance, communicate and relate, though they probably 
picked them up from the gurus of psychobabble. 
</P>
<P>
My colleague Gladwin Hill notes that metaphor, paradigm, construct, define, 
space and arguably are still in vogue. "Nothing exists just as is, on its own 
feet," he says. "Everything is a metaphor for something else." 
</P>
<P>
He wonders how we got along for 1,000 years without using paradigm, construct 
and arguably in our daily writings. Sportswriters write that Magic Johnson is 
arguably the best basketball player in the world. Why don't they just say it 
and let those argue who will? 
</P>
<P>
Hill also wonders why, in police parlance, a "perpetrator" is described as an 
"adult male," rather than simply as a man. Of course police parlance is rather 
rigid, perhaps for legal reasons, but such stilted usages inevitably seep into 
detective novels and the movies. I recently read a detective novel in which no 
one ever simply left a room or a car; he "exited" it. 
</P>
<P>
Fred A. Glienna of South Pasadena reminds me of the current popularity of 
"impact." He suspects, as I do, that the word has become inevitable because 
people can't remember the difference between effect and affect. "Impact solves 
the problem," he says, "while ultimately robbing itself of, well, impact." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Lundstrom of Arcadia says she has nearly lost her mind over the 
proliferation of ambiance and pragmatic. "They cause me to howl with pain, or 
grieve over our culture, or even stamp my feet in anger." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Brunell of Chatsworth complains about the overuse of legendary. True. 
Anyone who has got his name in the paper twice becomes legendary. 
</P>
<P>
W.P. Blair complains about the misuse of individual for person. Yes, we are 
always hearing that so and so is a good individual. 
</P>
<P>
Walter VanderVort of North Hollywood asks if I remember when viable was the 
vogue word. Of course I do. Those were the days when we had a viable lifestyle, 
viable relationships and viable alternatives. One might also have a viable 
dichotomy. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Goldberg notes the general misuse of literally. It is used to give force to 
something that is obviously not true: in other words, figurative. ("Kirk Gibson 
literally hit the ball a mile.") 
</P>
<P>
Garland C. Ladd disputes my contention that "at this point in time" is 
redundant and illiterate. He notes that the phrase "point in time" has a 
legitimate use in technical and scientific language. Good. Let it stay there. 
</P>
<P>
Wilfred H. Shaw of Hermosa Beach observes that "state of the art" does not mean 
the highest current point of development, as I suggested, but merely the norm. 
Rather than advertising that their product is "state of the art," he says, 
manufacturers should boast that it is "ahead of state of the art." He 
concludes, "But who could care less?" 
</P>
<P>
Brian King writes to protest the use of basically. "Am I basically out of my 
mind or has basically taken over our language? I am basically so tired of this 
word that I could basically upchuck a dictionary. If you basically don't 
believe me, just listen to lawyers, ballplayers, guys in bars and babes on 
buses. Basically anybody." 
</P>
<P>
(King might have said that he could literally upchuck a dictionary.) 
</P>
<P>
Barbara McCarthy of Capistrano Beach makes the same complaint. "All of a sudden 
sentences all are started with this ubiquitous word." 
</P>
<P>
Michele Mooney also vituperates against basically, complaining that it is the 
new crutch word used by anyone answering a simple question. "It is the modern 
hmm, the new errr, the B word which has replaced the hesitations of 
yesteryear." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marvin H. Leaf of Santa Monica sums it up: "At this point in time, it would 
seem that, hopefully, somebody who is into the English language could head up a 
committee to, you know, get us off of the path we're on and show us where we're 
at. But maybe it's not that important. I mean, most people could care less." 
</P>
<P>
William M. McNairn of Palos Verdes Estates asks if he may nominate me to 
President Bush for appointment as Secretary of Semantics -- "a new and vital 
cabinet post that could literally save the nation." 
</P>
<P>
I urge McNairn not to waste his time. Several readers have already written 
President Bush suggesting that he invite me and my wife to dinner at the White 
House. So far they have received nothing but extremely polite rejections from 
members of the President's staff. (I voted for Dukakis.) 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, if there is to be a Secretary of Semantics, I suggest William Safire or 
Tom Middleton, both of whom are much better qualified than I. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, I think the President couldn't care less.

Closed Book: Veteran Washington, D.C., newsman Jerry Oppenheimer is contacting 
people around town for his unauthorized biography of Ethel Kennedy, whose 
husband, Sen. Robert Kennedy, was assassinated in 1968. But it won't be easy: 
Kennedy is a private person, rarely talks to the press and has not answered his 
request for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Oppenheimer, who wrote "Barbara Walters: An Unauthorized Biography," said he 
signed a mid-six-figure advance with St. Martin's Press and will write the book 
even if Kennedy won't talk. 
</P>

Korean Model: Former Romanian gymnastics star Nadia Comaneci arrived Monday in 
Seoul, South Korea, to tour Olympic sites and to talk with fashion promoters 
about modeling in South Korea. Comaneci, the 1976 Olympic gold medalist in 
Montreal, fled Romania last December for the United States.

Ace in the Face: New York Mayor David Dinkins is wearing dark glasses around 
the office after being smacked in the eye with a tennis ball at a celebrity 
tournament Sunday. Dinkins, 63, saw a doctor Monday after Mayor Sharpe James of 
Newark, N.J., "hit a ball with some force . . . and I sort of got blinded." The 
ball sent Dinkins' glasses flying and knocked him to the ground. The injury 
left him highly sensitive to light.

Best Blonde: Bridgette LeAnn Wilson of Oregon topped 50 other teen-agers to 
earn the Miss Teen USA crown in the eighth annual pageant in Biloxi, Miss. "I 
went in and I was going to give it my best shot, and whatever my best was, I 
was going to hope for the best," said the blond, brown-eyed teen-ager after her 
win Monday. The 16-year-old said she hopes for a career in entertainment.

INTO THE NIGHT: QUINCY JONES FETE IS A STAR MAGNET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Party Monday night at the Roxbury restaurant and club thrown by Time 
Warner executives Steven Ross and Nick Nicholas to launch the Quincy Jones 
Entertainment Co., a joint venture of Jones and Time Warner Enterprises. It was 
part reception, part dinner, part hype. In the words of one bartender, "This 
isn't a soiree; this is a fete." 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: All the Time Warner brass, including but not limited to Ross, 
Nicholas, Bob Daly, Rob Friedman and Terry Semel. Among the 550 others were 
Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, Harrison Ford and Melissa Mathison, Clint 
Eastwood, Paula Abdul, Danny Glover, Mary and Irving Lazar (who explained the 
A-list crowd: "Big talent attracts big talent"), Mike Ovitz, George Schlatter, 
Tina Sinatra, Brooke Shields, Ashley Boone, Lou Gossett Jr., and Henry Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: What will Quincy's new company do with Time Warner? Whatever Quincy 
wants. Films, TV, plays, music -- the way the Time Warner execs talk, if Quincy 
wanted to open a Taco Bell with singing waiters, they would say, si. "He's one 
of the great geniuses of our time," Ross said. It was all young love in bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: Relatively business-like conservative. One fashion writer 
explained: "If this was New York, it would be what they wore to work. But this 
is L.A., so they went home and got dressed." 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Served buffet-style, there were two extensive menus that included grilled 
salmon, smoked ham, Southern fried chicken, short ribs, collard greens and 
seafood saffron rice. The food was bountiful; the trick was finding a place to 
sit. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "I circled the field a long time," Quincy Jones said. "It took 57 years 
to get here. Then the deal took 14 months to put together." 
</P>
<P>
Best Compliment: "When you have a body of work like Quincy has, you begin to 
appreciate it for all its facets," Harrison Ford said. "It's just the pure 
energy of goodness of soul." 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: The line for valet parking extended all the way up Sunset Boulevard 
to somewhere near the Nevada border. Retrieving cars was equally difficult. "I 
think they parked my car in the Central Valley," one guest said.

Mark and Brian and the Diceman: Andrew Dice Clay took to the airwaves Tuesday 
morning as a guest on KLOS 95.5 FM's Mark and Brian Show. 
</P>
<P>
The show's producer, Nicole Sandler, said that Clay took unscreened listener 
calls from 8 to 10 a.m. in his only local radio appearance. "It's the first 
time he's ever taken phone calls like that," said Sandler. "He really dropped 
the Diceman act and talked to people." She said he explained that what he does 
is only an act. "Some people were hostile at the beginning, but to my surprise, 
there wasn't one person who went away angry," said Sandler. Clay fielded 25 
calls. BETH KLEID

WILD, WOOLLY ACTION IN 'MADE IN HONG KONG'; 
</P>
<P>
FILM SERIES: AT A HYPERDRIVE TEMPO, THESE NEW-GENERATION FILMS GO BRUCE LEE ONE 
BETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Blazing with color, bursting with action, spilling all over with wild effects 
and go-for-broke pyrotechnics, the six Hong Kong action films that comprise the 
series "Made in Hong Kong" (Nuart), represent an ultimate triumph of style over 
substance, zap over content. 
</P>
<P>
This is generic movie-making at its wildest and woolliest, an exploding 
Oriental cornucopia. Somersaulting warriors fly by, Jacobean vendettas unravel 
with bloody swiftness. Purple smoke billows out of caverns, witches and wizards 
whirl in the skies. Zombies in haunted houses grope for the living, stunning 
maidens in red silks flee through wind-swept forests. Massed gangs of soldiers 
and gangsters sneer and blast away. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is in a kind of hyperdrive. In American action movies of the '50s, a 
thrill a minute was often promised. Here, a thrill every 10 seconds is more the 
norm; sometimes the intervals are whittled to two and three. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong movies first became famous because of Bruce Lee. These films, made a 
generation later -- by such Lee followers as martial arts director-stars Sammo 
Hung ("Eastern Condors") and Jackie Chan (not on this program), and brilliant 
directors like Tsui Hark ("Peking Opera Blues") and Ching Siu Tung ("Chinese 
Ghost Story") -- are more sophisticated and sometimes even more action-crammed 
than Lee's: the ultimate movie-movies. 
</P>
<P>
The interpenetration of Eastern and Western cultures is fascinating. American 
action-movie techniques are germinated by older Asian models -- the 
supernatural lore of China and Japan, Chinese music theater. And there's a 
tongue-in-cheek zest here that takes the sting off devices that seem abrasive 
in some of the American models. 
</P>
<P>
The directors are less a "school" than a tag team. Chan and Hung were Peking 
Opera acrobats together. Ching Siu Tung worked as action director for both Hark 
and writer-director John Woo ("A Better Tomorrow"). Hark produces and co-writes 
for both Tung and Woo -- and, from the look of "A Better Tomorrow 1," he may 
have partially directed for Woo too. 
</P>
<P>
"A Better Tomorrow 1 &amp; 2" (tonight through Friday) are the most 
conventional of the sextet. In these gangster revenge sagas, treacherous gang 
lords are hounded by a good and bad brother (crook and cop), aided by a third, 
swaggering ex-crook (Chow Yunn Fatt). The first film is zippy and racy, the 
second more labored, although the sexy Fatt, killed in the original, proved so 
popular he was brought back as an unlikely "twin brother." 
</P>
<P>
Sammo Hung's "Eastern Condors" (Monday and Tuesday) is an even zestier 
variation on American forms: a mixture of mercenary "Dirty Dozen"-style 
adventure, with stalwart heroes battling vicious Commies, and the typical 
one-against-a-bunch martial arts pyrotechnics of Bruce Lee, whose spin-kicking 
charisma Hung almost matches. There's a surprising villain here: Haing Ngor, 
the Oscar-winning refugee of "The Killing Fields." 
</P>
<P>
It's in the supernatural sagas, Tung's "Chinese Ghost Story" (Saturday and 
Sunday) and Hark's "Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain" (Monday and Tuesday) 
that the Hong Kong flavor roars out most spectacularly. These are spook sagas 
from the post-Spielberg, post-video, post-electronic age. 
</P>
<P>
Tung's "Ghost Story" plays like a cross between Mizoguchi's spectral romance 
"Ugetsu" and Sam Raimi's splashy gore fest "Evil Dead." Grotesque violence and 
macabre monstrosities, such as a mile-long killer tongue, contrast with the 
perfume-ad imagery of the love scenes: a ridiculous/glorious juxtaposition. The 
even more amazing "Zu," made by Tsui Hark, is the wildest of them all: a 
cascade of demons, warriors, "virgin boys" and witches done at a raucous clip, 
highlighted by such grisly touches as the freezing of the ice princesses and a 
fierce old man whose weapons include his own eyebrows and sideburns. 
</P>
<P>
If there's a masterpiece here, it's Hark (and Tung's) subsequent effort, 
"Peking Opera Blues" (Saturday and Sunday), which was shown at the 1988 
AFI/FEST and has since picked up a gaggle of East Coast cultists. Hark's 
violent editing style -- he rarely holds a shot longer than two or three 
seconds -- combines with florid, sumptuous period images: mansions, theaters 
and misty back alleys. 
</P>
<P>
The Byzantine plot involves three plucky girl-chums -- a revolutionary, an 
actress and a flirty worker -- racing nonstop through all the shifting 
intrigues of the 1913 warlord period. If you have any taste for action and 
romance in their more excessive forms, "Peking Opera Blues" is a real treat: 
rich, rare, entrancingly eccentric. So are most of these happily commercial 
movie-movies "Made in Hong Kong."

'COPS' A BLEND OF DRAMA AND REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ex-cop faces the camera, recalling the time he was shot in the chest 
point-blank by a fleeing bank robber and later operated on without anesthetic. 
But even 11 years later, the memory is still overpowering, and his voice breaks 
into deep sobs. 
</P>
<P>
This jolting footage of an anguished Jim Snidersich is the emotional 
centerpiece -- and by far the most compelling aspect -- of "Top Cops," a 
derivative CBS summer series premiering at 10 tonight on channels 2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
A production from Sonny Grosso and Larry Jacobson, "Top Cops" is a close cousin 
of a recent short-lived syndicated series in which Grosso -- a former New York 
policeman who helped break the famed French Connection case -- interviewed cops 
about their most memorable moments in the line of duty. Grosso does not appear 
this time. As in the earlier series, however, recollections from the officers 
are blended with dramatic re-creations featuring actors, in an attempt to show 
the perils and pressures faced by cops. 
</P>
<P>
The Snidersich segment is indeed harrowing, and his survival -- which is never 
fully explained -- seems miraculous. His own narration applies a dramatic 
exclamation point to the simulated sequences. 
</P>
<P>
It's the preceding two segments -- one about the dismantling of a bomb and the 
other about a Secret Service agent's dangerous undercover work -- that have a 
"Dragnet" just-the-facts quality and fail to capture the apparent suspense of 
the actual incidents. 
</P>
<P>
In that some of the re-created scenes focus entirely on criminals, moreover, 
there's no telling how much of this "reality-based" series is reality and how 
much has been made up to enhance the narrative. Whatever, too much of "Top 
Cops" just doesn't work. HOWARD ROSENBERG

A MELANCHOLY SLIDE INTO MEMORY FROM DENNIS POTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An aging husband and wife enter a suite in a frayed seaside resort hotel. They 
are hoping to bring back the romantic past, specifically their daring 
premarital fling in this very same suite nearly half a century earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Potter's "Cream in Your Coffee" is drenched in melancholy that is 
genuine, poignant and ironic. The 90-minute British feature, an L.A.-area 
broadcast premiere, lights up the "Dennis Potter Showcase" tonight at 10 on 
KCET Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
Dame Peggy Ashcroft and Lional Jeffries, the brittle old couple whose love has 
soured, are achingly authentic as relics of a sort beating their boats against 
the tide. What catapults the story is its split focus between the past and the 
present. 
</P>
<P>
The script continually segues to the couple as innocent young lovers (Shelagh 
McLeod and Peter Chelsom) enjoying a tryst at the hotel in 1934. Despite the 
golden haze of their frolic and their undying love, you see the emotional 
creases in these people that inform the acrimony at the end of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel -- a perfect Potter touch -- is also a major player in "Cream in Your 
Coffee" (a hit period song providing lyrical irony). The contrast between the 
lush, glamorous 1930s hotel by the seashore and its raggedy descent into an 
echoing resort for the geriatric set is a wicked metaphor for the whole story. 
There's also a devilish portrayal by Martin Shaw of a cad who's one sweet 
crooner. 
</P>
<P>
The production's last scene, on a punk rock/ballroom floor with Jeffries' 
balding husband deliriously caught in a time warp, is a leave-you-limp knockout 
punch, dynamically staged by director Gavin Millar. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, "Pennies From Heaven"-Potter catches the glaze of memory as it takes 
over your life. "That's the trouble," the husband laments at one point. 
"Everything is as if it was yesterday." RAY LOYND

A FLAWED 'PERFECT BABY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Perfect Baby," an ABC News special that looks at the genetic revolution in 
medicine, raises an amazing number of ethical issues in its hour of air time. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, "Perfect Baby," airing at 10 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42, is not quite perfect, offering only a quick skim over the surface of these 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the blame must go to the format that commercial TV documentaries are 
locked into: four neat little segments that leave room to sell ads. But a major 
part of the blame must go to host Barbara Walters (as well as executive 
producer Phyllis McGrady, for not reining Walters in), since this show has her 
indelible stamp: the trivializing of subjects, the short shrift given to 
serious answers, the sound-bite-sized bits and pieces tailor-made for promo 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
The issues eventually get the better of the host. The heart-breaking human 
dramas of "Perfect Baby" are compelling. Parents continually say, "All we want 
is a healthy baby"; in the show we see parents forced to make agonizing choices 
of life and death before birth as well as after, parents forced to confront and 
resolve as best they can real-life dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
The ethical questions raised by genetic engineering are many. A small sample: 
Who will manipulate childrens' genes? Who will decide what makes a "perfect" 
baby? 
</P>
<P>
The answers are complex, impossible even to state without injecting countless 
qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
Though good intentions do not necessarily a good documentary make, "Perfect 
Baby" is worth a look -- for the importance of its topic and its implications 
for all of us.MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNEY JUVENILE HALL RECERTIFIED BY STATE

<P>
Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey has been recertified. Barry Nidorf, chief 
probation officer of Los Angeles County, told the Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday that the California Youth Authority restored Los Padrinos' certificate 
Monday night after deciding that the crowded facility is providing proper 
sleeping conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Los Padrinos was decertified because youths were sleeping on four-inch 
mattresses that didn't meet state standards. The 700-bed facility was turned 
into a virtual factory last Thursday as workers stitched and stuffed 12-inch 
mattresses.

Two men who were rescued from the ocean after clinging to an ice chest for 18

Echeverria and Hernandez were rescued about 2 p.m. Monday by Los Angeles County 
lifeguards after clinging to an ice chest since 8 p.m. Sunday -- a total of 18 
hours in 65-degree water. Echeverria, Hernandez and two others left Marina del 
Rey in a yellow, 14-foot motorboat about 11 a.m. Sunday for a fishing 
expedition off Malibu. But about 8 p.m., the boat struck a submerged object, 
and the men were tossed into the sea.

A 29-year-old Harbor City man was held without bail Tuesday on suspicion of 
killing a San Pedro contractor during a residential robbery, Los Angeles police 
said.

<P>
Kevin McNeal Watson was arrested after the shooting death of Richard Mavar, 30,

The shooting occurred just after 11 p.m. when an intruder, armed with a 
high-powered rifle, surprised Mavar and his wife as they sat in their family 
room. Police said the intruder entered the house through doors left open 
because of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Watson was picked up by officers shortly after the shooting as he jumped over a 
fence in the quiet residential neighborhood. The victim and his wife had moved

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL VOTES TO FILE LAWSUIT AGAINST 
BROOKINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday voted to file a lawsuit to recover 
$48,250 in government rent subsidies that Bishop H. H. Brookins improperly 
collected from the city. 
</P>
<P>
The money paid to Brookins is owed because the bishop concealed his ownership 
in a Southwest Los Angeles building to receive $339,000 in federal loans to 
renovate the building, a city investigation found. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 9 to 4 to authorize the city attorney's office to file suit. 
Speaking for the majority, Councilman Marvin Braude said the city was obligated 
to collect on its contract with Brookins. Councilman Nate Holden, one of the 
opponents, argued that Brookins, a longtime leader of the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church, was being singled out in "a witch hunt."

IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY FIGHT, AND BOOKSHOP WON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the devoted book lovers who browse its endless, dusty shelves in search of 
the obscure and out-of-print, Acres of Books in downtown Long Beach has long 
been a beloved landmark. Now it is about to become an official one. 
</P>
<P>
Despite misgivings on the part of the city's planning and redevelopment staff, 
the Long Beach City Council on Tuesday unanimously voted to designate as a 
local cultural heritage landmark the 1920s, Streamline Moderne building that 
houses Acres, one of the largest used bookstores on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark designation gives an extra -- though hardly indestructible -- 
layer of protection to the sprawling bookstore that sits in the middle of a 
run-down block ripe for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to save us forever," conceded Jackie Smith, who helps manage 
the family-owned business, home to an estimated 750,000 volumes that lure book 
buyers from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It just added another layer of bureaucracy for developers to go through and 
buys us time. We're very grateful for that," said Smith, who was going to pick 
up a bottle of champagne on her way back to the Long Beach Boulevard store. 
</P>
<P>
The bookshop was nominated months ago for landmark designation, which can be 
used to delay demolition of a building for as long as a year but cannot 
ultimately stop it. The nomination was stalled when local planning and 
redevelopment officials fretted that the landmark ordinance should not be used 
to save a business in an architecturally mediocre building. Even Smith, who is 
married to a grandson of shop founder Bertram Smith, once described the former 
food market and dance hall as "not all that wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Ruthann Lehrer, the city's neighborhood and historic preservation officer, 
nonetheless prevailed, arguing that the 13,000-square-foot bookstore not only 
provides a worthwhile example of an architectural style but also serves as a 
unique cultural asset. 
</P>
<P>
No development project is currently proposed for the Acres block. Lehrer said 
that if one emerges, the redevelopment staff has agreed to either try to 
incorporate the 1924 Acres building into the project or find a new home for the 
shop, which has been at its present location for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Dark, huge and deliberately unchic, Acres has a style of its own that breeds 
strong loyalty among bibliophiles who journey through its dim recesses like 
pilgrims in Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
"Please save Acres of Books. It is a holy shrine for book lovers nationwide," 
Cal State Long Beach Prof. Ben Cunningham said in a telegram he sent to City 
Hall just before the council vote. 
</P>
<P>
The shop holds 500 categories of books, stacked in towering homemade 
bookshelves and old fruit cartons. Readers who walk the torn linoleum floors 
can find the "Tragedies of Shakespeare" cheek by jowl with "Freeze With Ease," 
along with books on subjects as diverse as UFOs and horses.

TEEN-AGER SAYS HE WAS BRUTALIZED BY POLICE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: LAWYERS FOR YOUTH FILE LEGAL CLAIMS AGAINST CITY AND COUNTY. 
THEY ALSO DEMAND AN INVESTIGATION OF JUVENILE HALL MEDICAL PRACTICES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for a teen-ager who says he was brutalized by police last month then 
denied adequate treatment for nearly two days while being held at Central 
Juvenile Hall demanded Tuesday that county supervisors launch a full-scale 
investigation into medical conditions at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, lawyers for Richard Gomez, 15, of El Sereno, filed legal claims 
against the city and the county, contending that the youth's injuries were so 
severe and had been neglected so long that he nearly died and had to undergo 
emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Such claims, usually rejected by the governmental bodies involved, are required 
before lawsuits can be filed. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the youth, flanked by his lawyers and his father, Manuel, told of 
being kicked repeatedly in the stomach by one officer, then punched in the 
stomach by another after he was arrested June 28 on suspicion of possessing a 
25-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
An Internal Affairs Division investigation into the brutality charges against 
the officers was launched two weeks ago, after a nurse who treated Gomez at 
Juvenile Hall filed a complaint, Cmdr. William Booth, a police spokesman, 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
But Jorge Gonzalez, one of two lawyers representing Gomez, told a press 
conference Tuesday that the case may indicate a problem wider than police 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last several weeks, county juvenile facilities have been found lacking 
in their custodial practices," Gonzalez said. "That lax attitude may have 
spilled over to medical personnel." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was referring to a recent spate of escapes from Central Juvenile Hall 
in East Los Angeles that have led to charges of lax security at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
He also was referring, the lawyer said, to the California Youth Authority's 
unprecedented decertification last week of Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey 
because of health and safety violations. Los Padrinos was recertified Monday by 
CYA officials after improvements were confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Both juvenile facilities are run by the county and are under the jurisdiction 
of the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Solis, superintendent of Central Juvenile Hall, said he could not comment 
on the Gomez case beyond confirming the dates the youth was at the facility and 
when he was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez characterized the treatment Gomez received at the juvenile facility as 
"negligent and callous." Even though the youth complained repeatedly of 
abdominal pains and asked for a doctor after arriving June 29, he was ignored 
and spent the night on the reception room floor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Gomez saw a nurse and a doctor the next day, the lawyer said, the pain was 
dismissed as being due to bruised ribs. Hours later, however, Gomez was found 
unconscious and rushed to County-USC Medical Center, where he underwent surgery 
for severe internal bleeding and a damaged liver and was hospitalized for nine 
days, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
A medical center spokeswoman, citing privacy laws, said no details of the case 
could be made public. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's press conference, Gomez pulled up his shirt and showed reporters a 
taped, nine-inch surgical scar down the middle of his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
The night he was arrested, Gomez said, he was walking with a girl near his home 
at Monterey Road and Armour Avenue in El Sereno when an unmarked police car 
screeched to the curb and officers ordered him to freeze and put his hands on 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
After he complied, the Eagle Rock High School student said, a male officer 
approached him from behind and, without provocation, kicked him in the side. 
The officer continued to push and kick him and at one point he passed out, 
Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after he was handcuffed and placed in a police car, a woman officer 
punched him in the stomach when he complained that he was hurt, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Bustamante, 29, said she watched the incident from across the street and 
was shocked at the behavior of the officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if he had a gun, I didn't see him do anything to cause them to treat him 
like that," she said.

CITING TROUBLES, SUPERVISORS SPLIT CORONER'S POST IN TWO; 
</P>
<P>
SHAKE-UP: THE BOARD DECIDES THAT BOTH A PROFESSIONAL MANAGER AND A 
PHYSICIAN-PATHOLOGIST ARE NEEDED TO GET THE JOB DONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's job is too tough for one person, according to 
the Board of Supervisors, which voted Tuesday to split the tasks of running the 
troubled office between a professional manager and a pathologist. 
</P>
<P>
The shake-up was prompted by an audit that sharply criticized the management of 
the office under former Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner Ronald Kornblum, who 
resigned from the post in April. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors on Tuesday approved a nationwide search for a lay manager to 
administer the coroner's office and a chief medical examiner-coroner to oversee 
autopsies and other investigations into causes of death. The chief medical 
examiner, by law, must be a physician. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, given the extent and nature of the demands made upon the office, 
the chief medical examiner-coroner must have very high levels of both medical 
and management abilities," said Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief 
administrative officer, who recommended the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"This combination is rarely found in one person. When it is found, it is likely 
that either the medical or the management responsibilities will not receive the 
full attention which they require." 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring was opposed by the Los Angeles County Medical Assn., the Los 
Angeles Society of Pathologists and the chief of Los Angeles County's forensic 
medical division, as well as two national organizations representing medical 
examiners and pathologists across the country. 
</P>
<P>
During a public hearing last week, Dr. Brian D. Blackbourne, San Diego County's 
medical examiner, told supervisors that placing a lay manager in charge of the 
coroner's office "will not make the situation better, but instead will make it 
much worse." 
</P>
<P>
Blackbourne, representing the National Assn. of Medical Examiners and the 
American Academy of Forensic Sciences, said the supervisors should leave a 
pathologist in charge of the department and "commit the needed resources and 
personnel so the job can be done as it needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said the lay manager, who would be called director of the Department of 
Coroner, and the chief medical examiner-coroner would be equals, and each would 
report directly to the Board of Supervisors. Dixon said his recommendation is 
designed to allow the chief medical examiner to devote his time exclusively to 
the medical duties "and not be diverted by day-to-day housekeeping of the 
department." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman, who opposed the change, said it would create "conflict 
and chaos" in the department. 
</P>
<P>
He said it will be difficult to fix blame for problems. "Whom do we hold 
responsible?" Edelman said. "The medical examiner is going to point to the 
administrator, and the administrator is going to point to the medical examiner 
when there is a problem." 
</P>
<P>
R. Dennis Persons, president of the Los Angeles County Funeral Directors Assn., 
supported the restructuring. He pointed out that 53 of the 58 county coroner 
offices in California are headed by administrators, often sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
As Los Angeles County coroner, Kornblum made no secret of the fact that he was 
a pathologist first -- for which associates around the county gave him high 
marks -- and an administrator only because he was forced to be one. 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum directed a staff of 160 people who, in 1989, investigated 18,000 
suspicious or violent deaths. More than 5,000 of those required autopsies by 
the office's physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Kornblum took over the office in 1982 when Dr. Thomas T. Noguchi, self-styled 
"coroner to the stars," was accused of poor management and lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
A management audit last April concluded that the growing number of homicides in 
the county is overwhelming the coroner's office, leading to a breakdown in 
controls, sanitary standards and protection of personal property. The 319-page 
report made 155 recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office was once headed by a non-physician. In 1956, voters 
approved a County Charter amendment separating the coroner from the public 
administrator's office and requiring the coroner to be a pathologist.

<P>
The situation of the United States in the world a year after the termination of 
a major global conflict is rather like that of 1920 (but unlike that of 1946) 
in one sense: We are many years away from the emergence of a new hostile 
constellation of power. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's concession of a 
united Germany's membership in NATO is the latest evidence of this. And unlike 
the situation of both 1920 and 1946, the international system may not, for a 
very long time, take a structural "shape" that could be construed as directly 
threatening to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
True, the impending international system will be characterized by disturbances, 
mostly non-strategic ones such as resource denials, restrictions of trade, 
environmental damage, population pressures, excessive migration, narcotics and 
fanatic terrorism. Indeed, such events are often substituted by participants in 
the new defense debate for the more definable challenges once posed by Soviet 
military power. But these specific disorders -- even narcotics and terrorism -- 
are, on the scale of grand strategy, nuisances, not even susceptible to 
national military measures. In short, this will be a nasty though not terminal 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Over the half-century of Cold War, we have been faced with putative 
requirements pressing upward against what fiscal constraints would allow. Now, 
fiscal constraints continue to press down, with federal budgets that would be 
running $200 billion a year in deficit (when all items are counted), unless 
they were brought down by heroic cost-cutting, driven by the specter of 
Gramm-Rudman, or shaved by grudging "revenue enhancement." But the external 
strategic requirements have fallen anyway. 
</P>
<P>
And now we have the peculiar problem of sizing our military forces in an era of 
challenges not susceptible to military solutions and violence not necessarily 
directed against us. But the irrelevance of explicit defense planning does not 
mean that our national security program should be randomly cut or crassly 
bureaucratically shaped. There should be some points of reference and some 
criteria of appropriateness. 
</P>
<P>
For essential clues for long-range defense planning, we must look to the 
structure of the international system and the evolving power configuration in 
the world. This configuration is shifting beyond the relatively manageable 
balance of power envisaged by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger 20 years ago, 
and toward a fragmented system that I call "general unalignment," consisting of 
a dozen-and-a-half regional contenders. In this fragmented world, where no 
great powers can make a profit -- or keep it -- outside their own regions, most 
conflicts need not directly threaten, or even indirectly implicate, the United 
States unless we set long fuses to other regions by contracting military 
alliances with governments and factions. 
</P>
<P>
Some general principles are also in order. The first is that the core values of 
our society -- the lives and domestic property of our citizens, the integrity 
of our territory and the autonomy of our political processes -- must be 
preserved against challenges, however unlikely, by organized forces in the 
world. This requires strategic deterrence in the form of offensive nuclear 
forces -- though not necessarily the traditional ones. These weapons would be 
reserved for a second strike at military targets. Also, the types of nuclear 
forces should be such as to maximize "crisis stability" -- that is, to 
discourage escalation in any lesser confrontation to the first use of nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
A second general principle is that the forces we keep, particularly our 
general-purpose forces, be "second-chance" forces -- that is, diverse cadres 
that could be rebuilt in case some threat materialized that was massive, 
cumulative, directed against us and potentially irreversible if we did nothing 
to eliminate it. This principle argues against tailoring our forces too 
radically or specifically for the illusion of functionally or regionally 
precise missions. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of defense program would these principles create "on the ground?" 
Though methodological precision is illusory, a certain degree of quantification 
is still in order, if only to pin down what we mean. The starting point, the 
Bush Administration's present 1991 defense program, calls for $295 billion in 
budgetary authority; 2 million military personnel; an active general-purpose 
force structure that includes 19 land divisions (16 Army and three Marine), 25 
Air Force tactical (fighter attack) air wings, and 14 Navy carrier battle 
groups with 13 air wings, plus the standard triad of strategic nuclear forces. 
If projected out five years, this would produce cumulative defense costs of 
$1.719 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
A conservative projection of where the executive and legislative branches will 
move the defense program in five years is: $253 billion (in 1991 dollars); 1.7 
million military personnel and a force structure of 16 1/3 land divisions (14 
Army and 2 1/3 Marine), 18 to 20 Air Force tactical air wings, and 11 or 12 
aircraft carriers with 10 or 11 Navy air wings. We would still have the nuclear 
triad, though under strategic arms reduction limits. This would come to a 
five-year defense bill of $1.474 trillion. Our government will predictably be 
delivering, over the next five years, comparative savings of $245 billion. 
</P>
<P>
More can be done. My own prescribed defense program -- after a five-year 
sequence of cuts -- would cost (in 1991 dollars) $150 billion, require 1.25 
million military personnel, and provide six Army divisions and two Marine 
divisions, 11 Air Force tactical air wings, six carriers with five air wings, 
in addition to strategic nuclear forces consisting of submarine-launched 
ballistic missiles and bombers with medium-range cruise missiles. These forces, 
based on U.S. territory, would not be committed to overseas defense. This 
reduced defense program produces, over half a decade, a further cumulative 
peace dividend, beyond the $245 billion already predictable, of $350 billion. 
</P>
<P>
So more can be done -- but not without sacrificing something. Some critics have 
fallen into the convenient habit of abusing the Bush Administration for totally 
mindless conservation of the defense program. But something is at stake here on 
the level of policy. A fairly large military is necessary if the United States 
is to continue to wield global influence (beyond the requisites of our own 
national security). Critics, including myself, who opt for drastically reduced 
forces must understand that they are also opting for a diminished American role 
in a less controllable world. 
</P>
<P>
Yet I foresee such a world coming. Our country cannot afford to continue its 
global habits. What I am proposing is a military program, a force structure and 
a defense budget that are appropriate to the United States as a nation among 
nations in a post-imperial age.

AIR TRAFFIC PLAN CALLED ALREADY DATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The use of computer systems based on older technology could make a planned 
Southern California aircraft tracking facility obsolete even before it opens, 
the General Accounting Office said in a report issued this week. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, air traffic controllers may find their radar screens flickering, 
showing insufficient data or blanking out at critical moments, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared for congressional subcommittees reviewing the Federal 
Aviation Administration's appropriations requests, criticizes the agency for 
not heeding a similar GAO report last year that singled out the Los 
Angeles-Orange County air space as having the worst computer-related aircraft 
tracking problems. 
</P>
<P>
The latest report also echoes last year's National Transportation Safety Board 
study showing that the Los Angeles-Orange County area leads the nation in near 
mid-air collision reports and is dependent in part on an outdated, inadequate 
FAA radar facility at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station known as Coast 
Terminal Radar Approach Control. 
</P>
<P>
FAA officials said Tuesday that they are still analyzing the GAO report and had 
no formal reply. 
</P>
<P>
At an estimated cost of $114 million, the FAA plans to consolidate radar 
tracking facilities at Los Angeles, Burbank, El Toro and Ontario by moving 
operations to Miramar, near San Diego, by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report, entitled "Air Traffic Control -- Inadequate Planning Increases 
Risk of Computer Failures in Los Angeles," said that FAA officials have refused 
to consider computer solutions that would solve the computer capacity problem 
because the agency does not want to rewrite or develop software to run on new, 
state-of-the-art hardware and expend the "additional time they believe would be 
required to undertake such an effort." 
</P>
<P>
The study accused the FAA of refusing to use proper growth rates for projecting 
future air traffic.

MAN SLAIN ON WAY TO VACATION WITH FAMILY 
</P>

A West Covina man bound for a family vacation in Hawaii was fatally shot 
Tuesday as he waited for an airport shuttle bus with his wife, their daughter 
and two grandchildren, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond G. Shield, 61, was pronounced dead shortly after the 5 a.m. attack 
outside a Holiday Inn, where he and his family were planning to catch a bus to 
Los Angeles International Airport, West Covina police said. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, 57, their daughter, 32, and the two grandchildren, both 8, were 
unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives were investigating the possibility that the shooting on East Garvey 
Avenue was the result of a robbery attempt, Officer Steve Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Shield was unloading luggage from his car when two men pulled up behind him in 
a pickup truck. They popped the truck's hood, giving the impression they were 
having engine problems, and gestured for Shield to come over, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
"He went over there to see what he could do for them, and from that point on 
we're not sure what happened," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The three talked for a moment, but when Shield turned to walk away, one of the 
men pulled a pistol and fired at him, Cook said. The bullet passed through 
Shield's arm and lodged in his abdomen. He was taken to Inter-Community Medical 
Center in Covina, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, both thought to be in their early 20s, climbed back into the truck 
and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the vehicle as a late-model Nissan pickup, black or navy 
blue, with chrome wheels and a slightly lowered chassis. A horizontal stripe 
was painted on the truck from the doors to the tailgate, police said. An 
"Oakley" sunglasses sticker was on the rear window. 
</P>
<P>
"It appeared to be one of those random things that just happen," Cook said.

A WACKY NIGHT IN BASEBALL;

TWINS PULL OFF 2 TRIPLE PLAYS -- AND LOSE, 1-0 
</P>

<P>
The Minnesota Twins became the first team in major league history to turn two 
triple plays in one game Monday night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't even help the Twins win. An unearned run in the fifth inning gave the 
Red Sox a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The triple plays, in the fourth and eighth innings, came on almost identical 
plays, sharp grounders to third baseman Gary Gaetti near the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bolton (3-0) held the Twins to five hits in eight innings and Jeff Reardon 
came on after Bolton walked the leadoff man in the ninth to get his 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins' Scott Erickson pitched a perfect three innings before loading the 
bases on a walk, a double and another walk. Tom Brunansky hit the grounder, 
Gaetti grabbed the ball, stepped on third, threw to second baseman Al Newman 
for the second out and Newman's throw to first baseman Kent Hrbek beat 
Brunansky. 
</P>
<P>
There were runners on first and second in the eighth when Jody Reed hit the 
grounder off relief pitcher John Candelaria to Gaetti, who once again went 
around the horn for the three outs. 
</P>
<P>
Gaetti has started five double plays in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Gaetti said he told Wade Boggs, the runner on third in the fourth inning, to 
get ready for a triple play. 
</P>
<P>
"He just looked at me and spit," Gaetti said. "I think he rolled his eyes, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, in first place in the East by a half-game over Toronto, could only 
joke about it afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, (Manager Joe Morgan) always says we have to stay away from the double 
plays," pitcher Dennis Lamp said. "We did." 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he was still nervous about it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's unbelievable," he said. "I just figured we were going to win the 
ballgame after the second one." 
</P>
<P>
The record for triple plays by a team in a season is three. It has been 
accomplished six times. Oakland and Boston did it most recently, in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson (1-2) had the Red Sox, who lost eight of their previous nine games, 
hitting the ball on the ground. In the fifth, though, Mike Greenwell's grounder 
went through shortstop Greg Gagne's legs for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Pena singled and Greenwell took third on a forceout at second. Rookie 
shortstop Tim Naehring singled to score Greenwell for his first major league 
run batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 7, Detroit 3 -- The White Sox's chances of cutting Oakland's lead in 
the West didn't look too good in the first inning at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers scored three runs and had Melido Perez within a pitch of coming out 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Perez (9-7), who pitched a six-inning no-hitter against New York last Thursday, 
gave up hits to the first three batters he faced. But he gave up only one hit 
in the next six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Morris (8-11) pitched four hitless innings, but lost it in the fifth. Dan 
Pasqua hit a two-run homer in the sixth to put the White Sox in front and they 
went on to win for the 12th time in their last 13 road games. 
</P>
<P>
"We already knew the Athletics had lost," Manager Jeff Torborg of the White Sox 
said. "I was proud of the way Melido hung in there and the way we came back. It 
was a big victory." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 4, Oakland 2 -- Greg Swindell (5-5) won for the first time in eight 
starts on the road, but he wasn't bragging about it. 
</P>
<P>
Swindell, facing a crippled Oakland lineup, gave up six hits, and one earned 
run in 6 2/3 innings. Mark McGwire hit his 23rd home run. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson and Carney Lansford, the batters at the top of the Athletics' 
lineup, and second baseman Willie Randolph were out of action because of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"You are more at ease with Henderson and Lansford out," Swindell said, "but it 
was nice to win one on the road." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire was in a five for 41 slump. His home run, after Jose Canseco reached 
when Dion James dropped his long fly, made the score 2-2 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Cory Snyder doubled in the seventh and scored the go-ahead run on Jerry 
Browne's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three injured Oakland players are expected to play in today's 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
"It's of concern," Manager Tony La Russa said. "But I'm proud of the way this 
club has overcome adversity." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 5, Texas 3 -- After a shaky start, Pete Harnisch retired 22 
consecutive batters at Baltimore, and the Orioles handed the Rangers their 
third consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Harnisch (8-5) gave up a run in the first, but was perfect thereafter until 
Geno Petralli opened the ninth with a single. Julio Franco doubled with two out 
and Gregg Olson relieved, giving up a two-run single to Rafael Palmeiro before 
getting his 20th save. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 7, Toronto 5 -- Alvin Davis hit a grand slam in the sixth inning at 
Seattle and scored what proved to be the winning run in the eighth inning.

Although Deion Sanders has never decked Bo Jackson on a football field, he KO'd 
him on a baseball field Tuesday night. And it cost Jackson the chance to tie 
the major league record of four home runs in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson homered his first three times up in Kansas City's 10-7 victory over the 
New York Yankees. But he partially dislocated his left shoulder diving for 
Sanders' inside-the-park homer in the sixth inning and had to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best performance I've ever seen by an individual in a major league 
game," Kansas City Royal Manager John Wathan said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson hit two-run homers in the first and third innings off Andy Hawkins 
(1-8) and hit a three-run shot off Hawkins in the fifth. The third home run 
gave Jackson 19 for the season and 100 for his career. 
</P>
<P>
But he never got an opportunity to tie the record. Sanders' hit rolled to the 
wall for a two-run homer that pulled New York to within 8-7. Jackson, clearly 
frustrated, had to come out. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly didn't expect a night like I had, especially getting hurt," 
Jackson said. "But the X-rays came back negative and I should be all right in a 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt great up until the ball I tried to dive for. I didn't go out and try to 
hit three home runs, but all three pitches were right in my zone." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was taken to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to have the shoulder 
X-rayed. Wathan said the Royals believe it was a partial dislocation in which 
the bone pops out of the joint and pops back in. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll be able to play in a few days," Wathan said. "Usually what 
happens in this case is you're out a couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
Wathan, like the fans, was disappointed Jackson didn't have a chance to bat 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he would have electrified Yankee Stadium just coming up to the plate a 
fourth time," the Kansas City manager said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, who also plays defensive back for the Atlanta Falcons, has been a 
rival of Jackson, a running back for the Raiders. The two haven't met in a 
football game since 1985, when Jackson's Auburn team played Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran all through us, over me and everybody," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's first two homers were monster shots. He followed George Brett's 
first-inning walk with a 412-foot drive over the center-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
After Bill Pecota led off the third with his first home run in a year, Hawkins 
walked Brett again and Jackson hit a 464-foot, opposite-field homer halfway up 
the right- field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
"That ball got so small so fast," Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
The third home run was more modest, a 328-foot, opposite-field fly down the 
line that gave Kansas City an 8-1 lead. Hawkins gave up a single to Kevin 
Seitzer and a double to Brett, but chose to pitch to Jackson rather than walk 
him with first base open. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Manager Stump Merrill made the decision to face Jackson and Hawkins 
concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no other thing to do," Hawkins said. "They've got two left-handers 
coming up after that and they're both good hitters (Gerald Perry and Jim 
Eisenreich). I wanted to go after him anyway. The guy's just hit two home runs 
off me." 
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh three-homer game in the major leagues this season and it 
matched the Kansas City club record for homers in a game. The seven RBIs also 
tied the Royals' record. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, who has not won since May 6, has not pitched well since early July, 
when he lost a no-hitter to Chicago, 4-0, on unearned runs, and lost to 
Minnesota, 2-0, after pitching 11 shutout innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He's adjusted," Hawkins said of Jackson. "The first at-bat when I got two 
strikes on him he choked up 1 1/2, two inches." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Wilson, who replaced Jackson, hit a two-run single in the seventh. He 
singled in the ninth, giving Kansas City five hits and nine RBIs from the 
cleanup spot.

PORT IS SHOWN THE BRIGHT SIDE OF SEASON, 8-1; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: BEFORE GAME AGAINST MILWAUKEE, ANGRY GENERAL MANAGER SAYS HE WILL MAKE 
TRADES IF NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE IMPROVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels' only consistency this season lies in their inconsistency, a trait 
that prompted General Manager Mike Port to say before Tuesday's game that 
unproductive players must "flat out start showing results," and add that he is 
open to trade offers. 
</P>
<P>
His players didn't hear of his statements until after they had beaten the 
Milwaukee Brewers, 8-1, exhibiting the talent Port believes they have -- but 
don't always exploit. But they agreed that consistently good pitching and 
consistently respectable production are essential if they are to make any kind 
of push toward the top of the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
"Consistency is what separates the good teams from the mediocre teams," Brian 
Downing said. "We still haven't been consistent and at this point, we can't 
even settle for consistent. We've got to be awesome. Consistent isn't going to 
do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Kirk McCaskill (7-6) did his job, ending a personal three-game 
losing streak thanks to an adjustment in his delivery that had him ducking his 
head less and seeing the strike zone better. McCaskill, who lasted seven 
innings, gave up only four hits and an unearned run, in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't done well against Milwaukee in the past, and I really had to focus," 
he said. "And the lead helped a lot." 
</P>
<P>
That lead was built largely by Downing, who hit his eighth home run of the 
season in the seventh; Lance Parrish, who hit a two-run double in the third; 
and Dante Bichette, who hit a three-run home run to deepest center in the fifth 
against starter Ted Higuera (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Lee Stevens got his second major league RBI in his second game to 
complete the Angels' turnaround from Monday, when they scored one run in 
support of Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"Against Toronto, we stayed with a club that's contending in the other division 
and on other nights we're non-productive," Port said. "We've got a couple of 
weeks left in July before the trading deadline, and we've got a couple of guys 
who are not being productive. Maybe they're too comfortable in California." 
</P>
<P>
Port declined to identify the players or say whether he has conducted trade 
talks. "We're ready to do business with other clubs and get somebody who will 
help us the rest of this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very, very patient, and I'm not saying we want to do something 
that's going to turn everything asunder. But if some people are going to 
underachieve, maybe they can help somebody else and we can get back somebody 
who can help us climb the steep hill we face." 
</P>
<P>
Port said the organization is disappointed with the club's seasonlong inability 
to challenge the A's and White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating when you know a guy has the ability and has shown it but for 
some reason just doesn't employ his abilities consistently," said Port, who is 
considered a conservative trader. 
</P>
<P>
"If you rate clubs on ability, we're right near the top of the standings. The 
question becomes, have we employed those abilities and gotten results? That's 
where we've fallen down and substantially underachieved. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of talent and capability on this club, but it's got to manifest 
itself in the form of scoring runs. I want to make clear that none of our 
problems have come from lack of effort. . . . We go around the clubhouse 
position by position and, on the basis of ability, say, 'We'd be hard-pressed 
to do better.' But in terms of productivity, maybe we'd better start thinking 
of something else. . . . Potential unrealized becomes a worthless commodity." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader said the addition of Stevens and the change in direction 
from individual feats to team goals could bring about better results. 
</P>
<P>
"The injuries, we can't do anything about. It's time for people to respond," 
Rader said. "We have people who have done the job for us and we have people who 
have given us limited production. It's important they know they will be called 
upon to increase their production. 
</P>
<P>
"This might be a very important time for the overall mood of this team to 
change." 
</P>
<P>
If not the personnel. "I don't think it's out of the question for us to make 
some moves," said Parrish, whom Port singled out as fully playing to his 
potential. "We're struggling offensively and if we want to stay in contention, 
we're going to have to consider it. Tonight was a good night (offensively), but 
on the whole, we're just not consistent." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill agreed. "We're not consistent enough," he said, "and until we can 
correct that . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He left his sentence unfinished. The season is far from finished, too, Luis 
Polonia noted. "We've been up and down a lot, but I haven't seen this team 
up-up," he said. "I think we can do that. Always, in the first half (of the 
season) you try. The second half is not to try out anymore -- it's to produce." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although the standard 10-day requirement has not passed, Devon White was 
eligible to be recalled from triple-A Edmonton because a disabling injury 
opened a roster spot. The Angels chose to bring up Ron Tingley, a third catcher 
behind back-up Bill Schroeder, who has had arm trouble. "We sent Devon White 
out for a reason, and that was to recapture the consistency that can make him a 
great player," Manager Doug Rader said. White was sent down July 6 and reported 
July 12, after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston, speaking Tuesday of losing his 11th game of the season Monday 
night, 3-1: "It gets to me a little bit the night I pitch, but then I try to 
get rid of it. I refuse to let it get to me. I've got a loving, caring family 
that cares for me at home, good or bad."

MIKE DOWNEY: DIMAGGIO -- NO, NOT JOE -- GOES PUBLIC TO CAPTURE SPIRIT OF '41 
</P>

<P>
Dom DiMaggio, like his brother, likes his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
So, when the book people called, he automatically said no. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew what they wanted," he said. "They wanted something about Joe." 
</P>
<P>
One day, though, someone ran a different notion by Dom: A book about 1941. 
</P>
<P>
If ever the major leagues had a magical, almost mythic year, it was 1941. There 
was Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak. There was Ted Williams' .406 batting 
average. There was the anticipated, but nonetheless gripping, death of Lou 
Gehrig. There was Mickey Owen's dropped third strike in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
And beyond the outfield walls, there was a worried America, waiting and 
watching as World War II headed its way. Two months after the 1941 World 
Series, the Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
For a year that had begun so pleasantly, with Dom DiMaggio driving his new 
Packard cross-country to spring camp, 1941 took increasingly dramatic turns 
with every page of the calendar. With its 50th anniversary approaching, the 
summer of '41 seemed a hell of an idea for a book. 
</P>
<P>
But something inside Dom made him still say no. He didn't want any of the 
attention, any of the notoriety, any of the publicity that such a book might 
bring about. He liked the quiet life he led in Massachusetts and Florida, liked 
the idea of keeping it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"It nagged at me, though," he said. "The more I thought about it, the more 
memories of 1941 came flooding back to me. I liked the idea better and better." 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of weeks, Dom called the book people. 
</P>
<P>
"Still want the book about 1941?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, they did. 
</P>
<P>
It's out now -- "Real Grass, Real Heroes," (Zebra, $18.95), a collaboration by 
DiMaggio and author Bill Gilbert that takes us back to a time unlike any other 
in American history, on and off the ballfields. And it is told through the eyes 
of one of baseball's truly underappreciated players. 
</P>
<P>
Dom DiMaggio did not have any 56-game hitting streaks, did not marry Marilyn 
Monroe, did not have any songs written about him, but he did make eight 
All-Star teams, did play alongside Ted Williams, did play a mean center field. 
He was a DiMaggio, all right. 
</P>
<P>
In the field, he played shallow and daringly, the way Tris Speaker had before 
him or Paul Blair did later. Dom can still recall the dinner he had with his 
older brother in 1941, after they played on opposite sides when the Boston Red 
Sox came to Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you always play that shallow?" Joe asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" Dom asked back. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you might want to back up a few steps," Joe said. "The wind here is 
deceiving. The flags make it look like it's blowing in, when it's really 
blowing out." 
</P>
<P>
Good tip, Dom thought. Next day, he moved back seven or eight steps. And when 
his brother stepped up and hit one a country mile, Dom raced back and caught 
it, with barely a step to spare. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the last time I give you advice," Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
For the book, Dom DiMaggio sought no advice, did not disturb his brother. He 
did, however, go to see old friends such as Williams, Owen, Tommy Henrich, Ken 
Keltner and others, to jot down their recollections of 1941. 
</P>
<P>
They all remembered not only the history-making developments on the field, but 
the subsequent rationing of food and fuel, the manufacturing of weapons and 
munitions at America's factories, and the number of baseball players who, one 
by one, went off to serve their country. 
</P>
<P>
Dom, doing his part, went down to the federal building in Boston and asked to 
enlist in the Navy. When his eyes were checked, he couldn't see a thing without 
his glasses. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor said, 'Move as close to the eye chart as you have to until you can 
read something.' So, just to make a point, I walked right into the wall," Dom 
remembers. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he got his wish, serving in Australia and the Philippines. He even 
refused to play for the camp ballclub at one point unless he was guaranteed a 
chance to become a chief petty officer, after first being denied. The Navy 
caved in. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear about guys holding out on their contracts," Dom said. "I held out on 
the entire United States Navy." 
</P>
<P>
The majors had players coming and going during the war. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this ring," Dom said, removing it from his finger. "We played an 
All-Star game in Cleveland with the active ballplayers against the guys who 
were in the service. I think they gave us a $25 war bond for it. The rings we 
had made ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Huge contracts and rewards are just part of the changing game to DiMaggio, who 
detects a brashness in today's players that did not exist in his day. He 
particularly liked the way Carlton Fisk of the Chicago White Sox got on Yankee 
Deion Sanders' case for not running out a pop fly. 
</P>
<P>
Pride is an important part of any player's makeup, and it comes in many forms. 
For Dom DiMaggio, there is pride in the fact that he batted .298 lifetime, 
missed the All-Star lineup only when injuries affected his play, and still 
found time to serve his country. 
</P>
<P>
His idea of a ballplayer is Ted Williams, the last man to hit .400, the man who 
homered in his last at-bat and never so much as tipped his cap on the way back 
to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"That line from that (Frank Sinatra) song fits Ted," Dom said. " 'I ate it up, 
and spat it out.' " 
</P>
<P>
During part of DiMaggio's career, sacrifice flies counted as official at-bats. 
One day Tommy Henrich ran back and caught one of Dom's deep drives in the ninth 
inning, with no chance of throwing out the baserunner tagging up at third. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, when Dom looked him up, Henrich said: "Did I cost you .300?" 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio said: "No, I'd have needed a few more hits for .300." 
</P>
<P>
"Good," Henrich said. "It's been bothering me."

Chuck DeBus, a Los Angeles track and field coach, has been suspended for life 
by The Athletics Congress for his alleged role in promoting the use of 
performance-enhancing drugs by athletes he coached. 
</P>
<P>
A three-person panel of TAC, the sport's governing body in the United States, 
found in an opinion released Tuesday that DeBus was guilty of "inciting 
athletes to use banned substances, guilty of providing banned substances to an 
athlete, and guilty of conduct detrimental to the purposes of The Athletics 
Congress and amateur sports." 
</P>
<P>
The lifetime ban on three counts is the strongest action the panel could take 
under the rules. DeBus was given a 15-year suspension on another count. It is 
the first time an American coach has been sanctioned under rules regarding drug 
use or distribution. 
</P>
<P>
A TAC news release stated that DeBus was suspended from track and field for 
life, but it is unclear if that is wholly accurate. According to the release, 
the panel's decision expelled DeBus from TAC. That means that DeBus may not 
coach any national teams such as the Olympic team and may not enter athletes 
into TAC-sanctioned events. 
</P>
<P>
That might be the limit of the sanction. It does not appear to prohibit DeBus 
from coaching any athlete he chooses. 
</P>
<P>
A panel member conceded that the decision does not prevent DeBus from coaching, 
saying, "I don't see how it could, other than what it does for his reputation." 
</P>
<P>
A TAC spokesman said he did not know what the appeals process is in this case 
but that the question is "under review." 
</P>
<P>
TAC said miler Steve Scott and hurdler Tonie Campbell testified before the 
panel last April that DeBus urged them to take banned substances. Darryl 
Robinson, a 400-meter specialist, testified that DeBus had given him banned 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
The TAC release quotes the 52-page opinion as saying Scott told the panel that 
in 1987 DeBus offered to assist him in setting up a program of blood doping 
and/or steroid use. Campbell said that during the 1985 season DeBus told him 
that steroids would improve his ability, and Robinson testified that DeBus had 
assisted him in obtaining and using steroids from 1985 through '87. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, DeBus said he "did not encourage drug use; absolutely did not 
incite drug use, had never used drugs, had never purchased drugs, had never 
been arrested for drugs and had never possessed drugs." 
</P>
<P>
DeBus, 45, has coached at UCLA and Cal State Northridge, where his women's 
teams won four national titles. He also coached the now-defunct Los Angeles 
Track Club from 1971 through '88; the club won nine TAC team titles. DeBus had 
been under investigation since May of 1989, when some of his former athletes 
made public allegations that he had offered or provided banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
DeBus' attorney, Craig Dummit, said Tuesday that the decision was more a public 
relations announcement than anything else. He said that he intended to exhaust 
all appeals within TAC and then, if necessary, take DeBus' case to civil court. 
</P>
<P>
"TAC won the first round using themselves as judges," Dummit said. "Once we get 
a neutral judge in court, we will score a quick knockout." 
</P>
<P>
The panel consisted of William Hickman, a Seattle attorney; Julie McKinney, a 
San Pedro attorney, and Rich Nichols, a San Francisco sports consultant. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney said the panel members were not trying to send a message with the 
lifetime suspension, merely adhering to the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't now what the legislative intent (of the rules) was, but my own opinion 
is that a person who is in a position of dominance over athletes (and advises 
them to use drugs) should be dealt with strongly," McKinney said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that although the panel was offered no physical evidence or any 
evidence to corroborate the testimony of the three athletes, the panel members 
believed the athletes were credible. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing process for DeBus has a fitful history, having been rescheduled six 
times. At one point, an attorney for TAC and DeBus struck a deal by which the 
coach would voluntarily step down from the sport for two years in exchange for 
the names of athletes DeBus said were drug users. However, the deal fell 
through when the panel members protested. TAC attorney, Alvin Chriss, has since 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the TAC panel held a hearing at a hotel near Los Angeles 
International Airport. After two days of testimony by Scott, Robinson, Campbell 
and DeBus, the panel adjourned without rendering a decision. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion was formulated over three months and a handful of conference calls 
among the three members.

DAVIS (STRAINED BACK) JOINS JOYNER ON ANGEL'S CROWDED DISABLED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels placed outfielder Chili Davis on the 15-day disabled list with a 
strained lower back Tuesday, one day after placing Wally Joyner on the disabled 
list. 
</P>
<P>
The move leaves the Angels without their second- and third-best run-producers. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Parrish leads the team in runs batted in with 44. Joyner is second with 
41 RBIs, and Davis third with 40. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who will be under (any) strain will be the people who haven't been 
producing very well for us this year," Manager Doug Rader said. "It's up to 
them to pick up some of the slack." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' .247 team batting average is last in the American League. They are 
batting .216 with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 30, has been bothered by his back since July 2 and had not played in the 
past three games. He was put on the list retroactive to Saturday. The move 
marked the 11th time this season the Angels have placed a player on the DL, 
surpassing last season's total of nine. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels recalled catcher Ron Tingley from triple-A Edmonton to replace 
Davis, who plays outfield and designated hitter and is batting .272 with 10 
home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Tingley, 31, appeared in four games with the Angels during the final month of 
last season. He was batting .267 with five home runs and 23 RBIs in 54 games 
with Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels also transferred pitcher Greg Minton from the 15-day list to the 
21-day list to make room for Davis. ROBYN NORWOOD

THIS SCOTTISH COURSE IS ANCIENT, BUT NO LESS ROYAL; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: A BRITISH OPEN VICTORY AT ST. ANDREWS STILL IS THE SUPREME SYMBOL OF 
SUCCESS FOR THE GAME'S BEST PLAYERS.

ST. ANDREWS, Scotland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Why are there always 18 holes on a golf course? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Because in 1764, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews needed 
some room and cut up what had been 22 holes to leave 18. Eighteen has been the 
standard ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why do golf courses have an "out" nine and an "in" nine? 
</P>
<P>
A: Because in 1552, when Scotsmen started playing the game in the Kingdome of 
Fife, along the bluffs above St. Andrews Bay on the North Sea, they played in a 
direct line from the clubhouse to the River Eden, where they turned around and 
came back. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is a golf cup 4 1/4 inches in diameter? 
</P>
<P>
A: Because when the members of St. Andrews decided in 1891 that the size needed 
to be uniform, they choose 4 1/4 inches. For the first 300 years, there was no 
official size. 
</P>
<P>
When the Royal and Ancient speaks, the golf world listens. And obeys. 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost. 
</P>
<P>
One R&amp;A idea that didn't catch on was not charging greens fees to play. 
Until 1913, all a person -- resident or visitor -- had to do to play the Old 
Course at St. Andrews was walk out to the first tee and hit away. For players 
to get that concession, however, residents were given permission to raise 
rabbits on the north side of the links and hang out their fish nets on the 
fairways. 
</P>
<P>
Hitting away Thursday will be 156 of the finest golfers in the world, from 
defending champion Mark Calcavecchia, Curtis Strange and Jack Nicklaus of the 
United States to Greg Norman of Australia, Ian Woosnam of Wales, Nick Faldo of 
Britain and Seve Ballesteros and Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the 24th time in 119 years that the British Open -- it is referred 
to in Britain only as The Open -- has been held here at the legendary 
birthplace of golf. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that people batted a ball along the ground with sticks from 
point to point before St. Andrews, but there is something almost mystical about 
the Old Course because it has remained virtually the same through all the 
centuries. It is as if the original baseball diamond laid out by Abner 
Doubleday at Cooperstown, N.Y., was the site of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
When a golfer walks up to the first tee, sticks his tee in the turf only a few 
feet from the R&amp;A clubhouse and looks down at what must be the widest 
fairway in the world, there is a sense of history that is awesome. If goose 
pimples could be marketed, a fortune could be made when the realization hits 
that not only Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead and Bobby Jones stood 
there, but also Old Tom and Young Tom Morris, Mungo Park, Willie Fernie and 
Harry Vardon, all of whom won the Open before Nicklaus, Palmer, Snead or even 
Jones were born. 
</P>
<P>
The Open was first held in 1860 at Prestwick, which played host to 12 of them 
before St. Andrews got into the act. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kidd was the first winner here in 1893, shooting a 91-88 -- 179, certainly 
the worst 36-hole score ever to win a major championship. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring was different then, however. A torrential rain left St. Andrews heavy 
with water, turning the swale in front of the 18th green, called the Valley of 
Sin, into a small lake. In 1873, there was no such thing as casual water. If a 
shot ended up in a puddle, it cost a stroke if it was lifted and dropped on dry 
land. 
</P>
<P>
The Open wasn't such a big deal back then, even at St. Andrews. Three years 
later, when the captain of the club neglected to reserve the course for two 
days for the Open, the members demanded their regularly scheduled tee times. 
The tournament players wound up being interspersed with local regulars. The 
ensuing confusion helped cause Bob Martin's winning score of 176 to be 
perilously close to Kidd's record high total. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until 1892, for the 32nd Open, that the tournament was expanded from 
36 to 72 holes. 
</P>
<P>
John Henry Taylor became the first to win consecutive Opens at St. Andrews, 
shooting a 322 in 1895 and a 309 in 1900. This sudden improvement in scoring, 
which was attributed to a switch from the old gutta-percha ball to the 
core-wound ball, did not go unnoticed by the moguls of St. Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
Their reaction was to pock the course with deep pot bunkers, barely big enough, 
according to golf historian Robert Burnet, "for an angry man and his sand 
iron." 
</P>
<P>
James Braid repeated Taylor's successive victories here, in 1905 and 1910, a 
feat that would not again be done until Nicklaus did it in 1970 and 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Few Americans entered, and none won, the Open before World War I. When it was 
resumed, Jock Hutchinson, a native of St. Andrews who was a naturalized 
American citizen, became the first U.S. winner in 1921 on what had been his 
home course. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson made a hole in one on the eighth hole in the first round and almost 
made one on the next hole, the 356-yard ninth, when he caught a drive with the 
wind at his back. A spectator, apparently seeing the ball rolling toward the 
hole, raced across the green and pulled the pin. The ball rolled over the hole, 
and other spectators said it might have fallen in had the pin been in place. 
</P>
<P>
That was also the year that a teen-ager, Bobby Jones, got so mad during the 
third round -- when he had trouble getting out of a pesky pot bunker on the 
11th hole -- that he tore up his scorecard and stalked off the course. 
</P>
<P>
Jones returned the next time the Open was at St. Andrews, in 1927, and won the 
second of his three championships. He had won in 1926 at Royal Lytham and would 
win again in his Grand Slam year of 1930 at Hoylake, two weeks after winning 
the British Amateur at St. Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
Densmore Shute beat Craig Wood in a playoff in 1933, becoming the last American 
to win at St. Andrews before World War II closed the course again, this time 
for six years. Gene Sarazen appeared to have that Open in hand, before he took 
a triple-bogey six on No. 11 -- the same hole that had given Jones fits. 
</P>
<P>
Sarazen, in the bunker that had entrapped Jones, later called it "the most 
dreadful bunker in all of golf." 
</P>
<P>
Three holes later, at the 14th, he made another triple bogey when his second 
shot landed in Hell Bunker. He finished a stroke behind Shute and Wood. 
</P>
<P>
Snead came in 1946, complaining loudly about how much he disliked the course, 
but he won by four strokes over South Africa's Bobby Locke and never came back. 
</P>
<P>
Snead's complaints apparently were taken to heart by American professionals 
because for the next 12 years the British Open was virtually boycotted by U.S. 
players, except for 1953, when Ben Hogan made his only European voyage to win 
at Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer revived interest in the tournament when he came to St. Andrews in the 
Centennial Open of 1960, as the only top-ranking American, and lost by a shot 
to Kel Nagle of Australia. Palmer won the next two years, at Royal Birkdale and 
Troon, and since then, American golfers have won 15 of the 27 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, now 60, is here for what he says will be his final British Open. It is 
the 22nd time in 30 years that he has played. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is appropriate that I make this my final one, here at St. Andrews, 
where I started 30 years ago," he said. "Winnie (his wife) and I have the same 
suite at Rusacks Hotel we had 30 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
There is a longstanding theory about St. Andrews that you need to play here a 
few times in order to win, though some players would discount that. 
</P>
<P>
Champagne Tony Lema showed up in 1964 without ever having seen St. Andrews and 
breezed to a five-shot victory over Nicklaus and Roberto de Vicenzo of 
Argentina. Nicklaus started off 76-74 when winds raked the course, and even a 
closing 66-68 was not good enough to challenge Lema. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus was not to be denied in the next two St. Andrews Opens, winning a 
playoff from Doug Sanders in 1970, and repeating in 1978 after holding off a 
challenge by a little-known New Zealander named Simon Owen. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders took three putts on the 72nd hole in 1970, missing the second one from 
three feet, to allow Nicklaus to tie. In the 18-hole playoff the next day, the 
match went down to the final hole, where Nicklaus sank an eight-foot putt from 
the same direction that Sanders had misfired the day before. The putt appeared 
to be taking the same quick break that cost Sanders the championship, then 
caught the lip of the cup and toppled in. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Jacklin, the defending champion, was on the verge of running away with the 
tournament in the opening round when he shot the outgoing nine in 29, only to 
be cut short by a violent rainstorm that postponed play. The next day, he hit 
his second shot on the 14th hole into a thicket of gorse, took a double bogey 
and finished at 67, only one shot ahead of Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is Ballesteros' turn to try to make it two Opens in a row at St. 
Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fiery Spaniard's play on the legendary Road Hole, No. 17, that 
brought him his second of three British Open titles in 1984. The hole is a 
461-yard dogleg, considered by many as the toughest par-four in golf. 
</P>
<P>
When Ballesteros made a par by hitting a six-iron second shot from the rough 
that landed on the green close enough to get down in two putts, he said he felt 
like he'd made a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
"The six-iron at 17, the more I look at the shot, the more impressed I get with 
myself," Ballesteros said Tuesday after a practice round. "If you look very 
close where I was and how (little) room on the green to put the ball right 
there, I guess I was very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
The victory came when Tom Watson, a five-time British Open winner -- but not at 
St. Andrews -- gambled and lost on the same hole. Watson pushed his tee shot so 
far to the right that he thought it was out of bounds, but it was in by about 
six feet. He hit his second shot, a two-iron, even worse. The ball hit the road 
and bounced against a stone wall, but instead of caroming back toward the 
green, it stopped in a depression about two feet from the wall. With no room to 
maneuver a chip shot, he flailed at the ball and sent it skidding across the 
green, 30 feet past the pin. 
</P>
<P>
When he missed the long putt and took a bogey five, Ballesteros began 
celebrating. The championship was his. 
</P>
<P>
Watson hopes some of Ballesteros' magic will rub off on him this week. He has 
Nick de Paul, Seve's old caddie, carrying his bags. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret to winning at St. Andrews is to keep out of the bunkers, and Seve 
never knocked it in a fairway bunker all four days," Watson said. "Nick got a 
lot of credit for that, keeping him alert to where he needed to aim his drives. 
You can't see most of them from the tee, so you need help." 
</P>
<P>
So the Old Course, drying out in a midsummer sun after Monday night's 
drenching, is waiting for another challenge, as it has done for hundreds of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to say when you have won twice here, but nevertheless, Nicklaus 
probably summed up the feelings of most players when he said: "To be 
remembered, you have to win at St. Andrews."

CATCH OFF SAN DIEGO 'A REAL VARIETY PACK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The game fish found last week by San Diego's sportfishers have yet to move 
north as expected, but skippers operating on an overnight schedule are 
reporting a vastly improved albacore bite and steady catches of other exotic 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Some captains reported catching more than 50 albacore by early Tuesday 
afternoon. Buzz Brizendine, skipper of the Prowler, told Phil Friedman of 
976-TUNA over the marine radio that his passengers boated 60 of the longfin 
tuna in one stop Monday. "This stuff is averaging 18 pounds. It's a beautiful 
grade of fish," Brizendine said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the variety, Brizendine added: "In the same area there's dorado, there's 
bluefin tuna up to 35 pounds, there's yellowtail, there have been both bigeye 
tuna and yellowfin tuna caught (Monday) and this morning -- and the skipjack 
(tuna) are there; it's just a real variety pack once you get there." 
</P>
<P>
The fish are still being found about 140 miles south of Pt. Loma. A band of 
dirty water -- about 115 miles south of the landings -- still exists and is 
believed to be thwarting the northward movement of the fish. 
</P>
<P>
However, Michael Laurs, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
said late last week that he expects the dirty water to dissipate, thus 
providing an avenue for the fish. 
</P>
<P>
The largest billfish of the season -- an 858-pound blue marlin caught July 10 
by Bellflower's Mike Pierce -- highlights some of the best marlin fishing this 
year off the southern Baja California peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"The marlin bite is excellent, better than excellent," said Darrell Primrose of 
Tortuga Sportfishing. "I had five boats out (Monday); they had 10 marlin, two 
sailfish, some dorado to 45 pounds and a couple of tuna around the 30- to 
40-pound range. They leave the dock at 7:30 a.m., and every boat was back by 1 
o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, 38, a McDonnell Douglas employee, was fishing aboard the Gaviota fleet 
and trolling a light-green marlin lure when his fish struck at 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Five hours into the fight, the handle on the reel broke. Pierce's brother, 
John, stripped enough line from the reel, so there was enough slack to cut and 
splice the line onto that from another reel and fasten the reel to the rod 
before the marlin picked up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
It worked. Pierce boated the fish after 7 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"My arms are still tired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the top four billfish this season are blue marlin weighing 702, 
653 and 549 pounds. The largest ever caught off Cabo San Lucas is a 
1,056-pounder, by North Hollywood's John Conant aboard one of the Tortuga's 
fleet, on September 8, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
White seabass are still being targeted at Santa Rosa Island, with those aboard 
commercial and private sportfishers occasionally finding fair-sized schools of 
the powerful croakers -- and some of the other game fish the area has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Headrick of Thousand Oaks, fishing aboard Tom Palmer's 28-foot Hard Drag, 
used 20-pound test line and successive baits to land a 12-pound white seabass, 
a 47-pound halibut and a 48-pound 3-ounce yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Grant, manager of Cisco's Sportfishing in Oxnard, said it was the largest 
yellowtail he had seen. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said: "It's almost unheard of to catch a yellowtail there. Once in a 
while you get one." 
</P>
<P>
Large halibut are not uncommon, however. The world-record halibut for 20-pound 
test line -- a 53-pound 4-ounce fish caught in July 7, 1988 -- was also taken 
from the waters off Santa Rosa Island. 
</P>
<P>
Marlin fishing remains slow in Southland waters. No marlin have been weighed 
yet this season at Avalon, and the last one reported at the Balboa Angling Club 
was a catch-and-release fish on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The BAC's Jaye Apperson said Rowan Henry of Marina del Rey caught a swordfish 
Sunday. Henry was fishing 10 miles south of the Coronado Islands. He fought the 
129-pound broadbill for 10 hours 15 minutes.

FISHING REPORT: DOG-DAY AFTERNOONS ARE FINE FOR BLUEGILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's "dog-day summer fishing," according to Jim Brown, manager of the San Diego 
City lakes. 
</P>
<P>
The bass are off at most places, but the bluegill have been biting heavily at 
San Vicente and, surprisingly, Otay. Red worms or meal worms are working from 
boats and shore. 
</P>
<P>
"San Vicente has always been good for bluegill, but this is new for Otay," 
Brown said.

<P>
WEST: DEFENDING WORLD SERIES CHAMPION OPENS LEGION PLAYOFFS WITH A 10-7 
VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
What, Woodland Hills West worry? 
</P>
<P>
The defending American Legion World Series champion moved out to a 3-0 lead 
over Lancaster in the first inning of its first-round District 20 playoff game 
Tuesday afternoon at Pierce College and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
Despite giving up four runs -- two unearned -- in the ninth, Pat Treend (4-1) 
lifted West to a 10-7 win, the team's 16th victory in a row and 19th in 20 
games. West (20-4) now will take on Quartz Hill, a 5-3 winner over Panorama 
City on Tuesday, in a second-round game at 4:15 p.m. Thursday at Pierce. 
Lancaster faces Panorama City in a losers' bracket game at 4:15 p.m. today at 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat pitched a good one today," West Coach Don Hornback said of Treend, the 
City Section 4-A Division co-Player of the Year at El Camino Real in the 
spring. "The only inning he didn't look good was the last one. He was in 
control most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
West racked up 17 hits to stake Treend to a 10-3 lead before Lancaster rallied 
in the top of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Murphy, a younger brother of former Oakland Athletics' star Dwayne 
Murphy, led off the ninth with a double to the center-field fence, followed by 
a hard-hit single by George Boykins. 
</P>
<P>
Although Treend seemed to be tiring at that point, Boykins' single was the last 
solid hit of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hartman hit a slow roller to shortstop Gregg Sheren, whose throw was too 
late to catch Hartman as Murphy scored. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Eberhardt then beat out a drag bunt down the first-base line that loaded 
the bases. Lancaster third baseman David Looke struck out for the first out, 
swinging at a curve in the dirt, a high fastball, and another curve, bringing 
up Aaron Searcy. 
</P>
<P>
Searcy hit a high bouncer fielded by West third baseman Del Marine, whose throw 
sailed over first baseman Jason Cohen's head for a two-base error, scoring two 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Erroll Sprago then hit a sacrifice fly to left and Brandon Newcomb followed 
with a high fly to center for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
"We waited too long," said Lancaster Coach Mike Eberhardt. 
</P>
<P>
"Treend pitched a good game until the end when he got tired. That's what 
happens to pitchers this time of year. He's pitched a lot this year." 
</P>
<P>
Hornback was pleased with Treend's effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to keep Pat to 110 pitches and when he got the last batter, he 
(finished at) 106," said Hornback. "We have four other guys who can come in and 
throw strikes so I wasn't worried." 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster missed right fielder Heath Fine, who is on vacation. West's eighth 
and ninth runs scored in the seventh inning when right fielder Jake Cox, who 
entered the game in the top of the inning, let Marine's fly ball drop behind 
him for a three-base error, scoring two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster committed three errors -- two of which contributed to runs -- behind 
starter and loser Kevin Branch. 
</P>
<P>
Marine and designated-hitter Greg Lederman each went three for four with two 
runs batted in for West. Catcher Bobby Kim also had two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Eberhardt led Lancaster with three hits and three RBIs.

BIG SKY SCHOOL SIGNS VALLEY'S DELAITTRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shawn DeLaittre, a former Valley College and Simi Valley High standout, has 
signed a letter of intent to play basketball at Eastern Washington University 
of the Big Sky Conference. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaittre signed Monday after a recent visit to the school. He will enter 
Eastern Washington as an academic junior after earning an associate of arts 
degree at Valley in the spring. He has three years of athletic eligibility 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Washington narrowly missed a berth in the NCAA tournament last season. 
The Eagles (18-11) placed second in the Big Sky with an 11-5 record before 
losing, 65-62, to Idaho in the conference tournament final. The Eagles are 
scheduled to play Cal State Northridge at home Jan. 31 and at Northridge the 
following season. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Washington's location in Cheney, just outside Spokane, and the 
opportunity to play right away for first-year Coach John Wade helped DeLaittre 
choose the school. He said he also had been recruited by USC, Nevada Reno, 
Texas A&amp;M and North Carolina Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"USC was talking to me but I probably will get more playing time at Eastern 
Washington," DeLaittre said Tuesday. "Coach Wade is a great guy and he's 
probably the main reason I went there. I'm kind of a California boy so it may 
take a while to get used to life there. But the people treated me well and it 
seems like a great place to live and go to school." 
</P>
<P>
DeLaittre, a 6-foot-5 swingman, came to Wade's attention when assistant Coach 
Rusty Smith left CSUN to join the EWU staff in June. Smith had recruited 
DeLaittre for CSUN and Wade then scouted the player at a camp in Washington 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaittre won the three-point shot competition and excelled in his first game 
at the camp, scoring 37 points, including eight three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
He starred for three seasons at Simi Valley alongside Don MacLean, now at UCLA. 
DeLaittre was a three-time All-Southern Section 4-A Division selection and led 
the Pioneers to the Southern Section title his senior season. He averaged 22.6 
points and 8.8 rebounds per game that season. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaittre left Simi Valley as the school's second all-time leading scorer -- 
behind MacLean -- with 1,704 points. He ranks third in school history in 
rebounds with 742, trailing MacLean and his father, Larry DeLaittre, who played 
in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn DeLaittre signed out of high school with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo but 
redshirted his freshman year before transferring to Valley. Last season he led 
the Monarchs to a 22-10 record and was an All-Western State Conference 
selection. In conference play, he averaged 17.5 points and 8.4 rebounds.

CASEY WILL SIT OUT FOOTBALL SEASON DUE TO SAT SCORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerome Casey of Sylmar High, perhaps the Valley's finest all-around football 
player last season, will not attend USC in the fall after failing to meet 
Proposition 48 requirements concerning the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, a running back who also played middle linebacker and safety, accepted a 
scholarship in February on the condition that he score at least 700 on the 
test, the minimum required for athletic eligibility under Prop. 48. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it's frustrating," Casey said. "It's just a test and to put it all 
on one test -- I don't think that's right. But those are the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Casey said he was unsure about his next move pending a meeting, not yet 
scheduled, with USC Coach Larry Smith. But it is likely that he will enroll in 
a junior college in the fall and continue to take the SAT. He will not play 
football in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Provided he passes the test, he likely will enroll at USC under a scholarship 
that university officials indicated will be held for him. If all goes well, 
Casey said, that could be as soon as the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
Casey's situation is reminiscent of that of Curtis Conway, a 1989 USC recruit 
out of Hawthorne High who also sat out his freshman year after failing to score 
the required 700 on the SAT. Conway attended junior college for a year and did 
not play football before passing the test. He is enrolling at USC for the fall 
semester as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Casey will lose a year of eligibility, but still plans on attending USC. Other 
schools -- such as Washington State, Nebraska and Washington -- recruited 
Casey, but the 5-foot-10, 180-pounder had his heart set on playing for the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"I always imagined myself running on the field at the Coliseum," he told The 
Times in February. "I grew up loving SC." 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, Casey, the East Valley League co-Player of the Year and a Times 
All-Valley selection, rushed for 1,447 yards, caught 14 passes for 378 yards 
and scored 26 touchdowns. He also led the team with 70 solo tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Casey will play for the East in Friday night's Daily News All-Star Game at 
Birmingham High.

HOFFMAN REPORTED OUT AT CHAMINADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Hoffman has quit as Chaminade High's basketball coach just two months 
after he accepted the job at the West Hills school, a source close to the team 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Kurowski, an assistant in the program for three years, has served as 
interim coach since Hoffman quit two weeks ago, the source added. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade Athletic Director Bernie Kyman was unavailable for comment and 
Hoffman declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, 34, was hired in May by his predecessor, Mike Lynn. Chaminade compiled 
a 134-87 record in 11 seasons under Lynn, who has left the school and will move 
his family to the Sacramento area. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman had served as Lynn's assistant and junior varsity coach for four 
seasons until he took the varsity job at St. Genevieve in 1987. After a 12-10 
season with the Valiants, Hoffman moved to Calabasas High and compiled a 22-24 
record in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
At Chaminade, he led the junior varsity to three league titles in four years, 
including a 21-1 mark in his last season. Lynn predicted a bright future for 
Hoffman when he hired him in May. 
</P>
<P>
"He's potentially one of the best coaches in the Valley," Lynn said at the 
time. "I think he'll take Chaminade a step higher."

VAN NUYS FORLORN OVER FORFEIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Prince sprinted in from center field, palms and eyebrows raised, looking 
for an explanation. He didn't like what he heard. And he doesn't like having so 
much time to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
Prince and his Van Nuys-Notre Dame teammates were trailing Panorama City, 3-1, 
in the sixth inning of the second game of a doubleheader Saturday when their 
stand-in coach, assistant Mitch Graff, booted the bat rack in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
The umpires, who earlier had ejected Graff for arguing a call, awarded a 
victory to Panorama City on a forfeit and left the field. For Prince and his 
teammates, it was more than the end of a game -- it was the end of a season. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys had won eight consecutive games to move into District 20 playoff 
contention before dropping a game to Woodland Hills West on Friday, and needed 
a mere split of Saturday's doubleheader to stay in contention for a wild-card 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 4-1, after five innings of the opener, Panorama City rallied to win, 
9-8. Down by two runs in the nightcap, Van Nuys had one more scheduled at-bat 
when the umpires called the game. 
</P>
<P>
Graff was running the team for Coach Jody Breeden, who was attending a wedding. 
When Graff re-entered the Van Nuys dugout in the sixth to issue instructions to 
the team, the umpires ordered him to leave. Graff initially balked, then kicked 
a stack of aluminum bats. 
</P>
<P>
When the umpires halted the game and Prince figured out what was taking place, 
he stormed in and demanded an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
For Prince and four other Van Nuys players -- all of whom graduated from Notre 
Dame High last month -- it was the last moment in Legion baseball. A 
less-than-favorable impression will last for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the coaches who are responsible for the players, not the players who are 
responsible for the coaches," Prince said. "There's no way it's right for the 
umps to just walk off and leave." 
</P>
<P>
Bad form: Newhall-Saugus' playoff fortunes were saved by an error. Not one of 
the standard E-6 variety, but an administrative error. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando coaching staff did not return its Form 1 registration 
application -- the officially recognized roster that is placed on permanent 
Legion file -- until after the June 20 deadline. Therefore, any game San 
Fernando won after June 20 was ruled a forfeit, district Commissioner Mel 
Swerdling said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Swerdling informed Newhall-Saugus Coach Tom Pedersen that his 
team's recent loss to San Fernando had been overturned. Because of the ruling, 
Newhall-Saugus (15-8) qualified for one of two wild-card playoff berths, one 
game ahead of Van Nuys-Notre Dame and Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
All-Stars: The first Southern California All-Star Game has been scheduled for 
Aug. 11 at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
All-stars from the 6th Area -- which includes Districts 16 and 20 of the Valley 
area -- will face players from the 4th and 5th areas, according to Swerdling, 
who helped organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th Area is in southern Los Angeles County and includes teams from the Long 
Beach region. The 5th Area is in the eastern part of the county and includes 
teams from the Claremont and Upland regions. 
</P>
<P>
Wild life: Mario Joy tossed a two-hitter in Burbank's 10-4 victory over North 
Hollywood on Saturday and had a no-hitter through six innings, but the tension 
that mounted as the game progressed wasn't typical of most no-hit bids. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Joy may have been fortunate to have won at all; any hand-wringing had 
more to do with whether he would be removed because of wildness. 
</P>
<P>
The right-hander walked 10, struck out 11 and uncorked six wild pitches. Two 
wild pitches came on strikeouts, with the batter reaching first base. Whatever 
the methodology, the hits weren't coming. 
</P>
<P>
Joy, normally a shortstop, allowed a bunt single by John Levine to open the 
seventh. In the ninth, the Burbank first baseman seemed to be in position to 
flag Cassidy Pope's dribbler down the line, but the grounder bounced off the 
bag for a scratch single. 
</P>
<P>
Making his pitch: Joe Tushnet had been after Reseda Coach Howard Randall all 
season. "Gimme the ball," Tushnet said. "How tough can it be?" 
</P>
<P>
Tushnet, who was selected to the District 20 All-Star Game as an outfielder, 
wanted to try his hand on the pitcher's mound. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the final day of regular-season play, Tushnet got his shot. He 
started and lasted 1 1/3 innings in an 11-3 loss to Chatsworth, allowing two 
runs in the first and three in the second. 
</P>
<P>
The reviews were mixed, which is more than Randall could say about Tushnet's 
repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't throw slow enough to have a good changeup," Randall said, "and he 
doesn't throw fast enough to have a good fastball."

John McEnroe, making his first tournament appearance since an opening-round 
loss at Wimbledon, defeated Paul Chamberlin, 6-2, 6-3, in a second-round match 
of the Sovran Bank Classic at Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded McEnroe did not face a break point until the final game of the 
match and he broke Chamberlin in the sixth game of each set. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I played pretty well," McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm eager to try to play my best, my absolute best. I feel my game coming 
along, but it takes time." 
</P>
<P>
Said Chamberlain: "We both played bad. I think (McEnroe) needs to do more with 
his court preparation and focus back on his game." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe's last tournament victory came against Brad Gilbert March 5, 1989, in 
the WCT finals at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, defending champion Tim Mayotte scored a 6-2, 6-1 victory over 
India's Ramesh Krishnan. Second-seeded Brad Gilbert advanced to the third round 
with a 6-1, 7-5 decision over Eliot Teltscher.

SCHAUB UP ONE NOTCH TO A TITLE 
</P>

<P>
Robert Schaub of San Marcos, who rides for Celo Pacific, used last year's 
second-place finish as a motivator and claimed his first U.S. title Tuesday in 
the 45-49 time trials at the Masters National Cycling Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Schaub was clocked in 53 minutes 33 seconds for the 40 kilometers. Although it 
wasn't as fast as his 53:30 in the Finish Line 40K in Bakerfield earlier this 
year, he said he was pleased, considering the wind conditions and competition. 
</P>
<P>
Teruel De Campo of Englewood, Colo., placed second in 56:07. 
</P>
<P>
Following last year's finish, Schaub's motivation increased, and consequently, 
his training mileage increased as well. During non-racing weeks, Schaub rides 
300 miles in the hills of Fallbrook and on and around Palomar Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
His experience on hills helped him on the course of just under 25 miles, from 
the Tijuana toll gate to the Rosarito exit and back. Two weeks ago, Schaub 
said, he traveled to Tijuana, rode the course and graphed it out to know where 
the inclines, hills and curves were. 
</P>
<P>
"I always go as hard as I can to the turn-around, then use my hill strength on 
the way back," Schaub said. "It's usually into the wind, like today. I like 
rolling courses like this. I excel where there's rolling terrain on the return. 
I rode about 32-35 miles an hour going out and 25-28 coming back because of the 
head winds." 
</P>
<P>
After getting to the starting line late, Norm Hoffman of Bakersfield made up 
for lost time and won the 50-54 division in 55:23. He was 2:30 ahead of Ralph 
Myatt of El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tickled to death to win this," Hoffman said. "They were running about 
two minutes early, and I went into the bathroom and (a friend) came in and told 
me I was up. I came running out of the bathroom, and when I went, I was in the 
wrong gears. It gave me such a shot of adrenaline, I just really hammered it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman holds the world record of 51:49 in the men's 45-49 time trial, set in 
1987 in Moriarty, N.M., only a few months after he began competing. Each 
September, record attempts are made on the same course, and Hoffman plans to 
try for the mark in the men's 50-54 age group at that time. 
</P>
<P>
These accomplishments are pretty amazing coming from someone who just nine 
years ago was told he might not walk again. Hoffman was hit by a car while 
riding a dirt bike and broke his right leg in eight places, his left leg in two 
places and his left arm in two places. 
</P>
<P>
"My (right) leg was shattered like a bag of mush. My doctor was able put the 
eight pieces together," Hoffman said. "At first, they thought I'd lose the leg. 
Then they weren't sure I'd walk again. I had to learn how to walk all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman began riding as a form of rehabilitation and soon found he excelled as 
a cyclist. After winning local races, Hoffman was urged by friends to compete 
in district races. After winning at that level, he tried nationals. This is his 
third national title since beginning racing three years ago.

RILEY'S WORK CUT OUT BECAUSE OF WILLIAMS' 67 
</P>

<P>
Carlsbad's Travis Williams shot a 67 Tuesday in the opening round of boys' 
15-17 competition at the Optimist Junior World Championships at Torrey Pines 
South. Which means San Diego's Chris Riley is already nine strokes behind where 
people expect him to be -- in first. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 16, most people do not yet have to worry about living up to a 
reputation -- especially on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
But Riley does. And he has had to do so for quite a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he won the 11-12-year-old age division of the Junior Worlds four 
years ago, he was just living up to family standards. 
</P>
<P>
See, Riley's father, Michael, is considered the first "really great" junior 
golfer, according to Norrie West, who was one of the three founders of the 
Junior World, which began its 23rd run at four area courses. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Michael Riley was the junior player of the year five years in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Chris also has a brother, Kevin, who as a freshman last year was the No. 1 
golfer at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Well, since winning the 11-12 division in '86, Riley has learned that his 
lineage can be difficult to follow. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Riley suddenly found himself atop a pedestal -- and he was only 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of too young to really know what was going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What was going on was this: Riley was quickly compared to his father. He was 
compared to his brother. And even now -- according to Ralph Trembley, a local 
golf promoter who has been monitoring the junior scene for a couple of decades 
-- Riley is considered, along with two-time NCAA champion Phil Mickelson, the 
top prospect to emerge from San Diego in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some pedestal. The company's good, but everyone's always trying to knock you 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like he's just playing against one other golfer," West said. "He has 
to go against the entire field. There can be 20 golfers out there capable of 
knocking him down, and one of them is going to come up and get him." 
</P>
<P>
At the San Diego Section individual championships two months ago, three seniors 
couldn't topple Riley, then a sophomore. Riley won the event on the last hole 
by sinking a 20-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
Easy stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But that was just a county championship. Now Riley is after another world 
title. To get it, he'll have to rely on more than his putting, the strongest 
part of his game. 
</P>
<P>
Now he must be equally strong in getting to the green. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, however was anything but during his first nine holes of the opening 
round. He made the turn (after starting on the ninth tee) with a five-over-par 
41. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't concentrating," Riley said. "I was slacking off . . . just 
looking around instead of concentrating on my game." 
</P>
<P>
But the back nine was easier. He finished one under at 35 for a total of 76. 
</P>
<P>
"On the back nine," Riley said, "I decided to bear down, and I started playing 
good. Now I feel good about going into (today's) second round." 
</P>
<P>
Though he made up ground over the final nine holes, Riley found himself nine 
strokes behind Williams, one of the three seniors Riley narrowly beat out in 
the section championships. Williams, 17, who graduated from San Dieguito in 
June, birdied five holes and parred the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"I just played a flawless round," he said. "I didn't make any stupid mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Notah Begay III, 17, Albuquerque, N.M., was one stroke behind.

NHL PLAYER O'CONNELL SET TO COACH IHL TEAM 
</P>

<P>
Mike O'Connell, a 12-year NHL defenseman, is expected to sign a one-year 
contract today to coach San Diego's International Hockey League franchise after 
being released from the remaining year on his contract with the Detroit Red 
Wings. 
</P>
<P>
Don Waddell, director of hockey operations for the unnamed San Diego Hockey 
Corp. team, said Tuesday that the clubs have reached a financial agreement on 
O'Connell and that he plans to introduce O'Connell, 34, at a press conference 
today at the San Diego Sports Arena. Jim Devellano, Detroit's senior vice 
president and former general manager, confirmed that it's almost a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing took about one minute," said Devellano from Lake Placid, N.Y. 
"I knew (Waddell) needed a coach. Mike was coming to the end as a player, and 
it was an opportunity for him to continue on with the game. We didn't want to 
stand in the way." 
</P>
<P>
Waddell had narrowed his coaching choices to O'Connell, who has no coaching 
experience, and Bob Hoffmeyer, a former coach in the New Jersey Devils 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell played in Chicago and Boston before spending the last four years in 
Detroit. He interviewed late Saturday in San Diego, and Waddell offered him the 
job Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was leaning toward him," Waddell said. "I decided who I felt was the No. 1 
guy, and I wouldn't fly the other one out." 
</P>
<P>
Waddell said he was impressed by O'Connell's work ethic and perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
"He came highly recommended by numerous personnel in the NHL," Waddell said. 
"He's a hard-nose, blue-collar worker. No one expected him to play even one 
season. He's 5-feet-9. For defense, that's small, but he uses his smarts. You 
don't play 12 years in the NHL if you're dumb." 
</P>
<P>
Neither team would say how much it cost to settle the remaining year on 
O'Connell's player contract. Waddell said the average salary in the NHL is 
$200,000 and that a player of O'Connell's level would probably command at least 
that much. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in a position to buy out his whole contract, but the difference of a 
few thousand isn't going to keep me from hiring him," Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
It may be a good deal more than that. Waddell said he had originally budgeted 
approximately $50,000 for his coach, but the IHL team will have to absorb part 
of his player contract and also compensate the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting up there," Waddell said. "It's more than I had planned." 
</P>
<P>
Said Devellano: "I don't want to get into dollars, but there was an 
accommodation made between San Diego's and Detroit's hockey clubs." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell was in San Diego looking at homes but was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The search for a name for the team has been narrowed to three -- the Gulls, 
Sharks or Breakers -- and they have been submitted to an artist for logo 
considerations.

CHARGERS SIGN THIRD-ROUND PICK GOEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers have agreed to terms with two more draft choices, including 
third-round selection Leo Goeas, an offensive tackle from Hawaii, General 
Manager Bobby Beathard said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Goeas, 6-feet-4 and 285 pounds, was the second of three Charger picks in the 
third round and the last to come to terms. 
</P>
<P>
Goeas, an All-Western Athletic Conference selection, was the 60th player taken 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Also agreeing to terms was cornerback Ken Berry, a 10th-round choice from 
Miami. Berry, 6-2 and 185, had 43 tackles and four interceptions as a senior. 
He was the 256th player selected overall. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard declined to provide details of the agreements. But Goeas' agent, Mark 
Bartelstein of Chicago, said Goeas has agreed to a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also announced they have signed free-agent wide receiver Troy 
Johnson and released two others. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 27, has 41 catches for 777 yards and two touchdowns with in four 
seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Steelers and Detroit Lions. He 
was had two catches for 29 yards last season before he was cut by the Lions 
after the ninth game. 
</P>
<P>
Released were Bobby Bankston, who was on Tampa Bay's developmental squad last 
season as a rookie out of East Texas State, and Steve Shelley, a rookie from 
Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
The moves leave the Chargers with 92 players on their roster. That includes 10 
veterans and eight draft choices who have not agreed to terms. Training camp at 
UC San Diego opens Friday for rookies and selected veterans. CURT HOLBREICH

<P>
Poland declared itself "entirely satisfied" Tuesday with firm new border 
guarantees, removing the last major obstacle to German reunification by the end 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski said he accepted assurances that 
a unified German state will sign a border agreement with Poland as soon as 
possible after reunification, which is expected to come Dec. 2 with all-German 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's agreement affirmed the present frontiers of Poland and Germany, and 
German representatives relinquished all German claims to territory that was 
incorporated into Poland after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Skubiszewski added that West Germany agreed to begin "economic talks" with 
Poland shortly. 
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate, but he and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher insisted that Bonn had not bought Polish acquiescence with a promise 
of assistance for Warsaw's troubled economy. 
</P>
<P>
"As regards to the border between Germany and Poland, the two German states and 
Poland are equally satisfied," Skubiszewski told a news conference following a 
session of the so-called two-plus-four talks on German unification. Poland was 
added to the usual six-nation conference for the border discussions. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the foreign ministers of East and West Germany and the four 
victorious World War II powers -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain 
and France -- agreed in principle on the contents of a "final settlement" that 
would formally end the war and terminate all Allied occupation rights. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts from the six nations were directed to prepare a draft agreement 
in time for the foreign ministers to approve it at Sept. 12 meeting in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
If accepted by the foreign ministers, the draft would be ratified by a meeting 
of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe tentatively 
set for Nov. 19 in Paris. That would provide the symbolic stamp of approval by 
European states not represented in the two-plus-four process. 
</P>
<P>
"The lion's share of the substantive decisions are done," a senior U.S. 
official said. "The devil is in the details." 
</P>
<P>
He said the drafting process could turn up new disagreements. But that appears 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
cleared the way for the accord Monday when they agreed on a formula that will 
permit a unified Germany to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. Moscow previously had objected to German membership in the 
alliance, which was established as a military counterweight to the Soviet Union 
and its Warsaw Pact alliance. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference following the two-plus-four session, a reporter bluntly 
asked the West German and Soviet foreign ministers how much money Bonn had 
agreed to provide to Moscow as the price for the Gorbachev-Kohl accord. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not appropriate to talk of a price to buy Soviet agreement," Genscher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze added: "There is no trade, and 
we're not going to trade." 
</P>
<P>
However, a West German government official in Bonn indicated that economic aid 
was closely linked to the political settlements. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very much interested in helping our eastern neighbors succeed in 
economic reforms -- otherwise, political reforms won't survive," said the 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, a triumphant Kohl told reporters that all major obstacles to German 
unification had been swept aside and that the way is clear for the two Germanys 
to hold combined elections in December. 
</P>
<P>
"The practical problems which lay before us on the way to German unity have 
been solved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was left out of the final negotiations on NATO membership. 
And U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III was virtually ignored during the 
news conference, which focused on details of West Germany's agreements with the 
Soviet Union and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials attributed Moscow's change of heart to painstaking work by 
President Bush and by Baker, who repeatedly pressed the issue during two 
Bush-Gorbachev summits and dozens of other high-level meetings. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said that the U.S.-Soviet dialogue is no 
longer a sterile ritual in which each side recites its position without paying 
much attention to the other. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now much more give and take," the official said. "Can you frame 
discussions in a way that serves their interest as well as ours?" 
</P>
<P>
In substance, the border agreement that Poland's Skubiszewski accepted Tuesday 
seems similar to assurances that Warsaw previously had branded as inadequate. 
However, the Polish official said East and West Germany agreed to rhetorical 
changes in the two-plus-four text that calmed Polish fears. 
</P>
<P>
Although Skubiszewski declined to elaborate, U.S. officials said the key 
elements were: 
</P>
<P>
Agreement by East and West Germany that a united German government will 
negotiate and sign a border treaty "as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
A declaration that Germany has no territorial ambitions toward any other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement by West Germany that, after unification, a provision of the West 
German constitution allowing other German states to join the Federal Republic 
will be eliminated. The article was intended to facilitate the unification of 
West and East Germany, but Poland was concerned that it could be used as a 
pretext to annex Polish territory that once was part of Germany. Areas such as 
Silesia and Pomerania are still home to many ethnic Germans. 
</P>
<P>
A statement that West German laws that declare the border to be provisional 
pending a World War II peace treaty will no longer be considered valid. 
(Negotiators at the two-plus-four talks agreed earlier to draft a "final 
settlement" instead of a "peace treaty" because a formal treaty was not 
considered necessary 45 years after the end of the war.) 
</P>

Firm endorsement by the two-plus-four powers of the present German-Polish 
border along the Oder and Neisse rivers. That line was drawn in 1945, in part 
to compensate Poland for areas in the east that it lost to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Poles had demanded that a border treaty be signed before the four wartime 
Allies give up their rights in Germany, but they compromised on what amounts to 
a "solemn promise" that their borders will be guaranteed by a pact after 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn official said West Germany understands Poland's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"The Poles have had a very bad experience with a strong Germany," the official 
said. "It is very understandable that the issue of the border creates a lot of 
uncertainty and fear, because Poland in the past has been invaded and divided 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have proved over the past 40 years that we are firmly democratic with 
no expansionist goals." 
</P>
<P>
Skubiszewski said: "In my view, Germany has changed quite a lot. There are 
extremist movements, but they are fringe groups and quite small."

<P>
As an American Airlines 727 thundered above this subdivision six miles from 
Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Joyce Jordan looked toward the heavens 
and prayed for silence. "Why should we be subjected to this?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
The noise wasn't this bad when Jordan and her husband, Dewitt, bought their 
home. When Raleigh-Durham became a hub in 1987, takeoff and landing patterns 
changed dramatically. Airliners now routinely roar over the tree-lined 
neighborhood of $200,000-to-$500,000 houses, and "For Sale" signs dot the 
avenues. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordans would be selling as well, but "we aren't sure we could get our 
money back," Joyce Jordan says. "I wish we had known this before -- we wouldn't 
have bought here," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordans and many of their neighbors are barred from selling by the 
economics of the housing market, but they aren't willing to give up. They have 
banded together to press local elected officials for restrictions on noise 
levels in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The town of Cary -- that's the body I want most to recognize this problem," 
Jordan says. "They're the ones who zoned this for residential uses in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
All over the nation, jet blast-plagued homeowners are organizing vocal 
campaigns to squelch, or at least dampen, the racket. And they are making 
enough noise to make the airline industry take notice. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of aircraft noise is a problem that we can no longer ignore," Ronald 
W. Allen, chairman and chief executive of Delta Air Lines Inc., Atlanta, said 
in a recent speech. "Local noise restrictions are rapidly becoming a principal 
impediment to increasing airport and airway capacity." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the two sides aren't on entirely different courses. Nearly everyone 
involved in aviation agrees that aircraft noise must be stifled. The debate 
centers on two issues -- how best to muffle the racket and who should pay for 
doing it. 
</P>
<P>
The major air carriers want the federal government to set noise standards for 
the 400 U.S. airports that receive regular commercial service. But the Bush 
Administration has been reluctant to go ahead with any such move, lest it open 
the way to thousands of lawsuits from disgruntled property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, with no nationwide policy to guide them, airports are setting 
up a patchwork of regulations that vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' Department of Airports is calling for highly restrictive limits on 
aircraft noise. Under a plan drafted by Los Angeles International Airport 
officials and awaiting public hearings, airlines using the LAX and Ontario 
airports would have to limit their use of current-generation aircraft and phase 
them out entirely by Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
Other regional airports in Southern California already strongly discourage the 
use of the noisier, older planes at their fields. In 1987, the 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport became the first in the nation to serve only 
the newest, super-quiet generation of planes. 
</P>
<P>
"We got in line early and made the move before the federal government got so 
upset on this issue," said Victor Gill of the Burbank airport. "We didn't ask 
the federal government's approval." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Southland Regulations 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, John Wayne in Orange County and San Diego's Lindbergh Field have 
noise abatement policies limiting the number of flights, passenger volumes or 
carrier operating hours. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Department officials are not happy with the current situation. 
In the wake of the Los Angeles proposal, U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel 
K. Skinner warned that Washington "cannot allow airports across the country to 
adopt (noise standards) willy-nilly. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen a proliferation of rules and regulations by local airport 
authorities all over the country, many of which are not consistent with each 
other and which are a very inhibiting factor on aviation traffic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles move, however, has spurred the federal government to act. 
Partly to preempt the LAX ordinance, and to dissuade other airports from 
establishing noise rules of their own, Skinner now says he is considering a 
nationwide noise-abatement policy. Agency officials, however, concede that the 
timetable for that plan is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Clifton Moore, executive director of LAX, said he is tired of Washington's 
high-flying promises to impose a noise-abatement policy. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to study this thing and keep on studying this thing for as long as 
possible," he said. "The federal government ought to be able to take a 
position. If there were a national position (on noise-abatement), we would 
follow it. It's the lack of a national policy that's causing the problem." 
</P>
<P>
That problem isn't an easy one to resolve. Current regulations classify 
commercial jetliners in three separate groupings, based on the noise they make 
taking off and landing. 
</P>
<P>
The noisiest are the obsolete "Stage 1" planes -- second-generation jetliners 
such as Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s, which have been banned from most 
airports and haven't been built in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat quieter are the slightly aging "Stage 2" aircraft -- Boeing 727s, 737s 
and 747s. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are the ultra-quiet "Stage 3" planes -- the newer 737s, 747s, 
757s and 767s, Lockheed L-1011s and European Airbuses. 
</P>
<P>
Moore estimates that about 40% of the planes flying through LAX and Ontario 
International Airport are Stage 2 aircraft, a factor that leaves him 
incredulous that Washington would object to his barring the noisy planes. 
</P>
<P>
"They're saying to us: 'Don't you do anything to protect your citizens, and we 
won't take a position because we might get sued,' " Moore says. "We just have a 
completely different point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Delta chief Allen agrees. While not necessarily endorsing the specifics of the 
LAX proposals, Allen contends that Washington must take charge of the noise 
issue or chaos will result. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we deal with it at the national level, our system will become strangled 
through non-uniform, uncoordinated and highly restrictive local rules," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Allen recently scolded the Administration for failing to include noise 
abatement in its priorities for a new national transportation policy. He calls 
it "the most glaring omission in the Administration's policy statement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Factors 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the dilemma over noise abatement are some analysts' fears that too 
harsh a set of restrictions might cripple some airlines at a time when many 
carriers are already financially strapped. 
</P>
<P>
Buying a new plane these days costs up to $45 million, well beyond the budget 
of many ailing carriers. Wealthy airlines such as American, Delta and United 
have placed large orders for the new planes and would have less trouble meeting 
noise-reduction plans. Their weaker sisters, notably Pan Am and Eastern, can 
barely afford to keep their fleets of Stage 2 planes flying. Buying quieter 
planes for them would be financially impossible, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're an airline and you're not taking acquisition of new aircraft, then 
you're in trouble (if the federal government phases out Stage 2 planes)," said 
one airline executive who asked not to be named. "I've got to fly profitably 
these Stage 2 aircraft I've already got, otherwise I can't afford to buy any 
Stage 3 planes. I'm not flying profitably now, so how can I consider buying any 
new planes? I've got a vicious circle going here, and new regulations aren't 
going to help me at all." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, local business leaders and government officials are wary that 
severe federal regulations might hurt their ability to attract hub-and-spoke 
operations to their airports. Such operations, spawned by deregulation of the 
air transit system, bring new jobs and revenues to airport communities. 
</P>
<P>
At the Raleigh-Durham airport, expanded operations have been an economic tonic 
to the region, generating 21,800 jobs and $645.2 million in revenues. As 
American Airlines' north-south hub, the two-runway field became America's 
32nd-busiest terminal in 1989, based on number of passengers, boardings and 
departures, up from 37th in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Airport directors would oppose the FAA telling them what you will and won't do 
as an airport director," said Charles Barkley, executive director of the 
American Assn. of Airport Directors, a Washington-based trade association. 
"Airports are owned and operated by local governments . . . (and) local 
government should make most of the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley dismisses any suggestion that the need to preserve local authority 
should provide an argument for keeping Washington out of the noise-abatement 
process, however. 
</P>
<P>
"An airport is like any other major industry -- its needs and the community's 
needs must be balanced by environmental concerns and economic concerns," he 
said. "There are federal interests involved as well." 
</P>
<P>
To stave off federal intervention, Raleigh-Durham officials enacted a 
noise-abatement program last May, and it drew virtually no opposition from 
Washington.

WILSON USES QUOTA ISSUE IN NEW TV AD ATTACKING FEINSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gubernatorial campaign squabble over appointing women and minorities to 
government jobs -- and whether that constitutes a quota system -- spills onto 
California's airwaves today when Republican Pete Wilson accuses Democrat Dianne 
Feinstein in a television commercial of planning to put "quotas over 
qualifications" if she is elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
The new 30-second ad hammering on an area where Republicans hope Feinstein will 
be vulnerable was expected to be aired on some small stations Tuesday night, 
and will expand to television markets across the state by today. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who is in Washington while the U.S. Senate is in session, had no direct 
comment on the ad, but his campaign spokesman accused Feinstein of "pandering" 
to voting groups by promising to appoint women and minorities in proportion to 
their share of the state's population. 
</P>
<P>
"She made those promises to get more votes," said Bill Livingstone, Wilson's 
spokesman. " . . . Other women would find it very distasteful to have been 
given a job (because of) a quota system." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's campaign immediately accused Wilson of "distorting the issue." 
</P>
<P>
"She voted against quotas when she was mayor," said Feinstein's spokeswoman, 
Dee Dee Myers, citing her 1980 opposition to a San Francisco City Charter 
revision that contained appointment quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein also could not be reached for comment. She traveled Tuesday to 
Washington, where she has scheduled a series of fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
In her absence, Feinstein's campaign staff also accused Wilson of doing 
precisely what he accuses the former San Francisco mayor of doing -- supporting 
proportional representation of women and minorities in government. 
</P>
<P>
They circulated copies of an affirmative action plan used in San Diego during 
Wilson's tenure as mayor. The program's objective, as set out in city 
documents, was to "make city employment . . . consistent with the minority 
composition of the city of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Livingstone said that plan, even though its objective is almost exactly that 
espoused by Feinstein, was not a quota system. "That is a goal, not something 
that would happen immediately," he said of the San Diego plan. "Wilson didn't 
go to black groups and promise them 7% of the jobs." 
</P>
<P>
The candidates have been bickering for weeks over whether Feinstein's pledge 
represents a quota system or is more akin to traditional affirmative action 
programs, which emphasize goals and objectives over specific numbers. 
</P>
<P>
At the root of the dispute is each candidate's desire to appeal to diverse 
segments of the voting public -- and particularly to women, who constitute more 
than half of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson ad, notably, is being launched at the same time that Republicans 
statewide begin to emphasize the role of women and the party's opposition to 
quotas. At the state GOP convention this week in Wilson's hometown of San 
Diego, prominent Republican women such as Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole are 
expected to blast quota systems as demeaning. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was first raised in the closing days of the primary campaign, when 
Feinstein explained how she would handle appointments at all levels of 
government, from her office staff to judges and department heads. 
</P>
<P>
"Fairness is part of the dream," she told black audiences in Los Angeles on 
Memorial Day weekend. "That is one of the reasons we have pledged an open and 
accessible administration. That is one of the reasons we have pledged to 
appoint women in proportion to their parity of the population -- 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"To appoint people of color in proportion to their parity of the population. To 
see that the administration is open. . . . That is the agenda." 
</P>
<P>
When the proposal came under fire from Wilson late last month, Feinstein said 
she did not consider her proposal to be a quota system, which she defined as 
one excluding certain groups of people. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Wilson has never known a quota. I know what a quota is," she said. Her 
campaign staff later said Feinstein was referring to her exclusion from private 
school as a youngster. The exclusion occurred because Feinstein is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, in previous public comments, has suggested that by promising a certain 
proportion of jobs to certain groups, Feinstein was de-emphasizing the 
individual merits of job-seekers. His campaign ad underscores that sentiment, 
asking in its punch line whether California can "afford a governor who puts 
quotas over qualifications and promises over performance." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson aides refused to disclose how much they intend to spend on the 
advertisement, except to describe the cost as substantial. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy represents a calculated gamble. Summer is generally thought to be 
a season in which voters are not paying attention. But Wilson is apparently 
hoping that he can do what Democrat Edmund G. Brown Jr. did in 1978 against 
Republican Evelle Younger -- hit his opponent early and hard. Brown won that 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate in recent months launched a commercial that delivered a lead 
in the polls that held until Election Day. That was Feinstein, who won the 
primary largely on the strength of a February commercial touting her leadership 
in the aftermath of the assassination of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone.

STATE ORDERED TO RELEASE MEDI-CAL FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: STALEMATE IN LEGISLATURE MAY BE NEARING AN END. DEMOCRATS APPEAR READY

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Tuesday ordered the state to release $330 million to 
hospitals and nursing homes by Monday, a development that came as Assembly 
Democrats appeared ready to make concessions they hoped would end the crisis 
that has left California floundering without a budget for more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ronald B. Robie of the Sacramento County Superior Court, acting on a 
request by a group of nursing home operators, issued the temporary restraining 
order to free $330 million for 1,200 hospitals and 1,468 nursing homes. Many of 
the facilities rely heavily on Medi-Cal funds and have not been paid since July 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis, who is prevented by law from paying state bills until a 
budget is approved, applauded the judge's decision. But he warned that if the 
courts continue to order the release of funds and the state makes an 
$850-million payment to school districts this month, as scheduled, the treasury 
will be "bone dry" by July 27. Last week, a federal judge ordered the state to 
provide payments of $149 million to nearly 2 million welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Democrats said in interviews that they are prepared as a last resort 
to send Gov. George Deukmejian a plan to close the $3.6-billion budget gap 
entirely with cuts in programs. Until Tuesday, the Democrats had been insisting 
that any solution include equal doses of budget cuts and tax and fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said, "You can hold out, but at some point, 
holding out with no end in sight and no hope for compromise ends up hurting the 
very people we are trying to help." 
</P>
<P>
Two Assembly-Senate conference committees meeting Tuesday night approved the 
Democratic plan, setting the stage for an Assembly floor vote on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The package includes more than $1.3 billion in new revenues and $1.6 billion in 
budget cuts, but the two sides of the equation are not linked. 
</P>
<P>
One leading Republican, Assemblyman Willam P. Baker of Danville, denounced the 
package as a "political charade." He predicted his fellow Republicans would 
reject the plan because it would force the governor to cut too deeply into 
programs Republicans value, such as prisons and universities, and spare such 
Democrat-supported services as health and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
The developments came as the state faced an ever-deepening cash crunch because 
of the budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that once the $850-million payment is made to schools July 27, 
"there will be absolutely no money left to make any substantial payments at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Davis has been taking the side of welfare recipients, nursing home operators 
and others whose state payments have been held up even though he is named as a 
defendant in the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic officeholder appeared at a news conference with several 
minimum-wage "in-home support workers" who have not been paid since mid-June 
for their services to the sick and elderly who otherwise would have to go into 
costly nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the court action requiring the state to make payments to welfare 
recipients and hospitals, Davis is still holding up about $870 million in other 
payments, including $270 million in Medi-Cal money for doctors, dentists and 
pharmacies and an additional $21 million to providers of in-home support 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Lara, 33, of Sacramento, who cares for her chronically ill 66-year-old 
father under the In-Home Supportive Services program, burst into tears at 
Davis' news conference. "I have no money. I have an eviction notice. I have to 
be out of my home Aug. 10. My car is ready to be repossessed," she said, 
sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere around the state similar stories were being told. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran out of food around the 10th (of July) and the bills have kept coming 
in," said Rita Blue, a Riverside County resident who depends on a 
$1,000-per-month check from the state to support herself and her mother, who 
has Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know how bad things are? Today I sold blood so I could buy 
something to eat," she said, adding that she received $15 from a blood bank. 
</P>
<P>
For James Weatherby and his wife, Lynne, of Riverside, the payment holdup has 
meant going without meals so two other family members have enough nourishment 
to offset the effects of medication they take for epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Weatherby provides in-home care for her 13-year-old son, Ted, who is also 
blind and epileptic, and his brother, Rick. Her monthly checks of $648, coupled 
with a small disability check James Weatherby receives because he is blind, are 
what the family live on. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going through a lot of hurt," said James Weatherby, 35, estimating the 
family income since July 10 at $5. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, many home-care workers from among about 40,000 have not 
been paid since June 10, according to Ophelia McFadden, general manager of the 
Los Angeles Homecare Workers Union Local 434B of Service Employees 
International Union. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the union "delivered food to some who didn't even have gas or bus 
fare. . . . One woman called and broke down and cried and said I have nothing 
in my house for my children (to eat). We are trying to provide food baskets." 
</P>
<P>
Lolly Birlin, a Ventura County woman who cares for her severely disabled 
daughter, said that after buying groceries and gasoline Tuesday morning she was 
down to her last $1.78. "I'm just waiting. I don't know what else to do," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also hard hit is Bette Bendorf, a single mother who provides home care to a 
number of clients in Orange County. She said that she has been unable to pay 
her rent because she has missed two paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to have to take care of those clients who absolutely need the care 
and others are going to have to do without for a while." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Ernestine Aviles, who cares for a 90-year-old woman, said that 
she will be able to survive the budget crunch because of her husband's 
earnings. But many of other people who live in her apartment complex won't be 
so lucky, she said. "There are homemakers in this building who are having to 
force themselves to leave their patients because there is no paycheck coming 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald M. Kurtz, executive director of the California Assn. of Health 
Facilities, the group that filed the suit to free up the Medi-Cal funds, said 
Judge Robie's decision "means the money will be released in time for nursing 
homes to meet their next payroll." Kurtz said that most nursing homes have 
already missed two payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
"Nursing home employees have been getting paid by borrowing to the hilt. We're 
against the wall. A significant number of our facilities are on the brink of 
bankruptcy."

REAGAN MEETS NIXON, SAYS REAPPRAISAL IS WARRANTED

Former President Ronald Reagan, emerging from an hourlong meeting Tuesday with 
Richard M. Nixon, said much of the criticism leveled at the former chief 
executive "was based on nothing at all" and urged historians to re-evaluate 
Nixon's place in history.

In 1974 Nixon, with his top aides under indictment and his Administration badly 
battered, became the only President ever to resign the office. But Reagan said 
Tuesday that Nixon's achievements far outweighed his failings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think much of the criticism was based on nothing at all," Reagan said in a 
brief interview. "I think that looking at it fairly, they (historians) should 
view some of the great strides that he made in international relations and so 
forth with our country." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's remarks came on the first day of Nixon's trip to Southern California, 
a visit that began without fanfare Tuesday but will peak later this week when 
dignitaries gather to dedicate the former President's library 16 years after he 
gave up his office in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, limping slightly, left the meeting at Reagan's Century City office at 
3:01 p.m., saying only "it's a nice day here" as aides escorted him into a 
waiting car. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither former leader would discuss the meeting in detail, an aide who 
attended the session described it as a cordial mixture of small talk, shared 
recollections and discussion of world events. 
</P>
<P>
"It was two very well-respected Presidents and world leaders chewing the fat 
over what is going on in the world," said the aide, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
After discussing the first time they met -- Reagan, then the president of the 
Screen Actors' Guild, was testifying before the House Un-American Activities 
Committee in 1947 when Nixon was a junior congressman -- the two shared 
opinions on the state of affairs in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the 
aide said. The former presidents agreed they should strongly support President 
Bush as he carries out his own policies. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, according to the aide, was especially forceful in stressing the 
importance of former presidents lending their support to the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon and his wife, Pat, also visited the Reagans at their Bel-Air home Tuesday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tuesday's meetings took place out of public view, they kicked off 
three days in which Nixon will briefly hold a share of national attention 
again, culminating in the dedication Thursday of the Richard M. Nixon Library 
and Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Curious visitors descended on the library Tuesday, drawn by the mounting 
publicity and directed there by newly erected signs in and around the city. At 
the site, they encountered legions of workers putting the finishing touches on 
the facility while Secret Service agents milled about checking security 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the library's installations remained uncompleted. One, entitled 
"Legacy," will review Nixon's retirement, Hewitt said. The other, "Watergate," 
details the scandal that sent Nixon's top aides to jail and eventually drove 
the President from office. 
</P>
<P>
Many Yorba Linda residents basked Tuesday in the publicity the library has 
brought their city of 51,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, when I would say I was from Yorba Linda, people would say: 'Where?' " 
said Barbara Buschini, 48. "Now when I say Yorba Linda, they say: 'Oh.' We're 
on the map now." 
</P>
<P>
At neighborhood shops, storekeepers sold T-shirts of Nixon flanked by former 
Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Reagan, as well President Bush, all of whom will 
attend the dedication.

A fresh group of Cubans sought political asylum at other foreign embassies in 
Havana on Tuesday only hours after a weeklong standoff at the Czechoslovak 
Embassy ended with the surrender of 12 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Four young Cubans climbed onto the roof of the Italian ambassador's residence 
Tuesday and asked for political asylum, an Italian Embassy spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Cuban police seized and dragged away a Cuban who tried to enter the 
U.S. Interests Section. The section protested to Cuban authorities about the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, a family of four Cubans pushed their way into the 
consular section of the Spanish Embassy and demanded visas, diplomatic sources 
said, but they were persuaded to leave and apply for their visas normally. The 
couple and two children already had valid Cuban passports and authorization to 
leave the country. Three Cubans are being sheltered at the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The new incidents came a day after 12 Cuban refugees surrendered 
unconditionally and left the Czechoslovak Embassy after fighting among 
themselves and holding five Czechoslovak diplomats hostage for more than five 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Five Cubans are occupying the house of a Czechoslovak diplomat but have been 
refused diplomatic protection.

TRANSIT BRIEFING; 
</P>
<P>
$11 BILLION IN FEDERAL AID BEING SOUGHT FOR MASS TRANSPORTATION 
</P>

<P>
As car-crazed Southern Californians turned out in surprising numbers this week 
to launch their light rail Blue Line, a new transit lobby was hard at work here 
trying to vastly increase funding for the nation's mass transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
For millions of Americans, bus lines, commuter rail lines, trolleys and, in 
several areas, elevated trains and subways have long worked in concert and 
independently, linking cities and suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDS SOUGHT: America's Coalition for Transit Now, an umbrella group of about 
50 organizations and corporations, hopes to pressure Congress into approving a 
nearly fourfold increase to $11 billion in federal spending for mass transit 
programs during next year's reauthorization of the Surface Transportation 
Assistance Act. 
</P>
<P>
Under existing programs, the Urban Mass Transit Authority, which operates under 
the Department of Transportation, administers about $3.2 billion annually for 
mass transit needs across the nation (working from this capital city, which has 
a modern and efficient subway system). The nearly fourfold increase sought by 
the coalition appears extremely ambitious given the soaring federal deficit and 
the prospect of significant budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Fried, executive director of Transit Now, said the coalition arrived at 
its $11-billion target by figuring that it would take an additional $3.5 
billion to restore inflation-adjusted funding for mass transit to the 1980 
level, $1.5 billion to bring the mass transit industry into compliance with new 
statutory regulations and about $3 billion more to correct the unattended 
problems associated with mass transit over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, where some residents remember the Big Red Car trolley that 
stopped running in the area three decades ago, the 22-mile, $871-million Blue 
Line links downtown with Long Beach at $1.10 a ride. It's the first leg in an 
ambitious $5-billion, 150-mile rail system that will include the 17-mile Metro 
Rail subway from Union Station to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
MASSIVE SYSTEM: New York remains mass transit's king of the hill, with a subway 
system that traverses four boroughs, both underground and on elevated tracks, 
and carries 3.7 million fares a day at $1.15 each. There are 6,200 subway cars, 
468 subway or elevated stations and 720 miles of tracks. The trains have an 
on-time rate of 87%, according to the City Transit Authority. The borough of 
Staten Island is not linked by subway but is served by a public ferry -- 50 
cents a round trip -- and private ferries. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, New York has 3,800 public buses that also charge $1.15. (Los 
Angeles has 2,700, and the basic fare is $1.10 for one zone.) Various rail 
lines haul commuters from suburban points, like Long Island, Connecticut and 
New Jersey, into New York City. The busiest of these lines is the Long Island 
Railroad, which delivers 110,000 commuters to Pennsylvania Station every 
working morning from as far as 120 miles away and claims an on-time record of 
90.6%. Fares range from $4.25 to $14, depending on distance traveled, and 
monthly discount tickets are available. 
</P>
<P>
FARES VARY: Some of the nation's transit systems have flat fares, and others 
tie their charges to distances traveled. One of the more unusual fare 
variations is found in the state of Washington, where the Seattle metropolitan 
area fronts Puget Sound and a ferry system carries 20 million passengers a 
year. Ferry fares vary dramatically, from $1.10 to $31.25. 
</P>
<P>
The trip from Anacondas, Wash., to Sidney in British Columbia is $31.25 for an 
auto and rider (35 nautical miles). 
</P>
<P>
But, if you're touring Atlanta, it costs only 85 cents to ride the spanking new 
1840s-style red trolley buses that ply bustling Peachtree Street. 
</P>
<P>
Another relative newcomer to the transit scene is Miami's Peoplemover, an 
elevated light rail system that has operated since 1986. Conversely, in Boston, 
the almost ancient Green Line subway rolls over rails that were first laid in 
1897. 
</P>
<P>
But no bus system features a better deal than Portland's City Center lines. 
They cover 300 square blocks. And they're free. 
</P>

Stanley in Atlanta, Lianne Hart in Houston, Tracy Shryer in Chicago, Ann Rovin 
in Denver, Anna Virtue in Miami and Doug Conner in Los Angeles.

MANY IN CONGRESS LACK CHALLENGE;

THE NUMBER OF UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS IS GROWING. THE BELIEF IS THAT SEATED

<P>
From coast to coast, congressional elections are increasingly becoming a game 
of solitaire. 
</P>
<P>
Already, 75 U.S. representatives are guaranteed no major party opposition in 
this fall's election. By the time filing deadlines in all the states close, 
that number could reach into the mid-80s, up from 47 a decade ago. Likewise, 
four senators have drawn no major party challenger. 
</P>
<P>
VOTERS STYMIED: In a year when disenchantment over the savings and loan scandal 
and deadlock over the budget have produced glimmers of resentment against 
incumbents, that means voters will have no chance to register their feelings 
for perhaps nearly one-fifth of the House members and about one-eighth of the 
senators on the ballot this year. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very, very few challengers, and yet the atmosphere is such that you 
can take some of these guys out," lamented Charles E. Cook, the publisher of a 
political newsletter in Washington. "As a result, what could be an 
anti-incumbent year is likely to be so only in isolated circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Like the boll weevil, uncontested races once were a uniquely Southern blight, 
as Republicans routinely chose the better part of valor against entrenched 
Democratic incumbents. But the pattern has spread. Eight of New York's 
representatives are unopposed in the general election. So are five of 11 in 
Massachusetts, six in Pennsylvania, five in Illinois, three in Wisconsin and 
two each in California and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Free passes are still a mainstay of Southern politics -- but now on a 
bipartisan basis. 
</P>
<P>
In Virginia, for example, Republicans failed to find challengers for any of the 
five Democratic House members seeking reelection. But the Democrats could not 
produce a candidate to oppose Republican Sen. John W. Warner. Republicans found 
no one willing to step up against powerful Democratic Sens. Sam Nunn in Georgia 
and David Pryor in Arkansas; but Democrats were unable to recruit an opponent 
for Republican Sen. Thad Cochran in Mississippi -- a state that did not elect 
its first Republican senator in this century until 1978. 
</P>
<P>
In both Texas and Florida, five Republican representatives are running 
unopposed -- as are 10 Democrats in the two states. 
</P>
<P>
WHY IT'S HAPPENING: Experts cite several reasons for the growing number of 
races without even token opposition: 
</P>
<P>
The conventional wisdom that it is virtually impossible to unseat an unindicted 
incumbent with a steady pulse. "These people are being told . . . you cannot 
win, so they don't run," Cook said. "This all becomes terribly 
self-fulfilling." 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of campaigning. In Virginia, former Rep. Joseph L. Fisher 
seriously considered running against Warner but backed away when he decided he 
could not raise enough money to topple an incumbent. "I doubted I could get 
enough money together to have a good chance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The imminence of congressional redistricting. "You are seeing a lot of 
(potential) challengers say 1990 is not the best year to run," said Howard 
Schloss, communications director at the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee. "People don't want to run in a district that is going to disappear 
in two years." 
</P>
<P>
The expectation that a large number of incumbents may step down in 1992, the 
last year, under campaign reform laws, in which retiring members with enough 
seniority may convert to personal use any campaign surpluses they have 
accumulated. 
</P>
<P>
The growing tendency of local party leaders to discourage challengers from 
stirring secure incumbents who, if faced with opposition, might unleash media 
and field operations that could benefit all the candidates on their ticket. 
</P>
<P>
LARGER IMPLICATIONS: Many analysts consider the rise in uncontested races only 
the most tangible symbol of a larger problem: the stunning decline in 
competitive congressional races. In the last election, not only were 98.5% of 
all House members reelected, but more than 88% of them were sent back to 
Washington with over 60% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
This year, analysts estimate that as few as two dozen House members could face 
serious competition. "It's bizarre," said Thomas E. Mann, director of 
government studies at the Brookings Institution. "The fact is every state in 
the union ought to be competitive."

<P>
The cold rain mixed with her hot tears as Milinda Reyes stood with a bullhorn 
and cried again and again Tuesday for her 5-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Michelle, can you hear me?" the 30-year-old woman sobbed. "Michelle, please 
get a rock and tap it against the wall so we can find you. Michelle, please. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
There was no sound from the giant heap of crumpled concrete and twisted steel 
that was the 12-story Hyatt Terraces Hotel and Convention Center until it 
collapsed in a devastating earthquake here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Baguio, a graceful town of winding roads and hillside villas, suffered the 
worst damage from the magnitude 7.7 quake that rolled across central Luzon 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
Army Gen. Juanito Aquias estimated that 40% of Baguio was damaged. At least 21 
hotels, churches, schools, banks and office buildings collapsed, and hundreds 
of others were damaged. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of residents are feared 
dead in the rubble and in nearby gold mines. 
</P>
<P>
Officials put the confirmed death toll nationwide at 279. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people in Baguio spent their second night Tuesday sleeping in open 
fields, in cars and buses or in tents across the town. Even the injured slept 
outdoors, despite the drenching rain, for fear that the city's three hospital 
buildings would collapse in one of the almost hourly aftershocks rocking the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ernesto Bayuga, head of the Notre Dame de Lourdes Hospital, said he could 
not estimate the number of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't counted them yet," he said, standing in the pouring rain surrounded 
by dozens of beds. "They keep coming." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the refugees cried and prayed as the huge, empty Baguio Hillside Hotel 
crashed down with a roar following a particularly sharp aftershock at 3 a.m. 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Another aftershock, measured at a magnitude 6.3 by an observatory in Hong Kong, 
hit the city at 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got no water, no light, no phones and no way out," said Nora Servania, 
an insurance agent who spent her second night sleeping outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
Landslides blocked all roads to the city, and heavy thunderstorms Tuesday 
prevented most helicopters from flying in. Like many roads and buildings, the 
airport runway is badly cracked. As a result, rescue operations had barely 
begun by early today, 36 hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Military cadets searched for survivors in the Nevada Hotel, and rescuers were 
able to talk to 18 people trapped in a room inside. But officials said they 
fear more than 100 others died when the five-story luxury hotel twisted on its 
axis, split in two and collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the U.S. Agency for International Development was pulled dead 
from the wreckage, a U.S. Embassy official said here. The victim's identity was 
not released. 
</P>
<P>
An explosion and fire sent a thick plume of black smoke skyward Tuesday 
afternoon from the Baguio Export Processing Zone, where a two-story building 
housing four factories had collapsed. About 650 people were working when the 
quake hit, and the number of survivors was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people are inside," said Rodolfo F. Alborte, whose freight-forwarding 
company was also affected. "So many people are dead." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. helicopters had airlifted 31 people out to hospitals by mid-afternoon, and 
embassy and military officials began inspecting the damage. At the U.S.-run 
Camp John Hay, the U.S. Embassy and Voice of America buildings were badly 
damaged. One embassy official predicted that the final death toll here would be 
enormous. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, there's 3,000 people working in the mines here," he said. "We have 
no idea what happened to them." 
</P>
<P>
College buildings on at least three campuses collapsed. At the 10-story 
University of Baguio commerce building, students jumped screaming from windows 
as the structure began to shake and floors collapsed. Police said 60 students 
may be crushed inside. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning, I counted 22 dead," said Mark Oliver, 17, a student. "The bodies 
were lined up for their families to claim them." 
</P>
<P>
Another student, Von Agbayani, 20, was on the seventh floor when it plunged as 
the fifth and sixth sandwiched beneath him. He finally escaped down the fire 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was crying and screaming," he said later. "I could see many people 
were killed." 
</P>
<P>
No rescue work was visible at the nine-story Baguio Park Hotel. The building 
folded like an accordion, showering huge chunks of concrete on cars and trucks 
below. At least three other hotels in the downtown area also collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
When the bottom two stories of the Royal Inn collapsed, however, windows on the 
top two floors amazingly were left unbroken. A wall fell away from another 
building, leaving bedrooms and bathrooms exposed as in a dollhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The most pathetic and heroic tales were at the Hyatt Terraces Hotel, however. A 
12-story wing used mainly for offices and apartments collapsed quickly, and a 
seven-story adjoining section of hotel rooms fell in an aftershock about 45 
minutes later, survivors said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant manager Helen Rotor said at least 57 guests and 23 employees are 
missing. Another 150 are believed trapped in the casino, she said. Only nine 
bodies had been recovered by Tuesday afternoon. Among them was the wife of the 
hotel manager, Heinrich Mauldecker, who stood by the wreckage, grimly 
supervising the rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
David Semmerson, 35, a vacationing New Zealander, was in a Shakey's Pizza when 
the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
"A building fell down next to me," he said. "I ran past the university, and 
that was in pieces. I thought my family was dead." 
</P>
<P>
When he reached the Hyatt, he said, "people were tying sheets together. My wife 
and two kids were on the top floor. I couldn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers climbed up the knotted sheets and blankets, tied his 3-month-old and 
3-year-old boys to their backs and ferried them down. His wife followed. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty minutes later, there was a big aftershock," Semmerson said quietly. 
"And the whole thing came tumbling down." 
</P>
<P>
Jan Westrich, her husband, Greg, and their 1 1/2-year-old and 5-year-old sons, 
a Chicago family visiting from Hong Kong, escaped from a sixth-floor room after 
the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
"We ended up going out through the window," Jan Westrich said. "We climbed 
across two balconies. Then they had the rope. Two Filipino men tied the 
children with sheets to their backs and carried them down." 
</P>
<P>
An aftershock rocked the ground as she spoke, huddled with her sons under a 
grass-thatched hut on the hotel grounds. The cold rain poured down. 
</P>
<P>
"How come it's all moving again?" asked Brian, 5. 
</P>
<P>
"Honey, it's just an aftershock," she said soothingly. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the guests watched in grim silence as Milinda Reyes called for her 
daughter in the wreckage nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been hearing her cry," the distraught mother explained. "At 1 
o'clock I called her and she answered. Maybe she's just tired. Maybe she's just 
sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Reyes picked up the bullhorn and again began her plaintive cry 
toward the rubble. "Michelle, can you hear me? Michelle? Please?" 
</P>
<P>

ANTI-CASTRO TERRORIST BOSCH LEAVES PRISON; 
</P>
<P>
CUBA: SOME REVERE THE EXILE AS A PATRIOT WHILE OTHERS SEE HIM AS A VESTIGE OF

<P>
The old anti-Castro terrorist is finally free, paroled Tuesday from a U.S. 
prison into the capital of the Cuban exile community, into a Miami where many 
consider him a revered patriot -- and others deem him a pitiable fool. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Bosch, a 63-year-old man with a bad heart and ulcers, emerged through 
the gates with a look of determination, like one of those ghosts in the movies 
who has suddenly materialized after years in the void. 
</P>
<P>
He has been jailed for most of the past two decades, here and in Venezuela. And 
he returns to a city very different from the one he fled in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Commando tactics have long since given way to sophisticated political lobbying. 
Most here think the Castro government is in massive decay -- soon to crumble 
not from outside attack but from its own unsteady weight. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Bosch says he now believes this, too. A condition of his release is a 
disavowal of violence. "Dr. Bosch reaffirms . . . that he has renounced 
terrorism in any form whatsoever as a means of political action. . . . " Hank 
Adorno, his attorney, said. 
</P>
<P>
There are other conditions -- something close to house arrest. He must wear an 
electronic ankle bracelet to monitor his whereabouts. He can go outdoors only 
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. He cannot speak with anti-Castro militants. His phone 
will be tapped. He must submit to lie detector tests. 
</P>
<P>
"You may reach the conclusion that Orlando Bosch is going to lead the life of a 
coward or a hermit . . . but, no!" he said at an evening press conference, 
vowing to spend his three hours a day of liberty out on the streets speaking 
out for his cause. "(The U.S. government) may have purchased a chain, but they 
don't have a monkey." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the restrictions, he considers them better than confinement in the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center southwest of Miami, where he has been held for 
the past 26 months as a parole violator. 
</P>
<P>
And better than deportation, which is what the U.S. government would prefer. 
Officials say they have asked 31 nations on six continents to accept the 
one-time pediatrician. No takers. 
</P>
<P>
So he comes back to Miami, where he is seen variously as a hero, a relic or, by 
the Justice Department's reckoning, a longtime terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
Secret FBI and CIA files implicate him in numerous bombings, the department 
said last year as it denied the Cuban-born Bosch political asylum. Remember, 
officials cautioned, that this is a man once arrested for towing a torpedo 
through downtown during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
But where some see peril -- others only find a purity of purpose. "Bosch's 
appeal is his principles, not his tactics," says prominent Miami attorney 
Rafael Penalver. "This is 1990, and the whole Cuban community condemns 
terrorism; it's a non-issue." 
</P>
<P>
To understand the importance of Bosch is to recall 31 regretful years of exile. 
Some 577,000 people here are of Cuban birth or descent -- and the great 
unhealed wound of their lives is communism in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, with Castro still new to power, many refugees became 
weekend commandos, attacking Cuba's shores with CIA support. But the raids 
often turned into embarrassing failures, and the White House lost interest in 
its Cuban, anti-communist militia. Men such as Orlando Bosch became something 
akin to obsolete artillery. 
</P>
<P>
He was not prepared to be idled. In 1968, he shot off a jerry-built bazooka at 
a Polish freighter in the Miami harbor. The attack did little to harm the 
vessel, but it did cost Bosch a 10-year term in federal prison. He was paroled 
after four years. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many others, he then could have made his concessions to exile -- earned 
a good living, bought a nice home, saved his strident exhortations for annual 
reunions. 
</P>
<P>
But Bosch preferred a life of intrigue to a career in medicine. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, he fled rather than face a subpoena in a murder case. He wandered 
through Latin America, an eager conspirator in anti-communist plots. In 1976, 
he was charged in Venezuela with masterminding the bombing of a Cuban jetliner, 
in which 73 people died. Though he was acquitted three times, he was never 
freed -- nor forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
His prolonged jailing sparked protests and hunger strikes here. Then the prison 
doors suddenly opened. In 1988, Bosch boarded a plane to Miami, where his wife 
and children had remained. 
</P>
<P>
There he stood at the airport -- a long-gone parole violator with no visa, a 
hot potato for a White House that very much covets the political support of 
conservative and wealthy Cuban-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Delegation after delegation to Washington wanted to know: When will Bosch be 
freed? Attorneys pursued the matter. The federal judge assigned the case 
wondered aloud whether the government intended to hold Bosch indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
In February, soon after governments tumbled in Eastern Europe, nearly half of 
Cubans polled here said they thought Castro would be gone within the year. Talk 
of a free Cuba has become as strong a stimulant in Miami as good espresso. The 
urgent debate is how to hasten events: Would it be prudent to finally begin a 
dialogue with Castro -- or is that idea still unspeakable? 
</P>
<P>
Where exactly will Orlando Bosch fit in with all this avid, if possibly 
premature, planning? It is hard to say. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many leaders with their own groups; it's not likely anyone would 
say, OK Bosch, now you tell us what to do," said Clark, the sociologist.

Six soldiers who disappeared from a classified intelligence unit in West 
Germany and are believed to be members of a mysterious group called "The End of 
the World" have been caught in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The five men and one woman, apprehended over the weekend in this Panhandle 
city, were being held at Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Benning, Ga., pending a counterintelligence investigation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bob Hall, a spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, said that the 
investigation is being conducted as a matter of routine because the soldiers 
had access to classified information. 
</P>
<P>
"The Army says this does not appear to be an espionage case," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Joe Padilla, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, said he had no information 
about "The End of the World" group except that the six are apparently members. 
He could not say if it has any significance in the investigation, or how and 
when the Army came to know of their affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
All six soldiers were Army intelligence specialists assigned to the 701st 
Military Intelligence Brigade at Augsburg, West Germany, Padilla said. He would 
not say what jobs they performed but he said that their training was in 
analyzing foreign communications. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has not filed charges against the six soldiers, Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
He said an absent-without-authorization allegation could encompass either 
absent without leave or the more serious charge of desertion. 
</P>
<P>
Hall and Padilla said that they did not know how the six got to Florida from 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
They were caught after one of the men was stopped by a police officer Friday 
night because the taillights on the van he was driving were not working, 
authorities said.

The driver of the truck that hit a school bus in Texas last fall, sending it 
into a water-filled pit and killing 21 students, should have been able to stop 
despite faulty brakes, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The small number of emergency exits -- only two -- contributed to the deaths, 
the board said. NTSB Chairman James Kolstad said driver Ruben Perez "did not 
respond soon enough and he did not respond aggressively enough."

REV. CLIFTON MOORE; RELIGIOUS RADIO-TV PIONEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Clifton E. Moore, who started a unique radio ministry in Los Angeles 
in 1948, one since copied by hundreds of other clergymen across America, has 
died in Irvine at 81. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a Presbyterian minister and former chairman of radio and TV for the 
Southern California Council of Churches and for the Los Angeles Church 
Federation, died Saturday at his home in the Orange County city. 
</P>
<P>
He was a successful parish minister in Ohio before deciding to become a radio 
specialist, and he came to Los Angeles with a family and no job -- just a 
revolutionary idea. 
</P>
<P>
He had tinkered with radio broadcasting before deciding on a full-time ministry 
over the airwaves, a plan that was to eventually result in nominations for many 
of of radio and television's top awards. 
</P>
<P>
He attended the National Broadcasting Co.'s institute in Los Angeles and, after 
graduating, approached Dr. Louis H. Evans Sr., pastor of Hollywood Presbyterian 
Church, one of the nation's largest, about a Christmas broadcast. The resulting 
program featured James Stewart, Dennis Morgan, Virginia Mayo and other 
prominent Hollywood figures and so impressed Evans that he made Moore his first 
minister of radio and television, a position he held for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Moore eventually became director of radio and television for the Synod of 
Southern California for the United Presbyterian Church and then executive 
director of the Commission on Radio-Television-Films for the Council of 
Churches of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, he was named executive director for the Religious 
Radio-Television-Film Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
His longest-running and most-celebrated TV programs included "Give Us This 
Day," "Faith of Our Children" (which won six local Emmy awards) and "Great 
Churches of the Golden West" (which featured 500 churches over 13 years and 
received a special Governor's Award Emmy). 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, the year before he retired, Moore produced 65 programs on Channel 2, 
52 on Channel 4, 26 on Channel 7 and 52 each on Channels 11 and 13, along with 
countless radio spots. 
</P>
<P>
Moore mused about his career in an interview on the eve of retirement, saying 
that "my greatest success was not so much what I did, but that a warm body got 
into the ecumenical field in this way. . . . I was the bell cow that kind of 
set a pattern for it." 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service for Moore, who did his graduate work at Princeton Theological 
Seminary, Western Reserve University in Cleveland and UCLA, will be held at 11 
a.m. Thursday at Pacific View Chapel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his daughter, Gloria Rothschild, a sister, a brother and five 
grandchildren.

TRADE DEFICIT RISES TO $7.7 BILLION AS OIL IMPORTS JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite continuing expansion of U.S. exports, the nation's trade deficit jumped 
to $7.7 billion in May from $7.3 billion the previous month, primarily because 
of a surge in oil imports, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts indicated that the increase in the deficit was a temporary 
setback in an otherwise improved trade picture. They noted that overall the 
growth of exports is outpacing the growth of imports. At the current rate, the 
trade deficit this year will be about $98 billion, compared to $109 billion 
last year and $119 billion the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In another trade matter, the Senate on Tuesday passed a textile import quota 
bill by a 68-32 margin -- two votes more than the minimum that would be needed 
to override a threatened presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would limit the increase in imports of textiles and apparel to 1% a 
year and would freeze imports of non-rubber shoes at 1989 levels. It runs the 
risk of being deemed in violation of international trade obligations under the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is facing crucial multinational 
negotiations later this year. 
</P>
<P>
A counterpart bill is stalled in the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and 
Means Committee, where the leadership has expressed reluctance to approve trade 
quota legislation designed to protect a specific industry. 
</P>
<P>
A similar bill was passed by both houses in 1988 but was vetoed by President 
Ronald Reagan. Observers predict that the measure is unlikely to pass in the 
House and -- even if it does -- is even less likely to survive a veto. 
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit figures announced by the Commerce Department were interpreted 
by many analysts as a continuing reason for some optimism from the U.S. 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
David Wyss of DRI/McGraw-Hill, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass., noted 
that, for the year so far, "imports are down 1% from a year ago as domestic 
consumption slows in a softening economy, while exports are up 7% over the same 
period." 
</P>
<P>
Oil imports accounted for almost half of the increase in imports in May.

Coors (in a tie with Heineken) holds 20% of the Japanese import market, 5% of 
the market in Canada, 25% in Bermuda and 19% in the Virgin Islands, where the 
company introduced its product only eight months ago. The popularity of lighter 
beers in England and the evolving free-trade agreement between the United

AD SLUMP CONTINUES FOR MAGAZINES AS TV GRABS A BIGGER SHARE

The recession that gripped the magazine industry earlier this year showed 
little sign of easing in the second quarter, according to figures released 
Tuesday by the industry's leading trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Total advertising pages, off 3.5% in the first quarter from the year-earlier 
period, slid 3.3% for the first six months of 1990, the Magazine Publishers of 
America said. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are derived from a survey of 173 member magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The continued weakness was a disappointment for industry officials who have 
predicted that the slump would be no more than a brief interruption in growth. 
</P>
<P>
The two categories of advertising that were most to blame for the weakness 
showed no improvement in the second quarter. Tobacco advertising, off 25% in 
dollar value for the first quarter, was off 27% for the first half. Auto 
industry advertising, down 7.4% for the first three months, was off 12.5% for 
the first six months. 
</P>
<P>
Magazine analysts said that in a year of generally flat advertising budgets, 
many major advertisers have been apportioning more to television, to keep up 
with cable's expansion and the increase in network TV rates. 
</P>
<P>
"To keep pace on the TV side, advertisers don't have as much to spend on 
magazines," said David Lehmkuhl, an independent magazine consultant in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Among the top 10 revenue-producing magazines, the ad page comparisons for the 
six-month period were: 
</P>
<P>

FIRMS SAY JAPANESE DUMPING COMPUTER SCREENS; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH TECH: THE FORMAL COMPLAINT COULD LEAD THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT TO IMPOSE 
PENALTY TARIFFS OF UP TO 318%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A group of American manufacturers on Tuesday filed an anti-dumping complaint 
against 12 of Japan's largest electronics makers, alleging that they are 
selling advanced computer screens in the United States at below cost to drive 
out their American competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, filed with the U.S. Commerce Department, is the first 
anti-dumping action involving Japanese high technology products in recent 
years. Nonetheless, it underscores the continuing frustration of many U.S. 
electronics companies as they attempt to compete with larger, better financed 
and often more far-sighted Japanese rivals. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed by the Advanced Display Manufacturers of America, a 
group of seven small makers of computer screens. If the complaint is upheld by 
U.S. authorities, the offending Japanese products could be subject to penalty 
tariffs of 71% to 318% over their current U.S. prices, an action that would 
certainly drive up the cost of laptop and other personal computers using those 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are a variety of advanced computer screens -- generically known as 
flat-panel displays -- that are becoming increasingly important as personal 
computers become smaller and more portable. While flat-panel screens account 
for less than 10% of the total computer screens currently sold -- bulky cathode 
ray tubes have the remainder -- as many as 50% of all PCs will have these 
advanced screens within the next five years, according to some estimates. 
</P>
<P>
And the likelihood is that the screens will be made in Japan. Japanese 
manufacturers currently account for about 90% of the flat-panel display market, 
according to industry representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Flat-panel display technology traces its roots to research conducted in the 
1960s and 1970s at the David Sarnoff Research Center, once a part of RCA, and 
at Westinghouse. However, as with other key advanced technologies already lost 
to foreign competitors, the U.S. companies failed to cash in commercially on 
their inventions immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese didn't steal our markets. This is our fault," said one industry 
consultant. "We didn't pursue this technology until now, when we realized, 
after the Japanese showed us, how important it is." 
</P>
<P>
According to Paul Rosenthal, the Washington attorney representing the U.S. 
industry group, Japanese flat-panel makers are pricing their products for as 
little as one-third their actual cost, or anywhere from 10% to 66% below their 
U.S. competitors. The result, he said, was about $164 million worth of business 
lost by U.S. flat-panel makers. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the complaint were Fujitsu, Hoshiden Electronics, Kyocera, NEC, 
Matsushita Electronics, Optrex, Seiko Epson, Seiko Instruments &amp; 
Electronics, Sharp, Toshiba, Hitachi and Matsushita Electrical Industrial. 
</P>
<P>
Companies joining in the complaint are Planar Systems, Plasmaco, Ovonic Imaging 
Systems, Cherry Corp., Electro-Plasma, Photonics Technology and Magnascreen. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. regulators have 11 to 14 months to complete their review of the complaint 
and make a final determination. 
</P>
<P>
However, an initial ruling could come in less than six months.

MADONNA GETS THE BOOT AGAIN, THIS TIME FROM REEBOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Reebok has stopped holding its breath for "Breathless" Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
The rock star, who plays the sensual Breathless Mahoney in the film "Dick 
Tracy," was dropped late Tuesday as a spokeswoman for the athletic shoe maker 
even before filming a single commercial. Reebok and Madonna, 31, had previously 
agreed to -- but not signed -- a contract that would reportedly have paid her 
nearly $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna's availability and our need to get her weren't a mesh," said 
Bernadette Mansur, Reebok's vice president of marketing communications. "We 
needed to get some benefits out of it to continue with the deal." 
</P>
<P>
For Madonna, who is currently on a world tour that has received mixed reviews, 
the Reebok action must bring feelings of deja vu. Last year, Pepsi signed a 
$5-million endorsement contract with Madonna but aired her spot only once 
before yanking it from the U.S. market. The commercial was being confused by 
some consumers with her "Like a Prayer" music video that featured religious 
imagery that some found offensive. Pepsi later pulled out from sponsoring 
Madonna's planned U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, suits and countersuits have been filed between Nike and 
Madonna. Representatives for Madonna claim the singer and Nike had signed a 
$4.25-million endorsement contract for which she was never paid. And in May, 
her song "Hanky Panky" was banned from some radio stations that received 
objections to lyrics like these: "Some guys like to sweet talk and others like 
to tease. Tie my hands behind my back and ooh, I'm in ecstasy." 
</P>
<P>
Madonna, her manager and publicist were all out of the country and unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A Pepsi spokesman declined to comment on the company's short-lived experiment 
with Madonna. But spokesman Tod MacKenzie said, "Any time you get involved with 
a personality of that stature, there's always the risk of the unknown." 
</P>
<P>
One consultant who matches celebrities with sponsors said she is not surprised 
by the latest snafu between Madonna and Reebok. "Between her films, her 
concerts and her love affairs, I'm sure there would be a problem with most 
advertisers," said Noreen Jenney, president of Woodland Hills-based Celebrity 
Endorsement Network. "It takes a very special advertiser to take these kinds of 
risks."

Agency Wants to Lower Asbestos Limits: The Labor Department's Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration has proposed halving the average number of 
fibers allowable in the air to 0.1 per cubic centimeter. The agency reduced the 
level from 2.0 to 0.2 in 1986. The latest proposal would require reports by 
owners of buildings where asbestos is disturbed, as well as special provisions 
for handling asbestos used in such services as auto brake and clutch repair.

Payments by Van Nuys Firm, GE Ordered: A jury directed General Electric Co. to 
pay $70.8 million to American Aviation Industries Inc. of Van Nuys for 
breaching a contract between the two, American Aviation said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury, however, also ordered American Aviation to pay $9.8 million to GE and 
its General Electric Capital Corp. finance subsidiary. The money is mostly to 
repay loans from General Electric Capital to American Aviation, the company 
said. The lawsuits stem from a venture under which American Aviation and GE 
were to retrofit Lockheed JetStar corporate jets with GE-made CF34 turbofan 
engines.

Broad Bonds Classified as Nonperforming: The reclassification of $92 million in 
bonds in its investment portfolio in second quarter 1990 showed up in a report 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time the Los Angeles financial services company has had to 
make such a classification. Jana Greer, a spokeswoman, said Broad had set aside 
$22 million to cover permanent losses. She added that the company expected the 
bonds to recover the $70 million in value not covered by the reserve fund and 
that the temporary loss would not have a material impact on Broad's 
$7.1-billion investment portfolio.

U.S. Deal Making Abroad Falls: Japanese, Swedish, Swiss and other foreign 
corporations have stepped up their global mergers and acquisitions activity, 
while American firms' deal making abroad has dropped off, the New York 
consulting firm KPMG Peat Marwick reported. American companies in the first 
half of 1990 made acquisitions valued at $8.1 billion, down from $11.4 billion 
in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, foreign purchases of U.S. companies rose to 
$27.9 billion from $23.9 billion.

Drug Companies: Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s second-quarter net income rose 26% to 
$274 million. Sales were $1.23 billion, an increase of 24%. 
</P>
<P>
The Indianapolis-based company attributed the growth to increased sales in 
international and domestic markets and a strong performance by its medical 
instruments division. Pfizer Inc. said second-quarter net income rose 11% to 
$151.2 million on a revenue increase of 15% to $1.5 billion. The company noted 
gains in its health-care (26%) and specialty chemicals (4%) units, but said 
animal health-care product sales were flat, consumer product sales declined 2% 
and specialty minerals sales were off 20%. Upjohn Co. said its second-quarter 
earnings from continuing operations jumped 21% to $114 million. Sales rose 11% 
to $804.7 million. The Kalamazoo, Mich.-based firm attributed its performance 
to a significant pension credit, strong sales and cost-control measures.

NO SURE BET IN MAIL SWEEPSTAKES

<P>
The familiar pitch goes something like: Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson. 
Today may be the day you'll remember for the rest of your life. . . . The day 
you received your lucky $1-million winning number. 
</P>
<P>
 American consumers receive direct-mail sweepstakes promotions almost daily. 
The largest prize offerings come from industry giants such as Reader's Digest, 
Publishers Clearing House and American Family Publishers Sweepstakes. Others 
pour in from smaller companies, marketing everything from condominiums to 
aluminum siding to various charitable causes. 
</P>
<P>
Do you really win something for nothing? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but . . . read the fine print. 
</P>
<P>
In the sweepstakes, the odds are astronomical -- an Anaheim grandmother who won 
the $5.2-million top prize in the most recent Reader's Digest sweepstakes in 
April beat odds of 1 in 150 million. (That compares, say, to the 14 million to 
1 odds of picking all six numbers in the California lottery.) 
</P>
<P>
Some companies tell the odds of their games; others do not. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think consumers are interested in the odds," said David Carlin, a New 
York lawyer who serves as spokesman for American Family Publishers, which has 
given out about $30 million in prizes to the public in 10 years. "It's the 
dream they're interested in." 
</P>
<P>
Most contests have a time cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
And most say you don't have to buy something to win a prize. That's because 
they cannot do so and continue to be legally classified as a sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
If the games do require a purchase, they'll run afoul of the law at some point. 
If, say, they require a merchandise buy or that you send a small sum, like $1, 
to be considered for a prize, they, then, legally are lotteries and cannot 
distribute materials through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
"A lottery requires three aspects -- consideration (purchase), chance and 
prize," said Herschel Elkins of the California attorney general's office. "As 
long as there is no consideration, then it is not (classified) as a lottery. 
But many of the charities are on very thin ice. They're clearly in violation 
when they say they are 'only selling 1,000 tickets at $100 apiece.' Some get 
out of it by saying that there is a recommended donation, however, you can pick 
up free tickets at a certain location." 
</P>
<P>
Elkins also blames some firms for deceptive promotions: "They'll say you are 
one of four people who can win, when actually the odds are not 1 of 4, but 1 in 
10 million. Those companies should be ashamed of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
As far as learning how many millions of direct-mail sweepstakes are sent out 
nationwide, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
The big firms guard mailing information like Ft. Knox; the field is so 
competitive they don't want anyone to know how many sweepstakes they mail out 
in a year. Even the U.S. Postal Service won't give out the numbers, a spokesman 
said, "because direct-mail sweepstakes are such a competitive market." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of business where if you know the numbers, you can figure out 
what the other guy is doing and try to copy them," Carlin explained. 
</P>
<P>
Companies mail sweepstakes by third-class or bulk postage, which can cost 
anywhere from 10.1 to 16.7 cents per piece, depending on the size, weight and 
sorting process. 
</P>
<P>
Reader's Digest in Pleasantville, N.Y., originated the direct-mail sweepstakes 
concept in 1962 and since has awarded almost $57 million to more than 1.7 
million Americans. Its international subsidiaries also conduct sweepstakes in 
many foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
Direct-mail sweepstakes are one of the fastest-growing types of consumer 
marketing, and they're popular with the public, according to Donnelly 
Marketing's most recent annual survey of promotions by consumer product 
companies. The number of sweepstakes entrants, the study showed, increased from 
57% in 1987 to 70% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Firms use sweepstakes as a cost-effective way to market products. What they 
give away in prizes, they get back in "high-volume sales," said George V. 
Grune, chairman and CEO of Reader's Digest. "That helps keep our costs -- and 
our prices -- lower." 
</P>
<P>
Are most magazine subscriptions cheaper when offered with sweepstakes? Almost 
always. 
</P>
<P>
Publishers Clearing of Long Island, N.Y., is so confident of its "unbeatable" 
rates offered in sweeps that it says it will pay subscribers "four times the 
difference in cash," if they can show the company "a better deal." 
</P>
<P>
David Sayer, a spokesman, said the company has "20-some mailings a year," but 
the largest is targeted for receipt in most homes in late December and early 
January; the next largest is the current, July mailing. 
</P>
<P>
The current jackpot is the largest in the firm's history, more than $22 million 
in prizes, including one $10-million prize and 12 $1-million winners. Like 
other big firms, Publishers Clearing also awards lesser prizes during the year. 
</P>
<P>
What about the warning notices in some sweepstakes promotions, telling 
consumers they may be dropped from lists if they don't buy soon? ("Order today! 
Don't be dropped from our list!") They may be valid. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to keep mailing to people who never buy -- it is tremendously 
expensive," insisted Carlin of American Family Publishers. "Every mail-order 
company does" drop some consumers from its lists eventually. Some firms do so 
without notice, Carlin said, adding that American Family Publishers gives 
consumers a warning. 
</P>
<P>
"Some take a shorter time, others longer because we use many overlapping 
lists," Carlin said. "It's possible you can remain on the list for a long time 
without ordering anything." 
</P>
<P>
Elkins believes this kind of tactic gives consumers the "impression that 
they'll get a chance in the future if they buy something in this one," he said. 
"Never, under any circumstances, should consumers pay any money for anything in 
expectation of a prize. And they should remember there is no free lunch, or 
even a free breakfast, in regard to free prizes. The cost of a stamp makes it a 
bad bet. But if they want to waste 25 cents, go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
SWEEPSTAKES TIPS 
</P>
<P>
* Be wary of phone callers saying you've won a sweepstakes prize. Most 
reputable firms notify winners by mail and do not ask them to appear in person 
-- or finance their trip -- to collect prizes. 
</P>
<P>
* Be suspicious if asked for money to claim prizes. Some swindlers claim that 
"taxes" on a prize -- usually merchandise -- must be paid before shipping. 
</P>
<P>
* Never give out credit card numbers to collect a prize or enter a sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
* Read sweepstakes rules carefully; be aware of deadlines, prize amounts and 
disqualifying conditions. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't hesitate to contact a company with sweepstakes questions. Reputable 
firms will provide information. 
</P>
<P>
* If you think you've been victimized, immediately call the state attorney 
general's office, the Better Business Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission or 
local consumer fraud bureau. The faster you do, the better the chance of 
catching the swindlers.

SCREEN STYLE: FASHION VICTIM TAKES A VOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
THE MOVIE: "Betsy's Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE: Molly Ringwald (Betsy) plays a betrothed fashion design student. Her 
father (Alan Alda), mother (Madeline Kahn), sister (Ally Sheedy) and fiance 
(Dylan Walsh) are stultifying characters who distract from the two best parts 
of the film -- the sartorially splendid, cartoon-gangster Tony Dee, played by 
Anthony La Paglia and Betsy's wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: Costume designer Mary Malin created Ringwald's wannabe designer 
wardrobe by cleaning out her own closet and jewelry stash. She asked for 
contributions from her staff and even used some of Ringwald's own clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The eclectic style does not work to Ringwald's advantage. She looks awkward in 
a '50s leopard fur toque with a short-sleeve red dress and red wrist-length 
gloves. Over-the-top fashion statements worked for Bernadette Peters in "Slaves 
of New York" but on Ringwald they look ridiculous, especially with a pillbox 
hat perched on her forehead, as if she were a carhop. The only clothes that she 
wears with any sort of conviction are the frilly dress for an opera scene and 
her wedding gown. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony La Paglia, on the other hand, doesn't have a bit of trouble wearing the 
double-breasted, washed silk suits with peak lapels that look like a mountain 
range across his chest, and ties that are so loud they're deafening. He wears 
this grotesque wardrobe with a Cary Grant-like panache. 
</P>
<P>
THE STORES: Malin swears Ringwald's wardrobe has no certain store lineage. It 
was begged, borrowed or uncovered in the back rooms and sale racks of 
department stores. The wedding dress goes through such a transformation, from 
traditional to funky neo-nuptial, Malin feels it would be cruel to name the 
original designer. Customizing yields a Marie Antoinette-style frock with a 
decollete bodice and a swagged overskirt with a multicolored, multitiered 
underskirt of lace ruffles. Malin confessed the actual transformation took 
weeks of stitching in the workroom. 
</P>
<P>
La Paglia's suits came from Italy and from designers Hugo Boss and Bill 
Kaiserman. To find these eye-popping pieces, Malin said, "Well, let's just say 
I did very well in the (San Fernando) Valley." 
</P>
<P>
THE PAYOFF: Ringwald's converted wedding dress (pictured), worn with a white 
top hat and mid-calf length white boots, is surprisingly appealing. The white 
satin top hat is an especially nice touch. GAILE ROBINSON

PASADENA HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF BRIDAL GOWNS STIRS MEMORIES, SPINS DREAMS OF 
HAPPILY EVER AFTER

In 1939, Evelyn Kyle carefully donned her wedding veil -- its crown fashioned 
from orange blossoms and her great-grandmother's handkerchief -- and walked 
down the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the 79-year-old woman took the fragile headpiece from the cedar chest 
where it had been for more than five decades and strolled down memory lane. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminded me of when we were young and in college, and of course, of our 
wedding day," said Kyle, who donated the veil to the Pasadena Historical 
Society for its summer exhibit: "And the Bride Wore . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit at Fenyes Mansion, where the Historical Society is based, is a 
collection of 12 wedding gowns worn by brides from 1856 through the 1960s. The 
gowns will be on display until the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle wasn't the only one to relive her wedding day. Several of the Historical 
Society's docents donated their wedding gowns to the exhibit as well. 
</P>
<P>
Cecilia Mathews, 86, was married in 1924, and her cream-colored dropped-waist 
dress typified the flapper era. "My mother made this dress for me," said 
Mathews as she eyed the lacework on the hemline. "She just looked in Vogue and 
picked this dress out." 
</P>
<P>
For Patricia Hammerle, finding the perfect wedding dress was not so easy. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1945, and fabric was scarce because of the war. So the Pennsylvania 
native combed through stores before finding the traditional, long white satin 
gown she ultimately wore. 
</P>
<P>
"I was delighted to find this," said the 70-year-old Hammerle, as she looked at 
her gown on the mannequin, and then showed off her wedding photograph: bride 
clutching orchids, groom in military garb. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, many couples gave up big wedding plans and instead married 
on weekend furloughs. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a blue wool suit," recalled Nadine Feldheim, who wed in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband had seven days off from the service," said Feldheim, of Covina, as 
she toured the bridal exhibit on a recent afternoon. "When people got their 
leaves, they came home and got married. There was no time to plan a big 
wedding." 
</P>
<P>
As if to make up for the shortages during the 1940s, wedding gowns of the 1950s 
were elegant and made from luxurious materials. Typically, these dresses 
featured tiny waistlines with skirts that billowed over crinoline petticoats or 
hoop skirts. The 1950s-style dress on display also illustrates the generous use 
of net and lace that was popular at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just gorgeous," said Lou Rodriguez, 22, as she examined each of the 
dresses. "My favorite is from the 1880s. The dresses from that era were very 
feminine, very beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
The gown Rodriguez admired most was an ivory wool serge, with a tight-fitting 
bodice held in place with bone stays and laced with a silk cord. It also had a 
three-foot train. "It might be a bit much for California," Rodriguez conceded, 
"but I definitely want to get married in a traditional dress." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the wedding gowns in the show -- including a plaid silk taffeta worn in 
1856, a bustle-style dress with puffed sleeves worn by a bride in 1869 and a 
brown silk gown worn by a Pasadena native in 1890 -- come from the museum's 
regular costume collection. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it would be fun to have a show with just wedding gowns," said Kim 
Has, one of the Historical Society's curators. Has said she donned a simple 
poncho as part of her ensemble when marrying outdoors in 1984 at Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a traditional wedding at all," she said. "Every once in a while 
I wonder if I missed out on something. I see these gowns, and I think it would 
have been nice to have a gown and to keep it for the memories." 
</P>
<P>
THE EXHIBIT 
</P>
<P>
"And the Bride Wore . . . ," an exhibit of bridal finery since the 1850s, will 
be on display at the Fenyes Mansion, 470 W. Walnut St., Pasadena, through July 
31. 
</P>
<P>
The gowns may be viewed on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays from 1 to 4 p.m. 
There is a $4 admission charge.

SAN DIMAS' OLDEST HOUSE IS SIMPLY A HOME TO OWNERS

<TEXT>
<P>
There are three wooden signs outside the unpretentious house on East 1st 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Two are homespun reminders that the Ratliffs -- Opal and Russell -- live there. 
</P>
<P>
The third announces that this five-room, gray wood Victorian is a small piece 
of Western history -- the city's oldest house. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Glauthier, curator of the San Dimas Historical Society, said wood for 
the home was cut from Northern California redwoods before the turn of the 
century. The logs were floated down the Pacific to San Pedro, then carted to a 
San Dimas planing mill by horse and buggy. 
</P>
<P>
The house was built in 1887 and 1888 for the land agent of the San Jose Rancho 
Co., E. M. Marshall, who lived there with his family. In 1894 it became the 
first home of Harry Walker, whose family was prominent in San Dimas society for 
generations. Walker's uncle's home -- a grand Victorian mansion around the 
corner from the East 1st Street house -- is now a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
When the Ratliffs bought the house in 1962 for $6,500, they converted a back 
porch into a second bathroom and lowered the living room's original 16-foot 
ceiling. As far as they know, those were the only major structural changes ever 
made to the house. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the home's historical designation, bestowed by the city in 1982, there 
is nothing snooty about the house or its owners. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliff grandchildren and great-grandchildren have been known to slide down the 
sloping cellar door in back of the house -- just like the one in Dorothy's 
Kansas home in "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
Around front, Kelly green steps lead to a porch dominated by an inviting 
cushioned swing. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent family reunion honoring the Ratliffs' 65th wedding anniversary, 
17 visitors bunked at the two-bedroom house, and seven more bedded down in a 
trailer parked on the back lawn for the occasion. At one point during the 
festivities, a clothes tree next to Opal Ratliff's living room recliner held 15 
baseball caps. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliff, 83, was born in Oklahoma and as a baby traveled with his family in a 
covered wagon to Missouri, where he grew up and where he met his wife. 
</P>
<P>
After the marriage, they settled in Shenandoah, Iowa, and had 10 children: 
Forrest, 64; Farrell, 61; Gerald, 59; Montell, 57; Bobby, 55; Patsy, 51, and 
two sets of twins -- Mary and Larry, 49, and Barbara and Betty, 44. There are 
also 56 grandchildren, 44 great-grandchildren and one 
great-great-granddaughter, totaling 113 immediate clan members. 
</P>
<P>
The Ratliffs came to San Dimas from Shenandoah in 1961 to stay with Bobby after 
Ratliff lost his $75-a-week job as a nurseryman. 
</P>
<P>
"I got fired for joining a union," he said. "We didn't have no union. So I got 
fired, and they blacklisted me. 
</P>
<P>
"We was so poor, we couldn't hardly stand it." 
</P>
<P>
Finding new employment was tough, but eventually he landed a job as a mill hand 
in a paper factory, and later worked as a custodian at Bonita High School in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Opal Ratliff, 79, took a job as cook in a rest home and later as dishwasher and 
cook in a coffee shop, so they were able to afford the house, where they reared 
their two youngest children. 
</P>
<P>
Both Ratliffs are retired, though Russell Ratliff restores saddles in the work 
shed behind the house for a little extra income. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the house, walls and furniture tops are almost solid with family photos. 
Some show sons Bobby and Forrest in Navy uniforms during World War II. Mixed in 
with dozens of baby pictures are shots of John F. Kennedy and Franklin D. 
Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
There are also snapshots of Tudy, Ratliff's dog, and Shokey, his 12-year-old 
mare, who is boarded at the San Dimas Equestrian Center. And framed near the 
front door is a composite print of baseball greats Pete Rose and Ty Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
The couple didn't know about the house's history when they moved in. Somebody 
mentioned it one day, and the news made them proud, Opal Ratliff said. But 
afterward, she added, "we never thought nothing too much about it." 
</P>
<P>
For the Ratliffs, the house's value seems to be measured more in present 
pleasures than distant past. 
</P>
<P>
"We've enjoyed this old house," Russell Ratliff said. "We've had good luck 
here. And we love San Dimas."

ALL-STAR GAME A HIT WITH VIEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

international news services and the nation's press.

<P>
Even with a major rain delay, the annual All-Star game finished just where CBS 
hoped it would when the network locked up the Major League Baseball contract 
last year: on top of the ratings as the most-watched program of the week. 
According to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co., the low-scoring 
game attracted viewers in about 17 million homes; even the pre-game show ranked 
seventh among the week's 84 prime-time programs. 
</P>
<P>
The strong performance helped move CBS to within one-tenth of a point of 
knocking off NBC in the network sweepstakes: NBC averaged a 9.8 rating for the 
week, compared to 9.7 for CBS and 9.1 for ABC (each point represents 921,000 
homes). NBC was bolstered by its Thursday night comedies and by a first-run 
movie made originally for Canadian TV, "Love and Hate: A Marriage Made in 
Hell," which placed sixth. The full list of ratings is on page 11. 
</P>
<P>
* CBS did not do so well with new entertainment series. "Prime Time Pets" 
placed 19th with its first telecast July 9, but when the show moved into its 
regular time slot Friday, it finished 60th. That was a drop of more than 4.4 
million homes. Another new CBS entry, "Northern Exposure," ranked 46th in its 
first time out.

INGLEWOOD RADIO STATION MOUNTS BILLBOARD BLAST AT GRAFFITI; 
</P>
<P>
OUTDOOR ADVERTISING: FROM HOLLYWOOD TO LONG BEACH, KACE-FM DEEJAYS URGE 'DON'T 
PLAY THAT MESS' ON 400 POSTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Some people alter billboards, bus shelter signs and bus benches with graffiti. 
But KACE-FM (103.9) is using the same forums to deliver an anti-graffiti 
message. 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood-based radio station, in an effort to draw attention to the city's 
graffiti menace, is bolstering its outdoor advertising campaign this week to 
spread the message that the community is sick and tired of spray paint and 
marking pens. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first week of June, when 400 billboards were posted from Hollywood to 
Long Beach, KACE morning deejay team Steve Woods and Sam Putney, wearing stern 
expressions and polo shirts, have been pointing at pedestrians and motorists 
underneath the message, "Graffiti: Don't Play That Mess!" 
</P>
<P>
Now that message is being underlined by adding 200 billboards, 150 bus shelter 
signs and 220 bus bench signs to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Although the urban-contemporary station's demographics are more in line with 
the vandals' parents than the vandals themselves, some graffiti experts say 
that the colorfully worded billboard is at least making a dent in the 
multi-million dollar problem, especially where the non-gang-aligned, 
thrill-seeking "taggers" are concerned. RTD transit police claim that taggers 
are responsible for "99.9%" of the $10 million of annual graffiti damage to RTD 
busses alone. 
</P>
<P>
According to KACE promotions director Valerie Williamson, 40, the program is 
targeted at the taggers, who are typically grammar school to high school age 
and from a variety of ethnic groups and income brackets. Whereas gang graffiti 
is designed to mark territory, taggers are spray-painting or writing their 
names in an effort to self-advertise to friends, other taggers and the public. 
</P>
<P>
Because buses act as moving billboards throughout the city, they are a favorite 
target of taggers, but the problem isn't limited to buses. "Maybe 40% to 45% of 
graffiti in Los Angeles is done by taggers," said Daniel Martinez, 36, who 
heads graffiti abatement for the L.A.-based Community Youth Gang Services 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mann, currently the station producer at KACE, initiated the anti-graffiti 
campaign in October when he held the title of promotions and creative services 
director. The station approached the RTD, which became co-sponsor, and enlisted 
the help of Continental Cablevision and the California Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Tatum, 32, vice president and general manager at the station, said that 
the cable company and the state agency each contributed $10,000 and KACE kicked 
in $4,000 for manufacturing the signs. The RTD helped neogtiate the donation of 
the billboard space from Metropolitan Outdoor Advertising -- which otherwise 
would have cost $60,000 a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 150 bus shelter signs -- which would run about $12,000 to $14,000 a month 
-- and the 220 bus bench signs -- $11,000 a month -- have been donated by 
Gannett and Coast United Advertising respectively. 150 bus shelter signs run 
about $12,000 to $14,000 a month, and the bus bench signs would cost $11,000 a 
month to rent. 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of the six-month campaign, Steve and Sam will be posted on 
about half a million dollars worth of donated space. 
</P>
<P>
KACE prides itself on being a community service station, and it has addressed 
the graffiti problem on the air in the past, but its .8 arbitron rating and 
target audience of 18- to 49-year-olds with an annual salary of $35,000 or more 
makes it seemingly difficult to reach the vandals. That's part of the reason 
KACE went to the signs in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to reach those people, younger people who might not listen to 
KACE but could still get our message when outdoors," said Ricky Tatum, 32, vice 
president and general manager at the station. "The reason we use outdoor 
advertising is to reach those people -- trying to spread the message as far and 
wide as possible." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the station's only billboard campaign -- KACE launched a 
100-billboard "Reclaim Your Community" campaign two weeks ago, co-sponsored by 
Nix Check Cashing, to support Community Youth Gang Services, and there are 
still some traces of the "Stop the Violence" billboards launched in conjuction 
with RCA last year -- but the anti-graffiti campaign is KACE's largest. 
</P>
<P>
It's also unique for KACE in that it uses its own disc jockeys to speak to kids 
about graffiti. Woods, 39, and Putney, 42, are perhaps less obvious role models 
than Linden King and Greg Townsend of the Los Angeles Raiders, who were 
featured in an earlier RTD anti-graffiti campaign, but they feel contact with 
the public allows them the same kind of forum that the Raiders have. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully we're a symbol in the community," Putney said. "We feel we're more 
in touch with the community than the Raiders. We physically go out to the 
community, so that's a point in our favor. We're out in the community at least 
once a week, meeting people. When we have open house at the station, a lot of 
kids want to meet Steve and Sam." 
</P>
<P>
According to some involved with graffiti cleanup, the campaign is a welcome one 
that will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"(The signs) help out," Martinez said. "It gives out a message -- rather than 
individual property owners telling kids not to do it, which makes them more 
defiant, a sign shows that the whole community is telling them not to do it. It 
shows that there is a wide concern." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need more programs like what KACE is doing," said Delphia Jones, 
37, director of Operation Clean Sweep, the graffiti abatement department of the 
city's Board of Public Works, which spends $2.7 million a year on graffiti 
cleanup. "My impression is that (the campaign) will deter some of the younger 
people that haven't started graffiti yet." 
</P>
<P>
Others, like California state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Inglewood), emphasize that 
the signs are only a small part of a larger solution. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, along with a lot of other things, it's helpful," she said. "The media 
can help, along with the businesses and the private sector and parents at home. 
Principals in junior high and high schools have to talk to the kids about 
tagging." 
</P>
<P>
But for Putney, it's quality and not quantity that matters. "We address lots of 
issues -- drugs, literacy, graffiti, and just the need for self-esteem. If we 
save just one kid, it'll do me some good."

'TWILIGHT ZONE': A WORD FROM THE PRODUCER; 
</P>
<P>
DEATHS: FRANK MARSHALL, WHO NEVER TESTIFIED ABOUT THE TRAGEDY THAT KILLED 
THREE, SAYS, 'IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Frank Marshall, who is making his directing debut with "Arachnophobia," was one 
of those present on the set of "Twilight Zone -- The Movie" the night in 1982 
when a camera helicopter crashed and killed actor Vic Morrow and two immigrant 
Asian children that Marshall knew were illegally employed by the film company. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime associate of Steven Spielberg, Marshall was the executive producer 
of "Twilight Zone" and in the years leading up to the 1987 criminal trial of 
director John Landis and four associates, Marshall was repeatedly sought by the 
Los Angeles district attorney's office to testify. 
</P>
<P>
While Marshall himself was not indicted in the case, deputy district attorney 
Gilbert Garcetti told reporters after the trial that his office made "every 
effort possible to subpoena Frank Marshall but he was able to get out of our 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, who signed the petty cash checks paid to the parents of the two Asian 
children before their deaths, never did testify and until now has never 
responded to questions about his knowledge of "Twilight Zone" events or his 
refusal to testify. Asked to comment on those matters during an interview for 
"Arachnophobia," Marshall called the stories about his alleged evasion of 
subpoenas "all hype. There's no truth to it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said he was busy throughout the pre-trial investigations on "The 
Twilight Zone" case, and blamed investigators for not reaching him in the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually I was here (Los Angeles) a long time, two years, and nobody ever 
talked to me," Marshall said. "Then we went off to England and made 'Empire of 
the Sun,' 'Roger Rabbit' and 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.' So I lived 
in London, and the time most of the trial was going on, we were in China 
(filming 'Empire of the Sun'). 
</P>
<P>
"So, I was inaccessible. And I didn't really feel that I had anything to add 
that wasn't already out there, than what had already been revealed." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said the accident itself was a terrible tragedy that "was terrible and 
horrible for everybody. But it was an accident. Which is eventually what the 
jury decided." SEAN MITCHELL

SECURITY DROPS NET -- TOY GUNS, PARKED CARS ARE SUSPECT

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a policeman recently approached officials at Yorba Linda Preschool and Day 
Care about using it as a security base for Thursday's dedication of the Richard 
M. Nixon Library and Birthplace, he looked around with concern at the playing 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that if we had any toy guns we'd better put them away," recalled Carol 
John, an assistant director at the school. 
</P>
<P>
From a real estate office next door, meanwhile, U.S. Secret Service agents 
began jotting down license numbers of vehicles lingering in the area a full two 
weeks before President Bush and former Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Ford were 
scheduled to appear at the dedication of the nation's ninth presidential 
library. 
</P>
<P>
With the big day drawing ever nearer, a security net the likes of which Yorba 
Linda has never seen is descending rapidly over the sleepy bedroom community of 
50,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Teams of Secret Service agents -- one for each President -- are being deployed 
to provide protection. Bomb-sniffing dogs and walk-through metal detectors are 
being readied for use at the site. More than 150 Orange County police officers 
are rehearsing for their role in ringing the library and surrounding streets. 
Even helicopter gunships are being made available -- just in case. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one is expecting trouble -- the vast majority of the estimated 
20,000 people expected to turn out are predicted to be staunch Nixon loyalists 
-- Secret Service officials say they can never be too ready. 
</P>
<P>
"We go in wary at all times," said Hamilton (Ham) Brown, a retired Secret 
Service agent and executive secretary of the Former Agents' Assn. in Annandale, 
Va. "As a matter of fact, the more friendly the crowd the more vigilant we 
become because you expect the unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
Security preparations for the dedication have been jointly planned by the 
Secret Service and Brea Police Department, which provides police protection for 
Yorba Linda. According to Brea Police Lt. William Lentini, the two entities 
have been meeting constantly in recent weeks to work out such details as street 
closures and officer placements. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Lentini said, the Brea Police Department will be heading a 
contingent of more than several hundred uniformed officers from Brea as well as 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department and nearly every department in the 
county, including Anaheim, Placentia, Fullerton, La Habra, Santa Ana, 
Huntington Beach, Westminster and Costa Mesa. All those officers, he added, 
would primarily be responsible for crowd and traffic control -- but would also 
be available to deal with any demonstrations that got out of control or handle 
other unforeseen problems. 
</P>
<P>
Lentini said he did not expect trouble, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very 'pro' event," Lentini said, adding that he anticipates many 
families in attendance. Lentini said an area will be provided for 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize our obligation to provide an opportunity for those with different 
points of view to express their feelings and concerns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The police will be using grounds at the preschool to store equipment and to 
give officers a place to rest. 
</P>
<P>
As is their custom, Secret Service agents were closemouthed about the specifics 
of their security preparations. Richard Adams, a Secret Service spokesman in 
Washington, emphasized, though, the importance his agency attaches in working 
with local law enforcement such as the Brea police. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on local law enforcement turf," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said the groundwork for the library dedication was laid by the Los 
Angeles office of the Secret Service, while the intricate details of security 
would be handled by a Secret Service detail assigned to protect President Bush. 
Those agents, he said, generally arrive at a presidential venue a week ahead of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Both Reagan and Ford have their own Secret Service details, which Adams said 
will be coordinated by the main presidential team. Nixon did away with his 
Secret Service protection in 1985 and has used private security since. Nixon 
personal assistant John Taylor said the former President would defer to the 
Secret Service in protecting him for his library visit. Taylor declined to 
discuss the security arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon is scheduled to arrive at Yorba Linda Middle School via helicopter and 
then be whisked to the library a few blocks away by police motorcade, said Roy 
Stephenson, Yorba Linda city engineer. The former President will be flying from 
the Century Plaza hotel in Los Angeles, arriving in Yorba Linda at about 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Former Presidents Reagan and Ford will be arriving in bulletproof limousines. 
Bush will have spent the night in the Anaheim Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
If past experience is any indication, however, former agent Brown said Bush's 
helicopter would shuttle him to the library site. 
</P>
<P>
Before any Presidents arrive, the Federal Aviation Administration will have 
already sealed off the airspace around the library to all unauthorized traffic. 
FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said her agency routinely does this at the request 
of the Secret Service. The airspace restrictions usually are lifted after the 
dignitaries have left, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Secret Service officials would not comment about enforcement of 
airspace violations, Brown said local police agencies and even the Marines all 
have armed helicopters on standby to deal with any aerial encroachments. 
</P>
<P>
On the ground, Brown said, the Secret Service will conduct sweeps of the 
nine-acre library grounds with bomb-sniffing dogs and other bomb-detection 
apparatus. The uniformed branch of the Secret Service will also set up 
metal-detecting machines at entrances to the dedication site so all visitors 
can be screened for weapons, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The machines were put into use after Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme attempted to 
assassinate former President Ford in Sacramento in September, 1975, Brown said. 
He said that having the visitors checked gives a little more peace of mind to 
the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
If anything were to happen, Brown said the Secret Service would throw all of 
its protection around the Presidents. If it came down to it, Brown said Bush 
would receive the most security.

ADMINISTRATION INSIDERS STICK TOGETHER IN FEBRUARY GROUP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A few months after he resigned, Richard M. Nixon pondered the fate of the 
hundreds of former White House employees who shared his dreams, fought his 
battles and were then left in the lurch by Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them had trouble finding new jobs, having been tainted by the scandal. 
And many shared an experience from inside the White House that could not really 
be understood by an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, those of us who had these connections were pariahs," recalled 
Ken Khachigian, who began his lauded presidential speech-writing career with 
Nixon. "So you found comfort and solace in being amongst your own." 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1975, Nixon met in San Clemente with a former presidential advance 
man and suggested that he keep in touch with the former White House staffers. 
The following month, Dewey Clower called together 25 of them and launched the 
February Group, named after the month in which its first meeting was held. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight -- 15 years later -- the February Group is scheduled to host one of the 
largest gatherings of Nixon Administration alumni since Watergate. Nixon 
himself is expected to attend the cocktail reception at his presidential 
library in Yorba Linda on the eve of its dedication.

Add all of the longtime Nixon supporters and family scheduled to attend 
Thursday's dedication, and "it will probably be the real first and last 
conclave of those who have been associated with Richard Nixon . . . since his 
second inaugural," said Patrick J. Buchanan, a conservative political 
commentator and former Nixon speech writer. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, where job security is often an oxymoron, an alumni association 
for a presidential administration makes sense. But surprisingly, it is the 
Nixon White House that has created the largest and most active such group. 
</P>
<P>
From the 25 members who organized on Feb. 10, 1975, the group has grown to 
include a mailing list of more than 600, including many members of the Ford and 
Reagan administrations. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, when Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, Clower said, the White 
House used the February Group mailing list to locate potential staff. And the 
group became big enough that columnist Jack Anderson once called it a 
"government in exile." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the February Group meets twice a year, usually for an evening of 
socializing over cocktails with about 100 to 150 people at a Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The February Group is essentially dedicated to maintaining a network that Nixon 
established as early as his 1968 presidential campaign. To do that, it hosts 
the cocktail hours, and from a desktop computer, Clower publishes a periodic 
newsletter with updates on the lives of group members. 
</P>
<P>
Clower gladly points out what the group is not -- it does not have a political 
agenda, it is not for fund raising and it is not even well-organized, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a loose-knit organization: no dues, no officers," Clower said. "It's 
basically just a time for people to get together; it's who is where, who has 
had babies, who got married, who has a new job." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the members, especially those who remain active, are middle-level Nixon 
White House staffers whose names never reached the newspapers. The former 
President's favorite barber, Milt Pitts, is among them. 
</P>
<P>
But Nixon's top officers and Cabinet members are also on the February Group 
rolls. Former chief of staff H.R. Haldeman belongs, as does appointments 
secretary Dwight Chapin and aide John Erlichman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for people who worked together and have stayed in touch or have a chance 
to renew friendships," said Ron Ziegler, Nixon's press secretary and a group 
member. "I think almost everyone who served in those years is on the (mailing) 
list." 
</P>
<P>
Erlichman, now a novelist who lives in Santa Fe, N.M., reportedly sent a letter 
to one February Group gathering that said: "Sorry I can't be there. I'll be 
doing something elsewhere." He was in jail at the time in connection with 
Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
Watergate may have been partly responsible for the cohesion of the former Nixon 
employees -- at least at first. But Clower also said the Nixon White House was 
simply a tighter group than most. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked briefly in the Ford Administration and I think the Nixon people were 
closer together," Clower said. "I think the times probably had something to do 
with it. It is well known that a lot of people had difficulty finding jobs, and 
perhaps things like that draw people together. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when I just want to drop this (February Group activity), but 
then people call up and they really want to keep it going." 
</P>
<P>
Khachigian also said the camaraderie among Nixon's staff is unique. 
</P>
<P>
"The February Group is the Nixon guys who, sort of out the ashes of his 
resignation, said, 'Hey, we ain't down, let's stick together.' " he said. "I 
call it a sort of gathering of the clan. There's a lot of war stories to be 
told." 
</P>
<P>
As for the future of the February Group, Clower said he's uncertain whether it 
will dissolve with the aging of the Nixon staff or whether it will evolve into 
something bigger. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it will continue," he said. "It really has become a group for Republican 
administrations."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
MAN, 26, ARRESTED IN TOT'S BEATING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach man was arrested Tuesday in connection with last week's 
fatal beating of his girlfriend's 14-month-old daughter, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Ichija Yoshisato, 26, was arrested at an undisclosed residence in San 
Diego County at 11 a.m. on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to be charged with first-degree murder with special 
circumstances, child abuse and two counts of rape with a foreign object, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Police Lt. Ed McErlain said investigators focused on Yoshisato 
after interviewing him and others after Felicia Lynn Grunbaum died of massive 
head injuries on July 10. 
</P>
<P>
The child was beaten to death at a house in the 8800 block of Anthony Drive, 
where she lived with her mother, Pepper Ann Grunbaum, 19, and Yoshisato, 
McErlain said. 
</P>
<P>
McErlain declined to elaborate on the circumstances of the murder or on whether 
the child had been abused on prior occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is continuing, and Yshisato is being held without bail at the 
city jail.

ADULT MOVIE SHOWN BY ACCIDENT ON CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comcast Cablevision officials are blaming a malfunctioning television switcher 
for the accidental screening of an adult film on its preview channel. 
</P>
<P>
The non-rated movie, "Cecil Howard's Foxtrot," was shown on Comcast's Channel 
36, which normally shows short segments of upcoming movies on the cable 
service's pay-for-view channels. 
</P>
<P>
The film, which shows several explicit sex acts, aired on the preview channel 
for almost an hour beginning at 9 p.m. before technicians yanked it off the 
airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
The film was supposed to be shown on Channel 39, which shows non-rated and 
R-rated movies, said David Barford, general manager and vice president of 
Comcast Cablevision in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still investigating what happened," Barford said. "We believe our 
switcher malfunctioned and put the movie over Channel 36." 
</P>
<P>
Barford said the switcher prevents viewers from getting channels that are 
scrambled. Comcast has three pay-per-view channels that are scrambled, 
including Channel 39. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, viewers cannot get programming from the scrambled channels unless 
they pay about $4 a program, Barford said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're extremely upset that this happened," Barford said. "We certainly are 
taking measures to make sure this doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
The station reported that it received nine complaints about the screening.

<P>
The City Council agreed Tuesday night to earmark $85,000 on services for 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
In-home care will receive $35,000 through various agencies. The council also 
indicated that they plan to allocate $50,000 for transportation for seniors. 
The city is still looking for an agency to provide that transportation, because 
none of the applicants qualified. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the council allocated $30,000 for shelter space, $28,500 for youth 
crime prevention and $15,000 for health care services. 
</P>
<P>
Community organizations such as Independencia, Feedback Foundation, YMCA, 
Anaheim Interfaith Shelter, Covering Wings, RSVP, and the Boys and Girls Club 
were among the 13 recipients of funds. LISA MASCARO

RECREATION ZONE RULES DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of a long-term plan to renovate Anaheim's prosperous tourist area, the 
City Council council Tuesday night debated new design guidelines for the 
commercial recreation zone around Disneyland and the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Some business people -- especially owners of small businesses -- expressed 
reservations that the improvement plans were being made at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
"The program the city has I think really inhibits the small landowner," said 
Mike Capelouto, whose family owns a small business in the zone. 
</P>
<P>
In past public hearings, business owners and developers have been concerned 
that the new plans were too restrictive. Developers had asked the city for 
development incentives, such as density bonuses, and business people asked for 
more leniency on the uses of signs for their shops. 
</P>
<P>
Some landowners also were concerned that businesses such as fast-food 
restaurants, convenience stores and self-service laundries, which would be 
prohibited under the changes, could in fact be helpful to tourists, especially 
families on a travel budget. 
</P>
<P>
The council will vote on the ordinance covering the zone changes in three 
weeks.LISA MASCARO

ELECTORATE TO DECIDE JOB PROTECTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It will be more difficult to remove the city clerk from office if voters 
approve a proposed City Charter amendment that will appear on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week voted 6 to 1 in favor of presenting an amendment to 
voters that, if passed, would require a two-thirds vote by the City Council to 
fire the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the procedure calls for a simple majority vote. There council has 
seven members. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Daniel E. Griset voted against placing the amendment on the ballot. 
"I've long held the view that the five-vote protection is appropriate for 
managerial positions and the clerk's job is essentially a clerical position," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Acosta disagreed and said the procedure for firing the city 
clerk should be the same as that used to fire the city manager and attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in parity," Acosta said. "I think this brings the clerk in line. We 
have three hired employees and they should all be under the same rules." 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, along with councilmen Richards L. Norton and Ron May, tried 
unsuccessfully two weeks ago to place amendments on the ballot that would 
change the requirements for firing the city manager and city attorney, calling 
for a simple majority vote instead of a two-thirds vote. After those amendments 
were voted down, Norton suggested the amendment concerning the city clerk.GREG

POLICE GET 6.25% RAISE, BENEFITS HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The police association and the city have reached a two-year agreement on police 
salaries, giving all officers a 6.25% raise and an increase in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the city agreed to grant a 5% salary increase next July. 
</P>
<P>
The salary range for a senior police officer now starts out at $3,197 a month, 
topping out at $3,886 per month, said Personnel Director Steve Hayman. 
</P>
<P>
The total package will cost the city $543,000. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings between the city personnel department and the Costa Mesa Police Assn. 
resulted in a .75% increase in medical benefits and an agreement to study 
alternative work weeks, in which officers would be given the opportunity to 
work varying shifts. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, the city's interest in this study is to find out what will 
advance the service levels and productivity out of the work force," Hayman 
said.

$20,000 FOR CONCERT AT AIRPORT REJECTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, or what was left of it at 2 a.m. Tuesday, voted down a 
proposal to pay $20,000 for a performance by the Pacific Symphony at a 
black-tie, VIP reception for the John Wayne Airport dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Citing budget constraints and the event's exclusivity, Councilwoman Sandra L. 
Genis presented what she called "the Marie Antoinette Memorial Let 'em Eat Cake 
Award" and handed out spongecake snacks to council members. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was introduced by Councilman Orville Amburgey, who walked out of 
the meeting during Genis' presentation. The council then voted, 3-0, against 
the request. Councilman Ed Glasgow had left the meeting earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The grand opening of the expanded airport will be Sept. 7 and 8, including 
receptions, tours, performances, ceremonies and special events. If the council 
had agreed to sponsor the symphony's performance, it would have received 100 
free tickets to the event. 
</P>
<P>
Genis also reminded council members that in reviewing the city's 1990-91 
budget, the council had decided that the city could not afford to hire two more 
police officers to catch drunk drivers. MARY ANNE PEREZ

GOOD NEWS FOR ONE FIRST-ROUND DRAFT PICK.

Feeling the crunch of two wasted seasons and an off season dominated by trade 
rumors, Gaston Green reported to training camp this week and was told, in 
effect, that he had a legitimate shot at salvaging his career and the team's 
recent reputation with first-round draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
Then he was sold some swamp land in Florida, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Though most have projected Green a distant third behind Curt Warner and 
Cleveland Gary in this summer's heated tailback race, Coach John Robinson said 
that's simply not the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told the players today that we're looking for the three of them to 
compete in training camp," Robinson said Tuesday. "There's no one that's the 
starter. They're all three competing. The starter comes from the man who 
emerges from that group." 
</P>
<P>
Green, of course, has heard it before, only to enter his third NFL season with 
61 career carries for 190 yards and no touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, Green likes his chances better this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I'm going to get a fair shot," he said. "And all I need is the 
opportunity to play." 
</P>
<P>
Green, the 14th selection overall in the 1988 draft and the first running back 
taken, has had few opportunities. Through it all, Robinson has defended him, 
complimented him, worked with him. He has done everything but play him. 
</P>
<P>
In his rookie season, the former UCLA standout was squeezed out of the picture 
by Greg Bell and Charles White. In 1989, the Rams drafted Gary. This spring, 
they traded Bell to the Raiders but signed free agent Curt Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly votes of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
So what has changed about Green and the Rams' offense? For one, Robinson said 
one tailback will not dominate his game plans anymore. In other words, the 
loser in this summer's tailback derby will not necessarily go directly to the 
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"I do plan to share the job," Robinson said. "So there won't be one person that 
emerges who has 90% of the carries and one that has 10%. I don't want to do 
that. I won't do that. 
</P>
<P>
"If all three backs are even at summer's end, all will play. At least that's 
the company line in July. 
</P>
<P>
"If two are good, and one's not, the one that's not is out," Robinson admitted. 
"If three are good, then we'll try to play them. I don't have a solution. I 
can't give you a solution to how it's going to end. But I think maybe we've 
created the impression that Gaston is not going to get an equal opportunity, 
and that's not true. That will not happen." 
</P>
<P>
As a runner, Green has always had blazing straight-ahead speed. His problems in 
the pros have been durability, running inside and a lack of open-field moves. 
</P>
<P>
Green has not expressed a great desire to be traded, though it's doubtful the 
Rams could get enough in return to match the embarrassment of unloading such a 
high draft choice after just two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has said from the beginning that Green, 24, must be allowed time to 
grow into his body. And while Green said he has not added any weight to his 
192-pound frame, he has added muscle with weightlifting. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a different looking person," Robinson said. "He's thicker, stronger 
and more ready for the competition. I think he will look forward to the 
competition. I think it took him at least a year to adjust to what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Green said it's easier dealing with the critics because he has not been allowed 
the chance to succeed or fail. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, if I'd have had the opportunity to do anything then I'd feel 
pressure," he said. "But since it's just a matter of me getting the chance of 
getting out there to play, there's no pressure. I do think it's going to be a 
good fight, because we all want to play." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Punter Hank Ilesic, a Canadian citizen, is having trouble getting out of 
Montreal to training camp. Monday, he was turned back at the airport because he 
didn't have the proper visa papers. Then, he was turned away because he didn't 
have a round-trip ticket, a requirement when leaving Canada. When Ilesic does 
get here, he'll begin his head-to-head competition with rookie Kent Elmore for 
the team's punting position. . . . Other veterans who have joined workouts this 
week include wide receiver Aaron Cox, tight end Pat Carter and cornerback 
Darryl Henley. Gaston Green will leave camp today and return when the veterans 
report to UC Irvine July 25. Cleveland Gary and Curt Warner will remain to 
better familiarize themselves with the offense . . . Linebacker George Bethune 
suffered a left leg bruise and hamstring strain at Tuesday's practice. He's 
been listed as day-to-day. Free agent wide receiver Anthony Sargent pulled a 
hamstring and will miss one to two weeks.

LAST SEASON'S DEMOTION TO MINORS FUELS SHEFFIELD'S COMEBACK; 
</P>
<P>
BREWERS: AFTER GETTING ADVICE FROM DON BAYLOR, MILWAUKEE INFIELDER MAKES THIS 
YEAR ONE FOR HIS SCRAPBOOK.

<P>
Barely halfway through his rookie season, Milwaukee third baseman Gary 
Sheffield thought the Brewers were ready to give up on him. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he was ready to give up on them. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago I didn't think I would even be in this (Brewer) locker room right 
now," he said. "I wanted to be traded. That was something I wanted more than 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated with his declining batting average, nagging injuries and a demotion 
to the minor leagues, Sheffield decided there were better places to play than 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was going to be traded," Sheffield said. "Everyone was talking about 
how bad I was. That has always stuck in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
But a talk with Brewer hitting coach and former Angel Don Baylor during the 
offseason gave Sheffield a new outlook. Maybe Milwaukee's not such a bad place 
after all, Sheffield decided. 
</P>
<P>
Sheffield's finding out why this season. He entered Tuesday night's game 
against the Angels batting .315, fourth in the American League. He was two for 
four, and reached twice on errors, in the Brewers' 8-1 loss Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheffield says Baylor helped him put the game in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first time I opened up to a person outside of my family," 
Sheffield said of his talk with Baylor. "He just wanted to know the facts, why 
I was unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
Sheffield was quick to tell him. He had opened the season as the Brewers' 
starting shortstop, batting .298 in his first 20 games and hitting three homers 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
Then his performance began to slide. Playing with leg injuries, his batting 
average dropped below .250. The Brewers sent him to their triple-A affiliate in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't care about me last year," Sheffield said. "I was written off in 
the second month of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Sheffield said he felt pressured to succeed by teammates and the management 
because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
"The black players are expected to produce right then and there," Sheffield 
said. "But the white guys just show up. They're the All-American boys. That 
situation has been in my face for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
But Baylor met with the 21-year-old Sheffield and his mother at their home in 
Tampa, Fla., and convinced him the Brewers still wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
"He explained to me how hard it is for a young black player to come into the 
league," Sheffield said. "You have to make adjustments. There's racism on other 
teams and this team, and I can accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Sheffield had a hard time accepting anything his rookie season. He was livid 
when the Brewers demoted him to the minors last July. 
</P>
<P>
He hit only .138 in seven games at Denver before he was diagnosed with a broken 
right foot. He spent the rest of the season on and off the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the lowest point you can go," Sheffield said. "Then I looked at the guy 
(Bill Spiers) they left here to replace me and I said, 'This can't be 
happening.' 
</P>
<P>
"(Spiers) is a good player, but he's not a Gary Sheffield-type player. You 
couldn't compare what he did in the minors to what I did. I had more range than 
him when I was healthy. I just had a few more things to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Catcher B.J. Surhoff said the Brewers expected too much from Sheffield during 
his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to tell what goes through a guy's mind when he's injured and gets 
sent down," Surhoff said. "Part of the problem last year is that he had to bat 
No. 3 right from the beginning. They (the management) were putting more 
pressure on him instead of taking it off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to play shortstop and bat third, especially as a rookie. I remember 
I had a lot of things to learn my rookie year." 
</P>
<P>
But Sheffield's back this season. His foot has healed, and so have his feelings 
toward the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Sheffield started the season batting second, but has since moved to the No. 3 
position, behind Robin Yount and ahead of Dave Parker. 
</P>
<P>
But Sheffield still has one bone to pick with the Brewers. He wants to move 
from third base back to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where my future is," Sheffield said. "But I'll keep my mouth shut and 
do a great job (at third). I'll get a chance at shortstop either here or 
somewhere else."

FULLERTON BASEBALL JOB HAS PERKS, PITFALLS; 
</P>
<P>
TITANS: THE PROGRAM IS DISTINGUISHED, BUT THE MAN WHO REPLACES LARRY COCHELL 
WILL HAVE TO DO A VARIETY OF TASKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Stop at any of the nation's major college baseball ports of call -- Omaha, 
Miami, Austin, Tex., Wichita, Kan. -- say you're with the Cal State Fullerton 
baseball team, and you'll never get the response: "Cal State Who?" 
</P>
<P>
With two national championships and six College World Series appearances in the 
past 16 years, Fullerton is a titan among college baseball programs, much the 
way USC is in football and Georgetown is in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Why, a few weeks ago, former Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido saw a Japanese 
teen-ager wearing a Cal State Fullerton baseball shirt while walking along a 
street in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how big the program is," said Garrido, who was touring Japan with Team 
USA. "If you go around the country and say Cal State Fullerton baseball, 
they'll say, 'That's a great program.' " 
</P>
<P>
But appearances, as Garrido well knows, can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
"The program was a pretty good-looking house on the outside," said Garrido, now 
the coach at Illinois, "but the plumbing didn't always work and you weren't 
sure if the foundation was going to hold." 
</P>
<P>
Garrido has been away from Fullerton three seasons, but the problems that 
contributed to his departure -- lack of financial resources, lack of fan 
support, lack of a first-class playing facility -- are still present at the end 
of Larry Cochell's three-year tenure as coach. 
</P>
<P>
They are the elements that may make it difficult for Cochell's successor to 
succeed and difficult for the school to keep Cochell's successor for a long 
time if he does succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless something changes dramatically, the (baseball coaching) job there still 
appears to be a stepping-stone situation," Garrido said. "If they could have 
changed it, I think they would have for Larry." 
</P>
<P>
No matter who replaces Cochell, who resigned two weeks ago to accept the job at 
Oklahoma, it's a good bet the Titans will be competitive in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
Located in the heart of one of the most fertile recruiting areas of the 
country, blessed with a favorable climate and a winning tradition, the school 
should always be able to attract top-notch players. 
</P>
<P>
But, through no fault of its own, Fullerton doesn't appear to have the 
resources to compete with other schools for top-notch coaches. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the Titan job is still considered a plum position, and the school 
should have no trouble attracting an excellent coach. It's just that the plums 
are ripening elsewhere, making it tempting for Fullerton coaches to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger schools -- often schools with revenue-producing football and basketball 
programs -- have been pumping money into their baseball programs. Many of the 
perks that college football and basketball coaches have enjoyed for years have 
been trickling down to baseball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois attracted Garrido with a six-figure package that included income from 
summer camps and a daily radio show -- not to mention a 4,500-seat stadium and 
strong fan support. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma attracted Cochell with a six-figure package that includes summer 
camps, a radio and television program, a car and an annuity. And, yes, the 
Sooners have a nice baseball facility and solid fan support. 
</P>
<P>
At Fullerton, the football and basketball programs barely generate enough 
revenue to cover their own expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The school doesn't have a nice baseball facility. Construction of the Titan 
Sports Complex, which will include a 1,500-seat baseball stadium, is scheduled 
to begin this fall and completed in 1992, but it could be several years before 
the baseball pavilion, which is to include a press box, concession stand and 
restrooms, is built. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans have little fan support, with home games usually attracting a few 
hundred spectators, at best. The school has advertised the coaching position as 
having an annual salary of $55,464-$66,984, and the program, at least in the 
past, hasn't had the kind of financial alumni and booster support that could 
supplement a coaching package. 
</P>
<P>
"Pound for pound, we can't compare to what other schools are offering," said 
Steve DiTolla, Titan associate athletic director. "But we'll do the best we can 
to maintain the baseball program. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Cal State Fullerton to be a household word in college baseball. There 
are a lot of amenities here you can't put a price tag on, and one is walking 
outside in January and hitting the ball every day." 
</P>
<P>
There are also a lot of amenities that the Fullerton coach has to put a price 
tag on, such as bats, balls and uniforms. This is another aspect of the Titan 
baseball job that makes it less attractive to some. 
</P>
<P>
Most Division I baseball coaches are involved in fund-raising, but at 
Fullerton, the coach is directly responsible for raising about 40% of the 
annual budget, about $106,000 this past season. 
</P>
<P>
Many college coaches raise money for new scoreboards, field improvements and 
other extra items, but the Titan coach raises money to sustain the program -- 
to pay for the bare necessities. In fact, part of the job description is that 
the coach must "assume responsibility for generating financial support for the 
baseball program." 
</P>
<P>
DiTolla admits the responsibility has scared off a few coaches. Cerritos 
College Coach George Horton is interested in the Fullerton job, but when he was 
a finalist for the position in 1987, he withdrew because of the fund-raising 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time they see six figures, they say, 'Whoa, I'm responsible for that? 
You're kidding me?' " DiTolla said. "That's the consistent initial reaction, 
but when you tell them that a lot of these things are in place, it's not as 
intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, much of the fund-raising job for Cochell's successor will be a matter 
of maintaining programs that already are in place. The outfield fence signs at 
Titan Field, for instance, generate about $25,000 a year, and Cochell sees no 
reason why those deals with advertisers shouldn't continue. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell also had a group of five boosters who helped with various fund-raising 
activities, and he plans to pass on those contacts. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to raise a considerable amount of money, but I wasn't the one guy 
doing it," Cochell said. "I had a lot of support. I didn't see it as a scary 
thing. It's part of any job at a Division I university." 
</P>
<P>
But it's much more a part of the Fullerton job than it is at most other top 
Division I programs. 
</P>
<P>
At USC, Coach Mike Gillespie is involved in fund-raising activities, but it's 
not part of his job description. He admits he would find the responsibility of 
raising more than $100,000 a year intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see where certain people wouldn't want to tackle that," Gillespie said. 
"Everyone accepts the fact that you have to be involved to some extent, but to 
be told you are the guy, figure out a way to do it, that's unusual." 
</P>
<P>
At Miami, the baseball program generated about $700,000 this past year, almost 
enough to cover the Hurricanes' expenses. Coach Ron Fraser has become a legend 
in the promotional field, with such fund-raising events as a $5,000-a-plate 
dinner on the field and dinner on a cruise ship. 
</P>
<P>
He even got a doctor to donate an open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
But $380,000 of the money raised this season came from gate receipts. And 
Fraser no longer oversees fund-raising. The school's promotions department 
handles all the details, so Fraser can concentrate on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I don't have to do it anymore," Fraser said. "It's a tough job 
selling baseball in a football world." 
</P>
<P>
Being a part of a lucrative football world has benefited many baseball 
programs, however. Louisiana State Coach Skip Bertman's expenses are covered by 
the school's athletic department, and he has booster groups that raise money 
for extra, luxury items. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't have to sell outfield fence signs or program ads, yet the program 
still turns a profit most years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I'm where I am is we put 80,000 people in the football stadium 
every Saturday and we fill the basketball arena," Bertman said. "Given a few 
bad years in both sports, and I'm back on the street again, begging for money. 
Not all schools can do that, and that's what makes it hard for schools like 
Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
Garrido can attest to that. Even though he was able to raise enough money to 
compete at a high level, the burden wore on him over the years. There were 
times, he said, when he felt like he was in the fence-sign, media-guide and 
camp business, not the baseball business. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not moving ahead personally by developing these projects because the 
profits were used to sustain the program," Garrido said. "The university pays 
for everything at Illinois, so I have time to develop things like radio shows, 
and I get revenues from those things. 
</P>
<P>
"At Fullerton, there isn't any time to develop yourself personally and to 
develop assistant coaches personally. You have to keep good people, and to keep 
them, you have to have benefits. That's what Illinois does for me and what 
Oklahoma is doing for Larry." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his feelings about his departure in 1987, Garrido has expressed 
interest in returning to Fullerton. His three-year contract at Illinois expires 
in August and he has not negotiated a new one. Garrido said he eventually wants 
to return to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But not if the circumstances surrounding the Fullerton job are still the same 
as they were when he left. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to be able to be in a position to identify problems and have the 
resources and opportunities to solve them," Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
But can that ever happen at Fullerton? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way," Garrido said. "It didn't happen before I got there, it 
didn't happen while I was there, and it didn't happen to prevent me or Larry 
from leaving."

FULLERTON: CITY APPROVES TAYLOR WOODROW DESPITE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING 
COMPANY'S WORK AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT.

Taylor Woodrow Construction California Ltd. -- a company that recently filed a 
lawsuit against the county and is embroiled in controversy surrounding its work 
at the John Wayne Airport terminal -- is one step away from building a $7.9 
million sports complex at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday approved Cal State Fullerton's choice of Taylor 
Woodrow because the contracting company was the project's lowest bidder, met 
qualifications required by the California State University system and is 
involved with successful construction projects at Cal State campuses in Long 
Beach and San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Final approval of Taylor Woodrow is expected in September when the Cal State 
University board of trustees vote on the selection. The complex is a joint city 
and university project. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager William Winter expressed apprehension over the university's choice 
of Taylor Woodrow, saying the city is "relying completely" on Cal State 
Fullerton's report. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton has "done some extensive checking on Taylor Woodrow and 
feel they can handle the job," Winter said. "We're just pleased that we were 
able to get a bid that meets our cost parameters." 
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Taylor Woodrow Construction California Ltd. has been under 
attack by county officials for alleged cost delays in its construction of the 
John Wayne Airport terminal. In May, the company sued the county alleging 
breach of contract after it was stripped of the $25-million road and parking 
garage contract at the airport. The company is seeking $7.2 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Orange County airport terminal, Taylor Woodrow California is 
involved in a $30-million project on the Anaheim Convention Center, which city 
officials have said is three months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd., a subsidiary of Taylor 
Woodrow Construction California Ltd., is involved in a dispute with the city of 
Laguna Niguel, which is threating to halt some housing construction on 99 acres 
of park land the company received. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the controversy, city officials still are confident in Cal State 
Fullerton's choice. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had numerous conversations with the university about its choice of 
Taylor Woodrow," said City Councilman Richard Ackerman, noting that the 
"airport issue" was a the primary topic. "But I feel comfortable with the 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
Ackerman said a penalty clause is included in the proposed contract, and would 
fine Taylor Woodrow if it is not able to meet the completion date. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Bond, associate vice president for facility planning for Cal State 
Fullerton, said the company would be assessed a daily fine of $3,000 every day 
it goes beyond the completion date. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on whether the board of trustees approves Taylor Woodrow, 
construction is scheduled to begin Sept. 24. The project is expected to be 
completed by the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
According to state guidelines regarding the Cal State University bidding 
process, if a contractor meets the university's qualifications and guidelines, 
the school must pick the lowest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
The university was hoping to build the complex for $6 million. But of the three 
bids submitted in June to the university, Taylor Woodrow was the lowest at $7.9 
million. The entire project is expected to cost $10.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Johnson, a consultant hired by Taylor Woodrow to act as the company 
spokesperson, defended Taylor Woodrow's record, saying the company is involved 
in a wide variety of jobs, and it would be unfair to compare the magnitude of 
the John Wayne Airport project to a project such as Cal State Fullerton's 
sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
Sal Rinella, Cal State Fullerton's vice president for administration, said the 
city plans to front the entire $10.2 million for the project, of which $4.7 
million will be paid back by the university through annual revenues based on 
its share of the Marriott Hotel.

MAN ACCUSED OF FRAUD, THEFT IN SECURITIES SCAM

<P>
A Costa Mesa man has been arrested and charged with bilking investors by 
selling worthless securities in a Pennsylvania oil and gas company, Newport 
Beach police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
David E. Arnold, 38, was arraigned Monday in Harbor Municipal Court in Newport 
Beach and charged with 25 counts of grand theft, telemarketing fraud, 
securities fraud and the sale of unregistered securities. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold is accused of running a so-called boiler room operation known as the St. 
James Financial Group from a small office in Newport Beach, police said. The 
firm is alleged to have used telephone solicitors to sell an investment known 
as the PennGas Insured Drilling Program, Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis said Arnold was arrested Friday at his Costa Mesa home. He is being held 
in Orange County Jail with bail set at $25,000, a court clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen investors allegedly lost a total of $238,000 while St. James Financial 
was in operation in 1987 and 1988, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the investments were for $14,000, said Police Detective Doug 
Parmentier, who investigated the case. He said investors were told that they 
were buying interests in oil and gas wells in a proven field and that their 
investment was insured for repayment. 
</P>
<P>
Investors allegedly were told by St. James that the wells were insured by its 
general partner in Texas, which was doing the actual drilling, Parmentier said. 
He refused to name the Texas partner, which he said is the subject of a federal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Parmentier said one St. James customer told him that he decided to invest 
because of potential tax writeoffs and because the program seemed to be of 
minimal risk. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the investors received occasional checks for $100 to reassure them of 
their investment, Parmentier said. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1987, Newport Beach police began receiving phone calls from worried 
investors who said they couldn't reach St. James Financial, Parmentier said. 
The company closed in the spring of 1988, he said, and police began an 
investigation in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which was incorporated in the U.S. Virgin Islands, had been open 
for business for less than two years, Parmentier said. He said he does not know 
why it closed. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying in hearings before Congress last week, law enforcement officials 
called Southern California, especially Orange County, the "boiler room fraud 
capital" of the United States.

BROKERAGE SUES FORMER EMPLOYEES FOR $5 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: PALO ALTO-BASED MARCUS &amp; MILLICHAP ALLEGES THAT THE FOUNDERS 
OF NEWPORT BEACH'S SPERRY VAN NESS PIRATED AWAY OTHER WORKERS AND 
MISAPPROPRIATED CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A large Palo Alto-based real estate brokerage with offices in Southern 
California has sued two former employees for $5 million, alleging that they 
"boldly and recklessly" pirated away its other employees after they started 
their own company three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus &amp; Millichap Real Estate Investment Brokerage Co. also accused Mark 
Van Ness and Rand Sperry of spiriting away clients and said they 
misappropriated confidential information when they started Newport Beach's 
Sperry Van Ness Investment Real Estate brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Both firms compete in a specialized niche of the brokerage market: representing 
buyers and sellers of properties. At many firms the brokers also represent 
landlords, tenants or both in lease deals. 
</P>
<P>
Sperry Van Ness said in a statement Tuesday that the charges are unfounded and 
that Marcus &amp; Millichap "has a turnover problem and they are trying to 
point a finger at Sperry Van Ness." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that they are attempting to slow us down with legal maneuvers," Van 
Ness said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Ness worked at Marcus &amp; Millichap for five years. He was regional 
manager of the Newport Beach office when he left in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Rand Sperry was a senior broker who worked at Marcus &amp; Millichap less than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
As the real estate market has slowed, competition has intensified among local 
commercial brokerages and sometimes has spilled into court. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' Daum Commercial Industrial Real Estate, for instance -- one of 
Southern California's oldest brokerages -- sued Irvine-based upstart Scher-Voit 
Commercial Brokerage Co. two years ago for allegedly pirating brokers and real 
estate listings. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies eventually settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
The investment market -- in which both Sperry Van Ness and Marcus &amp; 
Millichap specialize -- is especially weak these days, say some brokers, as 
Japanese buyers in particular have taken a lower profile. Economic conditions 
in Japan are weaker and the Japanese also fear stirring a backlash in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Marcus &amp; Millichap suit, filed Monday in San Diego County Superior 
Court, alleges that Van Ness violated a signed agreement saying he wouldn't 
solicit employees or clients from the company for two years after leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the suit alleges, Van Ness and others conspired in a "far-reaching 
scheme of insider raiding." 
</P>
<P>
According to the firm's legal complaint, Sperry and Van Ness plundered 
"literally thousands" of Marcus &amp; Millichap documents, including "what 
amounted to client lists and client profile data"; disrupted and hurt "the 
morale and effectiveness of (the firm's) work force"; and stole clients by 
falsely telling them Sperry Van Ness was "more knowledgeable and 
better-skilled" than Marcus &amp; Millichap. 
</P>
<P>
The Marcus &amp; Millichap office in San Diego was especially hard hit by the 
alleged raids, a Marcus &amp; Millichap spokesman said, and that's why the suit 
was filed there. The two companies compete directly in that city, where Sperry 
Van Ness opened an office in March, and in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks for an injunction to bar Sperry Van Ness from the alleged 
raiding, which the suit says will cause "irreparable harm" to the "financial 
success, morale and economic viability" of its Southern California operations 
if not stopped; at least $5 million in compensation for revenue Marcus &amp; 
Millichap allegedly lost to its rival, and an unspecified amount in punitive 
damages for the courts to determine. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time Marcus &amp; Millichap has sued former employees who 
it alleged had pirated away clients and brokers. The firm said it recently 
settled a similar suit against two former employees in its San Francisco 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Although the terms of that settlement are confidential, the firm said the two 
brokers had agreed to pay it an unspecified sum and admitted mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
But Sperry Van Ness said the charges against it are "frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
The firm has attracted brokers from other companies because, unlike Marcus 
&amp; Millichap, it is set up to share profits with its brokers through 
partnerships, Sperry said in the statement issued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
And, Van Ness said, Marcus &amp; Millichap is trying to blame its own problems 
on his firm. When Van Ness left the brokerage's Newport Beach office, he said 
in the statement, it had 12 senior brokers. There is only one left, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have you think that we stole the other 11, when in fact only one 
senior broker joined us," Van Ness said. "And he solicited us." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, nine brokers have defected from Marcus &amp; Millichap to Sperry 
Van Ness, said Sperry, who contended that all of them were "disgruntled" with 
his competitor's more regimented corporate style. The nine brokers included 
five in San Diego, three in Newport Beach and one in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Sperry and Van Ness said their company has grown rapidly to become a 
medium-sized broker in Southern California by sharing profits and by exploiting 
the investment niche in the market while shunning the transition to a 
full-service brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Sperry Van Ness says it has 25 brokers each in its Newport Beach and Ontario 
offices and 18 in its newer San Diego office. 
</P>
<P>
It specializes in sales of shopping centers, apartment complexes, office 
buildings, industrial parks and land. 
</P>
<P>
Much-larger Marcus &amp; Millichap has 15 offices in the West and Southwest 
with 1989 sales of $1.35 billion.

WELLS FARGO GAINS STRENGTH IN SOUTHLAND; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: THE PURCHASE OF GREAT AMERICAN BANK'S 130 BRANCH OFFICES WOULD MAKE 
THE STATE'S OLDEST LENDER NO. 1 IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. 
</P>

<P>
A year ago, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Carl E. 
Reichardt put the banking industry on alert that his company would consider 
buying thrifts to beef up its relatively small presence in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
With its planned $492-million purchase of the California branch network of 
Great American Bank, a troubled but well-known savings institution in San 
Diego, Wells would quickly zoom to first from seventh place among banks and 
thrifts in fast-growing San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Its market share of deposits there would quadruple, to 16%, surpassing the 7% 
or so of both Security Pacific National Bank and Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
For 138-year-old Wells Fargo, California's oldest bank, the purchase is the 
latest example of its dramatic shift from its historical stance as a bank 
primarily for Northern California. It also signifies the growing dominance of 
much more populous Southern California as a market for banking services. 
</P>
<P>
The deal also underscores Wells' strategy of sticking to its bread-and-butter 
home turf of California for expansion, rather than growing into other states or 
countries. Rivals Security Pacific and Bank of America also have been expanding 
their California branch networks but are making acquisitions elsewhere as well. 
</P>
<P>
William Zuendt, vice chairman for retail banking for Wells, said he views the 
deal as possibly more significant than Wells' 1986 purchase of Crocker National 
Bank, which doubled the bank's presence in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"This acquisition accomplishes more important growth than Crocker," Zuendt said 
Tuesday after the Great American deal was announced. "We will be first in San 
Diego and (essentially) tied in Orange County" with Bank of America and 
Security Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two decades, Wells has slowly built its presence in the Southland 
by opening branches and buying other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Wells completed purchases of the seven-branch Torrey Pines 
Bank in Solana Beach, San Diego County; American National Bank, with 28 
branches in the Central Valley, and the seven-office Valley National Bank, 
based in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Great American Bank's 130 California branch offices under familiar blue slate 
roofs would give Wells Fargo a strong franchise and enable it quickly to pump 
up its presence in Orange and Riverside counties. Great American has branches 
as far north as Sonoma County, but most are in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good way to get market share in a hurry," said Michael Abrahams, a 
banking industry analyst with the investment firm of Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This almost certainly won't be Wells' last purchase, according to Zuendt. 
"Wells is obviously interested in acquiring good franchises," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Security Pacific is launching a nationwide expansion bid, it recently 
purchased financial institutions in San Diego, La Jolla and Valencia. It also 
bought the 83-office California network of Gibraltar Savings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for good-quality acquisitions at the right price," said Terry 
Perucca, senior vice president for corporate planning and acquisitions at 
Security Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America, with a powerful retail banking network of 857 branches 
throughout California, recently bought four branches of First Federal Savings 
&amp; Loan in Bakersfield but consolidated three of those into its existing 
seven offices in the area, for a net gain of one. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America also is still shopping. "We continue to review operations in 
other Western states and California as well," said spokesman John Keane.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, HUGHES DISCUSS 'STAR WARS' CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. said it is negotiating a contract with 
Hughes Aircraft Co. under which Hughes' Electro Optical &amp; Data Systems 
subsidiary in El Segundo would build a ground-based surveillance and tracking 
system for a Star Wars defense. 
</P>
<P>
The subcontract's value is about $85 million. McDonnell Douglas is developing 
the system for the U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command in Huntsville, Ala. The 
subcontract is part of McDonnell Douglas' $338-million contract from the 
Strategic Defense Organization that runs through 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The system would be used to distinguish warheads from decoys, establish missile 
trajectories and points of impact, and assist with missile interception. Hughes 
would build the sensors for the tracking system.

Health Care Merger Scrubbed: Orange-based Admar Group Inc. said Monday that it 
will not proceed with its proposed merger with Capp Care Inc. of Fountain 
Valley because the two companies could not resolve "philosophical differences." 
The merger would have created one of the largest preferred provider networks in 
the country, providing health-care service to 700 hospitals.

COUPLE SEEK SCR GRANTS DATA FROM STATE ARTS COUNCIL AND NEA

A married couple, who touched off the Costa Mesa arts-funding controversy when 
they charged South Coast Repertory with using city funds to pay for a flyer 
urging support of the National Endowment for the Arts, may be taking their beef 
with the theater company to a higher level. 
</P>
<P>
According to several sources, John and Ernie Feeney have requested and received 
copies of SCR's grants from the California Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
And Martin Benson, SCR co-founder and artistic director, said the theater 
company has been told that the Feeneys also requested and received a copy of 
SCR's most recent NEA grant. 
</P>
<P>
The Feeneys could not be reached for comment Tuesday, but a spokeswoman for 
Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach) confirmed that they asked for 
the legislator's assistance in obtaining the state documents. Joanne Anglin of 
the CAC said she received and processed the request about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Anglin, and Barbara Kling of Frizzelle's office, both said they have not been 
contacted by the Feeneys regarding any further action. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what their particular purpose is," Benson said Tuesday, but he 
added that he presumes it relates to the pro-NEA flyer. The grant documents are 
public record, Benson noted: "They're welcome to wade through it at their 
leisure." RICK VANDERKNYFF

SILVER-TONGUED KRIS TAMES MUSTANG SET

If one were to excise all the songs using the word "freedom" from Kris 
Kristofferson's opening show Monday at the Crazy Horse Steak House, the 
singer's set would have lasted about as long as a cigarette. As it was, he gave 
the packed house more than 90 minutes of freedom-toutin' tunes which, 
remarkably, never made his chosen banner seem rote or redundant. 
</P>
<P>
One reason may be that Kristofferson and his seven-member Borderlords not only 
sang about freedom but performed with a goodsome heap of it. Though only the 
second show of the tour (the first was a benefit Saturday at the Crazy Horse to 
aid the homeless), the craggedly handsome singer and band displayed a cohesive, 
sure-in-the-saddle musicality that allowed them to hold loose rein on the 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, Kristofferson brought a convincing emotion to his lyrics and 
weather-stained baritone. There was an immediacy and passion for life in all of 
the show's 25 songs, whether they detailed the tender truths and fuzzy 
morning-afters of his free-living earlier years or railed at the abuses of 
freedom he sees our government practicing here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
And, as usual, he pulled no punches: He declared in his opening "The Eagle and 
the Bear" (a song decrying U.S. and Soviet meddling in the Third World), "I 
will help my brother -- and if you don't like it, Mister, I don't care." 
</P>
<P>
It's a testament to Kristofferson's talents that he can play a country saloon 
in the heart of Bush country, sing the praises of Jesse Jackson, the 
Sandinistas and Leonard Peltier (the American Indian leader convicted in a 
disputed trial of shooting FBI agents) and leave not only with all his teeth, 
but with two standing ovations. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding the sometimes-didactic mood of some past local performances, he freely 
mixed his personal and political material. "They Killed Him" (a cry for fallen 
martyrs from Jesus to Martin Luther King) and other songs expressed a 
confrontational Christianity. "The Best of All Possible Worlds" was an 
uproarious, lurching hangover song. "Jesse Jackson" was an unabashed anthem for 
the man and his ideals ("There's a better world a-comin'/Where a man can help a 
man and show some heart") while "Johnny Lobo" told an Indian's tragic tale, 
concluding, "All the dreams are dead but not forgotten/murdered like the holy 
buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
He offered a driving, roadhouse rendition of "Me and Bobby McGee," a rocking, 
Waylon-ized "Help Me Make It Through the Night" and a moody, ruminative "Sunday 
Morning Coming Down," which segued into "The Silver-Tongued Devil and I." Among 
his new songs was a playful ode to fidelity, a refusal of temptation by a 
family man who doesn't fool around any more, offering, "But if I did, I'd sure 
like to fool around with you." Mixing material that is rowdy, politically 
rousing or overtly religious might make for a cluttered show in many 
performers' hands. But Kristofferson made it all blend as parts of a life fully 
lived.

With former President Richard M. Nixon still avoiding most public events, 
organizers of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace put finishing touches 
on the facility today and prepared for this afternoon's arrival of President 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
At the library, William E. Simon, Nixon's secretary of the Treasury, hosted a 
luncheon for about 50 longtime supporters of Nixon and the library. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were Charles (Bebe) Rebozo, one of Nixon's closest friends. 
Max Fisher, an oil magnate and Nixon friend, was also among the guests, as was 
Carl N. Karcher, founder of Orange County-based Carl's Jr. fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is scheduled to arrive late this afternoon at El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, and from there will travel to the Anaheim Hilton, where he and his 
party are spending the night. Bush will also keep a low profile today, but will 
host a California Republican Party fund-raising breakfast Thursday before 
attending the dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Former members of Nixon's staff are also arriving today and plan a reunion 
cocktail reception at the library. The party is organized by the February 
Group, an organization of former Nixon aides, and Nixon himself is expected to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be the real first and last conclave of those who have been 
associated with Richard Nixon . . . since his second inaugural," said Patrick 
J. Buchanan, a former Nixon speech writer.

SUSPECTED GANG MEMBER SHOT AFTER SCUFFLE IN ARLETA HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old suspected gang member who had entered an Arleta home for unknown 
reasons was shot and critically wounded this morning by its occupant, Los 
Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The injured Pacoima man was placed on life-support equipment at Holy Cross 
Medical Center after the 2 a.m. shooting in the 13800 block of Wingo Street, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
His name was not released because his family had not been notified. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when he and a 17-year-old boy, both identified by police as 
members of a Pacoima gang, allegedly broke into the Wingo Street home of Isaiah 
Brewster, 28, and threatened Brewster with a handgun, Detective Al Ferrand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brewster was an acquaintance of the two intruders but is not believed to be a 
gang member. The motive for the break-in is not known, Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
During the confrontation, a fight broke out and the two intruders fled. Police 
said Brewster grabbed a shotgun from his home and chased after the 23-year-old, 
shooting him in the upper body. 
</P>
<P>
Brewster was detained and questioned by police but was released. The juvenile 
was arrested in the neighborhood on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon 
and was being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall.

LAGUNA NIGUEL SEEKS TO VOID '88 ACTION

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a fiery meeting, the Laguna Niguel City Council this morning voted to go 
to court in a bid to void a 1988 transaction that gave up public rights to 
nearly 100 acres once planned for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a 3 1/2-hour executive session shortly after 1 a.m., the council 
voted 4 to 0 to halt further development on the property and to sue Taylor 
Woodrow Homes California Ltd. for damage caused by the luxury homes already 
built on the land. 
</P>
<P>
All public interest in the land, estimated to be worth between $40 million and 
$70 million, was relinquished in a deed signed by Laguna Niguel Councilman 
James F. Krembas three months before Taylor Woodrow hired his wife. About 100 
homes now stand on the property and foundations for another 77 have been laid. 
The land, now part of the Marina Hills subdivision, borders the Salt Creek 
Corridor Regional Park. "We are saying that our business is protecting the 
public's property and the public's rights," Laguna Niguel Mayor Patricia Bates 
said. "And when necessary we will do it with force." 
</P>
<P>
Krembas, who is under investigation by the Orange County district attorney's 
office, abstained. He reiterated his earlier denials of impropriety on his 
part, suggesting that the blame lies elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Krembas alleged that Taylor Woodrow had misrepresented the deed as part of 
another transaction and that government officials had failed to correct the 
misconception. He signed the deed while serving on the Laguna Niguel Community 
Services District. 
</P>
<P>
The council early today also voted to investigate the actions of James S. 
Okazaki, then the district board's attorney who notarized the deed, and James 
S. Mocalis, the chief executive of the board who signed the deed. Krembas said 
he was pleased by the action. 
</P>
<P>
"I said there were no improprieties that the CSD committed," Krembas said. "I 
did not say there were no improprieties all the way around." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow President Gordon Tippell appeared stunned by the action. 
Tippell, two lawyers and other staff members came armed with stacks of 
documents and maps prepared to explain the land transfer but were given a total 
of six minutes to present their case. 
</P>
<P>
Tippell told the council that his firm's plans to build on the land previously 
dedicated as open space had been approved by the county in 1985 in exchange for 
a park and ball fields and other public benefits. Krembas' signature on the 
deed "simply formalized this agreement," Tippell said. 
</P>
<P>
Tippell also contended that the district board had been fully apprised of the 
land transfer -- and in fact voted to approve it -- at a meeting on Jan. 20, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The council's vote came after an emotionally charged meeting that drew a 
standing-room-only crowd of more than 100 residents who packed the tiny council 
chambers and spilled over into a parking lot. About a dozen residents who told 
the council that they were shocked and saddened by news accounts of the land 
transfer drew applause and occasional cheers from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-nine acres disappeared, and I say to myself, 'How can that happen?' " 
said Charles Gorenstein, director of the Laguna Niguel Environmental Coalition, 
pounding his fist on the speaker's podium.

The embalmed body of Georgi Dimitrov, the founder of the Bulgarian Communist 
state and one of the most graphic symbols of the hated regime, was cremated in 
Sofia today after being moved from its mausoleum, the Bulgarian news agency BTA 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
A commission of prominent politicians, scientists and cultural figures had 
debated since January the question of moving Dimitrov's body from its resting 
place of 40 years. The mausoleum had been the site of recent protests. 
</P>
<P>
Dimitrov was once head of the Soviet-dominated Comintern, the international 
Communist movement, and was also an adviser of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. He 
took power in Bulgaria in 1946 after King Simeon II was deposed.

Five bomb-squad experts trying to dig up and destroy a cache of World War II 
artillery shells were killed today when plastic explosives they were using 
detonated accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
The men were part of a special security force unit dispatched to help dispose 
of more than 2,660 German shells found this month along a roadway outside 
Epervans in east-central France. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the plastic explosives were to be used to destroy the latest 
batch of shells dug up from the site. It was not immediately known what caused 
the blast. 
</P>
<P>
A civilian driving a bulldozer suffered slight burns and was hospitalized. He 
was reported in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
According to records, 608 members of the explosives unit have been killed since 
it was created in 1945 to dispose of mines, bombs and shells left over from the 
war.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thurmond Bishop today approved the $52-million sale of 
fallen television evangelist Jim Bakker's PTL empire to a faith healer based in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelist Morris Cerullo, who occasionally appeared on the old "Jim and Tammy 
Show," was not present in U.S. Bankruptcy Court when the deal was approved. 
</P>
<P>
He had already deposited $7 million in an escrow account to secure his purchase 
of the ministry's television satellite network. For an additional $45 million, 
Cerullo will get 2,200 acres of rolling hills, streams and wooded areas that 
make up Heritage USA, the religious retreat that became a mecca for PTL 
followers.

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, saying "the Arabs have a 
legitimate concern," called on the United States today to use its influence 
with Israel to stop the settlement of Soviet Jews in the Israeli-occupied Arab 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking after two hours and 15 minutes of talks with Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III, the Soviet envoy said he urged that Washington "use all its

GREENSPAN SAYS FED WILL ACT TO BAR RECESSION

<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan sent a strong signal today that 
the central bank will act decisively to keep the country out of a recession by 
lowering interest rates once policy-makers agree on a deficit-reduction 
package. 
</P>
<P>
In his strongest comments to date, Greenspan sought to reassure members of 
Congress that the Fed will do its part in any effort to significantly attack 
the huge federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Many Republican critics of tax increases have charged that President Bush's 
reversal on the tax question threatens to push the country into a recession by 
increasing the tax burden at a time when the economy is already growing at a 
sluggish rate. 
</P>
<P>
However, Greenspan, delivering the Fed's midyear economic report today, said "a 
major cut in the budget is unquestionably the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
While Greenspan said that the specific details of any Fed response to a 
deficit-reduction package would depend on the performance of the economy at the 
time, he left no doubt that the central bank would move to offset the adverse 
effects on growth from government spending cuts and tax increases by lowering 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Major, substantive, credible cuts in the budget deficit would present the 
Federal Reserve with a situation that would call for a careful reconsideration 
of its policy," Greenspan said. "I can only offer the assurance that the 
Federal Reserve will act, as it has in the past, to endeavor to keep the 
economic expansion on track." 
</P>
<P>
After keeping interest rates unchanged since December, the Fed took a modest 
step toward easing them on Friday. It supplied enough additional cash to the 
banking system to push a key interest rate, the federal funds rate, down from 
8.25% to 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan confirmed today that the Fed had eased slightly last week, saying the 
action was taken to offset the effects of banks becoming overly cautious in 
making loans.

Housing construction fell in June for the fifth consecutive month, pushing the 
level of building activity to its lowest point since the depths of the last 
recession, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported a drop of 2.3% in housing starts last month, 
with new homes and apartments being built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 1.18 million units. 
</P>
<P>
The June decline followed decreases of 0.9% in May, 6.9% in April, 12.2% in 
March and 5.1% in February. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time housing construction has fallen for five months in a 
row since a string of declines from July through November of 1981. It pushed 
the level of building activity to its lowest point since October, 1982.

The nation's truck companies joined with safety groups today to push for a 
federal order to stop truckers from using radar detectors. 
</P>
<P>
With new evidence that 37% to 52% of tractor-trailer trucks use the dashboard 
devices in some states, heads of eight national organizations signed a petition 
to the Federal Highway Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Donohue, president of the American Trucking Assns., which represents 4,500 
truck companies, said his group backs police efforts to catch speeding truckers 
and opposes radar detectors. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason you'd want to have one in a truck is to drive faster than you 
ought to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only Connecticut, Virginia and the District of Columbia outlaw detectors in all 
vehicles, and New York has passed a law banning them in larger trucks. They are 
legal in all other states, with about 2 million sold each year.

A ceremonial handshake today on the fifth floor of the massive General Motors 
Corp. building began a process that some observers predict may end in a strike 
of at least one Big Three auto maker in September. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the giant auto maker and the United Auto Workers union for 
a new national labor contract got under way after a 10-minute photo opportunity 
in which GM Vice President Alfred S. Warren Jr. and UAW President Owen Bieber 
reached across a table to shake hands. 
</P>
<P>
UAW talks with Ford Motor Co. will begin Thursday, with Chrysler Corp. 
negotiations to open Friday. The three contracts expire at midnight Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
As negotiators smiled inside, about 2,000 demonstrators gathered outside to 
demand increased cost-of-living allowances for UAW retirees. Union leaders 
earlier rejected an effort to make such allowances a key issue of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators today chanted "Millions for Roger; peanuts for us," referring 
to GM Chairman Roger Smith's hefty retirement plan.

Sibling rivalry played a role in Spike Lee's latest film, "Mo' Better Blues." 
</P>
<P>
The director's 29-year-old sister, Joie, stars in the film as Indigo, a teacher 
whose relationship with a trumpet player, portrayed by Denzel Washington, is 
challenged by another woman and his love for his music. 
</P>
<P>
"We went at it all the time," Joie Lee says in the Aug. 7 issue of US magazine. 
"I would yell, 'I'm not disagreeing with you as your sniveling younger sister. 
I'm disagreeing with you as an actress. And you're not talking to me as a 
director, you're talking to me as my older brother.' " 
</P>
<P>
But she loves the part her brother wrote for her. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Spike has captured some sort of essence of me," she said. "And there 
are so few positive roles out there for women, let alone black women, that I'm 
grateful for it." 
</P>
<P>
Lee's sister also had roles in his films "She's Gotta Have It," "School Daze" 
and "Do the Right Thing."

NOW HAILS STUDIO DECISION TO SHELVE FILM STARRING CLAY

<TEXT>
<P>
The National Organization for Women is praising a movie studio's decision to 
shelve a comedy concert film starring the foulmouthed comedian Andrew Dice 
Clay. 
</P>
<P>
The untitled concert film was listed as an Aug. 31 release from 20th Century 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
The studio announced this week that it will not open the film next month, 
saying the release could jeopardize Clay's career as a dramatic film actor. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a tremendous victory," the Los Angeles chapter of NOW said on its 
hot line Tuesday. The organization, which has picketed theaters showing Clay's 
film "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane," said, "We don't think rape and violence 
against women and incest is funny." 
</P>
<P>
Clay's stand-up act includes graphic descriptions of submissive women, incest 
and oral sex. Some critics have called him misogynist, racist and homophobic; 
Clay has been banned by MTV: Music Television and was boycotted by two female 
performers on "Saturday Night Live."

GARBO'S ART AND ANTIQUES COLLECTION TO GO ON AUCTION BLOCK

<P>
The art and antiques collection of Greta Garbo, valued in excess of $20 
million, will be sold by Sotheby's auction gallery in mid-November, it was 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
John Marion, president of Sotheby's North America, said the collection reflects 
the "unique vision, sensitivity to color and sophisticated taste" of the film 
star, who died in New York on April 15 at the age of 84. 
</P>
<P>
"For more than 50 years, Greta Garbo acquired art and antiques with the eye and 
passion of a serious collector," Marion said. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the sale will go to Garbo's estate, which was left to a niece, 
Gray Reisfield, wife of a New Jersey gynecologist and resident of Passaic, N.J. 
Garbo's will is being contested by a nephew in Sweden who was not named as a 
beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
Marion said Garbo's collection includes a number of important French 
Impressionist and modern paintings including three intimate scenes by Renoir, a 
Bonnard still life, and works by Van Dongen, d'Espagnat, Jawlensky, Rouault and 
Valtat. 
</P>
<P>
Her furniture, he said, is mainly French 18th Century, and will be sold along 
with Savonnerie carpets and European and Chinese ceramics, rare books, and a 
group of decorative paintings and drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the lots in the one-owner sale have been removed from Garbo's apartment 
on Manhattan's East 52nd Street, according to Sotheby's. They are the first of 
Garbo's possessions, which include important Los Angeles real estate and other 
investments, to be sold.

'THE EQUALIZER' INFRINGEMENT SUIT REVIVED; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS FEDERAL JUDGE'S DISMISSAL OF CASE 
CONTENDING SCREENWRITER'S CONCEPT WAS STOLEN.

<P>
A federal appeals court has revived a suit claiming "The Equalizer," whose 
pursuit of justice for the underdog had a four-year run on CBS, was stolen from 
a Los Angeles screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-0 ruling Tuesday by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a 
federal judge's decision dismissing the copyright-infringement suit by veteran 
writer-producer Lou Shaw against the network and others who he said pirated his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw submitted a pilot television script called "The Equalizer" to Richard 
Lindheim, then an NBC television executive, on an option basis in 1978. NBC 
rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Lindheim, who had moved to Universal Television, and Michael 
Sloan wrote a script also called "The Equalizer," a name Lindheim admitted he 
had copied from Shaw. The series, about a wealthy lone crime-fighter seeking to 
right wrongs of the downtrodden, ran on CBS from 1985 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's suit was thrown out by U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler, who 
said the two scripts had similarities in theme, plot, characters and dialogue 
but did not have the same "total concept and feel." But the appeals court said 
such a subjective decision should be made by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
"A subjective assessment of the 'concept and feel' of two works of literature 
(is) a task no more suitable for a judge than for a jury," said the opinion by 
Judge Arthur A. Alarcon. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Because each of us differs, to some degree, in our capability to 
reason, imagine and react emotionally, subjective comparisons of literary works 
that are objectively similar in their expression of ideas must be left to the 
trier of fact," the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Once a judge has decided that objective factors in two literary works, such as 
theme and plot, are arguably similar, the case must be submitted to the jury, 
Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, he said, in non-literary cases where the varieties of possible 
expression are more limited, a judge may be able to decide subjectively that 
one toy or video game has a different "concept and feel" from another and 
dismiss a suit without trial. 
</P>
<P>
The court also upheld Stotler's conclusion that objective characteristics of 
the two "Equalizer" characters and script could be found to have substantial 
similarities, despite some differences in detail. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's lawyer, Richard Aldrich, called the ruling a legal breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Petrich, a lawyer for the CBS and the studios and writers accused in the 
suit, did not return a telephone call.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: DES USED AGAINST MISCARRIAGES AND AS CONTRACEPTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Question: In a recent column, you described DES as a morning-after pill and 
said it was taken years ago by pregnant women. You didn't say why, leaving the 
impression that these women were trying to abort their pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
That's not true at all! Back in the 1950s we women were given DES to try to 
prevent miscarriages. I'd hate for my children -- or anyone else -- to think I 
was trying to end a pregnancy when I took DES. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You are quite right that DES (diethylstilbestrol) was prescribed from 
the 1940s through the 1960s in the hopes of preventing miscarriages. It wasn't 
prescribed as a morning-after contraceptive until the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Because you took DES during pregnancy, your daughter (if you had one) should be 
careful to get regular gynecological exams, as she may be at higher risk of 
certain cancers or ectopic pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will SOD pills sold in health food stores help arthritis and relieve pain? 
</P>
<P>
A: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is digested in the stomach and is unlikely to be 
absorbed or help arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Q: For years I suffered deep depressions. It was a nightmare, and none of the 
many medications prescribed to me really helped. 
</P>
<P>
Since I was put on Prozac my life has turned around. I feel great. Just thought 
you should have some perspective to counteract some of the bad things you have 
said about this wonderful drug. 
</P>
<P>
A. There is no doubt that Prozac (fluoxetine) has helped many people. It 
relieves depression and does not produce some of the side effects most common 
to other antidepressant medications. 
</P>
<P>
As beneficial as Prozac may be, though, some people do experience adverse 
reactions. One reader wrote to say she had to stop taking this drug due to 
"anxiety, headache, decreased appetite and concentration, weight loss, and 
terrible insomnia."

LIZ SMITH: EDDIE MURPHY TRIES AGAIN TO BE STAND-UP GUY

<TEXT>
<P>
CAN EDDIE Murphy be worried about the so-so box-office take on his last two 
movies -- "Harlem Nights" and "Another 48 HRS."? Can this former stand-up 
comic, who gained stardom on "Saturday Night Live" and was insulting women and 
gays long before we ever heard of Andrew Dice Clay, be feeling just a bit 
insecure about his status in Hollywood? Insiders say yes, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
And they speculate that is why Eddie is working hard on new stand-up routines, 
with an eye to regaining his original audience. 
</P>
<P>
But Eddie's act, which he tried out recently at New York City's Comic Strip, 
contains some slams at Sylvester Stallone that Eddie would probably say were 
all in fun. Stallone might not think so. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Murphy talks about how Sly was jealous and suspicious that Eddie 
may have romanced Sly's then-wife, Brigitte Nielsen, when the statuesque blonde 
appeared with Eddie in "Beverly Hills Cop II": "Yeah, he thought I did. Now I 
ask you, why would I want her -- she looks like a man!" 
</P>
<P>
Eddie says he didn't bother getting into a physical hassle with Stallone 
because "he's small -- he's just a itty-bitty little man. Now Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, I'd stay out of his way. He's a BIG man." 
</P>
<P>
Well, boys will be boys, but we have a feeling Sylvester, who is a much more 
interesting, articulate and mature person than his screen image suggests, might 
just laugh it off as sticks and stones and all that jazz.

SEAN PENN, the formerly pugnacious former husband of You Know Who, is preparing 
to descend on Nebraska next month to direct "Indian Runner," a film he also 
wrote. This is his debut as a director. 
</P>
<P>
"Indian Runner," a contemporary story about the Midwest, also stars Valeria 
Golino (she was Tom Cruise's fed-up girlfriend in "Rainman"), Sandy Dennis, 
David Morse and Patricia Arquette. 
</P>
<P>
Penn also has a new movie ready for release, "State of Grace," the story of the 
Westies gang war in New York. Both Sean and co-star Gary Oldman are said to be 
excellent, and the film powerful, but be forewarned: It is realistically and 
graphically violent. 
</P>
<P>
BON JOVI guitarist Richie Sambora is still hot and heavy with Cher, for whom 
youth springs eternal. In fact, it is at Richie's house in New Jersey that Cher 
has been resting her limbs during her East Coast concerts. And please discount 
rumors that put the blame for what appears to be the breakup of the band on 
Cher. 
</P>
<P>
As one insider said: "All these people are too sophisticated, smart and 
ambitious to let a personal relationship spoil a successful band. If Bon Jovi 
does break up, it has nothing to do with Cher."

Actress Katharine Hepburn and many of her neighbors are suing the town of Old 
Saybrook because of property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn and 45 neighbors in the Old Saybrook borough of Fenwick claim in a 
lawsuit against the town assessor and the Board of Tax Review that the town 
unfairly assessed their properties. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed Monday in Middletown Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, Hepburn owns three building lots in Fenwick, totaling 
about 3.5 acres, including wetlands, assessed at $1.17 million and a house 
originally assessed at $373,100. 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn appealed her tax bills to the Board of Tax Review in February and her 
house assessment was lowered to $282,100, but the board notified her in May 
that it would not reassess her land, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who answered the telephone at Hepburn's home and identified herself as 
the actress' sister-in-law, said the actress was in New York City and could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Old Saybrook tax assessor Lucille Kelley did not immediately return a telephone 
message left by The Associated Press.

The late Art Rooney, founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, was described in court 
today as a good customer of a man on trial for doing millions of dollars in 
bookmaking. 
</P>
<P>
The comment about Rooney came in opening statements at the trial of Paul 
Hankish, 58, whom the government said started running a bookmaking operation 
out of Bridgeport, Ohio, in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
"One of Hankish's partners . . . will testify that they took out-of-state bets 
over the telephone, including wagers from a Pittsburgh-based group headed by 
Art Rooney, who they code-named No. 42," U.S. Atty. William A. Kolibash wrote 
in a statement released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 42" placed bets with a Mississippi and Texas bookmaker totaling $100,000 a 
weekend, the statement said. The statement referred to several No. 42s and it 
was unclear whether it referred to Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. John Reed declined to discuss whether Rooney placed bets 
on professional football, saying they were not planning to bring any witnesses 
who would discuss Rooney's alleged betting habits. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney died in 1988 at age 87 after a stroke.

MISSOURI'S COACH DENIES GIVING FALSE MATERIAL TO NCAA PROBERS

University of Missouri Coach Norm Stewart denied today that he had provided 
false or misleading information to NCAA investigators looking into alleged 
wrongdoing in the school's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to contest the NCAA's recent allegation at every stage of the 
proceeding," Stewart said in a nine-page statement distributed before his 
Kansas City news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"During my 33 years of coaching I have never been connected with an NCAA 
rules-infraction case until this one," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said almost all the allegations in the letter of inquiry issued in May 
by the NCAA were attributable to four individuals and their families or 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one of these four individuals has publicly expressed a bias against the 
university and the coach, and each one of these individuals has a motive to 
fabricate or to at least embellish the facts," he said in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
"For several of the allegations, however, the evidence boils down to a conflict 
of testimony between disgruntled individuals, who have a motive to lie, on the 
one hand and a coaching staff on the other hand. 
</P>
<P>
"My coaching staff has been in good standing for over seven decades 
collectively," he said. "For those allegations where the evidence boils down to 
us versus them I feel the question should be resolved in favor of the coaching 
staff."

PINIELLA NOT UNDER INQUIRY, VINCENT SAYS

Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said today that his office is not 
investigating Cincinnati Reds Manager Lou Piniella, whose name surfaced in a 
published transcript of George Steinbrenner's two-day hearing on the Yankee 
owner's paying of $40,000 to gambler Howard Spira. 
</P>
<P>
The transcript, published by The National sports daily, quoted Steinbrenner as 
saying one of the reasons he gave the money to Spira was that he feared he 
would reveal information on the gambling habits of Piniella, a former Yankee 
player, manager and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked into it and there's nothing to it," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner later issued a statement clearing the Cincinnati Reds manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, the release of Mr. Steinbrenner's testimony without my approval 
or prior knowledge has caused the disclosure of the names of people who are not 
involved in my investigation," Vincent said. "Lou Piniella's name was raised by 
Mr. Steinbrenner. John Dowd subsequently interviewed Mr. Piniella, who 
cooperated fully." 
</P>
<P>
Dowd was hired by Vincent to submit a report to him on Steinbrenner's dealings 
with Spira. 
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied that Lou Piniella did not engage in any activity warranting 
further attention from my office. I regret that the public disclosure of this 
testimony had unfairly insinuated Mr. Piniella into this affair. Mr. Piniella 
is in good standing with me and my office." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Steinbrenner wrote a letter to the commissioner after the 
hearings, acknowledging that, "in hindsight, I used poor judgment in giving 
Spira the $40,000."

CONTRA DANCING TO OLD-FASHIONED 'STOMPY MUSIC' MAKES MANY FEET HAPPY

<TEXT>
<P>
A handsome, middle-aged couple are sitting in a meeting hall, pontificating 
enthusiastically about contras. 
</P>
<P>
But no mention is made of Nicaragua or the Sandinistas. These two are speaking 
of contras of a different kind -- contra dances that take place the third 
Saturday of every month at the Anaheim Cultural Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first time. My husband dragged me here," said Irvine resident 
Marcella Lowe with a grin. Warren Lowe, 60, a Customs Service inspector, made 
his contra debut the previous month and sounded as if he was on his way to 
becoming a contra convert. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to dance the Virginia reel to this sort of music back in 
Massachusetts," he said, gesturing toward the stage, where a band was playing a 
furious fiddle tune. "It's easy to pick up on these dances after you do them a 
few times." 
</P>
<P>
She seemed eager to hit the dance floor: "This music has a different beat from 
square-dancing music. We used to call this 'stompy music' -- the stuff you like 
to pat your feet to." 
</P>
<P>
Contra dancing, according to Richard Nevell's book "A Time to Dance," is a 
distant cousin of Morris dancing, an ancient ceremonial activity performed by 
men in England to encourage fruitful crops. As the dance evolved, it became 
more of a social function involving both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
Early settlers of New England brought the dances with them to this continent. 
By the late 18th Century, the French, a dominant force in dance at the time, 
renamed this "country dancing" contredanse, which English-speakers later 
adapted to "contra." 
</P>
<P>
The term also refers to the position of dancing opposite a partner. Instead of 
dancers interacting in groups of eight, as is common in square dancing, contra 
dancers line people up in two long rows. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Russell is the main organizer of these Anaheim dances. Long before any 
happy-footed folk show up to test the floor, Russell stands in the middle of 
the small hall, checking the sound system for the Occasional String Band 
quintet, in which she plays guitar, bass and, sometimes, French accordion. The 
56-year-old Garden Grove resident cuts a casual figure in wheat-colored slacks, 
black blouse and Birkenstock sandals as she shouts directions over the music to 
adjust the level of various instruments and microphones. Once satisfied with 
the sonic levels, Russell took a break in a quiet back room and talked about 
exactly what makes these dances worth the effort it takes to set them up and 
keep them running. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born on a farm in North Dakota and was raised around old-time music. As 
a 5-year-old, I was taken to some of the last authentic country dances in the 
area," she explained, speaking softly now that she didn't have to shout over 
amplified music. 
</P>
<P>
"Those dances were held in school auditoriums, with benches all around the 
sides and lots of coats and overshoes and grandmas and little kids. A fiddler 
came down from Canada, usually." 
</P>
<P>
Russell's fascination with music began at a tender age. She got a ukulele when 
she was 6, a guitar for Christmas when she was 10 and picked up other 
instruments from there. Now, she is such a music aficionado that she also plays 
guitar in the Louisiana Cajun Trio and a zydeco band. 
</P>
<P>
She has been plucking tunes with Occasional String Band-mates Carty Wilson and 
Hugh Nestor since the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been gathering to play music in living rooms forever, it seemed," 
Russell said. "Out of that group of people playing together, the idea of having 
dancing developed. My husband and I had a covered, sheltered patio in our yard 
in Garden Grove, and put on a dance there for five years, until 1987." 
</P>
<P>
That's when city officials put a halt to the informal gatherings because 
Russell did not have an entertainment permit. 
</P>
<P>
Once the band decided that the dancers and the musicians deserved "to build a 
good dance, as opposed to a fun thing that ultimately wouldn't go anywhere," 
Russell said, they moved the contra first to Huntington Beach, then in late 
1988 to its current location. A labor of love more than a moneymaking venture, 
this monthly contra draws 30 to 50 dancers per night -- just enough, at $4 per 
adult admission, to cover rental fees for the hall. 
</P>
<P>
(Seven monthly contra dances in the Los Angeles-Orange County area are listed 
in the California Dance Co-Operative bulletin, which promises "No partner or 
experience necessary. All dances taught and prompted.") 
</P>
<P>
The live music, Russell said, is a vital ingredient of contra dances. 
</P>
<P>
"This music has a way of reminding us of people we love," she said. "My 
grandfather and great uncles played various instruments at local dances in 
North Dakota and in a small-town band that was something straight out of 'The 
Music Man.' Maybe this music gives us those people and those times back, when 
people were more of a community, dependent upon each other in real ways. You'll 
find strangers talking to each other at this dance and that sense of 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Music that emanates from a live band instead of a record player also sets 
contra dancing apart from square-dancing, Russell added. 
</P>
<P>
"There's very little square-dancing that I know of, at least in Southern 
California, that's done to live music. I think square-dancers are more into 
developing precision moves and good-looking things out on the dance floor. 
Maybe there are people who get more pleasure out of precision. But this music 
is more loose and forgiving." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Russell rejoins the band on stage, most of the potluck supper 
dishes brought by dancers have been polished off and folks are out on the 
scuffed wooden floor, following the patient instructions of caller Wayne 
Battleson as he explains the steps of the first dance. With his long brown 
ponytail and cordless headset microphone, Battleson looks like he might be more 
at home fronting a heavy-metal band than explaining do-si-dos. 
</P>
<P>
But it's obvious that he has a way with contra clarification. Even the 
beginners out on the floor learn very quickly how to differentiate between 
"active" and "inactive," "top" and "bottom" couples. Before they know it, they 
have graduated to sashays and balances, stars and courtesy turns. 
</P>
<P>
Then the band strikes up, and it's time to put the newly acquired terminology 
into action. Joining the band on stage are a couple of musicians who are 
sitting in. That too, Russell said, is a part of the contra dance tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who wants to can come up and play on stage with us, but whether or not 
they'll be on microphone is another matter," she said. "The group spirit is the 
pervasive idea." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is quite a mix of ethnic backgrounds, ages and fashion styles 
out on the floor. One dancer who looks to be about 12 is swinging his partner 
with the best of them in high-top tennis shoes and a pink shirt stamped Off 
Limits. But the youngest participant is 15-month-old David Blair. He giggles 
with every bounce as his mother, Zona, balances him on one hip and gamely 
extends her free hand to various partners up and down the line. A few dancers 
zip through the steps with no-nonsense looks on their faces, but most looked 
relaxed and smile frequently, taking time to make funny faces at little David. 
</P>
<P>
Battleson's calls are easy to follow, but when someone loses the way, there are 
usually arms reaching out to help errant dancers back into proper position 
before they reel entirely out of control. The quick, rhythmic clasping of hands 
and synchronized negotiation of turns can be strangely thrilling -- perhaps a 
bit like trapeze work, with just a fraction of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Shapin, 59, a lawyer from Orange, has been coming to the Anaheim dance 
since its early days. "I like the sociability of contra dancing -- the way you 
dance all up and down the lines," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Ted, a 62-year-old engineer, said the Shapins' daughter recently 
participated in a "dance friendship exchange" in the Soviet Union. "They 
brought their own band and caller and taught the Soviets how to contra," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a sea of pastel summer clothes, Shannon Batts' black miniskirt and boots and 
Steve Jackson's skull-print pants and fedora make them stand out in the crowd 
of dancers. Yet they too are contra veterans -- and regard themselves as the 
resident jesters as well, always stirring up mischief even as they execute 
steps skillfully. Jackson frequently punctuated the beat of the banjo music 
with a tweet on a whistle, and he and Batts led all the dancers in shouts of 
"lemonade!" to rhyme with the caller's command of "promenade." 
</P>
<P>
"I got into dancing because I wanted to have a chance to play and use my body 
and have a release after sitting around and being intellectual all day," said 
Jackson, 30, a Census Bureau edit clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular dance is different from all the other contras I know," said 
Batts, 26, a psychiatric aide and a graduate student in the counseling program 
at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"This dance is very community-oriented," she said. "We bring out food and 
flowers and children. The other dances aren't like that. (Those) are just three 
hours of hard-core dancing." 
</P>
<P>
During the band's break, a couple of the musicians strolled over to a reporter 
to offer a cup of lemonade and a quick tutorial about the "old-time" music they 
play at contras. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a good tune that allows you to follow the dance throughout," said Ira 
Gwin, 49, director of community development for the City of Commerce when he is 
not the main fiddle man in several bands. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be able to sense through the music what the next dance move should 
be," banjo player Jack Phillips elaborated. "We play a Southern Mountain 
Appalachian style of dance music, which is different from the New England 
style. They do a lot more jigs in six-eight time." 
</P>
<P>
Carty Wilson, a mandolin player from Long Beach, stressed that the music this 
band plays at contras is very different from bluegrass. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we're trying to do here is to perpetuate the older style of 
music," he said. "Bluegrass is a flashy style primarily for performance. This 
style of music is pre-bluegrass." 
</P>
<P>
By 11:30 p.m., the lemonade jug was drained and all but the most die-hard 
dancers were tuckered out. Even the energetic children, who spent their contra 
time skipping rope and playing tag on the sidelines, were flagging. Some 
dancers helpfully dragged folding chairs into place for the youth theater group 
that would take over the hall the next day. Others made their way out the door 
slowly, picking up jelly jars full of dark brown honey that fiddle player Gwin 
had harvested from his bees. 
</P>
<P>
Caller Battleson, a land-surveyor in his non-dancing time, offered the 
evening's final opinion on why a quaint little activity like contra dancing is 
thriving in the shadow of the Matterhorn and other more glitzy entertainment 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's vigorous, flirtatious, social and a way to have a fun time without going 
out to the bars," he said. "And the people are just tremendous. You meet the 
best people contra dancing." 
</P>
<P>
