THREE-POINT PROGRAM PUTS THE BITE ON FLEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The sign in a West Hollywood pet supply store says it all: "THEY'RE BACK." The 
subject matter isn't poltergeists. It's fleas, those nasty critters that invade 
Southern California homes and yards every summer, causing animals and owners to 
itch and scratch. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny black insects -- which are so acrobatic that they can jump 8 inches 
vertically or 13 inches horizontally -- seem to be everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, in Southern California, the pests never really go away. In winter, 
fleas are in a dormant stage. But by summer, they can reach near-epidemic form, 
when the temperatures and humidity are higher. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about fleas in California is that they're year-round," said Dr. 
Wayne Rosenkrantz, a Garden Grove veterinarian and member of the American 
College of Veterinary Dermatology. "Fleas grow best with 75% humidity and 80 
degrees. Those are the major things that influence their growth. In wintertime, 
when it gets more arid and the humidity is below 30% or 40%, they don't like 
it. In summer, they grow fast in all the heat and humidity." 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians estimate that female fleas can lay from three to 20 eggs a day, 
about 3,000-4,000 eggs in a lifetime; the eggs can hatch anywhere and produce 
an adult flea in 10-14 days. Eggs also can remain viable for up to a year, 
which explains why people with no pets have moved into empty apartments or 
houses and ended up with flea infestations from a previous owner's animal, 
Rosenkrantz said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in for a bad summer," Dr. Martin Small of the Animal Hospital in Burbank 
said recently of the flea problem. "We're way ahead in the numbers of dogs and 
cats coming in with skin problems and allergies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Covering the Territory 
</P>
<P>
What to do about fleas? Don't just spray or powder, shampoo or flea dip those 
cats and dogs. Fleas also live in your house and yard. "To adequately control 
fleas, you have to treat all the pets in the environment, not just the ones 
that are scratching," Rosenkrantz advised. "The ones scratching are having an 
allergic, hypersensitive reaction." 
</P>
<P>
Most veterinarians and pet store personnel recommend a three-part program -- 
spraying the yard with an insecticide designed to kill fleas and ticks; bombing 
the house with commercial bombs or calling in a professional exterminator; and 
taking your cat or dog to the vet for a bath and flea dip or shampooing and 
dipping the animal yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Most commercial flea remedies work if properly administered, veterinarians say. 
But be sure to read the directions carefully and follow them. Remember, the 
products contain chemicals that can cause toxic reactions in you or your pet. 
</P>
<P>
Yard sprays with malathion -- the chemical used in Los Angeles to combat 
Medflies -- or diazinone are relatively safe, many veterinarians believe. It 
seems best to use a lighter application more often. And now on the market is a 
time-released yard spray, advertised to release chemicals daily to keep after 
the flea population. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alfred Plechner, a veterinarian at California Animal Hospital in West Los 
Angeles who specializes in pet allergies and nutrition, recommends that clients 
with flea infestations spray their yards three times at 10-day intervals. "That 
usually sets them back pretty well and will contain them," he said. "But you 
have to get rid of them in the house and on the dog or cat at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
In his prevention program, he tells owners to start yard spraying in the 
spring, when fleas come out of the inactive stage, then to spray in mid-summer 
and in the fall. At each spraying, he advises, "wait an hour then water 
everything to the roots." You may get better results by spraying after sunset 
as the hot sun evaporates the spray more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Plechner said he believes that controlling fleas "takes a whole bunch of 
prevention. People let things go until they have a major problem. Most of it is 
just common sense and caring enough for your animals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bombs and Sprays 
</P>
<P>
He and other veterinarians favor indoor flea bombs and sprays with the generic 
chemical metheprine, which stops development of flea larvae into eggs; to kill 
adult fleas, use products with the chemical compounds called pyrethrins or 
pyrethroids. "The trend is to switch to pyrethrins," Rosenkrantz said. "They're 
generally considered safer types of insecticides." 
</P>
<P>
When spraying or powdering pets, be careful not to overuse products or the 
animals can have adverse reactions. Don't use shampoos, sprays or dips 
recommended for dogs on cats and vice versa. If you have flea problems with a 
kitten, puppy or an older cat or dog, it might be wise to check with a 
veterinarian before spraying or dipping. The chemicals could be too harsh for 
these animals. 
</P>
<P>
For very young or older animals, consider using a steel flea comb with teeth so 
close together they can catch the insects. Then dip the comb in hot water and 
detergent or in rubbing alcohol. "Combs do wonders and they also aren't harming 
the pet," said Lenny Rapps of the West Hollywood Pet Department store. "You 
also can fill a dog's bed with cedar chips. Fleas aren't crazy about cedar." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenkrantz recommends "some type of dip" for dogs once a week if they have 
flea problems. "Cats, on the other hand, are real sensitive to flea products, 
so you have to be very careful with them." 
</P>
<P>
Rapps warned: "If your cat starts drooling or foaming at the mouth, you've put 
too much on. Wash it off right away and take the cat to the vet." 
</P>
<P>
Many veterinarians downplay the effectiveness of chemical or natural-ingredient 
flea collars (natural models use citronella or eucalyptus). Some say they don't 
work at all; others say the collars work on some animals but only to keep fleas 
off their head and neck. And what of the high-tech collars that produce 
ultrasonic sound that supposedly drives away fleas? "I'd say they work 10% of 
the time from what clients who've tried them say," Plechner said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Natural Remedies 
</P>
<P>
Most veterinarians don't think much of natural remedies such as feeding pets 
garlic, Brewer's yeast or vitamin B. They caution that natural and chemical 
products can produce skin allergies in animals, showing up in symptoms such as 
skin redness, scaling and hair loss. 
</P>
<P>
If you're searching for nontoxic, flea-fighting pet shampoos for your dog, 
Plechner recommends low-suds Amway soap or Head &amp; Shoulders dandruff 
shampoo, which he said "knocks . . . out fleas. Nobody tells people the more 
baths -- not flea baths but just baths -- the merrier to keep fleas off."

TOP DESIGNERS FLAUNT FLAG, CREATE FLAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a synchronized burst of patriotism, several top designers made the American 
flag a theme in their fall collections. But just as the clothes are being 
delivered to stores this week, the recent Supreme Court ruling that protects 
flag burning as a legal form of free speech has turned Old Glory into a 
political hot potato. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts gather for hearings on Capitol Hill while designer Ralph Lauren 
poses in his new Polo ad, wearing a sweater with stars and stripes emblazoned 
on the front. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Jacobs, who designs the Perry Ellis collection, is showing his flag-motif 
fashions in Chicago this week, with a high flying, $2,400 cashmere shawl as the 
centerpiece. There are more stars and stripes on his pink-and-white, sequined 
evening dresses. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, avant-garde designers Bruno Duluc and Douglas Thompson 
introduced flag images in their red, white and blue "election collection," of 
stretchy fabric shaped by wires and hoops. 
</P>
<P>
With so many Americans fired up about flag burning, where does that leave flag 
wearing? 
</P>
<P>
"Caught in a double standard," says ABC newsman Sam Donaldson, who recently 
discussed the issue on "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
"The super patriots think the flag is a sacred symbol of our country and 
believe it should be inviolate. By their standards, wearing it is a 
desecration." 
</P>
<P>
But the right to use the flag in protest is also protected by the First 
Amendment, which is also inviolate. This side of the argument, Donaldson says, 
has more than a few experts agreeing: "The issue is a can of worms." 
</P>
<P>
He adds: "As distasteful and repugnant as flag burning is, I think the Supreme 
Court was correct in its decision." 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that where you wear the flag is significant. Across your heart, as 
in Lauren's sweater, doesn't seem like a desecration. Across the fanny of your 
faded blue jeans does, to many people. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between what is political and what is patriotic is one of 
degrees," Donaldson notes. 
</P>
<P>
For designer Marc Jacobs, the stars and stripes are an artistic expression. 
</P>
<P>
"Marc used the flag from a Jasper Johns painting," explains the designer's 
spokeswoman, Laura O'Brien. In her opinion, "It's an art piece, not a national 
symbol." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slings and Arrows 
</P>
<P>
So far, retailers aren't showing any signs of political hedging. 
</P>
<P>
Bergdorf Goodman will fill the New York store windows with Marc Jacobs' 
flag-waving clothes next week. 
</P>
<P>
Hiding behind the "art" label, however, isn't likely to shelter Jacobs from the 
slings and arrows of some patriots. It's a lesson Chicago-based artist Scott 
Tyler learned last winter when he placed an American flag on the floor at the 
Art Institute of Chicago's student show. The uproar by veterans was deafening. 
</P>
<P>
Duluc, a native of France, and Thompson, his American partner, say they 
consider the flag a dynamic design with a very positive image. They fashioned 
it into surreal-shaped garments in bold shades of red, white and blue for 
patriotic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a futuristic image of Miss Liberty," Duluc said. "It made sense to 
use the symbol of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the '60s when designers worked the flag into fashion as a political 
protest, designers now are flaunting the image with old-fashioned pride. It is 
too soon in the season to predict whether consumers will buy the idea.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
JACKSON HITS HOMER IN RETURN AS ROYALS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Jackson, returning after missing five games because of a thigh injury, hit a 
435-foot home run and drove in five runs to lead the Kansas City Royals to a 
9-4 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers Tuesday night at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
It was Jackson's 22nd home run of the season, and if the Royals have a chance 
to overtake the Angels and the Oakland Athletics in the American League West, 
they will need Jackson's power. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City also will need a healthy George Brett, who has recovered from torn 
knee ligaments suffered while playing on artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
Brett's hitting is making it easier for Jackson to get good pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Brett had three hits, scored four runs and drove in two in the victory that 
kept the Royals only 2 games behind the two leaders in the West. Every time 
Jackson batted Tuesday night, Brett was on base. 
</P>
<P>
When Jackson was out, it was Brett who kept the Royals from losing. 
</P>
<P>
Brett failed to get an invitation to the All-Star game for the first time since 
1975, his second major league season, but immediately after the break went on a 
hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
In his last seven games, Brett is 13 for 26, has scored 11 runs, hit three home 
runs and driven in 10 runs. He has raised his average 30 points to .268. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came off the field after hurting the knee, I said, 'You can take this 
turf and stuff it,' " and vowed never to play on artificial turf again. 
</P>
<P>
"I had time to sit around and think. What can I do to get away from this stuff? 
I still have four years left on my contract. (two years guaranteed). 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried using plastic spikes, instead of metal, but that didn't do any 
good. The last injury came when my spikes caught as I tried to throw the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 4, Seattle 3 -- There is a tight race in the West, but in the East, 
the surprising Orioles go merrily on their way. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Worthington, who has given the Orioles a regular third baseman for the 
first time in years, delivered the big punch for their fifth consecutive 
victory in this game at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Worthington hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning to give Jeff Ballard 
(11-4) a 4-1 lead and four relievers held off the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles lead the Yankees by 7 1/2 games and Toronto by 8 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 7, Detroit 2 -- Dave Beard, trying to make a comeback, fooled Dave 
Parker the first time he faced him. 
</P>
<P>
But when Beard (0-1), making his first major league appearance since 1985, 
tried to do it again, he got the ball up and Parker hammered a three-run home 
run at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The home run gave Storm Davis (8-4), who combined with three relievers for a 
four-hitter, the victory. Davis, who needed help in the seventh, is 5-1 since 
coming off the disabled list June 10. Dennis Eckersley pitched a hitless ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The A's Jose Canseco did not play. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5, Cleveland 4 -- In a league that uses the designated hitter, a 
pitcher can trail, 4-2, in the seventh and stay around. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Viola (8-10) did that at Minneapolis and wound up with a career-tying 
best of 11 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dwyer's short sacrifice fly scored Gene Larkin with the winning run in the 
ninth. Larkin was on with his fifth hit. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 8, Boston 1 -- In a matchup of probably the two hardest throwers in the 
American League at Arlington, Tex., Bobby Witt outpitched Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
Witt pitched a two-hitter and, though he walked six, had eight strikeouts for 
his third complete game and an 8-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens, 4-1 with an ERA of 2.10 in eight previous starts at Arlington Stadium, 
allowed eight hits and eight runs and walked seven in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
New York at Chicago -- -- The White Sox, going for their sixth in a row, were 
stopped by rain at Chicago. They were leading, 2-1, and still batting in the 
first inning when a rainstorm ended the game. DAN HAFNER

DODGERS REVERT TO STRENGTH AS HERSHISER STYMIES THE CUBS, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a few hours after they made a move to strengthen their offense, acquiring 
Kal Daniels in a trade with the Cincinnati Reds, the Dodgers again showed that 
they are not lacking in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Most notably, they got another strong pitching performance from Orel Hershiser, 
who gave up only four hits Tuesday night in a 4-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs 
before 37,543 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, winning for the second time since the All-Star break to improve to 
11-7, finished his fifth complete game by giving up only two hits in the last 
eight innings, facing only three batters over the minimum after the Cubs sent 
six batters to the plate in the first inning. He struck out five and walked 
none. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, whose status was in doubt as late as Monday because of a stomach 
virus, needed only 98 pitches and said he never felt tired. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting ahead of the hitters, and when they're behind, they've got to 
get their bats moving early," he said in a radio interview. "And so, I got a 
lot of outs early in the count." 
</P>
<P>
All of the Cubs' hits were singles, and none left the infield. 
</P>
<P>
"When he's hitting the spots, he's tough," said Lloyd McClendon, who was one 
for four. "His ball moves a lot." 
</P>
<P>
What moved Hershiser was a Dodger uprising in the fifth and sixth innings, when 
they bunched six hits, including a two-run fifth-inning double by the slumping 
Kirk Gibson, to score all of their runs. 
</P>
<P>
"When we score -- that's the most exciting time for me," said Hershiser, who 
has been a victim of the Dodgers' dormant offense this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored all of their runs against Cub starter Greg Maddux, who had 
given up only eight earned runs in his previous six starts and had won eight of 
his previous 10 starts, including three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux had not lost in three previous decisions against the Dodgers, including 
a 1-0 victory over Hershiser on April 27 at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs gave Maddux a 1-0 lead in the first inning after Ryne Sandberg reached 
safely on a one-out error by Dodger third baseman Jeff Hamilton, whose errant 
throw skipped past first baseman Eddie Murray. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, Mark Grace singled through the right side, extending his hitting 
streak to eight games and sending Sandberg to third base. Moments later, Grace 
ducked under a line drive by catcher Damon Berryhill, whose single to right 
field scored Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux sailed into the fifth, which started on a bad note for the Cubs, Maddux 
hitting Mike Scioscia with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
After Scioscia was sacrificed to second, Alfredo Griffin stretched a single 
through the left side into a double. He took the extra base when left fielder 
McClendon inexplicably threw to cutoff man Shawon Dunston, who was stationed 
near the mound, instead of Sandberg, who covered second. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, hitless in his previous 11 at-bats, followed with a two-run double, 
slicing a 3-and-2 pitch into the left-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Dodgers a 2-1 lead, and they might have had more if not for a 
baserunning error by Gibson, who moved to second when Murray was intentionally 
walked and was running on the pitch when Mike Marshall bounced a grounder 
toward the hole between shortstop and third base. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson rounded third and charged toward home, but Dunston back-handed the ball 
in the hole and easily threw out Gibson at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, however, the Dodgers increased their lead after getting a leadoff 
double from Franklin Stubbs, whose fly ball kicked up dirt on the warning track 
and bounced off the wall in left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs moved to third on a groundout by Hamilton and scored on a single by 
Scioscia, whose sharp grounder bounced off the right arm of Grace, the Cub 
first baseman, and into right field. 
</P>
<P>
After Hershiser sacrificed him to second, Scioscia scored on a double by 
Griffin. Griffin bounced a line drive in front of a diving Gary Varsho, the Cub 
right fielder, who was unable to come up with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger lead was 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser continued to beguile the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of fun to pitch that well," he said. "I haven't pitched that well 
in my last three or four starts." 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia, he said, deserved at least part of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
"I only shook him off twice," Hershiser said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Said pitcher Ramon Martinez, who gave up three runs and three hits in six 
innings Monday night in his second start of the season and first since being 
called up Sunday from the Dodgers' triple-A affiliate at Albuquerque, N.M.: "I 
think I pitched very good, except for one pitch." Martinez, who was not 
involved in the decision in a 6-3 Dodger loss, served up a first-inning 
fastball down the middle to Mark Grace, whose three-run home run gave the Cubs 
a 3-0 lead. . . . The starting time for the Dodgers' game against the San 
Francisco Giants Aug. 1 at Dodger Stadium has been changed to 5:20 p.m. to 
accommodate NBC, which will televise the game nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson had not driven in more than one run in a game since June 26, when 
he had two RBIs against the Cincinnati Reds.

FISH REPORT: TWO BIG STRIPERS CAUGHT AT RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bullhead City, on the Arizona side of the Colorado River, is known for yielding 
small striped bass, but two local residents recently proved that big stripers 
can be caught there as well. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Cherry landed a 34-pound striper while Michael Gaskewy caught a 
25-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Striped bass best in lower basin. Anchovies working at 40-70 feet. 
Some surface action in Vegas Wash. Fish from two to nine pounds. Catfish -- 
most under three pounds -- biting in coves in evenings. Largemouth bass slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE HAVASU -- Stripers biting on surface lures throughout lake, the larger 
fish, to six pounds, biting in mornings off points or in river. Anchovies at 
45. Largemouth bass slow, best in mornings and evenings. Catfish picking up, 
averaging two- to five pounds, biting best in deep water. Most baits working. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Striped bass bite very good in river. Trout also biting on 
river, with Berkley Power Bait working best. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Orangemouth corvina best at Red Hill, but good catches at Bombay 
and Niland marina. Live baits best bet. Croaker good on west and north ends. 
Flathead catfish upwards of 30 pounds biting in Alamo River. Heavy tackle 
necessary due to strong current. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Trout providing most action, biting at dam. Trollers using 
seven colors and needlefish lure. Yellow Power Bait, cheese and nightcrawlers. 
Crappie picking up, biting best at Jackrabbit Flats on red and white mini-jigs. 
Catfish biting best in backs of bays in shallows. Mackerel best bet. Red ear 
perch fair. Tony Burke, 12, Ojai, 3-8 perch (new lake record). 
</P>
<P>
CASITAS LAKE -- Catfish biting in shallows, with mackerel working best. George 
Collier, Oxnard, six catfish, 35 pounds. Trout biting at 40 feet, some to 2 1/2 
pounds. Most baits working. Largemouth bass slow. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Striped bass biting on surface, mainly in marina and channel.

SPORT BOATS RECORD FIRST CATCHES OF ALBACORE OFF BAJA CALIFORNIA COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pete Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first sport catches of albacore have been recorded after medium-range boats 
from San Diego's sportfishing fleet, eager to save what has been fast turning 
into a dismal season, converged on the area where a commercial bait boat 
reported catching eight of the popular tuna last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Molly N, a commercial bait boat en route to Cabo San Lucas, discovered the 
fish last Friday while passing through an area 200 miles southeast of San Diego 
and 50 miles offshore. Since then, San Diego boats making three- and five-day 
runs to the area have posted some impressive numbers: 
</P>
<P>
The Vagabond, arriving on the scene Friday and reportedly fishing with only two 
paying customers, caught 19 albacore. The Searcher, which had been on an 
exploratory run 200 miles southwest of San Diego when skipper Art Taylor heard 
of the Molly N's findings closer to shore, raced to the area, where its 
customers caught 98 albacore Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Polaris Supreme reported catching 155 and the Royal Star 77. 
</P>
<P>
All of the fish weighed between six and 10 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much going on this morning," Carol Sandner of H&amp;M Landing said 
Tuesday. "But that's because boats are leaving and traveling (to the area)." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Dotson of the National Marine Fisheries Service said last week that water 
conditions are favorable and said he saw no reason to believe the fish wouldn't 
migrate farther north, which is what they generally do if conditions allow. 
</P>
<P>
Sportfishing for albacore has been extremely poor during the last three years 
and the fleet has had to rely on the yellowtail bite at the nearby Coronado 
Islands and the late-summer tuna bite offshore to pay its bills. This year, 
after a sizzling start, the yellowtail bite has shut off, leaving the fleet 
scrambling after any bit of good news it can find. 
</P>
<P>
Baja fishing: Conditions have vastly improved off Cabo San Lucas after recent 
tropical depressions pushed clear blue water "right into the harbor," said 
Didier Van Der Veeken of the International Game Fish Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Van Der Veeken said the best fishing is five miles offshore, with sailfish, 
striped marlin, dorado and yellowfin tuna common sights at the scales. 
</P>
<P>
As for billfish, anglers aboard hotel boats are averaging between two and five 
hookups a day. The prized blue marlin, however, are still about 10 miles 
offshore, but are expected to move closer with the warmer water, already more 
than 80 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north in the east cape region, the Hotel Spa Buena Vista reports a wide 
open bite for striped marlin, sailfish and dorado. Richard Castaneda, a 
representative of the hotel, calls the bite "the best in recent years," with 
some boats reporting between eight and 20 billfish a day. 
</P>
<P>
Blue marlin have shown and there have been unconfirmed reports of an 
800-pounder being caught last week slightly offshore, and a confirmed catch of 
a 425-pound blue. 
</P>
<P>
"Some fishermen are returning to the beach by noon exhausted from catching so 
many fish," Castaneda said. 
</P>
<P>
One of those fish was a 76-pound dorado caught by Richard Wagner of Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
At the Midriff region of the Sea of Cortez, the water has warmed to 86 degrees 
and the yellowtail are averaging more than 20 pounds at the north end of Smith 
Island, according to Ken Stewart of Sportsman's Caravans. Stewart said bigger 
yellowtail, including one 48-pounder, are being caught at La Guardia Island. 
Dorado have moved into the area and a few sailfish have been seen. Cabrilla and 
grouper make up the rest of the catches. 
</P>
<P>
Talking turkey: Missouri's turkey hunters shot a record 35,688 turkeys during a 
two-week season that ended May 7, but not without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Denton, the chairman of the National Wild Turkey Federation's board of 
directors, was slightly injured while hunting turkey in Texas County, Mo., by a 
man who thought he saw a turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Denton was sitting at the base of a tree making a turkey call. When he didn't 
get a response he stood up, and was hit, "luckily by the edge of the pattern 
(of the shotgun blast)," he told Turkey Call Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, in Benton County, Mo., Mark Grenoble of Warsaw, Mo., was shot in 
the neck and face by a man who, he said, "saw the white of my face and thought 
it was a turkey." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Grenoble, an outdoor writer from Altoona, Mo., was hunting in Huntingdon 
County near Raystown Lake when she was reportedly stalked and shot several 
times by two brothers from about 35 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
Having mistaken her for game, one of the men shot her in the face, then, 
according to reports, continued to fire as she screamed and tried to crawl 
away. 
</P>
<P>
The two men later helped the woman, who escaped life-threatening or blinding 
injuries, to a nearby road to await assistance. 
</P>
<P>
She, too, had been calling turkeys, when, seeing the two men approaching, 
decided to stand. An editor's note in Turkey Call, which reported the above 
incidents, cited the National Safety Council and National Center for Health 
Statistics when it reported: 
</P>
<P>
"Consider that, per 100,000 persons in the U.S., motor vehicles take 34 lives 
annually and home accidents 13. The list went down the line until it mentioned 
that firearms accidents take just one life per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
There were no fatalities during the two-week season, the magazine said. And the 
21 non-fatal accidents were down from the previous year, when one person was 
killed hunting turkey and 28 injured. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
Capsized and sunk during the fierce January storms of 1988, the City of 
Redondo, one of the Southland's most historic and popular half-day party boats, 
is renovated and back in business at Redondo Sportfishing. . . . Stage 1 fire 
restrictions are in effect in the Angeles National Forest, which means 
campfires are restricted to developed, drive-in campgrounds with stoves or 
barbecues. Portable stoves can be used only with permits. . . . John Bedwell of 
Stockton caught an accumulated total of 42 pounds, 9 ounces of largemouth bass 
to win this month's West Coast Bass-Las Vegas Open at Lake Mead. Bedford's 
catch during the three-day period was worth $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
The new South Coast Chapter of Trout Unlimited will hold a pretrip meeting 
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at the California Youth Center in Corona del Mar. Topic 
will be a conservation project to stop the spoiling of Fish Creek -- considered 
a key a golden trout habitat -- on the Kern Plateau in the Sequoia National 
Forest. The group is seeking volunteers for the Labor Day weekend project and 
asks those interested to contact Brian Botham at (714) 846-7608. 
</P>
<P>
The Sixth Annual Longcasting National Championship will be held July 25 at 5 
p.m. at the Sahara Country Club in Las Vegas. . . . For the record: In The 
Times' Monday feature on Bahia de los Angeles, the location of Ken Stewart's 
camp was incorrect. It is 10 miles north of town.

BURWELL SELECTED TO PLAY IN SHRINE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sean Burwell, a standout as a running back and defensive back at Cleveland High 
last fall, has been added to the South team for the Shrine all-star football 
game at the Rose Bowl on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
Burwell (6-0, 185), who will attend Oregon in the fall on scholarship, was an 
All-Valley selection as a defensive back and was named the West Valley League's 
defensive MVP last year. He also rushed for 1,145 yards and became one of the 
few area players to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season at two schools. 
He gained 1,211 yards as a sophomore at Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
Burwell joins five other Valley-area players on the South team. Also selected 
are: tight end Brian Allen of Hart who will attend UCLA, lineman Rick McCathron 
(Thousand Oaks, Oregon State), linebacker Carrick O'Quinn (Agoura, UCLA), 
quarterback Ron Redell (Crespi, Stanford) and running back Russell White 
(Crespi, Cal).

MOUNTAIN CYCLISTS DEFEND SAFETY RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Jeff Meyers' otherwise fine article on Sycamore Canyon on July 7, he claims 
that hikers are gravely threatened by mountain bicyclists who have no regard 
for safety. This characterization and the quote from Ranger Brit Horn asserting 
that there have been accidents and lawsuits involving bicyclists are the only 
mention of bicyclists in the article. This is a one-sided view of mountain bike 
use. 
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that bicyclists are legitimate users of fire roads in 
Sycamore Canyon; that the vast majority of bicyclists ride carefully with high 
regard for the safety of other users; that CORBA's (Concerned Off-Road 
Bicyclists Assn.) volunteer Mountain Bike Patrol works closely with the state 
parks to monitor and regulate bicycle use in Sycamore Canyon; and that, to our 
knowledge, there are no lawsuits involving "bikes running into and over people 
in the hills." 
</P>
<P>
Mountain bicycling, like hiking, allows one to experience the wonder and the 
beauty of the backcountry. Bicycles are human scale, have negligible 
environmental impact, and can be ridden safely and responsibly in multi-user 
settings like Sycamore. My group, the Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Assn., has 
been working hard to educate all backcountry users in the appropriate use of 
bicycles, and these efforts have often received positive coverage in The Times. 
Meyers' focus on the negative case is frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain bicycle use in the state parks has raised some difficult recreational 
conflict issues, and unfounded claims and sweeping generalizations are 
particularly troublesome in this point in time as the state parks formulate new 
policy. To characterize all bicyclists by the few who ride irresponsibly is 
like characterizing all hikers by the few who smoke cigarettes on Sycamore's 
tinder-dry trails. In both cases, reckless and dangerous behavior threatens all 
users; in both cases, education and enforcement are the solution to this 
problem; and in both cases, this behavior should not reflect on the large 
numbers of responsible users.

CSUN STUDIES REPORT ON CAMPUS ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge might announce as early as Friday the results of a 
feasibility study on an on-campus, indoor sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
The report could result in a cooperative venture between the school and the 
Ogden Corp., a New York-based conglomerate that has been gathering data on the 
proposed facility for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Kato, executive assistant to Elliott Mininberg, a CSUN vice president, 
said Tuesday that the school had received a detailed report from Ogden on 
Monday and might respond publicly to its findings by the end of the week.

HERRICK ESTABLISHED CLEVELAND TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While visiting friends in the San Fernando Valley recently, I followed the 
hiring of Marc Paez as the new basketball coach at Cleveland High with great 
interest. As an alumnus and a member of the 1981 City Section 3-A champion 
Cavalier basketball team, I find it interesting that your staff writers give 
Bob Braswell credit for "establishing one of the most highly regarded programs 
in the state." 
</P>
<P>
Bob did a fine job at Cleveland and should be given credit for his efforts. It 
was, however, Coach Greg Herrick who built and developed the Cleveland 
basketball program to its present status as a prep power. Coach Herrick was the 
guiding force behind the success of Bob Braswell, and Bob maintained the fine 
tradition that Coach Herrick left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Herrick taught me many things in the two years that I played for him and 
he has likewise positively influenced many other young men in his years at 
Cleveland -- including Bob Braswell. Give "Braz" his due, but when you talk 
about the establishment of the Cleveland dynasty, all credit should be laid at 
the feet of my coach -- Greg Herrick.

SAN DIEGO EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gen-Probe, a San Diego-based biotechnology company that manufactures DNA-probe 
diagnostic products, reported a loss of $1.3 million on revenue of $2.4 
million, an improvement from the loss of $2.1 million on revenue of $1.5 
million in second-quarter 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Gen-Probe also said that its product sales improved to $1.2 million during the 
quarter from $827,000 in the same period last year. The rest of Gen-Probe's 
revenue came principally from contract research. The company sells diagnostic 
products for a variety of diseases, including tests for gonorrhea and 
chlamydia, two widespread venereal diseases. 
</P>
<P>
At its annual meeting Tuesday, Gen-Probe also announced that chief scientist 
David Kohne, who resigned last month, has rejoined the company in his former 
capacity and that he is likely to be named shortly to Gen-Probe's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months ended June 30, Gen-Probe's loss stood at $3 million on 
revenue of $4.6 million, contrasted with a loss of $4.3 million on revenue of 
$2.5 million over the same six months last year.

quarter on a revenue gain of 11% to $1.122 billion. The company said the 
pharmaceutical and medical instrument areas were the major contributors to the 
corporation's total sales growth. Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert Co. 
said net income up was 23% to $112 million in the second quarter. Revenue 
climbed 8% to $1.02 billion. Each of its major businesses -- ethical 
pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter health-care products and confectioneries -- 
contributed to results, the company said.

MAKING THE DAY A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER;

<P>
BOLD, CALMING ART SPROUTS IN PUBLIC PLACES

Like mushrooms sprouting in a vast field, public art is blooming all over the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Art is being used to promote downtown revitalization, to calm anxious welfare 
recipients and to add a measure of brightness to a drab community center. Among 
recent developments: 
</P>
<P>
*The Public Art Partnership Panel of Escondido picked three, 20-foot-high, red, 
windmill-like sculptures last week for a key downtown site. 
</P>
<P>
*Within the next few weeks, Carlsbad will dedicate two public artworks. 
</P>
<P>
*Four specially colored local landscape murals were commissioned and hung at a 
county social services office in Chula Vista to provide a calming influence on 
anxious welfare clients. 
</P>
<P>
*"Wall of People," six wooden cutout figures in bright colors, was dedicated 
Wednesday at the Fallbrook Community Center, the latest of five projects 
financed by the county's Public Arts Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido public art panel's selection of "Three Windmills" as the winner 
for the $45,000 art project, at Quince Street and 2nd Avenue, was a major 
endorsement for sculpture with a distinct presence. 
</P>
<P>
The windmills were "a bolder statement" than either of two, more subtle 
environmental art proposals, said city planner Randy Mellinger, one of nine 
panelists. "The feeling was, at that location, a much bolder work was 
required." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego artist Marjorie Nodelman led a team including Katherine Stangle and 
Robert Niedringhaus who designed the windmills for the busy intersection, a 
major entry into downtown Escondido from Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
Nodelman described the artwork as "a kinetic image for cars -- almost like a 
visual Doppler effect." Now that the piece has been approved, Nodelman and 
company begin the final drawings and engineering studies required to fabricate 
the three windmills. 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido panel also picked San Diego County artists Mario Lara, Christine 
Oatman, Jesus Dominguez and the team of Joyce Cutler Shaw and Susan McLintock 
Whitin as semi-finalists for a $50,000 public art commission in Kit Carson 
Park. Each will develop a model for his or her proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Carlsbad will dedicate two new works in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles artist Lloyd Hamrol's environmental "Crown Lair" sculpture will be 
dedicated Aug. 4 at Stagecoach Park. The $75,000 piece, a series of low, 
curving sandstone walls, has been completed, and grass seed is sprouting in the 
surrounding earth. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Carlsbad, a 15-foot-diameter medallion depicting a bird of paradise 
plant, conceived by Jim Hubbell of Julian, will be dedicated in a few weeks. 
Built with mosaics, terrazzo and brass, the medallion, in the sidewalk at Elm 
Street and Carlsbad Boulevard, is 90% complete, according to Carlsbad 
redevelopment director Chris Salomone. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbell has been commissioned to provide a number of design elements for 
Carlsbad's 
</P>
<P>
$6.5-million center-city redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have gotten catalogue items, landscaped and beautified with bricks 
and bolt-down benches," Salomone said. "Our mission when we started this 
project was to capture what is uniquely Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
"One way to create uniqueness is to fabricate original materials. That's what 
artists do. We felt that using artists, and especially nationally known 
artists, gives us a bigger bonus." Hubbell has designed benches, light fixtures 
and a cement and iron arbor for downtown Carlsbad. New York environmental 
artist Andrea Blum has designed a $200,000 sculpture for the intersection of 
Carlsbad Boulevard, Ocean Street and Pine Street. Ground breaking for Blum's 
piece will be in October, with completion by summer of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In Fallbrook, artist Helen Redman's "Wall of People" made "a great improvement" 
for the community center, said center executive director Gordon Stone. "The 
inside of the building is a little on the drab side." 
</P>
<P>
Redman, who like Nemour, was funded by a $3,000 county Community Art Projects 
grant, spent time observing people at the center. She produced plywood cutouts 
of a girl on a gym bar, a man playing volleyball and an older woman exercising. 
</P>
<P>
However, not everyone likes the colorful images, Stone conceded. 
</P>
<P>
"Some said, 'Is that supposed to be me? I look so ugly.' " Stone said. 
"Actually, she combined a lot of people. She's really captured a good 
cross-section of typical community users. It's a great improvement." 
</P>
<P>
In Chula Vista, artist Leslie Nemour was given an unusual task: to design a 
series of indoor murals using only certain colors. Employees at the South Bay 
district office of county social services asked Nemour to use only pastels and 
cool tones, because of their soothing effect on people. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming to a welfare office is not always the most pleasant thing," said Lois 
Sibley, a worker at the office. "We wanted to make it a place that does not add 
to your stress." 
</P>
<P>
Sibley and other members of the office's quality circle, which was formed to 
improve the work environment, had researched the psychological effect of colors 
on people and applied for a Community Art Projects grant from the county's 
Public Arts Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Nemour painted four landscapes for the lobby: winter in the Southern California 
mountains, spring in the desert, summer in coastal Baja California and a beach 
near La Jolla in autumn. 
</P>
<P>
Nemour said she has spent time waiting in a social service office and wanted to 
be empathetic to others who "must endure this experience." 
</P>
<P>
"They're beautiful," said client Denise Miles, who was waiting in the lobby. 
"The mountains have so much color. The palm trees look so real. For a welfare 
department to have beautiful pictures is unusual. Maybe it adds a little peace 
to the place." 
</P>
<P>
The Fallbrook and Chula Vista projects were models in a new county-sponsored 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that these Community Art Projects will serve as models for the 
county in how other public artworks can be used, supported and encouraged," 
said Carol Hobson, former executive director of the Public Arts Advisory 
Council. "This was an opportunity to show (the county Board of Supervisors) 
programs that didn't quite fit the public art policy guidelines." Workers at 
the Chula Vista social services office also personally painted 36 small 
interview rooms using soothing colors or playful scenes with underwater and 
circus animals. Two interview rooms are painted in pink, which has a 
particularly soothing effect on hostile clients, said Joan Bond, a social 
services worker. 
</P>
<P>
The office's attention to art and color is paying off. Not only are clients 
soothed, but so are the workers. The South Bay district office has received an 
award for the lowest error rate of eight district offices. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bond: "It shows we can have beauty and be good workers too."

Radio station KPFK-FM, in an unusual gesture, broadcast an early wake Tuesday 
afternoon for its neighbor on the FM dial, KFAC, the pre-eminent classical 
music station that is expected to change formats in September. During the first 
hour of the two-hour program, some 20 listeners called in to lament news of 
KFAC's impending change. KPFK host William Malloch called his program " a sort 
of a funeral for KFAC." Said Malloch: "It appears KFAC will no longer broadcast 
classical music starting sometime in mid-September. . . . I think the situation 
is infuriating. I feel frustrated and I think listeners have rights. They're 
taking a classical music station away from us which we have gotten used to and 
which has become a part of our lives and we want it back." Malloch urged 
listeners who are upset about the station's expected demise to write and call 
the station and Evergreen Media Corp., which bought it in January for $55 
million, the highest price ever paid for a classical music station. Although 
station officials have not confirmed that the classical format will indeed 
change, station employees and industry insiders say they have been told that 
the station will change formats in September. The new format has not been 
chosen, according to KFAC's general manager Jim de Castro, but speculation 
centers on rock music. KFAC aired portions of a Rolling Stones press conference 
last week. Said Malloch: "One minute Bach, the next moment boom, Twisted 
Sister." ALEENE MacMINN

At a time of cuts in network program-standards staffs and increasing beefs by 
pressure groups about what they see as the rise of ribaldry on TV, Alice 
Henderson, a former CBS program-practices vice president, has set up her own 
New York-based consulting company to deal in matters of naughty and nice. For a 
fee, the company will advise TV show-makers on what may or may not be 
acceptable in what Henderson calls "this era of heightened concern in the 
private sector and in government regarding standards for sexuality, violence 
and language in television programs." ALEENE MacMINN

A payless payday looms this week for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, whose 
officials say they will be unable to pay regular biweekly salaries to 155 
employees because of worsening financial problems. Symphony Chairman Robert S. 
Miller says there is "no way" the orchestra will be able to come up with the 
$200,000 needed to give 97 musicians and 58 other staff members their full 
checks Thursday. The Detroit Federation of Musicians, which represents the 
symphony members, agreed to continue performing if the symphony could issue 
one-week paychecks. Miller said last month that the symphony would close in 
mid-July unless the state, city and businesses pledged $18.2 million for the 
next four years to help it overcome chronic financial problems. Since then, 
state, city and corporate leaders have given hopeful signs of additional 
funding but no hard commitments. The symphony has an $8-million debt that 
officials have said will reach $16 million by 1993. ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD; 
</P>
<P>
JOHNNY CASH STILL KNOWS HOW TO REACH JOE'S HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As far as much of middle America is concerned, Johnny Cash -- appearing tonight 
at Humphrey's on Shelter Island -- ranks right up there on the hero list with 
the late John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
For more than three decades, the legendary country singer with the crumbling 
rock of a baritone -- and a face to match -- has consistently managed to find 
his way into the heart of the average working-class Joe by singing about 
subjects Joe can either relate to or romanticize over. 
</P>
<P>
Among his best are "Folsom Prison Blues," "I Walk the Line," "I Got Stripes," 
"Understand Your Man," "Big River," "Ring of Fire" and "Orange Blossom 
Special," the latter a classic "train song" that is said to have inspired Arlo 
Guthrie's "City of New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many country artists, Cash started out singing rockabilly. In the 
middle 1950s, he was part of what has become known as the Million-Dollar 
Quartet, an impromptu group of Sun Records label mates including Elvis Presley, 
Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the others, however, Cash soon returned to his country roots and has 
since scored almost 130 hits on the Billboard country charts, more than any 
other artist except George Jones. He also veered on such album projects as 
1964's "Bitter Tears," which bemoans the mistreatment of the American Indian, 
and teamed with Bob Dylan at the height of Dylan's anti-Establishment 
posturings. 
</P>
<P>
And from Cash's official bio comes the revelation that the Man in Black has 
even "fished with Mick Jagger." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of whom . . . 
</P>
<P>
Just a suburb. Once again, San Diego gets snubbed. The Rolling Stones' 
just-announced reunion tour will take them to 31 cities throughout the United 
States and Canada. Between now and Sept. 27, the aging English supergroup will 
be appearing in virtually every major U. S. city, including New York City, Los 
Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Dallas, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, 
Atlanta and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent from the list is San Diego, despite the Stones having 
played to a sold-out crowd at Jack Murphy Stadium on their last tour in 1981. A 
call to the Rolling Stones' tour office in New York revealed there's still a 
lot of ignorance about our fair burg. A woman who gave her name only as Dawn 
said the reason the Stones decided to skip San Diego is really quite simple: 
"They're playing Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but Los Angeles and San Diego are two separate, 120- mile-apart cities. 
And big ones at that, respectively ranked second and seventh in terms of U. S. 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," said Dawn. 
</P>
<P>
None of this surprises Ted Edwards, program director for local album-rock radio 
station KGB-FM (101.5). "That gives us a rough idea of how San Diego is 
perceived by the industry," he said. "Who knows when we'll be rid of the stigma 
of being a suburb of Los Angeles?" 
</P>
<P>
Liner notes: Aside from the normal specifications regarding sound, lights, 
accommodations, and backstage food, the rider for Rod Stewart's July 28 concert 
at the San Diego Sports Arena calls for "a lone bagpiper" to roam through the 
crowd before the start of the show. Stewart is partial to Scottish culture. . . 
. Traditionally, heavy-metal acts enjoy the biggest concert "walk-up" -- 
tickets purchased at the door rather than in advance. But, of the 14 acts that 
have appeared so far in this year's Concerts by the Bay series at Humphrey's, 
the walk-up leader is the most un-metallic, Leo Kottke, who played there last 
Friday with fellow acoustic guitarist Michael Hedges. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Local rockabilly-blues trio the Paladins have arrived in England for the final 
eight dates in their three-week European tour. They'll be back in town next 
week for a July 28 homecoming performance at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana 
Beach. . . . Twelve years ago this week, San Diego singer-songwriter Stephen 
Bishop's biggest hit reached its highest chart position. "On and On" peaked on 
Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 11. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bob Dylan's upcoming Starlight Bowl concert has been moved back a day to Sept. 
6. . . . Tickets go on sale Friday at 3 p.m. for Joe Jackson's Aug. 26 
appearance at San Diego State University's Open Air Theater, and Saturday at 10 
a.m. for the Aug. 27 Jackson Browne concert, also at the Open Air Theater.

ACTRESS REBECCA SCHAEFFER FATALLY SHOT AT APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY and ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rebecca Schaeffer, an actress who co-starred in the television sitcom "My 
Sister Sam" and appeared in the recent movie "Scenes From the Class Struggle in 
Beverly Hills," was shot to death Tuesday morning by an unidentified man at her 
apartment house in the Fairfax District. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the man shot the 21-year-old Schaeffer in the chest, probably with 
a pistol, as she opened the glass security door at the front of the apartment 
complex in the 100 block of North Sweetzer Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The man probably had rung Schaeffer's doorbell to summon her, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can assume she may have known him, or maybe she was just a trusting 
person," Los Angeles Police Detective Dan Andrews said. ". . . Another 
possibility is (that) he might have stepped to the side . . . out of the view 
of the door. The third possibility is that she merely was going outside to 
leave or pick up a paper or whatever and was confronted by the suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer was rushed to nearby Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was 
pronounced dead on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said they knew of no motive for the fatal attack on the actress, who 
lived alone. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant, who reportedly had been loitering near the apartment house 
before the shooting, ran from the scene after the attack, and investigators 
said they had made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
A former boyfriend of the actress was questioned, police said, but he was not 
considered a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no record of her ever having called for assistance or being a victim 
of anything, or being harassed," Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't have an enemy in the world," her agent, Jonathan Howard, said 
Tuesday afternoon. "She was one of the nicest people I've ever known -- 
sincere, honest and kind. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very successful young actress, on the ascent, getting job after 
job," Howard said. "I can't believe this has happened." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Goldman, who lives across the street from the eight-unit apartment 
complex where Schaeffer resided, said he was in his kitchen about 10:15 a.m., 
making a pot of coffee, when he heard a gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
"After the shot, there were two screams. Two loud screams," Goldman said. "I 
put on a shirt and ran across the street. . . . There was a man with a yellow 
shirt, short, kinky hair, trotting up the block." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Newell, who lives in the building next door, said he, too, heard the 
shot and screams and ran to help, but by the time he arrived there was little 
he could do. 
</P>
<P>
"She was lying on the ground . . . wearing nothing but a little black 
bathrobe," Newell said. " . . . Her eyes were open, staring. It looked to me as 
though she was already dead." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said he did not notice whether the man who fled up Sweetzer Avenue and 
into an alley was carrying a gun. He said other residents of the area told him 
they had seen the man loitering by Schaeffer's apartment building earlier in 
the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunman was believed to be white, between 20 and 30 years old 
and between 5 feet, 7 inches and 6 feet tall. They said his hair was believed 
to be brown. In addition to the yellow shirt, they said, he was wearing blue 
denim pants and floppy sandals. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer, who grew up in Portland, Ore., was a 14-year-old student at Lincoln 
High School there when she went on a "cattle call" at a local modeling agency. 
Less than two years later, after appearing in a number of Portland-area 
publications, she went to New York to pursue her modeling career. 
</P>
<P>
"From my standpoint, it seemed very natural," she told an interviewer for a 
Portland newspaper a couple of years later. "But I know my parents went through 
hell." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, she appeared in Seventeen magazine, then went to Japan for more modeling 
assignments. But she told the interviewer that she was uncomfortable in Japan, 
so she returned to New York. There, a few months later, Schaeffer landed a 
small part in the television soap opera "One Life to Live," did a few 
commercials and finished up high school at New York's Professional Children's 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1986, after a series of auditions in New York and Los Angeles, she was 
selected for a lead role in the new CBS sitcom "My Sister Sam." 
</P>
<P>
"That was her big break," Howard said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer played a 16-year-old would-be rock star who invades the comfortable 
life of her elder sister, a 29-year-old San Francisco free-lance photographer, 
played by actress Pam Dawber. The show, which opened to mixed reviews in 
October, 1986, ran through that season and in parts of the next. The last 
episode aired in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Words cannot express the grief and rage that I feel," Dawber said in a 
statement from New York on Tuesday night. "My question is, why? My heart and 
sorrow go to her mother and father for losing such a beautiful child." 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer currently can be seen in the film "Scenes From the Class Struggle in 
Beverly Hills," a risque sex farce that is showing across the country after 
opening to generally good reviews in June. The actress played a supporting role 
as the daughter of a recently widowed sitcom queen, played by actress 
Jacqueline Bisset. 
</P>
<P>
According to Howard, Schaeffer recently completed work on a new film, "One 
Point of View," that stars and was directed by Dyan Cannon. In the film, which 
has yet to be released, Schaeffer plays the Cannon character in her teen-age 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said Schaeffer returned here a few weeks ago from Italy, where she had 
played a supporting role in an upcoming television miniseries about the tragedy 
aboard the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro.

The nation's stubborn trade deficit took an unexpected turn for the worse in 
May, ballooning to $10.24 billion, well above the 1989 low of $8.29 billion 
recorded in April, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Imports were the main reason for the deeper lurch into the red, as often has 
been the case in the past. U.S. business, still on an investment boom, 
continued to import nearly $20 billion in capital goods and industrial 
materials, which together counted for more than half of May's $1.7-billion 
increase in imported goods over April. Oil imports, boosted by higher prices 
and a 14% increase in volume, also soared by $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, exports of American-made and American-grown goods remained at 
near-record highs. 
</P>
<P>
Economists disagreed on whether the report points to an economy apparently 
facing a rapid slowdown. But there was consensus that the strong trade 
improvement of the last 18 months is now subsiding rapidly and that it likely 
will stall in the second half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"These numbers for May are definitely bad news," said Howard Lewis, 
international trade specialist at the National Assn. of Manufacturers. "We're 
still on track for an improvement in the trade deficit this year, but it will 
be smaller than last year and there's trouble ahead for 1990 and 1991," he said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York, agreed 
that the trade reversal in May probably was the start of a trend, after a 
period in which imports slowed and exports boomed. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be zigs and zags, month to month, but the improvement is now 
definitely flattening and the deficits may start getting worse," Kellner said. 
</P>
<P>
He added another warning: "The key point is that this is one more sign that the 
economy is in serious trouble. Since the growth in exports is declining, that 
could remove one of the last remaining props under economic activity. And the 
fact that imports are growing while consumer spending is declining clearly 
denotes a lack of competitiveness in many industries." 
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in the deficit was well above the financial markets' 
expectations of a modest increase to about $9 billion. While export levels 
remained high, May's total slipped $300 million below the $30.76 billion of 
products shipped overseas in April, the all-time high-water mark for 
merchandise exports. 
</P>
<P>
Kellner noted that the U.S. trade balance with virtually every part of the 
world worsened in May. The biggest imbalance, with Japan, grew from $3.89 
billion to $4.28 billion. The deficit with developing countries went from $3.63 
billion to $4.99 billion, while a small $231-million surplus with Western 
Europe tipped back into a $78-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But analyst Giulio Martini of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York was 
less pessimistic about the outlook for the economy. Noting that May's export 
total was within 1% of the April record high, and that the $800-million 
increase in imported capital goods outweighed the $100-million surge in 
consumer imports, he projected continued economic growth ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"The worry is on the import side," he said. Because industry is still investing 
heavily in foreign-made equipment and machinery, "you see a consistent increase 
in imports." Larger trade deficits may continue for the foreseeable future, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To some economists, the continuing flood of capital goods into the United 
States is begining to send an ominous signal. "To invest in machinery, to 
modernize is a good thing," said Lewis, "but a lot of this reflects the fact 
that we no longer make a lot of these products any more. It would be a hell of 
a lot better if more of these capital goods were coming from the domestic 
side." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he expects that continued slackening in the improvement in the trade 
deficit could trigger renewed pressure in Congress for punitive measures 
against nations that run a large trade surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit for 1989 should wind up $10 billion to $15 billion better 
than 1988's $118.53 billion, he said, but in the monthly tallies ahead, "we 
don't expect it to get better. We expect it to bottom out and get worse." 
</P>
<P>
". . . When a lot of people in this town who expect the trade deficit will keep 
on improving realize that it is hitting a wall around $110 billion, then we'll 
get a reignition of the debate on trade policy that could make 1987 look like a 
picnic," he said, referring to the big push for the trade reform measure that 
finally became law last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
The news literally fell out of the blue, landing on furniture company executive 
John Blackwelder and his wife as they watched television on a warm summer's 
evening in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
A Washington lawyer named Thomas Root had been miraculously plucked from the 
Atlantic Ocean, the newscast said, after a bizarre six-hour airplane flight in 
which he slumped unconscious in his Cessna 210 while the automatic pilot 
carried him toward what seemed certain death. 
</P>
<P>
For the Blackwelders, Root's name rang a bell. Indeed, a letter from him was 
lying on their armoire at that very moment -- a letter related to thousands of 
dollars they had invested in applications for federal licenses for new FM radio 
stations. Root was their lawyer in the deals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
About to Call 
</P>
<P>
"I was just about to call that guy again," Blackwelder told his wife. What was 
going on? 
</P>
<P>
Why had Root's strange flight taken place -- what was he doing, what caused him 
to lose consciousness, how did he survive the crash and how had he been wounded 
in the abdomen by a gunshot? No one, except perhaps Root himself, could say for 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
What was going on with the Blackwelders' investments in radio station 
applications, on the other hand, was in some ways a mystery only to the 
Blackwelders and other unwary investors in cities and towns scattered across 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a city of insiders, the business about the radio stations had 
been a subject of knowing glances for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
And the revelations that have followed Root's ill-fated flight appear to be a 
classic illustration of the perils that await ordinary investors when they 
venture into an esoteric field dominated by a relative handful of sophisticated 
insiders. It is also a story of deregulation run amok. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Piled in Stacks 
</P>
<P>
At the Federal Communications Commission, which controls radio station 
licensing in the nation, applications for FM radio licenses filed by Root 
together with a little-known Georgia company called Sonrise Management 
Services, Inc., were piled in stacks. So numerous were they that they formed a 
significant part of the 2,300-case backlog that developed during the FCC's 
eight-year rush toward deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
Sonrise was a company with problems. To insiders -- the communications lawyers, 
federal regulators and others in the field -- Sonrise's success at finding 
investors who would pour money into quests for licenses that almost never 
materialized was a subject of derision. 
</P>
<P>
Within the fraternity, Sonrise was known to be a company under investigation 
for possible securities-law violations and for running what one formal FCC 
legal opinion months ago termed a possible "scam on innocent investors." 
</P>
<P>
To thousands of investors like the Blackwelders, on the other hand, investors 
who have sunk more than $15 million into Sonrise-organized license application 
efforts, the firm's troubling record was a secret, veiled behind a web of 
evasions and a bureaucracy with little time to look out for the investors' 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
To the investors, Sonrise was a company that promised management with a 
"Christian ethic." For some, it simply offered an opportunity for profits. For 
others, Sonrise offered a special, more personal inducement: many of the 
licenses it was avowedly seeking were to be used for religious broadcasting; 
many who put money into Sonrise's projects saw them in part as an opportunity 
to advance their faith via the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
And -- but for Tom Root's strange adventure -- all the investors might still 
remain in the dark about the activities of Sonrise. 
</P>
<P>
When Root's plane plunged into the Atlantic last Thursday near the Bahamian 
island of Eleuthera, he had filed a flight plan for Rocky Mount, N.C., where he 
was to participate in a legal proceeding involving one of the more than 160 
Sonrise-related FM partnerships. As news of the crash spread, members of 
Washington's tight-knit fraternity of communications specialists began to 
wonder: Was this really an accident? 
</P>
<P>
The questions became public the next day, when police in Hollywood, Fla., where 
Root had been taken to the hospital, revealed that he had been shot. "It 
appears to a self-inflicted gunshot wound," police spokesman David Steele said. 
Root and his family have denied this adamantly ever since. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
If Suicide, Why? 
</P>
<P>
But the possibility raised another intriguing question: If it was a suicide 
attempt, why? 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with more than a score of communications lawyers, past colleagues of 
Root's and current clients, together with an examination of hundreds of pages 
of FCC documents have disclosed repeated difficulties in Root's law practice. 
</P>
<P>
But even more, the evidence has raised disturbing questions about Sonrise, 
Root's current chief source of business. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, Sonrise has been in the business of organizing groups 
of investors to apply for radio licenses. At least 163 such applications have 
been filed so far. Virtually all are now under scrutiny at the FCC. None of the 
applications have yet been fully approved and the handful that have received 
first-stage clearance by the FCC are now under renewed challenge. 
</P>
<P>
To date, although some investors have succeeded in getting refunds, none seems 
to have earned any return on investments that in some cases exceeded $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
A senior FCC official, Administrative Law Judge Walter C. Miller, has labeled 
the company an "application mill" and raised questions about whether its 
applications for licenses were "shams." North Carolina securities regulators 
have been investigating possible securities violations by the company in that 
state, where many of its investors reside. And a Tennessee law firm, 
representing a group of Georgia investors in Sonrise partnerships, accused the 
firm -- in a complaint to Georgia consumer protection officials -- of 
"apparently fraudulent and illegal actions" taken in inducing "unsophisticated 
investors" to place money in its projects. 
</P>
<P>
Sonrise officials declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this story. 
A company receptionist said Tuesday that the firm would not comment beyond a 
brief statement that it released Friday. In that statement, the company noted 
that it "has never been found guilty of any securities-related violation or 
wrongdoing, nor has any enforcement proceeding been instituted or charges 
brought." 
</P>
<P>
Root and his family members did not respond to a series of written questions 
sent by telefax to him at the Florida hospital where he is recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
Root began his work in communications law in the early 1980s. He was "a super, 
super intelligent person," recalled his employer at the time, Edward M. 
Johnson, a controversial Tennessee businessman and promoter. "Tom always knew 
how to get what he wanted," Johnson said. "If he couldn't get it through the 
front door, he'd get it through the back." 
</P>
<P>
At the time Root entered the communications field, the Reagan Administration's 
drive for deregulation -- along with changing technology -- was revolutionizing 
the field. And one of the Reagan Administration's policy changes transformed 
the landscape of radio licensing: 
</P>
<P>
FCC rules had long given preference in handing out broadcast licenses to people 
who live in the area to be served by a new station. But in 1981, the commission 
decided that if a partnership applied for a license, only the residence of the 
general partner would be considered. Limited partners -- people who put up 
money but take no active role in management -- could live anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1982, the Administration backed changes in communications law that 
allowed applicants to pay unlimited sums to buy out competitors seeking 
licenses. Such settlement payments quickly ballooned, often reaching into the 
mid-six-figures, sometimes higher. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of those two changes was dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a group of investors from any part of the country could find out 
about a broadcast opening, form a partnership, find a local resident to serve 
as the general partner -- preferably a woman or a member of a minority group or 
a person with some broadcast experience to take advantage of preferences in FCC 
policy -- and bid for a license. If they won, they would own a valuable 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they didn't win -- even if their chances of winning were small -- they 
often could count on other, more serious, applicants to pay large sums to get 
rid of them. 
</P>
<P>
And consultants, by putting together such partnerships and helping them through 
the process, could make large profits. 
</P>
<P>
That is Sonrise's business. In 1986, two men from Georgia, Ralph M. Savage and 
Eugene B. White, and one from North Carolina, Charles D. McFall, along with 
several partners incorporated Sonrise Management Services. 
</P>
<P>
McFall, like several other people who would work as salesmen for Sonrise over 
the next three years, had owned a distributorship with Amway, the home products 
company known for its aggressive marketing and for complaints that its 
structure amounted to a pyramid scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Sonrise, according to sworn statements by McFall and Savage in FCC proceedings, 
was organized similarly: regional sales representatives who provided 
distributorships to area representatives who in turn provided distributorships 
to local representatives. 
</P>
<P>
When Sonrise was formed, the hottest field at the FCC was the lottery for 
cellular telephone franchises. The firm organized 30 partnerships that applied 
in hundreds of markets. Several made considerable amounts of money. Then, in 
1987, when the cellular markets were exhausted, the company switched to 
marketing applications for FM radio stations and it engaged Root to represent 
its applicants before the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
The Sonrise system, as outlined in depositions and the company's own 
promotional material, was simple. Sonrise, acting through a pyramid of 
salespeople, would seek out investors. Most lived in the Carolinas, Georgia and 
northern Florida, although some are to be found spread across the nation from 
Virginia to California. In sales meetings and promotional videotapes, White and 
Savage would tout the potentially huge returns that investors could earn from 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Christian Claim 
</P>
<P>
And not only could a person earn money, sales representatives would explain, 
Sonrise was a Christian company. Why, even its name proclaimed its faith -- 
S-o-n-rise. Many of the partnerships the company would proceed to organize had 
a religious theme, as shown by the names they chose for themselves: Good News 
Limited Partnership, Emmanuel FM, Paradise Communications, Holy Spirit, Holy 
Hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never invested in radio before," said Dr. Robert L. Groat, a Greensboro, 
N.C., ophthalmologist who was one of Sonrise's largest investors, entrusting 
more than $100,000 to the firm's care. When questions would come up in sales 
meetings, "they had good answers," Groat said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, now, looking back there were discrepancies." 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, one of the puzzles was the price. According to several Washington 
attorneys active in the broadcast license field, a group of investors who 
wanted to own a radio station probably, on average, could get an application 
filed, the necessary engineering work done and lawyers paid for about $15,000 
to $20,000. Sonrise, by contrast, collected roughly $90,000 from each of its 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
According to a sworn deposition by Savage, the company's former chairman who 
now serves as a Sonrise consultant, that money would be divvied up: Sonrise 
itself would keep $19,700, plus another $27,000 that would go in commissions to 
its sales staff; $10,300 would go to pay engineers and FCC filing fees; the 
remaining $32,000 would be held for Root. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Sonrise would retain virtually all the money in its hands. According 
to a billing statement inadvertently submitted by Root to the FCC in a Sonrise 
case, the money provided for Root would be kept by Sonrise and parcelled out to 
him in $1,500 increments as he billed the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Root, through his brother Todd, told the Washington Post Sunday that he has 
been paid roughly $1.6 million by Sonrise so far. A source close to Root told 
The Times that Root recently had said that the company owed him another $2 
million in unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
A second question involves the structure of the partnerships. Investors 
interviewed by The Times repeatedly said that their role, as they understood it 
from the beginning, was to be passive "limited partners." Only the local 
"general partner" that Sonrise would locate for each application would have a 
management role in the station, they were told. 
</P>
<P>
That structure would accord with the FCC's preference for local control of 
stations. But the sale of limited partnerships is, under the laws of most 
states, usually considered the sale of a security, and security sales are 
heavily regulated, requiring extensive disclosure of risks and costs. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that avoided subjecting itself to those rules, Sonrise would market 
its packages as general partnerships. Then, later on, it would legally convert 
them to a limited-partner structure. The question of whether that pattern 
complies with the law is at the center of the securities investigation in North 
Carolina, officials say, and has been questioned by authorities in other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
A third problem involved the general partners. The main benefit of working 
through Sonrise, investors were told, was the firm's expertise at locating 
appropriate individuals in each community where a new station would be located. 
And in fact, many of the general partners located by Sonrise were highly 
qualified. 
</P>
<P>
In several cases, however, they were not. In at least two cases, the general 
partner located by Sonrise later turned out to have a criminal record, dooming 
the license application. And in virtually all cases, the Sonrise general 
partners lacked a key criterion: money. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC requires license applicants to certify that they have on hand or 
committed to them sufficient funds to build a station and operate it for three 
months before ad revenues begin flowing in. But the Sonrise general partners 
almost invariably had no funds at hand except the $90,000 that the partnership 
had raised. And those funds, Sonrise already had taken. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Sonrise partnerships have faced a recurring question: Who's really 
in charge? FCC rules require that broadcast license applicants actually be the 
people who are going to run a station if it is licensed. But in Sonrise's case, 
the firm's key role in making decisions -- from locating the partners to hiring 
their lawyer to holding their money and preparing their tax returns -- have 
suggested to FCC officials that Sonrise, not the partnerships, was really in 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly, that question has been raised about Sonrise applications and, 
routinely, the applications have been withdrawn, preventing the questioning of 
Sonrise officials in a hearing. Partners who inquired about why their 
applications had been dropped would be offered "feeble excuses," said Groat. 
</P>
<P>
The result, in case after case has been that Sonrise-related applications have 
been dismissed as they have come to hearings. In some cases, investors have 
been promised compensation after they inquired -- usually new shares in another 
partnership. In most cases, however, investors interviewed by The Times said 
that they had been given virtually no information about the status of their 
investments or the legal difficulties that their partnerships were 
encountering. 
</P>
<P>
And in all that, some of them have begun to wonder, where were the watchdogs? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, communications lawyers say, is that the theoretical watchdogs -- 
the FCC staff -- has been so short-handed and overwhelmed by a flood of 
applications that in recent years it has ceased almost entirely to monitor the 
bona fides of new applicants. Checking has involved little more than making 
sure applicants had complied with proper engineering standards and had filled 
out their forms correctly. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, said attorney J. Richard Carr, a longtime communications-law 
expert, effectively left the job of policing the process to the private bar, 
assuming that rival applicants would hunt out frauds. But often, he explained, 
private attorneys and their clients have found it cheaper to buy out 
questionable rivals rather than raise questions about them publicly. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan-era rules changes, a special committee of the Federal Communications 
Bar Assn. wrote in a recent review of the situation, have "greatly increased 
the incidence of speculative and sham applications." 
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesman Tuesday defended the agency's record, noting that the 
commission staff has now begun investigating both Sonrise and the whole subject 
of sham applications. 
</P>
<P>
"We're following the normal procedures," Patricia Chew said. "The wheels here 
turn very slowly."

The South Lake Tahoe City Council has voted to replace former council member 
and mayor Terry Trupp by appointment, rather than by a special election. Trupp, 
who resigned July 31 after his arrest on cocaine trafficking and money 
laundering charges, is being held without bail in Sacramento County Jail. City 
Council members agreed to accept applications from people interested in the 
position until 5 p.m. July 28. All applicants will be interviewed and the 
original list will be trimmed to a group of finalists, from which the successor 
will be appointed. Trupp's council term runs through June of next year. His 
tenure as mayor automatically expired at the end of last month. Trupp, 46, was 
among about 20 people arrested after a 20-month investigation by federal, state 
and local agents called "Operation Deep Snow."

President Bush, in a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, has 
echoed the statement of Secretary of State James A. Baker III that the idea of 
a "greater Israel" should be abandoned, National Public Radio said in a 
broadcast from Washington. Baker's exhortation, in a speech on May 22, was 
attacked by friends of Israel in Congress. The network said Bush endorsed 
Baker's call on Israel to give up any idea of annexing the West Bank of the 
Jordan River, occupied by Israeli troops since 1967, to stop new settlements in 
that territory and to reopen Palestinian schools.

Western European countries and Canada have pledged $1.8 billion in aid over the 
next three years to war-ravaged Central America, provided that the region makes 
progress toward peace and democratic reforms, U.N. officials said. The money is 
to be administered by the U.N. Development Program, which has drawn up a 
program for the region that would cost a total of $4.3 billion. The program, 
known as the Special Plan for Economic Cooperation for Central America, ranges 
from measures to help Central American refugees to steps that would reactivate 
the defunct Central American Common Market, reduce the region's foreign debt 
and promote industry and agriculture.

The Senate brushed aside complaints that President Bush is packing the ranks of 
the nation's envoys with unqualified political cronies and defeated a bid to 
restrict political appointments to 15% of the diplomatic corps. The vote 
rejecting an amendment by Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) was 79 to 20. Gore 
said he would try again today and offered an amendment to hold to 30% the 
number of ambassadors and senior State Department officials nominated for their 
political contributions. But Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and others contended 
that the proposed restriction would represent an intrusion on the President's 
ability to conduct foreign policy.

William Lucas, nominated to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, 
gave inaccurate answers on a sworn application to the New York bar, the Justice 
Department acknowledged. Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade confirmed 
that the Michigan Republican failed to state on the New York form in 1981 that 
he had once failed the District of Columbia bar exam. His application to New 
York was successful. Lucas, 61, simply stated that he was admitted to the 
Michigan bar in 1971 when asked if he had ever taken another state bar 
examination or applied to practice in another state. Lucas also answered in the 
negative when he was asked if he had ever been a witness in a civil or criminal 
court proceeding, when he had testified numerous times, Burstion-Wade 
confirmed. The admission came to light as Lucas' two home state senators, 
Democrats Carl Levin and Donald W. Riegle Jr., said they would break with usual 
Senate practice and would not introduce him to the Senate Judiciary Committee 
at the opening of confirmation hearings today.

The Senate, under pressure from the Bush Administration, has agreed to postpone 
consideration of a bill that would place new restrictions on Washington's 
dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, the New York Times 
reported. Israeli officials are putting increased pressure on the 
Administration and Congress to stop the meetings, which began after PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat stated late last year that the group had renounced 
terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist. The legislation, sponsored by 
Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), would bar U.S.-PLO 
talks unless President Bush certified that participants had no connection to 
acts of terror. The measure is reported to also have bipartisan support in the 
House.

LUJAN, WATKINS ASSAIL PUSH FOR 1-YEAR BAN ON OFFSHORE DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, Times Sacramento Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Cabinet members argued the Bush Administration's case for offshore oil 
drilling before a meeting of 16 Western governors Tuesday, contending that it 
is the only way America can become energy self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and Energy Secretary James D. Watkins both 
criticized the strong push in Congress for a one-year moratorium on offshore 
drilling along most of the U.S. coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Each secretary pointed out that it was not offshore oil rigs but tankers that 
caused the recent rash of oil spills, generating a wave of anti-drilling 
sentiment in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan, much of whose speech to the governors was reported in Tuesday's Times, 
advocated forcing shipping companies to build "super ports" roughly five miles 
offshore to unload their oil cargoes. The oil would then be transported to land 
through pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
"While tankers continue to spill oil into our waters and offshore drilling 
continues to provide a record of environmentally sound production, why are we 
attacking offshore drilling and letting the tankers nestle into our harbors?" 
he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan also said radar should be used to direct port traffic, much as control 
towers direct airplanes around airports. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to leave the impression with all of you that we're saying we're 
going to drill come hell or high water," Lujan told the Western governors, 
gathered in Long Beach for their annual conference. "We're saying we would like 
to drill in areas where we can do it in an environmentally sound manner." 
</P>
<P>
There will be no drilling at all until at least October, 1990, if the Senate 
follows the House's lead and votes to put 84 million acres of the nation's 
outer continental shelf -- including the entire California coast -- temporarily 
off limits to oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Our experience has been that when you declare a moratorium in a temporary way 
it becomes permanent very quickly," Watkins lamented. "I am very worried." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins reported that the United States is now importing nearly 50% of its oil. 
"That's a very serious situation. We don't know what it bodes for the future," 
he said, warning of another potential Arab oil boycott. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be a great concern one day when we turn around again and find 
ourselves asking, 'Where have we gone wrong?' " 
</P>
<P>
A native Californian, Watkins said he realizes how "very sensitive" offshore 
drilling is in this state. Reminiscing about growing up here, the 62-year-old 
Cabinet secretary recalled, "I used to ride my bicycle down from Pasadena to 
Long Beach and swim in the surf. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It was beautiful. We walked on the beach and got oil on our feet and we 
thought that was good because it was helpful to the economy of the state of 
California." 
</P>
<P>
The governors, winding up their two-day meeting, had little reaction to the 
Cabinet secretaries' pitch for offshore oil operations. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, a Democrat and former transportation secretary in 
the Jimmy Carter Administration, complained that his state was not included 
with California in an offshore leasing moratorium during the heat of last 
year's presidential campaign. He asserted that the Bush Administration does not 
seem to be interested in smaller Oregon's environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worthy of Study' 
</P>
<P>
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian reiterated his opposition to an offshore oil 
moratorium, noting that production of natural gas is also at stake. "We've had 
several one-year moratoriums. What (critics) really want," he continued "is a 
total ban. Let's not forget that." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, chairman of the conference he is hosting in his hometown, said 
Lujan's proposal for offshore ports is "worthy of study." 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, a Democrat, denounced the cleanup efforts of the 
federal government and Exxon Corp. after the disastrous Valdez oil spill. He 
branded the nation's oil cleanup strategy as "woefully insufficient" and 
offered several suggestions, including placing the Coast Guard in charge, 
requiring the spillers to pay the entire bill and developing a small fleet of 
ships that can skim leaked oil off the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Sulnick, executive director of the American Oceans Campaign, an 
environmental group based in California and in Washington, called Lujan's 
offshore drilling position misguided. 
</P>
<P>
"What the country needs is an alternative energy program based on conservation 
or renewable fuels," he said. "What the country does not need is an oil policy 
that uses American oil first, Middle East oil last and creates a certainity of 
oil spills like we witnessed in Alaska, Rhode Island and Texas in the last 
several months." 
</P>
<P>
The governors wound up their conference by adopting a thick packet of 
resolutions. One by Cowper embodied most of his recommendations for developing 
an oil cleanup strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Another Cowper resolution urged the Bush Administration to return the Soviet 
Union to "most favored nation" status if Moscow continues to relax restrictions 
on Jewish emigration. 
</P>
<P>
The governors also adopted a Deukmejian resolution urging the Western states to 
consolidate some of their costly, duplicative foreign trade efforts and team up 
on new ones.

COMPROMISE INMATE WORK PROGRAM WINS PANEL'S OK

Gov. George Deukmejian's long-stalled effort to amend the state Constitution 
and allow prison convicts to work in private enterprise to help pay their room 
and board cleared a steep legislative barrier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Over the opposition of organized labor, the heavily rewritten proposal narrowly 
cleared the Assembly Public Safety Committee with the key vote of liberal 
Democratic Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, organized labor has almost effortlessly crushed similar attempts 
to employ prison inmates at private jobs. Likewise, the Democratic-dominated 
Public Safety Committee long has constituted a stiff roadblock for prison 
"reform" efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Major features of the compromise negotiated over the past month by Friedman and 
representatives of Deukmejian would prohibit the use of prisoners as 
strikebreakers and the employment of inmates to displace California workers. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, one of the Legislature's most liberal Democrats, joined Assemblyman 
William P. Baker of Danville, one of its most conservative Republicans, in 
pushing the Deukmejian plan through the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a creative and intelligent step in the right direction," Friedman said 
of the compromise. A spokesman for Deukmejian said the governor "strongly 
supports the measure in its current form." 
</P>
<P>
In his State of the State speech in January, Deukmejian proposed repealing the 
constitutional prohibition against using state prisoners to perform labor for 
private businesses. Faced with a dramatic increase in the prison population and 
a tight budget, he said prisoners should help pay for their keep, make 
restitution to their victims and participate in mandatory savings plans. 
</P>
<P>
Organized labor denounced the proposal as another attempt to create a "captive 
labor force" that would displace working men and women and leave prisoners 
exposed to employer exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Deukmejian called for employing 7,000 prison inmates in private 
industry tasks, ranging from assembling high-tech parts and equipment to making 
clothing and sorting garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise calls for a maximum of 2,000 volunteer prisoners to participate 
in private employment, which would be conducted only on the grounds of state 
prisons. The Legislature could allow more prisoners to work if the program 
operated successfully. 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners would be paid wages comparable to those paid locally for similar 
work, or at least at the level of the federal minimum wage. Upon parole, 
inmates who successfully participated in the program would receive job 
placement and counseling services. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran California labor leader John F. Henning, executive secretary-treasurer 
of the state AFL-CIO, who has battled similar proposals for years, criticized 
the amendments as "plastic." 
</P>
<P>
"You're still dealing with private business exploiting prisoners for their own 
profit," said Henning, whose testimony fell far short in its intensity of only 
a few months ago when he angrily denounced it as a "turning back of the clock 
of history." 
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 state inmates now work in prison industry programs that produce 
goods ranging from license plates to office furniture. The office furniture is 
sold only to government entities and does not compete with privately 
manufactured goods on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman joined three Republicans and conservative Democratic Assemblyman Gary 
A. Condit of Ceres to send the proposal to the Ways and Means Committee. Two 
Democrats voted no and another abstained. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the full Legislature, the proposal would appear on the 1990 
ballot. It would establish for adult prisoners a private work program patterned 
after a 1984 program created for California Youth Authority inmates, who 
technically are exempt from the constitutional ban on inmate labor. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, the committee killed an "anti-gang" bill by Sen. Ed Davis 
(R-Valencia) that would have allowed police to randomly stop and search 
vehicles for guns when a city council or board of supervisors declared a local 
state of "extreme peril" because of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Davis noted gang-related "murder rampages" during recent weekends in Los 
Angeles and said his bill would allow law enforcement authorities to make a 
"reasonable search under the circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
The bill received only three favorable votes of the five needed for approval.

STATE ON FRONT LINE IN BATTLE OVER TEACHING OF EVOLUTION 
</P>

<P>
Christian fundamentalists and civil libertarians are bracing for an all-out 
confrontation over the teaching of evolution in the schools as the California 
Curriculum Commission prepares to recommend guidelines for science textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
The spark for the latest renewal of the century-old dispute over the origin of 
man is a proposed framework for science textbooks that suggests that the 
evolutionary theory is "accepted fact." The framework has been drafted by the 
commission's science subject matter committee and is still subject to final 
commission approval before being forwarded as a recommendation to the 11-member 
state Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all hell's going to break lose if the board buys it," said Robert 
Simonds, president of the National Assn. of Christian Educators and Citizens 
for Excellence in Education. "It will mean kids are going to go out of those 
science classes totally brainwashed." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Michael Hudson, western director for People for the American 
Way, sees the proposed guidelines as "the most affirmative and straightforward 
statement about evolution that I have ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
The issue for each side is whether evolution will be taught exclusively in 
California science textbooks or whether the sudden-appearance, or creationist, 
theory espoused by fundamentalist religious groups will also be treated. 
California, as one of the largest purchasers of textbooks, often sets the tone 
for the nation in its adoption of texts. 
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to a public hearing on the proposed framework later this week, the 
two sides are planning back-to-back press conferences. Hudson said People for 
the American Way may resort to television advertising if the creationists 
appear to be making inroads with the state Board of Education as it nears a 
decision in the fall. Simonds, meanwhile, said his groups have started the 
research preparatory to a challenge of the guidelines in the California courts. 
</P>
<P>
People for the American Way, which once concentrated most of its efforts in 
Texas, has beefed up its California operation for what it views as a crucial 
battle on the content of science textbooks. The group was organized in 1980 by 
writer-producer-director Norman Lear and others to challenge ultraconservative 
influence on public policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest hurdle is people thinking surely we don't still have to battle 
this issue," Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
The focus for each side in the renewed struggle is the Board of Education, 
which established a new science teaching policy last winter that was considered 
a victory for the evolutionists. The policy, pushed by Supt. of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig, required that only scientific fact, hypothesis and 
theory should be presented in the textbooks, and religious beliefs "not subject 
to scientific test and refutation" should be discussed in a social science 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Since the unanimous decision to adopt the policy, however, four Board of 
Education members have retired, and others have made statements indicating that 
evolution should not be too strongly emphasized. After informally reviewing a 
draft of the framework, Chairman Francis Laufenberg said the board advised the 
commission that to refer to evolution as fact would be "inconsistent" with the 
new policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education also asked for modifications of a discussion in the 
guidelines of evolution versus creationism because "it is an advocacy statement 
of evolution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Takes Comments Seriously 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Stage, chairman of the science committee, said that while the 
commission takes the board's comments "quite seriously," it may or may not 
follow them in its final recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Religious groups, after re-examining the policy statement, now believe that it 
leaves room for the teaching of creationism. For textbooks to present evolution 
as the only theory of the origin of man, they say, would violate the policy's 
requirement that "nothing shall be taught dogmatically." 
</P>
<P>
"Now the issue is to what extent shall the board offer a balanced viewpoint," 
said the Rev. Louis Sheldon, chairman of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values 
Coalition. "Students should have access in the classroom to the scientific 
evidence . . . revealing the problems, weaknesses and failures of the theories 
of the origin of man. That includes all of them -- creationism and evolution." 
</P>
<P>
He argued that the proposed framework by asserting evolution as "accepted fact" 
mandates a dogmatic presentation of the evolutionary theory in direct violation 
of the board's policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see the science classroom used as a platform to 
evangelistically crusade for Christianity; neither do we want it to be used to 
tear down a child's faith by talking about evolution as fact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Countered Hudson: "To claim that teaching evolution and science is dogmatic is 
like claiming that to teach the Earth is round or two plus two equal four is 
dogmatic." 
</P>
<P>
Stage said that while there are competing scientific theories within evolution 
which must be presented to students, "there's no dispute about the overall 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Lange, a spokesman for Honig, said the schools chief was surprised by the 
new interpretation of the policy and is preparing to challenge it before the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honig Promoted Policy 
</P>
<P>
The new policy was promoted by Honig as part of an effort to improve the 
teaching of science in California. Scientists argued that the previous policy 
was so vague that textbook publishers and science teachers often simply avoided 
controversial subjects such as evolution. 
</P>
<P>
In California, new textbooks are adopted every seven years through a laborious 
process that begins with the establishment of the policy and follows with the 
adoption of a detailed framework. Using the framework as a guide, textbooks are 
next written and submitted for approval. The board then draws up a list of 
accepted books, from which local school districts make their selections.

BENNETT GIVES PREVIEW OF DRUG STRATEGY, SAYS INNER CITIES WILL BE TARGET AREAS 
</P>

William J. Bennett, director of the Administration's war on drugs, Tuesday 
described what he said are the highlights of his national anti-drug strategy, 
saying it will focus on blighted urban areas and attempt to recapture them from 
"the bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
The projected focus would mark a departure from previous federal efforts, which 
were aimed primarily at seizing narcotics being smuggled into the country and 
combatting drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bennett made it clear that he still regards such efforts as essential, 
he suggested that they will remain largely irrelevant so long as "anarchy and 
chaos" reign in the inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
"The top priority for this strategy will be to focus on those places in America 
where the good guys are not in charge," Bennett declared in a speech to a 
convention of local prosecutors here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cross-Country Trip 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's disclosure was made as he started on a cross-country trip designed to 
rally public sentiment behind the comprehensive effort, which is expected to be 
a subject of intense debate when it is announced in September. 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not describe in detail the kinds of anti-drug programs that 
would be given prominence in the plan's urban focus, he hinted strongly that 
they would involve significant new spending in the form of federal assistance 
to beleaguered state and community law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Such a program almost certainly would call for the deployment on a national 
scale of the kinds of emergency assistance that the Bush Administration granted 
earlier this year to Washington, D.C., in attempting to overcome an 
unprecedented rash of drug-related crime. The U.S. marshals and other federal 
agents dispatched to the district as part of the package have since staged 
impressive raids on the city's most drug-plagued areas. 
</P>
<P>
"You make life difficult for the bad guys," Bennett said of the goals of his 
strategy. "You make life difficult for the people who are making life difficult 
for the community." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Bennett also indicated that he has advocated a new approach 
against drug trafficking in Latin America. While he again declined to provide 
details, a senior Administration official said later that Bennett had urged 
that additional military resources be devoted to the effort and asked the 
National Security Council to grant up to $300 million in military aid to 
anti-drug campaigns in Peru, Bolivia and other cocaine-producing countries. 
</P>
<P>
The planned emphasis on stepped-up policing of American streets and Latin 
American jungles would attempt to put into practice Bennett's view that the 
drug war can be won only when traffickers and users are confronted directly by 
authorities and made to face severe consequences for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
In amplifying on that theme Tuesday, Bennett made it clear that a principal 
priority of his strategy would be to ensure "that the person who's dealing 
drugs or selling drugs has a more palpable fear of punishment than he has now." 
</P>
<P>
The familiar yardsticks federal authorities use to measure progress in the 
anti-drug effort, Bennett suggested, have provided little indication of whether 
use of illegal drugs is really being deterred. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing to capture kingpins," Bennett said. "It's a good thing to 
recover assets. It's a good thing to break criminal organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you do all these things, if people are still living in anarchy and 
chaos in the inner city, if drug use is still as high as it used to be, if 
innocent people still feel the threat, what's the point of doing all these 
things?. You haven't gotten to the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett told his audience here that his Office of National Drug Control Policy 
is "very near to closure" in drafting the anti-drug strategy that has been its 
principal focus since it was established four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The plan must still win the approval of the NSC and the White House Domestic 
Policy Council before it can be unveiled by President Bush, as scheduled, on 
Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposals most likely to engender opposition within the 
Administration is a stepped-up military role in the anti-drug effort in Latin 
America. Both the Pentagon and the State Department are said to have raised 
objections, and Bennett said Tuesday that consensus has been far "trickier" to 
secure on that issue than on domestic aspects of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
With most of his work on the draft completed, Bennett -- who has declined 
invitations to testify before Congress about the strategy -- Tuesday began a 
calculated effort to "get the American people behind us." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing some things unabashedly to get public support," Bennett confessed as 
he began a three-day, campaign-style swing from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm even going on the Oprah Winfrey show," he said.

The Pilgrim nuclear power plant was shut down manually Tuesday because the 
facility suffered an unexplained loss of vacuum in its main condenser, 
officials said. The condenser is on the steam side of the plant and did not 
cause any radiation leak, a spokesman said.

CHINA REARRESTS DISSIDENT, DETAINS BEIJING JOURNALIST

A former Chinese political prisoner who once studied at the University of 
Arizona was rearrested Tuesday for allegedly participating in pro-democracy 
protests in Shanghai this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Yang Wei, 34, who was released in January after two years in prison for 
participating in student demonstrations, was detained Tuesday in Shanghai on 
charges of conducting "demagogic propaganda for counterrevolutionary ends," the 
official New China News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Also disclosed Tuesday was the detention in Beijing of Dai Qing, a prominent 
journalist for the official Guangming Daily. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the Beijing office of Japan Air Lines received a 
letter from a previously unknown group threatening to kill two Japanese 
citizens a month in China. The letter charged that "Japanese pirates collude 
with the Communist Party dictatorial government and plot to launch a 
large-scale economic invasion of China." 
</P>
<P>
Japan has taken a relatively mild stance toward China since the June 3-4 
massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, arguing that it would not 
serve the interests of the West to isolate China. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the Japanese Embassy here, Hideo Watanabe, said the embassy had 
not determined how serious the threat might be. 
</P>
<P>
Dai, the Guangming Daily reporter, was among 12 prominent intellectuals who on 
May 14, the day before Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived in Beijing 
for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years, called for a compromise between 
pro-democracy student demonstrators in Tian An Men Square and the government. 
</P>
<P>
The Dai group's statement, published in the Guangming Daily on May 15 during a 
brief period of virtual press freedom, proposed that the students "temporarily" 
leave the square and that the government agree to three demands: no reprisals, 
recognition of the legality of student associations and no violence against 
hunger strikers in the square. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Guangming Daily, the statement went on to say: "These 12 
scholars stated in their appeal that if the government could not satisfy the 
above-mentioned demands, they would fight together with the students firmly." 
</P>
<P>
Police went to Dai's home Tuesday during dinner and led her away, saying they 
wanted to talk to her, according to Dai's husband, who was contacted by 
telephone by the Associated Press. He said he had not heard from her since she 
was taken away. There has been no official report of Dai's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The New China News Agency, in its report on Yang's arrest, said he had been 
working as a translator in a factory after his release from prison but that he 
"didn't show any penitence" and "continued to provide information" for the New 
York-based Chinese Alliance for Democracy. The alliance, formed by dissident 
Chinese students in the United States, has been officially labeled a 
"reactionary organization" in which it is illegal for Chinese citizens to be 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
During the spring pro-democracy demonstrations, Yang allegedly went to Shanghai 
university campuses and "mixed in the student parties or hunger strikes, 
collecting information for the organization and instigating students to oppose 
the Chinese government," the official news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Yang was at the University of Arizona from 1983 to 1986, earning a master's 
degree in molecular biology. In late 1987, after Yang had been in detention for 
many months but before his trial, Congress adopted a resolution declaring that 
he had broken no Chinese or U.S. laws and calling for his release.

EUROPEAN COMMUNITY KEEPS AUSTRIA WAITING 
</P>

<P>
West European diplomats suggested Tuesday that Austria's request for membership 
in the European Community faces a long wait. At the least, they said, Austria 
and other would-be members such as Turkey will have to stand in line until 
1992, when the single European market goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, sentiment is growing in some of the 12 member nations that the 
community should not be enlarged until the results of the single market can be 
experienced. Further, officials in some member nations are suggesting that 
candidates for admission be carefully screened on wealth, religion and feelings 
about neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, although Austria would appear to be a natural candidate -- it is situated 
in the center of Europe and was once a font of continental culture -- its 
application is being placed on hold until after Austria's neutral status is 
closely examined. 
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, in submitting his government's 
application to community officials Monday, said Austria's "internationally 
recognized status of permanent neutrality" must be maintained. Neutrality was 
written into the 1955 peace treaty that Austria signed with the United States, 
the Soviet Union, Britain and France, the victors of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
But some members of the European Community believe that it should be moving 
toward greater political unity and common security measures, and they have 
suggested that a neutral nation would not fit in. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland is generally neutral, but such status is not a part of its 
constitution. Nor did Ireland make it an issue when it entered the community in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, observers have predicted that many additional countries would 
eventually join the European Community, among them neutrals like Switzerland, 
the Nordic nations and Mediterranean nations such as Cyprus and Malta. But 
community officials in Brussels now suggest that the introduction of additional 
southern countries may be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Most northern nations are net contributors to the community, while Greece, 
Spain, Portugal and southern Italy are net recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has fought long and hard to get the size of its budget contribution 
reduced, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is thought to frown on welcoming 
countries that would make immediate demands on the community budget. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which applied for membership two years ago, has been the subject of 
debate. It is situated for the most part in Asia, and its people are largely 
Muslim. Its culture is vastly different from that of the community's mainly 
Christian European members. 
</P>
<P>
"We will all be studying the applications carefully," a Bonn diplomat said.

POLAND EXPECTED TO ELECT JARUZELSKI; 
</P>
<P>
HE DECIDES TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT; ASSEMBLY VOTES TODAY

<P>
Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski said Tuesday that he will be a 
candidate for the newly created office of president, virtually assuring his 
election today by the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Jaruzelski, 66, a career military officer, thus reversed his announcement 
of June 30 that he was withdrawing from the running. He cited "new facts" and 
"a sense of duty" as impelling him to stand for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Among the factors that caused his change of mind, Jaruzelski said, was "the 
need for the preservation of continuity of the functioning of the state and 
concern expressed for its stability." 
</P>
<P>
"International aspects were strongly emphasized," he went on. "It was commonly 
stressed that avoidance of responsibility in such a special moment would be in 
contradiction to the duties of a politician and a soldier." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'New Facts' 
</P>
<P>
Among the "new facts" was a slow collapse of resistance to Jaruzelski's 
candidacy among Communist Party allies in the National Assembly. In recent 
days, the Peasants' Party and the Central Committee of the Democratic Party 
came out in support of the general after nearly two weeks of waffling. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists and their allies have 300 of the 559 votes in the two-house 
National Assembly and should be able to elect Jaruzelski without help from the 
259 members of Solidarity, the independent trade union movement. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists won Solidarity's agreement to have an open roll-call vote on the 
presidency in order to ensure party discipline. It was not certain whether 
Solidarity will instruct some its members to vote for Jaruzelski if the vote is 
close, but last week, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa -- in a surprise public 
statement -- said he was willing to work with Jaruzelski if he were elected. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the habit of parliamentary democracy that an opposition votes in the 
same way as the government majority," Solidarity Sen. Karol Modzelewski said. 
However, Solidarity members could help Jaruzelski simply by not taking part in 
the voting, thereby reducing the needed majority. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, when he announced his withdrawal, endorsed his interior minister, 
Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, for the post, and he suggested again Tuesday that the 
National Assembly turn to Kiszczak if his own candidacy should fail. 
</P>
<P>
Kiszczak, however, has generated little enthusiasm in the Communist Party 
ranks, although Solidarity initially preferred him and Walesa actually endorsed 
him. Kiszczak had led the government side in the so-called round-table 
negotiations that led to Solidarity's return to the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
After Jaruzelski's withdrawal, it became evident that the Communist Party saw 
Jaruzelski as a stabilizing force and as far more trustworthy than Kiszczak, 
whose genial demeanor with Walesa and the Solidarity leadership suggested 
weakness to a party faced with an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, Jaruzelski met in closed sessions with each party 
organization, concluding Monday with a six-hour session with the Solidarity 
members of the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cool Response 
</P>
<P>
The Solidarity members, by and large, responded coolly to Jaruzelski, noting 
that he had failed to repudiate his 1981 declaration of martial law or Poland's 
participation in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that put down the "Prague 
Spring" reform movement in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski and his supporters in the party believe that the declaration of 
martial law, at the height of the Solidarity crisis, saved Poland from Soviet 
military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Under the recently rewritten Polish constitution, the president may serve two 
six-year terms and will control Poland's military and foreign relations -- thus 
assuring, in the current situation, Poland's continued close relations with the 
Soviet Union. Presumably, this is what Jaruzelski meant by his reference to the 
"international aspects" guiding his decision. 
</P>
<P>
The president's first order of business will be to appoint a prime minister, 
who will put together a government. The task is assuming growing urgency as the 
nation's economic situation appears to be worsening steadily. The annual 
inflation rate is now estimated at 160%, and shortages are chronic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat of Unrest 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, bus and tram drivers in Katowice, a heavily populated industrial 
area in south-central Poland, went on strike Tuesday demanding higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of renewed labor unrest is troubling to both Solidarity and the 
government, which has dealt with recent wage demands by quickly increasing 
wages and then printing more money. 
</P>
<P>
The government has temporarily frozen wages and prices, mostly in an effort to 
curb a series of small wildcat strikes that began to sweep Poland in April and 
May. But the government has indicated that prices will soon be increased 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one is certain how the militant Polish labor force will respond, 
there is concern that a serious outbreak of labor unrest could threaten the 
first power-sharing arrangement in the East Bloc.

LONDON-BASED REGIME UNSWAYED BY WARSAW'S REFORMS; 
</P>
<P>
EXILE PRESIDENT STILL DREAMS OF A FREE POLAND

<P>
It will be a sad day for Kazimierz Sabbat when Poland's National Assembly meets 
in Warsaw today to elect a president. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that its choice will in any way affect Sabbat, who contends that 
whatever happens, he will remain Poland's real president -- with the state seal 
to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
But even for someone who sees this week's events as a moral charade, it would 
be nice if the "pretender" were a man of different background. Instead, it 
appears that the two houses of the National Assembly will name Communist Party 
chief Wojciech Jaruzelski as president, with the blessing of Solidarity leader 
Lech Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very unpleasant situation -- a revolting situation, because 
(Jaruzelski) is responsible not only for martial law but for all that has 
happened in Poland for 30 years," said Sabbat, 76, who is president of the 
London-based Polish government-in-exile. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wartime Creation 
</P>
<P>
This other "government" that the retired sporting goods manufacturer heads is a 
creature of the World War II Nazi invasion of Poland and its postwar domination 
by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Formed in exile nearly half a century ago and pledged to return only when 
Poland is truly free, this government has remained in London rather than 
recognize what it considers an illegitimate Communist dictatorship maintained 
by force. To many, the refusal of the "Free Poles" to accept the admittedly 
brutal realities of postwar Europe is at best eccentric -- and at worst 
ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs is a "government" recognized by virtually no one except a close circle 
of anti-Communist Poles. The Vatican, which was the last political entity to 
officially honor their claim, quietly dropped their representative from its 
diplomatic list a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
The exile government's entire budget probably wouldn't keep the White House 
typing pool in coffee and doughnuts. It is run by people who haven't even set 
foot in Poland for almost 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, said Sabbat in a weekend interview. But, he insisted, the 
significance of his government is "more than meets the eye. . . . There is much 
of the symbol in what we are doing." 
</P>
<P>
The Polish exile government's goals remain the same as when it was established, 
said Sabbat: "To bring about free elections in Poland and a free Parliament. 
Our function will finish when in Warsaw there will be a really free and 
democratically elected Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
While admittedly a lot more representative than at any time in the last 50 
years, today's National Assembly in Warsaw doesn't meet the test. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of its virtually all-Solidarity Senate, the National Assembly by prior 
agreement still contains a majority for the Communist Party and its allies, 
noted Sabbat. The party also remains in control of the army and the security 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Even if this National Assembly were to choose Solidarity's Walesa as president, 
rather than Jaruzelski, it wouldn't change the situation. "I don't think Walesa 
would be suitable at this time," Sabbat said. 
</P>
<P>
The moment that there is a truly free election, the Polish exile government is 
committed to return the official seal and the original copy of the 1935 
constitution under which it claims legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it will be in my time, I do not know," Sabbat commented wistfully. "I 
wish I could perform that historic role, but. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meets at Residence 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government meets every Monday afternoon in the dining room of 
Sabbat's official residence in London's posh Belgravia section. The 
multimillion-dollar property at 43 Eaton Place is identified only by a modest 
brass plate on the door engraved in Polish: "President of the Republic of 
Poland." 
</P>
<P>
Sabbat, who divides his time between the Belgravia address and his private 
residence overlooking the Wimbledon Common park south of the Thames, is the 
fifth Polish president in exile. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the exile government's ministers, he was a young soldier when Nazi 
Germany invaded Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, triggering World War II. Dispersed 
Poles wound up fighting on many fronts -- Sabbat joined Polish forces in 
France. "Like most of us, I did not return to Poland" after the war, he 
recalled. "There was not much point." 
</P>
<P>
The Polish government-in-exile was formed in the early days of the war, based 
first in France and then, after Nazi forces occupied that country, in London. 
The first president was a prominent attorney and former Speaker of the Polish 
Parliament, the late Wladyslaw Rackiewicz, and the prime minister was the late 
wartime military hero, Gen. Wladyslaw Sikorski. 
</P>
<P>
Succession in the London government is guaranteed by a typically Polish article 
in that 1935 constitution granting the president the right to appoint his 
successor in the event of the country's being overrun. 
</P>
<P>
The government consists of eight ministers responsible to a Parliament-in-exile 
composed of representatives of Polish groups in the United States, Canada, 
Germany and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Its primary mission is to keep the dream of a free Poland alive. It maintains 
contacts with whatever Western opinion leaders will listen to it, tries through 
informants in Poland to stay on top of developments there and publishes both a 
quarterly magazine in English and a monthly newspaper in Polish. 
</P>
<P>
While some may snicker, the Communist authorities in both the Soviet Union and 
Poland acknowledge the importance of the government-in-exile, if only 
indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
During the original rise of the Solidarity trade union movement in 1980 and 
1981, the Soviet newspaper Literary Gazette blamed "the Eaton Place Cabinet" 
for allegedly directing nothing less than counterrevolution against the 
Communist government in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want to Repatriate Body 
</P>
<P>
And the Polish Communists have long wanted to repatriate Sikorski's body in 
hopes of reinforcing their claim to legitimacy. Sikorski, who died in a 
mysterious 1943 plane crash and is buried in England, said he wanted to be 
reburied in Poland only when his country was free. 
</P>
<P>
What the exile government here has to offer, in the end, is only its 
endorsement. But that endorsement, in a Polish context, is significant.

PROTESTERS IN MYANMAR FACE DEATH, PRISON

Authorities in Myanmar, formerly Burma, adopted stiff new penalties Tuesday for 
violations of martial law, providing for the death penalty and prison terms to 
be meted out on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
The measures were announced in the capital of Yangon, formerly Rangoon, on the 
eve of expected mass demonstrations marking Martyrs' Day. The demonstrations 
could provoke a confrontation between pro-democracy groups and the martial-law 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Martyrs' Day commemorates the assassination of the seven men who led Burma to 
independence from Britain in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Government radio announced that anyone accused of defying martial law, imposed 
last September, will now be tried by military courts. The military was 
empowered to impose summary sentences ranging from three years' imprisonment to 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
Under martial law, public gatherings of more than five people are prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has said she plans to lead a march today 
through the capital to the Martyrs' Mausoleum. She said that people from 104 
opposition parties are expected to take part and that "we will be marching in 
the thousands, but we shall be peaceful and disciplined." Aung San Suu Kyi is 
the daughter of one of the seven martyred leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The march, if it occurs, will be in defiance of the military government, which 
has invited Aung San Suu Kyi to take part in a government-sponsored observance 
of Martyrs' Day. 
</P>
<P>
Sound trucks roamed the streets of Yangon on Tuesday, warning residents to stay 
away from today's scheduled protest demonstrations. Several thousand people 
were killed last year when student-led demonstrations demanding increased 
democracy were forcibly dispersed by the Burmese army. 
</P>
<P>
There has been considerable disorder in the country since June, 1988, when Gen. 
Ne Win stepped down after 26 years as national leader. He had practiced an 
eccentric brand of socialism that left the country's economy in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Saw Maung took power in a coup last Sept. 18 and promptly cracked down on 
pro-democracy demonstrators, but the movement has been building again. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, military authorities announced that three members of Aung San Suu 
Kyi's party had been arrested in connection with a bomb attack at a government 
oil refinery. Three people were killed and two wounded in the July 7 attack. 
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested earlier this month after making a public speech 
critical of the Saw Maung government but was released not long afterward.

UNSEALED TUNNEL LEAKS 640,000 GALLONS OF OIL

An unsealed tunnel leading from a storage tank leaked up to 640,000 gallons of 
oil Tuesday, and nearly 300 gallons spilled into a waterway that leads to the 
Atlantic, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't sealed and why it wasn't sealed is something we are looking into," 
Coast Guard Capt. Robert C. North said. 
</P>
<P>
Between 420,000 and 640,000 gallons of oil poured from the tank, but most of it 
was contained on land by a system of earthen dikes, the Coast Guard and the 
state Department of Environmental Protection reported. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no threat to people," North said. "We're concerned about the 
environment if the tank should rupture." 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Gary Allen said the oil in the water was confined to a 
20-foot-by-80-foot area and was no more then 10 feet out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were vacuuming the oil from the Arthur Kill, the narrow waterway 
separating New Jersey from the New York City borough of Staten Island, using 
absorbent booms. 
</P>
<P>
"It is free-flowing oil, so it should not take more then a day to clean up," 
Allen said. He said the oil was fuel oil No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The spill was reported at a tank owned by Northville Industries. The tank is 
one of four near the edge of the Arthur Kill.

An attempt to ban smoking on all domestic airline flights suffered a setback 
Tuesday when a North Carolina congressman succeeded in watering down the 
proposed bill to instead merely extend the current smoking prohibition on 
flights of two hours or less. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that an "equitable solution" requires that we "have all the facts 
before enacting permanent legislation," Rep. Tim Valentine (D-N.C.) won 
approval from the House Public Works and Transportation Committee's 
subcommittee on aviation for extension of the current ban, which expires next 
April. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), author of the original measure, said 
that he hopes to restore tougher prohibitions to the legislation when it comes 
before the full committee later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Calling cigarette smoke a health hazard and the "worst sort of indoor 
pollution," he maintains that a ban on all domestic flights is justified. The 
Environmental Protection Agency, the American Medical Assn., the surgeon 
general, the National Academy of Sciences and the Assn. of Flight Attendants 
have endorsed such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
Congressmen from tobacco-growing states have contended evidence is lacking that 
second-hand smoke poses a problem on airliners.

Thomas Root, the Washington lawyer whose light plane crashed into the Atlantic 
Ocean while he sat at the controls apparently unconscious last week, has dozens 
of California clients who have invested money in applications for radio station 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Root, an attorney for Sonrise Management Services Inc., of Georgia, represents 
limited partners seeking FM band licenses in 16 outlying population centers in 
Northern and Central California. All Sonrise's license applications are now 
under investigation by the Federal Communications Commission. Both Root and 
Sonrise have denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Booker T. McClanahan Jr., hoping to become general manager of a 3,000-watt 
radio station on the Monterey Peninsula, started to become discouraged about 
the license application handled by Root and Sonrise when some of those who had 
invested in the application pulled their money out earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems With Root 
</P>
<P>
Then, a month ago, the former disc jockey and radio advertising salesman 
received a letter from Sonrise saying that there were problems with Root and 
suggesting that he find a new lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Root was telling us he was really good at getting the stations," 
McClanahan said in a phone interview, reached at an Assembly of God church in 
Seaside where he volunteers his time. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I thought he was a pretty prominent attorney around Washington, and I 
thought he had put a lot of people on the air." 
</P>
<P>
McClanahan, who has worked in advertising sales and on the air at various San 
Francisco and Monterey-area stations, still holds out hope that he can get the 
station he has always wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"Three-thousand watts is pretty big in the Carmel-Monterey area," he said. 
"That would have been pretty powerful. It would have got us over to Santa Cruz, 
and that's an hour drive." 
</P>
<P>
Root and Sonrise found investors in California through church contacts. They 
also tapped people with broadcast backgrounds who aspired to run their own 
stations. One said that he had heard of the investment from his financial 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buy Into Dream 
</P>
<P>
Investors could buy into the dream of winning an FCC license for slightly more 
than $3,000. They could profit if the station, once licensed, became a success. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Walker, a retired Missionary Baptist preacher in Pine Bluff, Ark., 
invested in partnerships seeking licenses in Ohio and Kansas. Walker said that 
although there was "no religious connection" to the investment, he knew that 
the Sonrise principals were Christians. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt better about it when I found out they were Christian," he said. He felt 
so confident that he told his niece, Kathleen Manning, a television producer in 
Bakersfield, about Sonrise, who also became involved. 
</P>
<P>
The day Root's plane went into the Atlantic, Manning received a letter from 
Sonrise, telling her that she should consider changing lawyers because of 
problems with Root. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit concerned," said Manning, a Bakersfield television producer 
who also is listed on the application as the intended general manager for a new 
FM radio station in Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
Manning invested no money in the project, but allowed Sonrise to use her name 
as general manager. She said one reason that Sonrise wanted to list her as the 
general manager was because she is a woman. The FCC has encouraged women and 
minorities to seek ownership of new stations.

A body found in the Mohawk River has been identified as the last missing victim 
of the 1987 collapse of a bridge on the New York State Thruway, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A boater spotted the body in the river near here Saturday, a sheriff's 
spokesman said. Relatives of Edward Meyer tentatively identified the body late 
Monday from keys, jewelry and clothing found on the remains, a state trooper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer was one of 10 people killed when rain-swollen Schoharie Creek eroded away 
bridge supports and six cars and one truck fell more than 80 feet on April 5, 
1987. The other bodies were recovered.

IRVINE PASSES LAW TO CURB DAMAGE TO OZONE LAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sweeping ordinance, thought to be the most comprehensive law in the nation 
restricting the chlorofluorocarbons and other compounds destroying the globe's 
protective ozone layer, was passed Tuesday night by the Irvine City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, approved 4 to 1, will affect businesses in the Orange County 
city that use or produce chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. That includes the 
electronics industry, installers of insulation, fast-food packaging firms, air 
conditioner and refrigeration repair firms and those that test fire 
extinguishing systems. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, who cast the dissenting vote, accused the 
city of imposing a "Big Brother mentality." She criticized the ordinance as 
fraught with problems. Residents will be unable to find air conditioner 
repairmen willing to invest in costly recycling equipment, required under the 
law, and small businesses will not be able to compete with others who are not 
restricted by the costly requirements, she maintained. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Larry Agran, who championed the ordinance with Councilman Cameron 
Cosgrove, countered that the depletion of the ozone layer is of global concern 
and that local cities can and should lead the way. With Irvine's large 
concentration of high-tech industries using CFCs, it is especially fitting that 
the city enact this law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Answering one businessman's argument that federal and international agencies 
are addressing the problem, Agran retored, "If we wait until all these people 
take action, we might as well kiss off the future of the globe." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance severely restricts the use of CFCs, Halon, and other substances 
that research has shown deplete the Earth's ozone layer, which protects the 
planet from harmful ultraviolet radiation. 
</P>
<P>
It also creates a position of environmental program coordinator to work with 
businesses to find alternative compounds and, where appropriate, grant 
exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 people addressed the council. Most represented businesses who oppose 
the ordinance, mostly on the grounds that the July 1, 1990, deadline for 
compliance is unrealistic or that no suitable alternative compounds are 
available. The ordinance was amended Tuesday to provide for an exemption 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe you will have a flood of exemptions," said Keith Lamb of ICI 
America, representing producers of CFCs. He asked that methyl chloroform -- a 
solvent not allowed under the ordinance -- be removed from the banned list 
because it is a good substitute for CFCs and has a lower ozone depletion level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price Increases Seen 
</P>
<P>
Scott Byington, an air conditioning serviceman, said the ordinance will 
increase the price of home air conditioner repairs by $140 to $200. 
</P>
<P>
Kasiuisuanatha Soundaranathan, a spokesman for Western Digital, said that if 
methyl chloroform is not allowed, his computer products firm -- which is 
building a $100-million facility in Irvine -- will lose its manufacturing 
capability "and its leading edge in the world market," despite the fact that 
the company meets all state and federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Agran responded: "The ordinance will not put you out of business. Just apply 
for an exemption, which puts the burden of proof on you."

The trip by Israeli newspaper and radio political correspondents is the latest

Arson investigators have identified a suspect in a mysterious fire that damaged 
the state Department of Savings &amp; Loan office in a Wilshire District 
building last March and forced the relocation of hundreds of state employees, a 
state fire official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out March 2 sometime before 3:30 a.m. on the 15th floor of the 
19-story CNA building at 600 S. Commonwealth Ave. Fire officials later said the 
blaze was the work of an arsonist but until now had not reported having singled 
out a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made but fire officials said they hope to file a complaint 
with the district attorney's office within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"In our minds, we know who lit the fire," said E. R. Scott Baker, criminal 
investigator for the state fire marshal's arson and bomb investigation unit. 
</P>
<P>
Baker would not elaborate further on motives but added that possible suspects, 
such as disgruntled employees, have been interviewed and discounted. The 
investigation, he said, has focused on one individual who had regular access to 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a State Employee 
</P>
<P>
"The person frequents the building and is in and out often. The suspect is 
knowledgeable and has access. We aren't talking breaking and entering. We are 
talking use of keys to get in doors." 
</P>
<P>
Baker added that the suspect is not a state employee. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the fire was deliberately set at a desk outside a computer workroom. 
The building, which is outfitted with an alarm system and is guarded, was 
locked at the time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A security guard reported the fire, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 employees from six state agencies were forced to find other office 
space after the fire, which damaged two offices, the S&amp;L facility and the 
state Banking Department. Some smoke and water damage was reported elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started in a crucial section of the S&amp;L agency where state thrift 
regulators analyze the data they develop from their examinations of 
state-chartered S&amp;Ls. But officials downplayed the seriousness of any loss. 
</P>
<P>
William Davis, chief deputy commissioner in the S&amp;L agency, said the fire 
destroyed documents from about 20 S&amp;Ls, including at least one that was 
seized by federal regulators and is being sued by bondholders for fraud. That 
has given rise to speculation that the fire might have been connected to probes 
into alleged illegal activity by S&amp;L companies. 
</P>
<P>
But both Davis and Baker said they did not believe that the suspect's motive 
was related to an S&amp;L probe. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said his office was still piecing together the amount and type of records 
that were destroyed in the fire. He said he believed that most of the documents 
that were damaged were duplicates and could be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fared Fairly Well' 
</P>
<P>
"It (the fire) caused us some problems in lost time in some examinations but, 
all in all, we fared fairly well," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said employees had updated their computer files the night before the 
fire, thus saving a lot of information that might have been lost in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The state had been leasing offices on nine floors of the CNA building for 
several agencies and for the governor. However, the lease had run out for all 
the agencies except the S&amp;L, according to Anne Garbeff, spokeswoman for the 
state Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
Employees from the six agencies -- S&amp;L, banking, corporations, insurance, 
commerce and emergency services -- have been working in temporary quarters 
since the fire but have begun to lease new office space. 
</P>
<P>
Airborne asbestos fibers were detected after the fire, but a sampling by 
CAL/OSHA found the level to be "within acceptable limits," spokesman Richard 
Stephens said.

L.A. SEEKS WAYS TO CUT DUMP USE; 
</P>
<P>
BUT COUNCIL STOPS SHORT OF AGREEING TO STATE LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After a seesaw two-hour debate on the city's mounting garbage crisis, the Los 
Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to prepare to scale back operations at Lopez 
Canyon Landfill, dumping ground for two-thirds of the city's trash. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council stopped short of agreeing to voluntarily comply with state 
restrictions that were issued last week against the city-operated dump, 
deciding to wait until after an Aug. 4 Los Angeles Superior Court hearing. The 
state Waste Management Board order called for limits on the landfill height, 
size and the number of daily truckloads dumped there. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, who introduced a motion to comply immediately, said the 
city ought to admit that it made mistakes at the Lake View Terrace dump and 
turn its efforts away from the courtroom and toward finding alternative trash 
disposal sites. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Long Fight 
</P>
<P>
"If we insist on staying in court, it could be years before we take care of 
this," said Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the East Valley district 
where the dump is located. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, council members supported Wachs' motion on a 12-1 vote. But most of 
them changed their minds, and their votes, after Deputy City Atty. Christopher 
M. Westhoff said they had crippled his ability to fight the state's order. 
</P>
<P>
"If the council votes to voluntarily comply, it makes my position moot," 
Westhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
On a 10-3 vote -- with Councilman Nate Holden joining Bernardi and Wachs in 
dissenting -- they decided to wait until Aug. 8 to reconsider Wachs' proposal 
to comply with the state order. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joy Picus, who opposed Wachs' motion, said the city cannot afford 
to rule out any trash-dumping options before it has to. She charged that state 
legislators and the state waste board are "out to get L.A." 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue here is the politics of garbage," Picus said. "We have to leave 
every possibility open, including Lopez Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the council asked the city Bureau of Sanitation to investigate four 
contingencies that could be used if the state's order stands: 
</P>
<P>
* Negotiating with alternative disposal sites, including a BKK Corp. facility 
in West Covina and the Chiquita Canyon Landfill in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
* Expanding the amount of city garbage allowed at Sunshine Canyon Landfill 
above Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
* Speeding up implementation of the citywide recycling program, scheduled to 
begin in August, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
* Reserving Lopez Canyon Landfill for the 3,000 tons of residential garbage 
thrown away daily, while locating other destinations for about 1,000 tons a day 
produced by the city streets and parks departments. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed against the state waste board Monday, the city maintains that 
the board's order unfairly upholds limitations included in a 1977 engineering 
report, incorporated into the dump operating permit a year later, but ignores a 
1983 engineering report that, among other things, increased the allowable 
height of garbage mounds at the Lopez Canyon Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The state waste board says that 1983 report was never formally adopted, a fact 
that the board acknowledges it did not realize until its staff began a review 
of the dump's permit earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1978 Limits 
</P>
<P>
Reinstituting the 1978 permit limits would mean cutting the landfill's height 
from 1,760 feet to 1,725 feet, reducing the number of trucks that travel there 
daily from 500 to 400 and removing garbage from areas outside the 140-acre 
trash boundaries, including some dumped on seven acres of National Forest 
Service land. 
</P>
<P>
Delwin Biagi, director of the city Bureau of Sanitation, said the lower height 
limits would cause Lopez Canyon to close within a year. He said sending the 
trash to private landfills will cost the city about $26 million a year in fees. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the Lopez Canyon dump who witnessed Tuesday's council meeting were 
disappointed. They want to see the landfill closed. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Ghiatis, who lives in Kagel Canyon, adjacent to the dump, said the 
council members "missed their chance to act responsibly" when they decided 
against voluntary compliance with the state order. 
</P>
<P>
"If these 15 gutless wonders spent as much time trying to solve the garbage 
crisis as they spend trying to cover their backsides . . . we wouldn't be here 
today," said Lewis Snow, vice president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners 
Assn.

COUNTY OKS ACQUISITION OF HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to spend $15 million 
to purchase and renovate the now-closed Clairemont Community Hospital, a move 
that is expected to alleviate the shortage of child and adolescent psychiatric 
beds that will be created by the 1992 closing of a leased psychiatric hospital 
in Loma Portal. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital on Mt. Etna Drive, which will offer predominantly psychiatric 
care, is scheduled to open in August, 1991. The county will spend $10.5 million 
to acquire it from Americare Partners and $4.5 million more on renovations. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we've got 39 children and adolescent beds at Loma Portal, and, when 
the new facility opens, that total will increase to 46," said William J. 
Burfitt, county deputy director of health. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors approved the acquisition despite strong objections from some 
neighbors. "We are adamantly opposed," Linda Maskovich told supervisors at a 
public hearing Tuesday. "This is not a good use for this property." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighbors' Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Susan Golding told Maskovich and other homeowners at the hearing 
that the county hopes to keep the hospital from becoming an eyesore or a 
security risk. "I know that there are concerns on behalf of the neighbors," 
Golding said. 
</P>
<P>
The renovated hospital, which will house 20 medical/surgical beds and 50 
general medical beds, will be operated as a "closed facility" that treats only 
patients admitted from other county-operated psychiatric facilities, Burfitt 
said. County residents seeking emergency care, for example, will still be 
served by the UC San Diego Medical Center in Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
The UCSD Medical Center has provided surgical and general medical care for the 
county since the mid-1960s, Burfitt said. County administrators believe the 
newly renovated facility's medical and surgical departments will help cut the 
county's health-care costs. They also expect San Diego's share of Medi-Cal 
funding to increase by about $1.1 million annually because the county, which 
holds only a psychiatric care license, will be granted a general hospital 
license to operate the Clairemont hospital. State regulations prohibit Medi-Cal 
payments for certain procedures unless they are done in a licensed general 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The renovated hospital would join the recently dedicated adult psychiatric care 
facility on Rosecrans Street, which soon will replace the 60-bed County Mental 
Health Hospital in Hillcrest.

REBURIAL OF INDIAN REMAINS DEMANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kumeyaay Indians want all Indian remains taken from the Mission San Diego de 
Alcala site reburied there immediately and plans for a meeting hall on the lot 
scrapped, their representatives told an attorney for the mission Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Kumeyaay presented a list of non-negotiable demands to mission attorney 
Jeff Brinton in talks held at the California Indian Legal Services (CILS) 
office, said Kumeyaay spokeswoman Fern Southcott. They include reburial of 
truckloads of bones and artifacts now stored at Balboa Park's Museum of Man in 
their original locations without further scientific study, Southcott said. 
</P>
<P>
Should the mission reject the demands, the Kumeyaay will take legal action, 
said the tribe's committee chairman, Ron Christman. "Our people are having a 
hard time with (this), because 90% of them are Catholic, but it's a graveyard 
we are talking about," Christman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Sought 
</P>
<P>
The Kumeyaay also asked that the mission rebury the remains according to Indian 
and Catholic traditions, post around-the-clock security on the site and share 
with the Kumeyaay all of its archeological data, according to Southcott. 
</P>
<P>
Mission spokesman William Finley refused comment on the demands, but said they 
would be carefully studied by mission priest Msgr. I. Brent Eagen. 
</P>
<P>
Kumeyaay attorney Robert Shull of CILS and representatives from the Native 
American Heritage Commission, the state attorney general's office, and the 
Luiseno and Cupeno Indian tribes also attended the session. 
</P>
<P>
Kumeyaay representatives said they were disappointed with the long-awaited 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
Southcott accused the diocese of making veiled threats to proceed without an 
agreement and of playing for time in the negotiations. "They are waiting for 
the adverse publicity they have received in the last couple of weeks to die 
down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we kind of got a runaround," Christman said. "The person they sent 
was a messenger, with no power to negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
But Brinton said he had as much latitude to negotiate as any client would give 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that there was anything to be disappointed about -- we haven't 
yet replied to their proposal," he said. Brinton also said he would try to meet 
with Eagen today to discuss the Indian demands. Brinton sought to reach a 
temporary compromise on the Kumeyaay remains while the project was suspended, 
Indian representatives said. Kumeyaay representatives denied his request to 
fill in the site with sand, Southcott said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Indians were meeting with church representatives in Escondido, the San 
Diego City Council held a closed session of its own on the controversy. The 
council will hold a public hearing Aug. 7 on the dispute, said councilwoman 
Judy McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Closed Session 
</P>
<P>
The second closed session by the council in as many weeks was held to determine 
whether the city could challenge the diocese project in court, said Assistant 
City Atty. Ron Johnson. No such action by the city is imminent, he added. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments, the National Park Service wrote a letter to Eagen asking 
him to leave the site as is and to build the meeting hall somewhere else. 
Building the hall on caissons would still damage the ruins of the original 
mission below, said associate regional director John D. Cherry of the National 
Park Service office in San Francisco. The park service has no authority over 
privately held National Historical Landmarks such as the mission, and can only 
offer advice, Cherry said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego chapter of the Sierra Club and the Save Our Heritage Organisation 
have also sided with project opponents.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD OKS CRITERIA FOR COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education has approved guidelines for selecting 
district representatives to a new central committee that will oversee 
decentralization efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Under the teachers' contract ratified last month, the district agreed to 
establish a 24-member council that would supervise the district's move into new 
forms of school governance that give teachers and parents a larger role in 
running schools. The committee will oversee new neighborhood school "shared 
decision-making councils," which were among the most controversial features of 
the contract. 
</P>
<P>
According to guidelines adopted Monday, five of the district's 12 appointees 
will be named by Supt. Leonard Britton and will include Deputy Supt. Sidney 
Thompson, a parent or community member and two principals. The other seven 
appointments will be made by board members and must be parents or community 
representatives. Under terms of the contract, the district must name its 
appointees by July 31. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 12 council seats will be filled by members of United Teachers-Los 
Angeles.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DANA URGES STEPS TO SAVE BURN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fearing that the threatened closure of a burn center at Torrance Memorial 
Hospital will leave the county with only two similar facilities, Supervisor 
Deane Dana announced a set of recommendations Tuesday to address the region's 
latest hospital crisis. It calls for taking steps to increase lobbying efforts 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"This facility and this service are vital to our community," Dana said in a 
motion he plans to introduce next week. "With large amounts of industry as well 
as unforeseen accidents, this service is one that must always be available 
locally." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gates, director of the county Department of Health Services, sent the 
supervisors a memorandum earlier this month alerting them that the hospital is 
considering closing its burn center "because of escalating uncompensated cost 
of treating uninsured burn patients." 
</P>
<P>
The escalating cost of treating the poor and uninsured has also been cited by 
hospitals that have left the county's crumbling trauma-care network. 
</P>
<P>
Dana noted that shutdown of the Torrance facility would leave the county with 
only two burn centers, Sherman Oaks Community Hospital and County-USC Medical 
Center.

As the foul ball sailed toward them in Dodger Stadium, Larry Barbee felt his 
father start to duck and he did the same. The next thing Larry felt was the 
ball wedged in his armpit. 
</P>
<P>
Larry, 24, is blind with retinitis pigmentosa. 
</P>
<P>
"It just stuck there -- isn't that unreal?" said his mother, Donna. "He was so 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Larry's uncle, Gary Barbee, who is the stadium's manager of ticketing, plans to 
have the ball autographed tonight by the player who hit it, Cubs catcher Mark 
Grace. 
</P>
<P>
Larry had to overcome one other challenge to keep his souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
"After he caught it some man tried to grab it," Donna Barbee said. "But Larry 
realized what he had and held on to it." 
</P>

A royal nose job? Responding to gossip in European magazines that Britain's 
Princess Diana is considering an anatomical adjustment, Dr. Stephen Pincus of 
Marina del Rey displayed computerized photos Tuesday to show how he could bring 
her nose "into harmony with the rest of her royal countenance." 
</P>
<P>
Namely, a little shortening here, some thinning there and a general 
straightening of the princess' proboscis. 
</P>
<P>
Pincus is sending his photos to the royal couple. 
</P>
<P>
Kensington Palace, meanwhile, is keeping a stiff upper lip. 
</P>
<P>
"A lien Nation," a new television series set in 1995 L.A., will follow the 
exploits of two cops -- one human, one extraterrestrial. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, not much has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Metro Rail will still be under construction, Mayor Bradley will still be 
mayor, and in one scene we'll have a detective stuck in traffic for two hours," 
said Ken Johnson, producer of the Fox Broadcasting show, adapted from the movie 
of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
One intriguing development, however, is the landing of thousands of 
extraterrestrials, called Newcomers, by space ships in the Mojave Desert. The 
Newcomers look human except for their heads, which are bald and sport red and 
purple squiggly lines, not to mention tiny ears. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first episodes concerns a prostitution ring of Newcomers who work 
Hollywood Boulevard because they aren't conspicuous there. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of odd spectacles, the proposed "Steel Cloud" monument over the 
Hollywood Freeway has been pelted by more than a few jokes. But not by 
Metropolitan Home, a glossy, upscale architecture and interior design magazine. 
A story in the latest issue declares that the 5-block-long, 5-to-14-story 
structure would be a kind of "healing arch" for downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the magazine points out, the city has "embarrassingly few public 
monuments . . . the Hollywood sign, Watts Towers, Griffith Observatory." 
</P>
<P>
Hey, what about our legendary 17-foot-long frankfurter next to the Beverly 
Center, the Tail of the Pup stand? 
</P>
<P>
Sue Calhoun of Studio City wonders if all of Southern California is trying to 
go Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
She pulled into the parking lot of a fish restaurant on Pacific Coast Highway 
the other night, only to be waived away. 
</P>
<P>
"The attendant told me, 'You can't come in,' " she said. "He was polite but 
firm. I told him I had reservations for dinner. I pointed out there were some 
empty parking spots. Then the attendant pulled out a piece of paper and asked, 
'Are you on the VIP parking list?' " 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun ate at another restaurant that didn't require parking reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost has even mellowed conservative hard-liner George Putnam, a longtime TV 
and radio commentator. How else do you explain the fact that Putnam, who was 
honored by the Board of Supervisors Tuesday on his 75th birthday, now 
broadcasts for radio station KIEV? 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle's comments in Long Beach on the space program moved 
comic Jay Leno to assert on NBC's "Tonight Show" that when Quayle "heard it was 
the 20th anniversary of the moon walk, he sent Michael Jackson a telegram."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGH-SPEED BIKE CHASE ENDS IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motorcyclist stopped by sheriff's deputies for turning without signaling led 
the deputies on a high-speed chase on and off the Foothill Freeway before the 
motorcycle crashed in Glendale, deputies said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Mills said that Carlos Hernandez, 18, of San Fernando, was 
treated for head and other injuries at Huntington Memorial Hospital. Hernandez 
was then transferred to the County-USC Medical Center jail ward, where he was 
arrested for suspicion of evading a police officer, causing serious bodily harm 
and reckless driving, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger, Daniel Castaneda of San Fernando, was being treated for serious 
injuries at Huntington Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Mills said that when two deputies stopped Hernandez and Castaneda after they 
turned right without signaling at Montrose and Ocean View avenues in La 
Crescenta, the pair fled onto the southbound lanes of the Foothill Freeway at 
speeds exceeding 100 m.p.h. About 50 minutes later, police were called to the 
Lincoln Avenue off-ramp of the Foothill Freeway, where Hernandez had crashed 
his motorcycle, Mills said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 24-HOUR STAFFING OF KENNELS SUGGESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to the death of 35 pets in a July 4 kennel fire in Pasadena, Los 
Angeles County supervisors Tuesday ordered animal control officials to study 
requiring round-the-clock staffing in kennels. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who asked for the study, has pneumonia and was 
absent from the meeting. His staff issued a statement saying that while the 
Pasadena kennel was absolved of any blame in the fire, "it is quite possible 
that some of the animals could have been saved had a kennel attendant or other 
employee been on duty." 
</P>
<P>
County law prohibits anyone from leaving a dog unattended for more than 12 
hours. However, the statement said, "at times, such as the Fourth of July, when 
large numbers of pets are boarded for the holiday, the potential for disaster 
increases dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Richards, assistant animal control director for the county, said that his 
office already has received complaints from kennel owners about the increased 
cost of the proposed requirement and is studying mandating sprinkler systems in 
kennels as an alternative.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DUAL FIRES AT CLINIC BLAMED ON ARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators have determined that arson caused the dual blazes in Hawaiian 
Gardens Sunday night that shut down an outpatient clinic operated by FHP Health 
Care, the health maintenance organization that also manages nearby Charter 
Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
There is no suspect and no motive for the fires, which broke out within two 
hours of one another in the clinic building on the hospital grounds, said Los 
Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Richard L. Love. He declined to reveal the type 
of physical arson evidence investigators found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was the second time in three weeks that fire has hit the medical office 
building at 21520 Pioneer Blvd. On June 28, a daytime fire that was confined to 
a janitor's closet caused the evacuation of about 285 patients and medical 
personnel.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Baldwin Park City Council has introduced an ordinance that would ban 
smoking in public areas of city buildings such as the council chamber, the City 
Hall lobby, restrooms and hallways. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance is similar to smoking bans adopted in Alhambra, Duarte, 
Pasadena and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike ordinances in other communities, the plan introduced by the council 
last week would not regulate smoking in restaurants and other private 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ban would expand the number of places where smoking restrictions 
are in force.

<P>
RULING ON MAKING COST OF MURDER DEFENSE PUBLIC IS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Describing the case as unique, a San Diego County judge Tuesday said he needed 
more time to rule on a prosecutor's request to make public the cost of 
defending a former auto mechanic convicted of murdering two San Diego police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in Superior Court, Judge Charles R. Hayes was asked to choose 
between the public's right to learn how it spends money defending people 
accused of murder and the time-honored rule protecting lawyers' secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes apparently will be the first California judge to interpret a provision in 
state law that keeps confidential the amount of public money spent for legal 
defense in death-penalty cases. That 1977 law sets up a process in capital 
cases by which a defense lawyer asks a judge for public funds to pay for 
"investigators, experts and others" that the lawyer feels would be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
The law itself does not say whether the secrecy should end when the case ends. 
Convicted murderer Joselito Cinco, 29, committed suicide in December in his 
cell at San Quentin, making his case one of the first to become final since the 
Legislature restored the death penalty in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Case 'More Final' 
</P>
<P>
"No case will ever be more final," Deputy Dist. Atty Howard H. Shore, who made 
the request to unseal the records, told Hayes. "If the records are not made 
available to the public in this case, it's safe to assume they never will be." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys, including John G. Cotsirilos, the San Diego lawyer who 
defended Cinco, complained to Hayes that what prosecutors are really trying to 
do with their request was score a political and tactical bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
Cotsirilos said he did not object to making public the lump sum expended on a 
case, reportedly nearing $1 million in Cinco's case. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the primary difference between a death-penalty case and other cases 
is the "emotion and semi-hysteria" unique to capital cases. Combining that 
emotion with an explicit description of the high cost of defense could fuel a 
drive to persuade the Legislature to change the law to give prosecutors a voice 
in how the defense of capital cases is funded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The tactical problem, Cotsirilos said, is that releasing the breakdown on even 
one case would enable prosecutors to learn how defense attorneys prepare in 
general for murder trials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Applications, Hearings Secret 
</P>
<P>
The law in question keeps secret not only the lawyer's application for funds 
but also any hearings the judge and lawyer may hold on the request. To divulge 
those conversations would mean revealing legal theories and strategy, and the 
law traditionally has protected that information, Cotsirilos said in legal 
papers he filed before the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's hearing, Hayes asked Cotsirilos whether he would object to the 
disclosure of names and fees of experts and investigators who testified at 
trial but keep private the names of those he consulted but didn't call at 
trial. Cotsirilos said that would be redundant, since prosecutors already know 
who testified in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Shore urged Hayes to make everything -- the figures, the documentation and 
transcripts of any hearings -- public, citing the rule that court records are 
usually public records. "We feel the public should be able to scrutinize this 
process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shore said it is nonsense to say prosecutors sought defense lawyers' tactical 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine why they think we think there's some dark, mysterious secret 
they have that will make our lives easier," he said. "That's preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Accountability 
</P>
<P>
Supporting Shore was Marilyn L. Huff, a San Diego lawyer who filed a 
friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the San Diego Union and Tribune 
newspapers asking for release of the records. She also relied on the rule 
making most court records public. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case about public accountability," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis A. Wenzell, a San Diego defense lawyer who wrote a 
friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the Criminal Defense Lawyers Club of San 
Diego and the Criminal Defense Bar Assn., groups of about 70 and 200 attorneys, 
respectively, said the papers had a different interest. 
</P>
<P>
"What the (two newspapers) want is a public uproar about what it costs to kill 
people in this state," Wenzell said. "They have no interest in the cost to the 
court or the prosecution of these cases." 
</P>
<P>
Huff denied that, saying the papers would be interested in the cost of 
prosecution as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Written Opinion 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, a former San Diego County deputy district attorney who moved to the 
Municipal Court bench in February, 1986, and the Superior Court in December, 
1987, gave no indication when he would rule. He said he will write an opinion 
announcing his decision, a somewhat uncommon step for a Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Any decision Hayes might announce in the near future would not take effect 
until Cotsirilos completes a "complete accounting" of the money, the only 
reference in the state law to the end of a case. That accounting is under 
review, Cotsirilos said. 
</P>
<P>
Cinco was convicted and sentenced to die in June, 1988, for killing two police 
officers in Balboa Park on Sept. 14, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Because of extensive publicity, Cinco's trial was moved to Orange County, where 
a jury found him guilty of the murders, which occurred when Cinco and another 
man were trying to avoid misdemeanor citations for providing liquor to two 
teen-age girls.

RED CROSS HELP IN EMERGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Red Cross is the nation's official volunteer disaster relief 
organization. It responds to disasters of all types to help mitigate the 
suffering of those affected. 
</P>
<P>
The East San Gabriel Valley Chapter did just that July 3, when fire raced 
through the canyons of Hacienda Heights, destroying homes and causing families 
to flee. Trained disaster workers, some volunteers, some paid staff, worked 
around the clock to provide emergency assistance to these families. 
</P>
<P>
A shelter was opened at Los Altos High School and approximately 2,000 meals 
were served for disaster victims and emergency workers. When the fire was out, 
additional immediate assistance was offered to those who needed it, including 
food, temporary housing, clothing, medical aid, information and referral to 
government agencies that can give further assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Many smaller Red Cross chapters, such as the East San Gabriel Valley chapter, 
may have limited financial and human resources, however, no disaster is too 
large for them to handle. This is because they can, at any time, call upon the 
resources of the entire organization and their community. 
</P>
<P>
I'm pleased to say that our neighboring chapters assisted us, and that the 
involvement of the community in supporting us was outstanding. We wish to thank 
them for this help. 
</P>
<P>
All American Red Cross disaster assistance is an outright gift, made possible 
by voluntary contributions for the American people. And, the East San Gabriel 
Valley Chapter will continue to assist those affected by the Hacienda Heights 
fire as long as our help is needed.

BUSH'S VISIT TO POLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The speech by President Bush before the newly elected Polish Parliament was 
both encouraging and practical (Part I, July 11). It set the tone for our 
potential involvement in the development of other Eastern Bloc nations seeking 
an independent direction from that of the Soviets. As the President noted, 
these are indeed exciting times, but not without peril. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev seem to be accommodating the need for 
new strategies in the face of economic pressures. The road to general 
disarmament is slowly being paved. It might be interesting for both NATO and 
the Warsaw Pact members to consider evolving from instruments of military 
balance to ones of economic stability. 
</P>
<P>
As the arduous process of diminishing both conventional and nuclear forces 
continues, it seems that the NATO countries and the Warsaw Pact might utilize 
their manpower, their machinery, and their vast facilities to support the 
concepts of Gorbachev's initiatives and our own aspirations for a peaceful and 
prosperous Europe. The process of Marxist determinism emerging into systems 
based on free enterprise will be tough enough on all of us. What is to say that 
once Hungary and Yugoslavia are independent entities that they will not 
rekindle historic rivalries and start their own little war? 
</P>
<P>
For all their abrasive effect, NATO and the Warsaw Pact gave two large areas of 
the world a certain, if not altogether desirable, stability. Disarm? Certainly. 
Pull out? Maybe not altogether. Let us redeploy our huge military investment 
into a force for economic growth while building bridges of trust and preventing 
ancient intolerance from impairing our efforts.

WHERE'S SOLIDARITY FOR AMERICANS?; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR IS LOSING ITS GREATEST WEAPON, THE RIGHT TO STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN TASINI, Jonathan Tasini is a writer based in New York who 
specializes in labor and economics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The violent scene is all too familiar. Striking workers are dragged away by 
hundreds of police officers and security guards armed with automatic weapons. 
Workers and their families are harassed by government authorities and hired 
thugs. Union leaders are thrown in jail and fined for practicing peaceful civil 
disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
The place is not Poland and the union is not Solidarity, which President Bush 
flew thousands of miles to salute as a beacon of freedom. This battle is taking 
place just a few hundred miles from the White House in the coal fields of 
Virginia and three other states. And it is a fight that underscores how 
American workers arguably have fewer rights than Polish workers. 
</P>
<P>
On April 5, members of the United Mine Workers of America struck the Pittston 
Co. mines in Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee after failing to 
agree to a new contract. By all measures, Pittston is a renegade company. It 
refused to sign a reasonable agreement reached between the UMW and the 
Bituminous Coal Operators Assn. Last year, it cut off health-care coverage to 
retirees and disabled miners. Even the National Labor Relations Board, no 
friend of organized labor, has charged Pittston with bargaining in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
While the company's actions make a mockery of labor-management relations, the 
power wielded by the state against the strikers is far more troubling. The UMW 
has been fined several million dollars for exercising the legal right to strike 
Pittston. By contrast, Pittston was fined just $47,000 for a mine explosion in 
1983 that killed seven miners. By court orders, strikers may not picket en 
masse in front of the company's gates. Judges in Virginia and West Virginia 
have issued injunctions making it illegal to drive below the speed limit -- a 
peaceful tactic used by the miners to slow down coal trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Although these rulings may seem aberrations, they are an example of a recent 
trend that is ruining labor-management relations. Meaningful collective 
bargaining can take place only in an atmosphere of equal power. To win wage 
hikes and better working conditions, workers have to be legally able to place 
economic pressure on companies, usually by withholding their work. Otherwise, 
companies have no incentive to strive for a fair contract. 
</P>
<P>
But, for all intents and purposes, the right to strike is dead in this country. 
The Supreme Court has ruled that companies can permanently replace their 
workers during a strike. As a result, in the last few years unions have jumped 
through hoops to avoid sending their members to the picket line. For many 
workers, striking has meant the end of a job held for 20 or 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Now, even abandoning the strike won't protect workers. The NLRB recently 
decided that a company can simply lock out its workers and permanently replace 
them, even if they want to stay on the job and do not want to strike. Added to 
court injunctions and huge fines, lockouts and the threat of permanent 
replacements have tipped the balance of power overwhelmingly to management's 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Companies have barely been able to contain their glee at the new legal 
environment, but in their rejoicing they must be under the spell of a severe 
case of amnesia. The legal frameworks -- especially the National Labor 
Relations Act of 1947 -- were set up as much to protect companies as to even 
the balance between labor and management. In the 1930s and 1940s, labor 
militancy sent millions of workers into the streets; production at auto, steel, 
rubber and coal facilities was regularly disrupted. The country's economic 
system stood face-to-face with an angry working class ready to revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Labor laws restored order. Although the postwar labor laws significantly 
favored management, union members felt that the system provided them some kind 
of protection. They bought into the process, which was always designed to 
protect the free-market system. 
</P>
<P>
We now appear to have come full circle. The rush to eviscerate labor laws and 
bring down the full weight of the law on workers can only lead to a new 
militancy reminiscent of the 1930s. True, union leaders generally seem cowed 
and paralyzed from taking dramatic action. But, frustrated and disgusted by a 
declining standard of living, rank-and-file workers will press harder and 
rupture what is left of the collective bargaining process. 
</P>
<P>
The signs are already there. A few unions routinely avoid the NLRB and labor 
laws in their organizing drives. In the last several years, union members have 
rejected contracts that their leaders have negotiated, threatening open 
defiance if better deals are not reached. In the Pittston strike, tens of 
thousands of miners have staged wildcat walkouts, against the wishes of their 
union, in support of the Pittston workers. 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that flag-waving politicians will embrace labor rights in 
Poland and the right to protest in China because they can also seize the 
opportunity to bash communist governments. President Bush sees Americans having 
a "special kinship with those who dream of a better future" in Poland. Those 
words ring hollow, however, to workers in the United States who cannot legally 
strive to improve their economic future.

TRIAL ORDERED FOR MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING WIFE, STAGING CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Tarzana man who insisted that his attorney conspired with prosecutors to 
falsely convict him of killing his wife is mentally competent to stand trial, a 
San Fernando Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After examining Robert Peernock, 51, four court-appointed psychiatrists 
concluded that he understands the nature of the court proceedings against him 
and can contribute to his defense. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the evaluations, Judge John H. Major ruled that Peernock must 
stand trial on charges that he beat his wife to death, tried to kill his 
daughter and then staged a car crash to make their deaths appear accidental. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Peernock's estranged wife, Claire Laurence Peernock, 45, of Saugus, 
and his oldest daughter, Natasha Peernock Sims, 18, were found in July, 1987, 
in Claire Peernock's car, which had been doused with gasoline and had struck a 
utility pole. Police concluded that the accident was staged with the idea that 
the car would burst into flames when it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy on Claire Peernock revealed that she had died before the crash of a 
type of head wound not associated with traffic accidents. The Los Angeles 
County medical examiner's office concluded that her head injuries had been 
inflicted with a blunt instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Peernock, a former pyrotechnical engineer for a movie studio, was arrested in 
September, 1987, and pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, attempted murder, 
arson and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Sims testified in a preliminary hearing that her father had handcuffed her, put 
a hood over her head, force-fed her alcohol and put her in the back seat of her 
mother's car before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Major ordered a competency hearing for Peernock after Peernock 
interrupted a proceeding eight times, insisting that his attorney Gerald L. 
Fogelman was conspiring with prosecutors. Fogelman said at the time that his 
client was incapable of cooperating in a defense. 
</P>
<P>
Peernock, according to court documents, believes that authorities want to frame 
him because he exposed a system of kickbacks by officials in the Department of 
Water Resources. 
</P>
<P>
Peernock recently hired a new attorney, Felipa R. Richland, and the 
psychiatrists said he will cooperate with her as long as he trusts her. They 
also said he clearly understands the nature of the proceedings against him, 
noting he has "superior intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has an almost paranoid distrust of institutional authority, it has 
not rendered him irrational, Dr. William McAdoo said in his report. 
</P>
<P>
If he had been found mentally incompetent, Peernock could have been sent to a 
state mental hospital for an indefinite period.

PALMDALE IS STATE'S FASTEST GROWING CITY FOR 3RD STRAIGHT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the third straight year, Palmdale has been named the fastest growing of the 
448 incorporated cities in California, a research group said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The survey by the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, an 
independent research firm in Palo Alto, showed that Palmdale grew from a 
population of 17,396 in 1984 to 45,859 at the end of 1988. The city has added 
about 3,000 residents since then. 
</P>
<P>
The center said the new residents are being drawn by relatively low home prices 
and the area's potential for job growth. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting a lot of home buyers who want more house for their money," said 
Steve Buffalo, a spokesman for the city. An estimated 90% of new Palmdale home 
buyers are commuters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is an hour or more from downtown Los Angeles. However, the drive can 
take much longer in traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale achieved the top-growth ranking based on five-year gains of 164% in 
population, 169% in assessed property valuation and 115% in retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
City officials expect Palmdale's growth to continue. During the first five 
months of this year, more than $200 million worth of building permits were 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
That figure does not include a 77-acre auto mall or a 1 million-square-foot 
retail shopping mall, both scheduled to open in late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, some jobs are coming to Palmdale. In April, as part of a 
corporate restructuring, Lockheed Corp. announced that it would start 
transferring about 7,000 jobs from its facilities in Burbank to Palmdale and 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Moorpark in Ventura County was the third-fastest growing city 
behind Moreno Valley in Riverside County.

JUDGE REBUFFS TUNA BOATS' BID TO BAN WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in San Diego has dismissed three lawsuits by tuna boat 
operators aimed at keeping female observers of porpoise killings off their 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
The tuna boat operators, Dominic Castagnola, Caribbean Marine Service and 
Caroline M. Corp., said female government observers violate the privacy of 
all-male crews. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge William B. Enright said claims of a violation of privacy 
"merely constitute inconvenience." Enright issued a summary judgment on the 
actions July 7. 
</P>
<P>
Enright said the tuna boat operators had provided no evidence of privacy 
violations from crew members who sailed with a female observer on previous 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
The observers are marine biologists who are placed on board U. S. tuna purse 
seiners by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to monitor the 
number of porpoises killed during fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Enright noted that Department of Commerce regulations providing for basic 
living accommodations for male and female observers are neither "arbitrary, 
capricious or violative of the crew members' constitutional right to privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Enright had granted two preliminary injunctions in 1987 barring female 
observers from certain vessels until the privacy questions could be sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the injunctions in April of 1988, 
citing regulations concerning living accommodations for the observers. 
</P>
<P>
James Stevens, Caribbean Marine Service Co.'s attorney, said he might appeal 
the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration could not be 
reached for comment.

The hearing for a San Diego snake breeder whose home was raided by 
animal-control officers last month was continued Monday until late July. 
</P>
<P>
John Humphrey, the department's hearing officer, said he has asked zoo 
officials to help draft animal-control guidelines for en forcing the city 
ordinance barring "dangerous snakes". 
</P>
<P>
In the hearing, San Carlos resident Gary Sipperley is seeking the return of 19 
large snakes confiscated by county animal control after a June 28 search of his 
home.

<P>
A 36-year-old inmate escaped from County Jail in El Cajon after he kicked a 
hole through a wall, then used a rope made of bed sheets to climb down seven 
floors, the Sheriff's Department reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The escape of John J. Peugh, who was in custody on suspicion of burglary and 
possession of stolen property, was discovered Tuesday morning by a deputy on 
his way to work. 
</P>
<P>
Peugh, who escaped sometime between late Monday night and early Tuesday 
morning, apparently removed a ceiling fan in the day room in his module and 
crawled through the duct until he came to the outside wall, a Sheriff's 
Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Peugh then made a 3-by-5-foot hole in the wall and climbed down from the 
seventh floor, a distance of about 130 feet, on the rope of bed sheets, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Peugh was last accounted for at 10:25 p.m. Monday.

AROUND THE VALLEY: CUSTOMERS SAMPLE THEIR INVISIBLE WOMEN LIKE DISHES AT A 
SMORGASBORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alonely Marine one recent Sunday afternoon dialed a phone number seeking the 
long-legged goddess he had seen in an ad in a girlie magazine. He thought he 
was speaking with Blondie, one of those silky women with blonde hair and fat in 
all the right places who glide through men's fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
But the fair-haired damsel of the serviceman's dreams doesn't exist, except as 
a picture bought from a modeling agency. 
</P>
<P>
Blondie was portrayed on the phone by Molly Silverman, a bald, 50-year-old Van 
Nuys housewife who is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that has taken her 
left breast and riddled her liver. 
</P>
<P>
Molly and her husband, Lou, whose names have been changed here at their 
request, estimate that in the five years before Molly became ill, she 
entertained more than 100,000 telephone callers from the kitchen table of her 
townhouse near the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Now tugging on her wig to keep it from slipping further down her lined 
forehead, Molly took the first of the three calls she is able to handle a day. 
</P>
<P>
"A Marine, my God, I'm in deep lust," she said huskily. She picked up a pencil 
from an Early American table and idly drew triangles and flower petals on a set 
of instructions for hooking up cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
"What do I look like? Well, I'm five-seven with green eyes and a real great 
body." 
</P>
<P>
With her 5-foot-2 body straining at the seams of her housedress, Molly quickly 
directed the conversation into the unprintable, punctuated by throaty gasps, 
moans and kisses into the receiver. She gave the Marine a frank description of 
her fanciful body and gazed absently at a lamp whose bronzed base is a youth 
playing a lyre. 
</P>
<P>
Molly's three-story townhouse contains a number of such objects, including an 
ebony replica of Rodin's thinker, a gum-ball machine and a white china lion 
keeping guard on the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
Six minutes after the conversation began, Molly wished the satisfied Marine a 
happy Fourth of July weekend and told him her "special number," one of three 
lines in the townhouse hooked up to a Los Angeles switchboard. 
</P>
<P>
A caller must be over 18 and must provide his date of birth, Social Security 
number, bank guarantee and credit card numbers before Molly's employer will 
permit her to call back, collect. Aside from that, all that's needed is about 
$40 and a telephone to reach out and pretend to touch someone. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Blondie, Molly plays, among others, Julie, a large black woman; 
Marie, a flirtatious French maid, and Ginger, a sultry Southern belle. She's 
good with accents, which she says helps in a business whose customers sample 
their invisible women like dishes at a smorgasbord. 
</P>
<P>
The couple say Molly made about $100,000 on the phone last year by working as 
many as 36 hours at a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
She's usually extremely secretive about how she makes a living, not because she 
is ashamed, she said, but because most people regard it as a "sleaze business." 
Her six children, aged 24 to 32, know what their mother does, but everyone else 
thinks she is a telephone solicitor -- the kind that sells magazine 
subscriptions, not pleasure, through fiber optics. 
</P>
<P>
Lou says Molly is always imagining that acquaintances in the tree-lined 
neighborhood are among her callers. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started out I did it all -- bestiality, incest, rape, violence 
against children," Molly says. "But it made me sick, so most of the calls I 
take now are from successful men in stressful jobs who want to take a break and 
be dominated." 
</P>
<P>
"I told her, 'Let's face it. What you really are is a phone hooker,' " Lou 
said. "She can get a corpse excited. But that kind of talk doesn't do a thing 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big help. He has a vivid imagination," Molly said, casting Lou an 
adoring look. "The first time I did it he wrote me a script, and he coaches me 
now to make sure I don't get stale. You can get into a rut doing this." 
</P>
<P>
At first it was fun, Molly says, but now she gets tired. 
</P>
<P>
She brought out a picture of herself taken four months ago at her daughter's 
wedding, before the cancer made her hollow-eyed and sallow. The woman in the 
snapshot is wearing a low-cut peach gown that sets off her dark hair, glossy 
skin and full figure. 
</P>
<P>
Even a glowing Molly bears little resemblance to most of the characters she 
plays. The only exception, she says, is the weekly call she gets from a man in 
New York whose dream woman is middle-aged. 
</P>
<P>
Lou is a retired pizza parlor owner whom she supports while he tries to make it 
as an actor. He says she's a frustrated actress who has found herself in her 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Once a housewife and helper in the family business, Molly became a phone sex 
operator to escape boredom after the couple retired and moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw an ad in the LA Weekly that said make money from your home," Molly said 
in her natural nasal voice. "I called, and they said you had to be very 
explicit and talk sex. I said, 'I'm from New York. Talking dirty doesn't bother 
me.' "

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EMBEZZLER SENTENCED FOR VIOLATING PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former fund-raiser for Retinitis Pigmentosa International, who embezzled 
$50,000 from the charity, was sentenced Tuesday to eight months in prison for 
violating his probation by committing another crime. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Sherman Juster ordered Daniel Jay Sonners, 28, to 
serve the eight months consecutively with a two-year sentence imposed last 
month for an unrelated burglary. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Juster had sentenced Sonners to four years probation after he 
pleaded guilty to grand theft from the charity. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea agreement, Sonners was to repay the Woodland Hills 
organization by Dec. 8, 1989, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pargament said. 
</P>
<P>
Sonners had returned $25,000 of the money, Pargament said, when he was arrested 
Feb. 7 on suspicion of burglarizing a private postal office in Westwood on Jan. 
19 and Jan. 22. He pleaded guilty to one count of burglary of the office. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Sonners' incarceration, the charity will not be able to recover 
the remaining $25,000, Pargament said.

Los Angeles police arrested a 24-year-old man Tuesday in the execution-style 
murder of his father in Sylmar on July 4. They also arrested an alleged 
accomplice and are searching for a third man believed to have plotted to kill 
the victim for financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Godlewski Jr. of Montrose was arrested while being questioned at the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill station, Lt. Bernard Conine said. 
</P>
<P>
Later Tuesday, police arrested Michael Brown, 21, at his Palmdale apartment. 
Brown's roommate, Gene Marshall Flack, 23, was being sought in connection with 
the murder, Conine said. The three men, believed to be companions from high 
school, conspired to kill the senior Godlewski to claim the man's life 
insurance and other property, Conine said. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Joseph Godlewski, 45, was shot once in the upper body at the entrance 
to his home in the 13400 block of Trego Street about 2 a.m. July 4, police 
said. A gardener discovered the man's body about six hours later, authorities 
said. Police said they found a gun believed used in the slaying on the front 
yard of the house. 
</P>

Conine said the senior Godlewski, who earned an upper middle-level income, was 
a machinist and ran a mail-order shipping business from the garage of his 
two-story home, where he lived by himself. Conine said the man manufactured 
nylon binding devices with plastic buckles. He said he did not know what the 
devices were used for. 
</P>
<P>
Police made the arrests after serving search warrants at the suspects' 
residences and at two homes in San Fernando, which Conine said the men 
frequented. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Conine said police initially thought that the senior Godlewski might have taken 
his own life, "but the more we got into it, the more it looked like murder." 
Authorities refused to say which of the three they believe shot Godlewski. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Godlewski and Brown were being held at the Foothill Division Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Flack is described as six feet tall and weighing 160 pounds, with blond hair 
and brown eyes.

DONNIE MOORE DIES IN APPARENT SUICIDE; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE SAY FORMER ANGEL RELIEVER REPEATEDLY SHOOTS AND CRITICALLY WOUNDS WIFE, 
THEN TURNS GUN ON SELF

<P>
Former Angel relief pitcher Donnie Moore died Tuesday after he repeatedly shot 
and critically wounded his estranged wife, then turned the handgun on himself 
in their Anaheim Hills home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent suicide and murder attempt came about a month after the 
35-year-old pitcher was released by the Omaha Royals, a minor league club for 
which he played briefly after being dropped by the Angels last September. 
Neighbors and relatives said the couple had quarreled frequently in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's 35-year-old wife, Tonya, suffered at least three gunshot wounds to the 
upper chest and abdomen. She was driven by her 17-year-old daughter, Demetria, 
to Kaiser Permanente Foundation Hospital near their home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's wife collapsed and lost consciousness after arriving at the hospital 
and was rushed into surgery Tuesday evening, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Demetria and her two brothers -- Donnie Jr., 10, and Ronnie, 7 -- were at the 
house when the gunshots were fired, but none of them were hit, police said. The 
children were taken in by relatives and friends after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Friends, neighbors and relatives reacted with shock and horror. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot more hurt down there than any of us probably realized," said 
Angel broadcaster Joe Torre, who managed Moore when he was with the Atlanta 
Braves from 1982 to 1984. "He tried to come back, he tried to come back and he 
finally got cut loose." 
</P>
<P>
Despite achieving some success during his 13-year major league career, Moore 
may be best remembered for one pitch in Game 5 of the 1986 American League 
championship series, when he gave up a home run that helped the Boston Red Sox 
beat the Angels and go on to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police, responding to calls reporting gunshots at the couple's house at 
about 4:40 p.m. Tuesday, discovered Moore sprawled on the kitchen floor with a 
single bullet wound to his head. A .45-caliber semiautomatic gun was found near 
the body, but not in Moore's hand, Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said. 
Bullet holes riddled the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said that at least one of Moore's children witnessed the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the evidence found at the scene and statements from witnesses, all 
indications are that Donnie Moore and his wife, Tonya, became involved in an 
argument and during the argument, Mr. Moore produced a handgun, shot his 
estranged wife and then turned the gun on himself," Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said the department was unaware of any past domestic disputes at the 
Moore residence. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said Tonya Moore had come to the house to visit her children sometime 
in the afternoon Tuesday. The children were playing in and out of the house 
when the couple began arguing. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Tonya Moore rushed outside to tell her children that their father 
had hit her, Hedgpeth said. The fight continued off and on. The children told 
police that after one heated discussion, Moore came into the kitchen with the 
gun. After the two exchanged words, Moore started shooting. 
</P>
<P>
At the hospital, a woman who identified herself only as Tonya Moore's sister 
said she talked with Tonya earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
"We spoke earlier today and they were having a spat," the woman said. Asked why 
the shooting might have occurred, she said, "If I knew why . . . " She couldn't 
finish, and simply shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Johnson, attorney for the Moore family, said the family has experienced 
minor problems, and said that Moore was "somewhat upset . . . despondent" about 
his release from the Kansas City Royals' triple-A team. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the family had been discussing moving from the Anaheim Hills home 
and going to Texas, where both Moore and his wife have relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors described Moore as a quiet man who often played basketball with his 
sons near the garage of the couple's ranch-style home that sprawled over two 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
But the Moores had experienced marital problems in recent months, neighbors 
said. The couple separated in mid-June, they said, about the same time that 
Moore was released after only seven games with the triple-A club in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Christensen, 47, said Moore was "very emotional over what was 
happening to his life." 
</P>
<P>
"You just feel so emotional for him, especially for what he went through," 
Christensen said. "I guess maybe he thought he lost it all." 
</P>
<P>
Her 16-year-old son, Keith, said he visited Moore often to talk about baseball 
and play with his sons, but noticed tension between the couple. They had 
separated, and Tonya Moore moved from the residence to Ontario by late June. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed real quiet," Keith Christensen said. "Almost every day, I would come 
over and talk to him. He would talk, but you would have to start the 
conversation." 
</P>
<P>
Tonya Moore told one neighbor, Betty Bailey, that she wanted to leave her 
husband last November. "I didn't get involved because I thought they were 
taking care of it," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Moore's pitching performance and his marriage seemed to unravel after the 
American League playoffs in 1986. He fell victim to a variety of injuries and 
his pitching suffered in the years that followed. In September of 1988 he was 
released by the Angels, but was signed in May by the Royals' triple-A club. He 
was released June 12. 
</P>
<P>
"He never seemed entirely happy about anything," said Frank Adkisson, radio 
announcer for the Omaha Royals. "The guy was set for life financially. Whether 
he could still play or not, he had everything going for himself financially." 
</P>
<P>
Adkisson said Moore primarily kept to himself during his short time in Omaha, 
going so far as to pay extra so he could room alone on the road, an unusual 
practice in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the guys told me after he heard the news (of Moore's death) that Donnie 
seemed like he was feeling bitter about something," Adkisson said. "Some of the 
other guys were speculating that he just seemed unhappy. Maybe it was sinking 
in on him that he wasn't able to pitch anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Although he pitched well during his first four appearances with Omaha, Moore 
was ineffective during his last few outings with the team, Adkisson said. He 
gave up five hits and three runs in 1 2/3 innings June 11, then was released by 
the team the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Pinter, Moore's agent, said he spoke with Moore earlier Tuesday and the 
two talked about plans of him making a comeback in the winter leagues in Puerto 
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Pinter also said the Houston Astros were interested in the relief pitcher, 
telling him that they would get him a triple-A spot as soon as something opened 
up and perhaps could bring him up in September. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't going to give up," Pinter said. "He was a fighter."

REDS' KAL DANIELS GOES TO DODGERS FOR LEARY, DUNCAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sacrificing pitching for potential, the Dodgers traded 1988 pitching hero Tim 
Leary and infielder Mariano Duncan to the Cincinnati Reds Tuesday for 
struggling outfielder Kal Daniels and rookie infielder Lenny Harris. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers said goodby to a pitcher who helped take them to the world 
championship but no longer fit into their rotation. They are greeting a hitter, 
Daniels, who they hope can fill their hole at the top of the batting order. And 
for now, everybody is happy. 
</P>
<P>
I would definitely rather start somewhere else than be in the bullpen here," 
Leary said after hearing the news Tuesday. "There's going to be some great 
memories from the 1988 year. . . . I just hope if there are fans out there who 
have any protests, don't be afraid to speak up." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, who will not address the LA media until today, told reporters in 
Cincinnati: "I guess it's good for me because I get to play on grass. That's 
good because of my knees." 
</P>
<P>
Upon a close look, it is a deal smudged with imperfections. Yet the Dodgers 
prefer to look at the big picture. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels is coming off the latest of four knee surgeries. He is hitting just 
.218 with two homers and nine RBIs in 133 at-bats. He has been booed and 
sometimes benched. The left-handed hitter has recently done so poorly against 
left-handed pitchers, he has played only against right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet at age 25, he entered this year with a .311 career average in parts of 
three seasons. He has an average of 22 homers and 64 RBIs in each of his two 
full years. Last season he led the league with a .397 on-base percentage, a 
most important statistic to the Dodgers considering he will enter the lineup 
tonight as their much-needed leadoff hitter while playing left field. 
</P>
<P>
And Daniels said he will love Los Angeles. Or at least what he thinks is Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to see me on the Cosby Show," Daniels said Tuesday, which might 
be inconvenient considering the show is filmed in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, meanwhile, is hitting .223 with two homers and 11 RBIs in just 41 
starts. He has committed 13 errors, more than Alfredo Griffin (seven) and 
Willie Randolph (three) combined. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as a natural third baseman who can play shortstop and second base, he will 
neatly fill the utility role vacated by Duncan and perhaps eventually challenge 
third baseman Jeff Hamilton for a starter's job. He has speed -- he has 
averaged 33 steals in each of his last five minor league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
And he has perspective. When he was in elementary school in Miami, he served as 
a batboy for the minor league Miami Orioles baseball team. That team featured 
Dodgers John Shelby and Eddie Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"I was excited when Tommy Lasorda called me up this morning and told me he 
wanted me to join the team as soon as possible," Harris told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He will join Daniels here tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get out of Cincinnati in time, but I can't wait to get to L.A. Me 
and Kal are going to supply offense no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
The fourth player in the deal, Mariano Duncan, said he felt just like Leary. He 
said he was glad to be getting a chance to start. For the next three weeks, he 
will replaced the injured Red shortstop Barry Larkin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a business, I'm not the first one who has been traded," Duncan said. "I'm 
only 26, I can still play. I'm going to be in the lineup tomorrow and that 
makes me happy. " 
</P>
<P>
Duncan was the team's opening day second baseman in 1985, and opening day 
shortstop in 1986 and 1987. But last season, after a spring-training fallout 
with Lasorda in which he called Lasorda "a liar," he fell from grace. He sent 
the year at triple-A Albuquerque, and wasn't among the busloads of youngsters 
recalled in September. Last spring he redeemed himself with good play and 
attitude and has been on the Dodger bench since. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of redeeming, Leary will want to chat with Red Manager Pete Rose upon 
his arrival in Cincinnati. A couple of weeks ago, when a strictly 
Leary-for-Daniels deal died, Rose said he was not interested in Leary because 
Leary had a sore arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked the Reds scouting director who I spoke to on the phone today about 
that," Leary said. "He said it should haven't have been taken at face value, 
more or less, that there may have been other motives behind what Pete said. So 
really I don't know what to think about that. 
</P>
<P>
"I did talk to Pete, and he is really excited. That's all I have to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Leary was sent to the bullpen after the All-Star break, after winning just once 
in his previous five starts. During that stretch he had allowed 16 runs in 31 
innings for a 4.65 ERA. In his first bullpen appearance and final appearance as 
a Dodger on Monday night, he showed it. In the eighth inning of a 3-all tie 
with the Chicago Cubs, he walked the bases loaded and then walked in 
.237-hitting Curtis Wilkerson with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward the usually affable Leary walked away from reporters, saying, "I 
don't have anything to say." 
</P>
<P>
He should be remembered for more than that. Acquired in the winter of 1986 from 
Milwaukee with pitcher Tim Crews for first baseman Greg Brock, he struggled in 
1987 by going 3-11 with a 4.76 ERA. But then he spent the winter of 1987 going 
9-0 for Tijuana in the Mexican league in what started baseball's biggest 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer he won 14 more games than in the previous year, going 17-11 with a 
2.91 ERA and winning comeback-player-of-the-year honors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult going to the bullpen in the middle of this year," Leary said. 
"I feel I've pitched impeccably -- maybe they just gave up on me. Yes, maybe 
I'm a little bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes maybe I think it's better that I get out of here. I don't understand 
some of the moves." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said he was feeling the same way about Cincinnati, noting that he would 
miss "nothing," about the city. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a .294-hitting season, it has been a lousy year for him from the 
start. On May 15, a sore right knee forced him on the 21-day disabled list. He 
underwent arthroscopic surgery on the knee on May 16. He returned to the lineup 
on June 21, sprained his right ankle sliding into second base, missed eight 
starts, and then has been in the lineup since June 30. 
</P>
<P>
But as he has struggled both at the plate and in left field, where he wasn't a 
Gold Glove candidate even when injury-free, the fans didn't make him feel 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been booing me since I came off the disabled list, they just think 
that coming off the DL, you are supposed to pick up the city of Cincinnati and 
carry it around on your shoulders," Daniels said. "I'm back, but I just had 
knee surgery. I'm human. That's why I don't trust too many people. The less 
people know about you, the less than can say about you." 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who once predicted that Daniels would win batting titles, now says less 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I watched him the last couple of months against left-handers, the 
most I've started to doubt," Rose said.

BLYLEVEN DELIVERS A 1-0 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>
<P>
TORONTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Closing out an ill-fated trip of disputed home runs, managerial ejections and 
last-moment defeats, the Angels finally had the right man at the right place at 
the right time Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The man was Bert Blyleven. 
</P>
<P>
The place was the pitching mound at the SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
The time was the tail end of a five-game Angel losing streak, with the Angel 
offense in the process of managing only one run off Toronto Blue Jay starter 
Jimmy Key. 
</P>
<P>
So Blyleven knew what he had to do. And he did it, pitching the Angels to a 1-0 
victory before a crowd of 48,717, keeping his team percentage points ahead of 
the Oakland Athletics atop the American League West standings. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some special people who play this game who have timing," Angel 
Manager Doug Rader said. "They know how and when to do things. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert's one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven (10-2) responded to Wally Joyner's home run with a five-hitter and the 
57th shutout of his career, moving him past Bob Gibson and Nolan Ryan into a 
tie for 11th place all-time with Pud Galvin. 
</P>
<P>
And Blyleven had a sense of the urgency around his assignment when he accepted 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd lost five or six games in a row, so I knew I had to go out and bear 
down," Blyleven said. "I knew I was going to win tonight. I had that feeling 
tonight. All I wanted was a run." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, it would've been nice to have four or five," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That type of run production wasn't forthcoming against Key, whose record 
dropped to 7-10 despite his five-hitter. Other than Joyner, only two Angels 
reached second base. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner's homer to right field came in the sixth inning. It was his fourth home 
run of the season, but his second in three days. 
</P>
<P>
Could the old power stroke of '86 and '87 be making a belated comeback? 
</P>
<P>
"Dunno," Joyner said. "I can't answer that. . . . If you ask Jimmy Key, I'm 
sure he'll tell you it was a mistake pitch. I was as surprised as he was." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven limited Toronto to five singles, and only one Blue Jay reached second 
base. That was Tom Lawless in the eighth inning, who pinch-ran after Rance 
Mulliniks singled and stole second. 
</P>
<P>
But Blyleven retired Manny Lee on strikes, stranding Lawless. 
</P>
<P>
The only real scare Blyleven encountered was provided by George Bell with one 
out in the bottom of the ninth. Bell sent Angel right fielder Claudell 
Washington to the warning track for his drive. 
</P>
<P>
Fred McGriff then struck out and the Angel losing streak was over. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the difference in this game," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert throws one breaking ball to (Bell) with just enough topspin so it doesn't 
go out of the park. Key throws a similar pitch to Wally, but just a little 
higher, and it goes out. 
</P>
<P>
"A whole game is decided by the elevation of two breaking balls. Fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had their chances to make the night easier on Blyleven. 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, on Washington's first at-bat since leaving the disabled 
list earlier in the day, the Blue Jays made two errors. First, left fielder 
Bell dropped a pop foul to extend the at-bat. First baseman McGriff followed by 
botching Washington's eventual grounder near the foul line, allowing Washington 
to reach first. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't remain there long. While pitching to the next batter, Dick Schofield, 
Key whirled and picked Washington off first base. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, Brian Downing lined a one-out single, only to wind up as 
the first out of Chili Davis' 20th double-play grounder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, Washington singled and was bunted to second -- but was 
stranded there when as Joyner popped out and Tony Armas flied out. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in the fifth inning, the Angels got back-to-back singles by Lance 
Parrish and Glenn Hoffman. But they put them together with two out. Kent 
Anderson, the Angels' No. 9 hitter, ended the threat by flying out to right. 
</P>
<P>
So, it was left to a fly ball by Joyner one inning later for the Angels to 
salvage the victory, along with a 2-5 trip. 
</P>
<P>
"Aesthetically, it was beautiful," Rader said of the victory. "I'm sure (the 
Blue Jays) are a proud of the effort Jimmy Key gave them, but to win this one 
was more meaningful for us." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
To make room for Claudell Washington's return from the disabled list, the 
Angels sent a .500 hitter to the minor leagues Tuesday. Yes, Max Venable is 
Edmonton bound, despite going 10 for 20 with two RBIs in eight games with the 
Angels. One of those, the now infamous Mike Devereaux game, was a four-hit game 
for Venable, his first as a major leaguer. "It wasn't my decision," Venable 
said. "But I knew it was coming. Doug (Rader) told me in Baltimore. And that, 
actually, took a little pressure off me. I knew Claudell would be coming back, 
so I decided to have a little fun and try to make the team." And, in the 
process, make a lasting impression. "Our roster maneuverability is very limited 
right now," Rader said. "To re-instate Claudell, we really had no other choice. 
But the bottom line is that I'm very happy for Max. This places him in a very 
favorable position in the future." 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons the Angels decided to demote Venable and not a pitcher, 
Rader said, was the uncertain status of starter Kirk McCaskill, who left the 
team Saturday to return home for medical testing. McCaskill was diagnosed as 
having an irritation of the joint in his right elbow and will be held out of 
his next start, scheduled for Thursday. "He's getting better," Rader said. "In 
fact, he probably could've made his start on Thursday. But under advisement of 
our doctors, we'll hold him out once and he'll definitely come back the 10th 
day." So, until McCaskill returns, Rader will be working, in essence, with a 
10-man pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four hours after the fact, Devon White's 10-game hitting streak was 
reduced to nine and ended. In the second game of Monday's doubleheader, White 
was credited with a hit when his sharp grounder deflected off third baseman 
Kelly Gruber's glove into the reach of shortstop Tony Fernandez, who threw home 
to retire Johnny Ray, breaking from third base. White was given a hit because, 
in the opinion of the official scorer, he would have beaten the throw to first 
if Fernandez had instead directed the ball there. But before Tuesday's game, it 
was announced that the scorer had reversed his decision, which meant White 
wound up with a fielder's choice and the opportunity to begin a new streak.

Alan Eagleson, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., has postponed a 
union meeting that was scheduled to review measures that would diminish his 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Player representatives from the 21 clubs were supposed to meet in Toronto next 
Monday and Tuesday to ratify measures adopted after Eagleson survived a 
no-confidence vote last month. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson said he canceled the meeting because an audit, which was requested 
after Eagleson acknowledged using money belonging to the association for loans 
to friends, isn't ready.

Bob Probert, who gained prominence as a right winger with the Detroit Red Wings 
of the National Hockey League despite alcohol and drug problems, pleaded guilty 
to importing cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors noted that the half-ounce of cocaine, which Probert brought 
into the United States from Canada on March 2, was for his personal use. He is 
expected to be given a light prison term at his Sept. 26 sentencing. The 
conviction carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Probert led the league with 398 penalty minutes in 1987-88, a Red Wing record. 
</P>
<P>
Days after his arrest, he was banned from the NHL.

NEWSWIRE: EX-HOYA PLAYER ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Turner, a former Georgetown University basketball forward, has been 
arrested on charges of possession of crack cocaine with the intent to 
distribute. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, along with four others, was arrested Monday at a recreation center in 
Glenarden, Md., a Washington suburb, according to Maryland National Capital 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe Turner and his associates were planning to sell 51 
grams of crack cocaine. Turner posted $30,000 bail and was released. If 
convicted, he could face a 10-year prison sentence, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's scholarship was not renewed by Georgetown, after Coach John Thompson 
told a national television audience that he had learned Turner and freshman 
Alonzo Mourning had been seen in the company of Rayful Edmond III, an alleged 
drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turner, who asked Georgetown University to review the nonrenewal of 
his basketball scholarship, had been playing under a pseudonym in a non-NCAA 
sanctioned summer league, his attorney confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure everyone knows it's John Turner," attorney Sheila Albright told the 
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Albright said she had been told of Turner's participation in the National 
Basketball Assn. Say-No-To-Drugs Pro-Am League by Mary Robinson, Turner's 
grandmother and legal guardian. 
</P>
<P>
The league is not among the four Washington area summer leagues approved by the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn., according to the NCAA's legislative 
services office. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA rules state that any student-athlete who participates in a nonsanctioned 
summer basketball league is ineligible for any further NCAA Division I or 
Division II play. But an NCAA official told the Post that, under normal 
circumstances, someone in violation of the rule would lose one game of 
regular-season eligibility for every nonsanctioned summer league game played. 
</P>
<P>
Turner is not enrolled at any college.

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
SWIMMERS POST MANY BESTS, BUT NO RECORDS

<P>
Optimists that they are, organizers of the 1989 U.S. Olympic Festival chose to 
begin the 13-days' worth of competition with a song of local note. 
</P>
<P>
"Ooooooook-lahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down the plain...," blared the 
music from tiny speakers at the Oklahoma City Community College pool, venue for 
the swimming events Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, well, the Festival was short of both wind and expected records on its 
first day. Turns out that the muggy heat (it reached the low 90s at poolside) 
and the occasional delays that happen during these meets sapped many a swimmer 
of energy. The result: lots of personal bests, but no Festival records. 
</P>
<P>
As meek breezes nudged the assorted banners, 104 of the country's lesser known 
swimmers, all 18 or under, assembled for the first day of actual Festival 
competition. They were treated to a brand new pool with 81-degree water 
temperatures (a tad too warm for competition) and an enthusiastic audience. 
</P>
<P>
The official opening ceremony is scheduled for Friday, but since the majority 
of these swimmers will travel to Los Angeles later this month for the national 
championships, an early start was granted. The remainder of the 37-sport 
competition begins in earnest Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Fitingly enough, an Oklahoman -- Trip Zedlitz of Oklahoma City -- won the 
Festival's first event, the 200-meter individual medley. By the way, his real 
name is Alfred Charles Zedlitz. Zedlitz later finished second in the 200-meter 
backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
The only multiple winner was Paige Wilson of Athens, Ga., who won both the 
200-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
JOHNSON, FERNANDEZ CARRY THE METS AGAIN, 9-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Mets spent the winter trying to trade Howard Johnson and Sid 
Fernandez. If they had succeeded, they might be battling to stay out of last 
place in the National League East instead of trying to win the division. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a third baseman who can play shortstop, and Fernandez, a pitcher who 
before this season had not quite lived up to expectations, are the bright spots 
of a difficult season for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have had their share of injuries, but the players who were expected to 
be prominent -- rookie infielder Gregg Jefferies, right fielder Darryl 
Strawberry, left fielder Kevin McReynolds and pitchers David Cone and Ron 
Darling -- haven't had spectacular seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Fernandez, meanwhile, have carried the team. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Fernandez again provided the lift Tuesday night when the Mets beat 
the Houston Astros, 9-0, ending a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson hit his 25th home run of the season and singled and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, a 3-2 loser despite a 16-strikeout performance in his previous 
outing, held the Astros to three singles in seven innings and improved to 8-3. 
</P>
<P>
In his last six starts, Fernandez, a hard-throwing left-hander who started in 
the Dodger organization, has an earned-run average of 1.43. He also has 22 
strikeouts in his last 15 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who underwent surgery on his right shoulder during the off-season, 
didn't swing a bat until February, but broke into the lineup opening day and 
has been there ever since. He is second to San Francisco's Kevin Mitchell in 
home runs and third in runs batted in with 61. 
</P>
<P>
When he was voted the league's starting third baseman in the All-Star game last 
week, Johnson figured he deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the best third baseman in the league," he said. Since then, the Mets have 
been forced to move him to short. At the time he was probably right. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been kind of a whirlwind year for me," he said. "In the winter I was 
traded to four or five teams. Then in the spring, I had to prove I could throw. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a banner year already. Recently, I signed a new contract and then I 
opened at third base in the All-Star game. I never would have believed it last 
winter." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Hernandez, who has missed much of the season because of a broken knee, 
left the game with a bruised knee. The injury was not believed to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 7, St. Louis 3 -- Catcher Kirt Manwaring hit a two-out, 
bases-loaded triple in the first inning and the Giants went on to win for the 
22nd time in their last 27 games at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' fourth victory in a row increased their lead in the West to 3 1/2 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero homered for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 17, Pittsburgh 4 -- Chris James hit his second grand slam of the 
season as the Padres tied a club record for runs in this game at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
James had four of the Padres' season-high total of 22 hits and drove in five 
runs. James hit his grand slam and Jack Clark homered during the Padres' 
eight-run eighth inning. It was Clark's first homer since June 19. 
</P>
<P>
James came to the Padres in mid-June in the deal that sent Randy Ready and John 
Kruk to the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, always a slow starter, has hit safely in 13 consecutive games. He had 
his first three-hit game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 7, Montreal 6 -- Winds were so strong in Montreal that the Expos were 
unable to close the retractable roof of their stadium and the start of the game 
was delayed almost two hours. 
</P>
<P>
And when the Expos built a 6-0 lead for Dennis Martinez, who had won nine in a 
row, it didn't seem to matter. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves' Lonnie Smith singled in a run to get the Braves going in the sixth 
as they scored three. Then, in the seventh, Smith capped a four-run rally with 
a two-run single to put the Braves in front to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 6, Cincinnati 5 -- The Reds' Danny Jackson, the second-best 
pitcher in the league last season behind the Dodgers' Orel Hershiser, is 6-10. 
Last season, his first with the Reds, he was 23-8. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up four runs in the first inning, Jackson settled down and retired 
12 in a row before Randy Ready tagged a slider for his fourth home run of the 
season in the eighth inning at Cincinnati to break a 5-5 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds have lost eight of their last nine games and 24 of their last 34. They 
have fallen into fourth place behind San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson went nine innings for the first time in 19 tries, but that seemed to be 
little consolation. When asked about his performance, he answered with 
profanities. DAN HAFNER

SILVERWOOD LAKE IS HOME FOR THE PREDATOR BASS -- AND THEIR ANGLING NEMESIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you visit Silverwood Lake, nestled in the San Bernardino Mountains near 
Highway 138, chances are you will run into Greg Silks. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old from Altadena can be found fishing the shores of the reservoir, 
highest in the California Aqueduct system, at dawn or dusk, midday or midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Campers might get a glimpse of him climbing down from the highway to fish the 
early hours of the night. 
</P>
<P>
"The bite's been turning on at 8 p.m. and lasting till about 10," Silks told 
one recent visitor. "Then it turns off till about 1 (a.m.) and lasts till about 
3. I like to doze in between." 
</P>
<P>
The bite he talks of is that of the striped bass, the lake's most challenging 
and predatorial inhabitant, and the only species of fish Silks cares about. 
</P>
<P>
"He's quite good," concession manager Jeannie Bryant says of Silks' angling 
skills. "As good or better than anyone else here." 
</P>
<P>
When someone wants to catch a striper, Bryant steers them to Silks. One such 
person is the Lakers' Orlando Woolridge, an avid fisherman and regular visitor 
here. But one who had yet to catch a striper. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been fishing a couple of times for stripers," Woolridge said while 
casting lures alongside Silks. "I come here a lot and it was just a matter of 
time until we got together. We've been at the lake all day . . . we hit it off 
right off the bat." 
</P>
<P>
And why not. Silks loves to talk stripers. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they'll usually come in like a wolf-pack," Silks said. "And when they 
attack, oh, man, they explode!" 
</P>
<P>
Silks, who manufactures fishing tackle, has been fishing this reservoir 
regularly for the last 12 years. He has caught more than his share of stripers, 
including the lake-record 41-pounder he had mounted. 
</P>
<P>
"It fought hard," he said. "It took the better part of 15 to 20 minutes (to 
catch). I caught one that was about 22 pounds, though, and I swore that fish 
was 50 pounds. It was a little spark, a real spitfire. In general, it seems the 
younger fish tug a lot harder than the bigger ones." 
</P>
<P>
Silks tells of the woman who, a few years back, went screaming for help after 
watching a hungry striper chase down a trout. 
</P>
<P>
"She was down in Miller (Canyon) with a baby in the sun on a sand bar, and here 
comes a big striper chasing a trout right in to the beach . . . Wwwrrrr," Silks 
said. "It comes charging in right after her. She yells wolf and runs and gets 
the ranger and says the fish tried to get her child." 
</P>
<P>
Stripers don't come easy, not even for Silks. 
</P>
<P>
"The average angler that's tryin' to catch one . . . one out of 10 trips he'll 
connect," he said. Asked how many fishermen actually know what they're doing 
when fishing for this foraging bass, Silks will reply, "Probably . . . 12." 
</P>
<P>
But if its tips you want, then Silks is the person to see. Catch one of his 
seminars. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, action's the attraction, color's the reaction," he says. "Action's 
the attraction, so the action is going to govern how fast and how slow you want 
your lures to go." 
</P>
<P>
The color of the lure is what the fish reacts to. If one color doesn't produce, 
another should be tried. If the action isn't working, that, too, should be 
modified. 
</P>
<P>
"The lighter it is, the faster you go. The darker it is, the slower you go," he 
said. "That's the general rule of thumb." 
</P>
<P>
The best time for stripers, most fishermen agree, is after the Department of 
Fish and Game dumps its biweekly load of trout into the reservoir to sustain a 
trout fishery. Freshly planted trout -- though it is illegal to use them as 
bait -- are regarded as one of the striper's favorite foods. 
</P>
<P>
But, says DFG biologist Chuck Marshall, the striper "is a very efficient 
predator that will eat just about anything." 
</P>
<P>
Any other factors? 
</P>
<P>
"I like to watch storm systems, high pressure . . . things like that," Silks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The best is during low barometric pressure, the lowest you can find. Like when 
we (he and his fishing partner) caught those 219 pounds (nine fish) in March, 
the barometric pressure was 29.76." 
</P>
<P>
On fishing during a high pressure: "You can if they plant trout . . other than 
that it's tough. There's a big ledge out there and they sit in about 65 feet of 
water right on that ledge. And when they want to feed it'll be early in the 
morning and late in the evening, and that's it. That's all they're gonna eat." 
</P>
<P>
On the effect of the moon: "I like to fish the new moon or when it's dark. Or, 
if you're gonna fish the full moon, fish in the shadows, anywhere there are 
shadows. Remember, you're fishing for a predator fish, and predators attack 
from the shadows -- they like to sit in shadows and wait for fish to swim by, 
and attack from there." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, not a single fish had been caught, though many were seen swirling 
about the surface in pursuit of trout. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge, who had to be on the road at 4 a.m. the next day to catch his 
chartered sportfisher in San Diego, was in a hurry to get home to Pacific 
Palisades. He would have to wait another day to catch his striper. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge will be back, however, and he will look up Silks because "he's the 
man," Woolridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Silks' explanation for the slow bite: "That's fishing . . . Nope, that's 
Silverwood." 
</P>
<P>
Silverwood Lake, located 85 miles east of Los Angeles and 30 miles north of San 
Bernardino, where the high Mojave Desert blends into the San Bernardino 
Mountains, was formerly known for its trophy trout fishery. 
</P>
<P>
But that all changed when striped bass began filtering through the California 
Aqueduct in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Silverwood became one of two striper fisheries in the Southern California 
portion of the system. The other is Pyramid Lake in Los Angeles County. Pyramid 
is located on the west branch of the aqueduct, Silverwood on the east. 
</P>
<P>
Silks says that what sets the two reservoirs apart is the abundance of food in 
Silverwood, which makes fishing tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two different kinds of shrimp, shad, trout, all kinds of blackfish 
that come in through the Delta," he said. "If they want to eat largemouth 
(bass), largemouth are out there . . . anything. I've never found a largemouth 
in the belly of a striper, but they're a predator and if one happens to be 
swimming by, why not eat it it? It's natures way." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, Silverwood, as does Pyramid, offers more than striped bass 
to fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
A healthy trout fishery still exists, but only because of the DFG's stocking 
program, deemed necessary to sustain any trout population at all. A cold-water 
species, the trout at Silverwood often choose to remain along the banks, where 
the water is about 74 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"If it moves into deep water it won't last long," said chief ranger Steve 
Hansen of the Department of Parks and Recreation, which manages the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from striped bass and trout, Silverwood has been rated as one of the 
state's top crappie fisheries and also has healthy populations of largemouth 
bass, catfish and bluegill. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said that about 60% of the lake's visitors are fishermen, the rest being 
water skiers, bikers -- there are several miles of paved trails -- and campers 
who utilize the park's 135 developed campsites. 
</P>
<P>
"During the month of June alone we had 82,000 visitors," he said. Many of whom 
have probably crossed paths with striper fisherman Greg Silks.

EUROPE DEVELOPS MANIA FOR CORPORATE MERGERS

It wasn't long ago that "Europeans thought mergers were brash, American and in 
bad taste, like stretch limousines or hamburgers," John M. Hennessy, vice 
chairman of CS First Boston, recalled at a London conference on mergers and 
acquisitions late last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The American raiders and greenmailers of the late 1970s and early 1980s were 
as shocking to the Europeans as streakers at a cricket match," Hennessy said. 
But, he added, times are changing. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, the First Boston executive's remarks look like a stage cue for 
Sir James Goldsmith, the flamboyant Anglo-French takeover specialist whose 
Yankee-like $21.5-billion bid for Britain's BAT Industries last week put Europe 
squarely in mergerdom's major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The BAT bid, which still faces many financial, legal and political hurdles, was 
by far Britain's biggest takeover offer ever -- four times larger than 
conglomerate Hanson PLC's well-publicized bid for Consolidated Gold Fields. 
Worldwide, it is outranked only by last year's record $25-billion purchase of 
RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., a New York leveraged 
buyout firm. 
</P>
<P>
But while it is a landmark in its own right, Goldsmith's highly leveraged grab 
for the British insurance, retailing and tobacco conglomerate is only part of a 
broader overseas merger and acquisition boom that has already transformed 
Britain's business climate and that is now having a growing impact on 
continental Europe and even Asia as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reshaping the Landscape 
</P>
<P>
"Since the mid-1980s, large tracts of the (European) industrial landscape have 
been reshaped by mergers and acquisitions, primarily within countries, but 
increasingly across European borders," wrote Guy de Jonquieres, international 
business editor, in a recent review for London's Financial Times. 
</P>
<P>
De Jonquieres and other experts caution that because of the difficulty of 
collecting worldwide statistics and the fact that few organizations until 
recently even tried very hard to gather them, available figures are more a 
guide than a definitive yardstick. 
</P>
<P>
These figures show that the freewheeling Britain of Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher is still the capital of Europe's merger trend by a wide margin. 
However, flush with cash and credit and facing the challenge of an open, 
unified European market in 1992, companies in France, West Germany, Spain and 
Italy are also increasingly busy at the corporate mating game. 
</P>
<P>
The BAT deal involves the takeover of one British firm by another, but growth 
is fastest, according to the experts, in cross-border activity. Based on large 
transactions valued at $100 million or more, the international mergers and 
acquisitions market has nearly trebled in just the last two years, according to 
Hennessy. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has long been the favored shopping ground for European firms 
on the prowl, but lately there are signs of a continental shift, particularly 
among smaller deal-makers. 
</P>
<P>
British firms made more acquisitions in mainland Europe than in the United 
States for the first time in the first half of 1989, according to Acquisitions 
Monthly, a British publication. Said editor Philip Healey: "With several 
European countries now reviewing both their takeover policies and corporate 
defense mechanisms, the public sectors in countries such as France and Holland 
may yet become more active, paving the way to larger deals on the Continent." 
</P>
<P>
And Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG), a big international accounting and 
management consulting firm, said in the latest edition of its quarterly "Deal 
Watch" report: "While EC companies continue to look to North America for their 
largest acquisitions, they have reduced greatly the number of their 
middle-market purchases (worth $100 million or less) in North America, 
concentrating instead on buying other European companies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Middle-Market Mergers 
</P>
<P>
While the mega-deals valued at $1 billion and up get most of the publicity, 
most global acquisitions are in the smaller, middle-market category. Only about 
one such deal in five is worth more than $100 million, and six out of 10 are 
worth less than $25 million, according to KPMG. 
</P>
<P>
Another trend: growing Japanese involvement in the European merger and 
acquisitions market. 
</P>
<P>
"Although Japanese firms have plowed plenty of money into Europe to grow their 
own businesses from scratch, they have largely steered clear of the 
acquisitions game -- until now," wrote Britain's respected Economist magazine 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Yokohama has bid $148 million for Guinness Mahon, a small British 
merchant bank; soap maker Kao has put up $133 million for a 75% stake in a West 
German producer of hair care products, and just last Thursday, it was announced 
that Honda would buy 20% of Britain's Rover Group for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the newly industrialized Pacific Rim countries are also entering the 
acquisition scene but, like Japan, they shy away from Goldsmith-style corporate 
raids. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reasons for this restraint are both cultural and pragmatic," 
according to a special Deal Watch report. "Japanese firms place great store in 
maintaining good relationships with existing management. With trade issues 
assuming ever greater political importance, the Japanese are careful not to 
come across as 'bullies' in their trade partners' back yards. History also 
shows that friendly takeovers are the ones most likely to succeed in the long 
term." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy Differences 
</P>
<P>
There remain significant differences in government policy toward mergers and 
acquisitions in different European nations. 
</P>
<P>
British firms are by far the most active within Europe, both as transnational 
buyers and sellers, playing a role in about two-thirds of all such deals 
involving a European Community partner. French firms, in second place, are 
involved in about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
While much smaller, Spain has taken one of the continent's most positive 
stances toward foreign direct investment and has attracted $20 billion worth in 
the last three years as a result. Commented First Boston's Hennessy: "Raiders 
and merger kings, much denounced even in today's U.S.A., are admired there as 
the rightful heirs of the vanished conquistadors." 
</P>
<P>
In West Germany, where the heavy involvement of banks and insurance companies 
in corporate ownership structure has long discouraged mergers and acquisitions, 
a recent change in tax law has injected new life. As of Jan. 1, 1990, the 
capital gains tax on the sale of companies jumps from 28% to 53%, and smaller, 
privately held firms, particularly, are eager to beat the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
According to Klaus Peter Sauer, managing partner of KPMG's Frankfurt affiliate, 
the number of domestic merger and acquisition deals within West Germany is 
expected to hit about 4,200 this year, up from 1,543 in 1987. He predicts that 
foreign firms will scoop up another 600 West German companies, more than double 
the 1987 pace. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum from open-door Britain are some of Europe's 
smaller nations. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's companies, according to Hennessy, "are almost as impregnable as 
its mountains." And firms in both Belgium and the Netherlands can, if 
threatened by a hostile takeover, issue extra shares to friendly associates or 
impose limits on the voting powers of some share holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Even the freest of the free-wheelers have some concerns about Europe's merger 
mania. 
</P>
<P>
"The wave of mergers and acquisitions sweeping across large sections of 
European industry is all to the good as long as it produces more efficient and 
dynamic business groupings," the Financial Times said this spring in an 
editorial. "However, the increasingly feverish psychological climate in which 
many deals are being made gives rise to two distinct concerns to which 
shareholders and policy-makers need to be alert. 
</P>
<P>
"One is that, in the stampede to prepare for the single market, companies will 
overreach themselves, allowing opportunism or the pursuit of size for its own 
sake to prevail over sound business logic," the newspaper said. "The other is 
that mergers will result in excessive concentration and cartelization." 
</P>
<P>
The European Commission in Brussels would like to have more power to rule on 
cross-border mergers involving EC firms. "We want to go toward a more 
interventionist system," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But some governments, notably that of Britain, are not enthusiastic for 
political as well as practical reasons. And money men like Hennessy fear that, 
left to the bureaucrats, 1992 will become a "Frankenstein that will regulate, 
not liberate, the European economy." The First Boston executive characterized 
cross-border takeovers as "one of the litmus tests" of how serious Europeans 
are about opening their markets. 
</P>
<P>
The BAT bid by Goldsmith and his partners -- financier Jacob Rothschild and 
Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer -- will be a test even for Britain. "An 
important element is how the government is going to react," said Acquisitions 
Monthly editor Healey. "Is it good for the UK industry? What benefits will come 
out of it besides making three rich men richer?" 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Office of Fair Trading and possibly its Monopolies and Mergers 
Commission are expected to study the BAT deal on public interest grounds. A key 
question will no doubt be the impact on British employment of Goldsmith's 
announced plan to sell off everything but BAT's core tobacco interests. 
</P>
<P>
For all its commitment to free markets, the Thatcher government last spring 
blocked the acquisition of brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle PLC by Australia's 
Elders IXL. 
</P>
<P>
Also, industrialists and money men are concerned about the structure of 
Goldsmith's offer, which many see as heralding the advent of the same "junk 
financing" that has come under a cloud in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Scottish bankers earlier this year, Bank of England Governor Robin 
Leigh-Pemberton said the authorities would be keeping an eye on all highly 
leveraged deals. "I would be concerned if the development of the leveraged 
buyout market here were to result in a profusion of unsuccessful financial 
arrangements," he commented. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens to the BAT bid, however, it is unlikely to slow down the 
broader overseas mergers and acquisitions boom.

'EVERYONE WANTS TO BE A MEGA-CARRIER'; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES LOOK FOR PARTNERS IN EUROPE FOR EXPANSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. airlines are joining forces with well-heeled airlines in Europe to extend 
their reach around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
The corporate parents of expansion-minded Continental Airlines, Northwest 
Airlines and Delta Air Lines have joined forces in recent weeks with smaller, 
cash-rich European airlines anxious for more American customers. The trend is 
expected to continue as airlines on both continents look for ways to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, everyone wants to be a mega-carrier," said Frank Spencer, professor 
emeritus at Northwestern University's Transportation Center, in an interview. 
"The fancy word is global." 
</P>
<P>
The new transatlantic alliances differ from the frequent-flier partnerships 
familiar to American air travelers. The new arrangements are more complex 
because European airlines are buying ownership stakes in U.S. air carriers, and 
in some cases, becoming increasingly involved in their management. The chairman 
of Scandinavian Airline Systems now sits on the board of Texas Air Corp., the 
parent of Continental and Eastern Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines say the new alliances provide significant benefits. The U.S. 
airlines, frequently rumored to be takeover targets, get a friendly investor 
and, in some cases, European know-how. For example, SAS, a premium airline, is 
helping to improve the poor image of its U.S. partner by teaching Continental's 
flight crews good customer service. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for their money and assistance, European airlines get a valuable 
foothold in the all-important U.S. travel market, now all but closed to them. 
"The bottom-line objective is to feed passengers to each other," said Thomas 
McKenna, Swissair's newly appointed manager of airline cooperation, whose sole 
task is to nurture his employer's coveted relationship with Delta. 
</P>
<P>
Because the partnerships between U.S. and European airlines are so new, the 
impact on air travelers is not yet clear. John R. Meyer, a Harvard University 
aviation expert, said consumers should benefit, at least for now. He said the 
relationships should improve connections with overseas flights and support 
domestic competition, since investments from rich foreign carriers should help 
weak U.S. airlines survive. 
</P>
<P>
But some experts warn that consumers may suffer as more airlines form 
partnerships, especially if two strong air carriers team up. The trend "over 
time will tend to support higher fares because competition will be reduced," 
said Paul Turk, an airline industry consultant with Avmark Inc. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in U.S. airlines has raised protectionist concerns. Right 
now, federal rules prohibit foreigners from owning more than one-quarter of a 
U.S. airline, making takeovers by foreign carriers impossible. But the new 
alliances are viewed as a first step toward breaking down the government 
barriers and opening the U.S. travel market to foreign airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation consultant Morton Beyer, president of Avmark, said as barriers are 
lowered, the U.S airline industry could one day go the way of the American 
maritime industry, with airlines flying under the flags of Panama, Liberia or 
Greece. 
</P>
<P>
"The American airline market is the plum of the world, and if we don't watch 
it, foreign investors are going to be eating our lunch," said Sen. Wendell H. 
Ford (D-Ky.). Ford, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation 
Committee's aviation subcommittee, has sponsored legislation with Sen. John 
McCain (R-Ariz.) that would give the Transportation Department greater 
authority to reject airline deals involving foreign investors. European 
airlines are not alone in making U.S. airline investments. An Australian 
airline and a Japanese airline own stakes in two U.S. air carriers, but those 
relationships have produced few cooperative ventures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strictly an Investment 
</P>
<P>
Ansett Airlines of Australia has a 20% stake in America West Airlines and 
leases 10 airliners to the Phoenix-based air carrier. Since both airlines 
operate only within their own countries, there is no opportunity to coordinate 
flights. America West says it might work more closely with Ansett if it gets 
federal permission to fly to Australia, but that is not considered likely. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a Japan Air Lines hotel subsidiary controls 20% of troubled Hawaiian 
Airlines, but a JAL spokesman said its holdings are strictly an investment. 
"They needed capital, and we operate hotels in the region. We had an interest 
in helping them," JAL spokesman Morris Simoncelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural gap between the United States and Asia is expected to limit the 
number of transpacific relationships, at least for now. But many aviation 
experts think that similar cultures and the pressures of deregulation in Europe 
will lead to more alliances between airlines on both sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Access to the giant U.S. market is becoming increasingly important for European 
airlines, as the European Community prepares to deregulate the marketplace in 
1992. When the economic barriers now separating the EC's nine member-nations 
are dropped, small airlines there will lose their protected home markets. 
</P>
<P>
By developing a strong U.S. business, smaller European airlines -- such as SAS, 
Swissair and KLM Royal Dutch Airways -- hope to better withstand competitive 
assaults in their home countries from large European airlines, such as British 
Airways or Lufthansa. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign airlines need American partners to gain access to the U.S. market 
because federal rules greatly restrict their ability to do business here. 
Foreign airlines are permitted to fly passengers out of this country but are 
prohibited from hauling passengers between U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternative for Carriers 
</P>
<P>
By closely matching flight schedules, European airlines hope that their 
American partners will collect Europe-bound travelers for them. SAS, for 
example, has moved its U.S. gateway from New York's John F. Kennedy 
International Airport to Newark International Airport in New Jersey, an 
important hub for Continental. If the agreement works as SAS hopes, Continental 
will pick up Scandinavia-bound passengers from around the United States and 
deliver them to SAS in Newark. 
</P>
<P>
"Since they (foreign airlines) can't enter the market directly, an alternative 
is for them to buy a piece of an American airline," said Alfred E. Kahn, 
chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1977-78 and now a professor of 
political economy at Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn favors alliances that tend to support small or weak air carriers. He says 
the SAS investment in Texas Air, for example, should help that debt-laden 
company remain competitive. Similarly, he approves Delta's partnership because 
it helps support Swissair -- "a smaller carrier whose competitive ability to 
survive in the long run isn't clear." 
</P>
<P>
However, Kahn called "troublesome" possible alliances between two larger 
airlines with overlapping markets, such as United Airlines and British Airways. 
Those two air carriers have a marketing partnership but no direct financial 
involvement in each other. A closer relationship between the two, Kahn said, 
"would eliminate competition." 
</P>
<P>
The future of foreign investment is likely to be shaped by the government's 
decision on the proposed transaction between KLM and NWA Inc., the parent of 
Northwest Airlines. KLM is a partner with Los Angeles investor Alfred A. 
Checchi in his winning $4.05-billion bid for NWA. Checchi is borrowing more 
than $3 billion of the total. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Foreign Investor 
</P>
<P>
KLM is putting up $400 million -- 60% of the equity -- to help buy the airline, 
but in order to comply with federal rules, KLM is getting just less than 5% of 
the voting stock. KLM will also hold one seat on NWA's proposed seven-member 
board. 
</P>
<P>
That transaction is complicated by the involvement of another foreign investor, 
the Australian brewing conglomerate Elders IXL. Elders is investing 
significantly less than KLM -- $80 million in equity -- but will receive just 
under 15% of the voting stock. Like KLM, Elders will have one board seat. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department must decide whether the transaction gives foreign 
interests "control" of Northwest Airlines. If it is approved, it will clear the 
way for more similarly structured deals between airlines in the United States 
and Europe, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire industry is watching that case," said consultant Beyer, "the way a 
mongoose watches a cobra." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES' TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCES 
</P>
<P>
Continental - SAS 
</P>
<P>
Scandinavian Airline Systems acquired 9% of stock of Texas Air, Continental's 
parent, and has a seat on its board. Continental and SAS are linking hubs at 
Newark. SAS employees are teaching Continental flight crews good 
customer-service practices. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest - KLM 
</P>
<P>
KLM Royal Dutch Airways is putting up $400 million to help Alfred Checchi buy 
NWA, parent of Northwest. KLM and Northwest expect to work together on 
marketing, scheduling and other activities. KLM will get a seat on NWA's board. 
</P>
<P>
Delta - Swissair 
</P>
<P>
The airlines agreed last week to buy a 5% stake in each other. They are working 
together on design for McDonnell Douglas MD-11s that the airlines ordered 
separately. Trying to coordinate flight schedules to simplify connections on 
international flights. 
</P>
<P>
Other connections: 
</P>
<P>
Ansett Airlines of Australia owns a 20% stake in America West, and leases 10 
airliners to the Phoenix-based carrier. Pan Pacific Hotels, a hotel subsidiary 
of Japan Air Lines, owns 20% of Hawaiian Airlines as an investment.

JAMES FLANIGAN: ENERGY POLICY MOVES INTO ROUGH WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What does it mean that a sudden and major political ruckus over offshore oil 
drilling is being met with an indifferent silence in the oil industry? It's 
like the dog that did not bark in the Sherlock Holmes story "Silver Blaze." 
Just as the dog's silence gave Holmes a clue, the industry's silence says a lot 
about the changing world of oil and energy -- and about the American people 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The political action is noisy as the House of Representatives, reacting to 
recent oil spills in Alaska and on the East Coast, last week passed a bill 
banning drilling or work leading to drilling for at least a year along the 
entire California coast, parts of the East Coast including Florida, and 
stretches of Alaska. The Senate is prepared to do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
That caused the Bush Administration to send up a howl of protest Tuesday in a 
speech by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, who said Congress was "burying its 
head in the sand" and ignoring the dangers of future energy dependency. 
</P>
<P>
But the oil industry has been silent. The stock prices of oil drilling and 
service companies, such as Baker-Hughes, Halliburton, Cameron Iron Works and 
Dresser Industries, haven't declined since the House approved a hold on their 
business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Share of Revenues 
</P>
<P>
Why not? The answer is global. The companies are less dependent on U.S. 
business than they used to be because oil exploration is moving overseas, says 
analyst Fred Z. Mills, of the Texas brokerage firm Lovett, Mitchell, Webb &amp; 
Garrison. U.S. oil companies are drilling in Britain's North Sea, in Asian 
waters off Indonesia and the South China Sea, and off the West Coast of Africa 
-- not to mention the coasts of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, U.S. drilling and service companies now get a growing share 
of revenue from foreign operations. Halliburton, for instance, gets 31% of its 
revenue from abroad, Baker-Hughes gets 45%, Cameron Iron Works 53%, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
So in one sense, all is well. U.S. companies sell services abroad and help 
reduce the trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But the move abroad has its ominous side too. It results first of all from slim 
pickings at home. With the exception of Alaska -- where drilling may be banned 
-- there are few big oil prospects left in a country where the average well now 
produces only 14 barrels a day. The Gulf of Mexico -- not affected by the ban 
-- is maintaining production, but Alaskan production peaked last year and has 
begun a long decline. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects are better overseas -- and countries are encouraging. The British 
government, for example, awards leases to companies that promise to drill the 
most wells. Other nations have similar policies and are attracting drillers. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to encourage work; this country wants to prevent it," remarks Mike 
Bowlin, the Dallas-based president of Atlantic Richfield's international oil 
and gas division -- with an oilman's overstatement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Curious Story 
</P>
<P>
The reality may be that the American people, like spoiled children, don't know 
what they want. The drilling ban, for example, seems cockeyed. Passed in the 
heat of outrage over tanker spills, its effect would be to reduce future U.S. 
oil production, which would lead to more imports, which would mean more tankers 
in U.S. waters. 
</P>
<P>
And the full story is even more curious than that. One big push behind the 
anti-drilling legislation -- which is being proposed by California lawmakers 
Leon Panetta (D-Monterey) and Sen. Pete Wilson -- is that the oil companies 
intended to use small tankers to transport oil from offshore rigs to refinery 
sites. Normally, environmentally safer pipelines would do the job, but the 
coastal counties of Humboldt and Mendocino have already made pipelines 
impossible by prohibiting onshore terminals for them. 
</P>
<P>
So no new oil may be drilled off California -- which remains the nation's No. 2 
energy-consuming state, after Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The irony would be rich, if prospects weren't so troubling. The fact is, U.S. 
dependency on imported oil is about to increase dramatically. The United States 
now uses 17.01 million barrels of oil a day, and imports 6.28 million barrels, 
or 37% of the total. But in 1995, according to the Department of Energy, the 
United States will be importing 9.28 million barrels a day of the 17.82 million 
daily barrels it will then be using -- 52% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
Yet faced with that prospect, the American people -- who are going to need oil 
and who, with good reason, fear the environmental hazard from tankers -- seem 
set to ban domestic drilling. Sherlock Holmes himself would be baffled.

JAPAN FIRM BUYS DANA POINT RESORT FOR $104 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The oceanfront Dana Point Resort has been sold to a Japanese garment industry 
giant for about $104 million in what is one of the largest real estate deals in 
the Southland this year. 
</P>
<P>
The price represents a doubling in the value of the 12-acre property 
overlooking Dana Point Harbor in Orange County, built for $50 million in 1987, 
and demonstrates the torrid appreciation of coastal property. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Thomas Cos., owned by Beverly Hills hoteliers Edward and Thomas Slatkin, 
said the sale to Tokyo Masuiwaya California Corp. of Japan, the investment arm 
of Japan's leading kimono maker, was completed Tuesday. The Slatkins acquired 
the resort in February, 1988, for $65 million from Southmark Pacific Corp. in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The Slatkins, whose family owned the Beverly Hills Hotel for 30 years, said in 
an interview Tuesday that Masuiwaya officials did not discuss plans for the 
resort with them but did retain the existing management. 
</P>
<P>
Masuiwaya officials declined to discuss the deal, according to a spokeswoman at 
Yasuda Bank &amp; Trust in Los Angeles, which represented the Japanese firm in 
the deal. Masuiwaya of California also owns the Cliffs resort, a new property 
near Pismo Beach, and La Jolla's Colonial Inn, an older, 10-room oceanfront 
resort.

<P>
Real estate industry consultants said the price is a record for a single 
property in Orange County by a Japanese buyer and is one of the highest prices 
paid for a hotel in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, according to COMPS Inc., a San Diego research firm, the only Orange 
County real estate deal that approaches the Dana Point Resort sale was the 1988 
acquisition of two Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. office buildings in 
Newport Beach for $83 million by the California State Teachers Retirement 
System. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge appreciation that the Dana Point Resort sale represents, the 
price is not out of line for a coastal resort, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at recent hotel sales in Southern California, like La Costa Resort 
(in San Diego County) that sold for $250 million and Hotel Bel Air for $110 
million, it is in keeping with what is happening," said Jim Burba, a partner in 
the Costa Mesa office of Pannell Kerr Forster, an accounting firm and 
consultant to the hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Prime hotel property in Southern California is selling at very high prices in 
comparison to other parts of the U.S. because this is perceived to be a strong 
economy and a strong market," Burba said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Slatkin said the resort's occupancy rate currently is about 75%, up from 
only 50% last year. A 75% occupancy rate is considered good in the resort 
industry. "We upgraded and repositioned the hotel and refocused it to the 
resort business, and that had a lot to do with the price," Slatkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Slatkin said that the sale doesn't represent an exit from the hotel business by 
the Edward Thomas Cos. "The only thing you can read into this sale is that on a 
highly leveraged acquisition that we put almost no cash into, we got nearly 60% 
appreciation in one year and made an enormous amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
He said he and his brother intend to take the profit from the sale and "buy or 
build a fabulous new hotel or other business in the consumer field."

AT&amp;T Introduces New PCs: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. unveiled 
four personal computers made to AT&amp;T specifications by Intel Corp., which 
is substantially replacing Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. as the company's 
PC supplier. The computers are specially designed to be used in networks and 
can be purchased with software that allows them to perform particular 
networking or communications jobs. They range in price from $2,995 to $22,225. 
The announcement was expected after AT&amp;T's announcement last week of a 
personal computer development agreement with Intel, which is better known for 
selling bare chips, not whole computers.

and Exchange Commission filing. It is the second time since March that Simmons 
has increased his stake in the company. Simmons, who leads an investor group, 
has said his Lockheed shares are for investment purposes only, but his filing 
contains language that indicates he may seek control of the company. Lockheed

Santa Fe to Cut Staff: Santa Fe Railway announced that it is cutting its staff 
by about 450 people, from clerical workers to upper-level management, as part 
of a plan to streamline operations. President Michael R. Haverty said nearly 
all of the reductions would be made through voluntary severance and early 
retirement, "although there will be a limited number of involuntary 
separations." All of the positions being eliminated are non-union jobs.

MCI, US SPRINT POST BIG GAINS IN PROFIT, SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's leading competitors in long-distance 
telecommunications reported major profit gains Tuesday. MCI Communications said 
its second-quarter earnings more than doubled while U S Sprint, which has lost 
money for most of its history, was "solidly in the black" in its first-ever 
billion-dollar quarter. 
</P>
<P>
MCI, the nation's No. 2 long-distance company after AT&amp;T, posted net income 
of $150 million, up 129% from the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 31% 
to $1.59 billion. For the six months, earnings reached $270 million, up 125%, 
on revenue of $3.09 billion, a 32% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, third-ranked Sprint, which became profitable for the first time in 
the last quarter of 1988, continued its rebound. Sprint's operating income 
reached $75.6 million for the first half of the year, contrasted with a 
$222.7-million loss for the first six months of 1988. Without disclosing a 
specific figure, Sprint also said it posted its first quarter with revenue 
exceeding $1 billion in the three months ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
That translated into improved results for Sprint's parent, Kansas City, 
Mo.-based United Telecommunications, which also owns a string of local phone 
companies. United Telecom reported a second-quarter profit of $90.5 million, up 
121%. Revenue increased nearly 19% to $1.85 billion. For the six months, profit 
totaled $166.9 million, up 118%, as revenue increased about 17%, to $3.62 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Near Expectations 
</P>
<P>
"While the market for long-distance services is increasingly competitive, we're 
better equipped to compete on all fronts than ever before," William T. Esrey, 
United Telecom's president and chief executive, told a New York meeting of 
security analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The increases by both MCI and Sprint were close to Wall Street's expectations, 
said Stuart Crane, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co. in New York. But Crane 
warned that AT&amp;T can be expected to compete more vigorously since the 
Federal Communications Commission increased the company's flexibility in 
setting general prices and in tailoring special packages of services for big 
business, effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although he expects both MCI and Sprint to remain profitable, Crane predicted 
that they and other long-distance carriers will find it tougher to make major 
inroads into AT&amp;T's business. "The past is prologue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert B. Morris III, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., called MCI's 
growth "very attractive," reflecting new products and new major customers, but 
said Sprint's results fell slightly below his forecast. 
</P>
<P>
In stock trading Tuesday, MCI closed at $38.625, off $1.25, and United Telecom 
closed at $68.625, down 37.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T is scheduled to report second-quarter results Thursday.

<P>
A worse-than-expected trade deficit undermined the stock market Tuesday, 
driving the Dow Jones industrial index to a second decline after a nine-day 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell 8.73 points to 2,544.76. 
</P>
<P>
Before the market opened, the Commerce Department announced that the nation's 
merchandise trade deficit rose to $10.24 billion in May, well above 
expectations of a $9-billion gap. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the stock market, which opened lower and never recovered, 
showed underlying strength by holding up as well as it did. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives ground grudgingly. There's still lots of cash on the sidelines," said 
Alan Ackerman, a Gruntal &amp; Co. analyst in New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decliners Outpace Advancers 
</P>
<P>
Still, two down sessions in a row have put a chill on the July rally, which saw 
the Dow rise 114.76 from the end of June through last Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's market decline, although modest, was more pronounced than Monday's, 
when the Dow slipped just 1.33 and advancing stocks narrowly outnumbered 
declining ones. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, decliners outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 8 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 152.35 million shares, up from 
131.96 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Laboratories led the list of most actively traded NYSE issues, rising 1 
to 34 1/2, after the announcement Tuesday that Dow Chemical had signed a 
definitive agreement to acquire 67% of its stock over the next two or three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
More than 13 million Marion shares changed hands in composite dealings, adding 
significantly to overall trading volume. Dow Chemical, meanwhile, fell 1 5/8 at 
86 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines, a blue chip bellwether, fell 1 1/4 to 114 3/4 
despite an earnings report that met expectations. The 39% quarterly gain was 
largely the result of special factors. The stock had risen by an identical 
amount Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer fell 1 1/2 to 39 1/4 in heavy over-the-counter trading after 
reporting a 5.3% earnings gain, below market expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Communications rose 1/4 to 65 5/8, Paramount Communications rose 3/4 to 
57 and Time fell 3 to 138. The companies are embroiled in a three-way takeover 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks eased as anxiety ahead of Japan's upper house elections on 
Sunday continued to paralyze the stock market. The Nikkei 225-share index 
retreated 112.49 points to close at 33,343.73. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices ended slightly lower on the London Stock Exchange, as the market 
absorbed news of the widened U.S. trade deficit. Trading closed at an hour 
earlier than usual, owing to a 24-hour strike by British public transport 
workers. The 100-share Financial Times index ended down 1.8 points at 2,273.1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices slumped after the government released its report on U.S. trade 
deficit figures, but analysts said some of the decline was a technical 
correction following the credit market's recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond, which lost 1/2 point or $5 per $1,000 face 
amount Monday, fell another 13/16, or about $8.13 per $1,000 face amount Its 
yield, which moves inversely to price, jumped to 8.19% from 8.12% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The credit markets were particularly shaken by a surge in imports, which 
investors believed could portend increased consumer demand and a reinvigorated 
economy, said Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy 
Research Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Traders fear that if the economy surges, the Federal Reserve Board is likely to 
tighten credit, driving interest rates higher and bond prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, calling Tuesday's losses a correction, said they were partly because 
the market has "gone too far too long without some kind of a setback." 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
fell about 3/16 point, intermediate maturities fell 5/16 point to 3/8 point and 
long-term issues fell 11/16 point, Telerate Inc., a financial information 
service, reported. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 3.94 to 1,182.38. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial and utility corporate bonds also weakened. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures return on a portfolio of 80 corporate 
bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 1.01 to 328.98. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.188%, down from 9.25% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar lost value against most major currencies in U.S. dealings that were 
hectic at times as traders reacted to the unexpectedly poor trade report. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, on foreign exchange markets abroad, the dollar finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices moved modestly higher at home after a mixed showing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery rose 
$1.60 to $372.60 an ounce. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of 
$371.90 for an ounce of bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, up $1.60 from Monday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
Simon Fischer, a vice president at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said currency 
trading was brisk immediately after the Commerce Department issued its trade 
report. 
</P>
<P>
News in the report that imports grew 4.3% to a record $40.71 billion in May 
implied that the U.S. economy remains strong because it is drawing in vast 
quantities of foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
This point fed bullish sentiment toward the dollar because it suggested that 
the Federal Reserve Board might be less inclined to drive down interest rates.

Citicorp and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. reported higher second-quarter earnings 
Tuesday while Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said its profit tumbled during the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp, the nation's largest banking concern, based in New York, said its net 
income for the three months ended June 30 rose 10% over the comparable 1988 
period to $395 million. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Hanover reported that its profit fell 74% to $106 million. The 
1988 second quarter included $336 million in one-time gains from asset sales 
and tax benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo's second-quarter net income rose 18% to $147.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citicorp 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp said its net interest revenue rose 8% to $1.84 billion, while other 
revenue rose 5% to $1.5 billion and non-interest expenses rose 6% to $2.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company took a $329-million provision for possible credit losses and wrote 
off $534 million in credit, including $223 million to debtor nations. Citicorp 
announced earlier in the year that it was writing down $185 million of medium- 
and long-term debt related to its Argentine loans. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp's total reserve for loan losses was $3.9 billion as of June 30, down 
from $4.5 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manny Hanny 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Hanover said its second-quarter results reflected strength in 
regional banking and global wholesale activities. Results for the year-earlier 
quarter included a $291-million gain from the sale of Manufacturers Hanover 
Consumer Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Net interest income was up nearly 1% to $453 million, while non-interest 
revenue fell 47.2% to $353 million and non-interest expense was nearly flat at 
$530 million. 
</P>
<P>
Net interest revenue was reduced by $38 million in the quarter and by $70 
million in the first six months because of $894 million in non-performing loans 
from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
The company took a provision for possible credit losses of $100 million in the 
second quarter, down from $133 million in the 1988 period. 
</P>
<P>
Net chargeoffs of loans to developing countries in the quarter totaled $291 
million, up from $56 million in the 1988 quarter. It included $247 million in 
net chargeoffs of medium- and long-term loans to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, Manufacturers Hanover's total loan-loss reserve was $2.06 
billion, down from $2.53 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, said its second-quarter benefited from 
increased net interest income from greater domestic loan volume. 
</P>
<P>
Net interest income was $531.5 million, compared to $482.1 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo took a $100-million provision for loan losses in the quarter and 
net loan chargeoffs were $42.7 million. Non-performing loans totaled $1.2 
billion as of June 30, down from $1.4 billion a year earlier.

BONNIE FRANKLIN DIRECTING 'MUNSTERS TODAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY BUCK, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonnie Franklin is spending the summer in Los Angeles, dealing with monsters 
and loving every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
The vivacious, red-haired actress, best known for the lead role in "One Day at 
a Time," is directing 12 episodes of "The Munsters Today," based on the 1960s 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I started directing when I was doing 'One Day' and I've continued doing it," 
Franklin said. "I directed a few episodes of 'The Munsters Today' and they 
asked me to direct all of them. I said I'd do 12. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The weird thing is I did an episode of 'The Munsters' when I was 18. I was a 
regular person on the show. I wasn't in makeup. I can't remember the role, but 
whenever it's rerun, I get mail." 
</P>
<P>
The show tells the story of the Munster family, which lives at 1313 Mockingbird 
Lane. Herman is 7 feet tall and looks like Frankenstein's monster. Lily 
resembles a vampire. Grandpa looks like Dracula, and son Eddie has the look of 
a werewolf. Niece Marilyn is the weird one -- she looks normal. 
</P>
<P>
In the new version, for first-run syndication, John Schuck is Herman, Lee 
Meriwether is Lily and Howard Morton is Grandpa. It's filmed in front of an 
audience at Universal Studios by the Arthur Co. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to change the show this year, which is better for me," Franklin 
said. "They know the show's going to appeal to children. Herman's got the green 
makeup and the bolt sticking out of his neck. But they want to expand the 
audience for more adult appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first show I directed, Herman and Lily have been married 300 years and 
are trying to make their marriage exciting and viable after that long. It still 
retains a silliness, but the stories now are fun for an adult to watch. And I 
enjoy directing them." 
</P>
<P>
She has also directed episodes of "Karen's Song" and "Charles in Charge." 
</P>
<P>
She's just back from six months of stage appearances in the East. She did 
"Annie Get Your Gun" with Byron Nease in the Bucks County Playhouse in 
Pennsylvania and "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune" with Tony Musante at 
the West Side Arts Theater in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very lucky," she said. "I had co-stars in both shows who were wonderful 
human beings. I'm going through a wonderful period. Life is great." 
</P>
<P>
Although born and raised in the Los Angeles area, Franklin said, she's an avid 
New Yorker. "When I was 16, I was an exchange student in Greece," she said. 
"When I came back, I stopped in New York. I loved the theater. Since then, I've 
been on the stage in New York many times." 
</P>
<P>
She began acting as a child, appearing with Donald O'Connor on "The Colgate 
Comedy Hour," and as a teen-ager joined Barbara Hershey and Richard Dreyfuss in 
guest roles on "Gidget," which starred Sally Field. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin was in the original Broadway production of "Applause" and in such 
plays as "Dames at Sea," "A Thousand Clowns," "George M!," "Carousel" and "The 
Owl and the Pussycat." She returned to Los Angeles to play Judd Hirsch's wife 
in the TV movie, "The Law." 
</P>
<P>
After that, she returned to New York, but producer Norman Lear had a project in 
mind for her. She ended up spending nine years with "One Day at a Time." 
</P>
<P>
Directing "The Munsters Today" calls for a lot of special effects, which are 
filmed the day before the actors go before the audience. That way, the studio 
audience can watch the special effects on the TV monitors. 
</P>
<P>
She honed her directing skills by watching directors on other three-camera 
shows, a common practice in the film business. She wants to learn single-camera 
directing and is now observing on ABC's "China Beach." 
</P>
<P>
"With the vagaries of the business, directing gives me a second career," 
Franklin said. "I don't have to sit around waiting for the networks to say, 
'Yes, go ahead with your new project.' I think the older you get, the more 
difficult it gets. I'm not giving up acting. I'm developing a new half-hour 
comedy series."

VIEWERS AREN'T SWITCHING CHANNELS, POLL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TV watchers who change channels during a program or zap to another station 
during the commercials are in the minority, ABC said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The results of a 1989 Roper poll were presented during the first day of ABC's 
annual press tour at the Century Plaza, where television journalists from 
around the country have gathered for two weeks of back-to-back news conferences 
on the fall television season. 
</P>
<P>
The poll found that only 11% of a sample of 1,000 adults flip channels while 
watching prime-time programming. 
</P>
<P>
The poll results, gathered from Jan. 29 to Feb. 11, also showed that the 
relatively few viewers who flip from one program to another are young, 
especially young males. 
</P>
<P>
One more finding: the degree of channel flipping was not changed significantly 
by the presence of children. 
</P>
<P>
Although ABC's advertisers may rest easier knowing that viewers usually stick 
to the program they plan to watch in the first place, 7% of viewers are still 
"grazing" around the dial during commercials, while a total of 3% change 
channels during the program itself. 
</P>
<P>
Reasons cited for flipping channels include "boredom" and "seeing what else is 
on." 
</P>
<P>
And, although ABC advertisers may be comforted to know audiences who begin 
watching an ABC show will watch until the end, they now also know that people 
watching NBC, CBS, Fox or cable are equally unlikely to pop over to ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, ABC hopes that audiences this fall will tune into and stick with 
"Chicken Soup," a new comedy starring Jackie Mason, produced by TV's Hitsville, 
Carsey/Werner Productions, which also produces "The Cosby Show" and "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
Mason and the show's four producers -- Marcy Carsey, Tom Werner, Saul 
Turteltaub and Bernie Orenstein -- turned out in force to reassure journalists 
that the comedy, about a Jewish man falling in love with his Catholic neighbor 
(Lynn Redgrave), would play in America's Heartland. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a journalist's suggestion that Middle America might not relate 
well to Mason's character, who will rely on the same sort of ethnic humor and 
dialect that is part of Mason's stand-up comedy act, the ever-tactful Mason 
said: "Whoever says that, in my honest opinion, has to be stupid -- and I say 
that with the highest respect." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all Jewish nonsense," Mason continued. "While I do my stand-up act all 
over the country, I am watching Gentiles laugh at my humor, and afterwards, 
Jews come up to me and say: 'It's a little too Jewish.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mason said that, following years of obscurity, he was propelled to stardom 
following the success of his stage show, which recently played in Los Angeles. 
The success led to numerous television offers, and critics suddenly begin 
praising his "one-man performance." 
</P>
<P>
"I always did a one-man performance -- what did they think, that before I was 
working with a choir?" Mason grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Mason said he took the role because the writers allowed him to be himself: "In 
the pilot (episode), I forgot that I didn't write it myself." 
</P>
<P>
Following the news conference, Mason said that anyone who objects to the 
Catholic-Jewish romance in "Chicken Soup" -- or anywhere else -- is "an idiot." 
</P>
<P>
Mason said he doesn't mind making fun of the nation's favorite controversies, 
including abortion and flag burning. "This is the only country in which you're 
allowed to burn the flag, but you're not allowed to tear the tag off the 
mattress," he said. Mason also does a routine about a newsstand owner who 
offers this opinion on abortion: "I'm against it -- unless of course the girl 
is pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
In the news conference, producers Carsey and Werner were asked for their 
formula for making hits; they attributed their success to simplicity, honestly 
and a respect for the audience. Mason eyed them suspiciously: "So, if it's so 
easy, why did it take you so long?"

COMPROMISE WATERS DOWN DURANG'S WIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Resident Theatre Company's production of Christopher Durang's "Beyond 
Therapy" offers a case-study in compromise in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, Durang's nasty appraisal of the state of personal 
relationships is set in the early 21st Century but still is meant to be 
symbolic of our generation. 
</P>
<P>
The Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton, where "Beyond Therapy" is 
staged, isn't used to such goings-on. Like most community theaters, typical 
seasons have avoided confronting subscribers with controversy -- the themes 
(homosexuality and promiscuity, among others) in Durang's black comedy aren't 
often explored. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Blank, the play's director, believes that it's about time for the 
Fullerton-based RTC and the Muckenthaler to take a few chances. But in the same 
breath, he admits that his handling of Durang is a compromise designed to put 
the writer's words and attitudes on stage, but in a way most palatable to the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Blank has to be admired for wanting to move in a more challenging direction. 
Trouble is, his approach, while capturing the essence of "Beyond Therapy," 
dilutes the acid that's supposed to seep through. Durang, a writer of uneven 
talents, is all about shock and offense, but here his vaguely subversive 
notions don't always register. 
</P>
<P>
The production's attempt at accessibility primarily affects the play's tone. 
Very little of the frank dialogue has been altered or excised, but the 
delineation of characters comes with the broadest of comic strokes that reach 
for guffaws rather than knowing grins. 
</P>
<P>
While working on the play's pacing, Blank said he felt compelled to have big 
laughs come often enough to keep the audience watching, despite the 
provocations. The results are, for the most part, overly wild 
characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: After we meet Prudence and Bruce (Carol Barbee and Patrick 
Rowe), the lonely neurotics who embark on a bizarre relationship after 
answering personal ads in the newspaper, we're introduced to her therapist 
(Steve Porter), a sexually dysfunctional sleazeball. 
</P>
<P>
Porter's therapist, with his rayon Melrose-Avenue duds and an unrequited desire 
to bed Prudence, is all leers, groping and innuendo. He gets lots of laughs, 
but he's a whoopee-cushion of a gag. "Beyond Therapy" isn't the subtlest 
comedy, but it is more pungent and complicated than that. 
</P>
<P>
This show works best during the scenes between Prudence and Bruce, especially 
their first meeting when Bruce reveals too much of his twisted self and 
Prudence reveals too little. Barbee shines, infusing Prudence with the needed 
cloud of bemusement (which often slips into numbed disgust) that hangs over 
everything she does. The fidgety, self-conscious Rowe reacts nicely to what 
she's all about. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce's male lover (Bruce proudly calls himself a bisexual) is given a clever 
reading by Carlos Lacamara, an actor who has mastered the mortified take. It's 
a fairly flouncing portrayal, but not over-baked. 
</P>
<P>
As for the setting (the year 2021), it doesn't really hurt the play, but 
neither does it add much. Besides the obvious point that finding love is sure 
to remain a difficult business, even in a Brave New World, there isn't any 
relevance to the decision. Of course, it does give Mela Hoyt-Heydon the 
opportunity to dress the men (but not the women for some reason) in 
semi-futuristic outfits, while allowing sound designer Brad Williams the chance 
to use a few spacey noises. Gil Morales' revolving Tomorrowland-like set, 
although crowded, is an adept solution to the play's needs. 
</P>
<P>
'BEYOND THERAPY'

BOY'S PLANE FLIPS, BURNS IN ALASKA; 
</P>
<P>
ENTOURAGE ESCAPES INJURY AS AIRCRAFT FALLS INTO BOG

<P>
Eleven-year-old Tony Aliengena and seven members of his round-the-world flight 
crew escaped serious injury Tuesday when their fully loaded plane flipped over 
and burned in a crosswind during takeoff from this remote Alaskan village. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena, the San Juan Capistrano youth seeking to become the youngest pilot 
to circumnavigate the globe, and the rest of his party scampered to safety 
after the plane crashed and began to burn in a bog just off the gravel landing 
strip. Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, 39, was at the controls at the time of 
the accident, which took place during a fishing trip detour from the record 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said the plane was destroyed. Four members of the party 
suffered facial cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real blessing that there was nobody killed," said Paul Steucke, a 
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration's Alaska Region. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Far to Turn Back' 
</P>
<P>
The single-engine, high-wing Cessna Centurion was destroyed by fire, Steucke 
said. He said the weather at the time of the crash was "lousy," but conditions 
were flyable. Clouds were down to 800 feet and it was drizzling. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the crash, Gary Aliengena said he hoped to get another plane and 
continue his son's globe-trotting journey. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come too far to turn back," he said just before the group boarded a 
commercial charter flight at about 11 p.m. Tuesday for Nome. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred in sun-lighted conditions around 8:45 p.m. local time as the 
boy and his passengers tried to fly from this Alaskan Eskimo village to Nome 
after a fishing trip. A Seward Peninsula community of 120 people situated on 
the Bering Sea 90 miles from Nome, Golovin is inaccessible except by boat and 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the expedition were shaken and disconsolate. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about the Friendship Flight right now," said the boy's mother, 
Susan, who is accompanying Tony on his journey along with other family members, 
friends and members of the media. "I'm just glad that we're all alive." 
</P>
<P>
Tony, meanwhile, was in tears at the Golovin Community Health Clinic. "This is 
the worst stop yet," he muttered. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a severe storm brought high winds, and heavy rain swept through the 
town on the Peninsula, where Tony and the others had stopped just days before 
he was scheduled to complete his seven-week odyssey, which began June 5 at John 
Wayne Airport in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight passengers on board, four suffered facial cuts -- Tony, his Soviet 
pen pal and traveling companion Roman Tchermenykh, the boy's father, Gary, and 
Joseph Lee, 29, of Los Angeles, a member of a film crew making a documentary on 
the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to give Tony a rest in anticipation of a planned 1,000-mile flight 
Wednesday from Nome to Juneau, the father was at the controls for the short hop 
Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was roaring down the runway at about 50 to 60 m.p.h., well short 
of its takeoff speed of 80 m.p.h., when a gust of wind lifted the plane off the 
runway, which sits along a 50-foot-high embankment. 
</P>
<P>
Before the pilot could react, the plane careened off the embankment and into 
the bog alongside the runway, hitting wing down and catching its wheels in the 
muck. A fire broke out immediately as the right wing hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"We bit the dust," Gary Alienga said later, describing the crash. 
</P>
<P>
As the passengers freed themselves and ran from the wrecked plane, a fishing 
guide who had watched the group take off ran down the runway yelling for them 
to get away from the burning aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a cloud of smoke and flames," said Eddie Smith, the guide. "I didn't 
think there would be any survivors." 
</P>
<P>
No one needed encouragement. Despite the goo of the swamp, which tore at least 
one passenger's shoe off as he stepped through it, the group managed to get 
away from the plane within seconds after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The trip across the United States and through Canada, Iceland, Scandinavia, the 
Soviet Union and then back down the West Coast of the U.S. and Canada was 
designed to make Tony the youngest pilot to circumnavigate the globe. 
</P>
<P>
The 17,000-mile journey also was significant because the boy became the first 
Westerner in recent memory allowed to pilot a plane across the Soviet Union. He 
was carrying "friendship" messages to Soviet children signed by their 
counterparts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He was originally scheduled to Southern California on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
While in Moscow, Tony was scheduled to meet with Soviet leader Mikhail 
Gorbachev and present him with a 1,000-foot-long scroll with the children's 
signatures. But the meeting with Gorbachev never took place because of the 
Soviet leader's busy schedule, and Tony met instead with other Soviet 
officials.

IRVINE COUNCIL PASSES LAW TO PROTECT OZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sweeping city ordinance, thought to be the most comprehensive law in the 
nation restricting chlorofluorocarbons and other compounds destroying the 
globe's protective ozone layer, was passed Tuesday night by the Irvine City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, passed by a vote of 4 to 1, will affect businesses that use or 
produce chlorofluorocarbons -- or CFCs. That includes the electronics industry, 
installers of insulation, fast-food packaging firms, air conditioners and 
refrigeration repair firms, as well as those who test fire-extinguishing 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, who cast the dissenting vote, accused 
the city of a "Big Brother mentality." She criticized the ordinance as being 
fraught with problems that will unfairly penalize Irvine residents and 
businesses. Residents will be unable to find air-conditioner repairmen willing 
to invest in costly recycling equipment, required under the law, and small 
businesses will not be able to compete with others who are not restricted by 
the costly requirements, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Larry Agran, who championed the ordinance with Councilman Cameron 
Cosgrove, countered that the depletion of the ozone is of global concern and 
that local cities can and should lead the way. With Irvine's large 
concentration of high-tech industries using CFCs, it is especially fitting that 
the city enact this law, he said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We make a significant contribution to the problem. We ought to make a 
significant contribution to the solution," Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
Answering one businessman's argument that federal and international agencies 
are addressing the problem, Agran hotly retorted, "If we wait until all these 
people take action, we might as well kiss off the future of the globe." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance severely restricts the use of chlorofluorocarbons, Halon and 
other substances that research has shown deplete the Earth's ozone layer, which 
protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet radiation. It also creates a 
position of environmental program coordinator to work with businesses affected, 
help them find alternative compounds and, where appropriate, grant exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 people addressed the council during the three-hour hearing, the second 
held on the controversial ordinance. Most represented businesses who opposed 
the ordinance, mostly on the grounds that the July 1, 1990, deadline for 
compliance was unrealistic or that no suitable alternative compounds were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was amended Tuesday to provide for an exemption procedure in an 
effort to respond to criticisms of business representatives at the first public 
hearing June 29. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Flood of Exemptions' 
</P>
<P>
"I believe you will have a flood of exemptions," said Keith Lamb of ICI 
America, representing producers of CFCs. He asked that methyl chloroform -- a 
solvent not allowed under the ordinance -- be removed from the banned list 
because it is a good substitute for CFCs and has a lower ozone depletion level. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Byington, an air-conditioning serviceman, said the ordinance will 
increase the price of home air-conditioner repairs by $140 to $200. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Western Digital said that if methyl chloroform is not allowed, 
his firm -- which is building a $100-million facility in Irvine -- will lose 
its manufacturing capability "and its leading edge in the world market," 
despite the fact that the company meets all state and federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"If this passes, we will be unable to run our facility," said Kasiuisuanatha 
Soundaranathan. 
</P>
<P>
But Agran responded: "The ordinance will not put you out of business. Just 
apply for an exemption, which puts the burden of proof on you." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition was not confined to business representatives. Bela Lengyel, a 
retired university physicist and Irvine resident, said the effect of the 
ordinance on the globe's ozone "would be too small to be detected by any known 
scientific method." 
</P>
<P>
The council, he said, is attacking "a global problem which can only be solved 
by international agreement. . . . I respectfully request the council to turn 
its attention to city business." 
</P>
<P>
But another scientist warned the council to not be too free with exemptions to 
the ordinance because they will dilute the effect. If Irvine's ordinance is 
copied by other cities and agencies, he said, "this ordinance could make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
And Livio F. Davanzo of the International Technology Corp. told the council 
that the protesting businesses are saying that "bottom-line profit is more 
important than the health of people." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans voting for the Moynihan amendment were Sens. William S. Cohen of 
Maine, Dave Durenberger of Minnesota, Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire and 
Arlen specter of Pennsylvania. Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama was the only 
Democrat voting against it. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is not expected to pass the overall foreign aid bill until later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROTECTING THE OZONE 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Irvine restrictions on ozone-damaging chemicals -- 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and tetrafluoroethylene polymer (Halon) -- would 
take effect July 1, 1990. The provisions would: 
</P>
<P>
Bar the manufacture of any ozone-depleting substance. 
</P>
<P>
Bar sale, purchase or use of food-packaging materials made of any 
ozone-depleting substance. 
</P>
<P>
Bar installation of building insulation containing any ozone-depleting 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
Restrict removal of ozone-depleting substances from construction to proper 
recovery and disposal (specifics yet to be determined). 
</P>
<P>
Require refrigeration and air-conditioning repair facilities to recycle and 
prevent release into the atmosphere of ozone-depleting chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Bar sale of ozone-depleting coolants for refrigeration or air-conditioning 
units, unless buyer has certified recycling system. 
</P>
<P>
Bar disposal of any ozone-depleting chemical from refrigeration or air- 
conditioning unit without recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Restrict use of Halon in fire extinguisher testing or training to instances 
required by law or to those with proper city permit. 
</P>
<P>
Require fire extinguisher service and repair facilities to recycle any Halon. 
</P>
<P>
Exceptions include licensed health-care facilities using these chemicals for 
sterilization, research on the effects of these chemicals and research on 
alternative technologies.

LYME DISEASE CONTRACTED BY LAGUNA BEACH WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Laguna Beach woman has contracted Lyme disease, apparently becoming the first 
person in Southern California to come down with the debilitating ailment since 
reporting it became mandatory this spring. 
</P>
<P>
State and local health officials on Tuesday called the case unusual, but said 
that although Lyme has become epidemic on the East Coast and coastal areas of 
Northern California, it is not a significant threat in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a relatively low-risk problem" locally, said Dr. Robert Murray, an 
epidemiologist with the California Department of Health Services. In areas that 
are hot and dry, the tick that carries the disease "can virtually disappear," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Greenwood, an Orange County health official in charge of communicable 
disease treatment, added that there may be some small area of infection in 
Orange County, "but generally speaking, we haven't seen it." Greenwood said he 
is waiting for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to confirm the 
Lyme diagnosis before adding it to county health records. 
</P>
<P>
First identified 14 years ago in Old Lyme, Conn., Lyme disease has swept the 
Northeast as well as Wisconsin, Minnesota and Northern California. The Centers 
for Disease Control, which recorded 526 cases in 1982, tracked more than 5,000 
cases in 1988. The "little bitty" deer tick that causes the disease is 
"spreading," explained CDC spokeswoman Gail Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey of Lyme disease in California, epidemiologist Murray studied 400 
cases from 1983 to 1987, 59% of those in Humboldt and Mendocino counties. 
</P>
<P>
Lyme-infected ticks seem to thrive in the moist, cool environment of coastal 
Northern California, Murray explained. "It requires just the right combination 
of events, a climate bathed by moist coastal breezes with dells and valleys and 
brush-covered hills where the ticks can survive for long periods of time and 
small rodent populations can act as a reservoir for the spirochete (the 
spiral-shaped bacteria that cause Lyme)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray said he found only two of the 400 cases in Orange County, six in Los 
Angeles County and three in San Diego County. Murray said he did not have 
statistics for 1988 and was now gathering data for 1989. Physicians have only 
been required to report the disease to state health officials since March 30. 
Murray confirmed that the Laguna Beach case appears to be the first report of 
Lyme from Southern California since reporting became required. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes dubbed "the great imitator," Lyme disease is characterized by flulike 
illness -- fatigue, headache, joint pains -- and frequently, a rash. Later 
symptoms, which can appear months after the initial infection, include 
inflammation of the heart, numbness and muscle weakness, meningitis and 
arthritis. Antibiotics can successfully treat the disease, although in a few 
patients permanent joint damage may occur, CDC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Laguna Beach case, a woman in her early 40s -- she has asked that 
officials not identify her publicly -- visited her doctor in May complaining of 
fatigue, headaches and a low-grade fever. She also had a rash below her arm pit 
and, according to physical medicine specialist F. P. Meyer, might have received 
a tick bite several weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
At the woman's request, Meyer conducted a blood test to see if her serum 
contained the spiral-shaped organism that causes Lyme. "Nobody was more 
surprised than I was when the test came back positive," Meyer said. "The health 
department has been telling us there hasn't been any in this region." 
</P>
<P>
He and county vector control officials theorize that the woman may have 
received a tick bite in her back yard, which borders one of Laguna Beach's 
brush-covered canyons. Deer, mice and rabbits, all of which carry the Western 
black-legged tick, inhabit the canyon, according to James Webb, county vector 
control biologist. 
</P>
<P>
Webb urged residents not to be "alarmists" about Lyme. But he suggested that 
anyone entering a brush-covered area should wear long trousers, not shorts, 
apply a good insect repellent such as DEET, and after leaving the brush conduct 
a thorough "tick check." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, the incidence of Lyme-infected ticks was less than in 
Central and Northern California, he said, "But I've walked through brush and 
picked up three or four ticks. . . . It only takes one." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Carrier 
</P>
<P>
Common name: Western black legged tick 
</P>
<P>
Latin name: Ixodes pacificus 
</P>
<P>
Color: Females, red-brown with black legs. Males, brownish black all around. 
</P>
<P>
Lifespan: 2 years 
</P>
<P>
Food: Blood 
</P>
<P>
Hosts: In early life cycle stages, the tick feeds off small rodents, lizards 
and birds. Adult ticks feed off large mammals such as deer, dogs and humans.

DANA POINT RESORT IS SOLD TO JAPAN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The oceanfront Dana Point Resort has been sold to a Japanese garment industry 
giant for about $104 million in what is one of the largest real estate deals in 
the Southland this year. 
</P>
<P>
The price represents a doubling in the value of the 12-acre property 
overlooking Dana Point Harbor in Orange County, built for $50 million in 1987, 
and demonstrates the torrid appreciation of coastal property. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Thomas Cos., owned by Beverly Hills hoteliers Edward and Thomas Slatkin, 
said the sale to Tokyo Masuiwaya California Corp. of Japan, the investment arm 
of Japan's leading kimono maker, was completed Tuesday. The Slatkins acquired 
the resort in February, 1988, for $65 million from Southmark Pacific Corp. in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management to Be Retained 
</P>
<P>
The Slatkins, whose family owned the Beverly Hills Hotel for 30 years, said in 
an interview Tuesday that Masuiwaya officials did not discuss plans for the 
resort with them but did retain the existing management. 
</P>
<P>
Masuiwaya officials declined to discuss the deal, according to a spokeswoman at 
Yasuda Bank &amp; Trust in Los Angeles, which represented the Japanese firm in 
the deal. Masuiwaya of California also owns the Cliffs resort, a new property 
near Pismo Beach, and La Jolla's Colonial Inn, an older, 10-room oceanfront 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate industry consultants said the price is a record for a single 
property in Orange County by a Japanese buyer and is one of the highest prices 
paid for a hotel in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, according to COMPS Inc., a San Diego research firm, the only Orange 
County real estate deal that approaches the Dana Point Resort sale was the 1988 
acquisition of two Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. office buildings in 
Newport Beach for $83 million by the California State Teachers Retirement 
System. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge appreciation that the Dana Point Resort sale represents, the 
price is not out of line for a coastal resort, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at recent hotel sales in Southern California, like La Costa Resort 
(in San Diego County) that sold for $250 million and Hotel Bel Air for $110 
million, it is in keeping with what is happening," said Jim Burba, a partner in 
the Costa Mesa office of Pannell Kerr Forster, an accounting firm and 
consultant to the hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Prime hotel property in Southern California is selling at very high prices in 
comparison to other parts of the U.S. because this is perceived to be a strong 
economy and a strong market," Burba said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promising O.C. Resort Center 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Masuiwaya is buying into an area that has a promising future 
as a resort center, said Richard N. Kipper, a partner at Laventhal &amp; 
Horwath in Costa Mesa. Developers have approval to build nine hotels as part of 
three projects, along the Irvine Coast between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach, 
in Huntington Beach and in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have to be aware of the plans for several major high-end resorts 
on the Orange County coast and are interested in coming in at the start of the 
creation of a prime resort environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Slatkin said the resort's occupancy rate currently is about 75%, up from 
only 50% last year. A 75% occupancy rate is considered good in the resort 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We upgraded and repositioned the hotel and refocused it to the resort 
business, and that had a lot to do with the price," Slatkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale does not, he said, represent an exit from the hotel business by the 
Edward Thomas Cos. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing you can read into this sale is that on a highly leveraged 
acquisition that we put almost no cash into, we got nearly 60% appreciation in 
one year and made an enormous amount of money," Slatkin said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and his brother intend to take the profit from the sale and "buy or 
build a fabulous new hotel or other business in the consumer field." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Hartnett, a consultant with Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in Newport Beach, 
said the Dana Point Resort deal is a continuation of the Japanese pattern of 
acquiring so-called "trophy" hotel properties that have a high visibility and 
prestige. 
</P>
<P>
"They did it first in Hawaii, and now that they have bought most of the major 
hotels there, they are turning to California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Japanese investors have acquired the Hotel Bel Air in Beverly 
Hills, La Costa Resort Hotel and Spa in Carlsbad and the Westin chain, which 
includes the Westin South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa and the Westin Bonaventure 
in Los Angeles.

COMMISSION VOTES TO EXPAND LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Planning Commission on Tuesday voted 4 to 1 to recommend an 
expansion of the Olinda Canyon landfill, which is scheduled to be at capacity 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The commission did not follow the recommendation of the County Waste Management 
Commission, which last week recommended that further studies be conducted on 
potential landfill sites in Gypsum Canyon and West Fremont Canyon, in addition 
to Olinda. The planning commissioners said the Board of Supervisors should 
decide which landfill site should receive further study. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors are scheduled to consider a location for a landfill in North Orange 
County at an Aug. 16 meeting.

PRINTER ADMITS GUILT IN COUNTERFEITING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Costa Mesa printer pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges of forging almost $10 
million in cash in what authorities say was one of the biggest counterfeiting 
schemes in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Tracing a trail of phony cash spotted in Orange, Los Angeles and Riverside 
counties, federal prosecutors charged after his arrest in April that Hal J. 
Stepanich, 33, produced the fake cash in a garage near Palm Springs, using 
about $10,000 in printing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities described the product -- in denominations of $20, $50, and $100 -- 
as passable to the untrained eye, but could be spotted under expert inspection 
because of discrepancies on the back of the bills. They believe that the bulk 
of the phony currency was recovered from a Costa Mesa hiding place before 
entering circulation. 
</P>
<P>
Stepanich, who worked as a pressman at a Costa Mesa print shop until February, 
was to have gone on trial beginning Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Santa 
Ana. Instead, he changed his plea to guilty after reaching an agreement last 
week with federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors agreed to recognize Stepanich's cooperation in leading authorities 
to the hidden cash after his April arrest and providing other information. That 
acknowledgement by prosecutors may help him at his Sept. 26 sentencing, his 
attorney said. Stepanich could face more than three years in prison on the 
counterfeiting conviction under federal sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Another former Orange County man who allegedly conspired in the plot, Richard 
L. Wattel, 62, pleaded guilty earlier this month in U.S. District Court in 
Houston to two counterfeit-related charges, court officials there said Tuesday. 
A longtime friend of the Stepanich family, Wattel is to be sentenced Sept. 11.

LAND TRANSFER TO HELP PLANS FOR REGIONAL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday accepted 114 acres at Upper Newport Bay 
from the Irvine Co. to complete a regional park on the area's scenic bluffs 
overlooking an ecological reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The county already owns about 16 acres on the bay along Jamboree Road that will 
connect with the 114 acres received Tuesday. The new acquisition extends west 
from Jamboree Road and then along the north side of the bay. Both properties 
also join the 700-acre state ecological reserve operated by the California 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
With the dedication, the county hopes to begin plans for a regional park that 
could include a nature museum, a network of hiking trails and platforms at 
strategic locations for viewing the unique wildlife of the Upper Newport Bay.

DANA POINT OFFICIALS HOPE AN ACTIVIST MODUS OPERANDI TAKES HOLD FOR GOOD 
</P>

<P>
New cities, like new homeowners, have to sort out various things before they 
officially put out the welcome mat. On Tuesday, the new city of Dana Point 
reached that stage. 
</P>
<P>
Amid blue balloons and lighthearted ceremony, city officials unveiled the first 
"Welcome to Dana Point" sign at the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
"You all know we worked super hard for incorporation," said Mayor Eileen Krause 
as she unveiled the first sign at the corner of Golden Lantern Street and 
Camino del Avion. 
</P>
<P>
It was pleasant to have such a non-controversial chore, Krause and other City 
Council members said. Although little Dana Point has existed just six months, 
it already has encountered some big problems, including traffic, mobile-home 
rent disputes and dayworkers. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't try to hide problems in our city, but try to resolve them," Krause 
said. "We've got a lot of energy in this city. We're a city of doers." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy Curreri said she thinks it particularly significant that the 
new city took up the dayworker issue. The City Council last week passed an 
ordinance outlawing street solicitation of jobs, a move aimed at preventing 
laborers from lining Doheny Park Road, seeking jobs from people who drive by. 
At the same time, the city announced plans to establish a bilingual phone bank 
that workers can call for job openings. 
</P>
<P>
"The day-laborer issue is an international problem," Curreri said. "We won't 
solve the cause of it, but maybe we can facilitate their hiring by having a 
phone bank arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally feel there are some south county cities that prefer to feel there 
isn't that problem because it isn't right there on their property," the mayor 
said. "And yet these dayworkers live in their area, and the work itself is in 
their area, not in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
"In our city, we just didn't hide from the problem or deny it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mike Eggers said another issue the city has tackled is the thorny 
rent-increase proposal at a mobile home park in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people thought we shouldn't get involved in the mobile-home issue at 
all," he said, "but we've been trying to bring both sides together on this." 
</P>
<P>
Curreri said the city is also looking for a comprehensive way to tackle traffic 
problems: "The Traffic Commission is trying to hold some workshops in the 
communities to find what needs to be done overall. We've handled some 
individual traffic issues, but my belief is that if you try to solve traffic on 
one street or two streets, it will simply impact somewhere else. You've got to 
look at it overall." 
</P>
<P>
Krause said the city is also fighting drug abuse: "We already have a drug task 
force, and we're going to try to have a drug-free Dana Point. I'd say that's a 
pretty lofty goal." 
</P>
<P>
The new welcome sign unveiled Tuesday is blue, for a nautical theme, with a 
depiction of the square-rigger Pilgrim, berthed in the harbor. The current 
Pilgrim is a reproduction of the brig on which Richard Henry Dana Jr. sailed 
down the Pacific Coast in 1834-36 and about which he wrote his classic book 
"Two Years Before the Mast." Dana Point is named for him. 
</P>
<P>
Don Porter, an assistant to the city manager, said seven more welcome signs 
will be placed at other entrances to the city by the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ingrid McGuire said some of the signs will note entrances to the 
communities of Monarch Beach and Capistrano Beach, which are part of Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
The signs, she said, recognize "the fact that it really is a city of three 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
Krause said that even with the its problems, "our future is going to be 
exciting. When you start with a clean slate, you can do anything."

UCI'S AYALA IS FIRST BREN FELLOW

<P>
UC Irvine professor Francisco Ayala on Tuesday was named the first of what will 
be many Bren Fellows, launching an intellectual fraternity and perpetual 
endowment that will be the legacies of Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren and 
UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason. 
</P>
<P>
The Bren Fellows Program, which is eventually expected to generate $7 million 
to $12 million annually for the university from lease income, will allow UCI to 
attract the world's foremost scholars and leap ahead as an international center 
of research and science, Peltason said during a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The secret of building a great university is no secret," Peltason said. "You 
get the brightest people you can and put them together to interact. Through the 
Bren Fellows Program, these scholars will have funds and direction." 
</P>
<P>
Ayala, a distinguished professor of evolutionary biology, was also named 
director of the program. Bren, the multimillionaire development company 
executive, also announced his second monetary gift to the fellowship -- $1 
million, for a total $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he considers the scholarly circle his legacy, Bren, 56, said, 
"One could call it that." 
</P>
<P>
But the program, and the real estate deal that made it possible, will also be 
Peltason's bequest to UCI. Peltason is expected to retire in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
After five years of talks with Bren, Peltason last year won the Irvine Co.'s 
agreement to lift a deed restriction that had prevented the university from 
developing valuable campus-edge property purchased from the firm in 1960. The 
pact allows UCI to move ahead with plans for a 135-acre research park on the 
condition that commercial lease income will be pumped back into the fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
Peltason said it is impossible to predict how many Bren Fellows the program 
eventually will establish but estimated that at least 10 will be needed to 
generate an intellectual "critical mass" that would include other distinguished 
professors and endowed chair holders at UCI. In accordance with Bren's wishes, 
the initial fellows will be in health or basic science fields. 
</P>
<P>
At least $1 million in additional lease income or donations will be required to 
endow each additional Bren Fellow, according to guidelines approved by the UC 
regents. The first Bren programs, including symposiums and lectures, will be 
offered in the 1989-90 academic year, Ayala said, gathering the nucleus of an 
interdisciplinary intelligentsia.

The U.S. government has rejected the conditions proposed by fugitive Charles 
McVey under which the former Anaheim businessman accused of selling 
supercomputer technology to the Soviet Union would voluntarily return to the 
United States, a lawyer for the United States said. 
</P>
<P>
"His offer is unacceptable and unrealistic," Canadian lawyer Bill Halprin said 
Monday. He represents the U.S. government in the extradition case that has been 
going on for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
McVey, 64, is a Villa Park resident who was indicted in 1983 for allegedly 
conspiring to illegally export $15 million worth of state-of-the-art computers 
and other equipment to the Soviet Union over a 4 1/2-year period. He and two 
other men -- Rold Leinhard, a Swiss national, and Yuri Boyarinov, a Soviet 
national -- also were charged with conspiracy and making false statements to 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
McVey fled the United States in 1982, shortly before being indicted, and was 
then placed on the most-wanted list of the U.S. Customs Service that set up a 
program called Operation Exodus to prevent the sale of high technology to East 
Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
Halprin, in announcing the government's rejection of McVey's demands, said he 
had placed unacceptable conditions on his offer to return voluntarily, 
including a request that the U.S. government provide him with a defense lawyer 
and put him on trial within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
McVey has been jailed here since August, 1987, while fighting extradition on 
more than 20 charges, including conspiracy and making false statements. He was 
arrested in August, 1987, while on a fishing trip in Canada's Yukon Territory.

It wasn't the finest two minutes and 11 seconds of Frank Wattles' life, but it 
will have to do for now. Look at it this way: at least there was someone else 
in the pool, which is a bit of a change for this loneliest of swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh from a flu bout, limping noticeably on a sprained ankle, Wattles, a 
member of the modest Mission Viejo Aquatics Club, climbed atop the starting 
platform for the first event of the 1989 U.S. Olympic Festival -- the 200-meter 
individual medley -- and proceeded to finish seventh in a race he considers his 
specialty. As debuts go, it wasn't exactly what he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Wattles' swim career hasn't gone exactly as planned. At 18, he 
finds himself swimming against conventional wisdom, the result, in part, of a 
nasty departure several years ago from the acclaimed Mission Viejo Nadadores. 
Lawsuits were filed. Allegiances were changed. Caught in the middle was 
Wattles, who essentially now trains for and by himself. The Aquatics Club? 
Except for the occasional workout partners, Wattles is the men's team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like Rocky," he said Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
As best as Wattles knows, he is the only elite-category swimmer in the country 
who does a solo training act. It is a lonely existence: a morning schedule that 
includes stretching exercises, weightlifting and running, followed by an 
afternoon schedules that features lots of work on stroke techniques. Swimming 
is a solitary sport to begin with -- you against the second hand -- but imagine 
the discipline needed to compete against phantoms every day. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Frank Wattles III, coaches the Aquatics Club and its most 
celebrated member. He tinkers with his son's strokes, trying always to 
streamline the effort needed to move 175 pounds through a lane of water. It 
isn't an easy chore, a fact not lost on area swim coaches who, according to the 
younger Wattles, have tried to recruit the talented medley swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
They're wasting their time -- Wattles &amp; Son is here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fine where I am now," he said. "I choose to do it the way I am." 
</P>
<P>
Ignore Tuesday night's results at the newly christened Oklahoma City Community 
College pool, and Wattles has done quite nicely. He won the 100-yard backstroke 
at this year's Junior Olympics championships and the 100-yard freestyle at the 
Junior Olympics in 1988. The Junior Olympics is generally regarded as the most 
competitive 18-and-under meet in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Now this. Now he finds himself, curiously enough, assigned to the North team 
here at the Festival. At last, teammates and the chance to swim a relay. It is 
an odd, wonderful feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun," he said. "It's a new thing. I haven't been in anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
And the most memorable moment of it all? 
</P>
<P>
"Being on a national team and getting free sweats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his many successes -- and the free wardrobe -- Wattles said his 
training methods are not for everyone. Actually, he said, they're not for 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of me, I kind of like it," he said, "but I wouldn't recommend it to 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Father and son were together again Tuesday night. Wattles III was the one with 
the video camera and the encouraging smile after the seventh-place finish. 
Wattles IV was the one with the limp. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank is good to work with," said the elder Wattles. "He does a good job. But 
he could have been better prepared for this." 
</P>
<P>
Two healthy ankles would have helped, as would would have a flu-less June. But 
some things can't be helped, so Wattles did what he could. Too bad it had to be 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Wattles, who spent last semester at Saddleback College, plans to take his swim 
stroke to USC soon. That should be interesting: a coach who isn't a blood 
relative, a 50-meter rather than 25-meter-long pool to conduct his training, a 
more demanding training schedule. And someone to swim with. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, there are signs that Wattles' attitude toward solitary training is 
softening. Bored with a post-swim interview, he asked to be excused so he could 
watch, of all things, his North teammates compete. And later, in the final 
event of the evening -- the 400-meter freestyle relay -- Wattles did something 
he couldn't do by himself: earn a gold medal. There's something symmetrical to 
that.

TRADE DEFICIT WORSENING UNDER SURGE OF IMPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The nation's stubborn trade deficit took an unexpected turn for the worse in 
May, ballooning to $10.24 billion, well above the 1989 low of $8.29 billion 
recorded in April, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Imports were the main reason for the deeper lurch into the red, as often has 
been the case in the past. U.S. business, still on an investment boom, 
continued to import nearly $20 billion in capital goods and industrial 
materials, which together counted for more than half of May's $1.7-billion 
increase in imported goods over April. Oil imports, boosted by higher prices 
and a 14% increase in volume, also soared by $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, exports of American-made and American-grown goods remained at 
near-record highs. 
</P>
<P>
Economists disagreed on whether the report points to an economy facing a rapid 
slowdown. But there was consensus that the strong trade improvement of the last 
18 months is now subsiding rapidly and that it likely will stall in the second 
half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"These numbers for May are definitely bad news," said Howard Lewis, 
international trade specialist at the National Assn. of Manufacturers. "We're 
still on track for an improvement in the trade deficit this year, but it will 
be smaller than last year and there's trouble ahead for 1990 and 1991," he said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York, agreed 
that the trade reversal in May probably was the start of a trend, after a 
period in which imports slowed and exports boomed. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be zigs and zags, month to month, but the improvement is now 
definitely flattening and the deficits may start getting worse," Kellner said. 
</P>
<P>
He added another warning: "The key point is that this is one more sign that the 
economy is in serious trouble. Since the growth in exports is declining, that 
could remove one of the last remaining props under economic activity. And the 
fact that imports are growing while consumer spending is declining clearly 
denotes a lack of competitiveness in many industries." 
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in the deficit was well above the financial markets' 
expectations of a modest increase to about $9 billion. While export levels 
remained high, May's total slipped $300 million below the $30.76 billion of 
products shipped overseas in April, the all-time record for merchandise 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
Kellner noted that the U.S. trade balance with virtually every part of the 
world worsened in May. The biggest imbalance, with Japan, grew from $3.89 
billion to $4.28 billion. The deficit with developing countries went from $3.63 
billion to $4.99 billion, while a small $231-million surplus with Western 
Europe tipped back into a $78-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But analyst Giulio Martini of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York was 
less pessimistic about the outlook for the economy. Noting that May's export 
total was within 1% of the April record high, and that the $800-million 
increase in imported capital goods outweighed the $100-million surge in 
consumer imports, he projected continued economic growth ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"The worry is on the import side," he said. Because industry is still investing 
heavily in foreign-made equipment and machinery, "you see a consistent increase 
in imports." Larger trade deficits may continue for the foreseeable future, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To some economists, the continuing flood of capital goods into the United 
States is begining to send an ominous signal. "To invest in machinery, to 
modernize is a good thing," Lewis said, "but a lot of this reflects the fact 
that we no longer make a lot of these products any more. It would be a hell of 
a lot better if more of these capital goods were coming from the domestic 
side." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he expects that continued slackening in the improvement in the trade 
deficit could trigger renewed pressure in Congress for punitive measures 
against nations that run a large trade surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit for 1989 should wind up $10 billion to $15 billion better 
than 1988's $118.53 billion, he said, but in the monthly tallies ahead, "we 
don't expect it to get better. We expect it to bottom out and get worse." 
</P>
<P>
". . . When a lot of people in this town who expect the trade deficit will keep 
on improving realize that it is hitting a wall around $110 billion, then we'll 
get a re-ignition of the debate on trade policy that could make 1987 look like 
a picnic," he said, referring to the big push for the trade-reform measure that 
finally became law last year.

13 OF GM MODELS FOR 1990 TO GET AIR BAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WARREN, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Driver-side air bags will be standard in 13 models of General Motors Corp.'s 
1990 cars, costing the auto maker at least $500 per car, the company's 
president said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Stempel refused to disclose what the device would cost consumers, but 
said the company has spent nearly $1 billion in research, design, development 
and labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
The cost per car could drop if consumers want the air bags on more models. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government requires all cars made in the United States after Sept. 
1 to have a passive restraint system for front-seat riders. That could involve 
air bags or automatic seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
An exemption in the law allows auto makers who put air bags on the driver's 
side to equip the passenger's side with a manual lap-and-shoulder belt system 
until Sept. 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The company said about 500,000 1990 cars, or less than 15% of GM's car fleet, 
would have the systems as standard equipment. Included are: 
</P>
<P>
* Buick Reatta and Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
* Cadillac Allante, DeVille, Eldorado, Fleetwood and Seville. 
</P>
<P>
* Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
* Geo Metro Convertible, later in the model year, and Storm. 
</P>
<P>
* Oldsmobile Toronado. 
</P>
<P>
* Pontiac Firebird. 
</P>
<P>
All other GM cars will have automatic seat belts for front-seat passengers. 
</P>
<P>
All of Chrysler Corp.'s U.S.-made cars for the 1990 model year will have 
driver-side air bags and manual lap-shoulder belts as standard equipment. The 
U.S.-made cars compose 90% of Chrysler's automobile fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. has said that about 1 million of its 1990 model cars, or about 
half of its car fleet, will have driver-side air bags. 
</P>
<P>
Auto industry observers expect higher prices for 1990 cars, partly because of 
the passive-restraint law.

<P>
OFFICE VACANCY RATE DIPS 0.5% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were a couple of snippets of good news for office landlords in a recent 
survey by Coldwell Banker. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's second-quarter survey of county commercial real estate showed that 
the office vacancy rate declined slightly, to 21.5% from 22% in the first 
quarter, and the average asking monthly lease rate rose 9 cents, to $1.62 per 
square foot. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy rate has been above 20% since the 1986 first quarter, according to 
Coldwell Banker, which estimates a three-year supply of existing office space 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The firm expects 3.6 million square feet of space to be added in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Net absorption of space in the recent quarter was 694,608 square feet, a 1% 
drop from the first quarter.

<P>
James W. Howard, vice president of Kitchell Development Co., was named 
president of Kitchell Contractors in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
He succeeds Greg Denk, who was promoted to executive vice president and chief 
operating officer of Kitchell Corp., the contractor's parent company in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Denk is credited with taking Kitchell Contractors' California revenue from $30 
million in 1980 to the more than $120 million projected for 1989. That makes it 
one of the county's five largest contractors, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, employed at Kitchell since 1980, will oversee such construction 
projects as Irvine City Hall, Western Digital's new headquarters in Irvine and 
Fiesta Marketplace in Santa Ana.

SPECIALISTS PROVIDE THOSE HARD-TO-GET PARTS FOR EXOTIC IMPORTED CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When people describe Southern California as the car capital of the world, they 
mean not only the sheer number of cars, but also the variety. Ubiquitous 
Chevrolets and Hondas share the roadway with less common Triumphs from Britain, 
Porsches from West Germany and Alfa Romeos from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Yet common or rare, they all eventually need new parts -- the average new car 
has 15,000 of them. If you drive a Chevy, buying parts is often as simple as 
going to a nearby Chief or Pep Boys store, or perhaps the nearest Chevrolet 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
But what if you drive an MG -- which is no longer manufactured -- and need a 
water pump? Or a 1960 Porsche 356 blows out its clutch? Or a 20-year-old Alfa 
Romeo Spider needs a U-joint? You could try a big chain like Chief, but there's 
no guarantee it carries the part. A Porsche or Alfa dealership might have it, 
but you'll pay top dollar and you might have to wait for the dealer to order 
it. 
</P>
<P>
So owners of such cars often go see Marty Osborne, Mel Kay or John Shankle. All 
run firms in the San Fernando Valley that specialize in selling parts for 
exotic European imports, and at prices that often undercut the dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The three firms do much of their business by mail order, and in that market 
alone they must vie against dozens of other independent parts suppliers 
nationwide. Each of the three advertises in Road &amp; Track, Car and Driver 
and other car-buff magazines, and each has a toll-free telephone number to take 
orders. Kay and Shankle send parts catalogues to thousands of potential 
customers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
But for Osborne, Kay and Shankle, that's where the similarity ends. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Osborne's Import Motor Parts in Sherman Oaks, which sells parts for 
British cars only, is no Pep Boys. His one-room store looks a bit tattered and 
grimy, and his two telephones are covered with his greasy fingerprints. 
Pictures of old British roadsters hang on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
There's no computer here to track Osborne's inventory of hundreds of parts. But 
Osborne doesn't need one. The inventory is stored in Osborne's head. And if he 
doesn't have the exact part, Osborne knows how to get it either from another 
supplier or by improvising. 
</P>
<P>
"No book said that an MGB U-joint is the same as a Lotus, and it is," said the 
broad, 6-foot-4 Osborne, whose runs his shop in T-shirt, jeans and tennis 
shoes. "No one knows that, but I do." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne, 38, buys his parts from a handful of major suppliers from Britain, but 
he also buys wrecks of British cars for salable parts. For instance, Osborne 
sells the metal panel that surrounds the radio -- and includes the radio's 
speakers -- for a 1969 Jaguar XKE. Price: $200. "I rebuild water pumps, 
clutches, transmission, I do a lot of engines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Import Motor Parts is able to survive is because some British cars 
are no longer made, and thus are considered collectibles, he said. "The last 
new MG and Triumph you could buy in this country was in 1980," he said. "I've 
seen MGBs go from being a $100 car to a $5,000 and $6,000 car now. So people 
come in and they want all these little pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne's father moved his family from Britain to Southern California in 1954 
because Marty suffered from asthma. His father went to work for a Rolls 
Royce-Jaguar dealership in Pasadena, then bought into Import Motor Parts and 
eventually took over the business. But after the elder Osborne had a stroke in 
1984, Marty Osborne abandoned his goal of going to veterinary school and began 
selling parts fulltime. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, Import Motor Parts had sold parts for a variety of foreign cars, 
and had sales of about $720,000 a year and seven employees, Osborne said. But 
when Osborne took over, parts chains such as Chief were mushrooming, and 
Osborne said he concluded "there's no way I can compete with these people." So 
he focused only on British models, kept just one employee to deliver parts, and 
now does about $250,000 in sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne is trying to build his mail-order business, which accounts for 30% of 
his sales. He has a facsimile machine and a toll-free telephone number, and 
gets orders from as far away as New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
He claims he'd keep working even if he won the lottery because "I really love 
what I do." Besides, he said, "I don't have a business to sell really. If I'm 
not here, no one could really do it. It's all in my memory." 
</P>
<P>
John Shankle only tacitly acknowledges it, but his Shankle Engineering in 
Chatsworth, which sells replacement parts for Alfa Romeos, thrives in large 
part because the Alfa is not the most reliable car on earth. 
</P>
<P>
Shankle, 55, diplomatically calls the Italian sports car "more temperamental" 
than most others. "They are really great cars, basically, but they have these 
little idiosyncrasies that crop up," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the workings of their electrical parts "are just totally 
puzzling," Shankle said. "I've often wondered how Marconi invented the radio. I 
think he was trying to design a meat grinder and somehow made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Alfa engines in older models also are notorious for being unable to keep the 
crankcase oil from mixing with the cooling system's water, which causes the 
engine to overheat. So Shankle sells a $46 "sure seal" kit he designed that 
re-routes the oil to reduce the engine pressure that causes the leakage. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these problems, Alfa owners are considered loyal and many tinker with 
their cars enough to keep Shankle Engineering's 10 workers busy, even though 
the market for Alfas is relatively small. His firm figures there are only about 
25,000 to 40,000 Alfas on the road nationwide; by contrast, Honda sold 11,800 
cars in late-June alone. 
</P>
<P>
Shankle bought his first Alfa in 1958, then raced the cars for the next decade. 
An engineer by trade, he started his parts business in 1967 mainly to sell 
racing-type parts to jazz up Alfas. He eventually began selling replacement 
parts as well, and now also sells add-on parts for Hondas. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of Shankle's parts are shipped to mail-order customers, and he 
estimated the firm's sales this year would reach $850,000. He doesn't have to 
look far for competition. To the east in Glendale is Alfa Ricambi, an Alfa 
parts dealer with more than 20,000 replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
But Shankle sees his own market remaining stable. "My hunch is that 20 years 
from now, you won't see many people fussing around with Honda CRXs, but they 
still will be playing with their Alfas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Import Motor Parts is a corner drugstore of parts, Performance Products in 
Van Nuys is a department store. Performance, which sells only parts for 
Porsches, has a cramped but clean front entrance chock-full of neatly displayed 
parts and accessories to tempt walk-in buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Like Shankle Engineering, Performance sells 90% of its parts by mail order, and 
the heart of Performance is in back where it keeps rows of parts stacked 10 
feet high. The firm does not sell used or rebuilt items, only new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a year Performance sends its slick, 170-page catalogue to more than 
200,000 Porsche owners nationwide. Owner Mel Kay's mailing list is compiled 
from names of previous customers and lists of drivers from state department of 
motor vehicle offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Kay asserts that "we're the Nordstrom of the auto-parts business." But he's 
referring more to Nordstrom's renowned attention to service than to the 
department store's size. 
</P>
<P>
Performance Products prospers mainly because Porsche dealers provide only 
grudging help for customers needing parts, said Kay. "The dealers' attitude is 
really what helps us in this business; they don't treat people properly," said 
Kay, who ran a surgical supplies firm before he and a partner bought 
Performance five years ago. The partner has since died, leaving Kay sole owner. 
The firm was started 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Kay, 51, contends he outperforms the dealers by giving refunds, referring 
customers to other dealers if Performance doesn't have the part, talking with 
customers to ensure they are ordering the part they need and undercutting the 
dealers on price. 
</P>
<P>
Kay won't reveal Performance's exact sales, except to say they're less than $10 
million and that the firm is 2 1/2 times bigger than when he took over. 
Regardless, it's clear the firm is a multimillion-dollar business. Performance 
uses computers to monitor its inventory of 5,000 parts, help its 30 employees 
answer questions from callers and help design its semi-annual catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
At Performance, you can buy a starter for a 1955 Porsche 356 for $89.50, or a 
windshield-wiper motor for a 1965 Porsche 911 for $325. How about a plastic 
cover to protect the rear of your Porsche 944s side-view mirrors from flying 
pebbles? Kay sells them for $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
Performance, like many other parts houses, can sell parts for less than car 
dealers because the parts houses usually buy directly from suppliers, Kay said. 
Dealers, by contrast, often buy parts at the end of a long distribution line 
that includes the German supplier, North American distributors and other 
middlemen, all of whom make the part more expensive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kay says he gets all kinds of customers. He recalled the time a Porsche owner 
drove up with a shoe-sized dent in his door. Kay said that when he asked what 
happened the driver said, " 'My girlfriend feels that I treat the car better 
than her. She got so mad she put her foot in the door.' " 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that one way or another cars take a beating, and when they 
do, Kay is ready.

Aeroflot Seeks to Join IATA: The Soviet airline Aeroflot applied to join the 
187-member International Air Transportation Assn., IATA said. IATA spokesman 
John Brindley said acceptance was a formality and Aeroflot, the largest 
non-IATA airline in the world, should become a member within two or three 
weeks. He said it was not likely to affect Aeroflot fares, since IATA fare 
decisions are not binding, but it was likely to help bring Aeroflot procedures 
and documentation into line with international practice. Airlines also can 
exchange information quickly through IATA in the event of a hijacking or bomb 
threat.

POST STORY ON CARMEN WAS INCORRECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On July 11, The Times published a story from the Washington Post reporting that 
Gerald Carmen, former head of the Federal Asset Disposition Assn., a unit of 
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, helped arrange a meeting with a bank board 
official on behalf of a client who was seeking a contract to manage foreclosed 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
The Post said Tuesday that it subsequently learned that Carmen did not set up 
the meeting, which was arranged by a person who works at Financial Institution 
Services Corp., as does Carmen, and who attended the meeting with Carmen. 
Carmen is president of FISC but is not the controlling shareholder, according 
to a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that, contrary to unattributed statements in the Post's 
article, Carmen had not profited from "contacts" at the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development and FHLBB but rather had used his government "knowledge 
and experience" to assist clients and pursue business interests. 
</P>
<P>
The article also reported incorrectly that Carmen had been a Republican 
fund-raiser in New Hampshire and was a former car dealer. He had been a 
Republican Party official and was in the tire business, the spokesman said.

4 FIREFIGHTERS HURT IN FACTORY FIRE

<P>
A fire raced through a sofa factory in Sepulveda, causing $700,000 in damage 
and slightly injuring four firefighters, the Los Angeles Fire Department said 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the blaze at Krause's Sofa Factory, a large one-story 
warehouse-style building, was unknown and under investigation, Fire Department 
spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at 10:45 p.m. Tuesday, Wells said. About 70 firefighters 
were able to control the fire in 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
While firefighters were battling the blaze, an apparent air draft inside the 
building caused a fireball to explode through a side door, Fire Department 
officials said. The blast shattered the windows on one fire truck parked on 
Orion Street and flames singed another truck. 
</P>
<P>
Four firefighters suffered minor injuries while fighting the blaze, including 
one man who was struck in the leg by a fire hose that broke loose, officials 
said. Two firefighters were treated at Northridge Hospital Medical Center and 
released, and the other two were treated at the scene by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
A pool supply company adjoining the factory was also slightly damaged by the 
blaze, he said.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating the death of a 
woman who was found shot to death this morning on a street in the Lopez Canyon 
area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the unidentified woman was found by a Los Angeles police officer on 
patrol at 3:36 a.m. in the 12300 block of Paxton Avenue, Sgt. Bryan Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That part of Paxton Avenue is in a small unincorporated area between Lake View 
Terrace and Pacoima, and Los Angeles police officers routinely use the street 
when driving between the two areas. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said detectives have not determined a motive for the shooting and have 
no suspects.

IRVINE PLAN TO REQUIRE DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE LOW-INCOME UNITS STALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine City Council postponed action early today until Aug. 22 on a 
controversial plan that would require developers to price 10% of future housing 
for very low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
The council asked for additional information from the city staff regarding the 
establishment of a nonprofit corporation to develop low-cost housing as well as 
studying a top figure on a fee that might be imposed on businesses to finance 
housing for employees. 
</P>
<P>
The plan before the council would require 10% of future housing to be priced 
for families earning less than $24,000, or half of the county median income. 
</P>
<P>
The largest opponent is the Irvine Co., which contended Tuesday night that such 
quotas have not been successful in producing significant amounts of low-cost 
housing in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials asked the city to establish a blue-ribbon committee that 
would find new ways to generate funds and entice nonprofit developers. 
</P>
<P>
If the city does not provide any incentives to private developers in the form 
of bond financing, the Irvine Co. suggested changing the plan to require 3% of 
housing for very low-income families and 7% for the next higher category, 
families earning up to 80% of the median. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Ray Watson called those figures "a shame" and said the 
city and company must work together to improve them. 
</P>
<P>
Several City Council members said the 10% figure is not unreasonable, pointing 
out that one recent development project priced 20% of its units for low-income 
residents.

POLICE AWAITING RESULT OF DONNIE MOORE AUTOPSY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Police today were awaiting autopsy results for former California Angels star 
relief pitcher Donnie Moore, who fatally shot himself in the head after 
seriously wounding his wife during an argument in their Anaheim Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
Tonya Moore, 35, the baseball player's wife, was hospitalized in critical 
condition Tuesday with at least three gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen; 
her condition today was upgraded to serious, said Donna Donan-Drasner, director 
of public affairs for Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Anaheim. She remains 
in the hospital's intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's 17-year-old daughter, Demetria, drove her mother to the hospital, 
where she collapsed. A CT scan showed that no bullets

<P>
remain in Tonya Moore's body and no surgery is planned at this time, said 
Randall Johnson, a lawyer and friend of the family who is serving as the 
Moores' spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"She has been coherent and able to speak with her family," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Demetria Moore and her two brothers, 10-year-old Donnie Jr. and 7-year-old 
Ronnie, are staying with friends, Johnson said. Initially, "the two boys were 
doing pretty good," Johnson said, "but they had a sleepless night." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Flying From Texas 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators had no additional information about the shootings this 
morning pending the release of Moore's autopsy results this afternoon, said 
Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of both Tonya and Donnie Moore are flying to Orange County today 
from their homes in Texas, Johnson said. Friends of the family, including 
people from the Angels organization and Demetria's high school classmates, have 
visited the hospital to offer assistance, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements for Donnie Moore, 35, are pending until the Moores' 
parents arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, everyone is not really sure what to do," Johnson said. "It would be 
easier if we had Tonya to make some decisions."

'STRICKEN' PILOT WAS SEEN MOVING IN PLANE

Military pilots who chased Thomas Root on his flight down the East Coast saw 
his head move back and forth several times during the 800-mile trip when he 
claimed to be unconscious, a federal investigator said today. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Alston, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board 
said military pilots also noticed changes in the position of the sun visor on 
the plane's windshield. 
</P>
<P>
And officials said a blood test screening for carbon monoxide in Root's blood 
system turned up negative, raising further questions about whether he fell 
unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
Root was confronted with the pilots' accounts this morning but was unable to 
explain the movement, Alston said. Root has maintained that he lost 
consciousness and traveled on autopilot before ditching in Bahamian waters last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"Various pilots reported that as he was intercepted from the right his head 
would turn to the right and as he was intercepted from the left, his head would 
move to the left," Alston said. "The sun visor moved position at least three 
times during the flight." 
</P>
<P>
Alston said any criminal investigation about the mystery flight would be 
handled by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Root, 36, remains in stable condition at Memorial Hospital in Hollywood with a 
gunshot wound to the abdomen. He has said that he doesn't know why he passed 
out during the flight and claimed that his .32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson 
revolver, kept in the plane's glove compartment, discharged during the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Bachmann, vice president of Smith &amp; Wesson, told the AP that the gun's 
safety features make such accidental firings impossible. "Suggestions that it 
could are absolutely false," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Witt, a veteran homicide investigator, told the AP there was "indisputable 
scientific proof" that Root's bullet wound was at least four hours old when he 
arrived at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's claim supported the findings of U.S. Coast Guard surgeon James Rahman, 
who has said that peritonitis -- or inflammation of the abdominal cavity -- 
showed Root must have been shot at least two hours before he was rescued. 
</P>
<P>
"All this would indicate that Mr. Root is being less than truthful," Witt said.

SENATE AIDE GETS PROBATION FOR SEX ATTACK

A former high-ranking Senate aide from Alabama pleaded guilty today to a charge 
of aggravated sexual battery on a 20-year-old Senate intern and was placed on 
probation with orders to get treatment for psycho-sexual disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit Court Judge William L. Winston sentenced Quentin C. Crommelin Jr. to 10 
years in prison, but the judge suspended the sentence, placing Crommelin on 
probation for five years and making mental therapy a special condition of the 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Crommelin, 42, a native of Wetumpka, Ala., was a top aide to conservative 
senators and was appointed Republican counsel for the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee in 1987 by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), a post Crommelin held until 
June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Force, Threat, Intimidation' 
</P>
<P>
He was accused of a sexual attack on the woman intern five months after he left 
the committee post. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Heitin, an Arlington County prosecutor, told the court today that the 
commonwealth of Virginia was prepared to prove that Crommelin had sexual 
contact with the woman by "force, threat and intimidation" in his Arlington 
apartment on Oct. 30, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Crommelin resigned in June, 1983, as a top aide to then-Sen. John East (R-N.C.) 
shortly after District of Columbia authorities decided not to prosecute him 
after an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Crommelin worked as an aide to the late U.S. Sen. Jim Allen, a 
conservative Alabama Democrat, and former Sen. Harry F. Byrd (I-Va.).

In addition to memorializing demonstrators who were killed by the Chinese army, 
said Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.), who sponsored the legislation, the action 
serves "to remind Beijing that America will never and can never forget the 
ruthlessness and callousness of the Chinese government in crushing their 
citizen-demonstrators and their aspirations." The amendment was added by voice 
vote to a bill authorizing State Department programs for the new budget year.

U.S. EXTRADITES KHASHOGGI TO FACE CHARGES OF AIDING MARCOS IN FRAUD

Adnan Khashoggi, once the world's richest arms dealer, was extradited from 
Switzerland to New York today to face charges that he helped ousted Philippines 
President Ferdinand E. Marcos in a massive fraud scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi, escorted by two police officers, flew first-class on a Swissair 
plane for New York three months after he was arrested in a Bern hotel on a U.S. 
warrant. The jet-setting Saudi Arabian dropped his efforts to avoid extradition 
when the Swiss said he could face only obstruction-of-justice and mail-fraud 
charges in the United States and not two more serious offenses -- racketeering 
and conspiracy. The obstruction-of-justice and mail-fraud charges carry maximum 
five-year jail terms versus 20-year prison sentences for the other charges. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they want Khashoggi, who was to be arraigned late this 
afternoon, to be denied bail on charges that he helped Marcos hide ownership of 
several Manhattan skyscrapers that the exiled Philippine leader allegedly 
bought with money looted from his country's treasury. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Justice Department said it had rejected the U.S. request that he be 
turned over to be tried on racketeering and conspiracy charges because the 
charges are not criminal offenses in Switzerland.

Aung San Suu Kyi, the leading opposition figure in Myanmar (formerly Burma), 
called off a planned march in the capital today, fearing bloodshed after the 
military government poured heavily armed troops into the city streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no intention of leading our people straight into a killing field," she 
said by telephone from the capital, Yangon (formerly Rangoon). 
</P>
<P>
At least 20 young people were arrested and many beaten in scattered clashes 
across the city as the government took drastic action to prevent any recurrence 
of the massive popular demonstrations that engulfed the capital last year. 
Western diplomats said today's operation appeared to herald a tightening of the 
screw on dissent in Myanmar after a relatively loose interpretation of 
martial-law rules in recent weeks.

A judge sentenced the mother of a junior high school student to 10 days in 
Baltimore's "dirty, funky, stinky " jail for allowing her daughter to miss 101 
days of school last year. 
</P>
<P>
After sentencing Debra Shaw to the maximum jail time Tuesday, District Judge 
David W. Young then instructed a jailer to give the woman's two children a tour 
of the courthouse holding cells. 
</P>
<P>
"Your mother is going to the dirty, funky, stinky Baltimore City Jail because 
the two of you have played hooky," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Young blamed their mother's laziness for the children's truancy, noting that 
she had failed to show up for several meetings with school officials before 
charges were filed.

A twin-engine plane caught fire shortly after takeoff today and crashed into a 
house near the airport, killing the pilot and a baby in the home and injuring 
six other residents.

four of their children suffered minor injuries. The body of 6-month-old Paul 
Beam was found in the rubble. 
</P>

Amoco Corp. today said it has signed an agreement with Egypt for oil 
exploration in four areas totaling 10,036 square miles, but denied reports of a 
joint venture with Atlantic Richfield Co. for Egyptian exploration. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no agreement with ARCO," said spokesman Greg Clock at Amoco's Chicago 
headquarters when asked about news reports of a $126.3-million agreement to 
explore jointly for oil and gas in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at ARCO's Los Angeles headquarters also could not confirm any joint 
agreement with Amoco. 
</P>
<P>
Exploration will be in four "concessions" -- the Sallum area of the western 
Sahara, the central Sinai region, and two in the Gulf of Suez, Clock said.

TIME'S 2ND-QUARTER INCOME UP 12% OVER SAME PERIOD IN '88

Time Inc.'s second-quarter net income rose 12% to $94 million, or $1.61 a 
share, compared to $84 million, or $1.45 a share, in the corresponding 1988 
period, the company reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which is battling to complete an offer to acquire Warner 
Communications Inc., valued at $14 billion, said increased second-quarter 
earnings reflected operating gains in its four divisions -- magazines, books, 
television programming and cable television -- and the inclusion of a 
$12-million pretax annual dividend from the company's investment in 
Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System. 
</P>
<P>
Time's performance, however, was off slightly for the first half of 1989 
because of first-quarter expenses relating to its business combination with 
Warner, a Time spokesman said. The company earned $143 million, or $2.49 a 
share, a 5% dip from $150 million, or $2.58 a share, in the first half of 1988.

Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp filed objections with the state insurance 
commissioner today to deny any exemptions to insurance companies who have filed 
for protection from price rollbacks mandated by Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp charged that insurance companies "are now trying to bury the 
initiative under literally tons of paper." About 6,000 applications have been 
filed by insurance companies seeking exemptions from the 20% rate rollbacks 
called for by the ballot initiative approved by voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp was joined by California Common Cause, Voter Revolt, Prop. 103 
Intervention Team, Consumers Union and the Center for Public Interest Law. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp also called upon Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie to adopt 
regulations that would eliminate "unreasonably high" overhead charges from 
consumer insurance rates, throw out "self-serving" projections on future 
payouts expected by insurance companies and deny insurers a profit on assets 
not being used to provide insurance.

South Korea Defense Minister Lee Sang Hoon pledged today to purchase U.S. 
fighter jets to upgrade his nation's defenses, and Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney said discussions will continue on that nation's proposal to co-produce 
the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The South Korean proposal to co-produce a U.S. fighter has raised concern among 
members of Congress that sensitive U.S. technology would be transferred to a 
nation that could then produce the planes on its own. 
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans have not yet decided whether to request the F-16, made by 
General Dynamics Corp., or the F-18, made by McDonnell Douglas Corp., Lee said. 
The South Koreans reportedly want to buy a dozen of the planes, assemble three 
dozen more from U.S.-supplied kits and then build about 72 on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the decision on which plane to purchase will be made at the end of 
August or the beginning of September. "I would like to make it very clear that 
we are going to purchase aircraft with sources in the United States," he said.

An agent for Pittsburgh Steelers running back Tim Worley said that because of 
stalled contract talks, the team's top draft pick will train in Los Angeles to 
sell insurance and may not train in Latrobe to play football. 
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to go the whole year if necessary and go into the draft again 
next year. I know a lot of teams would like to take him. They need running 
backs," agent Doc Daniels said Tuesday from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels is reportedly seeking a five-year, $9-million contract for the Georgia 
running back, the seventh player taken in the draft. The agent said the 
Steelers have offered $1.6 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not even in the same stadium," he said.

DRAVECKY MIGHT BE WELL ENOUGH TO START PITCHING

Dave Dravecky appears so well recovered from removal of a cancerous tumor in 
his left shoulder that he may resume pitching for the Giants as early as this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Giants Manager Roger Craig said the 34-year-old Dravecky is "just looking 
unbelievable. He's much further along than we could have hoped. He's remarkably 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
A team spokeswoman said today that a decision about when Dravecky will start 
pitching again is not certain, although it seems likely he will resume Sunday. 
That could be in a rehabilitation program either Class A San Jose or in 
Phoenix. The spokeswoman said the decision would be made after today's game 
against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
In a 100-pitch game simulation at Candlestick on Tuesday, the left-hander was 
clocked at a high of 85 m.p.h. and showed good control. Simulated games use 
mostly reserves and other pitchers for hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching Coach Norm Sherry said that Dravecky gave up five or six hits but that 
none was a homer. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw sinkers and some splits," he said. "His curve was better than any I 
had ever seen him throw. His slider was flat at times, but when you go through 
spring training, the slider is the last pitch to come around." 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky last started on May 28, 1988, in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seems to be falling into place," he said Tuesday. "I'm throwing 
more pitches, I'm feeling better with my rhythm and I'm improving my 
consistency in the strike zone. The last two innings, I tried to air it out and 
was pleased." 
</P>
<P>
He said he wants the level of his competition to be as close to the major 
leagues as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Craig said the team is interested in seeing how Dravecky throws, "if he throws 
without pain, and if he can come back after sitting on the bench for 20 minutes 
or so." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is not concerned about Dravecky's speed: "He's not a power pitcher. 
He uses his head."
