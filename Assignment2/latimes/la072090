FIRE DESTROYS HOLLYWOOD STUDIO;

Fire gutted a two-story Hollywood studio early Thursday, causing an estimated 
$2.6 million in damage to the 70-year-old building where the old "Steve Allen 
Show" was made. 
</P>
<P>
About 110 firefighters were called to the Late Night Studios in the 1200 block 
of Vine Street, where they battled flames which at one time threatened to 
engulf a nearby apartment house, Fire Department spokesman Pat Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began at 2:10 a.m. and was extinguished 90 minutes later, Marek said. 
There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Officials were investigating the cause of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Rik Sciacca, one of the owners of Late Night Studios, a 5-year-old 
entertainment production company, said he was told faulty electrical wires 
sparked the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing left," Sciacca, who lived in a studio office, said Thursday 
morning as he collected the few items that were not devoured by the flames. 
Sciacca said nearly everything he owns has been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
'I don't know when I'm going to cry," Sciacca told a friend. "I have no pants, 
shoes or shirts. I'm still a little shaken up. I left here at 12:15 a.m. and 
came back later and watched the place burn." 
</P>
<P>
Late Night Studios is involved in, among other enterprises, the production of 
music videos. 
</P>
<P>
The structure, built in the 1920s, once was home to the Filmarte Theatre Movie 
House, said Hollywood historian Marc Wanamaker. 
</P>
<P>
Wanamaker said the theater was transformed into a television audience theater 
in the early 1960s. Among programs produced there was the "Steve Allen Show." 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimated that the fire caused $1.6 million in damage to the 
structure and another $1 million to its contents, which included sound stages, 
a rehearsal room, offices and wardrobe rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Two other companies rented space in the building, Sciacca said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the fire, city officials closed Vine Street and several nearby roads 
for five hours Thursday.

NOT ALL THE BUS RIDERS ARE SOLD ON TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each weekday morning, private nurse Remedios D. Catbagan boards an RTD bus in 
downtown Long Beach and steps off in downtown Los Angeles. It is a routine she 
has kept day in, day out for nearly five years. Then she decided to try out the 
sleek new $877-million Metro Rail Blue Line train. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment lasted exactly one trip. 
</P>
<P>
"One time only!" an emphatic Catbagan said Thursday, back in her regular seat 
aboard the RTD's Bus 456. "Oh, my God, I will not do it any more. This is the 
way. If you want to reach downtown, you ride 456." 
</P>
<P>
Catbagan blames the Blue Line for getting her to work 45 minutes late, due in 
part to time she spent waiting to transfer to a bus. Now, she is back among the 
die-hards, the inveterate bus riders who look askance at Metro Rail, who see it 
as an unproven technology, a thing with possibilities, perhaps, if all the 
difficulties get worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard horror stories," said Margaret Everitt, another commuter on Bus 
456, who said she might give the Blue Line a try when the crowds die down. 
"I've heard about things like (train) delays in the afternoon. I don't have 
that kind of time. To me (the trip downtown) is not a pleasure ride -- it's a 
necessity." 
</P>
<P>
Riders on Bus 456 -- known officially as the Long Beach Freeway Express -- 
travel busing's equivalent of the Blue Line route. The bus starts near the 
south end of the 19-mile, 55-minute train route and actually goes further into 
downtown Los Angeles, all the way to Bunker Hill. The trip is more expensive: 
$2.30 one-way, compared to $1.10 for the Blue Line once the trains begin 
charging fares next month. But it is also 10 minutes faster, depending on the 
freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
To bus driver Jim Padilla, who has spent 15 years on the route, "There is no 
comparison. There is nothing wrong with the Blue Line -- I'm glad they have it 
-- but this will go downtown much quicker. It's one of the sweetest lines there 
is." 
</P>
<P>
The route has been well-traveled for years. Ridership on Route 456 is more than 
2,000 passengers a day and has been for more than a decade. RTD officials say 
they are going to closely watch that ridership in the future to determine 
whether the express route should be kept now that the Blue Line is in place, 
spokesman Greg Davy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have (ridership) checkers on the buses this week," Davy said. "(But) 
we will be monitoring that line over the next year or so. If it's clear nobody 
is riding the bus any more, we will cancel the line. But if people keep using 
it, then we'll keep it." 
</P>
<P>
So far, at least, the 456 has retained most of its strong following, according 
to Padilla. Early morning buses have been nearly full, he said, and his own 
8:30 a.m. bus contained about 15 passengers catching the end of the morning 
rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
Passenger Clark Paul, 40, was on his way to work as bar manager of the downtown 
Sonora Cafe. Paul is one of those rare commuters who has found the ideal 
arrangement: The bus picks him up just a block from his apartment on the 
oceanfront and drops him off just a block from work. Along the way, he sips a 
little coffee -- "Most of the drivers don't seem to mind" -- and reads the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
He also clips his Sony Walkman to the rail of the window so he can listen to 
rock music on headphones. A rolling picture of serenity, he wouldn't give it up 
if the Blue Line were the last train to Clarksville. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get any better than this," Paul said. "And for $2.30, you really 
can't beat it." 
</P>
<P>
Not that he is dead-set against rail travel: "I'll probably give it a go 
(eventually)," Paul allowed. "But to me, it's still too much an oddity and a 
novelty. I have no qualms about taking the bus." 
</P>
<P>
Willis King, 37, a nursing assistant at the Veterans Administration Hospital in 
Long Beach, was traveling to pick up new eyeglasses at the Beverly Center. He 
wouldn't mind taking the train, he said, except that it doesn't run near the 
Bixby Knolls area of Long Beach where he lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely going to try it. I just haven't had the time," he said. "For 
me, the bus is convenient (and) it's on time." 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Jameil, 24, who works for a development firm in Los Angeles, has found 
that Bus 456 drops her just a block from work, a fact that didn't keep her from 
taking the Blue Line home three days this week. 
</P>
<P>
On one of those trips, she said, the train doors stuck and she was delayed for 
90 minutes downtown. On another trip, a car ran into her train near the 
Florence Avenue stop, giving passengers a jolt and disabling the train. She and 
a crowd of passengers had to switch trains before proceeding homeward. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd try it out," Jameil said, "but I haven't been getting home till 
7 or 8 (at night). I think I'll let them work the bugs out."

SOURCE OF JULIAN WATER CONTAMINATION STILL A MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BONNA M. DE LA CRUZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost a year has gone by since Scott Monroe, owner of Bailey's Wood Pit 
Barbecue in Julian, was drilling for water and came up with gas instead. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the mountain community's wells have been tested, and traces of 
benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, have been found in three of its nine wells. 
Officials believe the benzene, a component of gasoline, leaked from an 
underground fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
Although many residents say the contaminated wells have not hurt tourism and 
the local water is now safe to drink, the mystery of how the supply went bad 
remains unsolved. Monroe, meanwhile -- a 12-year resident of the community -- 
is stuck with a $6,500 well full of contaminated water. 
</P>
<P>
"The town's running out of water, and I'm really hot about this," he said. "I 
have water in my well, but I can't use it because it's contaminated." 
</P>
<P>
Health and water officials say they still don't know how long the water has 
been tainted or whether the leak is continuing. Harry Seifert, general manager 
of the Julian Community Services District, which distributes the water, 
estimates the contamination can be traced back at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chevron U.S.A. installed a $42,000 carbon filter to purify the water 
soon after the contamination was discovered last fall, the company is uncertain 
how long residents may have been drinking bad water, Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Chevron -- one of several oil companies that have operated 
near the site of the town's underground fuel tanks -- has spent more than 
$120,000 on Julian's water problems. It has been conducting weekly tests to 
determine the extent of the leak, and it also imported 320,000 gallons of water 
into the district last September while the carbon filter was being installed -- 
all free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron has agreed to continue pouring money into the project, despite the fact 
that there has been no conclusion that the contamination came from one of its 
tanks, or even from a tank belonging to other Julian gas stations. Company 
officials emphasize that they have not been found responsible, but say there is 
always the possibility Chevron was involved. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company closed down its service station at the corner of Main 
Street and Washington last month. Chevron officials said the shutdown is not 
connected to the contamination, and that the station was closed simply because 
it was not a profit-maker. That leaves one gas station in town, although during 
the past 40 years there have been as many as five at once. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to tell where the stuff came from," Seifert said, noting that all 
five stations were within a two-block area in town, which is just four blocks 
long and three blocks wide. 
</P>
<P>
"Chevron stepped in when there was no proof of anyone's responsibility," he 
said. "They stepped to the front as far as taking care of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Seifert speculated that the company may be motivated by memories of another 
leak during the late 1970s in which a Chevron tank briefly contaminated a town 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"The (contamination) traces are old enough so that we can't exactly trace it," 
he said of the current problem. "There is no evidence that points to one 
specific source of contamination." 
</P>
<P>
Kim Wiseman, an environmental engineer with Chevron, said the company, which 
has operated a service station in the heart of Julian for more than a dozen 
years, took on the chore simply as a civic duty at a time when Julian was 
facing a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman said that, once the source of the leak is found, the company will "seek 
compensation for funds that have been spent thus far from the responsible 
party." 
</P>
<P>
Although Chevron continues to absorb the cost of the cleanup, residents say 
it's been business as usual in Julian, a rustic community famous for its 
apples, apple pie and apple-buying tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The town prides itself on remaining in a time warp of the early 1900s, a place 
where folks can get away from the smog and traffic of big-city life and enjoy 
green mountains and dirt trails. 
</P>
<P>
But local officials worry that its reputation is becoming somewhat tarnished 
and that the town is being jokingly referred to as the "Julian Valdez" -- a 
reference to the giant Exxon tanker responsible for the worst oil spill in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of testing, water and health officials are still searching for the 
source of the leak and the best way to deal with the contamination. Seifert 
said the water district has hired an attorney to handle any litigation that 
might arise. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows how long the water's been contaminated?" said Julian resident Joe 
Romano, a member of the water district board. "What matters is that millions of 
gallons of water were poisoned. It may take us 20 years to recover, if ever." 
</P>
<P>
Romano complained that Chevron is positioning itself as "the rescuers, not the 
perpetrators." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Avera, deputy director of San Diego County's environmental health services 
department, said Julian's problem is considered severe because the community 
depends totally on underground water. It is one of the few areas in the county 
that doesn't import water. 
</P>
<P>
However, Avera said the health hazards posed by the benzene are minimal. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of benzene is just over the acceptable levels, but just barely," he 
said. No reports of health problems have been sent to the health department 
yet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in Julian, as in the rest of the state, are facing a fourth year of 
drought, and they say they are more concerned about that shortage than about 
the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe posted a sign outside his barbecue restaurant: "Due to the water 
shortage, we are serving all dinners on paper or plastic. Sorry for the 
inconvenience." Other businesses in town are also taking measures to cut down 
on water use, including installing portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
Because Julian's shortage is compounded by the contamination, water officials 
have placed a moratorium on water hookups and in the heart of the community. 
</P>
<P>
The water district serves about 500 people within a 5-square-mile area, Seifert 
said. The district uses about 50,000 gallons a day, more on weekends because of 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert said district customers have cut consumption 30% in the first six 
months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron installed the temporary filtration system a week after the tainted 
water was discovered, Wiseman said, "simply to get a drinking water supply 
system on line while investigations are going on." 
</P>
<P>
A more sophisticated and efficient machine, estimated to cost more than 
$100,000, is being designed and built by Chevron to replace the carbon filter, 
it is hoped within the next nine months, Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is for Julian to have a safe drinking water supply," Wiseman said. 
</P>
<P>
According to James Silver, owner of the lot where the Chevron station stood, a 
gas station has stood on the spot since 1914, when gasoline was pumped from 
wooden barrels. Before then, a saloon occupied the property. The prime lot is 
now bare of buildings, and Silver said he is unsure about the fate of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
When the benzene was first detected, Chevron delivered 4,500 gallons of bottled 
water to the community and trucked in 315,000 gallons from Palomar Mountain 
that was pumped into the district's tanks. The company footed the $35,000 bill 
and distributed the water free, said Jane Fruin, a supervisor of environmental 
engineering at Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
Before the filter was installed, residents were warned by health and water 
officials about the contamination and were advised to drink only bottled water, 
Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked with gasoline all these years, I've drunk it, I've smelled the 
fumes, and it hasn't killed me yet," said Norm Cozens, owner of the six-pump 
Alliance Gasoline, now the lone station in town.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: LAWYER'S DEFENSE OF BITING NOVEL: THAT'S 
ENTERTAINMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So what does a hard-charging defense attorney who specializes in notorious 
clients and lost causes do in his spare time? 
</P>
<P>
Writes a satiric novel about a hard-charging defense attorney who specializes 
in notorious clients and lost causes, naturally. 
</P>
<P>
Enter now "Wilkes: His Life and Crimes" (Ballantine paperback, 352 pages), by 
Winston Schoonover, the nom de plume of noted San Diego defense attorney 
Charles Sevilla. 
</P>
<P>
It's what Sevilla has been doing when he's not trying to save Robert Alton 
Harris from the gas chamber or Roger Hedgecock from the honor camp at Descanso. 
</P>
<P>
"Wilkes" is a wicked and comic sendup of the overheated justice system. No one 
escapes. 
</P>
<P>
Not defense attorneys (maniacs), reporters (flacks for the prosecution), the 
U.S. attorney ("the Useless Attorney"), cops (liars), psychiatrists (highly 
paid liars) or probation officers ("court-designated hit men"). 
</P>
<P>
Judges ("black-robed pimps in the whorehouse of justice") get it the worst. 
</P>
<P>
The book's anti-hero, John Wilkes, defender of point shavers, murderers and 
lunatic bank robbers, thinks most judges are frustrated prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
One judge babbles in Latin. Another is heartbroken that he's never gotten to 
sentence someone to die. 
</P>
<P>
Most judges never saw a search warrant they didn't like or a criminal defendant 
they did. A lady judge has a name that is a pun on female anatomy. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkes to clients: "Will I defend you? I'll defend you to your very last cent." 
</P>
<P>
His clients get depressed: "If they had any morals, they'd be demoralized." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't apologize for his high fees: "If you've got cancer, you don't go to 
a free clinic." 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for thinly disguised San Diego characters. The book's set in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sevilla, 45, is prepared if some locals miss the humor. 
</P>
<P>
"The book was written for entertainment," he said. "If people read it in that 
fashion, I think they'll realize it is somewhat tongue-in-cheek. 
</P>
<P>
"If not, tough." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irish Eyes Are Watching 
</P>
<P>
Here today, here tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
* Tonight's American Ireland Fund Committee black-tie dinner at the San Diego 
Marriott will honor the Rev. Edward Malloy, president of the University of 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
The evening also will be dedicated to slain attorney Daniel Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
And funds raised will help rebuild St. John's Square in Listowel, Ireland, the 
Broderick ancestral home. 
</P>
<P>
There's a downside: Marriott security has been alerted to watch for crashers 
who may try to stage a demonstration in favor of Broderick's accused killer, 
ex-wife Betty. 
</P>
<P>
* Let's see if I have this straight. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Aguirre, beaten by Bob Filner for City Council in 1987, files a lawsuit 
that would force "pro-Latino" redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
Not so coincidentally, the Aguirre suit would make Filner's reelection much 
more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Glaser, beaten by Bruce Henderson for City Council in 1987, co-authors a 
redistricting map (counter to the Aguirre plan) that would force large-scale 
"pro-environment" shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Not so coincidentally, the Glaser map would make Henderson's reelection much 
more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, San Diego politics: where it's never over, even after it's over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Take Your Sunscreen 
</P>
<P>
It says here. 
</P>
<P>
* The naked truth. 
</P>
<P>
The Camping Bares, a San Diego family nudist group, has an active social 
schedule, including a dance (Boogie-in-the-Buff) and river trip (Canuding). 
</P>
<P>
Still, nudism is usually greeted with disapproving glances. Camping Bares 
accepts this. 
</P>
<P>
On its letterhead the group is described thusly: "An anarchist disorganization 
dedicated to the destruction of the fabric of our society."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARK SERVICE CRITICIZED OVER HOPE LAND DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Park Service's handling of a proposed exchange of public land for 
property owned by entertainer Bob Hope in Los Angeles and Ventura counties was 
severely criticized during a congressional hearing in Washington on Thursday, 
but the session was not expected to dampen the exchange's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Park Service Director James M. Ridenour said his agency has not taken a 
position on trading 59 acres it owns in Cheeseboro Canyon for 1,100 acres of 
Hope property on the adjacent Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Hope also has agreed to transfer another 4,600 acres of his holdings in the 
Santa Monica and Santa Susana Mountains to parks agencies for a below-market 
price of $10 million if the land-swap is approved. 
</P>
<P>
Political machinations, confusion and ambiguity have marked the Park Service's 
handling of the Jordan Ranch swap, said Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.). "This 
process stinks," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FEUDING LAWYERS GET EARFUL FROM ANGRY JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge on Thursday lashed out at two Encino lawyers for using the legal system 
to fight a neighborhood dispute that began in one attorney's back yard 
basketball court and escalated to a full-blown Superior Court battle. 
</P>
<P>
"You have by your conduct and by your positions as lawyers embarrassed the bar 
and the judicial system as a whole," Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Marvin D. 
Rowen told attorneys Michael Rubin and Kenneth Schild. "You have subjected the 
whole system to ridicule." 
</P>
<P>
Rowen granted a request for an extension of a temporary restraining order 
sought by Rubin to restrict the times during which the Schild family could use 
the basketball court.

THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three more suspected manhole cover thieves were arrested by Los Angeles police 
Thursday when they arrived with a truckload of the lifted lids at the same 
downtown salvage yard where two men were caught the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the suspects are part of a ring that stole several hundred 
municipal and utility manhole covers, catch basin lids and storm drain grates 
during the past two weeks. Booked for investigation of receiving stolen 
property were Los Angeles residents Julian Miguel Ruiz, 25; Rual Hernandez, 25; 
and Luis Vallecillo, 25. 
</P>
<P>
They were arrested, police said, after arriving at the Downtown Metal Center in 
an old pickup truck to sell four of the 200-pound discs.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MEINERS OAKS; 
</P>
<P>
COURT CONSIDERS DEVELOPMENT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appeals court heard arguments Wednesday in a test case that may 
determine the future of housing development in the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, held in the county supervisors' boardroom, a three-judge panel 
weighed arguments in the case that pits a developer's effort to build homes 
against the county's right to limit new housing in areas suffering from traffic 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The county is appealing a Superior Court decision last May ordering county 
officials to consider the application of the developer, Franciscan-Lowe, to 
build 50 houses on a 25-acre parcel in Meiners Oaks as would have been 
permitted under the county's old general plan. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, the supervisors adopted a new general plan, banning any new 
subdivisions in the Ojai Valley that would increase traffic congestion on 
California 33 through Casitas Springs. 
</P>
<P>
John Schuck of Santa Barbara, head of the Franciscan-Lowe project, filed suit 
later that year. He successfully contended that the project should fall under 
the old plan because the county was reviewing his subdivision plans in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But the county argues that Schuck's application was not deemed complete until 
after the supervisors had given notice of their intent to limit new 
subdivisions, said Assistant County Counsel Andrew B. Gustafson. 
</P>
<P>
The court of appeals is not expected to make a decision for at least three 
weeks, Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 11 other subdivision applications to build 125 more homes in Ojai 
Valley are awaiting the outcome of Schuck's lawsuit. "If he wins, they could 
all be processed under the old plan," Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
But if the county wins, Gustafson said, there is a chance the county could be 
sued for taking away property rights from a developer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the county's Planning Division is continuing to process Schuck's 
application as required by the Superior Court ruling. Earlier this month, 
county planners released a third version of a draft environmental impact report 
for the controversial project. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Environmental Report Review Committee is scheduled to hold a 
public hearing on the draft report on Aug. 22 at the Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens group had challenged the last two drafts of the environmental impact 
report, saying that they did not adequately address the tract's potential 
impact on traffic congestion and wildlife in the area. The same group submitted 
a petition to the supervisors in January with 1,376 signatures of area 
residents opposed to the project. THIA BELL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT IN BLUDGEONING MURDER IS FOUND DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected in the bludgeon-and-slashing death of his former girlfriend and 
the brief disappearance of their daughter was found dead, his arm cut at an 
artery, authorities said Thursday. Richard R. Mowery, 24, of Colton was found 
dead Wednesday about 4:23 p.m. on the old railroad right-of-way in the 1000 
block of Valley Drive in Hermosa Beach, police spokesman Phil Lonzello said. 
</P>
<P>
He had been wanted by Colton police in the slaying last Saturday of his 
ex-girlfriend, Crystal Robinson, 27, at her mobile home in a park on Reche 
Canyon Road, police said. Witnesses said Mowery was seen that day taking his 
and Robinson's 1-year-old daughter Sarah from the mobile home, Colton police 
spokeswoman Misty King said. The baby was found alive Tuesday at a Redondo 
Beach motel, her skull fractured in five places, Hermosa Beach police said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AUTOPSY SHOWS KIDNAPED BOY WAS SUFFOCATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An autopsy has found that an 11-year-old Inglewood boy who was kidnaped on his 
way home from school in late May was suffocated, a coroner's spokesman said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Bob Dambacher said the death of William Tillett, a fourth-grader at 
Bennett-Kew Elementary School, was listed as a homicide and the cause as 
asphyxia. 
</P>
<P>
William's body was discovered behind a Hawthorne apartment building on May 24, 
several hours after his parents reported to police that he had not returned 
home from school. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there were indications that William had been bound but no signs of 
life-threatening trauma. An earlier autopsy was inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation into William's death is continuing, police said. No arrests 
have been made.

GOOD SAMARITAN'S CONDITION 'STABLE' AS HIS NEIGHBORS RAISE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
While the man police call a good Samaritan lay in a hospital bed fighting for 
his life Thursday, his wife described him as someone who often helped people in 
need without fear for his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
"He just cares about people," Sandra Smith said of her husband, Gary, a 
part-time carpet layer and paralegal. "He doesn't want to see people get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Smith was shot four times after he responded to a University City woman's 
screams for help by chasing a man who had just burglarized the woman's home. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Smith was laying carpet in a building next to the woman's home in the 7900 
block of Camino Tranquilo when he heard screams and confronted a gun-wielding 
man about a block away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla operated on Gary Smith several 
times Thursday, treating bullet wounds in his face, stomach, left leg and left 
arm, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is in stable condition," hospital spokeswoman Dilene Pulsipher said late 
Thursday afternoon after one of the operations. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's encounter with the burglar wasn't his first attempt at helping a crime 
victim, his wife told reporters. Last Sunday, the 35-year-old San Diegan, who 
aspires to become a corporate lawyer, unsuccessfully gave chase to a purse 
snatcher, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Smith never stopped to think that he might get hurt while aiding others, 
his wife said. Now others in the community are taking steps to help him. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the San Diego Police Officers Assn. announced Thursday that they 
will donate blood to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an emotional issue for us, too," said police Officer Robert Chorny, who 
attended a press conference with Sandra Smith at the hospital. "We've basically 
dubbed this guy 'the good Samaritan.' " 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the neighborhood where the shooting occurred are raising funds for 
Smith's medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to make a private donation," Pulsipher said. "They wanted to do 
it away from the media." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials requested that anyone wishing to donate money to the Smiths 
write to: Foundation for Gary Smith, Scripps Memorial Hospital, P.O. Box 28, La 
Jolla, CA, 92038. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police are still looking for a suspect in the case. Chorny said 
investigators have several leads, including a report that someone had tried to 
use one of the credit cards stolen during the burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the assailant as a young white man, about 5-foot-9 and 140 
pounds, with a light complexion and long, thin, brown hair. The man, described 
as clean-shaven but with an unkempt appearance, was last seen wearing a gray or 
blue Windbreaker and a pair of old jeans.

BERMAN ATTACKS LOCKHEED FOR LAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: THE REPRESENTATIVE SAYS THAT THE COMPANY SHOWED WORKERS 'THE BACK OF 
ITS HAND' AS HE TESTIFIED FOR A JOBLESS BENEFITS BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) blasted Lockheed Corp. Thursday for 
showing "bad faith" in dealing with the 6,000 employees who are expected to 
lose their jobs when the aerospace company pulls much of its operation out of 
Burbank by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"An enormous part of Lockheed's success in Southern California has come from 
the ingenuity, dedication and loyalty of the women and men who have worked for 
the company, some for 20, 30 or even 40 years, and have stood by it in times of 
trouble," Berman told the House Armed Services Committee on Investigations in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"For their loyalty, Lockheed is showing workers the back of its hand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Berman was testifying on behalf of a bill that would provide benefits -- 
including job training and relocation expenses -- for employees of defense 
contractors put out of work by recent military cutbacks. He called on Lockheed 
to implement programs of its own that would ease the impact of its departure on 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed announced May 8 that it was pulling much of its operation out of 
Burbank by the mid-1990s to move to newer facilities in Palmdale and Marietta, 
Ga. Nearly 6,000 workers are expected to lose their jobs, either through 
layoffs or early retirement. Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale said many of the 
buildings at its 320-acre Burbank facility were built as temporary structures 
during World War II and some date back to 1928, when Lockheed first located 
near what is now Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"As a minimum, the company should be offering right of first hire at new 
facilities, extending health benefits so families do not suffer and ensuring 
that retirement benefits remain intact for those laid off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Berman added that the departure of the company was particularly traumatic 
because many of the Lockheed employees who are being laid off moved last year 
from Los Angeles to Palmdale after the company announced it would move most of 
its operation there. 
</P>
<P>
He said that no program cancellation by the federal government had forced 
Lockheed to scale back its operations. 
</P>
<P>
"What is beyond doubt is that the decision to move was made in a climate of 
mismanagement and bad faith negotiation with the workers," Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesmen defended the company's existing programs for laid-off 
employees and said the current layoffs are the result of a slowdown in the 
aerospace industry, not the result of mismanagement, as charged by Berman. 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply not true that the layoffs that are occurring throughout the 
aerospace industry are the result of companies deciding that its a good idea to 
lay people off. They are occurring because of very pronounced changes that are 
taking place in the field of defense contracting," Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Lockheed's case, the layoffs are happening because the business base is 
declining and not for any other reason," Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed already offers right of first hire to laid-off employees, but the 
policy is complicated by several contracts with unions in different divisions 
of the company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Answering Berman's call for extended health insurance, Ragsdale said Lockheed 
currently pays a month's coverage after an employee is laid off and offers 
group insurance rates for another 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"We are complying with federal law, and going beyond it in many cases," 
Lockheed spokesman Ross B. Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement of the layoffs, government officials and labor leaders 
have sought to soften the economic blow of the company's departure. The Los 
Angeles City Council, for example, will meet in the San Fernando Valley next 
month to study the economic impact of the pullout and consider programs to deal 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the union that represents many of Lockheed's workers in Burbank, 
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, could not be 
reached for comment on Berman's testimony.

FUTURISTIC, HIGH-SPEED L.A.-PALMDALE TRAIN CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A private partnership is considering submitting a bid to build a 280 m.p.h. 
magnetic-levitation train system from Los Angeles International Airport through 
the San Fernando Valley to Palmdale, serving commuters, airport-bound travelers 
and gamblers headed to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The futuristic line, which would be built along the San Diego, Golden State and 
Antelope Valley freeways, was endorsed Thursday by Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley press spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor views the proposed line as 
a "means to allow thousands and thousands of commuters on the congested 405 and 
14 freeways to utilize rail transit." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also could save the city's long-shot bid to be connected to a 
proposed Las Vegas-to-Anaheim magnetic-levitation system, said Clifton Moore, 
general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
"This sounds like what we have been waiting for -- a way to open up Palmdale 
Airport," Moore said, adding that he will urge the city Board of Aiport 
Commissioners to endorse the plan at its meeting Wednesday because it offers 
long-sought relief for congestion at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
But submission of the proposal, which faces formidable financial, technological 
and political hurdles, is "far from a sure thing," said a top executive at 
Perini Corp., the Framingham, Mass.-based construction firm that heads the 
consortium studying whether to submit a bid for a 65-mile LAX-to-Palmdale line. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was developed in response to a state program to encourage private 
construction of transportation facilities approved by the Legislature last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators authorized the state Department of Transportation to select up to 
four projects in which commercial firms would build and operate highways, 
tunnels, bridges or rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, which will provide the right of way without charge, will own the 
projects but the firms building them will lease back the facilities for up to 
35 years and will keep all tolls or fees. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Caltrans selected nine companies and partnerships it deemed 
qualified to make bids. The selections included Perini and several other major 
construction firms. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals are due Aug. 1 and Caltrans expects to select the top four candidates 
by Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Cygan, Perini's manager of product development, said Thursday that the 
consortium is "withholding a decision to submit or not submit until the last 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
He said no ridership studies have been completed. But he said his firm has 
concluded that "three types of riders would use the line in significant 
numbers." These were identified as work-bound commuters, those headed to LAX or 
Palmdale Airport and those transferring flights from one airport to another, 
and travelers to and from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Las Vegas passengers would transfer in Palmdale to trains on the 41-mile 
Victor Valley-to-Palmdale spur off the proposed 265-mile Las Vegas-to-Anaheim 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel Corp. heads a consortium that on Monday proposed building a $5-billion 
magnetic-levitation line between the gambling mecca and Orange County that 
would largely follow the right of way of Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is being evaluated by the California-Nevada Super Speed Train 
Commission. The commission was created by the legislatures in the two states to 
stimulate construction by a private firm of such a line by offering the right 
of way without charge. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials, including Bradley, expressed disappointment the Bechtel 
proposal gave a low priority to the Palmdale spur, which they view as the key 
to expanded use of Palmdale Airport. 
</P>
<P>
At speeds up to 280 m.p.h., the Las Vegas-Anaheim trip would take little more 
than an hour, Bechtel officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel envisions using magnetic-levitation technology now being tested on a 
20-mile track in West Germany. That technology, however, has not entered 
commercial service. 
</P>
<P>
Magnetic-levitation systems use a magnetic field to propel trains forward and 
to elevate them one to four inches above an elevated guideway. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel officials say a magnetic-levitation train at 250 m.p.h. generates less 
noise than a single automobile at freeway speed. 
</P>
<P>
Perini's Cygan said his firm and partners Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; 
Mendenhall have not decided whether to use German or Japanese 
magnetic-levitation technology, but that they "have pretty much ruled out 
monorail, light-rail and heavy rail. Those just don't have the speed or 
environmental benefits of mag-lev."

SCHOOLS PANEL URGES ROOM AIR CONDITIONERS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: IN THE EFFORT TO COOL YEAR-ROUND CLASSROOMS, WINDOW UNITS ARE 
CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MORE EXPENSIVE CENTRAL COOLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Los Angeles school board committee recommended Thursday installing window air 
conditioners at a handful of San Fernando Valley schools to see if the units 
will provide a low-cost alternative to central air-conditioning, which would 
cost an estimated $675 million to install at campuses citywide. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot program -- which must be approved by the full school board -- could 
reduce air-conditioning costs by more than two-thirds, said Julie Crum, 
assistant director of maintenance for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate that it will cost about $90 million to install central 
air-conditioning at 61 year-round schools in the Valley, the area identified as 
having the highest temperatures in the city. Installing window air conditioners 
would cost an estimated $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether the window units will be too noisy and whether they 
can cool off a room with 30 warm bodies," Crum said. 
</P>
<P>
The school board's building committee also agreed to apply for $30 million of 
the $45 million in state bond money approved by voters in June to pay for 
air-conditioning year-round schools. 
</P>
<P>
Parents representing schools in the Valley told building committee members that 
classrooms this past month have been too hot for their children to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"It is terrible for the kids," agreed school board member Julie Korenstein, who 
represents the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said it will take several years to install central 
air-conditioning at the more than 475 schools that will need such systems when 
the entire district converts to year-round scheduling next summer. 
</P>
<P>
The year-round schedules were approved by the board earlier this year to make 
more classroom space available in the fast-growing district. 
</P>
<P>
Some board members have suggested the district raise funds for air-conditioning 
and other improvements through a local bond measure in the next two years. A 
similar measure was narrowly defeated by Beverly Hills voters in June.

JUDGE SCOLDS BOTH LAWYERS INVOLVED IN NOISE DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A judge on Thursday lashed out at two Encino lawyers for using the legal system 
to fight a neighborhood dispute that began in one attorney's back-yard 
basketball court and escalated to a full-blown Superior Court battle. 
</P>
<P>
"You have by your conduct and by your positions as lawyers embarrassed the bar 
and the judicial system as a whole," Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Marvin D. 
Rowen told attorneys Michael P. Rubin and Kenneth R. Schild, who quietly 
endured the judge's withering gaze. 
</P>
<P>
"You have subjected the whole system to ridicule and to public scorn and many 
people and your fellow practitioners . . . would find this kind of conduct 
intolerable," Rowen said. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, the Encino neighbors have been locked in legal combat 
over Rubin's contention that Schild and his children make too much noise 
playing basketball near Rubin's bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys have filed a flurry of suits, countersuits and restraining order 
requests and videotaped each other in an attempt to gather evidence to be used 
in court. On at least one occasion Rubin sprayed Schild and his son with a 
garden hose to stop them from playing. 
</P>
<P>
Rowen's scathing comments came after he granted a request for a restraining 
order sought by Rubin to restrict the Schild family's use of the basketball 
court. Rowen ruled that the Schilds may play only between the hours of 10 a.m. 
and noon, 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. and 7:30 and 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rowen's order extends for up to three years a temporary restraining order 
issued by Van Nuys Superior Court Commissioner David Nisall on June 6. The 
legal battle, meanwhile, will continue. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, 36, a North Hollywood personal injury lawyer who is serving as his own 
attorney in the case, said "the judge is expressing what a lot of people -- a 
lot of attorneys and judges -- feel about this case." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "I feel that I have no other alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Schild, a 47-year-old partner with Century City-based Irell &amp; Manella, one 
of the largest law firms in Los Angeles, refused to comment on the judge's 
statements. Richard DeBodo, one of two attorneys from Schild's firm who 
represented him in court, also declined to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Schild's wife and children, ages 11 and 13, came to court but did not speak. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin's lawsuit against Schild seeks more than $2 million in assorted damages 
for injuries to Rubin's "health, strength and activity." Schild's lawsuit seeks 
general damages. He has said in the past that he filed it to protect his 
children's right to play safely in their own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin has claimed that the noise from the basketball playing has disturbed his 
naps, kept his wife awake while she was pregnant and reduced the value of his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The Schilds claim that the Rubins have harassed them by playing loud rock music 
and by videotaping their games. 
</P>
<P>
Both attorneys claim that attempts to settle out of court have failed because 
the other made unreasonable demands.

3 CHARGED IN SLAYING OF SWAP MEET GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Roland (Lucky) Teal used to preach on Sundays to the wards at Sylmar Juvenile 
Hall. Now a youth arrested in his slaying is being held there. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Pacoima boy was among three suspects charged Thursday with 
murdering Teal, a popular security guard at the San Fernando Swap Meet. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities allege that the juvenile, along with Ricardo Roldan, 19, of 
Pacoima, and Richard Zorns, 19, of Arleta, took part in a June 3 robbery at the 
swap meet during which Teal, 61, who was unarmed, was shot in the back when he 
tried to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
Each suspect was charged with murder, attempted murder and robbery. Roldan and 
Zorns are being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman said he will attempt to 
have the 17-year-old tried as an adult and will ask for the death penalty for 
Roldan, who allegedly fired the Uzi-style assault weapon that killed Teal. 
</P>
<P>
Teal, of Pacoima, had 15 children and stepchildren. Nine of them, ranging in 
age from 3 to 16, were still living at home at the time of his death. He worked 
several jobs to support his family. 
</P>
<P>
Police allege that Roldan and the juvenile suspect robbed the swap meet's 
manager, Barnie Pipkin, 68, as he stepped out of his office with bags 
containing $12,000 in receipts he planned to deposit at a bank. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers fired a shot at Pipkin but missed, and then fled to a nearby car 
believed driven by Zorns, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Teal jumped in his van and chased the car, cutting it off on nearby Borden 
Street. When the juvenile allegedly attempted to run away with the money bags, 
Teal grabbed him. Roldan then allegedly came up behind Teal and shot him in the 
back, police said.

HUSBANDS ARE BEING HELD AT GUNPOINT, CALLER TELLS WOMEN; 
</P>
<P>
TERROR: MYSTERY MAN HAS MADE AT LEAST 42 SUCH CALLS TO HOMES OF SAN GABRIEL 
VALLEY COUPLES LISTED IN PHONE BOOKS. HE TELLS WIVES HE HAS ABDUCTED THE MEN 
FOR RANSOM.

<P>
A mysterious telephone caller has harassed at least 42 San Gabriel Valley women 
since April with phone calls in which he claims to be holding their husbands 
hostage at gunpoint, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
No husbands have actually been held hostage and no one has been physically 
injured. But the calls can be a terrifying experience, one of the victims said. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina Detective Dennis Edwards said police believe that one man may be 
responsible because of the similar nature of the calls. He said the caller 
apparently selects as his targets people who are listed as a couple in the 
phone book. 
</P>
<P>
All of the victims have been listed in the telephone directory, said Lt. Phil 
Bollington of the Temple City substation of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the victims are from Pasadena, 12 from Monrovia, eight from West 
Covina, nine from Glendora and one from Temple City, police and sheriff's 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora Police Agent Kathy Harbour said victims reported that the caller 
sounds like a male in his 30s, possibly with an East Coast or New York accent. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the caller informs women that he has abducted their husbands for 
ransom, tied them up and gagged them, and is holding a gun to their heads. 
Edwards said the caller has demanded from $2,000 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
No one apparently has given the caller any money. 
</P>
<P>
He also has ordered the women to call him "Sir" and has used the husbands' 
first names. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Monte Yancey of the Pasadena Police Department said that in some 
instances, the husbands were present when their wives received the calls. The 
last report in Pasadena was a week ago, Yancey said. 
</P>
<P>
The caller sometimes threatens wives by telling them that two men are standing 
outside their homes waiting for them, Harbour said. The caller also has asked 
sexually explicit questions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's authorities in Temple City said the latest report came from a woman 
who called Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The woman did not file a formal police report, Sheriff's Deputy Jeff Patterson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, the man made at least four calls to Monrovia women, 
police said. One of the victims was Pasadena Star-News reporter Janice Luder, 
who wrote a first-person piece on the incident for Thursday's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The caller, Luder wrote, said he had her husband bound and gagged and added "I 
have a gun to his head." 
</P>
<P>
When she asked if he was serious, the caller responded: "This is not a joke, 
and I will do the talking. You just listen." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Luder hung up and called her husband at work. He was not there. 
</P>
<P>
"My mouth went dry and my legs felt like sprung guitar strings," Luder said in 
the article. 
</P>
<P>
As she dialed 911, "a creeping sense of foreboding and vulnerability took over. 
Please God, let him be alright (sic)," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
She said the 911 operator told her that she was the fourth woman in 20 minutes 
to report a similar call. 
</P>
<P>
"My first reaction was relief," she wrote. "I was just another random victim of 
some sicko. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I felt angry and violated," she said. "A faceless voice momentarily had 
held incredible power over me." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Flynn, a spokeswoman for Pacific Bell, said the company has been 
informed of the calls. 
</P>
<P>
"For obscene phone calls . . . we recommend simply hanging up," she said. Calls 
can be traced if customers request it. However, because the caller only phones 
once, such technology would be unlikely to help. Phone company officials were 
unable to determine Thursday whether anyone had requested tracing in connection 
with the case. 
</P>
<P>
Police and sheriff's officials said there are no plans to form a task force to 
catch the caller. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Martin Reiser, chief psychologist for the Los Angeles Police Department, 
said such callers frequently are sexually motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"People who make threats and phone calls and try to get some kind of sexual 
response obviously are people with sexual hang-ups and probably are getting 
some kind of satisfaction from possibly upsetting the woman in the first place 
and by getting response from the woman," Reiser said.

20 ILLEGALS RESCUED, HANDED TO INS AGENTS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE ACTION FANS A POLICY DEBATE IN CITY COUNCIL. GATES DEFENDS 
OFFICERS' ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the midst of negotiations aimed at clarifying when police can turn illegal 
immigrants over to federal authorities, Los Angeles police officers Thursday 
called in the Immigration and Naturalization Service after rescuing 20 aliens 
from smugglers who were holding them hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Police were alerted to the situation by a frantic call from a man in Reno who 
reported that his wife and children were being held by alien smugglers in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found the woman, her 2-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son, along 
with 17 other suspected illegal Mexican immigrants, inside a "locked and 
barred, run-down sweatbox of a house" in the 4800 block of South McKinley 
Avenue. The smugglers were apparently holding the aliens for ransom, according 
to Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
After police apprehended the suspected smugglers and rescued their hostages, 
they turned the entire group over to the INS, which began deportation 
proceedings against the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Michael Woo said Thursday that the Police Department "has gone 
too far in trying to enforce the job of the INS." 
</P>
<P>
Woo has led an effort in recent months to strengthen a longstanding LAPD policy 
that already bans police from turning aliens over to immigration authorities 
without cause. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that Chief Gates is not distinguishing between criminals, victims and 
witnesses," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Woo predicted that Thursday's police action -- similar to one that occurred 
last month when 27 aliens were turned over to the INS -- would send "shock 
waves out to immigrants that they should be afraid of contacting police even if 
they are merely victims or witnesses to crime." 
</P>
<P>
Gates defended his officers' action in a press release, saying that the LAPD 
"makes absolutely no effort to seek out undocumented (aliens). . . . Of our own 
accord, we do not initiate action against anyone merely because of their 
immigration status." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that "when we are confronted by serious criminal actions . . 
. we cannot look the other way." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said that the handling of the hostage case is in keeping with the 
department's 1979 policy to not go after immigrants merely because of their 
illegal status. 
</P>
<P>
How well the department is adhering to this policy, however, has been the focus 
of a growing controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, immigrant advocates testified at a City Council committee 
hearing that police increasingly have turned over to the INS victims and 
witnesses of crimes, who then are almost certain to be deported. And, they 
testified, this policy is stirring a growing mistrust of police on the part of 
immigrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely do not want to interfere with the ability of the police to do 
their job," said City Councilman Richard Alatorre, who chaired the hearing held 
earlier this week before the city's Public Safety Committee. "However, it is 
cases like this that point to the need to clarify just what the policy is." 
</P>
<P>
INS officials, meanwhile, maintained police "did the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage cooperation between the INS and local law enforcement agencies," 
said INS District Director Robert Moschorak. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, INS agents apprehended an additional 36 suspected illegal 
aliens and two smugglers at the same Los Angeles address as the smugglers 
pulled up to the house with another van filled with people. These suspects were 
immediately taken into INS custody. 
</P>
<P>
Moschorak said his office had begun the process of filing criminal charges 
against five suspected smugglers and deportation proceedings against the 20 
aliens who were held hostage -- including the woman and her two children who 
sparked the investigation -- as well as the 36 apprehended later. 
</P>
<P>
Some may voluntarily leave the country. A few will be asked to temporarily 
remain in the country as material witnesses against the smugglers, Moschorak 
said.

VICTIM AID PROGRAM GETS 7TH ADVOCATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County will add a seventh victim advocate to its Victim/Witness 
Assistance program under a plan approved this week by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The new advocate will concentrate on assisting victims of domestic violence, 
said Kathleen McGoldrick, the program's director. 
</P>
<P>
She said the state will provide the $31,248 needed to hire the new staff 
member. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1990-91, the county will provide $145,389 of the program's $310,389 
budget, with some of the funding coming from fines criminals are ordered to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
The board approved the position Tuesday although some supervisors expressed 
displeasure with McGoldrick's warning that "to turn away victims at this point 
is giving the cold shoulder" to targets of domestic and sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't appreciate the political speech," Supervisor James R. Dougherty said 
after McGoldrick told of several cases in which women and children had been 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
However, he joined his fellow supervisors in voting to continue the program. 
</P>
<P>
McGoldrick said she feared that despite sharp increases in violent crime, the 
program was in danger of being cut. 
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 crime victims and their families were assisted by the 
Victim/Witness agency last year, McGoldrick said. Advocates provide services 
such as counseling, crisis intervention and help in obtaining restraining 
orders, she said. JACK SEARLES

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CARE-A-VAN TAKES RESIDENTS TO DOCTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike most Ventura County residents who rely on public transportation, 
residents of Camarillo and Somis need not drive, call a taxi or take the bus to 
visit a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
In the only service of its kind in the county, the Camarillo Health Care 
District offers an inexpensive door-to-door service to people who need to get 
to a routine doctor's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
The health care district is similar to a school district in that it is a 
governmental entity and not a commercial enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
The district's non-emergency medical transportation service is the only public 
program that offers citizens of all ages rides to doctors' offices throughout 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
For a fee ranging from $3.50 to $8.50 for a one-way trip, depending on the 
destination, residents can schedule a ride up to two weeks in advance or with 
as little notice as 48 hours, said Annette Montoya, director of the Care-A-Van 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The Care-A-Van program offers residents an alternative to taxi fares that can 
reach $40 and infrequent bus service. However, taxicab companies in Oxnard, 
Port Hueneme and Thousand Oaks offer senior citizens low-cost rides to 
destinations within city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Our service is absolutely critical," Montoya said. "Without us, many people 
simply wouldn't be able to get the routine medical care they need." 
</P>
<P>
Since it was established four years ago, the program has grown from 
transporting an average of 400 residents a month to 550, prompting health care 
district officials last April to purchase a new van to keep up with the demand, 
Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which subsidizes the transportation program, now owns three vans 
with space for 20 passengers and seven wheelchairs, she said. CAROLYN KUSKY

LANDLADY BEATEN; EVICTED TENANT HELD

<TEXT>
<P>
A 38-year-old Ventura man was arrested on suspicion of severely beating his 
landlady who had evicted him. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Gayle Wagoner, 38, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder at 
4:35 p.m. Wednesday after he was located in Glendora, said Sgt. Bob Velez of 
the Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the landlady, Arlys Quinn, 47, evicted Wagoner on Monday from his 
rental in the 9600 block of Coosa Street in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
She was aided in the eviction by the Ventura Police Department and the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department. The Sheriff's Department often oversees evictions 
for overdue rent, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Wagoner stopped Quinn in a shopping center parking lot and 
pleaded with her to let him into his former residence so he could retrieve some 
medicine he had left behind, Velez said. 
</P>
<P>
Wagoner told Quinn that the medicine was essential to his baby, who was ill, 
and Quinn let him in, Velez said. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside the residence, Wagoner became enraged with Quinn because of the 
eviction and told her that he was going to kill her, Velez said. Wagoner then 
struck Quinn with a 2-foot-long iron bar, possibly a fireplace poker, at least 
a dozen times on the head and body, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, who was bleeding profusely from her wounds, ran screaming from the 
house, Velez said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses, who helped Quinn, told police that they saw Wagoner walk calmly to 
his car and drive away. 
</P>
<P>
The police followed leads and discovered Wagoner was in Glendora, where the 
Glendora Police Department took him into custody, Velez said. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn remains in stable condition in the intensive care unit of Community 
Memorial Hospital in Ventura, a hospital spokeswoman said. CAROL WATSON

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAIL FACILITY STUDIED FOR ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Postal Service officials announced Thursday that they hope to build a mail 
facility in the Antelope Valley in the next several years as part of an effort 
to improve service and shorten delivery times in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Regional Postmaster William Jackson said the new facility could be anything 
from a 200,000-square-foot mail processing center on about 20 acres to a 
substantially smaller distribution center, depending on the outcome of studies 
on the area's service needs.

"We've got to manage and service the growth in the Antelope Valley area," 
Jackson said. "We've got what was a rural area rapidly becoming an urban area." 
He said his Van Nuys-based postal headquarters should have a specific proposal 
for the Antelope Valley facility by next month. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service's goal will be to give Antelope Valley residents overnight 
delivery of letters addressed to at least some Los Angeles areas. Now it 
usually takes two days to get mail to Los Angeles. Any new facility would 
require approval from postal officials in Washington.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN CHARGED WITH KEEPING WILD ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities have filed charges against an Acton woman for failing to have a 
license to keep exotic animals at her ranch and other violations in connection 
with a raid at her house this week. 
</P>
<P>
Officials removed 13 bobcats and numerous other animals from the yard. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Jennifer Arn, 44, was charged with eight counts of keeping wild animals 
without a license in addition to other misdemeanor counts, including operating 
an unlicensed kennel and failing to provide rabies vaccinations for 40 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Each charge carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald L. Smalstig of the Lancaster district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Arn, who remains under psychiatric observation at Olive View Hospital in 
Sylmar, will be arraigned Aug. 8, Smalstig said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED UNDER NEW PORNOGRAPHY LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys man has been ordered to undergo psychiatric counseling after 
pleading guilty to possession of child pornography, in the first city case 
prosecuted under a new state law, the Los Angeles city attorney's office 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Earl Wiese, 40, was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to 
donate $1,000 to the Children's Home Society, a nonprofit organization that 
helps abused children, after entering his plea Monday in Los Angeles Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Wiese was convicted under a law drafted by Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn 
and passed last year by the California Legislature making it illegal to possess 
child pornography. The statute went into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Wiese was arrested Jan. 23 after police discovered pornographic materials in 
his bedroom. The materials included magazines, books, photographs and 
videotapes depicting nude children engaged in sex acts, Deputy City Atty. Tracy 
Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
Police discovered the materials while investigating an alleged rape at the 
residence, Webb said. Wiese was not a suspect in the rape. Wiese, who was a 
manager of a La Crescenta McDonald's restaurant before his arrest, faced a 
maximum sentence of one year in jail, Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said similar laws have been passed in other states and were recently 
upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that a state's interest in 
protecting children outweighed the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of 
speech in such cases.

OWNERS RECONSIDER CLOSING ICE-SKATING RINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the owners of Burbank's Pickwick Ice Arena reconsider their decision to 
close the popular rink, skating enthusiasts plan to rally Saturday in a show of 
support for the landmark facility. 
</P>
<P>
Pickwick General Manager Frank Silvio said the owners are having second 
thoughts about closing the arena and have hired contractors to inspect the 
aging facility to determine whether they can afford to renovate it. 
</P>
<P>
Despite excellent business receipts, owners Walter and Edward Stavert announced 
last month that they planned to close the rink Sept. 30 because of major repair 
bills and rising liability insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement of the closure, skating enthusiasts have launched a 
campaign to halt -- or at least delay -- the demise of the rink, which is home 
to one of the most successful competitive skating clubs in the country and a 
popular practice arena for local hockey teams. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, members of Save the Ice Committee are planning to hold their 
second rally, said Chairman John Halebian. The Staverts have been invited to 
attend the 10 a.m. rally at Buena Vista Park in Burbank in the hope that they 
will announce that the 29-year-old rink will remain open until regular patrons 
can find another arena. 
</P>
<P>
Also this week, the Burbank Park and Recreation Board sent a letter to the 
Staverts asking if the board could help them keep the rink open. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of your recent announcement anticipating the closure of the Pickwick 
Ice Arena, the members of the Burbank Park and Recreation Board would encourage 
you to reconsider that decision," the letter from Chairman Edwin LaRocque read. 
</P>
<P>
When the rink opened in 1961, it was a place where families and children came 
to glide casually across the ice. But casual skating has declined, and the 
arena now caters mostly to skaters in training and private clubs, which account 
for about 70% of Pickwick's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The highly competitive Los Angeles Figure Skating Club, which has nurtured such 
Olympic skaters as Linda Fratianne, Tiffany Chin and Christopher Bowman, has 
been based at the rink since it opened.

3 CHARGED IN DEATH OF SAN FERNANDO SWAP MEET GUARD; 
</P>
<P>
SHOOTING: THE VICTIM, LUCKY TEAL, HELD MANY JOBS TO SUPPORT 15 CHILDREN. ONE OF 
HIS TASKS WAS COUNSELING YOUNG OFFENDERS. 
</P>

<P>
Roland (Lucky) Teal used to preach on Sundays to the young criminal defendants 
at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. Now a youth charged in his killing is being held 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Pacoima youth was among three suspects charged Thursday with 
murdering Teal, who was a popular security guard at the San Fernando Swap Meet. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities alleged that the juvenile, along with Ricardo Roldan, 19, of 
Pacoima and Richard Zorns, 19, of Arleta took part in a June 3 robbery at the 
swap meet in which Teal, 61, was shot in the back when he tried to stop them. 
Teal was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
Each suspect was charged with murder, attempted murder and robbery. Roldan and 
Zorns were being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman said he will seek to 
have the 17-year-old tried as an adult and he will ask for the death penalty 
for Roldan because allegedly he was the triggerman who killed Teal with an 
Uzi-style assault weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Teal of Pacoima had 15 children and stepchildren. Nine of them, ranging in age 
from 3 to 16, were living at home at the time of his death and he worked 
several jobs to support his family. He owned a tire store in Pacoima, headed a 
crew that swept parking lots at night and for 21 years was a fixture at the 
swap meet at 585 Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
"Just about everybody in San Fernando knew Lucky," said Lt. Rico Castro, head 
of the detective squad at the San Fernando Police Department. "He was always 
there at the swap meet." 
</P>
<P>
Teal was known as a friendly man who was eager to help patrons and sellers at 
the market. Occasionally, he would take children who became lost at the 
open-air market and feed them while he tried to locate their parents. Often his 
own children would go to the swap meet when he worked. One of his sons was 
there when he was shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
"He never had trouble there," said his wife, Louise. "Everybody knew him and 
respected him. He didn't even carry a gun. Before this, there never was a 
reason to." 
</P>
<P>
Louise Teal said her husband took time from his busy work schedule to be 
involved in the Pacoima Chamber of Commerce and to go to the Sylmar Juvenile 
Hall on Sundays to counsel and preach to young criminal offenders. 
</P>
<P>
"He cared a lot about people and the community," she said. "He was very 
involved. That's why so many people knew him. That's why this whole thing is so 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
According to police, at 4 p.m. on June 3, Roldan and the juvenile suspect 
allegedly robbed swat meet manager Barnie Pipkin, 68, as he stepped out of his 
office with bags containing $12,000 in receipts he planned to deposit at a 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers fired a shot at Pipkin but missed and fled to a nearby car driven 
by Zorns, police said. Teal jumped in his van and chased the car, cutting it 
off on nearby Borden Street. When the juvenile tried to run away with the money 
bags, Teal grabbed him. Roldan allegedly came up behind Teal and shot him in 
the back, police said. The suspects escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Detective David Harvey said the investigation focused on Roldan after the 
investigators reviewed reports on other swap meet robberies and learned of an 
Oct. 31, 1988, robbery at a Sun Valley swap meet in which an automatic assault 
rifle was used. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives learned that Roldan had been arrested in the 1988 robbery but 
was free on $7,500 bail at the time of Teal's shooting. Roldan was convicted 
June 5 of robbery and is awaiting sentencing in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey said that on July 12 detectives with a search warrant gathered evidence 
from Roldan's home that also implicated Zorns and the juvenile in the robbery 
and slaying. Zorns was located in the Los Angeles County Jail, where he had 
been held since July 10 in an unrelated burglary in Arleta. The juvenile was 
arrested Tuesday when he surrendered at the San Fernando police station. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the three suspects are known to associate with gang members. None 
of the money taken in the robbery nor the gun used has been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Teal said Thursday that since her husband's death she has had to close 
the tire store because she has her hands full with her young children. She said 
she is unsure how she will be able to support her family without her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"Lucky did a lot of different jobs -- seemed he had his hand in everything -- 
so he could support us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I don't know what we are going to do."

HIRING CENTER IS LURING WORKERS BUT ONLY A HANDFUL OF EMPLOYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Men seeking work continue to crowd the city's first hiring center for day 
laborers in the San Fernando Valley, but employers apparently have yet to 
discover the dusty North Hollywood lot on Sherman Way between Radford and Hinds 
avenues. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 men have been gathering each morning at the center, opened last week 
on a Department of Water and Power lot a few blocks west of Lankershim 
Boulevard. But only about five prospective employers show up on an average day, 
said Bill Molina, management analyst for the Community Development Department, 
which runs the center. 
</P>
<P>
At a dedication ceremony Tuesday, city officials and others who helped organize 
the center encouraged employers to hire workers from the site rather than the 
street corners and parking lots where many day laborers still congregate. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, whose district includes the 
center, said the facility provides a "responsible place" for men to wait for 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"This benefits the entire community, not just the people who come here looking 
for work," Bernardi said. "We want to make this an overwhelming success so we 
can expand it into other areas of the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Bert Corona, executive director of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, an immigrant 
rights group that helped organize the center, said the site is "humanizing the 
effort for those who hunger for work." 
</P>
<P>
While they wait for work, men at the center are offered free coffee, pastries 
and English lessons. Picnic tables and portable toilets have been set up at the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The center is intended to serve the 150 to 200 laborers who congregate on 
Lankershim between Strathern and Saticoy streets and reduce problems caused by 
loitering workers. Funded by the city, the facility costs about $3,500 a month 
to operate. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second such gathering place for workers in the city of Los Angeles. A 
similar facility was opened in Harbor City last fall.

YELTSIN ORDERS END TO OFFICIAL PERKS IN RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist president of Russia, on Thursday decreed an end 
to the privileges enjoyed by Communist Party bureaucrats, government officials 
and industrial managers in the Russian Federation, the largest Soviet republic, 
in an unprecedented assault on the political elite. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, true to his "common man" political philosophy, declared that 
"privileges violate social fairness" and that benefits not directly earned by a 
person's own labor should be outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
Using his broad powers as chairman of the Presidium of the Russian Supreme 
Soviet, the republic's legislature, Yeltsin said the government was canceling, 
effective immediately, "all kinds and forms of official privileges" and 
invalidating all the laws, decrees and orders authorizing them. 
</P>
<P>
All officials, "no matter what posts they hold," fall under its terms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decree puckishly orders that the Russian Supreme Soviet's committee on 
glasnost, or political openness, oversee its enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's legal authority for such a sweeping move is not clear, but the broad 
terms in which Soviet laws, including the national and republican 
constitutions, are written may give him such powers. In Soviet legal theory, 
the power of the parliament is supreme, and it can be exercised fully by its 
legislative and executive bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Still, whether Yeltsin can enforce such a decree against federal bodies, the 
Soviet military, the Communist Party and the many enterprises with operational 
autonomy is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, determined to exercise the "sovereignty" decreed by the Russian 
Congress of People's Deputies in May, has already challenged the central 
government on other fundamental issues, asserting control of the republic's 
economy and its banking system. 
</P>
<P>
With typical boldness, he has now cut through years of argument and 
counter-argument about the special benefits enjoyed by the political elite and 
by a wide range of other "privileged" people, including war veterans, invalids, 
"heroine-mothers" with large families and Communist Party stalwarts. 
</P>
<P>
To replace them, the decree orders the republics' soviets, or elected 
governmental councils, to decide on "the concrete conditions of work and the 
kinds of services for senior officials" and sets an Aug. 1 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Abolished were privileges "on power, on unearned remunerations, on undeserved 
benefits, (and) on undeserved and unearned comfortable working and living 
conditions for the leading workers of organizations, enterprises and offices 
and for workers of state organs." 
</P>
<P>
The effect, if the decree is fully enforced, should be to end a system where 
the pay is low, often no more than that of a skilled worker, and the benefits 
extensive. 
</P>
<P>
In its place, under the Yeltsin system, the soviet for which the official works 
or that oversees the enterprise that employs him will decide on his pay and 
benefits, and the decision will be debated publicly. The decree also requires 
that the decisions be published in the press. 
</P>
<P>
In a have-not era, little has grated upon the average Soviet worker as much as 
the well-stocked stores, comfortable apartments, chauffeur-driven cars, seaside 
vacations and other benefits available -- regularly but never openly -- to 
their bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who boasts of his family's simple life style, including the lines that 
his wife stands in to buy food, has campaigned hard on the issue of privilege 
and won election to both the Russian and national parliaments with pledges to 
abolish them. 
</P>
<P>
When questioned about "privileges," party officials have replied defensively 
that they were really just compensation for the responsibilities they carried 
and for their long hours. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of the government and party bureaucracy, as well as industrial 
managers, argued that such benefits would always be justified as long as the 
country had a planned economy in which scarce resources -- in this case, such 
basics as food and housing -- were allocated according to the government's 
priorities rather than left to the market forces of supply and demand to 
regulate. 
</P>
<P>
They have also argued that their salaries are kept relatively low in a spirit 
of egalitarianism, so that a senior government official might be paid little 
more than a bus driver. 
</P>
<P>
Past attempts at reform have brought some reductions in the privileges, 
including the closure of many stores that served only the elite, the acceptance 
by special medical clinics of ordinary patients, the reduction in the number of 
government limousines and the transfer to public use of many vacation homes and 
exclusive resorts. 
</P>
<P>
A special commission under Yevgeny M. Primakov, a member of the Presidential 
Council, the country's top policy-making body, has been studying the question 
for months but with no apparent progress. Until now, the authorities have not 
attempted such a radical approach. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took some action against the 
privileged elite by deciding that the country's current and former leaders, 
except for himself and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, were no longer 
entitled to luxuries such as country houses. 
</P>
<P>
Some retired members of the Communist Party's leadership, some in their 90s, 
were ordered to move out of the houses, and others were ordered to pay rent to 
the state organizations that owned them. They also lost the right to 
state-employed household workers and government cars and access to the special 
food stores. 
</P>
<P>
Almost in anticipation of Yeltsin's decree, the popular youth newspaper 
Komsomolskaya Pravda, in an usual personal story, reported Thursday on the 
simple life that Gorbachev's 79-year-old mother lives in their native village 
in southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Gorbachev only recently got a new color television to replace her old 
black-and-white set, the paper said, and she still bakes her own bread. Her 
only privilege is the detachment of KGB agents who provide security down the 
road from her small house in the village of Privolnoye. 
</P>
<P>
A new paint job on her house, and the color TV that recently replaced the old 
"Rekord" black-and-white set, "have not cost the state or the party one 
kopeck," the paper's correspondent said. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, a rumor spread that she was moving to Moscow and selling her 
house, the newspaper said. Residents of Privolnoye were ready to make inquiries 
about buying her house, but she said she was not leaving Privolnoye. 
</P>
<P>
"I have already lived in Moscow," she told local party officials. "I don't see 
my son here, and I wouldn't see him there. He leaves home at 6 a.m. and returns 
late in the evening. . . . I will not go anywhere."

ANC TAKES ITS MESSAGE TO OLD FOES; 
</P>
<P>
THE ONCE-BANNED AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS IS REACHING OUT TO WHITE SOUTH 
AFRICANS, AND THIS SEEMS TO BE REDUCING FEARS ABOUT BLACKS IN POWER.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wealthy whites were still packing away the Caesar salad and grilled sole at 
O'Hagan's uptown nightclub when the bartender shut down the tap. It was only 
8:30 p.m., but this was one night the manager wanted everyone sober. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as ceiling fans stirred the smoky air, an elderly black man in a suit and 
tie took the stage usually reserved for Cy Saks, Eddie Eckstein and the other 
comics who send the suburbanites home smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Sisulu, the 78-year-old former prisoner and now domestic leader of the 
African National Congress, squinted into the spotlights. 
</P>
<P>
The emcee said Sisulu's appearance would be brief because he "still has a long 
way to go home," and indeed he did -- from the mansions of Johannesburg's 
wealthiest white suburb to his four-room house in black Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
Truth be told, it was also getting close to his bedtime. But Sisulu said he 
felt duty-bound "to come to the people of South Africa in whatever little 
corner they are in. They may not accept my politics, but I must come to them." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, hated and feared by most whites in South Africa for 30 years, is 
taking its show onto some unfamiliar roads across the country. Men and women 
whose names were once identified with armed revolution are appearing in 
boardrooms, classrooms, radio studios and even nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is more than the ANC's political strength. The entire peace process 
may hinge on the organization's ability to convince South Africans, especially 
worried whites, that the once-banned ANC is not as bad as right-wing groups say 
it is and that the government was right to open talks with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We are reaching out to whites," said Ahmed Kathrada, ANC publicity secretary. 
"It's slow going, but it's better than before, when they (whites) were a solid, 
granite block." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC's outreach program resembles a multilayered political campaign. Local 
ANC organizers talk to small, neighborhood groups in black townships and go 
door-to-door to recruit new members. Deputy President Nelson Mandela addresses 
mass rallies and leads the international fund-raising effort. And the national 
headquarters dispatches its best-known figures to microphones in the farthest 
reaches of the country. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the white audiences have been curious and respectful, 
resigned to the inevitability of blacks in government and trying to make the 
best of it. Few are converted, but many have left with their fears about the 
ANC reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the ANC leaders say, the mere fact that they are appearing on 
public platforms and being quoted in newspapers for the first time in years has 
meant a massive change in the way people regard the ANC," said Andre du Toit, a 
professor of political studies at the University of Cape Town. And, in many 
ways, he added, "they (the ANC) appear to be a pretty moderate and reasonable 
crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Slovo, among the ANC leaders the most feared by white South Africans, 
certainly sounded every bit the rational politician as he answered questions 
for two hours last Wednesday night on a radio call-in program in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
Slovo said he is committed to peace in South Africa and expressed confidence in 
President Frederik W. de Klerk, whom he described as "a reasonable man." He 
also defended the ANC's bombing campaign, which he helped direct for years from 
exile in Lusaka, Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
"Place yourself in the shoes of a black man back in 1960," he told one caller. 
"Their leaders were detained and banned; the police fired on their 
demonstrations. You tell me, if you as a white man were placed in a country 
with those conditions, and you had any guts, you would take up a weapon. And 
every civilized person in the world would do the same." 
</P>
<P>
Slovo, who is white, is secretary general of the South African Communist Party. 
As was the case with most of the ANC leaders returning now from exile, his 
words and photograph were banned inside the country until five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, Chris Hani, current chief of staff of the ANC's military 
wing, was trying to reassure business leaders in a packed conference room at 
the Horseshoe Motel in the Eastern Cape region, once a hotbed of black 
militancy. 
</P>
<P>
"My party stands for a mixed economy in a multi-party state in a free and 
democratic South Africa," the 47-year-old Hani told about 200 black and white 
executives questioning the ANC's policy of nationalizing some industries. 
</P>
<P>
Hani said the ANC plans "no wholesale nationalization" but that some state 
ownership would be needed "to bridge the gap between rich and poor." Although 
outnumbered 5 to 1 by blacks, whites hold most of the nation's wealth because 
blacks have been denied full participation in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Few business leaders have been mollified by the ANC's tap-dancing on 
nationalization, but many have come to believe, as business leader Murray 
Hofmeyr put it after a daylong meeting with the ANC, "The good news is, 
gracious me, we all realize we really are in the same boat." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC also has ventured into the hallowed halls of Afrikanerdom to talk 
directly to the descendants of South Africa's white settlers, the people who 
first instituted apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's foreign affairs chief, gently teased 1,000 students who 
turned out to see him a few weeks ago at Stellenbosch University, the citadel 
of higher education for white Afrikaners and a training ground for most of the 
nation's white leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope you don't mind if I call you 'Comrades,' " Mbeki said, eliciting 
laughter from the assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past this university was forbidden territory for some of us, but it is 
no longer so, and I think this reflects what is happening in the country as a 
whole," added Mbeki, who has spent most of his 47 years in exile. 
</P>
<P>
Now "we'd like to see this university, with all its prestige, authority and 
weight, count itself among the forces producing the new South Africa and to 
become part of the process of change." 
</P>
<P>
He spoke of white fears of the ANC as "natural and to be expected." But he 
added that Stellenbosch could play an important role in telling other whites 
that "the thing to fear is . . . the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Sisulu ventured into another white preserve when he accepted the 
invitation to O'Hagan's, in a suburb where iron grillwork and brick walls 
shield sprawling homes with Jaguars and Mercedes-Benzes. 
</P>
<P>
The South Africans who live here, far from the overcrowded black townships, are 
often politically liberal, sending their children to multiracial private 
schools and supporting equal rights for blacks. But, being the prime 
beneficiaries of the economy, they strongly oppose the ANC's support for 
economic sanctions and its desire to redistribute the country's wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu's hourlong question-and-answer session here was billed as a 
"no-holds-barred" evening, refereed by Tony Sanderson, the host of a local 
cable TV talk show. "Come in and challenge him!" promotional posters said. 
</P>
<P>
The new experience for the white diners started at the oak doors, where a tall, 
muscled black man -- Sisulu's ANC bodyguard -- patted down the male patrons and 
searched the women's handbags. 
</P>
<P>
A thin doorman in a tuxedo watched uncomfortably. "We're very sorry for this," 
he said to each group of diners. "This is very unusual." 
</P>
<P>
But it was an unusual night in general. At precisely 9 p.m., with the dishes 
cleared and candlelight dancing on sober faces in the room, Sanderson opened 
the show with a plea. 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't enter into a slanging match," he said, adding that Sisulu "is a 
moderate gentleman, and I want you to treat him with the moderation he 
deserves." 
</P>
<P>
Few in the audience had ever seen a member of the ANC in person before, and 
they gingerly took advantage of the opportunity to question this one. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Sisulu, have you any bitterness about your 27 years in prison?" he was 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of anger as far as I am concerned," Sisulu told the 
patrons, most of whom supported the government that put him in jail. "I am 
writing it off completely. There were times I was angry at certain individuals, 
but I knew the future was mine." 
</P>
<P>
He later recounted his years in jail, where he was serving a life sentence for 
sabotage along with Mandela. Until the 1980s, he said, he and his fellow 
inmates were not allowed newspapers. But they followed events by collecting 
scraps of newspapers from the prison garbage dumps and quizzing their visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"You find a way of talking to your visitors to find out what the situation is, 
and then you put it all together later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the ANC's ties with the Communist Party, Sisulu said it was "an 
alliance we hope to continue." But, he added, both the ANC and the party "have 
their own ideologies and philosophies, and the alliance may not (continue) in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
"He's quite a skillful politician, but a bit of a rough diamond, isn't he?" one 
of the diners, George Henderson, said later. "He seemed sharp enough. But we'll 
have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC's desire to take some control of the economy "worries a lot of us," 
added Henderson, 52, who manages a factory that makes electrical appliances. 
"Socialism is a failed policy." 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu was asked why the ANC wanted foreign governments to maintain sanctions 
against Pretoria, when the sanctions had created unemployment and economic 
hardship among blacks and hurt the South African economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We think sanctions are the shortest way to bring about a new order in South 
Africa," he said. "And, in fact, it has worked. Perhaps I am here today after 
27 years in jail because of sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
The evening's cover charge, about $8, went to the ANC, prompting one man to ask 
Sisulu if "any part of my bill tonight (will) go to buy a bullet or a bomb for 
Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation)," the military wing of the ANC. Said 
Sisulu: The ANC will decide. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson saw his guest off with polite applause and congratulated the patrons 
on their civilized behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"This is how it all starts," he said. "As long as there is a dialogue existing, 
there is hope at the end of this dark tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
Then, with the night still young, the bar reopened for business.

DEDICATION: THREE FORMER PRESIDENTS AT YORBA LINDA CEREMONY. BUSH MAKES THE 
ONLY MENTION OF WATERGATE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard M. Nixon dedicated his presidential library Thursday to the ringing 
applause of his three Republican successors and 50,000 spectators, proclaiming 
his belief in the American Dream but not mentioning the Watergate scandal that 
drove him from office 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Three brass bands played, red-suited trumpeters heralded the arrival of the 
Presidents and organizers sent red, white and blue balloons aloft at the end of 
the 2 1/2-hour ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing we have ever seen matches this moment -- to be welcomed home again," 
Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
As he did in his latest book, "In the Arena," he spoke about the theme of 
struggle and the role it has played in his life from his childhood in Yorba 
Linda to his political victories and tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in the American Dream because I have seen it come true in my own 
life," he said. "You will suffer disappointments in your life and sometimes you 
will be discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sad to lose," he continued. "But the greatest sadness is to travel 
through life without knowing either victory or defeat." 
</P>
<P>
The gathering on the open-air stage marked the first conclave of four 
Presidents in nine years and the first time ever that four American Presidents 
attended a public event. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Nixon were joined by Gerald R. Ford, Nixon's successor, and 
Ronald Reagan, Bush's predecessor. Each man was accompanied by his wife. Only 
Democrat Jimmy Carter did not attend, citing a prior commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Seated in the sweltering audience were a "Who's Who" of the Nixon years and 
later Republican administrations, including four former secretaries of state -- 
Henry Kissinger, William Rogers, George P. Shultz and Alexander Haig. The four 
drew hordes of autograph seekers and photographers as they sat nearly shoulder 
to shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering in this small Orange County city -- as well as a dinner in 
Nixon's honor in Century City on Thursday night -- also attracted protesters 
against government policy on Central America, and on behalf of the homeless, 
AIDS research and the environment. A small number briefly interrupted Bush's 
Yorba Linda speech honoring Nixon, but there were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
The Century City demonstration was louder, and larger, and Los Angeles police 
made some arrests, but there was no violence. 
</P>
<P>
Mixing with former colleagues in the special VIP section were H.R. Haldeman, 
chief of staff in the Nixon White House, and Maurice Stans, former secretary of 
commerce. Haldeman was convicted of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and 
perjury in the Watergate break-in and cover-up. Stans pleaded guilty to 
violating election laws covering contributions to Nixon's reelection campaign 
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Each President spoke, but only Bush said the W word -- Watergate. He told the 
crowd that museum-goers "will hear of Horatio Alger and Alger Hiss. Of 
(Nixon's) book, 'Six Crises,' and the seventh crisis, Watergate." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was among those who broke with Nixon's defenders in the last days of the 
Nixon presidency. After the revelation of the final "smoking gun" tape showing 
that Nixon had tried to use the CIA to block the FBI's investigation of 
Watergate, Bush hand-delivered a letter to the White House saying: "I would now 
ill-serve a President, whose massive accomplishments I will always respect, and 
whose family I love, if I did not give you my judgment . . . resignation is 
best for this country, best for this President." 
</P>
<P>
It was the same tape that virtually assured that the House of Representatives 
would vote for impeachment. Two days later, Nixon became the first President to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 29, 1974, Nixon was named an unindicted co-conspirator in a sealed 
indictment by the special Watergate grand jury. The news did not become public 
until June of that year. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's library dedication was widely viewed as a milestone in Nixon's 
political rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
The $21-million presidential library, the first in California, is next door to 
the simple wooden farmhouse his father built from a kit several years before 
Nixon was born in 1913. Bush hailed Nixon as "the quintessence of middle 
America," a man who spoke loudly and eloquently for the "silent majority from 
Dallas to Davenport, Syracuse to Silver City." 
</P>
<P>
Bush recalled the highlights of Nixon's presidency, citing his trip to China, 
ending more than two decades of U.S.-China bitterness, and his peace efforts in 
the Middle East. He added: "Who can forget how in Moscow, Richard Nixon signed 
the first agreement to limit strategic nuclear arms -- giving new hope to the 
world for a lasting peace? 
</P>
<P>
"Finally and most importantly, I would say to visitors: Richard Nixon helped 
change the course not only of America but of the entire world," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The President said future generations will remember Nixon most "for dedicating 
his life to the greatest cause offered any President -- the cause of peace 
among nations." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan joked about Nixon's rocky relationship with the media: "Much has been 
written and said about Richard Nixon; some of it has even been true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will come as no surprise to anyone here that there will always be a good 
deal of debate about Richard Nixon," Reagan said. "Generally speaking, people 
in public life who take bold steps, who make tough decisions and who show great 
courage, generate controversy." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan called Nixon a patriot and praised his contributions in foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard Nixon is a man who understands the world," Reagan said, "a man whose 
foreign policy was universally acknowledged as brilliant. I don't think it's an 
exaggeration to say the world is a better place -- a safer place -- because of 
Richard Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
Ford recalled going to Congress for the first time in 1949 and meeting Nixon, 
who had been elected two years earlier to the lower house but was "already 
renowned as the nemesis of Alger Hiss," the alleged State Department spy for 
the Soviet Union who was convicted of perjury. 
</P>
<P>
The Hiss case started Nixon's quick rise to power, which saw him become a U.S. 
senator in 1950 and vice president in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the wave of democracy sweeping across eastern Europe, Ford 
credited the four Presidents and the American people, but especially Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
William E. Simon, Nixon's former treasury secretary and president of the 
library foundation, spoke most bluntly about Nixon's decades-long battles with 
the news media. Simon said Nixon's accomplishments came "despite . . . the 
unrelenting hostility of the national media." 
</P>
<P>
The four Presidents toured the house where Nixon was born, and which has been 
restored and given a brand-new look. It contains the piano he played and the 
bed in which he was born. The four also toured the museum, the only 
presidential museum financed and operated entirely by private funds. 
</P>
<P>
Police and library officials said the crowd of 50,000 included dozens who 
camped out overnight on the sidewalks on Yorba Linda Boulevard, site of the 
building, to ensure a place near the front of the line. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands more began arriving as early as 4 a.m., many of them wearing "Nixon's 
No. 1" T-shirts. Others wore hats shaped like elephants -- the Republican Party 
symbol -- carted video cameras and waved American flags. 
</P>
<P>
In Century City, 1,500 Nixon friends and admirers gathered inside the Century 
Plaza, while outside the hotel, more than 300 protesters crowded Avenue of the 
Stars for a loud demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Representing an array of causes, they chanted "Stop GOP Death Squads" and 
decried malathion spraying and antiabortion legislation. Placards included 
"Republican Leaders Fail People With AIDS" and "Stop the U.S. War in El 
Salvador." Fourteen people, including Ted Hayes, an advocate for the homeless, 
were arrested for trespassing and failure to disperse. The demonstration ended 
shortly after 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction among the arriving dinner guests was mixed. George Tassios, a Los 
Angeles engineer, said the protesters should be sprayed with water cannons 
filled with indelible ink. But Buck Johns, an Orange County developer and GOP 
fund-raiser, was more sanguine. "That's fun," he said. "It's America."

ROSE GETS 5-MONTH PRISON TERM FOR CHEATING ON TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel acknowledged Pete Rose as a baseball 
legend but said Thursday in Cincinnati that he was sentencing "Pete Rose, the 
individual, who appears today convicted of two counts of cheating on his taxes" 
to five months in prison and three months in a halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, 49, the career leader in hits with 4,256 in 24 major league seasons, also 
was fined $50,000 and ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community service with 
inner-city youngsters during his one-year probation after release from the 
Ashland, Ky., prison. 
</P>
<P>
He had pleaded guilty April 20 to two counts of failing to report $354,968 in 
income from the sale of autographs, memorabilia and gambling winnings between 
1984 and 1987, a time in which he paid more than $2 million in income tax on 
reported income of $4.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The charges carried a maximum of six years in prison and a $500,000 fine. The 
judge's decision is in line with federal sentencing guidelines, which recommend 
jail time for the offenses. He acknowledged Rose's notoriety for making him an 
example in meting out justice in a courtroom in Rose's hometown, a few blocks 
from Riverfront Stadium, where Rose set records while playing for the Reds. He 
was the manager of the team when he was banned from baseball Aug. 24, 1989 for 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
"I have concluded that Mr. Rose must serve some time in a prison setting for 
his crime in order to maintain respect for the law and as a deterrent to others 
who might consider cheating on their taxes," Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
He recommended the sentence begin Aug. 10 and released Rose on his own 
recognizance. Spiegel offered Rose more time, if needed, after he limped into 
and out of the courtroom with torn knee cartilage suffered last weekend while 
playing stickball at a family reunion. Rose will undergo surgery today to 
repair the knee. 
</P>
<P>
Before being sentenced, Rose stood before Spiegel and, with voice wavering, 
acknowledged his plight and his fault for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very shameful to be here today in front of you," Rose told Spiegel. "I 
think I'm perceived as a very aggressive, arrogant type of individual. But I 
want people to know that I do have emotion, I do have feelings and I can be 
hurt like everybody else. . . . I lost my dignity, I lost my self-respect, I 
lost a lot of dear fans and almost lost some very dear friends . . . . I really 
have no excuses because it's all my fault." 
</P>
<P>
Rose is eligible to appeal to Commissioner Fay Vincent for reinstatement to 
baseball on Aug. 24, but he has indicated that he will not do so at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's sentence was the climax to 18 months in which Rose has gone from 
legend to convicted felon, blaming the fall on a gambling addiction for which 
he is being treated. 
</P>
<P>
The process began on Jan. 25, 1989, when Arnold C. Metz signed for two winning 
Pik-Six tickets at Turfway Park in Newport, Ky. It was rumored that one of the 
winners was Rose, then manager of the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
From that point through Thursday, his status in the game's lore has been 
debated, with the chief question likely to be answered in January, 1992, upon 
Rose's eligibility for the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"History and the tincture of time will decide his place among the all-time 
greats of baseball," Spiegel said. "With regard to Pete Rose, the individual, 
he has broken the law, admitted his guilt and stands ready to pay the penalty." 
</P>
<P>
After the sentence was pronounced, Rose spoke only of the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I will serve my sentence, pay my debt to society and get on with my life," he 
said in a release through spokeswoman Barbara Pinzka.

BUSINESS FEES TO BE RAISED IN NATIONAL PARKS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: INTERIOR SECRETARY LUJAN ANNOUNCES PLAN TO INCREASE LICENSING 
PRICES FOR CONCESSIONAIRES. THE CHANGE WOULD GIVE GOVERNMENT MORE REVENUE AND 
MORE CONTROL OVER PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Businesses operating inside the country's national parks will soon be paying 
more for the privilege, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said Thursday in 
announcing a new policy to negotiate higher fees from concessionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said he would like to see the average franchise fee at least double from 
the current average of 2.5% of gross receipts. Some concessionaires, he said, 
may have to pay as much as 20% to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not looking to break anyone," Lujan said, but added that 
concessionaires will now be expected to pay a "fair and equitable" fee. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy is designed to increase government revenues and control over 
profitable businesses, like the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., that operate 
inside national parks. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, Yosemite Park &amp; Curry, which enjoys the lowest 
franchise rate in the country, paid $635,000 to the federal government from 
proceeds of $84.7 million. Currently, 562 businesses collect gross revenues of 
$500 million and pay the federal government $12.5 million in franchise and user 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very well satisfied with the system, I'm just not satisfied with the 
(financial) return," Lujan said. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said he hopes some of the increased revenues might be reinvested in the 
parks, but that would require new federal legislation. Concessionaires' 
contracts come up for renewal at various times and are negotiated separately. 
</P>
<P>
The government will also encourage more competitive bidding for the 
concessions, Lujan said, by restricting concessionaires' preferential right of 
renewal for contracts and by using private sector analysts to review the bids. 
Lujan said that he also plans to shorten the terms of the contracts, some of 
which run for as long as 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he would ask Congress to enact legislation that would make it 
easier for the Park Service to acquire facilities by eliminating 
concessionaires' "possessory interest" in facilities they build or improve on 
park property. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the concessionaires said that they were "disappointed and 
surprised" by the secretary's announcement, while environmentalists said the 
policy should go even further. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that this is not good in the end either for the national parks, for 
the concessionaires or for the American public," said Allan Howe, spokesman for 
the Conference of National Park Concessioners. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said that, although consumer prices within the parks are not likely to 
rise as a result of the new policy, "There may come a point where businesses 
ask if it is worth it for them to continue to operate at all." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that all normal business activities -- including setting prices 
-- must be approved by the National Park Service. "These are exclusive 
businesses," Howe said, "but the price for that is that they are tightly 
controlled businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups welcomed the steps but stressed that legislative action is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need is a legislative overhaul that will allow the Park Service to 
protect natural resources instead of being blocked by the business interests of 
the concessionaires," said George T. Frampton, president of the Wilderness 
Society. 
</P>

In December, Lujan placed a moratorium on renewals of concession contracts 
until a task force he had established had reviewed the entire system of 
national park concessions. The new policy largely adopts the task force 
recommendations, which were released in April, and reflects concerns included 
in an Interior Department inspector general's report this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan announced that he would lift the moratorium and that the department would 
go to work renegotiating the concessions renewals currently on hold.

The federal government will allow campers to come ashore on Santa Rosa Island 
for the first time this fall, At the same time, hunters will be killing as many 
as 4,000 wild pigs. 
</P>
<P>
No campers have been allowed on the island since the National Park Service 
bought it in 1986. But beginning sometime this fall, 30 campers at a time will 
be permitted to pitch tents on a grassy plateau on the island's southeast side 
and hike in specified areas. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, hunters will be shooting the feral pigs that have ravaged the island 
digging up roots, eating acorns and plundering birds' nests since European 
settlers abandoned the swine there in 1850, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The eradication effort, to be carried out by biologists and Park Service 
rangers, is the first step in a plan to restore most of the island to its 
natural state and to turn it into a rustic resort for up to 500 vactioners by 
the year 2011. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll make sure hunters and campers won't mix," said Mack Shaver, park 
superintendent. "I don't think we'll have so many people that that will be a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Campers arriving by boat or landing at the island's airstrip will be welcomed 
by a ranger and directed to the Water Canyon campground -- away from areas 
where the hunters will be working, Shaver said. 
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the campground marks the beginning of what Shaver and his 
colleagues hope will become a "backcountry operation" on the second-largest of 
the five Channel Islands owned at least partially by the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
If proposals are approved as expected by federal officials next year, the 
island eventually will become a haven for tourists with a taste for rustic 
vacations. Visitors would be able to ride horses, kayak, tour a research and 
environmental center and stay in a no-frills bed-and-breakfast inn. 
Unrestricted camping and backpacking also would be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Park Service officials want to develop only about 100 acres of the 53,000-acre 
island and plan to maintain the vintage barns of a ranch on the northeast 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
None of the island's dirt roads would be paved under the plan, and workers 
would commute daily to the island by boat. 
</P>
<P>
"Rugged types" will enjoy the services most, Shaver said. "It's truly a 
backcountry island. On Santa Barbara and Anacapa islands, you can hear the 
ocean all the time and not forget you're on an island. Here, you can wander 
back into a canyon and get the feeling you're on a continent." 
</P>
<P>
But at least 90% of the island has been ravaged by the pigs, said Kate 
Faulkner, chief of resources management for the Park Service. They have dug up 
the roots and eaten the acorns from acres of island oaks, contaminated streams 
with their feces and preyed on native ground-nesting birds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of trees and other vegetation has resulted in severe erosion, said 
Bill Halvorson, a Park Service scientist. On higher clefts of the gray rocks 
that stud the craggy island, buckwheat and bright yellow coreopsis flowers 
grow. The flowers should carpet the canyon walls, but they grow only in steep 
areas where the pigs cannot get at them, Halvorson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service will spend between $200,000 and $800,000 over the next three 
years to wipe out the pigs under a state mandate to restore native wildlife on 
the island. In late August, Park Service employees will be flown in from Hawaii 
to train local rangers, who will be taught to look for the pigs from 
helicopters and shoot them from the ground.

JUDGE'S ACTION BLOCKS CAR INSURANCE REBATES; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 103: COMMISSIONER ROXANI GILLESPIE IS FREE TO ALLOW FIRMS TO INCREASE 
THEIR RATES, BUT ANY REFUNDS ARE PROBABLY YEARS AWAY. 
</P>

<P>
After the latest court proceedings in the protracted legal battle over 
Proposition 103, Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie is free to grant the 
state's auto insurers a round of rate increases beginning in August, but seems 
to be indefinitely blocked from telling the companies to rebate any excessive 
premiums they collected in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Three times in the last year, Gillespie has, with considerable fanfare, 
declared that she was ready to order within weeks rebates for 1989 premiums in 
accord with Proposition 103 rollback provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Her latest such pronouncement came June 13, when the commissioner said any 
company having a 1989 rate of return in excess of 11.2% would be subject to 
rebate orders beginning this month. Those could range up to the full 20% 
rollback called for in the initiative for that year, plus 10% interest. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings to determine specific rebates by company were scheduled to begin 
Wednesday. But that was before Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs 
intervened. 
</P>
<P>
Janavs last week told a lawyer for Gillespie that unless the commissioner held 
up these hearings voluntarily, she would order her to do so, pending a July 30 
hearing in which a number of insurers are asking for an injunction against the 
rebate hearings. The insurers claim that they are entitled to a greater rate of 
return than 11.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Indicating that she was leaning heavily toward issuing the injunction, Janavs 
said she believed that the courts should determine whether Gillespie's 
standards were fair before the commissioner was allowed to implement them. 
Recognizing that with court appeals this could take a long time, Janavs said 
she believed that any rebates were years away. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Janavs said Gillespie is free to begin hearings Aug. 
8 on applications by companies for approval of new, higher rates for the 
future. For the new rates, Gillespie has set a much higher limit on annual 
company rates of return, saying they could range as high as 19%. 
</P>
<P>
After the Janavs hearing, Gillespie dropped Proposition 103 rate rollback 
regulations she had promulgated last month, before they could be formally 
approved by the state Office of Administrative Law, an indication that she too 
believes that any rebate of premiums is receding into the distant future. 
</P>
<P>
One effect of the Janavs rulings is likely to be a continued legal impasse over 
implementing key phases of Proposition 103 well beyond Gillespie's term of 
office, which ends in January. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the elected commissioner scheduled to take office then, either 
Democrat John Garamendi or Republican Wes Bannister, conceivably could drop 
Gillespie's standards altogether and set up his own. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year ago, Gillespie promised to have all her rollback rebate 
decisions made by last Nov. 8. With protracted hearings on standards and legal 
challenges from insurers, she has not been able to make a decision for even a 
single company eight months after her deadline passed. 
</P>
<P>
As Proposition 103, approved by the electorate two years ago, remains in legal 
limbo, the initiative's author, Harvey Rosenfield, on Thursday formally 
launched his second attempt to qualify a new initiative that would establish a 
state-run, nonprofit auto insurance company in California to replace the 
private auto insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Rosenfield failed to qualify such an initiative for the 
November ballot, when it was in the form of a constitutional amendment 
requiring 595,000 petition signatures of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is trying for the June, 1992, ballot, but the initiative no longer would 
amend the state Constitution, only the Insurance Code. This requires obtaining 
372,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The state-run company would be formed in 1993, but only if the private 
companies failed to reduce their rates in accord with Proposition 103 rollback 
standards, adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield said Thursday that he has put 280 canvassers in the field for the 
summer and fall in an attempt to qualify the new initiative.

BAY AREA QUAKE ESTIMATE RAISED; 
</P>
<P>
DISASTERS: FEDERAL EXPERTS NOW PUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A MAGNITUDE 7 TEMBLOR 
WITHIN 30 YEARS AT 67%.

<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey on Thursday sharply increased its estimate of the 
chance that a major life-threatening earthquake could occur during the next 30 
years in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
In a study spawned by last October's 7.1-magnitude earthquake, the U.S. 
Geological Survey said there is a 67% probability that a temblor of magnitude 7 
or greater will occur in the San Francisco area within the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Put another way, a quake the size of the one last October is "twice as likely 
to occur as to not occur" in the Bay Area between now and the year 2020, said 
Peter Ward, a geophysicist for the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, earthquake experts thought that a quake as large as the Oct. 17, 
1989, Loma Prieta shaker had a 50-50 chance of occurring over the next 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
William Ellsworth, a USGS geophysicist who worked on the study, emphasized that 
even the new estimate is "conservative," and suggested the probability of a 
major quake is even greater than 67%. 
</P>
<P>
He also repeated geologists' belief that the Bay Area has entered a renewed era 
of heavy seismic activity. The Loma Prieta earthquake was the first major quake 
(7 or greater) since 1911 in the San Francisco area. Such temblors occurred at 
a rate of one every 10 years during the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said a "manpower" shortage has prevented the U.S. Geological Survey from 
performing a similar analysis in the seismically active areas of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
But the report pointed out that given the same type of detailed analysis, the 
probability of a major quake in, for example, San Bernardino, most likely would 
increase as well. 
</P>
<P>
Geologists revised their estimate of the quake threat in the Bay Area after 
concluding that the land masses on each side of two major faults are moving 
faster than previously thought. One of the faults is the Hayward, which runs 
under East Bay cities. The other fault is the section of the San Andreas that 
runs up the San Francisco Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the revision is that geologists took a new look at the 
Rodgers Creek Fault, which runs from San Pablo Bay to Santa Rosa, and concluded 
that it has generated earthquakes far stronger than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
A final factor is the belief that last year's quake on the section of the San 
Andreas Fault in the Santa Cruz Mountains area known as Loma Prieta increased 
the stress on the San Andreas closer to the Bay Area population center. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake experts renewed their plea that more money be spent on earthquake 
safety. USGS officials said they plan to distribute more than 2 million copies 
of a magazine next month in the Bay Area detailing how people can prepare for 
the next quake. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do in the next several months and years is going to change the outcome 
of the next event," Richard K. Eisner, of the state Office of Emergency 
Services, said at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"If we ignore the threat, if we don't take it seriously and we don't commit the 
resources to strengthening the older buildings, we're essentially saying, 'Yes, 
people will die unnecessarily.' " 
</P>
<P>
Without major preparation, the geologists believe a quake on the Hayward, 
Rodgers or peninsula section of the San Andreas could result in far more 
destruction than was wrought by the Loma Prieta quake. The Loma Prieta quake 
hit in a relatively isolated spot 60 miles south of San Francisco and Oakland, 
yet resulted in 62 deaths and $6 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
The new analysis contained no new estimate of the loss of life from a slip 
along one of the major faults. But a 1987 study by the state estimated that 
1,500 to 4,500 people would die should a quake of magnitude 7.5 strike on the 
Hayward Fault. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said an earthquake of 7 magnitude on the Hayward Fault would result in 
shaking 12 times stronger in Oakland than was caused by the Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland, where several downtown buildings remain unsafe because of quake 
damage, was the site of the greatest loss of life in the Oct. 17 quake. The 
quake caused a section of the Nimitz Freeway to collapse, killing 41 people. 
</P>
<P>
A quake on the San Francisco Peninsula section of the San Andreas would result 
in shaking at least five times stronger in the city than resulted from the Loma 
Prieta quake. The effects on areas such as the Marina District, where unstable 
ground experienced liquefaction, would be even worse. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to estimating that there is a 67% probability of a magnitude 7 or 
greater quake in the next 30 years, the analysis noted that there is a 50% 
chance of such a quake during the next 20 years, and a 33% chance of one in the 
next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The new analysis is a revision to an estimate issued in 1988. Then, the USGS 
estimated there was a 50% chance that a major quake would hit within 30 years, 
a 30% chance of one in 20 years, and a 20% of one within 10 years.

SANDINISTAS RALLY TO MARK 11TH ANNIVERSARY OF SOMOZA'S OUSTER; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: CHAMORRO GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS SPECIAL SHOWS ON TELEVISION IN A BID TO 
KEEP THE CROWDS DOWN.

<P>
The war is over, but the battles go on. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas, celebrating the 11th anniversary of the triumph of the 
revolution they led, mounted a boisterous, song-filled rally Thursday with 
firebrand former President Daniel Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
"Not one step back," they cried. 
</P>
<P>
To discourage the masses from attending, the government bought out its big 
guns: special July 19 programming on state television, including "Batman," 
"Crocodile Dundee" and "Three Men and a Baby." 
</P>
<P>
This is not a new tactic. Earlier in the year, to counter a campaign rally for 
the National Opposition Union, the Sandinistas had aired "Rain Man." They lost 
the election anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Sandinistas are the opposition, searching for a new identity and a 
political battle plan to use against the conservative government. 
</P>
<P>
"The Revolution Continues. . . . Not One Step Back," a headline announced in 
the anniversary issue of Barricada, the Sandinista newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
A headline in President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's La Prensa responded, 
"July 19, the Sandinistas' First Expropriation." 
</P>
<P>
For a decade under Sandinista rule, the opposition had to fight to get on 
television -- and it usually lost. Today it is the Sandinistas who are not seen 
on television. They say the government refuses to sell them air time. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro addressed the nation on the eve of the anniversary. It was the 1978 
assassination of her husband, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, that sparked a popular 
uprising that, with the Sandinistas in the vanguard, ousted dictator Anastasio 
Somoza on July 19, 1979, ending 43 years of rule by the Somoza family. The 
Sandinista guerrillas, organized in 1961 to oppose the Somoza dynasty, did not 
figure in Chamorro's address. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro, who sat with Ortega and others on the first post-Somoza junta, said: 
"Unfortunately, the revolution was confiscated by an exclusive party with a 
totalitarian ideology that they had kept hidden. In place of democracy, a 
dictatorship rose up like a cadaver on its feet." 
</P>
<P>
She said this at a time when members of her coalition are accusing her of being 
a closet Sandinista. The charge refers to the negotiated settlement of last 
week's violent nationwide strike. In effect, the settlement, among other 
things, puts on hold her government's plans to sell off state lands and 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
While some government officials quietly prayed for a tropical rainstorm, the 
Sandinistas invited all Nicaraguans, regardless of party affiliation, to their 
rally. They even invited Chamorro, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the government and the president recognize this date," 
Sandinista Comandante Jaime Wheelock said. "The Sandinistas led the people in a 
struggle by all Nicaraguans." 
</P>
<P>
No one from Chamorro's government showed up, and it poured rain, but the 
Sandinistas turned out 50,000 supporters. The crowd sang Sandinista songs, 
clearly energized by the results of their strike. 
</P>
<P>
"Down with decrees that confiscat from the people," their banners read. 
</P>
<P>
The government had been uncertain how to deal with July 19: Some officials did 
not want to concede the day to the Sandinistas, and others wanted to ignore it. 
They feared a clash between Sandinistas and government supporters, as in last 
week's strike, which left four dead and dozens wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, officials realized they could not avoid a national holiday; after all, 
it is spelled out in the constitution and the labor code. So they gave public 
employees the day off but planned no festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to compete or to appear as if we were trying to steal their 
show," said Antonio Ibarra, vice minister of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Police said there were no reports of violence. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, July 19 has served as a platform for the Sandinistas to flex 
their muscles at the United States and the U.S.-backed Contra war. Cuban 
President Fidel Castro spoke at the first anniversary celebration, and the U.S. 
delegation walked out as the crowd sang the Sandinista anthem, which contains a 
line condemning American "enemies of humanity." 
</P>
<P>
At several July 19 celebrations, the Sandinistas put on a display of military 
might, with marching soldiers and militia, tanks, helicopters and aircraft. Now 
they do not officially command the military, although Chamorro left Ortega's 
brother, Gen. Humberto Ortega, in place as chief of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
The themes of past celebrations were national sovereignty, nonintervention and 
victory over the Contras. With the war behind them and a stunning electoral 
defeat, the themes of this rally were democracy and defending the gains of the 
revolution against Chamorro's program of free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"If barricades were raised, it was to defend the rights of workers to work, or 
farmers to farm the land," Ortega said. "That is why there was a national 
strike." 
</P>
<P>
Added Wheelock in an interview: "We have simply lost an election here, but the 
revolution is a general fact. Thanks to the revolution, Violeta Chamorro is 
president." 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro does not see it quite that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from the vote that elected me president," Chamorro said. 
</P>
<P>
The rally highlighted the dilemma the Sandinistas face. They began as a 
guerrilla army fighting a dictator and, once in power, formed a party to 
support their government. Now they must convert that political-military 
organization into a party with mass appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's strike, while successful in its political goals, frightened many 
people with its guerrilla-like tactics.

New fighting between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks in Soviet Central Asia has 
increased the death toll to 212, and incidents of "sadistic cruelty" have taken 
place, state media reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna said about 1,200 people have been hospitalized 
from violence since early June. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 204 people had been reported killed in the fighting, which broke 
out June 4 in western Kirghizia in a land dispute between the ethnic groups, 
both largely Sunni Muslims who speak Turkic dialects. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said Thursday, "Reports are still coming in of fights, arson and pogroms. 
Passing cars are being stoned. Barricades are being built." 
</P>
<P>
Tensions had eased during 40 days of mourning for those killed in the June 
fighting, but violence flared again this week.

Iraq's bellicose Saddam Hussein, bolstered Thursday by a parliamentary proposal 
that he be elected president for life, has shaken his Persian Gulf neighbors 
with threats and accusations just before a price-setting meeting of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
Chedli Klibi, secretary general of the Tunis-based Arab League, flew to Kuwait 
for talks with officials of the oil-rich sheikdom, which was accused by Iraqi 
officials of stealing oil, territorial aggression and driving down petroleum 
prices in a campaign "inspired by America to undermine Arab interests and 
security." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait countered Thursday with a letter to the Arab League denying the Iraqi 
accusations and declaring, in turn, that "Iraq has a rich record in its 
violations of Kuwaiti territory." 
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iraq and the Persian Gulf oil states of Kuwait and the United 
Arab Emirates have been strained for months as over-quota production by the two 
smaller states has glutted world oil markets, driving down the per-barrel price 
that Iraq and other exporters get for their petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
A recent pledge by Kuwait and the Emirates to stay within their OPEC-assigned 
quotas apparently did not satisfy Hussein, whose oil minister is expected to 
push for a higher target price at next Wednesday's OPEC meeting in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
The bombastic Iraqi leader, speaking Tuesday in Baghdad before a political 
gathering marking the 11th anniversary of his ascension to power, threatened 
unnamed overproducers with violence if they do not rein in their exports. 
</P>
<P>
Calling on God to witness "we have warned them," Hussein said, "If words fail 
to protect Iraqis, something effective must be done to return things to their 
natural course. . . ." At one point he told his responsive audience, "Iraqis 
will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better than cutting means of 
living." 
</P>
<P>
Coming from the man who last spring threatened to "burn half of Israel" with 
chemical weapons if attacked by Israeli "mass-destruction" weapons, Tuesday's 
warning was closely examined by Middle East analysts and government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Some key gulf newspapers, including Kuwait's Al Qabas and the Saudi Arabian 
daily Ash Sharq al Awsat, downplayed or ignored Hussein's remarks, but the 
Kuwaiti government showed its concern by dispatching diplomats to key Arab 
capitals to seek support for its case. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak reportedly 
telephoned Kuwaiti and Iraqi officials to try to defuse the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baghdad newspapers reported Thursday that the Iraqi Parliament voted 
Wednesday to make the presidency, to be filled in a proposed election this 
year, a for-life job. Hussein, who vowed that the election would demonstrate 
democratic values in Iraq, has said he would be a candidate. No one else has 
stepped forward in a country where political challenges to the president have 
resulted in mysterious deaths or disappearances. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's remarks this week were backed by a long letter of complaint, written 
by Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz and delivered to the Arab League, about 
the oil practices of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
As reported by the official Iraqi news agency, the Aziz letter accused Kuwait 
of occupying Iraqi territory, an action it charged was tantamount to "military 
aggression"; of stealing Iraqi oil by tapping into the Rumaila field from the 
Kuwaiti side of the border, and of driving down oil prices by overproduction, 
which Aziz charged, has cost Iraq $89 billion in lost revenue over the last 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi outburst brought a quick pledge of support from Washington for its 
small Persian Gulf allies. A State Department spokesman told reporters, 
"Clearly, we're strongly committed to supporting the individual and collective 
self-defense of our friends in the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Iraq have a longstanding border dispute, and Baghdad clearly covets 
some Kuwaiti islands at the top of the gulf. As a major oil producer with 
reserves reputedly second only to Saudi Arabia's, Iraq has always been troubled 
by its short gulf coastline -- less than 40 miles -- from which to ship its 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts suggested that Baghdad's bitter accusations were designed 
primarily to prepare the ground for the OPEC meeting in Geneva, to round up 
support among other producers to hold Kuwait and the Emirates to their quotas 
and to drive up the price of oil by raising fears of instability in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But with a well-trained, well-equipped army of 1 million, Iraq has turned 
itself after its long war with Iran into the powerhouse of the Persian Gulf -- 
and when Hussein threatens violence, his remarks are not dismissed as bluster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is to meet next Wednesday in 
Geneva. The oil ministers are expected to fix an official, combined production 
ceiling and possibly a new reference price for the remainder of 1990. The 
reference price is the average for all the different grades of crude oil pumped 
by the 13 member states. OPEC has predicted its base reference price will "soar 
above and beyond" its current $18 a barrel after the conference. But market 
analysts say the conference could be contentious.

Blacks are more optimistic about South Africa's future than whites as a result 
of President Frederik W. de Klerk's racial reforms, according to an independent 
poll released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Markinor Gallup poll, conducted in May, also said 43% of blacks questioned 
said De Klerk was leading the country very well but only 27% of whites agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Only 4% of blacks had no confidence in De Klerk's leadership, while 14% of 
whites said they had no confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed more than 50% of blacks believe the relationship between 
blacks and whites is improving, while only 31% of whites think so. Just 21% of 
blacks believe the relationship is deteriorating, compared to 46% of whites, 
according to the poll, based on nationwide interviews with 1,500 blacks and 800 
whites.

EPA LIMITS USE OF PESTICIDE THAT KILLS BIRDS

In an unprecedented action to protect birds, the Environmental Protection 
Agency on Thursday banned the use of the pesticide diazinon on golf courses and 
sod farms. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials said the order is based on reports of about 60 incidents of 
massive bird kills in 18 states in which diazinon was confirmed or implicated 
as the main cause. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-year legal fight, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly issued an 
order barring continued use of diazinon, marking the first time the agency has 
revoked government approval of a pesticide solely because of its harmful 
effects on birds. 
</P>
<P>
Diazinon, primarily produced by Ciba-Geigy, is widely used to control a variety 
of insects at agricultural and ornamental nursery sites and around homes and 
gardens. About 8 million pounds are used annually. 
</P>
<P>
The pesticide has not been used on golf courses or sod farms since March, 1988, 
after an initial EPA order banning the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
That order was subsequently contested by Ciba-Geigy in legal action and was 
sent back to the EPA for reconsideration in 1989 by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court 
of Appeals.

PANEL WILL URGE REPRIMAND FOR FRANK; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS: MASSACHUSETTS LAWMAKER IS REPORTEDLY BEING GIVEN THE LEAST PUNITIVE 
SANCTION BY HOUSE COMMITTEE FOR HIS TIES TO A MALE PROSTITUTE.

<P>
The House Ethics Committee has decided to recommend that the House reprimand 
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) for actions related to his relationship with a male 
prostitute, congressional sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, which will be announced today, was unanimous among the 11 members 
of the 12-member ethics panel who were present. Rep. Larry E. Craig (R-Ida.) 
was out of town Thursday, but he was expected to agree with the recommendation 
to reprimand Frank, one of two openly homosexual members of the House. 
</P>
<P>
A reprimand is the least punitive of the official sanctions that the committee 
can recommend, but it must be put to a vote by the full House. Other more 
serious official sanctions that require a House vote are censure and expulsion. 
A vote on the Frank punishment is expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Frank said he would have no comment on the issue until the 
Ethics Committee releases its report today. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to recommend a reprimand centers on two actions Frank took on 
behalf of the prostitute, Stephen L. Gobie, a convicted felon who was living in 
Frank's home. Frank acknowledged that he fixed parking tickets Gobie received 
while driving Frank's car and that he wrote letters on his congressional 
letterhead to court officials supervising Gobie's probation from his conviction 
on drug and sodomy charges. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding to recommend a reprimand, the committee broke a months-long logjam 
over the controversial case, which has been before the ethics panel since last 
September. Committee Democrats had persistently sought to resolve the case by 
issuing only a letter of reproval to Frank, but several GOP members of the 
panel resisted, holding out for a stronger sanction that would require action 
by the House. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats on the committee ultimately gave in, sources said, to break the 
deadlock and prevent a bruising floor fight in which their party could be 
portrayed as defending homosexual conduct. Democrats believed that the House 
would have ultimately increased the sanction from a letter of reproval to at 
least a reprimand in any case and that it was better to deny conservative 
Republicans a divisive election-year issue. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Democrats favoring a letter of reproval had some GOP support 
on the panel, but ultimately preferred not to issue a split decision that would 
invite a battle to toughen the sanction on the floor. The recommendation, one 
source said, "is much stronger now than if it were divided." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) has said he will ask the House to 
expel Frank once the Ethics Committee concludes its investigation. A spokesman 
for Dannemeyer said the Californian intends to make that motion, but Democrats 
believe they can derail it and sustain a reprimand on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Frank's relationship with Gobie was disclosed last August in the Washington 
Times. Frank then acknowledged that he had had a brief sexual relationship with 
Gobie and hired him with personal funds to serve as an aide for a period of 
about 18 months. Frank said he had hired Gobie in hopes of helping him to lead 
a better life. 
</P>
<P>
But Frank vehemently denied that he had sanctioned the use of his Capitol Hill 
apartment by Gobie for prostitution, saying that he had fired Gobie after 
discovering that he had used his home for prostitution. Though the Ethics 
Committee received some testimony alleging that Frank permitted Gobie to use 
his home for prostitution, witnesses, including Frank's landlady, disputed the 
charge and the panel did not find it to be credible, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, a leading liberal Democrat in the House, has remained influential in the 
House Democratic Caucus and faces a relatively weak reelection challenge this 
fall in his Massachusetts district.

TESTIMONY BLOW TO PROSECUTION IN N.Y. JOGGER CASE

A police criminologist testified Thursday that none of the hair found on the 
Central Park jogger belonged to any of the three youths on trial for the 
gang-rape and beating of the woman last year. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony from Nicholas Petraco, a retired police detective, marked a blow 
for the prosecution, which has also failed to link the three suspects to the 
crime through blood and semen tests. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have said the results of the previous tests suggested that 
the rapist was still at large. 
</P>
<P>
Bolstering that speculation, Petraco testified that some stray hair found on 
the jogger failed to match samples taken from the woman and the three 
defendants, Antron McCray, 16, Raymond Santana, 15, and Yusef Salaam, 16. 
</P>
<P>
But Petraco, a police lab expert for 22 years, told the jury in state Supreme 
Court in Manhattan that light-colored pubic and head hair similar to the 
jogger's was found on the clothing of Kevin Richardson, a youth who is awaiting 
trial in the case.

It might have been billed as Richard M. Nixon's day, but the accolades were 
piled just as high for his wife, Pat, during a morning of speeches at the 
dedication of her husband's library. 
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old former First Lady made one of her rare public appearances since 
a helicopter lifted the Nixons from the White House lawn the day after the 
President resigned in August, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Time and various illnesses have left her frail, but she beamed Thursday as one 
speaker after another lauded her and the crowd delivered standing ovations. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a true, unsung hero of the Nixon Administration and our country owes 
her a great debt of gratitude," former President Ronald Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
"A loyal wife, a caring mother and grandmother, Pat Nixon was one of our 
nation's most gracious First Ladies. She was a superbly charming hostess, 
whether in Washington or San Clemente," Reagan added. "And she represented our 
country splendidly when she traveled abroad." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush called her "a gracious First Lady who ranks among the most 
admired women of postwar America. The woman we know, and love, as Pat." 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Nixon, the Secret Service called you 'Starlight.' Your husband has said 
it best: you 'fit that name to a T,' " Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Nixon suffered a stroke in 1976, just after reading Washington Post 
journalist Bob Woodward's book "The Final Days." She since has been 
hospitalized for several other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"She's frail . . . but she has more energy than a team of horses," said Helene 
Drown of Rolling Hills Estates, who has known Pat Nixon since they were 
teachers at a Whittier high school more than 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Drown said a few days ago that Pat Nixon, who has steadfastly stood by her 
husband, had been looking forward to the dedication. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she ever felt her husband was guilty of great crimes," she said. 
"I don't feel she's ever lost faith in her husband." 
</P>
<P>
Said Athalie Clark of Newport Beach, who loaned her Virginia farmhouse to the 
Nixons after he resigned the presidency, "I'm sure she's happy to come back to 
all this, and to hear the laurels and the accolades."

MEXICO TO SEEK EXTRADITION IN KIDNAPING

The Mexican government said it would formally request today the extradition of 
two men who allegedly plotted the kidnaping of a Guadalajara doctor accused in 
the murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique S. Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
The bulletin from the Mexican Foreign Ministry, released Thursday, also stated 
that the U.S. State Department has replied to Mexico's requests for information 
about the abduction and the return of the doctor for questioning by Mexican 
authorities. The contents of the reply were not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government, which has objected to the kidnaping of Dr. Humberto 
Alvarez Machain as an insult to its sovereignity, was said to be studying the 
reply. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican ambassador to the United States has been instructed to ask that 
U.S. authorities arrest Hector Berrellez, a Los Angeles-based Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent, and Antonio Garate Velarde, a DEA informant. 
</P>
<P>
An arrest would be the first step toward turning them over to Mexican 
authorities. Mexico's attorney general previously issued warrants for the 
arrest of the men. Six other suspects in the kidnaping, including three Mexican 
police officers, have been arrested here. 
</P>
<P>
Garate, a former Mexican police officer, said in an interview last April that 
he arranged the abduction of Alvarez in Guadalajara on April 2 and his delivery 
to three Los Angeles-based DEA agents who were waiting in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Garate claimed that the operation was approved by Berellez, who headed the 
investigation into the torture and murder of Camarena in Guadalajara and was 
one of the agents who arrested Alvarez in El Paso. Berellez has refused to 
comment on Garate's account of the kidnaping and other DEA agents have said he 
was not aware of the details of the Alvarez kidnaping until after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
DEA agents had long sought Alvarez, who allegedly administered drugs to revive 
Camarena, permitting drug traffickers to torture him further. In 1985, Camarena 
was kidnaped off the streets of Guadalajara. His mutilated body was found 
several weeks later, and a massive manhunt for his killers was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen people, including drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero, have been 
convicted in Mexico for their involvement in the murder. Mexican authorities 
reopened the case in May, shortly after the trial of four suspects in the 
killing opened in Los Angeles.

Capping a week of court rulings that got vital payments flowing despite the 
state's record-breaking budget deadlock, a federal judge Thursday ordered the 
state to release $539 million to providers of medical and social services -- 
including hard-pressed in-home care workers. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a request by a state employees union and a nonprofit legal 
foundation, U.S. District Judge Jack E. Tanner issued a temporary restraining 
order in Sacramento that forces the state to release $489 million in Medi-Cal 
funds to thousands of hospitals, doctors and pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
He also ordered the payment of $50 million to 134,000 people who provide 
in-home care for the elderly and disabled and who have not been paid in more 
than a month. Before the court ruling, many had reported being down to their 
last few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Many home-care workers, who clustered inside the federal courtroom Thursday, 
welcomed Tanner's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope we get the checks soon," said Genie Scott, who receives $499 a 
month to take care of a 91-year-old woman. "It's been hard. We've been . . . 
getting by day by day." 
</P>
<P>
Katrina Wash, an in-home worker who is supposed to receive $263 a month, said 
she had been unable to afford even a bus ride since she stopped receiving her 
state paycheck. But she said it's been even tougher for the two 90-year-old men 
she cares for. "They're helpless. If I can't provide for them, they're going to 
die," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis, who supported the legal action, said that without the 
court ruling he would not have been able to release the funds until the 
Legislature and governor adopt a state budget for the fiscal year that began 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
When the judge's ruling was announced at 11 a.m., Davis was in the Assembly 
chamber, where lawmakers were meeting to vote on a series of budget bills. 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) announced the ruling and told Davis: 
"Now you can make the payments." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ruling came a week after a similar action by another federal judge, 
who ordered the state to release $149 million in welfare funds. Earlier this 
week, a Sacramento County Superior Court judge ordered the state to release 
$330 million in Medi-Cal funds to hospitals and nursing homes by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner's order, which releases all of the Medi-Cal funds immediately, 
apparently supersedes the Superior Court ruling. "I want clients to get their 
services right now," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Eugene Hill had argued that the court should not intervene in 
the state budget process, but Tanner shot back: "The political process is fine, 
but for those that can't help themselves -- that's just tough. That's what 
you're saying." 
</P>
<P>
Hill said his office would appeal Tanner's ruling to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court 
of Appeals in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ruling, about $800 million, mainly to meet the state's mid-month 
payroll and obligations to local governments, remains frozen because of the 
budget impasse, according to Davis' office.

LAX DUNE SITE IS NO PEBBLE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times story (July 16) about the 302-acre remnant of the El Segundo Dunes 
west of Los Angeles International Airport was excellent, but it didn't go far 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
First, most of the area proposed by LAX for a golf course is incredibly noisy 
and not necessarily a safe place for outdoor recreation. Heavily loaded 747s 
barely make it over the dunes during takeoff, and their roaring jet engines 
come close to being intolerable. Hundreds of airplane parts have been picked up 
in the area, which should indicate to any reasonable person that there are more 
things to watch out for on a crowded golf course than high-flying balls. 
</P>
<P>
Second, it should be thought-provoking that the scientist who performed the 
biological survey of the dunes for the Department of Airports (LAX was required 
to do it by the state Coastal Commission) is the one who is recommending the 
preservation of a larger section of the dunes. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rudolf Mattoni's discoveries throughout most of the remnant obviously show 
there is much more to preserve and restore than LAX has been willing to 
consider. Indeed, there are species of insects and plants found no place else 
in the world that he believes may be more endangered than the El Segundo Blue 
Butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Third, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's proposal to protect more of the dunes and 
split the golf course into two parts is not only sensible but farsighted. 
Department of Airports officials, including the Board of Airport commissioners, 
have heard similar suggestions for years, but they have opposed them. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 acres on the LAX Northside Development property, east of the dunes, 
was an old, unused Nike site owned by the federal government. It was turned 
over to the airport some time ago for the token sum of $1. Since the Department 
of Airports will make a handsome profit no matter how the land is used, I can't 
think of a more appropriate location for a continuation of the proposed golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
An open recreation area under falling objects and in 100 decibels of noise can 
hardly be compared to Pebble Beach, but that's the way the airport sees it. 
Golfers deserve a safer, less-frightening place to play their games -- a place 
off to the side rather than directly beneath the takeoff pattern of the biggest 
commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
The ecosystem of the fragile dunes is irreplaceable and in need of restoration. 
The more we can preserve of this one-of-a-kind area, the better chance it has 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Galanter is on the right track.

BUILDER IN TORRANCE FEUD FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Deborah Schoch 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer who has been feuding with the city of Torrance said this week that 
Park Beyond the Park, an investment group with which he is connected, has been 
forced to file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Jerry L. Conrow, criticized the city for blocking the group's 
efforts to rent space to the Los Angeles County court system in a building the 
group developed. 
</P>
<P>
"They basically didn't want the court system to expand within Torrance, so they 
set requirements that no one could meet," said Conrow, who is general partner 
of Park Beyond the Park. Specifically, he cited a city requirement that one 
parking space be provided for every 150 square feet of floor space in any 
building used for court purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Park Beyond the Park, described by Conrow as a partnership of about 25 people, 
owns a 126,000-square-foot office building at 1880 S. Crenshaw Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The group filed a lawsuit in January claiming that the city cost it the court 
contract. A second lawsuit by Conrow, which challenged the city's review of 
parking for its cultural arts center, was dismissed in Superior Court last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Gibson, senior principal planner for the city, declined to comment on 
Conrow's criticisms because of the pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Conrow said the group filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal 
Bankruptcy Act on July 12. Deborah Schoch

JUST A FEW KIND WORDS FOR S&amp;LS; 
</P>
<P>
* LET NOT OUR FURY BLIND US TO OVERKILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hardly anybody has a kind word for the savings and loan business these days. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprising. The looting of the S&amp;L business during the 1980s will cost 
American taxpayers at least $500 billion. Now we hear that 40% of the 
institutions that went broke did so because of calculated fraud and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody who's not hopping mad about this either has got to be dead -- or under 
indictment for S&amp;L fraud. 
</P>
<P>
But it would be tragic indeed if this latest Congressional Crusade becomes one 
of those that destroys the village in order to save it. There are villains 
aplenty to be rooted out, but at the end of the day it would be to everybody's 
advantage if the good old S&amp;Ls could be returned to the way they were 
before the crooks turned them into a transcontinental scam. Consider these 
facts: 
</P>
<P>
-Savings institutions put generations of Americans into homes they could not 
have purchased any other way. 
</P>
<P>
-S&amp;Ls provided many members of minority groups with careers in finance that 
did not exist elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
-S&amp;Ls generate very close to half of all home mortgages in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the task now for Washington is complicated: It must make sure that in 
trying to make things better it does not make them worse. The truth is that 
some elements of thrift reform that drew the loudest cheers when Congress sent 
them to the White House last August seem less attractive today. 
</P>
<P>
Some need review. For instance, Congress directed the industry to make sure 
mortgage loans constituted 70% of its assets. But the real estate market is 
sluggish these days. If mortgages, generally small profit makers, turn to 
losers, the 70% directive could have the unintended effect of generating more 
S&amp;L failures. 
</P>
<P>
Another congressional directive that sounded fine at the time gives S&amp;Ls 
tight deadlines for getting rid of their junk bonds. But that can weaken a 
thrift institution because it immediately cuts the value of the junk bonds and 
the assets on which a thrift bases loans. Let's look at this one again. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is to argue for a second's delay in rooting out and prosecuting 
the looters. But the process of putting the thrift industry back in good order 
needs to be monitored closely so that bad ideas can be spotted before they do 
real damage. 
</P>
<P>
For example, outrage is the proper response to a discovery that 40% of the 
S&amp;Ls seized so far failed because of fraud. Turn the statistic around, 
though, and it says that fewer than half of the seized S&amp;Ls failed because 
their managers turned to piracy the first chance they got. Appropriate 
regulation is critical. Both Congress and the Executive Branch share 
responsibility for the orgy of deregulation that made looting of the thrifts 
possible. Wisdom concerning this crisis begins with the admission that for 
every federal regulation that is a weight "on the back" of the people, there's 
one that stands between the people and harm.

BLACK CHARGES OF JEWISH RACISM IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is unfortunate that my statements as a panelist for the NAACP on 
Afro-American film and marketing distribution would be taken out of context and 
cause adverse reaction from Jewish people (Metro, July 11-12). 
</P>
<P>
My statement, in response to a question I was asked about the Jewish 
entertainment business, was: "I'm sure when the Jews set up their business they 
didn't set it up for you, they set it up to make money from their perspective 
of what would make a successful business, and if we had set it up we would have 
done the same thing." (Writing half of this statement takes it out of context.) 
</P>
<P>
I went on to say that we have got to stop worrying about what "other" people 
are and are not doing and start worrying and talking about what we are going to 
do. If we don't like the films and TV shows that are being made, don't watch 
them. Assault weapons are being brought into our neighborhoods and our children 
are buying them not because they want to be Rambo, but because they want the 
power and they want to feel important. Criminal behavior is being imitated 
because it is glorified on the screen and we support it. The children belong to 
all of us. We must help them instead of ignoring them. 
</P>
<P>
God is the only power and each of us is made in his image. We can do anything 
we want to do. We can start our own film and distribution company. We have 
enough churches, sororities, fraternities, social and business groups to 
accomplish this. When positive films are made by blacks we do not support them. 
It's just as important to know what we want as what we don't want. 
</P>
<P>
It is time for us to take care of our own neighborhoods. Our children, our 
businesses and our communities need our support. Let's get about the business 
of our own agenda. Worrying about other people is not going to solve the 
homeless, the gangs, drugs or the unemployment problems. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that we as blacks will run the $260 billion we spend in this country 
through our community more than once and devote at least 20% of it to not only 
solving our problems but creating an economic base. 
</P>
<P>
Often good can come from a bad situation. After years of differences I hope my 
misquote can be a catalyst for Jews and blacks to come together and find common 
ground for a positive future both in and out of Hollywood.

NEW TAXES ARE PRECISELY WHAT DOCTOR DIDN'T ORDER; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THEY SAID AMERICA WASN'T SAVING ENOUGH. FACT IS, TOO MANY AMERICANS 
CAN'T AFFORD TO SPEND ANYMORE; AND THOSE WHO CAN, DON'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIOT JANEWAY, Eliot Janeway is the publisher of the Janeway Letter. His 
latest book, The Economics of Chaos on Revitalizing the American Economy, has 
just been published in paperback. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only yesterday, it seems, President Bush was pointing with pride to the 
performance of the economy. Then overnight, his apologies for its slowdown 
unsealed his lips on the sensitive subject of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Bush aired his alibi at his June 29 press conference. "We've had a much slower 
economy than anybody predicted." Therefore, as he explained, revenues have 
shrunk along with earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The President's embarrassment parallels that suffered by Gov. Michael Dukakis 
in 1988 when his "Massachusetts Miracle" collapsed into just another voodoo 
show. The Massachusetts economy went bad when retail sales went bad. Sales-tax 
collections dropped, and Dukakis' claims to fiscal responsibility were 
discredited. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush's advisers did not realize then that the failure that benefited them 
in Massachusetts would catch up with them within two years throughout the 
country. Accordingly, he has operated with no contingency plan to use once the 
national economy confirmed the evidence that it is following Massachusetts into 
a slump. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eminent economists in academe were bombarding media and 
policy-makers with warnings that America's consumers were over-borrowing and 
overspending the country into a recession -- or worse. The cure they 
recommended called for more savings, forced by taxes if necessary. The most 
articulate of them have been Democratic, specifically those taken seriously by 
Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, the reason given by the President for his retreat on taxes proves 
that this accusation is a bum rap. Indeed, he put the country on notice that it 
would be better off today if consumers had all along borrowed and spent even 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Recessions have been given a number of definitions, such as "two successive 
quarters of negative GNP." But the functional definition -- when consumers run 
out of cash, credit and nerve -- is the best and simplest. They ran out of all 
three before the 1989 Christmas shopping season. The President's complaint that 
no one around him "predicted" the slowdown that has spread since then is an 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the President's advisers also have an alibi. They have been going by 
the statistics. But to paraphrase what the President told that same press 
conference about his own job, his advisers are paid to anticipate statistics. 
Hard evidence of the slowdown has been surfacing for the better part of a year. 
Since last September, businesses and property owners have been putting up hard 
money to counter the claims of economists against supposed consumer profligacy. 
Advertising has featured bargains calculated to lure consumer dollars out of 
hiding. Quality stores routinely guarantee to meet price competition from 
anywhere. Big-ticket items are to be had for "no down payment." Banks waive 
credit scrutiny to move foreclosed homes. 
</P>
<P>
Business overconfidence about consumer spending is the direct cause of every 
economic downturn. Business managements can also offer their creditors and 
stockholders an alibi for 1990's disappointing results. They can blame them on 
the dogmatic obsession with the myth of consumer overconfidence held by their 
economic advisers. 
</P>
<P>
The economy is caught in the stalemate between those who would spend if they 
could, and those who could spend but won't. Slowly but surely, financial 
pressures from cost inflation and servicing debt have stalled or scuttled 
discretionary spending by the gainfully employed. Now, suddenly, political 
pressures have sharpened against Bush to increase Treasury collections. But 
he's missed the boat on raising taxes. Now the economy is clearly seen to be 
weakening. 
</P>
<P>
Before the end of 1989, the moneyed minority had salted away personal holdings 
of income-bearing cash reserves amounting to $2.65 trillion. The 
pre-inflationary rule of prudent budgeting called for saving 25% of annual 
income. Such a prodigious pool of idled liquidity approximates half of gross 
national product. It's a lot of made money even by Japanese or German 
standards. This accumulation challenges both the claims of economists and the 
assumptions of budget summiteers. 
</P>
<P>
Any taxes intended to cut consumption will cut revenues instead. Businesses 
already wounded by price wars cannot hope to pass on tax increases aimed at 
consumers or, to the contrary, absorb them. Tax increases speed up business 
slowdowns.

THE PEACE PROCESS FALLS FOR THE DECOYS; 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE EAST: YASSER ARAFAT COULD NOT MEET THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S CONDITIONS. 
NOW HE'S PLAYED INTO ABUL ABBAS' HANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY K. SHEINBAUM, Stanley K. Sheinbaum, publisher of New Perspectives 
Quarterly, was one of the five American Jews who met with Yasser Arafat in 
Stockholm in December, 1988. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yasser Arafat himself predicted the Palestinian terrorist assault in May on an 
Israeli beach -- or its equivalent -- a year and a half ago when at a meeting 
with five American Jews in Stockholm, he announced the Palestine Liberation 
Organization's recognition of Israel and the disavowal of terrorism. The 
Americans asked if his statements also covered the dissident rejectionist 
groups within the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before, the Palestinian National Council, the PLO's legislative arm, 
had met in Algiers and, on a 5-1 vote, authorized Arafat to take those 
positions. The intifada had erupted nearly a year earlier and he understood 
that part of its message was addressed to him -- the years of terrorism had 
achieved nothing but hatred and a new strategy was needed. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening months before Algiers and Stockholm, Arafat indefatigably 
traveled North Africa and the Middle East to lobby among the PNC members for 
support. He got all but 20%, those being the hard-liners. It was a major turn 
for the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
So in answer to our original question about the rejectionists, Arafat's 
response was clear. Right from the beginning, he said that if this dramatic 
shift produced no response from the United States and especially from Israel, 
then dissident elements under George Habash, Nayef Hawatmeh, Abul Abbas and 
others would begin to threaten his leadership. That was exactly what happened 
on the beach in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas' Palestine Liberation Front, which committed the beach action, is both 
the smallest and the most militant of the fringe groups within the PLO. Abbas 
is a rejectionist who wants neither negotiations nor peace with Israel. But he 
knew -- all the time laughing to himself -- that Israel, Washington and much of 
American Jewry, including most Jewish members of Congress, would deal with the 
beach incident by claiming that it was Arafat's doing, pure and simple. 
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III were caught in the 
resulting political frenzy and finally suspended the U.S.-PLO dialogue in 
Tunis. They were responding to the politics of the situation, not to its logic 
or its merits. 
</P>
<P>
That Arafat did not meet Washington's conditions for continuing the dialogue 
surprised few. After all, the instinct to avoid his adversary's trap -- that 
is, to play into Abbas' hands -- must itself have been overwhelming. The Bush 
Administraiton had just vetoed the U.N. Security Council resolution for a human 
rights survey team to go into the occupied territories, having earlier tacitly 
led observers to believe that it would not use the veto. At the very moment it 
was making demands on Arafat, Washington was thereby squandering some of its 
credibility, goodwill and moral authority to make any demands. Arafat's final 
straw had to be the humiliation that the Bush-Baker team immediately added by 
going public with stern demands that he condemn and discipline Abbas. Knowing 
the internal politics of the PLO, they also knew that such public demands would 
make it harder for him to accede. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, accede he should have. It is the classic response of the underdog 
-- which, unfortunately, Arafat is in this instance -- to place too much 
emphasis on principle when the others, especially Washington, were giving a 
higher priority to politics and face-saving. His unwillingness to meet those 
demands has now helped put the dialogue and quite possibly the peace process on 
the back burner. So, in the final analysis, and despite himself, Arafat played 
into Abbas' game anyway. All of us are the losers -- the glee of Yitzhak Shamir 
and some Israeli and American hard-liners notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
For what end, anyone concerned with Israel should be asking, was the clamor to 
stop the Tunis talks all about? There is now far less opportunity for moral and 
political pressure on Arafat to moderate further -- which was the point in the 
first place. The United States also gives up the tools with which to strengthen 
Arafat against his own dissidents. The other side of that coin is that 
Washington has now abetted Abbas and his ilk in their drive to dislodge Arafat 
from the PLO leadership. If they succeed, Shamir may be pleased, but Israel 
would then face either the Abbas types calling the shots in the territories or 
else a fundamentalist leadership financed by Iran, a dynamic that already is 
disturbingly on the increase. 
</P>
<P>
Since forming his new Likud-led government, Shamir once again is talking peace 
just as he did in May, 1988. No doubt, he will again work resolutely to 
undermine the plan, always rationalizing that Arafat and the PLO are not the 
true representatives of the Palestinian people. This time he even expresses a 
willingness to sit down with the likes of Hafez Assad of Syria but not with 
Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Palestinians from the territories are now seeking an internationally 
supervised poll or plebiscite of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza to 
determine their choice of representation. Arafat should add to this calling of 
Shamir's bluff by applying his own pressure and put to rest once and for all, 
and one way or the other, Shamir's argument that the PLO does not represent the 
Palestinians in the territories. Then perhaps the peace process can move 
forward without deliberately distracting decoys.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE HOMELESS;

OFF THE STREETS, INTO THE SAFETY NET

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a decade after the Reagan Administration abdicated its commitment to 
low-cost housing and the social safety net, Americans are experiencing 
"compassion fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
Frightened by aggressive panhandlers and unsettled by disheveled street people, 
citizens are demanding some sort of solution to the growing homeless 
population. 
</P>
<P>
In New York and Atlanta, public restiveness prompted orders to use police force 
to clear public parks and streets of the homeless. Closer to home, a 
pro-homeless rally in Santa Cruz sparked an angry counter-demonstration, where 
participants shouted "homeless, go to hell." 
</P>
<P>
Even in San Francisco, a city famous for its tolerance, one politician demanded 
that police roust homeless people by force from a public park in the Civic 
Center, across from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor, I share the impatience with finding a solution. But San Francisco has 
chosen a different path, rejecting the notion that homeless people should be 
rousted out of town on the end of a police baton. Instead we have constructed, 
and this month began installing, a system of choices designed to help homeless 
people pull their lives back together. 
</P>
<P>
At its core is a fundamental shift away from the traditional American 
disaster-relief model with which most cities, including San Francisco, 
responded to homelessness in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But we now recognize that treating homeless people like victims of floods, 
hurricanes or earthquakes ignores the underlying causes: the critical shortage 
of low-cost housing, along with mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse, 
unemployment and family breakups. So, for the past two years, San Francisco has 
been shifting city policy toward helping homeless people live independently. 
</P>
<P>
After months of planning and coordination with advocates for the homeless and 
even the homeless themselves, the city opened two multiservice centers designed 
to connect homeless people with health and social services and, ultimately, the 
housing they need to stabilize their lives. 
</P>
<P>
When a homeless person walks through the door of one of these centers, he or 
she is served by a team of health and social welfare workers armed with the 
resources to address the underlying causes of homelessness. Housing, job 
training, mental health programs and drug and alcohol programs are all part of 
this comprehensive approach. The centers are a first stop, not a dead end. The 
ultimate goal is to get the clients into transitional and permanent housing and 
onto a track of self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
During the two years that these centers and the programs supporting them were 
put into place, there was criticism that nothing was being done to solve the 
homeless problem. But I could not in good conscience simply tell homeless 
people in the Civic Center to "get out of town," as was done in other cities, 
when we did not have a humane and decent alternative. 
</P>
<P>
However, once that alternative was available, I could not in good conscience 
allow them to stay outdoors at night. I believe that when decent alternatives 
exist, people lose their right to sleep outside -- and the two centers have 
fully accommodated all of the homeless people who once stayed in the Civic 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Some people argued differently. When the options were in place and police began 
to enforce the "no sleeping" law, the same advocates for the homeless who had 
criticized government for moving too slowly now said we moved too fast. 
Ironically, the same people who for years called attention to the plight of 
people sleeping on the streets suddenly began to argue that no one should be 
deprived of their "right" to do so. I do not believe that someone has a "right" 
to sleep on the pavement when a humane and decent alternative exists. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, children, seniors and lunching city workers, once intimidated by the 
homeless, have returned to the Civic Center. It is, in a sense, a return to 
normalcy for this part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
If it works, this San Francisco model, like the city's AIDS-response model 
before it, may be copied by other cities. For now, it has at least silenced 
critics of the homeless: Merchants, newspaper editorial writers and 
publicity-seeking politicians are giving the program a chance. 
</P>
<P>
We do not claim that this modest, if hopeful, start means that San Francisco 
has solved its homeless problem. We have taken the best advice of experts in 
developing a comprehensive system that we think will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
In a civilized society, we have an obligation to do more than just step over 
the homeless: We have to step up to the challenge they represent and find real 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco is now geared up to help. And when decent alternatives exist, 
people lose their right to sleep outside.

HAWTHORNE IS SUED OVER DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mother of a psychiatric patient whom police killed near his home has filed 
a wrongful-death complaint against the city of Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint alleges that police used "unreasonable, unnecessary and deadly 
force" against Terence Williams, 20, who was shot five times and died in a July 
1 confrontation in which two officers suffered facial injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting is being investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, which handles homicide cases for the Hawthorne police. The names of 
the officers involved have not been released. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who suffered from schizophrenia, had escaped from Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center a few hours before his death, allegedly after he assaulted a guard 
there. Williams had entered the hospital earlier in the day for a 72-hour 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, which seeks no specific amount in damages, was filed on behalf 
of Williams' mother, Loretta Brown, 44. 
</P>
<P>
It alleges that the city of Hawthorne as the officers' employer, "knew or 
should have known" that the officers involved in the confrontation "had 
propensities for violence and for abusing their authority."

REPAIR OF PIPE WILL HALT WATER TO SOUTH S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much of south San Diego's water supply will be shut off from 11 p.m. tonight 
until 6 a.m. Saturday morning while city Water Utilities Department workers fix 
a leak on a valve in the south San Diego pipeline, the major feeder for the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in San Ysidro, Otay Mesa, and Nestor are being asked to store any 
water they will need for cooking or sanitary purposes during that period before 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
If residents in those areas need water during the seven-hour shutdown, the city 
will have water wagons set up at three locations: the intersection of 24th 
Street and Palm Avenue, about three-eights of a mile east of Interstate 5; at 
the south end of San Ysidro Boulevard, about a half mile north of the border; 
and at the intersection of Picador Boulevard and Del Sol Boulevard, about a 
fourth of a mile north of California 905 and about a mile west of Interstate 
805. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be allowed to take as much water as they can carry, though city 
officials prefer they stock up before the water is turned off. Containers will 
not be provided. 
</P>
<P>
Workers earlier this week discovered the leak in one of the 33-inch diameter 
pipeline's air valves during routine tests. 
</P>
<P>
The leak resulted from a deterioration of the valve's fitting, and has nothing 
to do with the pipe itself, which is structurally healthy, said Charles Yackly, 
assistant deputy director of the department. 
</P>
<P>
The valve, in an underground vault near Otay Valley Road, has been leaking 10 
gallons per minute at most. Yackly said it is in a remote area, and traffic 
will not be interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city wanted to stop the relatively minor leak as quickly as 
possible because it feared it could become more serious. 
</P>
<P>
"If that happened, we would have to shut down the pipeline right away without 
being able to schedule it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If customers have any questions, they can call 236-5600 today. RICHARD A. OPPEL 
JR.

PANEL URGES CLASSROOM AIR CONDITIONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles school board committee recommended Thursday installing window air 
conditioners at a handful of San Fernando Valley schools to see if the units 
will provide a low-cost alternative to central air-conditioning, which would 
cost an estimated $675 million to install at campuses citywide. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot program -- which must be approved by the full school board -- could 
reduce air-conditioning costs by more than two-thirds, said Julie Crum, 
assistant director of maintenance for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate that it will cost about $90 million to install central 
air-conditioning at 61 year-round schools in the Valley, the area identified as 
having the highest temperatures in the city. Installing window air conditioners 
would cost an estimated $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether the window units will be too noisy and whether they 
can cool off a room with 30 warm bodies," Crum said. 
</P>
<P>
The school board's building committee also agreed to apply for $30 million of 
the $45 million in state bond money approved by voters in June to pay for 
air-conditioning year-round schools. 
</P>
<P>
Parents representing schools in the Valley told building committee members that 
classrooms this past month have been too hot for their children to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"It is terrible for the kids," agreed school board member Julie Korenstein, who 
represents the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said it will take several years to install central 
air-conditioning at the more than 475 schools that will need such systems when 
the entire district converts to year-round scheduling next summer. 
</P>
<P>
The year-round schedules were approved by the board earlier this year to make 
more classroom space available in the fast-growing district. 
</P>
<P>
Some board members have suggested the district raise funds for air-conditioning 
and other improvements through a local bond measure in the next two years. A 
similar measure was narrowly defeated by Beverly Hills voters in June.

CREW OF NAVY JET RESCUED AFTER CRASH STARTS BRUSH FIRE NEAR SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Both crew members of a Navy attack jet were rescued Thursday shortly after 
their plane crashed in the Santa Ynez Mountains and ignited a rapidly spreading 
brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot and navigator of the A-7 Corsair jet, found near the crash site, were 
"in reasonably good condition" in local hospitals Thursday, said Navy spokesman 
Bob Hubbert. 
</P>
<P>
They had left the Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu, about five miles 
south of Oxnard, about noon Thursday on a routine training mission, Hubbert 
said. Their plane crashed about an hour later in a rugged area of the Los 
Padres National Forest, seven miles north of Montecito. 
</P>
<P>
The crash sparked a brush fire that had burned more than 300 acres by late 
afternoon. Hundreds of firefighters battled the blaze as air tankers and 
helicopters dumped fire retardant on the burning brush. The fire was burning 
northward, away from populated areas, said Becky Bittner, a spokeswoman for the 
U.S. Forest Service. No structures were threatened, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out near the Gibraltar Reservoir, about 12 miles northeast of 
Santa Barbara, where a disastrous wildfire last month destroyed more than 400 
homes and blackened about 4,500 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Although firefighters were hampered by hot, humid weather and rugged terrain, 
they did not have to contend with the 50 m.p.h. winds of the earlier fire.

AIR SHOW TO HONOR PILOTS, BUT STAY GROUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A B-1 bomber, F-16 fighters and other front-line military aircraft as well as 
World War II fighter planes will be on display this weekend at Van Nuys 
Airport's free Aviation Expo 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the two-day event drew 150,000 people, making it the largest public 
event in the San Fernando Valley, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But this year's show, unlike recent ones, will not include flying 
demonstrations, a result of homeowner complaints to the Board of Airport 
Commissioners last year. 
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's show, which is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., is "A 
Salute to the Pilots of World War II." On Saturday and Sunday, there will be 
ceremonies commemorating the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of black military 
aviators who fought during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The air show will be in the airport's northwest corner, at the former Air 
National Guard site on Balboa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
There will be three satellite parking lots with shuttle buses -- at 8400-8520 
Balboa Blvd., 16555 Saticoy St. and 17400 Victory Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Joint sponsors are the city Department of Airports, the Greater Van Nuys Area 
Chamber of Commerce and Anheuser-Busch Inc.

PADRE ACT GETS COMICAL IN ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The folks of St. Louis have been reading all of the rave reviews for the past 
four weeks. Friends have told them all about it, saying this is a show that can 
not be missed. 
</P>
<P>
But you know how reviews can be, lots of hype and a huge letdown. So who could 
blame the fans of St. Louis for being a bit skeptical when they arrived 
Thursday night to Busch Stadium, wondering if the show really could be as good 
as advertised. 
</P>
<P>
Well, by the time the show ended Thursday night, with the bumbling Padres 
losing once again, 8-3, you should have seen the 29,688 paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
They were standing on their feet, begging for more. 
</P>
<P>
Fans were flicking their cigarette lighters, pleading for just one more 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, the Padres said, that's all for this night. They'll be around for the 
next three days, so come on back, there'll be plenty of more laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Where else can you spend $5 bucks for the cheap seats and see the most comical 
team since the 1951 St. Louis Browns, whose owner had to resort to bringing in 
a midget for laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, all Padre chairman Tom Werner has to do is just throw nine players, any 
nine, on the field to generate the kind of laughter that has people tumbling 
down the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
If the act starts to get stale . . . well, maybe that's what Werner had in mind 
when he invited Roseanne Barr to sing the national anthem Wednesday. When she's 
done, she can stick on a uniform and play a few innings. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, those fun-loving Padres, losers of 17 of the past 20, when will they stop? 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Padres ever had a worse 20-game stretch than this was when 
Nixon was President. The Padres twice had stretches of 18 losses in 20 games 
during their inaugural year in 1969, but stay tuned, 74 games still remain in 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder when first baseman Jack Clark got ejected in the sixth inning by 
home-plate umpire Jerry Davis for arguing a called third-strike, Clark threw 
out this beauty: 
</P>
<P>
"I might try to get thrown out every . . . day. I'd have more fun, that's for 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, those Padres. Just when you think they can't get any worse, they put on an 
exhibition like Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Where else can you see a team make two errors on this night, and 10 since the 
All-Star break? They've allowed 20 runs the past three games; 13 have been 
unearned. 
</P>
<P>
Where else in the same game can you see Clark forget to cover a bunt at first 
base; shortstop Garry Templeton forget to cover second on a stolen-base 
attempt; third baseman Eddie Williams forget to swing on a hit-and-run; and 
second baseman Bip Roberts forget to get down on a ground ball that goes past 
him. 
</P>
<P>
And you wonder why this team has somehow managed to lead at the end of just 36 
of the past 185 innings? 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a bad team right now," Clark said. "We're playing bad, and we've 
been playing bad. The way we're going right now, we're giving teams a chance to 
break things wide open." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Greg Riddoch, who took over at the break for Jack McKeon, says to go 
ahead and blame him instead of his players. He'll says that he'll take 
responsibility for these defeats. 
</P>
<P>
That's awfully heroic of him, but hell, Connie Mack couldn't win with this 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's time Werner took over the public-address microphone the way former 
Padre owner Ray Kroc did on the opening day of 1974, and utter those infamous 
words: "This is the stupidest baseball I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
"We're all trying to figure out what's going on," said Padre right fielder Tony 
Gwynn, who was celebrating his eighth anniversary of breaking into the big 
leagues. "I keep thinking we'll turn it around, but I'm sure getting sick of 
saying it." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest problem, Clark said, is their lack of direction. No one 
knows if the Padres are going after victories, if they're in midst of a 
rebuilding process, or if they're just plain experimenting. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to get to the point where we need to say what we want to 
accomplish," Clark said, "whether we're in a building stage or whether we want 
to win. We've made a lot of changes, but we really haven't put our finger on 
what we want to accomplish. We need to clarify that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going through our rebuilding stage, but we haven't actually 
admitted that to you guys (reporters), or to ourselves. And because of that, I 
don't think it's fair to a lot of the young players or the position players to 
say we're an awful team. But the chemistry's so messed up, we're looking like 
one." 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious we're not going to win it this year, anyway, but it's tough to 
come in here and feel like a winner when you always lose. No one's having fun 
in here. No one's doing cartwheels. It's screwed up. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to win no championship this year, but you can be champions 
without having the title." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres indeed have been in a state of transition the past 2 1/2 weeks. Not 
only do they have a new manager and two new coaches, but they have five players 
on their roster who were playing in triple-A just 16 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch, however, didn't buy the argument as an explanation for their losing 
ways, and said that there's no reason they shouldn't be playing better than 
this. 
</P>
<P>
"The job comes down to throwing the ball, hitting the ball, and catching the 
ball," Riddoch said. "It's a 10-day road trip, you can't panic. Also, we have 
injuries, so we can't throw the same lineup out there each day and go with it." 
</P>
<P>
The latest injury occurred to Roberts, who jammed his hand in the first inning 
while sliding into first base and likely will miss today's game, Riddoch said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting to the point where nothing feels comfortable," Roberts said, who 
has started at four different positions this season. "I basically don't know 
where I'm playing each day. I mean, I know I'll play, but I just don't know 
where. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I keep screwing up, I'm not going to be playing anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, can be said about a whole lot of guys right now. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn, who has already had dozens of his bats stolen this season at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, almost had a bigger scare when he learned that 
burglars attempted to break into his house Sunday. But alarms went off, the 
police arrived and the burglars fled before anything was stolen. "Thank God 
nobody was home," Gwynn said. "It would have really scared my family. There was 
no damage, but still, it makes you upset and pretty mad that something like 
that would happen." . . . Andy Benes could miss his scheduled start Sunday 
against the Cardinals because of a sore left shoulder. If he's unable to pitch, 
left-hander Derek Lilliquist will take his place. Benes, a righthander, still 
has a sore left shoulder from the melee July 12 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
when third baseman Bobby Bonilla tugged at his arm. "There's no sense taking 
any chances, especially at this point of the season," said Pat Dobson, Padre 
pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres finally got Davis from Kansas City. No, not that Davis. The Padres 
purchased the contract of reliever John Davis of Las Vegas to replace pitcher 
Mike Dunne, who Tuesday fractured his right leg Tuesday. Davis was raised in 
the Kansas City organization, but was traded in 1987 as part of the deal that 
sent pitchers Melido Perez, Greg Hibbard and Chuck Mount from Kansas City to 
Chicago for pitcher Floyd Bannister. Perez and Hibbard are in the White Sox 
starting rotation; Bannister is in Japan. Davis made his debut with the Padres 
on Thursday, pitching a hitless inning by inducing two ground balls and a 
strikeout. . . . When Calvin Schiraldi entered the game in the fifth inning in 
relief of Bruce Hurst, he became the first Padre pitcher since the Kroc era to 
wear a beard in uniform. The Kroc family, which has owned the team from 1984 to 
June, 1990, had a team rule prohibiting players from wearing beards. Schiraldi 
just started growing his beard a week ago. . . . Padre players Jack Clark, Ed 
Whitson and Mark Parent spent Wednesday night fishing at one of the lakes on 
Cardinal pitcher Danny Cox's 80-acre estate. Clark led the group by catching 
two fish. Whitson and Parent were shut out. The highlight of the adventure? "It 
was pitch-black out there," Parent said, "and a dog started paddling out of 
nowhere. We didn't know what it was until it got close to us. It scared the 
hell out of us." 
</P>
<P>
Dal Maxvill, Cardinal general manager, met Wednesday night with Angel 
broadcaster Joe Torre to discuss the Cardinal managing job. He interviewed Gene 
Tenace on Thursday. . . . Whitey Herzog, former Cardinal Manager, on the 
continued poor play of the Cardinals: "I guess it wasn't me. I thought I was 
the cause of it." . . . Baby watch: Padre pitcher Mike Dunne's wife, Pam, is 
due July 31 with their first baby; Parent's wife, Wendy, is due Aug. 1 with 
their first-born. . . . Cardinal reliever Lee Smith, on the hazards of having 
two teammates with the same last name: "You're walking through an airport, and 
somebody says, 'Hey, Smitty,' and three guys turn around." . . . The Padres are 
batting just .172 on this trip with two out and runners in scoring position. . 
. . Garry Templeton obtained his first triple since Aug. 21, 1989, when 
Cardinal center fielder Willie McGee missed making a shoestring catch.

TASTE OF PRO BASEBALL WHETS MINOR LEAGUERS' APPETITES

RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Life in Class A is all about major league dreams and pizza parlor budgets. 
There are no agents here, and a contract is a thing to prize, not renegotiate. 
Most of these guys are in their early 20s and make between $1,000 and $1,200 a 
month for playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
When the team is on the road, players receive $11 a day for meal money. They 
eat at fast-food restaurants and talk about how much better things are going to 
get. Eleven bucks. Bon appetit. 
</P>
<P>
But, hey, this is a taste of professional baseball. An hors d'oeuvre, maybe, 
but a taste nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the clubhouse, a real professional clubhouse, Riverside Red Wave players 
were dressing for the game. One conversation focused on the players' Charlie 
Maxwell League -- a type of Rotisserie Baseball league in which the 
participants get points for how players do on Sundays. Riverside is a Padre 
Class A affiliate, so it's easy to guess the most popular picks in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Roberto Alomar is tearing it up for you," someone said. 
</P>
<P>
There was a sign in the clubhouse: "I need six players to sign autographs at a 
Pizza Hut Grand Opening on July 24. 10:30-1. You will get free pizza and Pepsi. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
A minute earlier, a representative from Topps had walked by the sign on his way 
to hand out a pack of baseball cards to each player. 
</P>
<P>
This was last Wednesday. The temperature was well over 100 degrees, and there 
was a first-stage smog alert. Out on the field, just before batting practice, 
Jack McKeon's stepping down as Padre manager earlier in the day dominated 
conversation. The voices came from all over. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened up there today?" a player asked. 
</P>
<P>
"A.O. (former batting coach Amos Otis) got released? He was my man." 
</P>
<P>
"Pepper is more important than ever, now." 
</P>
<P>
You see, Jack Maloof, formerly the roving minor league hitting instructor, had 
been promoted to Padre batting coach earlier in the day. It was Maloof who last 
year ordered teams throughout the Padre farm system to play more pepper because 
a couple of the teams weren't hitting. 
</P>
<P>
News from above was interesting, but . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You seen our new baseball cards?" outfielder Reggie Farmer asked. "First time 
I've ever seen minor league cards with action shots." 
</P>
<P>
These players' stories are as similar as their backgrounds are different. So 
young. So eager. So excited. All have hopes of fame and glory and big 
paychecks. Most of them have cars. Most have a wife or a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Their days are long, consisting of a lot of time sitting and waiting for 
another game. They get up toward noon. They have lunch. They play video games 
or go shopping or watch television. They get to the ballpark by 3 or 4 and go 
to work. Games are usually finished around 10, so they go home, get something 
to eat and watch more television. 
</P>
<P>
One thing about the minors: There is a lot of free time. This is why pitcher 
Chris Haslock found a firecracker attached to his shoe by glue and gum one day. 
And it is why infielder Steve Bethea bit into a brownie one day and ended up 
with a mouthful of coffee grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The names on the roster, aside from pitcher Candy Sierra, are unfamiliar. You 
wonder if one might be the next Roberto Alomar or Tony Gwynn. Then you remember 
that the baseball people say there are two, maybe three, legitimate prospects 
per team in A ball. 
</P>
<P>
What it comes down to is that most of the Red Wave are in their big leagues 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
But don't tell them that. They have a vision, and it is focused especially on 
Wichita, home of the Padre double-A team and their next rung on the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
And while they're at it, they keep track of the Padres. What occurs in the 
major leagues sometimes has a domino effect throughout the organization. This 
happened to Tony McGee. 
</P>
<P>
He was backing up Kevin Higgins at catcher in Riverside. He was frustrated. He 
had never been a backup player. Not many here have. All of these guys were 
stars in high school or college. 
</P>
<P>
First, he was bitter. Finally, he resigned himself to being a back-up. 
</P>
<P>
Then Benito Santiago sustained a broken arm, and the aftershocks rumbled all 
the way down to Riverside. A couple of catchers were moved up a level, 
including Higgins, who went to Wichita. McGee inherited his job in Riverside 
and got an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
That's all these guys are looking for. A chance. Todd Dewey, another catcher, 
signed with Riverside in early July. Once, he was one of the best prospects in 
Atlanta's system. He moved all the way up to triple-A at Richmond before 
breaking a couple of ribs in a collision at home plate. When he came back, he 
didn't hit well. Suddenly, he was on his way down. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 23, he jokes about being the oldest player in the California League, 
the league in which Riverside plays. But he clings to his chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Why sign again in A ball?" Dewey said, repeating the question. "The way I look 
at it, it's another chance to go up again. I've seen guys go up and down awful 
fast. If the timing is right, things could work out for me." 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't have a timetable. Hey, any game could be the springboard to a major 
league career. There are 141 games a year. Give yourself a time limit, you only 
set a clock on your dream. Tick, tick, tick, poof. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dream, a goal," said Farmer, who went to Madison High. "I'm not going 
to quit on it. I'll let it quit on me before I quit on it. Trades, strikes, so 
many things can happen for you to put a time limit to get to The Show." 
</P>
<P>
So they go game by game and month by month, and they hope for an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as the case may be, a cam-corder. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Farmer was telling Tye Waller, the Padre roving minor league 
outfield and baserunning instructor, as they sat in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"Filming your at-bats, especially in a long season like this, comes in handy," 
Farmer said. "You can see it on film. How to avoid slumps. It's great." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to get a cam-corder this winter. 
</P>
<P>
Batting practice was nearly finished. Mark Gieseke was talking to Coach Nate 
Colbert about slumps. 
</P>
<P>
"Nate, I'm not seeing the ball," Gieseke said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're head is going like this," Colbert answered, tilting his head forward 
and down. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm losing confidence. Last night when I was hitting right-handed, Nate, two 
balls came right down the middle and I missed them. I've hit rock bottom." 
</P>
<P>
"No, now you're talking and losing your confidence. You're going to have about 
three hot periods and a couple of down periods each year." 
</P>
<P>
Slumps and the major leagues aren't the only kinds of things they worry about. 
When they got back from the last road trip, three players' cars had been 
burglarized. McGee's equalizer and stereo were stolen two weeks after he 
arrived in Riverside. And the car was at his apartment, under the carport. 
</P>
<P>
"Every little noise, I'm looking around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McGee is in his first full season of professional baseball. He played under 
Manager Bruce Bochy in Spokane last year and is in Riverside this year. A 
native of Florida who attended Jacksonville University, he lives here with 
Terri, his wife of seven months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather have her here than away," he said. "She's my No. 1 fan. I like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Most wives and girlfriends have to work to help pay the bills. Terri McGee, for 
example, works for a temporary service. 
</P>
<P>
The players, none of whom are from Riverside, live in various apartment 
complexes within a couple of blocks of the ballpark. In other towns, many of 
them say, players lived in the same complex. But with UC Riverside up the road, 
there is always a demand for apartments, and each complex manager can't 
guarantee he will have the necessary 10 or 12 units open during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them live four to a unit. A few, those with good winter jobs, live two 
to an apartment. Some of the players go to school in the off-season, but most 
of them just work. Second baseman Scott Bigham was an internal auditor for a 
trucking company last winter. He was offered a full-time job and $35,000 but 
turned it down to play baseball. Dewey worked in a machine shop and, before 
that, delivered flowers for four years. Sherman sold mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty expensive here," said Steve Hendricks, an infielder from Coronado. 
"I paid $285 for a two-bedroom apartment in Waterloo (Class A), and it was 
good-sized. Here, it's $695 for a two-bedroom apartment that is about the same 
size. These are a little nicer here." 
</P>
<P>
Road trips are a series of games surrounded by a steady diet of fast food. 
That's why the Padres spend $40 per day per minor league team to stock the 
clubhouse with fruit, both at home and on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"You scrape in this game," Gieseke said. "Most fans see all of the big money, 
but don't realize players had to go through all of this. It's all worth it, 
though. I wouldn't trade a day." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside's top two prospects probably are pitcher Brian Harrison and first 
baseman Dave Staton. The Padres think Harrison has a major league arm. Staton 
won the Northwest League triple crown last season in Spokane with a .362 
average, 17 home runs and 72 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see in the last four or five years, I'm getting better," Staton said 
last week. "I can look at myself now and see I'm the same person as when I came 
out of high school, but I'm not the same player. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I was a little boy, all I wanted to do was play this game. I'm 
going to give 100% until somebody says I can't play anymore. Then, I might even 
call them a liar and keep on playing." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, his future became even brighter. Staton was promoted to 
double-A Wichita.

HENNING SEES CONTINUITY AS CAMP BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the sun shining overhead and the Pacific Ocean shimmering in the 
background, it was another perfect mid-summer afternoon Thursday in La Jolla as 
Dan Henning peered through his sunglasses into the start of his second training 
camp as Charger coach. 
</P>
<P>
His lenses might have been tinted green, but Henning's vision was more 
rose-colored. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there are some concerns -- special teams, the offensive line, the 
secondary and a young starting quarterback, to name the four Henning found 
potentially troublesome -- but there is more to feel better about than there 
was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Improvements at running back, at punter, in the overall quarterback situation 
and in general depth had Henning taking an optimistic tone. 
</P>
<P>
"The two things that make the difference in this league are talent and 
continuity," Henning said. "We're a step ahead by far in continuity, and we 
think we might be a step ahead or two in talent." 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of time of year it is. The opening of training camp tends to 
bring out the best in every team -- especially on paper. 
</P>
<P>
But starting in the next few days, Henning will begin to discover if his vision 
of improvement is real or imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Rookies, free agents and selected veterans, including Plan B acquisitions, are 
to report to training camp at the UC San Diego by 6:45 tonight. This group of 
approximately 60 players will hold its first practice at 4 p.m. Sunday. The 
remaining players are set to report next Friday and begin practice the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to the season," Henning said. "I'm looking forward to the 
competition. I'm looking forward to success." 
</P>
<P>
Though such talk may be easy, there are concrete reasons for Henning's 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of the aggressive work of General Manager Bobby Beathard, the 
Chargers already have a new look. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 47 players on the roster at the end of last season, 14 are gone. Add in 
the players from the various reserve and developmental rosters, and Beathard 
has disposed of 20 of the 59 players he inherited when he took over Jan. 3 from 
Steve Ortmayer, who had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Most noticeable among the departures are running back Gary Anderson (traded to 
Tampa Bay), offensive tackle James FitzPatrick (lost to the Raiders in Plan B), 
center Don Macek (retired) and quarterback Jim McMahon (cut, then signed by 
Philadelphia). 
</P>
<P>
Most notable among the arrivals, not including the 17 draft choices, are the 
nine Plan B free agents. These include punter John Kidd and running backs 
Ronnie Harmon and Thomas Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd is expected to take over a punting game that tied for 18th out of 28 NFL 
teams, while Harmon and Sanders will be looked upon to add depth and experience 
to a running attack that ranked 21st. They are two of nine running backs on the 
current roster. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition is on," Henning said. "We're much better this year than (what) 
we had in camp last year at that position." 
</P>
<P>
But this also is a time of year when not all the news is made on the field. 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday night, as many as 15 Chargers, including six of 17 draft 
choices, were without a contract agreement. Most prominent among the unsigned 
rookies is No. 1 selection Junior Seau, the inside linebacker from USC. 
</P>
<P>
Such contract haggling is another part of the training camp regimen, one over 
which Henning has little control and one for which he simply compensates in his 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
"The negotiation of contracts is between Bobby and his staff, and the players 
and their staffs or agents or whatever," Henning said. "The coaching staff and 
players' focus has to be on getting done what we have to get done on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"It's uncomfortable, but it seems to be the cost of doing business these days." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Second-year wide receiver Wayne Walker and rookie center Frank Cornish joined 
the list Thursday of signed Chargers. Cornish, a sixth-round pick from UCLA, 
signed a two-year agreement that will pay him an average of $140,000 per year, 
said his agent, Leigh Steinberg. No details of Walker's agreement were released 
by the team. . . . The Chargers are close to reaching the league limit of 80 
signed players. Once they do, they will have to cut a player for every one they 
sign. The Chargers have 93 players on their roster, 78 of whom are known of 
have signed or agreed to terms. . . . Coach Dan Henning said he expected all 
players would be cleared to participate but said offensive tackle Joel Patten, 
who had arthroscopic knee surgery about six weeks ago, may be worked into 
practice slowly.

<P>
RUNNER-UP FINISH SHOWS SHE'S ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In her first three-kilometer time trial, after only 2 1/2 months of training on 
a track, Boulevard's Marti Ray of the San Diego Cyclo-Vets placed second 
Thursday in the women's 40-over division in the Masters National Cycling 
Championships at the Velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
Ray finished in 4:23.88, behind Camille Buchannan of Williamsburg, Va., who won 
in 4:22.23. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy. I did my personal best," Ray said. "I pretty much went out 
and did what Dave Grylls (her coach and a former Pan Am champion) projected I 
would do from practice runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally in love with track racing. The depth and intensity of training 
required on the track will be terribly beneficial to my endurance." 
</P>
<P>
Ray, 40, who has been competing in biathlons for two years, considers herself 
an "endurance athlete" and usually does marathon cycling; she began cycling 13 
years ago as a form of fitness. There was a five-year span during which she 
quit the sport, but she resumed five years ago when she began to feel out of 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
Ray had planned to do the 40-kilometer time trial in Tijuana Monday, but a 
collision Sunday in the national biathlon in Ontario, Calif., made it 
impossible for her to ride in it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unfortunate mishap," Ray said. "A women ran into me and poked a hole 
in my disc (wheel)." 
</P>
<P>
Ray finished that race and took third, but shortly after the brand new, $1,200 
wheel was taken off the bike, it exploded. She didn't have another wheel to use 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Ralph, has designed and built approximately 12 bikes for her so 
far. The couple has traveled to the wind tunnel at Texas A&amp;M to test the 
aerodynamics on all their equipment. Marti has been in the wind tunnel four 
times and has the lowest drag coefficient of anyone who has tested there. This 
means her style is the most streamlined. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph invented a training device called Spin Coach and had it patented in 1981. 
It's unlike a stationary bike in that it allows the cyclist to do isolated leg 
training in addition to a regular workout. 
</P>
<P>
"You can train one leg at a time for specific training of muscles," Marti said. 
"You develop a nerve pattern in the muscles, and it makes the leg more fluid in 
the entire stroke." 
</P>
<P>
Ray does most of her training on the stationary bike but takes to the road "to 
develop road-handling skills or for social fun rides." 
</P>
<P>
After a fourth-place finish in the men's 30-34 one kilometer time trial 
Wednesday, Danny Van Haute of San Marcos won the three-kilometer time trial in 
3:45. Another local rider, Peter McCurdy, finished third in 3:48. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy, but I wanted to do 3:42," Van Haute said. "My dad (Frank, also his 
coach) was clocking me and said I was right on mark with two laps to go. Then I 
lost three seconds on those two laps."

AMERICAN LEGION DISTRICT 20 PLAYOFFS;

<P>
SUN VALLEY CAUGHT STEALING; 
</P>
<P>
ELIMINATION: TOP-SEEDED TEAM FALLS TO PANORAMA CITY AFTER NINTH-INNING STRATEGY 
FAILS AGAINST WOODLAND HILLS EAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sun Valley Coach Les Riley went for broke in the ninth inning of Thursday's 
American Legion playoff game with Woodland Hills East at Birmingham High. But 
after the last out was recorded, it was his team that was left to pick up the 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
With Sun Valley trailing, 4-3, with two out and runners on second and third, 
Riley sent Robert Aros home from third. On a 1-1 count, Eric Rothman threw a 
low fastball that catcher Carey Wilbur caught cleanly, tagging Aros a couple of 
yards from the plate to end the American Legion District 20 playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured (Aros) could beat the pitcher; he just didn't leave soon enough," 
Riley said. "It was a straight steal, a flip of the coin. I was hoping 
something would break and it didn't."

<P>
Woodland Hills East (21-4) and Woodland Hills West (21-4), the only teams still 
undefeated in the double-elimination tournament, will meet today at 4 p.m. at 
Birmingham. Sun Valley (20-6), which entered the tournament as the top-seeded 
team among eight teams, was eliminated later Thursday, dropping a 7-1 decision 
to Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City's Russell Ortiz (5-1) left little doubt about the result of the 
second game, handcuffing Sun Valley on four hits over eight innings. The 
conclusion of the first game was a little more controversial, though, and 
although East Coach Matt Borzello benefited from Riley's failed ninth-inning 
strategy, he questioned it just the same. 
</P>
<P>
"(It) was a gutsy call, I guess, but it shows me that they don't believe in the 
kid at the plate," Borzello said. "You have to believe in the batter at the 
plate." 
</P>
<P>
That batter was designated-hitter Sef Carlin, who was hitless in three at-bats 
Thursday after batting .370 during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
The bizarre ending offered a fitting conclusion to a game that was sloppily 
played throughout. The game-winning run, for instance, was one of only two 
earned runs in the game and it came home in the bottom of the seventh inning on 
a ground out by a batter Borzello felt should have been on first base. 
</P>
<P>
A one-out infield single by Wilbur, a ground-rule double by Benji Belfield and 
an intentional walk to Jamie Zeichick loaded the bases for John Erganian, who 
quickly worked the count to 3-2. Or at least Borzello thought it was 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
The next pitch from Sun Valley's Jake Loveridge (6-2) wasn't even close, 
hitting the dirt to the left of the plate. But Erganian didn't move and 
Loveridge was almost set to wind up again before Borzello ran in from the 
third-base coaching box to question the count. 
</P>
<P>
Both the plate umpire and Erganian thought the pitch was ball three, and when 
Borzello and the official scorer argued otherwise, the field umpire admitted 
that he, too, had the count at 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
So rather than walking to force in a run, Erganian had to face another pitch, 
which he grounded to second, scoring Wilbur. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a costly mistake, because there were now two outs with a run in, 
instead of one out," Borzello said. "We could no longer use the squeeze play or 
try to manufacture a run." 
</P>
<P>
Belfield led a 10-hit East attack, going four for four with a pair of doubles. 
Rothman (6-0) went the distance for East, finishing with a seven-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
In the nightcap, Roland De La Maza had two hits -- including a double -- in 
four at-bats to spark a balanced attack for Panorama City (20-6). 
</P>
<P>
Dave Unter relieved Ortiz in the ninth and retired Sun Valley in order to 
preserve the win.

WEST COAST'S BEST HIGH SCHOOL PLAYERS ELBOW FOR POSITION IN THE SPOTLIGHT AT 
SUPERSTAR BASKETBALL CAMP IN SANTA BARBARA

<P>
A group of about 500 high school basketball players and coaches are doing their 
best to scream and yell loud enough to get the thunder meter inside the Events 
Center at UC Santa Barbara to reach 100. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the thunderous roar is being recorded at 11 p.m. on a 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
At the recently completed Superstar Camp, basketball was on everyone's mind 
around the clock. Camp founder Max Shapiro said he averaged less than five 
hours of sleep a night during the five-day camp. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, the annual slam dunk contest produced several standing 
ovations. The traditional ritual allowed participants to dazzle the crowd with 
an array of dunks. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Famuyiwa of St. Bernard High received the evening's top score of 99 on the 
thunder meter when he successfully leaped over two players squatted on the 
court on his way to a flying one-handed dunk. 
</P>
<P>
The acrobatic move caught the attention of college coaches, who had gathered in 
the upper bleachers throughout the week to watch the action. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the camp has been the same since its inception in 1974: To allow 
the best high school players in the West to see how they stack up against each 
other. Superstar was the first camp of its kind in California and remains one 
of the area's best known. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to a lot of camps over the years and this one really gets the best 
of the crop," said Jim Brovelli, coach at the University of San Francisco. "The 
players are treated well here and there are no gimmicks. Everyone just gets a 
chance to play and show what they can do." 
</P>
<P>
While many summer camps are open to anyone, Superstar is by invitation only. 
Shapiro, whose San Francisco-based company Sports-world sponsors the camp, 
works with coaches and scouts to decide whom to invite. The majority of this 
year's 288 participants are from California, but top players from as far as 
Hawaii and Colorado attended. Martin King of Georgetown Prep in Rockville, Md., 
also made the trip. 
</P>
<P>
The price tag of $435, which doesn't include transportation costs, didn't seem 
to affect anyone. Shapiro said he had to turn away 60 players. "We've gotten 
bigger every year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A list of the camp's alumni, including NBA standouts Bill Cartwright, Bill 
Laimbeer, Kiki Vandeweghe and Fat Lever, and the fact that about 150 college 
coaches show up is usually enough to persuade most prep players to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only camp I'm attending this summer," said Famuyiwa, who will be a 
senior guard for the Vikings this season. "I was here last year and I know it's 
a good one. I'm here to improve my stock with the recruiters." 
</P>
<P>
Superstar provides very little time for practice or instruction. Most of the 
time spent on the court is reserved for playing games. The camp is broken down 
into 32 teams with nine players each, and there is a minimum of two games a 
day. When there is a break, most players can be found shooting baskets on an 
available court. 
</P>
<P>
"This camp is really a measuring stick," said Superstar director Rick Everleth, 
who coaches at La Jolla High. "A lot of players are stars at small schools, so 
this gives them a chance to see how they stack up against players from big 
schools. This camp draws many top players, so it helps a lot of guys put 
everything in proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Many find out here if they're college material or not." 
</P>
<P>
Superstar began receiving more attention from college coaches in 1983 when the 
NCAA adopted the early signing period, which allowed high school players to 
sign letters of intent in November. 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA guidelines, college coaches are allowed to evaluate players from 
July 5 to 31 this year. While coaches cannot have direct contact with potential 
recruits, players are aware of their presence. Mike Montgomery of Stanford and 
Carroll Williams of Santa Clara were among the coaches who made the trip to 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Many coaches had flown in from Princeton, N.J., where the prestigious Nike Camp 
was being held. The Nike Camp draws the top 120 seniors from across the country 
and almost all earn a Division I scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
But what makes Superstar special is that most of its participants are fighting 
for basketball survival. There is plenty of opportunities for a player to prove 
what he can do and an outstanding performance can vault an unknown into the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the college coaches had lists full of names. 
</P>
<P>
"I normally have an idea before I get here of who I want to look at," Brovelli 
said. "But there are always some surprises. There's always a sleeper in the 
bunch. You have to keep all of your options open because you never know which 
players are going to be interested in your program. They can really surprise 
you sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much time to watch these guys, so you really have to stay on top 
of it and follow through all of your leads." 
</P>
<P>
Brovelli signed seven players to scholarships last year and two of them, 
including his son Mike, attended Superstar. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches are not allowed to discuss names of potential recruits, but Paul 
Perkins of South Pasadena and David Harbour of Camarillo were two of the big 
surprises at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, a 6-6 forward/center, and Harbour, a 6-3 guard, generally were 
regarded as talented players who needed work on the fundamentals. They showed 
they could score and play defense at Superstar and were selected among the top 
15 players at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Highly regarded recruits Tyus Edney of Long Beach Poly and Juaquin Hawkins of 
Lynwood also made the top 15. 
</P>
<P>
Many underclassmen also attended the camp to polish their game and give the 
coaches an early glimpse of their talents. Juniors Deshaun Battle of Cajon and 
Brandon Titus of Gahr were among the top 15. 
</P>
<P>
Since as many as 10 indoor courts were being utilized simultaneously, it was 
difficult to keep up with all of the action. When players were not shooting 
baskets, they were either eating, sleeping or being shuffled to classrooms for 
academic counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Lorigo, head of counseling services for the Oakland Unified School 
District, has been lecturing to Superstar players for the past 12 years. One of 
his main objectives is to educate campers on the hazards of recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"I let them know when coaches can talk with them and what's legal and what's 
not," Lorigo said. "I give them sets of questions to ask and tell them what to 
look for when they make their visitations. I don't want them to have any major 
surprises when they get to college." 
</P>
<P>
Lorigo also discusses academic standards players are required to meet to avoid 
Proposition 48. Players took a sample Scholastic Aptitude Test and the results 
will be mailed to their homes so they can see where they need to improve. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Woolridge of the Lakers also made an appearance, talking with players 
about the hazards of drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
But basketball has priority at Superstar, and the players spend most of their 
time on the court. Helping keep order is a large staff of high school coaches 
and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches, many of whom have been attending the camp for years, like Mike 
LeDuc of Glendora and Bill Odell of Millikan, are assigned two teams. Shapiro 
said there is a waiting list of 20 coaches who want to work at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Counselors are college players who help the high school coaches on the court 
and maintain order in the dormitories. The most popular counselor among the 
players was Alex Austin, who attended Arizona State and recently signed with 
Houston Rockets. He often was found playing a game of one-on-one with a daring 
challenger. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches and counselors get together at the end of camp and evaluate all of 
the players. Each player receives an evaluation card that rates his skills on 
offense, defense and ball handling. 
</P>
<P>
A round-robin tournament is held on the final day to determine a team champion. 
But which team comes out victorious is less important than which individuals 
come out winners. 
</P>
<P>
For those who didn't shine, their hope is for a second chance to prove their 
value by attending another camp or by playing in a high-profile summer league. 
</P>
<P>
Those who did make an impression cross their fingers and hope the college 
coaches start calling. And then it's back to the basketball court.

TURNER FINDING NO HANDICAP IN LIMITED PRACTICE; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: VAN NUYS RESIDENT FORGOES EXTENSIVE PREPARATION, BUT THAT DIDN'T KEEP HIM 
FROM SECOND L.A. CITY AMATEUR TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
According to one school of thought, it doesn't take much effort to play 
even-par golf. All one has to do is play golf or hit practice balls seven or 
eight hours a day, seven days a week, sometimes at night, until the bones in 
one's hands begin to show through the skin, and then spend the rest of the time 
putting and analyzing videotape of one's swing. 
</P>
<P>
All of which leaves precious little time for other things, such as living. Most 
PGA stars make that little sacrifice, however, and have turned themselves into 
well-oiled, shot-producing machines capable of amazing golf shots and not too 
much of anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Amateur golfers, however, don't have the luxury of being able to pound golf 
balls until the shafts of their drivers begin to overheat. They have to work 
their golf in around a few other things, such as making a living and spending 
time with their families. 
</P>
<P>
But often, despite those great obstacles, amateur golfers succeed in honing 
their game to a great sharpness. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Turner is one who has done it. The furniture pillow manufacturer from Van 
Nuys has brought his game to a high level despite playing and practicing only 
around the schedule mandated by his job and the needs of his wife and young 
son. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, 33, won the Los Angeles City Amateur championship in 1987, and won it 
again last weekend. All of which makes one wonder what he'd be capable of if he 
ever got serious about the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I leave for work at 7 or 8 a.m. and get out at 5 p.m. or so," he said. "When 
I'm preparing for a tournament, I stop on the way home from work and hit balls 
at a range and one day during the week, I play a round of golf, starting at 5 
a.m." 
</P>
<P>
Owning his business -- with his father -- provides Turner the sole benefit to 
his game. 
</P>
<P>
One day a week he can arrive at the Paltex Inc. offices in Los Angeles at 11 
a.m. without losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not in a two- or three-week preparation program for a tournament, his 
golf falls to just a round a week at the Woodland Hills Country Club, with no 
time for hitting practice balls. And by the time September rolls around, golf 
falls yet another notch. 
</P>
<P>
"In September, I've really gotten burned out on golf and I put the clubs away," 
Turner said. "I play once in a while, maybe once a month or so, but until 
January, I never practice, never hit balls. Those are the months that I spend 
all of my time with my wife and son. I give them all of my time for the fall 
and winter." 
</P>
<P>
But yet, even with his clubs collecting dust, Turner will see his handicap fall 
only from scratch to a three by the time spring comes. 
</P>
<P>
And that goes a long way toward disproving the theory that golf is all 
practice. According to common belief, the more one practices, the better one 
gets. But that does not explain why so many 60-year-olds who have played golf 
two or three times a week for 40 years must yell "Fore!" while they're still in 
their backswings. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf requires talent," Turner said. "No question about it. Some people do some 
things better than other people. The best golfers in the world didn't get that 
way just because they hit range balls all day." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, the only left-hander ever to win the Los Angeles City Amateur in its 
70-year history, was always a better-than-average golfer. At Cal State 
Northridge, he was one of the school's top two golfers for three years. But it 
wasn't until a few years after he left school that his game began showing great 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Turner credits the improvement not to hours and hours of hand-blistering 
practice, but rather to a cerebral approach to practice and competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I watch guys all the time at the range hitting ball after ball, all day long," 
Turner said. "But they're not getting any better because they don't know what 
they are practicing. They spend three hours hitting balls and all it did was 
reinforce a bad swing habit. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned that with limited time, practicing the right way is the key. 
Everyone hits a certain percentage of their shots well, at any level. The more 
you practice the things that created those good swings, the higher the 
percentage of good swings you will make." 
</P>
<P>
Even though a high percentage of Turner's swings are good ones, he has never 
given much thought to the idea of turning professional. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time I had that decision to make, when I got out of college, I just 
wasn't good enough to really consider it," he said. "I just did not dominate my 
peers in golf. To realistically consider a life on the PGA Tour, you have to 
dominate the people you play against. I didn't do that. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very content to be the best amateur golfer I can be." 
</P>
<P>
For Turner -- and he makes this point emphatically -- that requires a wife who 
does not regularly throw steak knives past his head whenever he mentions that 
he might be playing golf in the morning or might be a bit late for dinner 
because he'll be at the practice range after work. 
</P>
<P>
"Lorrie is great about it," Turner said. "She knows how much it means to me. 
I'm lucky. She and our son, Sean, put up with me and my golf. My wife doesn't 
really play the game, but she gives me great support anyway." 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, the support of a family can make a difference, even in golf. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last round of the L. A. Amateur, I had about a 20-foot putt near the 
end," Turner said. "Lorrie and Sean were following me in a golf cart, and just 
as I got near the green, Sean fell out of the cart. My wife and I were pretty 
nervous and shaken up, but I had to keep playing. And I stood over that 20-foot 
putt and smashed it 10 feet past the cup. I was just worrying about my son, and 
I forgot about golf. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I walked over to them and saw that he was OK. And I came back to the 
green and made the 10-footer and hung on to win the tournament. Winning it was 
nice, but having my family there to watch it made it really special."

CRESPI'S MUCKEY TO SAMPLE LIFE OF MINOR LEAGUE COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crespi High baseball Coach Scott Muckey rolled his eyes when he was needled by 
a couple of his friends earlier this week. The boys jokingly had referred to 
Muckey's next baseball employer as the "Toledo Muck Hens." 
</P>
<P>
Close. Muckey will be working for the remainder of the summer as a coach for 
the Toledo Mud Hens, a member of the triple-A International League and an 
affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey couldn't help but smile at the razzing. Coaches don't often jump from 
the high school ranks directly into triple A, even on a temporary basis. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey, 37, who has coached Crespi for the past four seasons, left for Toledo 
on Thursday and will coach first base, pitch batting practice "and do anything 
else they need me to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Gamboa, a friend of Muckey's who recently became manager at Toledo, 
contacted Muckey this week about finishing the summer with the team. Muckey 
said he plans to coach at Crespi again next season. 
</P>
<P>
"We know each other pretty well," Muckey said of Gamboa, who lives in Canyon 
Country. "We've worked camps together off and on for the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Muckey replaces former major leaguer Aurelio Rodriguez, who left the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey coached Valley College from 1983-86 and was an assistant at Pepperdine 
from 1977-81.

DIGEST: NEDJAR TAKES OCCIDENTAL SOCCER JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sami Nedjar will take over as head coach of the Occidental College women's 
soccer team next season, the school announced. 
</P>
<P>
Nedjar acted as co-coach last season with Sue Semrau and was an assistant in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Nedjar has coached the boys' program at Oceanside High and served for two years 
as coach of the USC women's club soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
David McDivitt of Canyon High remained in intensive care Thursday at Henry Mayo 
Newhall Memorial Hospital after suffering a head injury that left him 
unconscious for about 30 seconds during a passing league football game 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The senior running back was mentally sharp Thursday and could move his 
shoulders and neck well, Canyon Coach Harry Welch said. McDivitt has undergone 
a series of tests, including a CAT scan and an electroencephalogram. 
</P>
<P>
While running a pass pattern, McDivitt (5-foot-9, 185 pounds) was upended and 
landed on his head during a game against Newbury Park at Hart High. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thought he had the wind knocked out of him," Welch said. "He was 
breathing, but it was more like he was in a deep sleep. When we couldn't get 
him to come around right away, we sent for an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
"He is our most gifted player on offense and is a real impact player. If he's 
healthy, he'll be one of the best running backs in the area." 
</P>
<P>
McDivitt rushed for 459 yards in 84 carries and scored four touchdowns last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Former Cal State Northridge star Keith Wright caught 10- and 39-yard touchdown 
passes from Tracy Ham in the first quarter, helping the Edmonton Eskimos to a 
41-23 victory over Doug Flutie and the British Columbia Lions in a Canadian 
Football League game Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Former Crespi High and Loyola Marymount standout Mike Yoest will begin his 
second effort in the past three years to earn a spot with the Sacramento Kings 
when he reports to the NBA team's summer rookie/free agent camp today. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-7 forward who played in Europe last season, Yoest also participated in 
Sacramento's 1988 summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
Yoest was a Southern Section 4-A Division second-team selection as a Crespi 
senior after a 1983-84 season in which he averaged 15.8 points and 11.2 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Former Antelope Valley College runner Greg Crosley will attempt to walk on the 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo track and cross-country teams in the upcoming school 
year, according to Mark Covert, his coach at Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Crosley advanced to the Southern California junior college regional finals in 
the 1,500 meters in May. 
</P>
<P>
A redshirt freshman from Monte Vista High in Danville, Crosley was also 
selected the Foothill Conference Male Track Athlete of the Year after winning 
the 1,500, the steeplechase and the 5,000 in the conference championship meet. 
</P>
<P>
Crosley, who has another year of junior college eligibility, attended San Luis 
Obispo in 1988-89 but did not compete. 
</P>
<P>
Sal Garfias of Glendale College, who helped lead the Vaqueros to a second-place 
showing at the Western State Conference cross-country championships, said he 
will also attend San Luis Obispo in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo won the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. cross-country 
title last November and dethroned four-time defending CCAA track champion Cal 
State Los Angeles in May. 
</P>
<P>
The top candidate for the Oak Park High basketball job has rejected the 
school's offer and the position remains open, school official Fred Yamano said. 
Yamano declined to name the candidate. The school is accepting applications. 
</P>

On Thursday, Manhattan State Beach reported waves of 2 to 3 feet at 10-second 
intervals. The water temperature was 71 degrees. There was a southwest swell. 
</P>
<P>
A good day to go surfing? 
</P>
<P>
Zackary Shinall used to think so, back in the days when he attended El Segundo 
High and El Camino College. Then Shinall had time to enjoy his two summer loves 
-- baseball and surfing. He followed the daily surf reports as closely as the 
box scores. 
</P>
<P>
But now that he's a professional in the Los Angeles Dodgers' minor league 
organization stationed at San Antonio, Tex., Shinall has time to ride only one 
wave -- baseball. He hopes it will carry him back to Los Angeles and into the 
major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a surfer since I was 9," said Shinall, a 6-foot-4 sinker-ball 
pitcher who will turn 22 in October. "In the summertime, I missed a lot of 
surfing to play baseball. But it will pay off later on. 
</P>
<P>
"There always will be another wave," he said. "In baseball you get one chance, 
and this is it for me." 
</P>
<P>
Shinall's first chance to make the big time came this spring, after three 
seasons in the minors. He was selected to the Dodgers' 40-man roster and earned 
a trip to Vero Beach, Fla., for major league training camp. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime Dodger fan, Shinall couldn't wait to play alongside the other 
Dodgers. When the 32-day baseball owners' lockout ended in March, Shinall was 
the first player to report. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unbelievable feeling to be in the locker room with the other 
players," he said. "I became friends with Mike Munoz, John Wetteland and Mike 
Hartley. I got along well with everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Shinall was also one of the first players the Dodgers cut. 
</P>
<P>
A long shot to make the team, he had little time to impress the Dodgers' 
coaching staff. He pitched four scoreless innings, giving up only two walks and 
one hit. With his last pitch, he got Darryl Strawberry to hit into an 
inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers had already decided to send Shinall to San Antonio, a wasteland 
for aspiring surfers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really hard to make the club because it was a short training camp," 
Shinall said. "I was going at 100% while the rest of the pitchers were trying 
to get in shape. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Tommy (Lasorda) calling me to his office. He said he enjoyed having 
me here and that I was being reassigned to the double-A club." 
</P>
<P>
Shinall was sent to play for the San Antonio Missions in the Texas League and 
spend the summer in such non-beach cities as Little Rock, Ark., Tulsa, Okla., 
and Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
It's the farthest he's ever been away from the surf. 
</P>
<P>
Shinall grew up in the South Bay area. When he attended El Segundo High, he 
spent his lunch breaks surfing at El Porto Beach. During his junior year, he 
won his first age-bracket surfing tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I think surfing kept me in the best possible shape for baseball," Shinall 
said. "I built up my arm strength from paddling out to the waves." 
</P>
<P>
In his senior year at El Segundo, Shinall had an impressive 13-4 record and a 
1.94 earned-run average, but he was not drafted. 
</P>
<P>
After earning all-conference honors at El Camino, however, Shinall was selected 
by the Dodgers in the 29th round of the June, 1987, free-agent draft. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily a starting pitcher, Shinall was moved to the bullpen during his third 
minor league season, with the Dodgers' Class-A team at Vero Beach. In 47 games, 
he was 5-7 with seven saves and a 2.51 ERA. He walked only 29 batters in 86 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
The previous season, at Bakersfield, Shinall had walked 104 batters in 113 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a short man, I learned to throw strikes," Shinall said. "I discovered it 
was more important to go after a hitter by getting him to ground out." 
</P>
<P>
At Vero Beach, in addition to playing baseball, Shinall also got a chance to 
surf once a week. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he's in San Antonio, Shinall's summer has been a long, rough ride on 
and off the disabled list. He missed a month with a torn muscle in his right 
forearm, then missed two starts with a broken little finger on his right hand. 
In six starts, he has a 3-0 record with a 2.95 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say that I wouldn't get the injuries if I had a chance to surf," 
Shinall said. "You can be in the best shape and still get hurt. Just look at 
Orel (Hershiser). He did his exercises and he blew out his arm." 
</P>
<P>
Shinall remains optimistic that he will get called up, because the Dodgers need 
a fifth starting pitcher. Teammate Jim Poole, a left-handed reliever, was 
promoted earlier this season from San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know when they'll be looking for another pitcher," Shinall said. 
"Everyone (on the San Antonio pitching staff) realized that eyes were opened 
when Jim got called up." 
</P>
<P>
Shinall hopes to get the call in September, when major league rosters expand to 
40 players. Then he will be able to enjoy at least part of another endless 
summer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Former Toro honored: Rick Davis of the Riverside Red Wave was selected Pitcher 
of the Week in the Class-A California League last week by Howe SportsData 
International. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a former Cal State Dominguez Hills standout, had a win and a no-decision 
last week against the San Jose Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"He really doesn't give up hits very much," said Riverside pitching coach Steve 
Luebber. "The ones he does give up are two- or three-hoppers through the 
infield. He rarely gives up a home run." 
</P>
<P>
Davis throws a knuckle curve, a pitch that only a few major leaguers have been 
able to master. During his senior year at Dominguez Hills, he set a California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. record with 171 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Although his knuckle curve is still effective, Davis has found it harder to 
strike out batters at the Class-A level. 
</P>
<P>
"In college, they would hit (the knuckle curve only) once in a while," he said. 
"I can still get the first or second strike with it. But with two strikes, the 
batters here are going to put the bat on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
In 10 appearances before this week's games, Davis had a 4-4 record with a 2.91 
ERA. On Tuesday, against San Bernardino, he earned his fifth victory, giving up 
eight hits and two earned runs in seven innings.

If your hunger for NBA action didn't end when the Detroit Pistons defeated the 
Portland Trailblazers last month, another season of basketball action starts 
tonight at Loyola Marymount's Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Summer Professional Basketball League, which draws some 
of the NBA's top rookies and free agents, opens play for the next four weeks 
with a doubleheader at 6 p.m. Most of the players are trying to impress scouts 
who are seeking to fill roster openings on National Basketball Assn. or 
European teams. 
</P>
<P>
After today's doubleheader, at least four games will be played daily. 
</P>
<P>
In tonight's opening game, the Clippers, minus top draft pick Bo Kimble, will 
play the NBA Vets. At 8:15, the NBA Stars, led by the Lakers' Byron Scott, play 
the NBA Pros, led by John Williams, the former Crenshaw High standout who plays 
for the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's schedule of five games begins at 11:15 a.m. and Sunday's schedule 
starts at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson and Michael Cooper of the Lakers, Dominique Wilkins of the 
Atlanta Hawks and Isiah Thomas of the Pistons have been known to play a game or 
two to stay sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Two teams to keep an eye on are the Lakers, coached by one of their assistant 
coaches, and the Canadian Olympians, made up of that country's official entry 
in the 1992 Olympic Games.

Ballot-Stuffing: Cincinnati financier Carl H. Lindner Jr. skewed results of a 
USA Today call-in poll to favor real estate mogul Donald Trump, the newspaper 
said Thursday. The June poll showed that 5,640 of 7,802 calls came from two 
phone numbers at a subsidiary of Lindner's American Financial Corp. A 
spokeswoman for Lindner said Lindner admires Trump's "entrepreneurial spirit."

House Report: Lindy Boggs reportedly will not seek reelection to her New 
Orleans congressional seat. She has been under increasing strain because of the 
cancer of her elder daughter, Barbara Sigmund, friends of the family say. The

decision today. Boggs won a special election in March, 1973, to succeed her 
husband, Hale Boggs, the powerful House majority leader whose plane disappeared

Whaddya Bid?: Personal possessions of former billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt -- 
including a ranch, porcelain art figures and a popcorn popper -- will be 
auctioned Saturday. Hunt and brother William Herbert Hunt, who sought 
bankruptcy protection when their silver fortune collapsed a decade ago, were 
ordered to sell the goods to pay creditors. Trustee Carter Pate in Westlake, 
Tex., called the auction "distasteful for all parties involved."

Fun at Last: Gymnastics is not the same these days for Olympic gold medalist 
Mary Lou Retton, 22. "Now I perform, I don't compete, and that makes a real 
difference," said Retton, who will be married in December. In Los Angeles, she 
won a gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in the all-around competition, the 
first ever for an American woman gymnast. Now she performs six to eight times a 
year and travels as a motivational speaker. "When we were practicing for the 
Olympics, we spent eight hours a day in the gym," she said in New Orleans. "We 
were too tired to do anything else."

THE STATE OF LITHUANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reading the article "Vilnius: An Exodus From Rebirth" (July 9), I was surprised 
that writer Esther Schrader did not mention that Vilnius was not always the 
capital of Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1919 and 1939, Vilnius was a Polish City called Vilno. The capital of 
Lithuania was Kaunas. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians worked very closely with the German occupation forces (after 
1939) and were always in assistance when a ghetto in Poland was eliminated. No 
wonder the Jews are leaving Vilnius. They do not trust the Lithuanians.

FILM: MARLON BRANDO PULLS OFF A COUP BY SLYLY PARODYING HIS 'GODFATHER' ROLE IN 
'THE FRESHMAN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Carmine Sabatini, the Little Italy "importer" in "The Freshman" who bears a 
striking resemblance to Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando pulls off a minor miracle. 
By all rights, watching America's finest actor parody one of his greatest roles 
should be a sorry spectacle -- a sign of artistic bankruptcy. Brando acts so 
infrequently that, when he does, you want him to do something great, something 
fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Except that he does indeed do something fresh. The role is nothing more than an 
elaborate comic turn, but he invests it with such sly knowingness and reserves 
of feeling that he gives this dinky joke-book movie a soul. Brando is doing 
here what a lot of famous actors probably wish they could do to the roles that 
made them famous (or, in Brando's case, famous again). He's using the gravity 
of his performance in "The Godfather" for comic effect, bringing out the 
absurdity that was always just under the surface of the role. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Brando's Godfather was perhaps the most heavily parodied of all 
contemporary performances. (The take-offs were a back-handed tribute.) Why 
shouldn't Brando join in the fun? What "The Freshman" demonstrates is that 
Brando can parody himself better than any of his imitators -- and still appear 
as regal as ever. 
</P>
<P>
With a Brando impersonator playing Carmine, "The Freshman" (rated PG) would 
have been a lot skimpier. It's pretty skimpy anyway and yet, just when you've 
had it with the mistimed scenes and the clunky direction, writer-director 
Andrew Bergman comes through with an inspired piece of lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the movie is a step back from Bergman's last film, "So Fine." As 
hilarious as that movie often was, it was his directorial debut, and he was 
just learning the ropes. In "The Freshman," (citywide), Bergman is still 
learning the ropes, but at least he's canny enough to cast actors (besides 
Brando) who are loose enough to respond to the script's japery. The performers' 
comic instincts are liberated by the free-wheeling goofiness. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Broderick plays Clark Kellogg, a Vermont kid who enrolls in the NYU 
Film School. When his bags are stolen on his way from the airport, Clark tracks 
down the penny ante crook (Bruno Kirby), who fast-talks his way into making 
amends by giving Clark a job introduction with his uncle Carmine. The job turns 
out to be smuggling into the country a Komodo dragon -- a giant lizard on the 
endangered species list. (An equally large, unendangered monitor lizard was 
substituted.) 
</P>
<P>
Now any movie that hinges on a smuggled giant lizard is definitely worth a 
look-see. And so is any movie that features Bert Parks as an emcee who croons 
to his swank assemblage, "There she is, your Komodo dragon." Parks also gets to 
sing "Tequila," from under an outsized sombrero, and "Maggie's Farm," in a 
version that will probably have Bob Dylan crying into his harmonica. 
</P>
<P>
Maximilian Schell turns up as a martinet chef with a Dr. Strangelove accent. As 
the NYU film professor who projects scenes from "The Godfather II" to his class 
and ecstatically mouths the actors' words, Paul Benedict is a inspired loon. 
Bergman, before he became a screenwriter ("Blazing Saddles," "The In-Laws"), 
published a doctoral thesis on American movies during the Depression. That may 
explain the affectionate-satiric tone in Benedict's scenes. This fatuous, 
trivia-engorged prof is probably Bergman's worst-case image of what he might 
have become if he had stayed in academia. 
</P>
<P>
It's a pity there isn't more film-school satire. We never get a sense of what 
kind of filmmaker Clark wants to be, what movies he likes. It's an 
undernourished role in general, and Broderick, funny and proficient as he 
sometimes is, seems miscast; he's too old, and too smart-looking, to be playing 
callow country boys. 
</P>
<P>
But he has a genuine rapport with Brando, and that gives the movie a real lift 
in their scenes together. Clark's father died when he was a kid; his stepfather 
is a bullying animal activist fanatic who cares little about his stepson, and 
so it makes sense that Clark would respond to Carmine's courtly, patrician 
largess. There's a wayward subplot about Carmine trying to marry off Clark with 
his sexually avid daughter (Penelope Ann Miller), his only child, but the 
surrogate father/son relationship between the two men is the film's emotional 
core. 
</P>
<P>
In Brando's best scene, Carmine, suspecting Clark is going to betray him to the 
feds, walks in on the boy in his dorm room and tries to strike a human 
connection. It's comical to see this bulky Mafioso in a dormitory, but, the way 
Brando plays it, it's also mysteriously moving. It's as if Carmine, without his 
royal trappings, had been reduced to a tender, beseeching old man.

SUBJECT PROPELS 'MISS EVERS' BOYS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From a certain point of view, American history is a history of scandal. In the 
lineup: the wresting of the West from American Indians, and the genocide, 
slavery, broken promises and exploitation of any number of other ethnic or 
economic minorities -- from Chinese railroad workers to incarcerated Japanese 
Americans during World War II and the struggle of Okies and undocumented 
Mexicans in the California fields. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, the civil rights record has been dismaying cases of inequality in 
the home of the brave and the land of the free. One such is what drives David 
Feldshuh's "Miss Evers' Boys," which opened Thursday at the Mark Taper Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The outrage here was sparked by the Tuskegee Study of Syphilis in the Untreated 
Negro Male (1932-72), one of the longest medical surveys ever, wherein 
impoverished syphilitic black men in Alabama's Macon County were led to believe 
they were receiving treatment for their "bad blood." Instead, without their 
knowledge or consent, they were expendably used in flawed scientific research 
and left unmedicated well after penicillin had become common treatment for the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
In the unraveling scandal, 400 black men with syphilis were given such placebos 
as government certificates of commendation and allowed to die -- sacrificed to 
"end point," meaning autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Feldshuh, a theater man and medical doctor, has fictionalized the 
situation but not the circumstances. He has reduced the 400 to an emblematic 
four and the doctors involved down to two: a white Dr. John Douglas (Charles 
Lanyer) and a black Dr. Eugene Brodus (Bennet Guillory). The nurse who cares 
for these men is Eunice Evers (Starletta DuPois), a character modeled after 
real-life nurse Eunice Rivers, a black woman who participated in the study, 
though herself somewhat ambiguously misled into believing in its moral 
propriety. 
</P>
<P>
The result is an evocative, issue-driven play, that suffers from a slight case 
of righteousness (always the danger), but written with enough dexterity to 
eschew some, if not all, of the pitfalls of docudrama. (We still get the 
projections that tell you when and where you are -- including one that reads 
Act Two.) There are no surprises in the plot and only circumstantial character 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The amiable Hodman (Mel Winkler), innocent Willie (K. Todd Freeman), kindly Ben 
(John Cothran, Jr.) and fierce Caleb (Carl Lumbly) are representational victims 
with minimal lives of their own. We hear about wives, children and 
"obligations" but do not see or feel any. Feldshuh links these men by a joint 
desire to shine as a rustic musical group, of which the ardent Willie is the 
dancer. This serves to unite them behind a common goal and, in Willie's case 
particularly, to illustrate the ravages of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
A smart move on Feldshuh's part, but also a transparent one, which defuses and 
diffuses the play, since we know from the start where all this is taking us. 
</P>
<P>
The Taper staging does little to alter that. It is well and movingly acted, but 
directed with too much predictability by Irene Lewis (who previously staged 
this play at Baltimore's Center Stage) on an uncluttered, evocative set by 
Douglas Stein, hauntingly lit by Pat Collins. 
</P>
<P>
The only room for discussion is in the morally murky role played by nurse 
Evers. Here Feldshuh chooses to give the character great latitude. We see some 
of the woman's moral dilemma, but often want to light a fire under it, since 
she knows she is living a lie and acts -- or fails to -- out of misplaced 
loyalty to a profession rather than to endangered men she loves. 
</P>
<P>
This is not impossible (indeed, it is largely what happened with the real nurse 
Rivers), but it is dramatically unconvincing, perhaps because the play has so 
greatly personalized her relationship to her patients. These are upstanding men 
shortchanged by life, willing game players whose betrayal seems all the more 
unconscionable for having been perpetrated on such decent guys. A scene in 
which Caleb is subjected to a spinal tap has an almost unbearable emotional 
veracity. But in another sense, it is dramatic counterfeit that plays on raw 
response. Plays need more valid foundations than these. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness to Feldshuh, though, he does not overdo such situations and does 
provide the play with more than carboard characters in the service of an idea. 
There is a minor but believable love interest between Caleb and Eunice; a 
tender exchange between the illiterate Ben and Eunice, who teaches him to write 
his name; and a horrifying scene of mental disintegration when the ranting 
Hodman ingests a lethal dose of turpentine after more basic voodoo has failed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The ghostly "Chorus Line-ish" closing image, briefly lifts this play out of its 
didactic realm. But even when it touches us -- and it does -- "Miss Evers' 
Boys" is an indignant look at righteous cause for indignation. If these two 
plusses don't quite add up to a minus, they do rob the drama of an ironic edge.

SUMMER JAZZ SWINGS FREE IN THE OUTDOORS 
</P>

<P>
On a sweltering summer evening, where else would you want to be than your 
friendly neighborhood park? 
</P>
<P>
Imagine it. 
</P>
<P>
Perched on a lawn chair you watch the kids fling linguine at each other while 
you work your way through a picnic dinner -- soothed by the sounds of live 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
There are countless opportunities all over San Diego County to hear live jazz 
outdoors this summer, for free, generally in public parks, the largest of which 
is the TGIF Jazz series, now being presented by the city of Carlsbad arts 
office on nine consecutive Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow night in Coronado, Fattburger kicks off six Saturday evenings of jazz 
in the park by the ferry landing. At 6 this evening in Carlsbad's Stagecoach 
Park, it's San Diego flutist Holly Hofmann. Sunday at Fashion Valley shopping 
center, Yutaka plays his Brazilian-Asian-jazz blend. Sunday afternoon from 2 to 
4 p.m., the Chicago Six serves up traditional jazz at the oceanfront Scripps 
Park in La Jolla. And the list goes on (please see box). 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the sizable city of 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has a relatively small public jazz program. The county's small towns 
outstrip the inner city in summer outdoor jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the city didn't have good intentions. A promising series in the 
amphitheater behind the downtown convention center was canceled in June after 
only a month of concerts. At their peak, these shows lured up to 1,000 people 
to hear top local bands, according to convention center Entertainment 
Coordinator Rob Huff. 
</P>
<P>
"With the new fiscal year starting in July, we had budget constraints," Huff 
said. "We had to rethink the money we were spending. We've received numerous 
letters protesting the cancellation. We'll do it again next year. We're looking 
for a sponsor; $40,000 would buy three months of jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Baritone saxophonist Ira B. Liss's Big Band Jazz Machine, who played a 
convention center date before the series was scrapped, was hired to produce 
Carlsbad's nine concerts on a budget of $6,000, and has assembled a lineup 
including flutist Hofmann, guitarist Peter Sprague, Latin/Afro-Cuban jazz band 
Afro Rumba and other local talent. 
</P>
<P>
For Liss and other musicians, the summer concerts are something special. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the outdoor concerts are beneficial because they give local musicians 
the chance to perform, and they give the public a chance to discover who's out 
there without having to go to a night club and pay a cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
"They also offer a valuable cultural experience to a cross section of people, 
from children to seniors, and every ethnic and demographic division thereof." 
</P>
<P>
Liss has intentionally slanted the Carlsbad summer series toward groups who 
play unique and original jazz rather than what's popular with the masses. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to take away from light jazz groups, because they all play music that is 
enjoyable to listen to, but I think it's important to show the general public 
that jazz isn't just one type of music that you hear on the radio. Jazz is the 
only original American music. It is wide and it has a variety of styles and 
takes in many different forms." 
</P>
<P>
Hence, Liss booked groups like Kokopelli, composed of such innovative local 
musicians as pianist Joe Garrison, trumpeter Bill Cabellero, saxman Dave 
Millard and saxophonist/flutist Turiya. All prefer plenty of room to improvise, 
and this can be risky in front of an audience which represents a cross section 
of a typical suburban neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
At last Friday night's concert by Kokopelli at Calavera Hills Park, an audience 
of several hundred ranged from those who undoubtedly heard Benny Goodman in his 
heyday to others who probably think Madonna is an old lady. Despite the range 
of people, the audience appeared to like the Latin beat, applauding after the 
solos. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do the free outdoor shows give the masses a chance to experience live 
jazz, but the musicians say they enjoy playing outside the dark, smoky night 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really sort of a fan of nature, and I like being out there with it," said 
North County guitarist Peter Sprague, who will work several outdoor dates this 
summer. "The real clincher is if the sound system is good. If so, then it feels 
good on-stage and the people love it. And the parks are kind of a holistic 
setting -- kids, dogs, people, the elements that come together. Sometimes in 
clubs, you have to be dressed up or a certain age to be there." 
</P>
<P>
"My band is especially suited to outdoor gigs," said percussionist Gene (Negro) 
Perry, leader of Afro Rumba. "That Latin beat outdoors, the drums -- it's like 
a call to the people. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been three or four outdoor shows here, but as time goes on, 
there seem to be more and more. They bring people together. It's a time to 
share the love of the music. That's why I especially like the outdoor shows." 
</P>

Rapping Ruckus: The Ft. Myers (Fla.) News-Press is being investigated by a 
state official for possible violation of Florida obscenity codes after the 
newspaper made copies of 2 Live Crew's sexually explicit lyrics available to 
adult readers. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's executive editor, Everett Landers, didn't print the lyrics in a 
June 24 editorial that supported the embattled rappers' rights to free speech, 
but offered to make copies available to adults who stopped by the newspaper 
office. More than 250 people responded. One of them, Phil M. McCorkle, filed a 
complaint with the Ft. Myers Police Department, which forwarded it to regional 
state attorney Joseph D'Alessandro. On Feb. 9, Lee County Judge Isaac Anderson 
ruled that there was "probable cause to believe" that 2 Live Crew's "As Nasty 
as They Wanna Be" was obscene. GREG BRAXTON

Beatty Checks Out of 'Doctor': Warren Beatty has dropped out of Touchstone's 
"The Doctor" due to creative differences over the script with director Randa 
Haines, Daily Variety reported on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Beatty and Disney would not comment. The newspaper also said that 
Disney has called in former Columbia Pictures head Dawn Steel to serve in a key 
production capacity on the film, which is slated to roll in September. (The 
Outtakes column in the July 22 Sunday Calendar, printed earlier this week, 
reports that Beatty is still involved in the film project.) GREG BRAXTON

STONE PLAYS 4 WORKS AT ZETA DANCE COLLECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN

<TEXT>
<P>
New music is hardly the swankiest neighborhood in the arts scene, and deep in 
the heart of the ghetto lies electronic music. Orchestras and opera companies, 
with their big houses and big crowds, seldom come calling with commissions 
there. 
</P>
<P>
But that is where much of the more imaginative and liberating work is being 
done. Thanks to home computers and the digital revolution, composers can create 
directly with sound, as improvising virtuosos in their own right, rather than 
writing down more or less specific plans for others to realize. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most technically sophisticated and artistically enlivening of such 
composers is Carl Stone. Wednesday he presented four of his latest creations as 
a compact concert, produced by the Independent Composers Assn., at a 
well-attended Zeta Dance Collective. 
</P>
<P>
Stone's pieces, bearing the names of favorite restaurants, are based on 
sequences of sampled and processed sound, which he manipulates on the spot. 
This may mean anything from relatively modest mix adjustments to full-on 
editing, with Stone doing some twitching, chair-bound dancing behind his 
computer and equipment stack. 
</P>
<P>
The composer was most involved physically in "Mom's," a hot, frenetic piece of 
cyber-salsa. The strata of clearly defined cross-meters eventually coalesced 
into a pulsating, rock-the-house rhythm track, over which Stone laid articulate 
electronic songs, goosed with raw slabs of sampled mayhem. Spatial effects, 
from speakers around the room, helped keep the texture remarkably transparent, 
as in all the pieces, be they ever so densely layered. 
</P>
<P>
"Gadberry's" proved the flip side, a cool jazz mosaic of bopping bell sounds. 
The contrasting middle section seemed abruptly shortened, making for a rather 
perfunctory structure, but the main section was wonderfully liquid and 
balanced. 
</P>
<P>
Stone began with "Chao Nue," a flowing, meditative prelude. He is a master of 
organic, Escher-like transformations, and the piece developed lyrically in 
unpredictable ways that always sounded inevitable, after the fact. The 
complexity of the permutations was balanced with a poignantly varied 
recapitulation. 
</P>
<P>
At the end came "Kong Joo," a short quasi-ethnic closer that sounded something 
like a Sino-Celtic parody of "We Will Rock You," minus all the heaviness. JOHN

STAGE BEAT: SHARI BELAFONTE TAKES A TURN IN THE 'TAMARA' ROTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's face it. The real fun of "Tamara" is sipping champagne and racing around 
an old house. 
</P>
<P>
The show's into its 7th year and costs $85 to see on a Saturday night. How does 
one explain its success? One answer is that the experience is like following 
actors around a sprawling movie set. You're free to make as many close-ups as 
you want, select what scenes to follow (as many as seven are going on at once) 
and later talk to the actors who will fill you in on the sexual, domestic or 
political intrigue you missed. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of seven years, some of the actors have been pretty big names 
(Anjelica Huston, Karen Black, Theresa Saldana, Shelley Hack, William 
Schallert). There have been at least a half-dozen Tamaras. The latest title 
character at Il Vittoriale (through the end of the month) is Shari Belafonte, 
who's making her stage debut. 
</P>
<P>
Tamara is a Polish aristocrat and artist, who's a catalyst in the show but, 
curiously, among the least interesting of the characters and most difficult to 
perform. That's because she's not crazed. She's a noble cut above all this 
pre-Fascist decadence. 
</P>
<P>
The actress playing her needs to be alluring, mysterious, a bit haughty and 
shimmering. Belafonte hasn't found that yet. She gives the impression she's 
playing high drama. She's too rigorous and severe. Director Richard Rose should 
utilize her Calvin Klein demeanor. It would be a great ironic note. Her French 
(which accounts for most of her lines) is excellent, but in this hothouse 
atmosphere Belafonte should chill out. Also, her costume (thanks a lot, 
designer Gianfranco Ferre) is unforgiveably drab. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, this is an ensemble show, it has not worn down and is still a 
phenomenon of environmental theater. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2035 N. Highland Ave., Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; matinees Saturdays 
and Sundays, 2 p.m., indefinitely. $65-$85; (213) 851-9999. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ace Acting Almost Saves Version of 'The Big Knife' 
</P>
<P>
The best way to stage Clifford Odets' 1949 Hollywood drama, "The Big Knife," is 
to light it darkly, as in film noir. Otherwise, Odets' three acts are too 
turgid. 
</P>
<P>
At the Gene Dynarski Theater, under a new production ensemble directed by 
Dynarski himself, the setting is splashed in bright light. We don't want 
Technicolor. We want evil if we can get it. 
</P>
<P>
The play is about the machinations of a studio mogul who ruins the life of his 
top male star, a fierce portrayal by Sal Landi, whose stature grows in the 
course of the three acts. (John Garfield, in the haunting irony of a role that 
captured his own crisis at Universal at the time, created the part on 
Broadway). 
</P>
<P>
What's fascinating about "The Big Knife," despite the fact that everybody talks 
too much, is that its characters are recognizable and it's juicy Hollywood 
bashing. The corrupt mogul must be insidious, unctuous, not a cartoon, and it's 
here that Dynarski has cast his ace: Albert Paulsen, whose rich, unstressed, 
masterful performance, in a trimmed script, might have salvaged the production. 
</P>
<P>
Three other actors in the 12-member cast are also exceptional: Richard Issacs' 
wimpy buddy, Stanley Brock's loyal agent and Gary Swanson's studio hatchet man. 
Swanson takes a hackneyed role and remains so blissfully in callow character 
that you strangely come to like the guy. 
</P>
<P>
The rest is uneven: the women are mostly overripe. The two intermissions are a 
killer. Stepanie Schoelzel's costumes (those ladies' gloves are a nice detail) 
are '40s chic, but the expansive, sunny game room by set designer Robert Howell 
misses the play's mood. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5600 Sunset Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m., 
indefinitely. $8-$14; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Choice Family Fare in Two-Hour 'Huck Finn' 
</P>
<P>
"Huck Finn" belongs outdoors, and at The Theatricum Botanicum, in the 
production's best, less harried moments, you feel the serenity of the river. 
Huck and Jim float on a raft (on rollers), and in the glade of the Botanicum, 
caves and shoreline are easy to imagine. 
</P>
<P>
This production, with adapter John Barnes wisely cutting the Twain classic down 
to a two-hour playing length, is choice family entertainment. For once Huck (a 
convincing Ross Carrick) is not red-haired and freckled and British director 
Douglas Campbell has caught the growing morality in Huck with an unpatronizing 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Dane's sturdy Jim, Thad Geer's drunken Pap, and Peter Zazzali's 
hair-brained Tom Sawyer are strong support. Those scalawags, the King and Duke, 
are flavorfully played by, respectively, Arthur Malet and David Ellenstein. You 
see their bodies tarred and feathered -- this production doesn't hedge on the 
brutality of small-town 19th-Century America -- and Campbell and Barnes are 
careful to make clear that Huck feels sorry for them. A telling nuance. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1419 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd., Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 1 p.m., through

Zeta Collective Targets Mindless Patriotism 
</P>
<P>
The first thing a child memorizes in school is the pledge of allegiance. The 
Zeta Collective, in a short, provocative ensemble performance, dramatizes the 
symbols and language of patriotism in "Myths of Freedom 2: Ready! Begin!" at 
the L.A. Fringe Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Based in a warehouse in downtown Los Angeles, with a deep stage perfectly 
suited to its dance movement theater, the multidisciplinary company decimates 
mindless patriotism through corporeal mime and robotic movements. 
</P>
<P>
Over the image of smiling white masks, we hear a tape playing words in German 
from "Mein Kampf." We also hear a 6th grade class reciting slogans at 92nd 
Street School and knee-jerk gung ho refrains from Ronald Reagan and George 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But the impact is nonverbal, with the ensemble's hypnotic and highly technical 
movement fusing images of flying air squadrons, military processions, salutes, 
warfare, crumbling bodies, tolling bells. Implicit in the material is the 
current flag desecration flap. 
</P>
<P>
The first half hour of the 50-minute production is so darkly lit that the 
result is unnecessarily stark and distancing. But the Zeta Collective is a 
group with a clear point of view that is never strident. Director William 
Fisher founded the company in Paris under the influence of corporeal mime 
artist Etienne Decroux and brought it to downtown Los Angeles three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At 929 E. Second St. (entrance on Vignes), Fridays through Sundays, 8:30 p.m., 
through July 29. $8-$10; (213) 617-8259. 
</P>

<P>
A Family Romp With an Environmental Message 
</P>
<P>
Steve Trash is the name. He lives in a back alley of garbage and uncorks magic 
tricks with an implicit environmental message about recycling, particularly 
aimed at kids. 
</P>
<P>
At a brisk hour and 15 minutes, the show at Theater/Theatre is whimsical, 
educational, and the magic will impress any adult, especially the levitating 
bag lady (Heather Sandvold, who co-wrote the show with Trash and director 
Nadine Caracciolo). 
</P>
<P>
Trash, alias Steve Richerson from New York, may be the first illusionist to 
create magic in the context of the refuse and homeless. All the props are 
comical. There's no rotten fruit or anything repellent. Trash doesn't rush 
things. And he's not a showoff. Here's a loony, socially alert family frolic. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1713 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Saturdays, 3 and 8 p.m., Sundays, 5 and 8 p.m., 
through Aug. 5. $8.50-$15; (213) 871-0210.

<P>
'Evolution of a Rib' Needs a Bit of Beefing Up 
</P>
<P>
A one-woman show, "Evolution of a Rib," at the Powerhouse Theater, is a 
showcase for Carra Robertson, who segues from a modern-day Eve in a 
flesh-colored body suit to four young women in assorted stages of angst, 
comical and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
The production, directed by Allyson Adams and written by Robertson and 
Stephanie Phillips, is a rather slight achievement. We really don't need 
another unloving mom and dad sketch. 
</P>
<P>
The production is disciplined and technically professional and breezes by in an 
hour. But one-person shows need bite, edge, and danger. The eager Robertson has 
personality and stage savvy, but she doesn't explore any new territory as a 
writer, and as an actress, which is her forte, her characters and caricatures 
are not original enough to make knockout punches. 
</P>
<P>
This rib needs meat. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3116 Second St., Santa Monica. Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 p.m., through 
Aug. 22. $10; (213) 842-8617.

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'MEN DON'T LEAVE' HAS ARRIVED WITH JESSICA 
LANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Lange shines as a mother of two sons who must adjust to a new life 
after her husband's death in "Men Don't Leave" (Warner, $89.95, PG-13). The 
warm, touching and funny comedy-drama from earlier this year -- writer-director 
Paul Brickman's first film since his more acidic "Risky Business" -- also 
features Arliss Howard, Chris O'Donnell and another enchanting performance by 
Joan Cusack. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Home Video also has two vintage movies for fans of '50s blond sigh-guy 
Troy Donahue -- and of pre-R-rated young-folk romance. "A Summer Place" (1959) 
finds Troy snuggling up to equally blond Sandra Dee. Most notable for its Max 
Steiner-written theme song (a big hit) and its lush color photography (by Harry 
Stradling), this young-love-in-New-England drama is soapy but not too dopey. 
Except maybe for its length (130 minutes). 
</P>
<P>
Dopier but mildly enjoyable (and a half-hour shorter) is "Palm Springs Weekend" 
(1963). Troy's co-star this time (blond again, of course) is the bouncy Connie 
Stevens, and they're supposed to be, uh, teen-agers. It's not a great picture 
by any means, but still easier to take than the R-rated teen "comedies" of a 
later and less innocent time. 
</P>
<P>
The best new oldie, though, is also the best (and first) Lassie film, "Lassie 
Come Home" (MGM/UA, $19.98). The 1943 heart-tugger stars the very young 
Elizabeth Taylor and Roddy McDowall. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW ARRIVALS: "Homer and Eddie" (HBO, $89.99, R) stars James Belushi and 
Whoopi Goldberg is a 1989 drama about an odd couple who journey across the 
country together. "Mad About You" (Academy, $89.95, PG) is a sweet if minor 
1989 romantic comedy about a young woman (Claudia Christian) and the men in her 
life (ranging from a football player to a musician). "Streets" (MGM/UA, $89.98, 
R) stars Christina Applegate (TV's "Married . . . With Children") in a rough 
1990 story about a teen-age prostitute, a cop and a serial killer. "Primary 
Target" (MGM/UA, $89.98, R) is another imitation-"Rambo," jungle-rescue flick 
(from 1989) starring John Calvin. 
</P>
<P>
COMING ATTRACTIONS: "Chinese Roulette" (Aug. 16), "Nuns on the Run" (Aug. 23), 
"The Handmaid's Tale" (Sept. 5), "House Party" (Sept. 5), "Impulse" (Sept. 12), 
"The Hunt for Red October" (Oct. 25), "Martians Go Home" (Sept. 27), "Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie" (Oct. 4). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
For kids, Golden Book Video is releasing two award-winning, 1978 Claymation 
versions of the classic tales "Rip Van Winkle" (narrated by Will Geer) and "The 
Little Prince" (narrated by Cliff Robertson). Each half-hour tapes costs $9.95.

FRESH PREMISE, RERUN CHARACTERS IN VIDEO SITCOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the annals of really goofy ideas for TV sitcoms, CBS' offbeat summer series 
"Wish You Were Here" is bound to rank high. The hook is that the show's 
wise-cracking protagonist, who has shot a running video commentary on his 
extended overseas vacation, is seen only on tape, through the eyes of friends 
and family back home who get the cassettes in the mail. He's supposed to be a 
one-man "America's Funniest Home Video." 
</P>
<P>
In tonight's premiere (at 9:30 on channels 2 and 8), the first tape from 
laugh-a-second Donny Cogswell arrives in the mail for pert, shallow Janet, his 
ex-girlfriend. As she watches it on her VCR, Donny -- a self-voyeur who likes 
to shoot everything -- tests his new purchase at an electronics store, quits 
his stockbroker job later that day, gets dumped by Janet still later that day, 
and flies on a whim to Paris, where he attempts to woo from afar this woman who 
jilted him so casually. 
</P>
<P>
This is ambitious in concept, and it's easy to see why it interested such 
behind-the-scenes movers as executive producers Robert Altman, Marlo Thomas and 
Kathie Berlin. But however unusual the format, the comic riffs in this episode, 
at least, are all too familiar. Donny (played by Lew Schneider) is a hyped-up 
Tom Hanks type. Janet (Leah Lail) is a stuck-up Swoosie Kurtz type. Her new 
boyfriend, Ted (Michael Mulheren), who stops by and watches a little, is an 
unctuous-yuppie Jeff Daniels type. 
</P>
<P>
The format also leaves plenty of room for Donny to be a David Letterman type as 
well, a self-consciously ugly American in Paris who badgers the locals about, 
among other things, the meaning of amour. But unlike Letterman, his mockery is 
so manic that it quickly wears you out, leaving you to ask questions like: How 
does he manage to hold the camera so it's always trained on his face? How does 
he do such nimble cross-editing with a single camera? And wasn't life a lot 
less narcissistic in the pre-camcorder age?

DESERT OPERA PUTS ON A LOW-BUDGET, HIGH-SPIRIT PRODUCTION OF 'A CHORUS LINE'; 
</P>
<P>
'WHAT'S MONEY WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first song of the ultimate backstage musical, "A Chorus Line," the 
performers repeatedly sing the line, "I really need this job!" 
</P>
<P>
That is not true, at least monetarily, for the 23 performers of the Desert 
Opera Theatre's production of the musical opening tonight at the Palmdale 
Cultural Center. Even though they have gone through almost two months of 
rehearsals and are commuting from as far away as Hollywood, none of the 
performers are being paid. 
</P>
<P>
"What's money when you're having fun?" asked Karen Rhodes, dripping with sweat 
and sarcasm during a break in an arduous rehearsal at an auditorium that is all 
that is left of an old elementary school. Rhodes, cast as the tough-talking 
Sheila in the musical, is one of the latest in a long line of performers who 
have taken the stage under the auspices of the Palmdale-based Desert Opera, now 
in its 19th year. 
</P>
<P>
Desert Opera has grown, in its almost two decades, from a few singers who would 
give recitals at an elementary school to an organization that mounts three 
fully staged productions a year. Like its burgeoning hometown of Palmdale, the 
troupe has lofty hopes for the future. During its third decade, Desert Opera 
hopes to become the first professional, resident opera/musical company in the 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Look how this area has grown just in the last few years," said David Milligan, 
the artistic director of Desert Opera. Milligan, a former church musician who 
is now a car salesman, is the producer and musical conductor of "A Chorus 
Line." 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready for this," he continued. "No one up here should have to drive to 
Los Angeles for their only chance to see live opera or musicals. And it's time 
for us to have something that will expose our young people to this kind of 
music and theater." 
</P>
<P>
Milligan acknowledged that Desert Opera is still far from fulfilling its dream 
of going professional. Many of the performers in its productions have little 
stage experience, the budgets for its productions are relatively small and the 
troupe has no well-equipped stage on which to work. The auditorium where they 
rehearse has no fly space to store sets, only minimal lights and no 
air-conditioning. The cultural center, where they will perform, is a banquet 
hall with a stage at one end. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Desert Opera were dealt a major setback July 13 when the Palmdale 
City Council abruptly canceled long-held plans to build a 700-seat theater. 
Even though the land on which the new theater was to sit was being donated, a 
majority of council members thought the construction costs were too high. 
</P>
<P>
It was a disappointment for the Desert Opera forces. But they have a long 
history of making do under less than ideal conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got here there was no place to sing in the entire valley, no organized 
group to sing with," said Anita Baeke, founder of Desert Opera. A former opera 
singer who had performed with community groups in New Jersey, she started the 
troupe in 1971, soon after moving to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I was giving voice music lessons and there was real talent here, but it was 
frustrating that the students had no place to perform," she said. "I decided 
that if there was going to be an opera company, I would have to start one." 
</P>
<P>
Baeke thought two soprano students were ready for public performances. She 
found a tenor and baritone to round out the troupe and staged selections from 
"Cosi Fan Tutte" and "La Boheme" at an elementary school in nearby Lancaster. 
Later that year they repeated the performance in a 99-seat recital room at 
Antelope Valley College, this time armed with homemade costumes and rudimentary 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a production of Engelbert Humperdinck's "Hansel and Gretel" that 
Baeke put together for a local festival in 1973, Desert Opera continued its 
policy of doing only scenes from operas until 1977, when she put on a full 
production of "The Marriage of Figaro." 
</P>
<P>
"We used some professional singers out of Newhall and Saugus who wanted the 
opportunity to polish a role," Baeke said. "We paid the professionals an 
honorarium, mostly to help with the mileage." 
</P>
<P>
Baeke left the opera company in 1984 to work for the city to develop plans and 
funding sources for a new theater. 
</P>
<P>
The opera company continued on, switching venues a few times until it ended up 
at the cultural center, which it shares with several other groups. This can 
cause problems. Last Spring its production of Gian Carlo Menotti's opera "The 
Medium" was mistakenly scheduled at the same time the hall was supposed to be 
used for an earthquake preparedness seminar. 
</P>
<P>
The seminar won. Desert Opera rescheduled "The Medium" for next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Milligan, 36, who grew up in Pasadena and has a master's degree in music 
performance from Cal State Northridge, became active in the company in 1985, 
shortly after moving to the Antelope Valley. "They were doing 'Cavalleria 
Rusticana' and they needed a conductor on short notice," he said. "I stepped in 
to work on it and stayed on." 
</P>
<P>
It was a time of transition for Desert Opera. "We were starting to use 
orchestra players instead of just a piano," Milligan said. "And we were 
starting to think about doing works from musical theater." 
</P>
<P>
Even the major opera companies have turned to musicals in recent years to 
bolster their incomes. Los Angeles Music Center Opera recently did its first 
musical, "Oklahoma!" New York City Opera has been doing them regularly for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Desert Opera did "Paint Your Wagon" in 1986, followed by summer productions of 
"Man of La Mancha" and "My Fair Lady." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the musicals that go into the black," Milligan said. "They help to 
support the opera productions." Desert Opera now generally schedules one 
musical and two operas or operettas per season. 
</P>
<P>
It was Milligan's choice to do "A Chorus Line," a musical that closed earlier 
this year in New York after the longest run in Broadway history. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of my favorite shows," he said. "And it's something we can do in the 
facility we have to use. The show is all confined to basically one set. Even 
though the lighting can get complicated, we can handle that as long as the set 
is confined." 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that putting on the show is an easy task for Desert Opera. 
The budget, which is earmarked mainly for the set and for musicians' salaries, 
is $14,000 -- small by musical production standards but still a considerable 
sum. It will come out of Desert Opera's season budget of about $55,000, which 
is funded by local industries and through ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
The show has a considerable amount of profanity and deals with issues and 
situations that would not make it Sen. Jesse Helms favorite night in the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect we'll get some adverse reaction," said Milligan. "That's the risk 
whenever you do something beyond the bounds of what some people consider 
wholesome. But this show deals with real people and real situations, and 
sometimes people don't like that." 
</P>
<P>
"I think some people are going to freak," said Gaylord, who also plays the role 
of Paul in the show. Paul has a speech about performing in drag clubs before 
becoming a dancer. "There are going to be people who are a little shocked," he 
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The show, as originally directed by Michael Bennett, is a tough one for even 
highly accomplished dancers. But some of the performers in the Desert Opera "A 
Chorus Line" have had little experience in dance. 
</P>
<P>
"My specialty, I think, is to work with people who don't dance," said the 
show's director and choreographer, John Gaylord. "Even non-dancers can learn a 
lot in a few intense weeks if we work with them." 
</P>
<P>
Gaylord previously directed the show at a dinner theater and was dance captain 
for a production at Ventura College. During rehearsals he also was commuting to 
Disneyland, where he performed in the Mardi Gras parade. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest problem that Milligan has to deal with is the 23-member 
cast, several of whom have only limited stage experience. Some do not have 
dancers' physiques. And although some are working toward having a theatrical 
career, many are just doing the show for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the actors have outside jobs, and include a lawyer, room service 
waiter, bank teller and temporary office worker. 
</P>
<P>
To help them get into the roles, Milligan asks them to stay in character 
whenever they are at rehearsal and always call each other by their character 
names, even when not on stage. Unfortunately, because there are some 
contentious characters in "A Chorus Line," it can make rehearsals rocky. 
</P>
<P>
During a run-through of the big ensemble number, "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, 
Hello Love," Rhodes, in a manner befitting Shiela told Milligan that she felt 
rehearsals were being handled in an unprofessional manner. For several minutes, 
while the rest of the cast stood around on stage looking uncomfortable, she 
told him that she was so scared that the show would not be in shape by opening 
night that she was thinking of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Milligan listened stoicly and then continued the rehearsal with little comment. 
</P>
<P>
When the four-hour rehearsal was over, several cast members gathered on the 
front steps of the auditorium to talk, even though many were facing long drives 
home. When Milligan came out, Rhodes grabbed him and gave him a hug. "I really 
love this man," she said. "I just get so tired and crazy with all that driving 
and everything. I get nasty sometimes." They laughed and made up. 
</P>
<P>
After he had gone, Rhodes, who had previously performed the part of Sheila at a 
dinner theater production of "A Chorus Line," was ready to answer the question 
of why she was willing to drive to Palmdale from Beverly Glen several nights a 
week to rehearse and perform for no pay. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this body, honey. It is not one that is going to get me into the 
Joffrey Ballet," said Rhodes, who earns her living by working on film crews. 
"But I love this show. I love Sheila. I love doing it. Where else am I going to 
get the chance to do this role?" 
</P>
<P>
The first song in "A Chorus Line" might contain the line "I really need this 
job," but the last song, right before the big finale, is called, "What I Did 
for Love." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Chorus Line" opens tonight at the Palmdale Cultural Center, 704 E. Palmdale 
Blvd., Palmdale. 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 2 p.m. Sundays through Aug. 5. 
Tickets are $9. For information, call (805) 273-0512.

GLENDALE GRILL OFFERS A BOARDROOM LOOK BUT A GREAT BURGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opening a restaurant and stuck for a name? Why not call it the Anywhere Grill? 
An actual grill is not required. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not implying that the Glendale Grill, an upbeat-concept restaurant in the 
old Rusty Scupper area, doesn't serve grilled dishes. They do have a few, but 
not really so you'd notice. 
</P>
<P>
The place is owned and managed by Stouffer, which might account for a certain 
generic quality. The dining room has a glossy boardroom ambience, like an 
upscale cafeteria dressed up for dinner: all sharp angles and blond wood on the 
outside in the Finnish sauna mode, stark white and spacious inside. Only a 
soaring ceiling saves it from looking like the executive dining room of a large 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the restaurant might be a bit daunting. It's a free-standing building 
amid a jumble of high-rises several blocks north of downtown Glendale. Enter 
through the garage, rather than between the buildings, or you could miss the 
sign (I did) and find yourself walking in circles around an office complex. 
</P>
<P>
The transparent plastic menu, with its computer paper inserts, has a glossy 
look itself. It's filled with appetizing selections, and at the busy lunch hour 
it moves a lot of trendy sandwiches, exotic salads and good, intelligently 
conceived pizzas. In the evening, when things are far more subdued, the grilled 
items and fresh seafoods are more popular. Should you wish, say, pizza for 
dinner or seafood for lunch, there shouldn't be any problem, because much the 
same menu is served throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
You might want to start with a buzzword sandwich such as the muffaletta, made 
with prosciutto, salami, provolone cheese and an olive pate. This isn't the 
sandwich you'll get at Central Grocery in New Orleans -- the pate is far too 
creamy and lacks bite. But it is served on a round of fresh, oily focaccia 
bread, and it does make a savory lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale burger comes on the same bread and is even better. The meat is 
fresh and tasty, and I liked the combination of grilled peppers and provolone 
with the garlic and Dijon mustard glaze underneath. It's one of the more 
interesting burgers I've tasted in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Salads come in large glass bowls and tend to be more show than substance; 
they're attractive but short on flavor. Caesar salad, for instance, is a 
creamy, passable Caesar crowned by a slightly overcooked piece of grilled 
chicken breast. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Thai beef and grilled vegetable salad is one to consider: a large 
chunk of garlic-marinated beef, sliced London broil style atop greens with 
grilled onions and peppers. It's a good concept, but without ginger, lemon 
grass, mint or indeed any of the herbs or spices Thais use in their cooking, 
its name is pretty misleading. 
</P>
<P>
Heartier appetites will want to start with a crusty pizza or one of the 
appetizers. The four-cheese pizza is properly gooey and pungent. The best 
appetizer, hands down, is Glendale Grill chili, a thick, meaty dish of ground 
chuck and Italian sausage. It isn't at all spicy, but the sausage gives it a 
distinctive flavor. 
</P>
<P>
An appetizer called shrimp with four-pepper sauce isn't bad, either, but the 
menu description totally misleads us. It claims the sauce contains green 
peppercorns, cayenne and two kinds of black pepper (Malabar and Tellicherry). 
Whatever it contained was fine with me, but the stuff looked and tasted like 
green apple sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The grilled dishes are almost twice the price of the sandwiches and salads -- 
and about half as interesting. The grilled shrimp, for instance, have a neutral 
flavor, bedded on an oily rice pilaf with abundant chopped nuts. There's a pork 
chop that tastes as if it could have come from any coffee shop. The grilled 
chicken breast tends to be overcooked and the sauces -- herb, barbecue and 
Parmesan -- taste no different from the ones in frozen entrees. Only the big, 
juicy cut of prime rib scores high. 
</P>
<P>
There are three house-made desserts, two of which merit attention. One is Toll 
House pie, a Mrs. Fields-like cookie batter in a pie crust featuring Nestle's 
chocolate bits, topped with vanilla ice cream and a rich chocolate sauce. The 
other is the house specialty, a steamed chocolate pudding served piping hot. 
This is really like an English tea cake that has been steamed in a jar: soft 
and fudgey, with a scoop of molten hard sauce running down its sides like lava. 
</P>
<P>
As for the fresh fruit trifle, a gloopy melange in a cocktail glass, forget it 
altogether. Or better yet, send it on up to the executive dining room.

<P>
It was a moment some had spent more than a decade waiting to see: Richard M. 
Nixon standing once again behind the royal blue presidential seal, beaming 
widely as thousands of friends and admirers cheered. 
</P>
<P>
"He's meant a lot to some of us who are older," said Margaret Chambers, 72, of 
Fullerton. "I used to work for him in Garden Grove going door to door." 
</P>
<P>
Lupe Westrup, an English teacher at a private school in Brea, also watched with 
history on her mind as the former President, arms at his sides, took the 
lectern and gratefully acknowledged a long ovation. In the presidential 
election of 1960, Westrup said, she was one of the only people in her 
neighborhood who backed Nixon against John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
"They stoned my house, they punctured my tires and they egged my house," she 
said. "Today, 30 years later, made it worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
Though Nixon loyalists dominated Thursday's crowd, they did not own it. Others 
braved long lines and the sweltering heat just for the chance to see the rare 
gathering of four Presidents on a single stage, and a few took advantage of the 
occasion to air their political grievances. 
</P>
<P>
There were visitors who traveled thousands of miles to see the ceremony and 
visitors who camped overnight to secure prime seats. Once inside the library 
compound, everybody had to wait in line for up to an hour to shuffle through a 
security check that included metal detectors. Still, few seemed to leave 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll never see four Presidents all together like this," said Pat Yates, a 
Tustin resident. "It's history in the making." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's crowd of 50,000 was overwhelmingly supportive of Nixon and his 
fellow Republicans, but pockets of protesters were sprinkled throughout. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators -- whose causes ranged from AIDS to abortion rights, from the 
environment to Central America -- clashed with Nixon backers in a few places, 
exchanging harsh words but stopping short of blows. 
</P>
<P>
Although tempers occasionally flared and temperatures hit 90 degrees, Yorba 
Linda absorbed the huge crowd -- more visitors than had ever descended on the 
city in a single day, local leaders figured -- and handled it without serious 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all gone very smoothly from our perspective," said Brea Police Lt. 
Chester Panique. "It was hot, but so far we've just had a couple of minor 
incidents and no arrests." 
</P>
<P>
During the speeches, while some visitors scambled up bleachers and flagpoles 
for a better look, children waded barefoot into the library fountain and the 
reflecting pool behind the library to take the edge off the heat. Dignitaries 
decked out in suits and silk dresses rolled up their sleeves and spent the 
morning fanning themselves with white programs. 
</P>
<P>
The sun was a little easier to take for the Presidents and First Ladies, whose 
stage included several air conditioners that occasionally blew a few wisps of 
hair out of place. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Steinkraus, a Red Cross emergency medical technician in charge of a 
first-aid tent behind the bleachers, on Thursday afternoon wearily tended to 
heat-stricken visitors who lay on cots or paused in the shade to sit on chairs 
and tables. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been like this all day," Steinkraus said, adding that Red Cross workers 
had treated at least 100 people for minor heat exhaustion. Two -- a pregnant 
woman and an elderly woman -- were sent to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is that they (the dedication organizers) didn't provide 
enough water for people to drink," he said. "There were a lot of people here 
today, and unfortunately, we can't supply water to 100,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
Police estimates ran lower than that, but the heat was made all the more 
oppressive by the huge number of visitors who attended Thursday's dedication. 
Brea police, who handle Yorba Linda's law enforcement duties, said the line of 
people trying to get into the event at one point stretched for two miles. 
Almost 40,000 visitors passed through the metal detectors, and police estimated 
that another 10,000 people came to town, took a look at the crowd and headed 
home. 
</P>
<P>
That created long lines of traffic, as well as boom-town business for area 
merchants, some of whom had decorated their establishments for the occasion. 
Residents near the line outside the library sold muffins, rolls and orange 
juice, while area stores rented out parking spaces for as much as $20 each. 
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon the streets were returning to normal and nearly all of the 
visitors had worked their way out of the city. On the way, many stopped long 
enough to scoop up Nixon T-shirts, hats, buttons and other memorabilia from 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, a longtime Nixon admirer whose 1988 
speech at the Republican National Convention won high praise from the former 
President, picked his way back to his office Thursday afternoon and glowingly 
pronounced the day a historic success. 
</P>
<P>
"This was really magnificent," said Vasquez, who brought his 11-year-old son to 
Thursday's event so the youngster could see Nixon in person. "To see the 
twinkle in President Nixon's eye as he scanned the crowd. . . . There's no 
words to describe it."

NIXON'S BIG DAY: 'IT'S ONE . . . WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The text of Richard M. Nixon's speech at the dedication of his library and 
birthplace: 
</P>
<P>
Thank you. Well, Mr. President (Bush), may I express my deep appreciation for 
that much too generous introduction. Over the past 44 years since I've been in 
public life, I have been introduced to literally thousands of audiences all 
over the world. This is the first time I've ever been introduced by the 
President of the United States. May I express my appreciation to my other 
colleagues, former Presidents, for their gracious comments, not only about me, 
but particularly about my wife, Pat. This is a very special day for us. 
</P>
<P>
And I think I speak for all of those in this great audience today in expressing 
appreciation not only to President Bush and Barbara Bush, but also to President 
Ford and President Reagan and their ladies, that they are here today. This is a 
very special occasion because there are four Presidents here. But what makes it 
even more special is that for the first time in the inauguration of a library, 
four First Ladies are here. 
</P>
<P>
I think all of my colleagues would agree that there is no more important a 
position or a career that a woman could have than to be a First Lady, the wife 
of the President of the United States. Or as First Lady Barbara Bush might put 
it, in the future, there could be no more important career for a man than to be 
a husband of the President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And I want to express appreciation to all of you who have made this facility 
possible, and to all of you who have come on this day to participate in this 
ceremony with us. It's been a great day for us, and it's one that we will 
always remember. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Pat and I have had the opportunity to visit some wonderful 
places. We've been to Versailles, we've been to Westminster, to the Kremlin, to 
the Great Wall of China, to Angkor Wat in Cambodia. I must say that many of 
them were memorable experiences, all of them were, in fact. But nothing we have 
ever seen matches this moment, to be welcomed home again so warmly on this day 
by our friends in California. 
</P>
<P>
I hope all of you will have an opportunity to take a tour of the library, and I 
hope that you will share some of the things that my colleagues, the former 
Presidents and President Bush, have referred to. What you will see, among other 
things, is a personal life: the influence of a strong family, of inspirational 
ministers, of great teachers. You will see a political life, running for 
Congress, running for the Senate, running for governor, running for President 
-- three times. Won some, lost some, all interesting. 
</P>
<P>
And you will see also, the life of a great nation, 77 years of it, a period in 
which we had unprecedented progress for the United States. And you will see 
great leaders, leaders who changed the world, who helped to make the world what 
we have today. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing those things will certainly be interesting, but let me remind you that 
when you go through this library, I hope you will remember that while the past 
is interesting, it is important only insofar as it points the way to a better 
future. And that is why we are here today, to talk about that better future. 
</P>
<P>
As I look back over life, I can think what has happened in the years since I 
was born in this little house, 71 years ago. I have many memories, some of them 
good, some of them not so good. But I do know that as far as that life is 
concerned, I am glad that I had the opportunity to come from here and go as far 
as I have. 
</P>
<P>
Let me say that as far as the past is concerned, though, remember, what is 
important is what it tells us about the future. My friend, Paul McCracken, from 
the University of Michigan, sent me a little poem that graphically makes that 
point. He said, "The lightning bug is brilliant, but it doesn't have a mind. It 
travels through creation with its headlight on behind." And so as far as we're 
concerned, let us learn from the past, but let us always keep our headlight on 
the road ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back over the years, when I think of what has happened in those 70 
years, those 77 years, I remember that 70 years ago in that little house, I 
used to lie in bed. I'd hear a train whistle in the middle of the night, and I 
would dream of places far away that I'd hoped to visit someday. I never dreamed 
that I would ever have the opportunity to visit over 80 countries during the 
period of my lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
And I must say that as far as those visits are concerned, they taught me 
something. You will hear sometimes, these days, that the United States is in 
decline, that we've seen our best days. You will hear that the United States no 
longer has the means or the will to play a great role in the world. Don't you 
believe it. I can tell you what I have found in my travels. In my travels to 
other countries, I have found some people who like us. I have found some people 
who envy us. I have found some people who hate us. But most of the people in 
the world know in their hearts that without the leadership of the United States 
of America, peace and freedom would not survive in the world. 
</P>
<P>
And it is our privilege to provide that leadership. And that is why I would 
trust that all of you here, and all of you listening on television and radio, 
would give President Bush your wholehearted support as he works for that kind 
of leadership for the United States of America. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a burden to be borne grimly, but it's a great challenge. Look at 
what the challenge is. I was born a year before World War I began, and in my 
lifetime, more people were killed in wars than in all the wars fought in the 
history of civilization before the 20th Century began. Our challenge today is 
looking ahead to deal with that problem. The 20th Century will be remembered as 
a century of war. Our challenge is to help make the 21st Century a century of 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
But peace is not our only goal. Our goal also is to remember why we are here, 
what America really means to the world. And so as we consider our challenges 
beyond peace, let history record that we just did not save the world from 
communism, but that we helped to make the world safe for freedom. That is the 
great challenge for Americans today. 
</P>
<P>
Let our goal be that all people in the world can enjoy what most Americans 
enjoy, the blessings of freedom, of justice, of progress. That was a dream that 
was impossible in times past, but because of recent developments, it is a dream 
that can now come true. And so with this challenge in mind, let us look also to 
where we have been, and where we are going. 
</P>
<P>
As I look back on those years, 77 in all, and I remember that in the period of 
that time, that I have seen many things happen in the world. And I know that as 
I stand here, that we are very fortunate as Americans, to have played a role in 
what has happened. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, after a White House state dinner, a splendid musical group from 
California entertained the audience. At the conclusion of the program, the 
chairman, or I should say, the leader of the group, asked to say a few words. 
He expressed appreciation for being invited to appear at the White House. And 
then he concluded by saying, "You know, it's a long way from Watts to the White 
House." He was right, but let me tell you, it's a long way from Yorba Linda to 
the White House too. 
</P>
<P>
I have made that journey, and I want to see a country in which every young 
American can have the opportunity to make that journey. It doesn't mean that 
all will make it. We all can't be President. We all can't be congressmen, or 
senators, or governors -- I found that out. But on the other hand, let us 
always make sure for the young Americans that the road ahead is never blocked 
by prejudice, or ignorance, or poverty. And that he or she can go as hard as 
his or her talents will take them. That is the goal we want for young Americans 
today. 
</P>
<P>
And because there are so many young people here today, may I add a word to you. 
I believe in the American Dream because I have seen it come true in my own 
life. And I want you to know that as far as you're concerned, I want your 
dreams to come true as well. You will suffer disappointments in life, and 
sometimes you will be very discouraged. It is sad to lose, but the greatest 
sadness is to travel through life without knowing either victory or defeat. 
Always remember that only when during your lifetime you are involved in a cause 
greater than yourself, can you be truly true to yourself. 
</P>
<P>
And so with those points in mind, may I leave also this final thought. Remember 
that there couldn't be a better time to be alive than now. There couldn't be a 
better country in which to be born and in which to live, than now, because you 
hold the future in your hands.

MISSPELLED BANNER STILL GAVE THE RIGHT MESSAGE

The city went all out for Richard M. Nixon library festivities Thursday, 
displaying banners and signs everywhere in town. But one banner was prepared by 
someone who could have been a dropout from the current First Lady's literacy 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome Noxin," the sign proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
It stayed up on the side of a building just long enough to be spotted by a few 
photographers. Then an embarrassed worker realized the error and whisked the 
banner away. 
</P>
<P>
On a day so carefully planned, so heavy with speeches and ceremony, so full of 
Presidents, current and former, there were bound to be occasions that weren't 
on the program. Here are just a few of them: 
</P>
<P>
While most of the dedication's events were on time, not everything ran like 
clockwork. When master of ceremonies and show biz veteran Johnny Grant told the 
audience to welcome Dr. and Mrs. Norman Vincent Peale to the stage, he turned 
around with a flourish only to find an empty stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told that when you're in trouble, you can always turn to the 
Marines," Grant said, "and that's what I'm doing." The Marine Corps Band from 
El Toro, in the best show business tradition, unhesitatingly filled the void by 
playing an unscheduled number. 
</P>
<P>
When the four Presidents were supposed to come to the platform, there was 
another delay. As more music was played to fill the gap, a New York Times 
reporter joked in the press gallery: "I bet I know what's causing the delay. I 
bet Jerry Ford is lost." 
</P>
<P>
Another reporter wondered aloud whether the delay would amount to "an 18 
1/2-minute gap," referring to the notorious erased portion of one of Nixon's 
Watergate tapes. 
</P>
<P>
It came close: 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists did more than quip, they also contributed to the long lines -- 
stretching as far as the eye could see -- that the public had to stand in 
before going through a metal detector outside the library grounds entrance. One 
of the networks, CBS, caused problems when staffers left their television 
truck, parked near the library, locked and unoccupied. That made the Secret 
Service nervous, fearing that the truck contained something more ominous than a 
transmitter. For nearly an hour, the line didn't move while security agents 
searched for the party with the key. 
</P>
<P>
Gene La Blond's RV got a thorough going-over when he parked it across the 
street from the library. La Blond, from La Habra, used the oversize vehicle to 
provide a bird's eye view of the ceremony to friends, who climbed to the roof 
and watched the festivities with binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
"The FBI came and went through it this morning with a fine-tooth comb but 
outside of that, we haven't had any trouble at all," La Blond said. "The only 
problem is you can't get more than eight up there at a time, otherwise the roof 
will fall." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon supporters came in all ages. Pattye Byrd, 15, a sophomore at Troy High 
School in Fullerton, who was among students gathered at a nearby church at 1 
a.m. to fill the 50,000 red, white and blue balloons that were released after 
the speeches, noted that she and her classmates were not born when Nixon 
resigned in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
But many are supporters of the former President. 
</P>
<P>
"Just 'cuz he got caught doesn't mean he's bad, " Pattye said. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was top-heavy with big-name Republicans but one politician was 
conspicuously absent -- U.S. Sen. and GOP gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson. 
Was he ducking the event after calculating that an appearance with Nixon would 
hurt his campaign? 
</P>
<P>
Not so, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
"He had tickets, he wanted to come out," campaign spokesman Bill Livingstone 
said. Sudden changes in the Senate schedule kept Wilson in Washington, 
Livingstone explained. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Senate had been expected to spend Thursday working on a major civil 
rights bill. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure unexpectedly passed late Wednesday night, and Thursday morning, 
the senators moved to the 1990 farm bill, a piece of legislation with 
potentially major impact on California agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice" to have been there, said Livingstone, "although, 
frankly, with four Presidents there, it would be a little hard to get into the 
limelight." 
</P>
<P>
Gayle Wilson subbed for her husband at the dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Good old American capitalism reigned outside the dedication ceremonies: 
T-shirts and buttons were hawked after the event; muffins, sweet rolls and 
parking spaces were on sale before. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Friga, 40, turned his gas station into a parking lot, offering spaces for 
$15 a pop. It was only fair, he said, considering all the business he would 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
The avid Nixon admirer was planning to attend a $250-a-plate dinner in the 
former President's honor at the Century Plaza Hotel on Thursday night. "I don't 
feel guilty," Friga said about charging hapless souls for parking. "Besides, 
how do you think I'm paying for the dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
Back at the dedication ceremony, George P. Shultz served as sort of an 
aide-de-camp to Henry A. Kissinger for a brief period before the Presidents' 
speeches. Shortly after the two men arrived and were seated in the VIP area, 
Shultz could be seen passing programs from others in the VIP section to 
Kissinger for autographs. Kissinger obliged everyone. Few seemed interested in 
Shultz's autograph. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the misspelled sign, another banner not only got Nixon's name 
right, it gave a warning to President Bush. The sign, posted across the street 
from the library, said: "Watch out, George. He's Tan, Rested and Ready. Nixon 
in 1992!" 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Bill Billiter, Tammy Drummond, Ted Johnson, David Lauter, Tony 
Marcano, Maria Newman and David Reyes contributed to this story.

Inside an air-conditioned trailer in the Richard M. Nixon Library and 
Birthplace parking lot Thursday morning, "NBC Nightly News" anchor Tom Brokaw 
was on the speaker phone to his senior producer in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're going to want to do more than that -- we've come all this way," 
he said, requesting more air time for the dedication story, which he planned to 
use as the lead story for his live broadcast from the library that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an enormous crowd here and it has really captured the fancy of 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
NBC News had predicted that the Nixon library dedication would be a major story 
-- big enough to warrant sending Brokaw out from New York to anchor the 
"Nightly News." Brokaw was astounded that the celebration would generate a 
crowd of 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This is much bigger than the Carter Library dedication," said Brokaw, tie-less 
and in shirt sleeves. "The enduring legacy of the Nixon organization is they're 
great advance people." 
</P>
<P>
As the "Nightly News" broadcast started to take shape at 9:35 a.m., the library 
dedication was vying with Pete Rose's five-month prison sentence as the top 
story of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Brokaw, who spent the night in a Beverly Hills hotel, had arrived at the 
library 15 minutes earlier with Linda Ellman, West Coast producer of the 
"Nightly News." Five NBC camera crews were already filming various aspects of 
the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
As managing editor of the news show, Brokaw would consult the news wire and 
keep in touch with his senior producer in New York throughout the day to 
determine which stories would be included in the half-hour program's 22 minutes 
of news. 
</P>
<P>
"The continuing dilemma of our business is we've got a fixed amount of time 
every night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:15, Brokaw walked through the maze of TV trucks and vans to the edge of 
the crowd watching the dedication ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on a camera case, he took occasional notes as each president spoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen thousands of these things and it's fun," he said. "I mean, I'm a 
tourist." 
</P>
<P>
Brokaw's presence at the edge of the crowd did not go unrecognized. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan Rather!" exclaimed a young man in a T-shirt standing a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Brokaw turned around and grinned. 
</P>
<P>
"Wrong one," he said. "I'm Brokaw." 
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, he signed numerous autographs and obliged several requests 
for pictures. When the young man in the T-shirt asked Brokaw to sign an 
autograph, he signed it from "Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw." 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the trailer after the ceremony, Brokaw wrote the copy for his 
introduction and worked on his library dedication story. 
</P>
<P>
At 1, Brokaw put on his tie, slipped on his coat and walked over to the 
library's reflecting pool where the technical crew had set up lights and 
cameras for his interview with Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
After shaking hands with Nixon, Brokaw introduced the former President to his 
mother, Jean, a resident of Leisure World in Laguna Hills, who had her picture 
taken with Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
On his way back to the trailer, Brokaw said he was "relatively pleased" with 
his interview. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon is "pretty practiced at what he wants to say," Brokaw said, "and it's 
hard to catch him off guard." 
</P>
<P>
In the hour and a half remaining until air time, Brokaw and Ellman discussed 
which portions of the interview would be included in the piece that would air. 
Brokaw continued to work on his script and reviewed the other stories in the 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
The trailer where Brokaw was working was relatively serene. Not so the 
tape-editing trailer, where Ellman and an editor were hurriedly editing the 
20-minute Nixon interview down to three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes before the 3:30 broadcast, which would air live in New York at 
6:30, Brokaw stepped out of his office and announced, "Well, boys and girls, 
it's almost time for me to go on television." 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the reflecting pool where he mounted a platform. A make-up man 
dabbed his face with powder and a technician ran three different cables up the 
back of his sport coat. 
</P>
<P>
In the remaining minutes, Brokaw ran a comb through his hair and practiced 
reading his opening. 
</P>
<P>
And then, with the white farmhouse where Nixon was born as his backdrop, Brokaw 
gazed into the camera and said in his carefully modulated delivery: 
</P>
<P>
"Headlines: A bad day for Pete Rose. He's sentenced to prison. A big day for 
Richard Nixon. He gets a library -- and lots of presidential attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Good evening from Yorba Linda, California. Pete Rose and Richard Nixon, love 
them or hate them, no two men have been more dominant in the national pastimes 
of baseball and politics. They share something else -- a long fall from grace. 
. . ."

NEARLY 500 PROTESTERS JEER GUESTS ARRIVING FOR NIXON BANQUET

<P>
While friends and admirers of Richard M. Nixon gathered to honor the former 
President on Thursday night, a boisterous crowd of nearly 500 demonstrators -- 
representing an eclectic mix of causes -- loudly protested the event, blocking 
traffic for a short time as they lay in the street. 
</P>
<P>
The protest was nonviolent but police arrested at least 14 demonstrators in 
front of the Century Plaza Hotel as the Nixon gala was beginning inside. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, many of them in costume, chanted "Stop GOP death squads," 
and yelled "Shame, shame," as limousines unloaded guests in front of the hotel. 
When tuxedoed party guests leaned off balconies to eye the commotion from 
above, demonstrators yelled for them to jump. 
</P>
<P>
The group appeared to represent about 30 different causes. Malathion spraying, 
anti-abortion legislation, American support for Latin American regimes and the 
federal government's efforts to combat AIDS all came under vocal attack. 
</P>
<P>
Katie Meyer, a spokeswoman for the hotel, looked on in amazement. "It looks 
like something out of 1969," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the angry rhetoric, riot-geared police and vehemently anti-Republican 
sentiments of the protesters summoned up images of Nixon's presidency, which 
only hours earlier had been glowingly lauded by Presidents Gerald R. Ford, 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush during the dedication ceremonies for the Richard 
M. Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
But the demonstrators at the Century Plaza found the dedication ceremonies 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically we find it outrageous that the Republican Party is spending so much 
energy to resurrect a man like Richard Nixon who many of us think is a criminal 
and should be in jail," said Catherine Suitor, from the Committee in Solidarity 
with the People of El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Stans, a former Nixon secretary of commerce who pleaded guilty to 
violating federal elections law while working for Nixon's 1972 reelection 
campaign, dismissed the protesters: "I say it's the democratic process, and 
what they're doing is unimportant. It's a sign of the times we live in." 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen helmeted police stood by as the protest began and did not 
interfere until demonstrators blocked access to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"It was peaceful, but it was also unlawful," said Fred Nixon, a spokesman for 
the Los Angeles Police Department. "They were blocking the street." 
</P>
<P>
The protest dwindled shortly after the arrests, and dissipated after the hotel 
began routing the guests through a second entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Once the melee outside ended, the 1,500 guests still had to grapple with one 
last inconvenience: The hotel's air conditioning failed for several hours 
before the party, and by the time guests arrived, it was nearly as hot inside 
as it had been during the dedication ceremonies earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Still, guests mingled in an atmosphere of reunion, many commenting on the sense 
of family that bound Nixon's followers and on the joy of the day's dedication. 
</P>
<P>
"The library allows for a cleansing of the Nixon record in a way that both 
Nixon and the public can understand and appreciate," said Gary Hunt, executive 
vice president of the Irvine Co., who was at the party representing company 
president Donald Bren. "It's going to allow Americans who see it to make up 
their own minds as to what place Nixon should have in history, because it shows 
the good and the bad." 
</P>
<P>
The black-tie event, sponsored by movie producer Jerry Weintraub and Los 
Angeles lawyer Gerald L. Parskey, featured remarks by the former President and 
several of his most prominent supporters, including former Ambassador Walter 
Annenberg and comedian Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Nixon family were also present, and as they walked onto the 
dais, Pat Nixon stopped to hug Delores Hope, Bob Hope's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other guests at Thursday night's party were Orange County Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley and his wife, Emma Jane; former Rep. Robert E. Badham and his 
wife, Anne; and George and Judie Argyros, who were also included in a special 
VIP reception with the Nixons before dinner. 
</P>
<P>
George Argyros is chairman of Arnel Development and is one of the chief 
sponsors of the Nixon library. 
</P>
<P>
As guests finished their cocktails, they crossed into the hotel's Los Angeles 
Ballroom, where tables for 10 were set with floor-length forest green linen 
cloths and towering silver candelabra. The main course was roast loin of veal 
with forest mushrooms and Maderia sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon entered to the tune of "California, Here We Come," and the Rev. Billy 
Graham delivered the invocation. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Jeffrey A. Perlman, Lanie Jones, Ann Conway and Dana Parsons, and 
correspondent Laura Michaelis contributed to this report.

POLICE HOPE PARENTS' ARREST SENDS MESSAGE;

<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a rash of child drownings in Orange County this year, police said 
that they hoped prosecution of the parents of an 18-month-old girl who was 
hospitalized after nearly drowning in a tub while left unattended would send a 
message to others. 
</P>
<P>
"There is obvious neglect if children do not know how to swim and take care of 
themselves" in water, La Habra Police Lt. Joseph Milazzo said. "If they are 
left alone, then it's a serious crime." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy DeArmond, 26, and his wife, Diana, 22, of La Habra were scheduled to be 
arraigned today in Municipal Court in Fullerton on charges that they acted 
criminally when they allowed their two young daughters to take a bath without 
adult supervision, Milazzo said. 
</P>
<P>
The injured daughter, Elizabeth, was in fair condition Thursday at Children's 
Hospital of Orange County, hospital spokeswoman Agnes Gibson said. She is not 
expected to suffer any long-term effects. 
</P>
<P>
"She is conscious," Gibson said, "and is improving." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth's parents found her Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. floating face-down in a 
bathtub, Milazzo said. She was taking a bath with her 2 1/2-year-old sister, 
Heather. 
</P>
<P>
After Elizabeth was admitted to the hospital, the parents were taken into 
custody and booked La Habra Jail, Milazzo said. They were transferred to Orange 
County Central Jail in Santa Ana overnight and initially held on $10,000 bail 
each, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The parents were released Thursday morning on their own recognizance, sheriff's 
officials said. They were unavailable for comment on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The parents "indicated to officers that they commonly leave their children 
unattended in the bathtub," Milazzo said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Shade said that the decision to press charges against 
the DeArmonds was not unusual. She said that the district attorney's office 
prosecutes dozens of child endangerment cases each year, including drownings, 
shootings and other accidental, life-threatening situations. 
</P>
<P>
Shade said that prosecutors normally base their cases on the severity of the 
incident or on evidence that there is a pattern of negligence or endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
"We always look at each on a case-by-case basis," Shade said. "If there is some 
evidence that the parents do something routinely, then it is something we could 
take into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
The parents, who live in a small, two-story apartment located in a low-income 
neighborhood of north La Habra, found Elizabeth after Heather started yelling 
for help from the bathtub, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The parents, who were home at the time, had left the girls alone for at least 
10 minutes, Milazzo said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Jimmy DeArmond loudly protested his arrest Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The father was extremely upset and indicated that the arrest was unlawful," 
Milazzo said. The mother, however, "went along quietly," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was the latest in a string of drownings and near drownings in the 
county. This year alone, at least seven children have drowned, most of them in 
swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
Milazzo said that he hoped the threat of prosecution would prompt parents to be 
more attentive to their children when they are around water.

IT'S NOT HAPPY TRAILS FOR BIKERS; 
</P>
<P>
ECOLOGY: MOUNTAIN BIKES HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM THE SENSITIVE UPPER NEWPORT BAY 
PRESERVE UNTIL SPECIFIC TRAILS CAN BE DESIGNATED FOR THEIR USE.

<TEXT>
<P>
On a recent Saturday, county Park Ranger Nancy Bruland pointed to the dusty 
bluffs rising above her in the Upper Newport Bay. Along with the established 
hiking path winding horizontally up the hill, there was a number of deep, bumpy 
ruts cutting their way down the ridge. 
</P>
<P>
The ruts were largely made by mountain bikers and have been additionally eroded 
by more bikers, hikers and the natural water runoff in the area. Since Bruland 
took the job as sole county caretaker of the 115-acre Upper Newport Bay 
regional park, which lies to the west of Jamboree Road and north of Back Bay 
Drive, she has seen between five and seven mountain bikers each day on the 
paths. Some of them, she said, are simply unconcerned about the damage that 
they can do to park hills and the animal environments. 
</P>
<P>
"Erosion is the biggest concern. When they blaze new trails, they wipe out the 
vegetation," Bruland explained, adding that since she went to work at the park 
late last year, several residents have told her how the number of bikers has 
increased steadily over the last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
So, until specific trails are designated for mountain bike riders by the 
county's General Park Development Plan, Bruland is prohibiting bicycles from 
the park, leaving them the asphalt paths at road level for their racing and 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
Bruland is not the first to accuse some Orange County cyclists of riding 
roughshod over the environment. Last fall, complaints from South Laguna 
residents prompted county officials to abandon plans to run a bike path through 
part of Aliso Canyon. And in Orange, bike riders were blamed for scaring horses 
being ridden down a bridle path along the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
Skip Lauderbaugh, a spokesman for the biking club, SHARE, expressed frustration 
at the Newport Bay limitations, though he said he sympathizes with Bruland's 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived down the street from the Back Bay for 30 years, and I've been 
hiking back there since I was 6 years old," Lauderbaugh said. "Instead of 
restricting access, they need to educate the people as to how sensitive an 
environment it is." 
</P>
<P>
Lauderbaugh maintains that people have been breaking new trails for as long as 
he has lived near the park and says that since people come from all over the 
county to the few parks that are open to mountain bikers, the trails that 
remain open will have to tolerate a greater number of users. 
</P>
<P>
But he and other members of SHARE agree that there has to be a greater 
awareness of the environment among mountain bikers. The group has produced an 
educational pamphlet instructing riders on biking etiquette, on the safe ways 
to bike and the need to stay on the trail. Their group takes the stance that 
all trail users in the park need to cooperate to keep the park safe for animals 
and plants that live there. 
</P>
<P>
Bruland is not just concerned about erosion and crushed vegetation but also 
</P>
<P>
possible damage to the habitats of the burrowing owl and the light-footed 
clapper rail. The clapper rail, a relatively uncommon bird, makes its nest in 
the short brush of the west-bluff side of the park. Upper Newport Bay is the 
home to about 70% of the birds. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of kids on BMX bikes, and they're cutting new trails and causing 
erosion, and there's no doubt about it," said SHARE member Marcko Popovich, 
but, he added, conscientious riders do not break new paths, speed or hog the 
trails. In fact, Lauderbaugh added, "we're more critical of people riding that 
way than others . . . and 90% of the riders are really safe people." 
</P>
<P>
Lauderbaugh and Bruland agree that there has to be a recognized policy for 
bikers and other trail users in the Upper Bay, where for years hikers, 
horseback riders and cyclists have shared the road and paths. They, along with 
other residents of the area and naturalists, are working to plan a safe course 
for the park through the county's General Development Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the plan also needs to spell out enforcement of trail restrictions, 
Bruland added. Despite vigilant patrols, and help from Fish and Game rangers 
and local residents, some bike riders ignore the signs posted at entrances to 
the facility. And once they are caught, Bruland doesn't have the authority to 
issue citations -- though she can have the riders removed from the park by 
police. In most cases, she said, she tries to explain to the riders the harm 
that they can do to the park. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how you approach them. . . . Sometimes they'll listen and pay 
attention and sometimes they tell you to, frankly, mind your own business," she 
said. "I have found that it's a real me-type of generation around here." 
</P>
<P>
Though the blame does not entirely fall on the shoulders of mountain bikers, 
Bruland feels that until a policy can be worked out that balances the need of 
the bikers with the protection of the resources, no bikes should be allowed on 
the dirt paths inside the park. Popovich agrees, though he hopes that with 
speed limits and additional education for cyclists using the park, sufficient 
trails can be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
And SHARE also sponsors a program that helps revegetate land that has been 
eroded by human activities by planting native plants and by shoring up eroding 
bluffs. Members of the group have spoken with Bruland and are making plans for 
future projects in the Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors is tentatively scheduled to approve the 
temporary ban, along with a number of other interim park provisions, during its 
Aug. 7 meeting. The General Development Plan for the park is due out within the 
next two years, county officials said.

POLICE HAVE SCUFFLE WITH DRUG SUSPECT

<P>
Undercover narcotics officers wrestled a loaded handgun away from a suspect 
they arrested on suspicion of trying to sell them three grams of heroin, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
No shots were fired during the officers' scuffle with Hector R. Morales, 25, of 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Wednesday about 3 p.m. at the corner of Edinger and Grand 
avenues in Santa Ana when Morales and another man, Ciro B. Milan, 26, of Santa 
Ana, sold the heroin to the undercover officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After the sale, officers closed in on Morales' car "to make the arrest (but) 
Morales tried to escape, backing into the approaching unmarked (police) car," 
according to Orange Police Lt. Ed Tunstall. Milan was in the passenger seat, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When officers ran to Morales' car on foot, they saw him reach under the car 
seat and pull out a gun, Tunstall said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers wrestled the loaded gun away, and both suspects suffered minor 
scrapes, Tunstall said. 
</P>
<P>
Morales and Milan were arrested on suspicion of selling heroin and taken to 
Orange County Jail, where they are being held on $10,000 bail each. MATT LAIT

The incident occurred at a Lucky Food Center at 12451 Seal Beach Blvd. when a 
man "approached the cashier, who was counting the money in the cash drawer, and 
demanded all the money as he displayed a handgun under his shirt in his 
waistband," said Seal Beach Police Sgt. Ross Smith.

UNREGISTERED VOTER RESIGNS COUNCIL POST

Charles Babler, whose recent appointment to the City Council was jeopardized 
when it was discovered he is not a registered voter, resigned Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the City Council was to "reconfirm" Babler's appointment as its 
newest member, a handwritten note from Babler was read, in which he said: "I do 
hereby resign my council position effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
I find this necessary do to health reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Although Babler had been confirmed last month, it was later discovered that he 
was not registered to vote. Babler then registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Government guidelines are unclear whether a person may become a council member 
without being a registered voter. City Atty. Thomas W. Allen said the 
reconfirmation would eliminate any question of the appointment's validity. 
</P>
<P>
Because Babler's resignation was a surprise, the council must wait until the 
next meeting, on Aug. 14, to decide whether to fill the position again by 
appointment or leave it vacant until the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Babler, 54, was unanimously approved as the fifth council member on June 26, 
replacing Paul G. Verellen, who resigned earlier in the month. City officials 
said then that filling the position would help prevent deadlocks. JON NALICK

DEVELOPER LIABLE FOR GIRL'S INJURY

<P>
A Superior Court jury Thursday found the William Lyon Co. liable for a 1988 
accident that left a 10-year-old girl brain-damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also ruled that the development company had defrauded her parents, 
John and Patti Bretza, by intentionally overstating the size of their new 
Trabuco Canyon property, where the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
After four days of deliberation in Westminster, the jury found that the company 
should pay the family $55,000 for breaching the home's implied warranty and 
misleading the Bretzas about the property's boundary. The company told the 
family that their property extended to a temporary chain link fence. But when a 
permanent fence was erected on the true property line, it was closer to the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also held the William Lyon Co. solely responsible for their daughter's 
accident. Irvine-based Leaverton Brothers Inc., which installed the plumbing in 
the home and also was named in the suit, was found blameless. 
</P>
<P>
The Bretzas alleged that leaky plumbing in an upstairs bathroom caused a chunk 
of ceiling to fall on their daughter, Kristy, now 13. The Bretzas allege that 
Kristy has suffered seizures, headaches, nightmares and visual and intellectual 
impairment since the accident. On Aug. 20, the next phase of the trial will 
begin. The jury must then determine damages. The family in this phase is 
seeking to recover $600,000 spent on medical help since the accident plus 
future medical costs and the earnings she would have made had she not been 
injured, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both the Bretzas and William Lyon Co. declined comment Thursday 
because the damages phase is pending. 
</P>
<P>
However, Patti Bretza hailed the jury's decision, saying that "the good guys 
won." 
</P>
<P>
"The fraud verdict was the best. They're so big and they think that if they 
hurt the little people, they won't fight back," Patti Bretza said. JON NALICK

It's the little things that remind Karen Bagby how far she has come in a year's 
time and how close she came to losing everything she cares about. 
</P>
<P>
She thinks about it when she watches her son and daughter asleep with the easy 
slumber of children who are well cared for. Or when her 3-month-old baby boy, 
Auston, cries and she's there to comfort him. 
</P>
<P>
Bagby, 27-year-old mother of three and recovering crack cocaine addict, was 
given trial custody of her children in December. A few weeks ago she was 
awarded permanent custody. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's permanent -- that it's all over with when they're sleeping at 
night or I just sit watching them playing," Bagby said. "He (Auston) gets his 
bath at a certain time every night and his bottle and he's gone. There's just 
that feeling that this is permanent." 
</P>
<P>
Bagby, who once spent her nights at a crack house, lost her two older children 
-- Michelle, now 7, and James, now 5 -- about two years ago when authorities in 
Los Angeles County ruled her neglectful and unfit as a mother. She moved to 
Orange County about six months later and shortly thereafter entered the 
county's drug treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County court's earlier decision to take away her children was 
reversed on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
"They terminated my case and wished me luck," Bagby said, recalling the moment 
in court when the judge ruled her a fit mother. "It means I'm not in the system 
anymore. It's like a happy ending, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
For Orange County health officials, who last year spent $454,340 on a drug 
rehabilitation program for mothers addicted to drugs, Bagby is a success story 
to be heralded. It is a program in which officials acknowledge the relapse rate 
is more than 50%. So far, Bagby is hanging on. 
</P>
<P>
She admits to slipping once her first month in the program, more than a year 
ago, but subsequently passed all her mandatory weekly drug tests while still 
under the court's supervision. She regularly attends Narcotics Anonymous 
meetings because, she acknowledged, she will always be an addict. 
</P>
<P>
In April Bagby gave birth to a healthy, drug-free baby boy. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very active baby inside me. He moved around a lot," Bagby said, 
laughing. Then, she added proudly, "He's starting to get where he's getting a 
grip on his bottle. He'll probably be holding it by next month." 
</P>
<P>
Bagby said she is now hoping her younger sister, who moved in with her a few 
months ago, will be able to "get it together." Her sister, she said, has lost 
custody of all five of her children, including the baby girl she gave birth to 
while high on crack. 
</P>
<P>
As children, the two sisters provided each other their only nurturing in an 
otherwise loveless household -- a home where they were left to fend for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
As adults they have often followed the same path: They married brothers, lived 
in side-by-side homes -- and became addicts. Karen Bagby said she offers 
encouragement to her sister but can do little else. 
</P>
<P>
"She's in the process of getting her children back -- she's been clean for six 
months," Bagby said. "If you're going to get clean, you're going to get clean 
yourself. All anyone can do is give you support." 
</P>

U.S. SUES TO BLOCK MERGER OF 2 COUNTY AMPHITHEATERS; 
</P>
<P>
ANTITRUST ACTION: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS COMBINATION MIGHT RESULT IN HIGHER 
PRICES FOR CONCERT-GOERS AND LOWER PAY FOR PERFORMERS. A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING 
ORDER IS SOUGHT.

<P>
The U.S. Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit Thursday to block the 
planned merger of Orange County's two biggest concert venues, the Pacific 
Amphitheatre and Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, contending that the move would 
create an illegal monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court, Justice Department officials said 
the two huge amphitheaters dominate the concert-venue market in Orange County. 
Combining the two would leave few other suitable alternatives for promoters, 
performers and concert-goers in the event that the merger resulted in higher 
prices for booking or tickets, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect of the combination may be substantially to lessen competition, or 
to tend to create a monopoly, in the Orange County concert amphitheater market 
in violation of (the Clayton antitrust act)," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal under attack would combine the assets and operations of the two 
venues under a single limited partnership. The current Pacific Amphitheatre 
partners would own a 50% interest in the new entity and would operate both 
facilities, the lawsuit said. The current Irvine Meadows partners would hold a 
25% interest, and Ogden Corp., a national concessionaire, would own the 
remaining 25% interest in exchange for $8 million, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
The parties planned to consummate the merger at one minute past midnight today, 
the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department sought a temporary restraining order halting the merger, 
but the judge assigned to the case was not available to hear it Thursday. It 
was not immediately known if another hearing date was set. 
</P>
<P>
Justice officials said the merger would eliminate or lessen "actual and 
potential" competition between concert venues in Orange County. As a result, 
artists could be paid less for performing at the two facilities and 
concert-goers could have to pay higher prices and have fewer concerts to choose 
from, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, with 18,000 seats, and the 15,000-seat 
Irvine Meadows, eight miles away in Irvine, together bring in between $16 
million and $19 million in concert revenues annually, the suit said. Each 
hosted about half of the major concerts by performing artists in Orange County 
in the last three years, officials said. Combining the two would double the 
market share of the resulting partnership in a market that is already "highly 
concentrated," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the attorneys on the case could be reached for comment. Officials of 
New York-based Nederlander Organization, which owns a 50% interest in the 
Pacific Amphitheatre, were also unavailable. But they have said in the past 
that joint operation of the two venues would stimulate competition because 
booking agencies would have equal access to both. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Geddes, the managing partner of Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre who has 
teamed with former MCA chairman Irving Azoff to try to buy that facility for a 
sum that Geddes will not disclose, endorsed the Justice Department's action. 
</P>
<P>
"We view it as the appropriate thing for Justice to do," Geddes said. "To the 
extent that it doesn't affect what we're trying to accomplish, we'll go forward 
with our negotiations and hope to close them as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Geddes said he and Azoff are talking with Irvine partners Donald Koll, Paul 
Hegness and Charles Hoffman about their buyout offer. Geddes said he thinks 
that their negotiations are "making progress." And although the specter of a 
defense against the Justice Department is "ominous," Geddes said, he and Azoff 
have not received any indication that the suit might prompt quicker acceptance 
of their offer as a way of solving the Justice Department's concern over 
creation of a monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
Other Irvine partners could not be reached to discuss the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, meanwhile, the trial continued in an unrelated lawsuit filed by 
the Pacific Amphitheatre's neighbors over noise complaints. In testimony 
Thursday, the amphitheater's financial controller said the concert venue has 
never turned a profit since it opened in 1983.

TRUST FUND CREATED FOR BOY SHOT BY 5-YEAR-OLD

<P>
A trust fund was established Thursday to help pay the medical bills of a boy 
who was shot and injured by a 5-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Devine, manager of the apartment building where the shooting occurred, 
said she set up the fund to help the uninsured parents of 10-year-old Oscar 
Flores, who was listed in good condition Thursday at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"They need help . . . " Devine said. "Their son was a victim." 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Flores and a second boy were injured Wednesday when the 5-year-old fired 
a single bullet from a .38-caliber revolver. The bullet traveled through his 
brother's chest and into Oscar's. The boys had been playing unattended at the 
home of the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of the second injured boy requested that the hospital not release 
their child's condition. But Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry said both boys are 
expected to live. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said the boys apparently found the gun unloaded in a metal box inside a 
closet. "We have reason to believe that one of the older boys loaded the gun." 
Police are still investigating the shooting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The gun is registered to the brothers' mother, Katherine McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
Devine said she set up the fund at a First Interstate Bank branch at 222 S. 
Harbor Blvd. in Anaheim. Anyone interested in donating can call her at (714) 
776-6300. 
</P>
<P>
Devine said office workers at the apartment complex have raised $65 for the 
trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Flores' parents, Margarita and Hector Flores, could not be reached for 
comment, but Devine said they were very grateful that a fund was being 
established. "This whole thing has been very hard on them," she said.

COYOTES TRAVELING FARTHER FROM HABITAT TO FIND FOOD

Linda Nicholson's cat was used to having the run of the neighborhood. The big 
tomcat feared little and was well respected by other cats in the neighborhood. 
But last month, after 15 years of eluding dogs and cars, the cat fell victim to 
a foe Nicholson never thought to worry about -- coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
As a resident of Brea's Old Town section, well to the south of the hills and 
canyons that rim the city's northern border, Nicholson figured she would never 
see a coyote slinking down her street. But on June 8, she witnessed two of them 
in her front yard. 
</P>
<P>
About 2:30 a.m. Nicholson went out on her front porch to see what her dog was 
barking at. The two animals, about the size of German shepherds, took off when 
she appeared, Nicholson said, but not before one of them dropped what was left 
of her cat. 
</P>
<P>
"They were beige and brown, definitely coyotes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Coyotes have also been blamed by Lora Bramberg for the death of her cat earlier 
this month. Bramberg found her cat's remains, including its collar, at a nearby 
Alpha Beta. 
</P>
<P>
What frightens both Nicholson and Bramberg, who live off Brea Boulevard just 
south of Imperial Highway, is that the coyotes have traveled far from their 
normal habitat in the canyons, and have been bold enough to come right up to 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
Bramberg said her cat "never left my front porch. In fact I think there is 
blood on my porch." 
</P>
<P>
Coyotes are no strangers in many parts of Orange County with hilly terrain and 
open space. But after four years of drought, the animal's natural habitat has 
become depleted of the small animals and birds that coyotes normally feed upon, 
authorities say, and the coyotes have been spotted farther and farther from 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the hilly areas of north Tustin have had frequent encounters with 
coyotes for years, and now the animals have been spotted farther to the south 
in more populated neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"As the food chain dies out, coyotes will be seen in areas where there are 
people," said Patrick Moore, an information officer with the Department of Fish 
and Game. "They are scavengers and will eat lots of things, including fruit and 
vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, coyotes are not threats to humans, Moore said, but he has 
heard of instances where coyotes attacked small children. 
</P>
<P>
"Coyotes aren't prone to becoming aggressive unless they are trapped or 
cornered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman in Brea's maintainance department, there is little the 
city can do about the coyotes. Callers who complain about the animals are told 
to keep garbage cans covered and to keep pets and their food in the house at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Moore echoed that advice, saying that uncovered garbage was a great attraction 
to coyotes. He also suggested harvesting ripe fruits and vegetables 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
But even if residents are diligent in keeping their trash covered and their 
pets and pet food inside, once a coyote has found food, it will continue to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when you remove the stimulant, they will continue to travel to an area 
where they have had success," Moore said. "They form a pattern and it can take 
a while for that pattern to break."

GOODWILL II: WILL IT BE THE LAST? 
</P>

<P>
In 1986, the first Goodwill Games in the Soviet Union had one star. R.E. (Ted) 
Turner was creator, bankroller, broadcaster, promoter and philosopher. 
</P>
<P>
"Those aren't Communist dogs," he said one day while watching two strays cross 
a Moscow boulevard and making a point about equality among men. "Those are just 
dogs." 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing that Turner did not do was name the Games after himself, 
proving that, although his ego might be one of the world's largest, it rates no 
better than a silver medal against that of Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, the sequel, Goodwill Games II, opens today with so impressive 
a supporting cast that Turner no longer has to be the circus, just the 
ringmaster. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 2,500 athletes from 52 countries entered over the next 17 days 
in 21 sports, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. and its partners -- the Seattle 
Organizing Committee and the Soviet Union's Sports Committee -- have organized 
an event that, when compared to other international competitions, is surpassed 
in athletic excellence only by the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
As made-for-TV competition, these Games might even be more viewer-friendly than 
the Olympics because of their format. 
</P>
<P>
The organizers seeded at least one U.S. athlete and one Soviet athlete into 
each event and then filled the field by invitation with the six best athletes 
or teams available. 
</P>
<P>
In team events, medalists will be determined in tournaments. In individual 
events, all competitors advance to the finals, eliminating the possibility of a 
Carl Lewis fouling out of the long jump in the semifinals or a Matt Biondi 
cramping up in the first heat of the 100-meter butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi, who won seven swimming medals at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, is the 
featured performer today, when he attempts to reclaim the 50-meter freestyle 
record from Tom Jager at the King County Aquatics Center in Federal Way. They 
might be chasing East Germany's Nils Rudolph, who recently beat them both in 
Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Among other duels to watch over the next 17 days are Lewis against Leroy 
Burrell, also of the United States, in the 100 meters; Lewis against Robert 
Emmiyan of the Soviet Union in the long jump; swimmer Janet Evans against 
Astrid Strauss of East Germany and Julie McDonald of Australia in the 800-meter 
freestyle; Kurt Browning of Canada against Victor Petrenko of the Soviet Union 
and Christopher Bowman of the United States in men's figure skating; the United 
States against the Soviet Union in men's basketball, and the United States 
against Cuba and Japan in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet gymnasts, pairs skaters, ice dancers and ice hockey players; the 
Chinese divers; the Cuban boxers, and U.S. heptathlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee 
figure to be in classes by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
There have been some defections in recent days, particularly in track and 
field: 
</P>
<P>
 -- British miler Steve Cram, East German shotputter Ulf Timmermann and U.S. 
quarter-milers Butch Reynolds and Steve Lewis sent their regrets for one reason 
or another. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soviet officials will provide an update on pole vaulter Sergei Bubka's 
injured back when they find him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chinese women's basketball team withdrew Wednesday because of its poor 
performance this month in the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rex Lardner Jr., senior vice president and general manager of the 
Goodwill Games for TBS, said Thursday that 90% of the world's best athletes 
will compete in Seattle, Tacoma, Spokane and three other Washington cities. 
</P>
<P>
The TBS broadcast booth, however, will serve as the stage for some of the 
best-known athletes, including Dwight Stones, Rick Barry, Debi Thomas, Frank 
Shorter, Tracy Caulkins, John Naber, Karch Kiraly, Edwin Moses, Olga Korbut and 
Nadia Comaneci. The TBS super-station will televise 86 hours of the Games in 
the United States and reach 71 other countries with portions of its coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Another former athlete, President George Bush, had other commitments, but he 
sent his wife, Barbara, to speak Thursday to the Games' 10,000 volunteers, and 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, to represent him in Saturday's opening ceremony at Husky 
Stadium. Also scheduled to appear at the opening ceremony is former President 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
For those who are not interested in sports, the Goodwill Arts Festival includes 
performances by Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet, Montreal's Cirque de Soleil and 
Japan's Grand Kabuki Theatre. Turner, 51, did his part by bringing frequent 
companion Jane Fonda to a news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If Turner has maintained a lower profile in the organization of the Games than 
he did four years ago, one reason is that he has been busy creating a cartoon 
show that will have its premiere in September and is titled, "Captain Planet

</P>
<P>
Turner, who is not too modest to compare his commitment to improving the world 
to that of Albert Einstein and Madame Curie, must have seen himself leading a 
similar crusade in 1985, when he formed the Better World Society. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, perplexed by U.S. and Soviet Summer Olympic boycotts in 1980 
and 1984, he arrived upon the idea of the Goodwill Games to bring together 
athletes from the two superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
With only 11 months to prepare for the inaugural Games in the summer of 1986, 
the competition in Moscow and the Estonian seaport of Talinn were, generally, 
not of the same caliber of that of this summer. 
</P>
<P>
There were, however, some exceptional performances. Joyner-Kersee set her first 
world record in the heptathlon, becoming the first person to exceed 7,000 
points. Ben Johnson ran 9.95 seconds to win the 100 meters, an event in which 
Lewis finished third. Another athlete who later would be disgraced because of a 
positive drug test, Angel Myers, won four gold medals and a bronze in swimming. 
Evans emerged on the international scene with two bronzes. A Cheryl Miller-led 
U.S. women's basketball team handed the Soviet Union its first loss against 
international competition in 152 games. 
</P>
<P>
But hardly anyone in the United States was paying attention. Turner suffered a 
ratings disaster that cost him an announced $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
He has promised his advertisers significantly better ratings this time, but 
network executive privately admit that the numbers will be only slightly 
better. If interest in Seattle is an indicator, they are probably right. 
Despite a massive public relations campaign, only a little more than half of a 
1.1 million tickets available have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said Thursday that his losses will be more than the $13 million that has 
been projected but less than the $65 million that ABC lost on its 1988 Winter 
Olympics coverage in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, he also expressed less than 100% optimism about the future 
of the Games, which are scheduled in 1994 for Moscow and Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, the losses we will have will be hopeful enough to 
keep going," he said. "We've got plans to go on, and we probably will." 
</P>
<P>
If this is the final Goodwill Games, that will not disappoint the International 
Olympic Committee. The U.S. Olympic Committee has made peace with Turner, but 
the IOC would rather the Goodwill Games not clutter the calendar in 1994, when 
Lillehammer, Norway, will stage the Winter Olympics. "Now that there is no more 
Cold War, there is no reason for the Goodwill Games," IOC President Juan 
Antonio Samaranch said earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Turner acknowledged that the Cold War has thawed, but he said there is still a 
place for the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same as with your wife or your girlfriend or your children," he said. 
"The relationship might be good now, but you still have to work at it to 
maintain that relationship."

LANGSTON DOESN'T BLAME TEAMMATES FOR HIS 4-11 MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels' paltry offensive efforts in his support are unfortunate, Mark 
Langston says, but he doesn't believe they are the product of resentment toward 
him as a newcomer or his $16 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who was a free agent when he signed a five-year deal with the Angels 
last winter, has lost his last six decisions, is 1-8 with three no-decisions 
since a victory May 15 at Milwaukee and is 4-11 overall. During his 19 starts 
this season, opponents have outscored the Angels, 57-45, while he was in the 
game. His next start is Sunday against Cleveland at Anaheim Stadium, where he 
is 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," he said when asked if jealousy might play a part, however 
subconscious, in his teammates' stingy production. "I've never felt that. There 
have just been some tough losses. If there is, they keep it to themselves. I 
haven't seen it. Maybe it's something you (reporters) think about, but I don't. 
They realize I'm a human being and I'm out there competing like everyone else. 
I'm the first to admit I wish things were a lot different than what they are, 
but you win as a team and you lose as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Langston said his Christian faith helps him endure. "I pray to the Lord and put 
a lot of it on Him," the 29-year-old left-hander said. "I go out with the 
ability He gave me and do my best to pitch as capably as I can. The results 
haven't been there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Every game I'm going out expecting to win. I feel every time I go out there I 
have a very good opportunity to win and I look forward to every one of my 
starts. I've never been one to put that much pressure on myself. I'm a poor 
loser and I don't like to lose. I'll never be satisfied with losing. That's 
what's been frustrating through this whole ordeal. Even though I pitch decent, 
I've made mistakes and they've turned out to be big mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' offense hasn't given him -- or Jim Abbott -- much room for error, 
but he refused to condemn his teammates. "This is a team-oriented situation. 
You can't blame one person," Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't feel compelled to satisfy observers who expect him to put up big 
numbers because of the numbers on his paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true, my contract is large," he said, "but what they pay me for is to 
give the best I can give. That doesn't guarantee anything, which is sad. I give 
everything I've got every start I have, and the way I look at it, that's what 
I'm paid for." 
</P>
<P>
After his last start, a 3-1 loss to Milwaukee on Monday, Angel Manager Doug 
Rader said Langston was pitching well enough to be on the verge of 10 
consecutive victories. Langston smiled at the thought, but he isn't thinking in 
such grandiose terms. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be very nice, but I've got to win one before I can win 10," he 
said. "I have to look at it one game at a time."

BUDROE NEARLY WIPES OUT BEFORE CATCHING FIRST WAVE; 
</P>
<P>
SURFING: DESPITE HIS RANKING, HUNTINGTON BEACH RESIDENT'S PLANNING LAPSE FORCES 
HIM INTO QUALIFYING TRIALS AT SAN CLEMENTE MEET. 
</P>

SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes, it pays to be a little disorganized. Planning ahead isn't always the 
best course. Just ask Noah Budroe. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach surfer returned from an East Coast promotional tour with a 
sponsor on the day of the entry deadline for the Body Glove San Clemente Surf 
meet. He called contest officials, who basically said, "Sorry, tough luck. Want 
to put your name on the end of the 30-signature alternate list?" 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday morning, the first day of competition at the San Clemente Pier during 
this sixth stop on the Professional Surfing Assn. of America tour, Budroe 
learned he would be surfing this week, after all. And surfing a lot. All the 
way through the qualifying trials, which is an odd route for a guy who is No. 7 
in the PSAA rankings and No. 39 on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals world 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
But Budroe has discovered it's not a situation without advantages. He came into 
the meet with $5,525 in PSAA earnings this season and already has picked up 
another $150 in pocket money thanks to the $75 award to the winner of each 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I got in some good practice and made a little money on the way," said Budroe, 
who normally would not have competed until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, Budroe advanced to today's fifth round after a second-place 
finish in a Round 4 heat, which figured to be the most competitive of the day. 
The drama was gone before it began, however, and then what had been a fairly 
consistent two-to-three-foot southwest swell disappeared for much of the 
20-minute heat. 
</P>
<P>
Two surfers from each four-man heat advance and everyone knew who they would be 
before the horn sounded. Noel Rahme, of Huntington Beach, apparently missed his 
flight from the East Coast and amateur Ryan Ragan, of San Francisco, was left 
pining for his frigid home waters after a stingray, enjoying the 74-degree 
water off San Clemente, left his mark on Ragan's right leg and foot when he was 
"free-surfing" to warm up. 
</P>
<P>
So, with nothing to lose, Budroe's battle with 18-year-old sensation Kelly 
Slater was more show time than showdown. 
</P>
<P>
When a set finally arrived, Budroe caught a shoulder-high wave near the pier 
and pulled off four slashing backside cutbacks. But Slater grabbed the next 
wave and countered by going airborne over a breaking section and landing under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Slater, from Cocoa Beach, Fla., edged Budroe by a half-point on three of the 
five judges' cards. 
</P>
<P>
Budroe, who has finished No. 5 in the PSAA rankings the past two years, already 
has made two finals this season, finishing third and fourth. He learned to ride 
waves in Hawaii after his parents moved to Sunset Beach, home of the famed 
North Shore break, on the island of Oahu when he was 1. 
</P>
<P>
Budroe moved to Huntington Beach five years ago, however, forsaking good waves 
for good business. He wanted to be closer to his clothing-manufacturer sponsor 
and compete in the California-based PSAA tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Hawaii has the best waves in the world, no doubt, but you're so far out of 
touch there," he said. "Everything's happening on the Mainland. This is where 
all the money is. It's really a struggle to get a sponsor in Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
Budroe also discovered he liked the level of competition and the size of the 
paychecks on the PSAA tour. He won the first PSAA contest he entered, an event 
in Malibu in 1985, and that was enough to send him home to pack. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never finished higher than 17 in an ASP meet, never been able to crack 
into those top seeds (on the world tour)," he said. "They have other pro 
contests in Hawaii, but there's so many good surfers over there and they give 
like $500 to the winner." 
</P>
<P>
There's a check for $5,500 awaiting Sunday's winner here. And Budroe doesn't 
mind paddling out a few extra times with that kind of money at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Surfing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa's Mike Cruickshank, the PSAA points champion in 1986, competed in a 
wet-suit hood Thursday. He was trying to protect a recently ruptured eardrum. 
The hood apparently worked well enough to allow Cruickshank to win his heat to 
advance to the fifth round. Other Orange County surfers who advanced to today's 
competition include Kirk Tice, Joey Zintel, Jeff Deffenbaugh and amateur Mark 
Austin of Huntington Beach; Jim Pinkerton, Mark Lindblad and Matt Archbold of 
San Clemente; amateurs Kasey Curtis and Shane Stoneman of San Juan Capistrano; 
Chris Billy of Dana Point; Brian McNulty of Capistrano Beach; David Giddings of 
Corona del Mar, and Glen Tilly of Laguna Hills.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: CAM DATA AND SULCUS SUSPEND MERGER TALKS

<P>
Merger talks have been suspended between Sulcus Computer of Greensburg, Pa., 
and Cam Data Systems, a Fountain Valley maker of computers and point-of-sale 
systems for the retail industry. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies announced in June that Sulcus planned to acquire Cam Data in 
a $2-million stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Ratner, chairman and chief executive of Sulcus, said his company remains 
interested in buying Cam Data but the companies could not reach a final 
agreement last week as originally expected. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Smith, Cam Data's president and chief executive, said the two companies 
agreed that the timing for a merger was wrong and that talks should be 
suspended. He said there would be no impact on the company's operations. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months ended March 31, Cam Data Systems reported a loss of $636,000 
on revenue of $2.2 million, compared to a loss of $266,000 on revenue of $2.2 
million a year earlier.

BRIEFCASE / INTERNATIONAL TRADE: REPORT AIMED AT PC FIRMS PURSUING PIECE OF

For computer companies muddling through the stacks of business and joint 
venture proposals from Eastern European companies, picking a suitable market 
and reliable business partner can be a headache. A new quarterly publication is 
hoping to point the way for computer makers to reach the right markets. 
</P>
<P>
Microcomputer Marketing, a quarterly report published by Microcomputer 
Consultants Inc. of Irvine, says that besides the Soviet Union and East 
Germany, only three East Bloc countries have the potential for developing trade 
ties with the U.S. personal computer industry: Poland, Czechoslovakia and 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
It will be easier for PC makers to enter the three markets as a supplier to 
local assembly plants, the report advised, because the governments impose high 
tariffs on assembled computers. More important, certain restrictions imposed by 
the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls still apply until 
the countries put in place export control mechanisms suggested by the 
Paris-based group, which administers export controls for Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
Most personal computers sold in these Eastern European countries are 
IBM-compatible machines manufactured in the Far East and often assembled by 
Polish, Hungarian and Czech PC suppliers.

TOP FUNDAMERICA EXECUTIVE FACES FRAUD CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: OFFICIAL OF IRVINE-BASED MARKETING FIRM IS ARRESTED IN 
CONNECTION WITH A FLORIDA STATE PROBE OF AN ALLEGED PYRAMID SCAM.

The top executive of the Irvine-based marketing firm FundAmerica Inc. was 
arrested Thursday in Delaware on fraud charges in connection with a Florida 
state investigation into whether the company ran an illegal pyramid scam, 
Florida state regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert T. Edwards, president of FundAmerica, was arrested in Wilmington. He is 
being held on charges of criminal organized fraud and unlawful lottery 
activity, said Joe Bizzarro, spokesman for the Florida attorney general's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica, a network marketing firm, confirmed in a statement Thursday night 
that its offices in Irvine were searched in connection with an investigation by 
the Florida attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida attorney general also issued a "cease and desist order" against the 
company in connection with the investigation and accused the company of running 
a scam that bilked state residents of more than $8 million. FundAmerica has 21 
days to respond to the order. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica's statement said the company was "shocked by the actions of the 
Florida statewide prosecutor's office." 
</P>
<P>
Clifton H. Jolley, a FundAmerica spokesman, said the company has been operating 
for four years and that the Florida regulators did not attempt to contact the 
company before issuing the cease and desist order. The company also said that 
regulators did not understand the difference between a legal network marketing 
company and an illegal pyramid scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to search our offices, for heaven's sake, search it for 
something we haven't already given you," Jolley said. "We have fully 
cooperated. This may have been done for dramatic reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Jolley said the company was still operating, but he said the Florida state 
actions would have a "chilling effect" on its sales organization. Authorities 
in Texas, Florida and California are investigating the company, but Jolley said 
the company is allowed to do business in California. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica members reportedly were told they could save money on long-distance 
telephone calls and airline tickets. The company charged people $3,200 to 
become sales representatives, who could earn commissions and bonuses by 
recruiting other representatives and club members. 
</P>
<P>
Florida Statewide Prosecutor Peter Antonacci said that recruitment practice 
constituted a pyramid scheme, which is inherently fraudulent because if every 
eligible person were to become a sales representative, those signing up last 
would have no one to recruit and no way of earning the promised return on 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica received at least $8.2 million in Florida through the sale of more 
than 2,500 director-level sales positions since it began its Florida operations 
in March, according to the office of Florida Comptroller Gerald Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
More than 98% of the $33 million in gross income reported by FundAmerica during 
the first four months of 1990 came from the recruitment plan, according to 
Lewis' office. 
</P>
<P>
Bizzarro, the Florida attorney general's spokesman, said there is an active 
warrant for Edwards' arrest in England in connection with an alleged unlawful 
pyramid scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Florida officials said that FundAmerica's offices in Irvine were searched 
Thursday by the Orange County district attorney's office. They said county 
prosecutors and the California secretary of state's office are assisting 
Florida authorities in their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
FundAmerica officials in Irvine could not be reached for comment late Thursday.

<P>
Ford Motor Co. said Thursday that it has received three offers for its Ford 
Aerospace Corp. defense subsidiary, including one from Hughes Aircraft Co. in 
El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Ford spokesman Tom Rhoades in Dearborn, Mich., declined to disclose the bid 
prices, but sources have estimated the going price may be about $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it expects to select the final bidder by next week. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades said one of the three bids was a joint offer from Hughes Aircraft Co. 
in El Segundo and Alcatel Co. of France. Sources say that Alcatel wants to buy 
Ford's commercial satellite business, while Hughes wants the subsidiary's 
defense businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes spokesman Richard Dore said the company will neither confirm nor deny 
its involvement in any potential acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
The other bids were from Loral Corp., a New York defense electronics company, 
and a team of companies including Westinghouse Electric Corp., the investment 
firm Carlyle Group, and Aerospatiale of France, which is connected with the 
Airbus aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Loral spokeswoman Elizabeth Allen confirmed that the company had submitted a 
bid but declined to disclose details or say when she expected a decision from 
Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor put its Newport Beach-based Ford Aerospace unit up for sale on Jan. 
12, saying it wanted to focus on its automotive operations. Analysts originally 
estimated that the company would draw bids of more than $1 billion, but sources 
say the depressed state of the defense industry led to lower bids. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace has revenue of about $2 billion a year, two thirds of it from 
the defense sector. The company employs 17,000 people, including more than 
3,000 at its Aeroneutronic division in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The company's products and operations include the Sidewinder air-to-air 
missile, space communications satellites and support work for NASA in Houston.

STYLE: SHAPELY ADULTS FIND BABY DOLLS FLATTERING; 
</P>
<P>
THE SHEER FABRICS OF THESE HIGH-WAIST, LOW-NECKLINE DRESSES SHOW OFF THE 
WEARER'S SILHOUETTE, AND THEY CAN COME IN ANYTHING FROM A VICTORIAN TO '60S 
CHIC LOOK.

They're called baby dolls, but you won't find them hanging around the lingerie 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, many of them look like negligees, with their filmy, see-through fabrics, 
low necklines and thigh-high skirts, but these baby dolls aren't pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
Baby doll is a generic term for dresses that have full, flowing silhouettes. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically it's a float dress -- it floats from the body and it's usually 
real short," says Holly Sharp, a Costa Mesa-based fashion designer who has seen 
her line of baby dolls become one of the hottest new street looks. 
</P>
<P>
"The dresses have a high waist and a low neck, like the kind worn by Napoleon's 
wife, Josephine," Sharp says. "I've always liked that silhouette. I was one of 
the first designers to do baby dolls, and now we're selling tons of them." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, since introducing baby dolls 18 months ago, Sharp says she's sold about 
30,000 of the dresses. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out selling them to high-fashion stores on Melrose Avenue, then 
Bullock's bought them and blew them out," she says. "Now I'm selling to all of 
the major chains." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, boutique owners can hardly keep baby dolls in stock. 
</P>
<P>
"All of my baby dolls are going fast," says Rose LeDonne, owner of the Rose 
LeDonne contemporary sportswear boutique in Dana Point. "My customers who are a 
little more fashion-forward really want them." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp designed her first baby doll while expecting a baby of her own. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd wear the baby doll while I was pregnant and got a lot of compliments on 
the street," she says. 
</P>
<P>
What keeps the virtually shapeless baby dolls from looking like maternity 
dresses is their sheer fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Filmy materials such as chiffon, a popular choice among baby doll designers, 
allow slender silhouettes to show through. Anyone hoping to hide a few pounds 
beneath those yards of material will be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"Baby dolls are very strong for the figure-conscious customer," says Laura 
Downing, owner of Laura -- The Unique Boutique in Laguna Beach, who has 
temporarily sold out of her baby dolls. 
</P>
<P>
For modesty's sake, Sharp adds a slip to wear underneath her dresses, but women 
have found other ways to wear their baby dolls without revealing too much. 
</P>
<P>
Some wear their baby dolls over "catsuits," those one-piece unitards that fit 
snugly over the body like a giant stocking. Others wear them over lace leggings 
and a bustier, biker shorts or tight denim shorts and tank tops. 
</P>
<P>
The baby doll can be interpreted in endless fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"They remind me of the Shirley Temple look," Sharp says. 
</P>
<P>
Many of her designs have "real big, fun, floppy collars," loose sleeves and 
empire waists. 
</P>
<P>
One of her baby dolls comes in sheer black georgette with red and orange 
flowers and has a wide, pointed collar with a low V-neck, an empire waist and a 
short skirt. The baby doll is available for $170 at Bullock's in South Coast 
Plaza, Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Sharp's designs look like something out of "The Great Gatsby." 
</P>
<P>
She created a sheer baby doll in solid black or white with long sleeves, a 
floppy collar, and a drop-waist skirt that falls below the knees, available for 
$194 at Bullock's. The same style comes in a floral print with red, purple and 
gold flowers against an ivory background. 
</P>
<P>
Another of her old-fashioned baby dolls comes in white with bow fasteners down 
the front and a drop waist with a softly pleated long skirt, for $150. 
</P>
<P>
"When I style them I see them as Victorian," Sharp says. A few styles feature 
pearly buttons down the front and scoop necklines. 
</P>
<P>
Other baby dolls have a '60s look, thanks to wilder prints and those short, 
short hemlines. One short-sleeved style by Bon Chic Bon Genre is made out of a 
multicolored sheer fabric that has a tie-dyed look. The baby doll sells for $88 
at Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
Rose LeDonne carries a sleeveless baby doll in solid white or black rayon with 
a short, full skirt and large buttons down the front for $98. 
</P>
<P>
Elisabetta Rogiani, a Los Angeles-based designer who created the tank dress, 
also has a line of fluid chiffon baby dolls. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a softer silhouette to go over stretch lace," Rogiani says. "I wanted 
something loose but feminine." 
</P>
<P>
Rogiani has experimented liberally with the silhouette, designing baby dolls 
with uneven hemlines that are several inches shorter in front, and switching 
from bold floral prints to smaller flowers to create "a '40s antique look." 
</P>
<P>
By adding different accessories, baby dolls can go from punk to romantic. 
</P>
<P>
"You can wear them with a crocheted sweater and those funky big black shoes 
with little white socks," Rogiani says. 
</P>
<P>
"You can wear them with cowboy boots for that '70s western feeling. I've seen a 
lot of women wearing them with platform shoes and peace signs. Others wear them 
with a big cross around their necks." 
</P>
<P>
Some women wear them with a heavy pendant necklace and shoulder duster 
earrings. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby doll is so simple, it's like a canvas," Rogiani says. "You can paint 
what you want on it."

COOPERATION OPENS TRAILS TO MOUNTAIN BIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Everybody's buying mountain bikes. More than 70% of the bikes sold these days 
are of the fat-tired variety, and while most of these never stray from the 
asphalt, lots of folks are heading for the hills. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, that has spelled conflict with other, more established 
trail users, namely hikers and horseback riders. And often, the bicyclists lose 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Orange County, word has come down that mountain bikers will be shut out 
of Upper Newport Bay Regional Park, at least for now. In some other areas, 
bikes are allowed on unpaved roads but are banned on narrow hiking and 
equestrian trails, called "single-tracks." 
</P>
<P>
Critics complain that mountain bikers damage delicate trails and ride too fast, 
risking collisions with other trail users and sometimes spooking horses. But 
cyclists say that trail damage is actually less than that caused by equestrians 
and that mountain biking on the single-tracks is safe when done responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
One place where the parties have been able to bury their differences is Chino 
Hills State Park, 10,000 acres of rolling, grass-covered hills, oak groves and 
sycamore-lined canyons smack in the middle of one of the fastest-growing areas 
of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Chino Hills, which includes parts of Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties, will someday be one of the most-visited spots in the state 
park system, park officials predict. But for now it remains a largely 
undiscovered and undeveloped bit of rural backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who have discovered the park -- and continue to discover it in 
increasing numbers -- are mountain bikers. But in January, 1989, the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation released its mountain bike use policy, and 
single-tracks in Chino Hills were immediately closed to bikers. Trails could 
only be reopened under written order from department officials. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Donald Murphy, in charge of Chino Hills, set up a series of 
public hearings to develop a plan for joint-use trails. And, lo and behold, 
trail users worked together. The result: Five trails have been designated for 
multiple use and, pending final state approval, could be open within the month. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wanted to lose multiple-use trails, and there was a real cooperative 
feeling," said John Kelso-Shelton, chief ranger for the park. "We're sort of a 
rarity at Chino Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Cunningham, who builds custom mountain bikes in Placentia, spearheaded 
the effort for the cyclists. "We all realized we were going to be seriously out 
of luck if we didn't work together," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
After the five trails were proposed, Cunningham organized more than 30 
volunteers to repair the paths, and in some sections completely rebuild them. 
Now, when combined with dirt roads in the park, mountain bikers will be able to 
choose from loop trips that vary from easy jaunts of five miles to rugged 
journeys of 20 miles and more. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that bicycles have a place on every trail in every state 
park," Cunningham said. "With the five trails they picked, there should be no 
reason to use anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Coming up at Chino Hills: Horse enthusiasts might get some trails of their own. 
"The equestrians are up next," Cunningham said, "and we promised to work with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Orange County's other state park, the single tracks were never 
closed (regional superintendents have broad leeway under the state mountain 
bike policy). Crystal Cove State Park north of Laguna Beach is one of the most 
popular mountain bike spots in the county, with as many as 80% of the users 
getting about on two wheels. 
</P>
<P>
Trail tips: Despite the efforts of Ward and Cunningham to educate riders, 
conflicts continue to arise because of mountain bikers who ride recklessly, 
endangering other trail users and damaging trails. 
</P>
<P>
Some simple tips will help reduce conflicts and help keep the parks open to 
cyclists: 
</P>
<P>
* Always ride on designated roads and trails. Never cut your own trail. The 
parks here are too heavily used to accommodate trailblazers. 
</P>
<P>
* Always control your speed, especially around corners. Slow down when 
approaching hikers, and announce your presence -- bicycles are silent. Stop to 
let horses pass. 
</P>
<P>
* Always ride on the right side of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
* For your own safety, wear a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
The fire that blackened much of Chino Hills State Park last week burned mostly 
grass, damaging only a few pockets of trees. Fire is part of the natural cycle 
here, and the park will be green again in just a few months. 
</P>
<P>
The park is open in the meantime, but it is especially important to remain on 
the trails while riding through the burn areas. Without ground cover, the soil 
is especially vulnerable to erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Lightning strikes: The recent lightning storm on Mt. Whitney that took the life 
of a Huntington Beach man was not an unusual occurrence. Sierra thunderstorms 
are quite common in summer, and there are precautions hikers can take if one 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
First, lightning seeks out the highest point, so try to avoid peaks and 
ridgelines. Also, do not hold tent poles or other metal objects. Cave entrances 
may seem to offer refuge but can be dangerous. Some experts advise insulating 
yourself from the ground by sitting on a rope or sleeping pad. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra thunderstorms offer another danger. Since they usually strike in the 
afternoon, the day can dawn warm and clear. Day hikers often set off in shorts 
and a T-shirt, risking hypothermia -- an often fatal lowering of the body 
temperature -- when they are caught unawares. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Inskeep of the Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Team advises that when 
walking any distance into the wilderness, even in summer, hikers always pack a 
jacket and wool hat -- "something that will keep you warm if you keep wet." 
</P>
<P>
He has pulled more than one hypothermia victim from the wilderness on days that 
started out bright and beautiful. Hikers, he said, are often not prepared for 
emergencies: "That's what keeps rescue teams in business, I guess."

The Pacific Symphony has balanced its budget of $4,867,650 for the past season, 
orchestra officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific raised $1,317,000 for its sustaining fund, 30% more than through 
fund-raising efforts last year. Ticket sales provided $2,529,000, an amount 5% 
above the record set last year for ticket sale income. 
</P>
<P>
(Monies from contracted services, such as playing for visiting ballet 
companies, provided the remainder.) 
</P>
<P>
By balancing the budget, the Pacific also will become eligible for a $100,000 
grant from the James Irvine Foundation, contingent upon the foundation's 
receiving an independent audit of the orchestra's budget, which officials 
expect to be completed late summer.

RANDY LEWIS: COSTA MESA COUNCIL: GANG THAT COULDN'T SHOOT STRAIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'd hate to see the Costa Mesa City Council get into an Old West-type gunfight 
-- they'd probably shoot themselves in the foot trying to draw. That's what 
happened this week when the council attempted to disarm an escalating 
controversy over city funding of arts groups -- then immediately started 
playing favorites with who is or isn't subject to its new law governing how 
arts groups can spend city money. 
</P>
<P>
The council deserves some praise for rejecting one proposal that was impossibly 
vague and frighteningly far-reaching. It would have precluded anyone getting 
city arts money from doing anything to "visually (or) verbally, deliberately 
denigrate anyone's race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, physical 
handicap, marital status, sex or age." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, on the recommendation of the city attorney, the new law restricts the 
groups from using city money "for the conduct of any religious or political 
activity." (I wonder how long it'll take for someone to raise a ruckus about 
all those religious cantatas and such that choral groups are always doing. 
Singers: scratch your Bach.) 
</P>
<P>
The measure also contains a clause -- whiplash from all the clamor over the 
National Endowment for the Arts having funded a couple of controversial 
photography exhibits -- outlawing grantees from using their money for "obscene" 
matters and defining "obscene" in accordance with the state penal code. 
</P>
<P>
The council could have gone one step further and made sure that it would be up 
to a court of law to determine what is or isn't obscene. As it is, the American 
Civil Liberties Union has voiced concern that any citizen who raises a question 
about a given artwork may just try throwing the issue back at the council 
members for a ruling. The city attorney pledges that this won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
The real gaffe here, though, is the selective application of this new 
"standard." Affected will be the 13 local groups that have been approved for 
1990-91 city grants, from South Coast Repertory and Orange County Philharmonic 
Society to the Master Chorale of Orange County and Opera Pacific. This adds up 
to $175,000 in Costa Mesa dollars. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials said the anti-obscenity, anti-politicking, 
anti-proselytizing law will not apply to the $400,000 they recently handed over 
to organizers of the Festival of Britain -- Orange County, essentially a number 
of arts events to help draw attention to a big retail promotion based at South 
Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Hmmmm. 
</P>
<P>
Think it has anything to do with the fact that the city of Costa Mesa is a 
co-sponsor of the festival, whose main aim seems to be to boost sales at the 
mall? 
</P>
<P>
The city says there is no double standard. The reason, officials say, that the 
new law won't be applied to the BritFest is simple: That money came out of the 
general fund, not the special fund set aside for cultural arts groups. 
</P>
<P>
Oh. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly wouldn't have anything to do with not wanting to cross the rich 
and powerful Segerstrom family, which owns the mall. Could it? 
</P>
<P>
Naaaaaaaaaah. 
</P>
<P>
The most mind-boggling thing about this whole episode is that some of the same 
groups that have been awarded city arts grants will also be receiving BritFest 
dollars for participating in that event. 
</P>
<P>
What happens if some citizen complains about something that South Coast 
Repertory or Opera Pacific stages during BritFest -- and don't think those 
moral watchdogs won't have their eyes and ears cocked and be ready to jump on 
any potentially offensive word or image. 
</P>
<P>
I guess if any Costa Mesa cultural arts grant dollars are involved, they may be 
in trouble, but if it's subsidized by city BritFest dollars, they are in the 
clear. Talk about the need for creative bookkeeping. 
</P>
<P>
Where's the consistency or logic here? (If anyone spots a shred of either, call 
toll free, 1-800-LA-TIMES, and explain it to me, OK?) But then, this is the 
same city that passed a law making it OK to arrest people who looked like they 
might be thinking about maybe soliciting a (gasp!) job. 
</P>
<P>
It makes anyone who thinks that the arts are a good and noble component of a 
city's image want to hang his head in shame -- especially when you consider how 
Los Angeles officials, in announcing $3 million in city grants recently, 
forcefully and unequivocally voiced their support for arts activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of these grants," Los Angeles Councilman Joel Wachs said. "They 
represent the cultural pluralism . . . and the widest range of viewpoints and 
beliefs which we originally envisioned in proposing the L.A. Endowment for the 
Arts. The grants (demonstrate) our recognition that artists have something to 
offer our city . . . and should be valued and compensated for that." 
</P>
<P>
It's a far cry from the Costa Mesa councilwoman who expressed disappointment 
that even stricter limitations weren't placed on city arts grants. 
</P>
<P>
Seems like when it comes to the arts, the Costa Mesa City Council is digging 
its heels into the dirt, putting both hands on its six-guns and saying, with a 
sneer, "This town ain't big enough for both of us."

FED CHIEF BIDS ADIEU TO '80S EXCESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM REDBURN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's official: As far as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is concerned, 
the money-mad '80s are over. 
</P>
<P>
Just in time, too. Junk bonds, leveraged buyouts, hot real estate markets and 
excessive borrowing in general are finally being reined in. That may seem 
painful to those caught in the middle of the credit squeeze, Greenspan 
believes, but the ultimate gain from wringing out the financial abuses of the 
1980s is likely to be a healthier economy in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The current reduction in lending by banks and thrifts, which has hit 
particularly hard at builders of commercial real estate and housing, "has its 
roots in part in the excesses of the 1980s," Greenspan argued in congressional 
testimony this week. "The weaker credits extended during that decade have come 
home to roost." 
</P>
<P>
While he did not come right out and admit it, Greenspan's remarks represent a 
kind of mea culpa for him as well. 
</P>
<P>
"As one of those who celebrated the deregulation of the 1980s, Greenspan shares 
responsibility for some of the disasters, too," said David Hale, chief 
economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. "What his testimony amounts 
to is an implicit criticism of how the private sector behaved and how the 
public sector failed." 
</P>
<P>
For months now, home builders, small-business leaders and key lawmakers have 
been complaining of a widespread "credit crunch" as banks and savings 
institutions started to curb many of their riskier loans. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did last year's S&amp;L cleanup law impose higher standards on thrifts 
in a bid to avoid a rerun of the costly taxpayer bailout, but federal 
regulators also moved to discourage banks from making similar loans -- 
particularly to real estate developers -- to prevent them from falling into the 
same trap. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after resisting pleas to relax its grip on credit, Greenspan 
conceded that slightly lower interest rates are useful as a counterweight to 
some of the more restrictive lending practices. And in testimony before the 
Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Wednesday, he hinted 
that further modest cuts might be needed if the credit squeeze gets worse. 
</P>
<P>
But he devoted much of his statement to explaining why he thinks too much debt 
was created over the last decade without adequate regard to whether it was 
going into productive investments. What the nation needs in the early 1990s, he 
argued, is to curb unnecessary lending today before it sows the seeds tomorrow 
of another financial collapse even worse than the S&amp;L disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The borrowing spree of the 1980s, Greenspan admitted, clearly got out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the loans made during the 1980s should not, by historical standards of 
credit-worthiness, have been made," the Fed chairman argued. "As standards 
reverted closer to normal, those weaker borrowers have been finding it far more 
difficult to access credit." 
</P>
<P>
It's not a pleasant process to watch. Along much of the East Coast, 
particularly around Boston and New York, local economies are clearly in 
recession, with many businesses and state governments reeling from the 
downturn. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, a key engine of growth throughout much of the 1980s boom, 
has cooled dramatically. The result has been a shakeout among overbuilt 
retailers and a sharp drop in television and newspaper advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Pursuing a relatively tight money policy, the Fed has discreetly welcomed much 
of this economic slowdown as needed to prevent a revival of higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, Greenspan worried, lending restrictions by banks may have swung 
too far in the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
"The tightening is beginning to have very real, unwelcome effects," he said. 
"It is difficult to discern the dividing line between lending standards that 
are still healthy and those that are so restrictive as to be inconsistent with 
the borrower's status and the best interests of the lender in the long run. In 
recent weeks, however, we may have slipped over that line." 
</P>
<P>
Much of what is happening today was foreseeable as an outcome of the 
long-delayed S&amp;L cleanup. Back in early 1989, when President Bush first 
offered his bailout plan, a wide variety of experts predicted that roughly 
doubling capital requirements for banks and S&amp;Ls to 6% would force 
financial institutions to cut back on some lending. 
</P>
<P>
"As we move toward tougher capital requirements," First Interstate Bank 
economist Jerry Jordan said then, "the response of most managers will be to 
shrink their assets to conform with their existing capital base rather than try 
to raise new funds." 
</P>
<P>
That's just what many financial institutions have done. To provide a more 
substantial cushion of their own funds to cover bad loans, a significant number 
of banks have curbed new lending while hundreds of thrifts have been taken over 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
To most Americans, these changes have imposed little hardship, particularly 
since deposits up to $100,000 are covered by federal insurance and home 
mortgages and credit cards are available from a wide variety of sources. 
</P>
<P>
But after nearly a decade-long building boom fueled by easy credit and 
favorable tax breaks, the tougher new banking rules imposed on top of an 
overbuilt housing and office building market are producing agonizing withdrawal 
pains among construction firms and real estate developers. 
</P>
<P>
While today's cutbacks may be traumatic, they should be less painful than the 
sharp recessions that have ended every previous decade since the 1950s. "For 
the nation as a whole," Greenspan explained, "the tightening of credit 
standards will leave the financial system on a sounder footing and contribute 
to economic stability in the long run."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS: AVOIDING CONSUMER CONTRACT WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As contracts go, it's pretty specific: People who sign up with a Los Angeles 
pest control company for "a minimum" of a year are billed and serviced every 
two months, with "additional services" necessary to "control pest activity" 
included. After that year, service continues until canceled in writing 30 days 
ahead. "Customer satisfaction" is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
But the pests weren't party to the agreement, and when bugs continued to 
appear, some customers canceled their contracts and stopped paying. In return, 
the company kept billing, threatening late penalties, "collection" and "legal 
action." 
</P>
<P>
"Can they keep harassing you?" asks one customer, overlooking the fact that one 
man's harassment is another's righteous pursuit. Of course they can, but 
consumers have any number of possible responses, from paying the bill to filing 
a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious problem with consumer contracts involving installment service -- 
pest control, security, dating services, weight-loss clinics, educational 
seminars, even magazine subscriptions -- is that one buys future performance. 
Satisfactions or dissatisfactions don't surface until next month, the month 
after or later -- well after any applicable "cooling off" period that gave the 
consumers several days to rescind an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies ease the situation with money-back guarantees -- magazines, for 
example, which often refund the "unused" portion of subscription fees. Some 
offer trial periods of service free or for nominal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer contracts in general present some problems. For starters, says Richard 
Elbrecht, supervising attorney of legal services in the state Department of 
Consumer Affairs, "most don't cover anything of importance to the consumer but 
a host of things important to the seller." 
</P>
<P>
Specific restrictions must be noted. When a contract, such as the one above 
from Day &amp; Nite Pest Control, has such specific instruction for 
cancellation after the first year, this probably doesn't mean it can be 
canceled any time. 
</P>
<P>
General promises should be questioned. In California's pest control industry, 
"satisfaction guaranteed" usually means "if pests come back between service 
(visits), we'll come back out," says John Munro, director of education for the 
trade group Pest Control Operators of California. But when and how often? 
customers might ask, their patience sorely tried by "the limited number of 
times the company could come," says Los Angeles dentist Kathleen Stambaugh. 
Sometimes, furthermore, they "didn't come, or came two hours late," says public 
relations executive Frank Widder. 
</P>
<P>
"Customer satisfaction guaranteed" may actually be more generous than most 
companies intend, if they don't limit what they'll do if someone is not 
satisfied or what constitutes "satisfaction." Will they just come out again? Or 
cheerfully refund money? Is satisfaction objectively defined by an absence of 
pests? If not otherwise qualified, "satisfaction guaranteed means subjective, 
not objective satisfaction," says Herschel Elkins, California's assistant 
attorney general in charge of consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
Given a form contract, consumers had better add their own concerns and 
expectations, trying to "come to a real understanding with the other party," 
says Elbrecht, "about what they're getting and what comes along with it." Day 
&amp; Nite's president, Kevin O'Connor, for example, says he sometimes 
negotiates "open contracts" with people who "might be moving" or who are "not 
sure if (they're) going to stick with you." 
</P>
<P>
Even when they're not expressed, consumers may have rights under such 
contracts. Under state warranty laws, most consumer goods are sold with an 
implied warranty of "merchantability" guaranteeing that they'll do what they're 
supposed to do; i.e., toasters should toast. Conceivably, pest control should 
"control" pests; most such laws deal with goods, not services, but one can, 
says Elbrecht, "apply them by analogy, and courts have done it." 
</P>
<P>
Many people, unfortunately, do their roughest negotiating -- if that's the 
right word -- when the arrangement falls apart. Companies start by threatening, 
over and again, to turn the account over to a collection agency. They also 
threaten dire effects on the customer's credit rating if either they or their 
collection agency report to a credit reporting agency, and some threaten to 
sue. 
</P>
<P>
These are significant threats. Indeed, consumers fighting small bills suddenly 
find themselves weighing the possibility that something will end up on a credit 
report or in court, and their involvement will become very time consuming, if 
not a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
They have similar weapons, of course, starting with the threat to contact some 
pertinent government office. The state Structural Pest Control Board, for one, 
sends such complaints to companies involved, giving them 10 days to respond, 
usually with a promise to treat the place again. 
</P>
<P>
But with five investigators statewide, that's it: "If someone's willing to come 
out again," says Los Angeles social worker Susanna Des Jardien, who has had 
trouble with both pests and pest control companies, "the fact that he's coming 
out to treat them with snake oil is not of interest to them." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can fight adverse credit reports (if not very effectively) by 
inserting a letter of denial in their credit file. They, too, can threaten to 
sue; in fact, "everybody threatens suit now," says Kevin O'Connor, "even over 
$40." Given such amounts, small claims court (typically, for disputes involving 
less than $2,000) may satisfy either party, since it can not only require 
compensation for those injured but performance or cancellation of a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the most efficient resolution of contract disputes is to argue it all 
out before signing. No one can think of everything, but they should try.

DISPUTE OVER CLEAN AIR TEMPORARILY SLOWS FLOW OF ALASKA OIL TO WEST COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It looked for a moment as if the Trans-Alaska Pipeline might shut down Thursday 
-- threatening oil supplies for the West Coast -- but a crisis was averted 
after a court decision. 
</P>
<P>
As a deadline for meeting federal air pollution laws passed Thursday, state and 
federal environmental officials found themselves eyeball to eyeball with the 
pipeline's operators. The federal Environmental Protection Agency had set 
Thursday as the deadline for Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. to comply with the 
federal Clean Air Act or face action that could have included fines of up to 
$25,000 per day per violation. 
</P>
<P>
Alyeska was not so impolitic as to make a direct threat, but the company that 
operates the 800-mile pipeline went so far as to curtail the flow of oil for 
about 4 1/2 hours Thursday afternoon, to as low as 1.2 million barrels per day 
from the normal rate of 1.8 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Alyeska suggested at one point that the oil flow might be cut completely. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for California, which gets about 47% of its crude oil from Alaska, 
that didn't come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Alyeska, which is owned by seven major oil companies, won a 
reprieve from a federal court judge Thursday afternoon that effectively put the 
deadline on hold. A hearing is scheduled for July 27 to consider a further 
delay in enforcement of EPA rules. Late Thursday, Alyeska agreed to boost the 
flow of Alaskan oil to its normal levels. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation 
said they had reached agreement with Alyeska to proceed with talks aimed at 
getting Alyeska to meet the state's own clean-air requirements. 
</P>
<P>
At issue were charges leveled last month by the state Department of 
Environmental Conservation and the EPA that Alyeska is producing improper 
levels of air pollution from pump stations along the pipeline and from oil 
storage tanks at Alyeska's marine terminal in Valdez, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Alyeska denies that curtailing pipeline operations was meant as a threat. "If 
we couldn't be in compliance by midnight deadline, the only way not to be out 
of compliance would to not be running," said an Alyeska spokeswoman who 
requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
But state and EPA officials said they saw no reason Alyeska needed to curtail 
oil flow. "I think that they wanted to crank up some leverage," said Dennis 
Kelso, Alaska state commissioner for environmental conservation. "The state's 
requirements did not in any way cause them to have to shut down the pipeline. 
That was their decision; I don't know what their motivation was, but it was 
wholly unnecessary."

UNSECURED CREDITORS OFFER PROPOSAL TO SEIZE CONTROL OF AMERICAN CONTINENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unsecured creditors of bankrupt American Continental Corp., joining forces with 
federal thrift regulators, have filed a plan in federal court in Phoenix that 
would give creditors $21 million and control of the one-time parent of Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the ouster of top American Continental officers, liquidation 
of the company and lawsuits against those responsible for the company's demise. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the plan, filed late Wednesday, were released Thursday in U.S. 
District Court in Arizona, where the plan must be approved before it goes into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also is subject to a separate agreement with American Continental 
bondholders, who have held $275 million of worthless stock since the company 
filed for bankruptcy in April, 1989. Lawyers for the bondholders helped to form 
the reorganization plan and hope to sign the agreement within a week, said 
Ronald Rus of Orange, one of their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The coordinated plan is a significant step in the massive litigation involving 
American Continental's bankruptcy and the failure of its Lincoln Savings unit 
in Irvine, which regulators say will be one of the costliest thrift fiascoes in 
the nation with a taxpayer bill of more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the creditors committee had announced a tentative agreement with 
regulators, but bondholders' lawyers were not consulted and objected to certain 
terms. Bondholders joined in the new effort, though they have yet to sign the 
separate agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization plan is the first complete proposal filed with the court 
since American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection. The company had 
filed an outline of a proposed plan a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would provide bondholders with $14 million to $16 million and would 
eliminate competing claims for remaining corporate assets made by bondholders, 
other unsecured creditors and the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency 
running Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Under the pending agreement with bondholders, it also would remove the RTC-run 
Lincoln as a defendant in 17 class-action suits filed by bondholders and would 
create a committee of creditors and regulators to pursue all legal claims 
against American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr., his executives 
and the company's professional advisers. 
</P>
<P>
"This solidifies a natural alliance between RTC and the securities holders' 
lawyers," said Michael Manning, a Phoenix lawyer for the RTC. "Now there will 
be a joint effort against those who defrauded the public and the regulatory 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Except for dropping Lincoln from the class-action suits, the agreement does not 
affect either that litigation or the RTC's $1.1-billion civil racketeering suit 
against Keating and others. Lincoln's former owners also are targets of various 
federal and state criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization plan and related documents must be reviewed at a minimum of 
two court hearings and would not be approved by the court for at least two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental management will strongly oppose the plan and put forth its 
own ideas, Keating said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Keating called the plan "a fraud, a charade on the securities holders of ACC 
and a fraud on the government, in the final analysis." Keating asserted that 
regulators were trying to get off cheaply when they were the ones who caused 
the collapse of Lincoln and American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
The joint effort against him, he said, also is "typical" of government efforts 
to do "everything they can to put us out of business, break (American 
Continental), put us in jail and shut out truth and facts." 
</P>
<P>
Keating, who had been kept informed of the progress of the plan, said he asked 
the creditors committee in late May to include a provision that would allow a 
new Keating-led company called Leland Financial Corp. to purchase $500 million 
worth of assets, including the S&amp;L's 20% stake in General Oriental 
Investments Ltd., an international investing firm headed by British financier 
Sir James Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said he believed that regulators would dump the General Oriental stock 
for much less than its value, which he estimated at $215 million. With no money 
down, he said, he could repay the purchase price within five years and also 
make $50 million at the end of the second year specifically for bondholders. 
Otherwise, he charged, regulators would sell those assets to others at 
discounts totaling $200 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
The General Oriental stock was part of the outline of Keating's reorganization 
plan for American Continental, which was filed last year. The plan, which 
lacked the needed regulatory cooperation, was never completed.

IN DANA POINT, 2 OCEANFRONT GEMS ARE FOR SALE; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: THEY ARE TWO OF THE LARGEST UNDEVELOPED COASTAL PARCELS IN 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ONE MAY BE BOUGHT BY THE JAPANESE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
There is nothing as crass as a "for sale" sign on two of the largest 
undeveloped parcels on the Southern California coast. But the two Dana Point 
properties are for sale nevertheless, and people in this quiet Orange County 
beach town have been wondering for months what will happen to the land. 
</P>
<P>
Now they have a few clues. 
</P>
<P>
One parcel, a 232-acre swatch at Monarch Beach owned by the debt-ridden 
Australian company Qintex, will probably be sold in the next few months, said 
the accountant presiding over the sale of Qintex assets. 
</P>
<P>
Among the possible buyers, he said, are two big Japanese concerns that own half 
of Qintex's three other resorts and hold an option to buy half of the Monarch 
Beach property. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex had planned to build a $1-billion resort on the Monarch Beach property 
and a nearby parcel before the company slid into receivership late last year. 
</P>
<P>
The receiver, John Allpass of accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick's office in 
Brisbane, Australia, said this week that negotiations to sell the property 
continue and that a deal is expected "shortly." 
</P>
<P>
Allpass wouldn't say who is trying to buy the land. But the Japanese concerns 
-- the consumer credit company Nippon Shinpan and the huge trading firm Mitsui 
&amp; Co. -- are a possibility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex executives didn't return phone calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qintex was also going to build another hotel on property called the 
Headlands about a mile south on Pacific Coast Highway. Qintex had an option to 
buy the land but lost it when it couldn't meet the payments late last year. 
These 115 acres atop a bluff are the town's most prominent geographic feature 
and a local landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The owners -- the wealthy Chandler and Sherman families -- don't seem in a 
hurry to sell. But a source familiar with the families' business affairs said 
Thursday that the property is for sale again and that an arm of the New York 
financial services firm Morgan Stanley Group Inc. has been hired to market it. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of interest in it," the source said. "But until somebody actually 
signs a check, it just means they like the view." 
</P>
<P>
The families' representatives wouldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
The price is likely to be more than the $120 million that Qintex agreed to last 
time, real estate brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
But this time the land may be harder to sell, even though it's one of the last 
large undeveloped beachfront parcels so close to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Whoever buys it must still get permission from the city to build. 
While Dana Point has zoned the land for a resort hotel, sentiment to keep the 
wind-swept bluffs vacant is said by local officials to be growing. And Dana 
Point will soon reconsider the zoning of the entire city in a series of public 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
A number of investors who could afford it, however -- including Japanese 
investors, who like to buy resorts -- are said to be interested in buying, real 
estate brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex must sell the Monarch Beach property for more than $250 million to 
recoup the $242 million that it borrowed to buy the land and the interest that 
it's paid on the loan since, people familiar with the transaction said. The 
receiver would not disclose the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Headlands, though, the Monarch Beach property already has city 
permission to build a hotel, which may make it easier to sell. A 1,100-room 
copy of San Simeon's Hearst Castle has been approved, which if built would be 
one of the largest hotels on the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies' local offices referred questions to Japan, where executives 
couldn't be reached.

Money Supply Down: The Federal Reserve Board reported that the measure of the 
nation's money supply known as M2 fell in the week ended July 9 to a seasonally 
adjusted $3,274.8 billion from a revised $3,277.5 billion the week before. 
</P>
<P>
The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted 
$810.2 billion from a revised $817.7 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, 
deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus 
accounts such as savings deposits and money market mutual funds.

not be possible to engage the "park" mechanism even though the transmission 
shift control level is in the park position, causing the vehicle to roll when

Gillett Sells Baltimore TV Station: Gillett Group signed a letter of intent to 
sell NBC affiliate WMAR-TV in Baltimore for $154.7 million to Scripps Howard 
Broadcasting Co., a subsidiary of E. W. Scripps Co., the Cincinnati-based 
newspaper publisher and broadcaster. Gillett Group, controlled by Denver 
businessman George Gillett, has been under pressure to sell some of its TV 
station holdings to reduce debt. The transaction is also one of the few sales 
of a major-market TV station in the past year, after a slowdown in debt-driven, 
leveraged media deals.

NO BID TO DUCK LIABILITY, NEIL BUSH'S LAWYER SAYS

Spokesmen for Neil Bush said Thursday that the President's son was not trying 
to reduce personal liability resulting from his role in the failure of a Denver 
thrift when he listed his wife as owner of a $550,000 home purchased last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not even consulted on it regarding any liability and didn't know about 
it until the last couple of weeks," said James E. Nesland, Bush's lawyer, 
referring to reports about the Denver house published by newspapers in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bush and his wife, Sharon, were listed on the deed of the previous home 
they sold in 1988 to move to a house that a Bush associate described as "more 
secure." 
</P>
<P>
A financial planner for the President's son, who asked not to be named, said 
that listing the house as his wife's asset was for the purpose of "estate 
equalization." He said it was not intended to shelter Bush from liability 
resulting from any government, shareholder or depositor suits that may be filed 
against him for his role as a former director of Silverado Banking, Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Under unified estate tax credit provisions, a taxpayer can transfer to a spouse 
without tax liability up to $600,000 in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said a 
suit is under consideration against the former directors of Silverado alleging 
that they failed their fiduciary responsibility to protect the financial health 
of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance for Silverado's directors and officers to cover such suits was 
allowed to expire in April, 1986, and the S&amp;L set up its own $15-million 
indemnification fund. However, after Silverado's failure, the FDIC sued in 
federal court in Denver to take over the funds being held in escrow. The case 
is yet to be argued.

OVERALL MARKET DOWN, BUT OIL ISSUES LIFT DOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A late rally in oil company stocks drove blue chip issues into the plus column 
Thursday, overcoming a spate of disappointing corporate earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down about 20 at its mid-session low, 
closed with a 12.13 gain at 2,993.81, again putting the index just short of the 
elusive goal of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
But the broad market suffered: Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 
4-to-3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 621 
up, 858 down and 522 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled 162 million shares, 
down from Wednesday's 168.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was heaviest in over-the-counter issues, where the NASDAQ composite 
index lost 2.65 to 458.17. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil stocks have led this rally back," said George Pirrone of Dreyfus Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The oil stocks surge was prompted by rumors that Iraq might use force against 
Kuwait in their dispute over production quotas. The Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries meets next week to discuss prices. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco, Chevron and Exxon, all components of the Dow 30 index, gained 1 5/8 to 
61 3/8, 1 1/2 to 76 3/4 and 1 1/2 to 50, respectively. Elsewhere, Mobil jumped 
2 1/4 to 65 3/4, Arco added 1 3/4 to 125 1/2 and Unocal rose 1 to 30 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
In the broad market, high-tech earnings disappointments hit that sector hard, 
though bargain hunters entered late in the session. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer was off 2 7/8 to 41 3/4 after dropping to a low of 40 on a 
forecast by Apple's chairman that it would be difficult for earnings in the 
quarter ending Sept. 30 to match those of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lotus Development also sank on a weak earnings forecast for the current 
quarter, losing a substantial 6 1/8 at 25 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were also cautious after Wednesday's comments on interest rates by 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. The Fed chief, in testimony to 
Congress, said the central bank might lower interest rates further. But that 
gave some investors reason to question the Fed's resolve to fight inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
Among high-tech issues that plunged, Tandem Computers dropped 1 7/8 to 19 5/8 
after the company reported profit for the fiscal quarter ended June 30 of 30 
cents a share, against 31 cents in the 1989 period. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in high tech, Compaq fell 1 to 63 3/8, Teradata dropped 1 1/2 to 26 
1/2 and AST Research lost 1 3/4 to 23 3/4. Tandon lost 3/16 to 3 1/8, rallying 
back from a low of 2-11/16 after its earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
California bank and S&amp;L stocks were walloped on new fears of real estate 
losses. HomeFed plunged 4 3/4 to 14 1/4, Ahmanson fell 1 to 20 7/8, CalFed lost 
5/8 to 14 1/2, First Interstate sank 2 7/8 to 37 and Security Pacific lost 1 
1/8 to 34 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
New stock issue Modtech, the largest builder of modular classrooms in 
California, went public at 10 and closed at 12. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Shoe fell 4 1/4 to 18 after saying its second-quarter earnings may be 
below those of the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
American Ecology of Agoura Hills rocketed 2 to 10 1/4, continuing to surge on 
Tuesday's strong earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed mixed. The 225-share Nikkei average closed up 7.51 at 
33,055.62. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times stock index lost 14.7 to 2,387.3. In Frankfurt 
the 30-share DAX index drifted 8.80 lower to 1,957.24.

Bond Prices Mixed in Slow Trading 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished narrowly mixed in light dealings in the wake of a big 
slide Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there was little influential economic news, and prices remained 
in a narrow range for most of the day as a result. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 3/32 point, or about $1 per $1,000 
in face value, after losing $8 on Wednesday. Its yield rose to 8.55% from 
8.54%. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is in a holding pattern," said Carl Napolitano, a market strategist 
for R. C. Government Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve moved late last week to nudge the key federal funds rate 
down to 8% from 8.25%, and comments from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan on 
Wednesday indicated that a further easing is possible. But many traders remain 
wary of the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate was quoted at 8%, up from 7.938% late Wednesday.

Dollar Drifts Down in Dull Session 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended mostly lower in lackluster trading, with little news to affect 
the market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no real reason to buy or sell dollars," said Gabriele Schmitt, analyst 
at Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
The only market activity came from small traders taking profits, she said. "It 
was one of those choppy days that didn't have much reason behind it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 147.60 Japanese yen from 147.25 at 
Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 148.00 yen. In New York, one 
dollar bought 148.09 yen, up from 147.65 yen. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8155 from $1.8205 late Wednesday. In 
New York, one pound cost $1.8165, more expensive than $1.815 late Wednesday.

<P>
Pork Futures Drop Daily Trading Limit 
</P>
<P>
Prices of frozen pork belly futures plummeted the 2-cents-a-pound permitted 
daily limit for the second straight day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 
reflecting bountiful supplies and slack demand for bacon. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, livestock futures ended mostly lower, energy 
futures were mixed, grains and soybeans were mixed and precious metals 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen pork bellies settled 2 cents lower across the board, with the contract 
for delivery in July at 46.50 cents a pound and the more heavily traded August 
contract at 44.42 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Weak consumer demand for bacon, which is made from pork bellies, has weighed on 
the market for several weeks. The situation has been reflected in the narrowing 
gap between prices of fresh bellies on the cash market and frozen ones on the 
futures market. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the August contract for West Texas Intermediate oil rose 44 cents to 
$18.99 a 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Rumors of 
possible violence between Iraq and Kuwait helped, but prices also got a nudge 
from technical factors, and from word that the flow of crude through the Alaska 
pipeline was being reduced.

Occidental Petroleum Corp.: The Los Angeles-based company said its quarterly 
profit rose 11% to $89 million, despite a $134-million earnings decline in its 
chemical division. 
</P>
<P>
That unit earned $172 million, compared to $306 million a year ago. Sales were 
unchanged at $5.1 billion. The 1990 second-quarter results included an 
after-tax gain of $41 million from selling some domestic oil and gas 
properties. The company attributed the earnings decline in its chemical 
division to lower sale prices throughout the industry.

SCEcorp: The Rosemead parent of Southern California Edison Co. said 
second-quarter income rose 3% to $146 million. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue advanced fractionally to $1.59 billion. The firm said a recent 
California Public Utilities Commission decision shifted some of its earnings to 
the first, second and fourth quarters from the third quarter, with no impact on 
annual earnings. As a result of this change, quarter-to-quarter earnings 
comparisons are distorted.

BEHIND THE WHEEL / FERRARI 348TS: PERFORMANCE ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ferrari builds motor cars in much the same way Claude Monet painted landscapes 
-- not to please the populace, but more to satisfy self, a technique and a 
coterie. 
</P>
<P>
Mellowed by mystique and myth, living very high off racing legends, its 
reputation secured by a product-appreciation rate indeed close to that of 
Impressionist art, Ferrari sees no need to advertise its cars. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does this Italian company have a public relations representative in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The year 1990 is halfway into history. Yet Ferrari is just now getting around 
to introducing its 348 series sports car that actually was built last year but 
will still cost $103,400. Without a radio. Without a spare. 
</P>
<P>
All of which supports a sales-and-marketing rationale which seems to be this: 
Simply getting a Ferrari is the best deal a buyer can make. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such indifference, Ferrari sells everything it makes and may very well 
have been back-ordered since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
* A barely used Ferrari Testarossa currently costs $100,000 more than a new 
Testarossa. Because all new Testarossas have been sold out for the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
* A really used Ferrari -- a 250 GTO race car built in 1962 -- recently was 
bought by a Japanese collector for $14.6 million. GM should find such profit in 
selling 28-year-old cars. 
</P>
<P>
* Now the 1989-cum-1990 Ferrari 348ts is dribbling into Southern California 
showrooms. If you want one from Hollywood Sport Cars, don't expect to be 
impressing tourists on Melrose any time soon. "We got a couple of (deliveries) 
for June, but we don't know about July yet, and August is a long way off," said 
general manager Cris Vandagriff. "We're sold out three years in advance." 
</P>
<P>
Said a sales representative for Newport Imports of Newport Beach: Order your 
Ferrari 348 now. Pick it up some time after Memorial Day. That's Memorial Day 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
An obvious question: Is there anything in this world worth a six-year wait? 
</P>
<P>
The definite answers: Mr. or Ms. Right. Blue-eyed twins. Peace in Northern 
Ireland. A quit-claim deed to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Also a Ferrari 348ts. 
</P>
<P>
And not because it is an outrageously expensive car, a known quickener of 
pulses and envy. Nor because Magnum PI made it a virility heightener. But 
simply because a Ferrari is the best at what it was designed to do. 
</P>
<P>
Forget cost and image. Consider only purpose, craftsmanship and inexorable 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
By such measurement, the Rolls-Royce is the superlative of rich, regal 
transportation. At the other end of that scale, the humble, snuffling, 
pirouetting Hyster forklift becomes the ultimate example of vehicular utility. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrari, like no other motor car, assumes its place among the pure by being 
constructed around the lusty essence of a thinly disguised sports-racing car. 
</P>
<P>
Or as Enzo Ferrari explained before his death in 1988: "La Ferrari was born 
with racing and with racing it progressed and developed. Can the automobile 
deny its origins? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
And the urgent pedigree of the new 348 -- from the first ripping snort of its 
290-horsepower engine to the initial tug of broad tires biting like pit bulls 
-- remains an instantaneous suggestion to motor somewhere in a secure but 
horrendous hurry. Preferably beneath a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's 348ts and 348tb (for transversale spyder, or targa, and transversale 
berlinetta, or coupe) replace the enormously successful 308/328 series. 
</P>
<P>
They were handsome, powerful, fast and desirable. Yet not an impossible act to 
follow. Ferrari simply has crafted a successor that is better looking, 
stronger, faster and thoroughly irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
Styling, naturally, is by Pininfarina and sculptured heavily from aluminum and 
composites. It is a grand softening of the 308/328's swoopier lines and sharper 
edges, retaining enough of the old to satisfy those thinking of moving up, but 
adding touches of today for anyone intent on purchasing a milestone of the 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
The Testarossa's air intakes that feed left- and right-side radiators have been 
transferred to the 348. But they are smaller, aren't so obtrusive and are much 
less suggestive of cheese graters. 
</P>
<P>
Like the ears and orthodontics of Britain's royal family, the sloped nose, chin 
dam and hunkered-down derivatives of all modern Ferraris are with the 348. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there are distinctions. The 348 runs on 17-inch wheels (compared to 
16-inchers on the 328) that fill the wells better than Schwarzenegger fills a 
work shirt. 
</P>
<P>
The car is taller, wider and with a longer wheelbase than the 328. Overhangs 
are shorter, which further increases that crouch with the whole appearing 
blunter, more purposeful. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, amid all these aesthetics, there are uglies. 
</P>
<P>
The side air scoops are formed from composite panels screwed into the doors. 
The screw heads are Phillips, black, quite exposed and stick out like four zits 
on a bare shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The grille is also a yawning illusion, a dummy. It catches nothing but bugs and 
slow sparrows because the car's radiators are in its flanks where they breathe 
through the door intakes. 
</P>
<P>
But that's the classical look. Tradition dies kicking and struggling. Until the 
world gives up starched underwear and buttonholes in lapels, Ferrari likely 
won't give up grilles that go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Looks, however, are the least of the 348. 
</P>
<P>
Bore and stroke of Ferrari's 32-valve, V-8 engine have been increased with 
displacement improving from 3.1 to 3.4 liters. Changes in lubrication, 
electronic engine management and the design and layout of intake manifolds 
combine to increase power from 260 horsepower to 290. 
</P>
<P>
The 348 remains a mid-engined car. But the engine is now set north to south and 
longitudinally, instead of east to west and transversely, and that allows more 
room for improved things. 
</P>
<P>
A new gearbox and transmission (actually a carry-over from a Ferrari Formula 1 
racing car) is now mounted behind the engine instead of beneath it. So the 
entire power and timpani section has been lowered to reduce the car's center of 
gravity by about 2 inches. Ergo, flatter handling and better steering response. 
</P>
<P>
Race cars do not come with cruise control, automatic transmission and power 
steering. These are conveniences for car travel shared with sightseeing and 
chatty relatives -- but outright impediments to any bonding of man, machine, 
speed and road. 
</P>
<P>
So the 348's fixings and interior are quintessential Ferrari; unfrilled, all 
purpose, and with basic geometry everywhere. Hence, a plain, rectangular hood 
for instruments made stark by florescent orange numbers and needles on black 
dials. Also no radio. But the car is wired for one, should you ever prefer 
Ottmar Liebert's nouveau flamenco over the burbling snarl of Ferrari's four 
tailpipes. 
</P>
<P>
The gear lever is a tall, chromed stick with a bar billiards ball on top. It 
sprouts from a stainless steel gate that's a cattle guard masquerading as a 
shifting template. 
</P>
<P>
The horn. On a stalk? Hidden beneath a cornet symbol on the spokes? Nah. It's 
that old-fashioned button stuck right in the middle of a medieval Momo steering 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
Punch the brake and the accelerator is right there where it has been since the 
dawn of crash gear boxes -- flush and only an inch to one side of the brake 
pedal. Perfect for rolling the foot and sweet heel-and-toe shifting for moments 
when the road is empty, the corner is a clean sweep and the ghost of driving 
legend Alberto Ascari whispers to some of us. 
</P>
<P>
A Ferrari makes demands. It can even be an intimidating drive. The brakes are 
firm and not for the feather footed or high of heel. Gears are given up 
smoothly only when the moment, the engine, the clutch and shift are in concert. 
</P>
<P>
But finding that moment, being the conductor of a coordinated downshift, 
earning some respect from a benchmark machine that rises above the best of our 
abilities . . . ah, there's the defiance but also the satisfaction of Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
So we took the 348ts to Angeles Crest where even doing things legally and easy 
in a standard sedan means a succession of body rolls and agonizing shrieks from 
tires trying to swallow their rims. 
</P>
<P>
The Ferrari found this mountain road its primer. Whatever the suggested speed 
at any corner, the 348 could triple it and remain flat. We crowded no vehicle 
to the crest. But they moved aside and waved us through anyway -- full hand 
waves, we might add. 
</P>
<P>
The 348's brakes do not snag fiercely, like anchors, and power doesn't kick in 
like an afterburner. So whenever misjudgment lightens one end or corner of the 
car, gentle brushing of brakes or throttle downloads the Ferrari until it 
squats deep on all fours. 
</P>
<P>
The car is loyal, predictable, balanced and an absolute rocket on Velcro. Yet 
it can also be driven slowly and daily. It will not lug at low speeds in high 
gear or chug in freeway crawls. And the suspension will jiggle no love handles. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 348 much prefers to play hard, to be wound up tight through the 
gears to where it sings alto and looks around for some Mercedes or 300ZX to 
entice. Or to slide alongside a young gentleman on a yellow-and-chrome 
Harley-Davidson who grins because he also knows the marrow of things 
mechanical. 
</P>
<P>
But enough of such rhapsodizing. 
</P>
<P>
The Ferrari 348 has trunk space so minimal, so misshapen it can only be used 
fully by factory-supplied fitted luggage. Minor repair bills are usually 
four-figure affairs. Antilock brakes are standard but an air bag isn't even an 
option. The Ferrari's Roman nose is about 5 inches off the ground, so even 
gentle driveways create much grazing of the car's chin and greater gritting of 
the owner's teeth. 
</P>
<P>
It is expensive, impractical as a commuter car, arrogant down to its $1,300 
gas-guzzler tax and most certainly is a 170-m.p.h. anachronism in a 65-m.p.h. 
society. So arrogant, in fact, the company is delivering new 348s with 1989 
construction dates to avoid compliance with U.S. passive restraint requirements 
for 1990 models. 
</P>
<P>
But Ferrari will make 4,000 cars this year and has presold each one. The 4,500 
Ferraris that will be built next year already have customers. Vandagriff says 
even he really doesn't fully understand the addiction. But he has seen the 
worst of the lust at work. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers a Northern California customer, a woman, who in the '50s ordered a 
Ferrari 375 Mille Miglia. She wanted a scarlet Ferrari with cappuccino-tan 
interior and, obviously, left-hand drive. 
</P>
<P>
Enzo Ferrari -- a born chauvinist who believed a woman's place was making pasta 
and driving Fiats but never a Ferrari -- handled the order personally. He 
shipped the woman a right-hand-drive car. It was yellow with green seats and 
brown carpets. 
</P>
<P>
Remembers Vandagriff: "The car arrived, the woman took one look at it, said, 
'Thank you very much,' and accepted it on the spot."

DOMESTIC ISSUES; 
</P>
<P>
MEN HELP MORE AT HOME, BUT IT'S STILL WOMEN'S WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA FRENKIEL, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Men talk about it. Women do it. 
</P>
<P>
Housework: It may rank up there with sex and money as one of the most divisive 
issues in relationships between men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are most women -- whether they are traditional stay-at-home types or 
hard-driving executives -- have a few complaints about the division of labor at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
And although studies show that men are doing far more than their fathers ever 
did -- as much as a third of the housework -- women still shoulder most of the 
responsibility for keeping the home clean. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 readers responded to the Baltimore Sun's recent readers' poll 
asking who does the housework. Of these, a handful of men claimed to be "Mr. 
Clean" around the house, a dozen couples responded with their housework stories 
and a few singles complained about having no help. 
</P>
<P>
But the vast majority of letters came from women, either detailing elaborate 
arrangements for sharing the dirty work or telling us how they do it all alone. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Porter, 39, a mother of three, sent a simple response to the question, 
"Who does the work around your house?" 
</P>
<P>
"I do!" she scrawled on a sheet of red paper. 
</P>
<P>
The survey -- although unscientific -- nonetheless brought responses that 
mirror those of major national surveys. They corresponded with the findings of 
Arlie Hochschild, author of "The Second Shift," a 1989 book that says women 
work one shift at the office, then a second one at home. If you add up the time 
women spend each week on household jobs, it would total 15 hours more than men, 
Hochschild concluded. 
</P>
<P>
In her eight-year study of 52 couples, the professor at the UC Berkeley found 
this breakdown: 20% of men share housework equally with their partners; 70% do 
less than half but more than a third, and 10% do less than a third. 
</P>
<P>
This unequal division of labor, Hochschild found, leads to resentments, 
bitterness and sometimes even failed marriages. 
</P>
<P>
The letters to The Sun came from a cross-section of couples, including pairs in 
which both partners work and those where one stays at home. A few couples wrote 
that they hire cleaners, but the majority do their own housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the older the woman and the longer the duration of the marriage, the 
more likely it is that the woman handles most of the work, although a few women 
noted that their husbands became more likely to help out after retiring. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the younger married couples said they had strived for more equitable 
divisions of chores but discovered it wasn't always practical. According to 
Hochschild and other researchers, household jobs still tend to be divided up by 
stereotypical gender roles. Women usually do the routine tasks inside the home 
-- cleaning and cooking and laundry -- while men do the maintenance inside and 
outside the house, including lawn care and car repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still traditional tasks that defy change," wrote Carolyn Williams, 
32, a data processing training manager. "My husband won't sew on a button and I 
don't get near the garbage." 
</P>
<P>
Sociologist Janet Hunt describes the difference in terms of perception. "Men do 
the more visible things," said the University of Maryland, College Park 
sociologist. "For instance, they like to cook when company comes, but not 
daily. . . . Women tend to do more of the invisible things." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the continued inequality, men are doing more at home than before. A 
December, 1989, survey by Men's Health magazine found that men now do three 
hours of housework per week compared to 1.1 hours per week in the 1960s. But to 
many women, it still isn't enough. And so begins an escalating pattern of anger 
and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a woman married to a man who's doing more work around the house than 
his father did, he thinks you've got a great deal, so why are you complaining?" 
said Geoffrey Greif, associate professor at the University of Maryland School 
of Social Work. But "the wife resents the fact he's doing more but still not 
all the work she is." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there are some families where the work is shared easily. 
</P>
<P>
At the Dorman residence they try to keep a sense of humor about housework. 
Everyone has assigned tasks, plus they follow a simple rule: "You mess it, you 
clean it." 
</P>
<P>
Erika, 15, does her own laundry, sweeps the floors and vacuums the steps. 
Stephanie, 11, must vacuum the communal areas, collect trash and dust the 
furniture. Darlene Dorman, a credit manager, explained her role: "I take care 
of our bedroom while my husband, Wayne, takes care of the family room, which is 
where he spends most of his time anyway, in the 'prone' position, i.e. asleep 
on the sofa, TV on, remote clenched in hand." 
</P>
<P>
Dorman, a letter carrier, does not dispute that version. "My wife does most of 
the work around the house," he admitted. "I only do about 10% of the work." 
</P>
<P>
"Our house isn't spotless," Darlene Dorman said. "It would never make House 
&amp; Garden, but we are comfortable and happy and this arrangement works for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
At the Smero home everyone keeps to a tight schedule. Michael Smero leaves 
early every morning for his job as a steelworker, while his wife Wendy prepares 
their son for day care. She works at her family's bridal shop six or seven days 
a week, often until 10 p.m., so he picks up their son from day care, then 
shops, cooks, cleans and does laundry. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Smero praised her husband. "Not many men would do this," she said, 
estimating that Smero takes care of 75% of the household chores. "He's a clean 
fanatic. When I come home, and I'm tired and dropping clothes on the floor, 
he's right behind me, picking everything up." 
</P>
<P>
Smero explained: "Sometimes I catch myself complaining about the volume of 
housework that I do. Who doesn't? But I know that eventually, we'll reap the 
benefits of my wife's business if it continues growing at the rate it is."

YOUNGER WRITERS FOCUS ON THE 'OTHER' HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIKKI FINKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She's the queen bee, the 800-pound gorilla, or whatever else you want to call 
her. But, most importantly, she sells books by the millions. And every aspiring 
Hollywood trash novelist wants to turn out bestsellers just like Jackie 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Or do they? 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble with Jackie is that she skips a whole, real, young Hollywood 
generation," declares movie producer and "Dirty Dreams" co-author Lynda Obst. 
</P>
<P>
"She's writing about people who are very different from the people I know. 
While I'm struggling to get deals made and romances going, her characters are 
frequenting Giorgio's and Chasen's. Her women have a completely different 
lifestyle and set of problems than the women in our generation." 
</P>
<P>
That's why Obst and screenwriter Carol Wolper claim they are the new 
spokespeople for a young Hollywood that, in their eyes, Collins ignores. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, they write about the career-ladder-climbing junior executives 
at the studios, not the already-arrived studio moguls. They write about 
struggling Hollywood secretaries instead of shop-till-they-drop Hollywood 
wives. They write about Melrose clothing shops and downtown underground clubs, 
not Rodeo Drive and the Bistro Garden. 
</P>
<P>
But tell that to Collins and her eyes glaze over. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of luck to them. The easier you make it look, the more they think they 
can do it," says the Beverly Hills author whose 13th book about the Hollywood 
scene, "Lady Boss," hits bookstores this October, timed to coincide with a NBC 
miniseries based on her previous works, "Chances" and "Lucky." 
</P>
<P>
All this sniping stems from the big bucks that are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Hollywood trash novels sell, and sell big, when they're 
handled by masters and mistresses like Collins, Judith Krantz, Sidney Sheldon 
and Danielle Steel. 
</P>
<P>
Steel, a Delacorte author, has average hardcover sales of 1.1 million per book, 
according to the New York Times, while Sheldon, a William Morrow author, is 
also on top with 850,000. Close behind is Judith Krantz, a Crown writer, at 
500,000, followed by Simon &amp; Schuster's Collins with 475,000. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Collins' hugely successful 1983 novel, "Hollywood Wives," topped 
the New York Times bestseller list for 30 weeks, sold 5 million hardcover and 
paperback copies and wound up as a TV miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
But it's precisely because Collins has been crowding bookshelves for so long 
that publishers are beginning to think some new and younger writers aping her 
style may be able to attract new and younger readers. 
</P>
<P>
"I especially liked the young sensibility in 'Dirty Dreams.' It was new 
territory, and a different view of Hollywood than Collins'," explains Michaela 
Hamilton, editorial director of mass market publishing at NAL-Dutton, which 
bought the Obst-Wolper book. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not hard to find Hollywood novels, but it is hard to find ones that make 
it seem fresh and exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Stumpf, vice president and senior editor at William Morrow, says his 
publishing house bought Linda Lane's and Nancy Lee Andrew's "Malibu 90265" 
because "everybody is looking for another Jackie Collins or Danielle Steel. 
Why? Because they sell." 
</P>
<P>
But finding an author who can do it as well is a real challenge, Stumpf notes. 
"There are not a lot of people out there doing it because not a lot of people 
know how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Booth, who penned last year's "Beverly Hills" and came out with "Malibu" 
this summer, is probably the most successful writer so far to focus on the 
"other" Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Jackie's shop-till-you-drop, broad-shoulder-pads-on-Rodeo-Drive 
concept is complete passe," Booth maintains. "In fact, I think she'll be 
selling less books because she is reflecting something that was five years ago, 
not something that is now. And I think my readership will pick up because all 
of a sudden people are realizing I'm out there writing about this other 
Hollywood. I think my books are very much for the young at heart." 
</P>
<P>
Counters Collins: 
</P>
<P>
"All this 'new' Hollywood and 'old' Hollywood really doesn't exist. It just 
exists in people's minds. What these people make the mistake of doing is they 
write what they think is the new, hip Hollywood but it's only hip and it's only 
young for a short while. And then it moves on to something else. 
</P>
<P>
"So if you try to put yourself into a category, you're doing yourself a 
disservice. I don't write about any particular type of Hollywood. I just write 
about what I see out there, and I see it out there all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Collins can't be doing too much wrong. Just ask the authors of "Malibu 
90265" who their favorite author is, and they answer in unison: "Jackie 
Collins."

<P>
This small (population 6,248) port city in Southern France has a definite 
fashion look this summer. Clothes are short, tight and sexy. 
</P>
<P>
Dresses in floral prints, cyclist shorts in polka-dots and anything else that 
stretches and snuggles up to a body is the right idea for the city streets. 
</P>
<P>
Out at the beach there are more one-piece swimsuits than ever, which do double 
duty back in town as body suits under leggings or bike shorts. 
</P>
<P>
The glamour touch is metallic shoes and handbags: gold leather ballerinas and 
huge gold totes or quilted shoulder bags, even with the most pared-down 
sportswear looks. 
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of famous fashion faces around town. Italian designer 
Valentino's low-to-the-water, navy blue yacht, Blue One, inches into port with 
Valentino's partner, Giancarlo Giammetti, anxiously surveying the maneuvers. 
Giammetti wears a blue-and-white-striped robe while Valentino lounges on the 
top deck in a yellow Shetland and white trousers during the stressful 
procedure. Meanwhile, Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos is dropping 
anchor in the open water facing the port -- his yacht is too big for the port 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Portside fashion here often resembles a parade of bad taste, but this season 
there's a fanciful look centered around cropped-at-the-knee floral overalls, 
white T-shirts and white tennis shoes. Or there's an ultra-sexy summer look 
with stretch leggings in brilliant prints or bike shorts revealing more body 
than the shortest shorts or minis. PATRICIA McCOLL

VAN GOGH SALE WILL BENEFIT MUSEUM FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Vase With Daisies and Poppies," a Vincent van Gogh still life assumed to have 
been painted in 1890 during the last weeks of the artist's life, will be 
auctioned Nov. 14 by Christie's, New York. 
</P>
<P>
The painting, which depicts poppies, blue cornflowers and daisies casually 
displayed is a vase that is sitting on a pinkish-white tabletop, is expected to 
bring in $12 million to $16 million, according to Christie's officials. 
</P>
<P>
The painting was a partial gift to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery from George F. 
Goodyear in 1962. Sixty-five percent of proceeds from the sale will benefit the 
gallery's acquisition fund, and will be used to further strengthen its holdings 
in modern and contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is especially known for its concentration of modern and postwar art 
from all over the world, particularly in contemporary American art. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining proceeds, 28% will go to the Buffalo Museum of Science and 7% 
will go to the University at Buffalo Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The work may have been painted at the home of the artist's patron, Dr. Gachet, 
Christie's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A letter from Van Gogh to his brother Theo, dated June 17, 1990, described two 
studies of wildflowers. Another letter, dated June 3 of the same year, stated 
that Gachet's home was "full like an antique dealer's" and that "there is 
always something for arranging flowers in or for a still life." 
</P>
<P>
Art experts said it is possible that "Vase With Daisies and Poppies" was 
painted at Gachet's house, with flowers from his garden arranged in a vase 
owned by the doctor. GREG BRAXTON

SATIN-TONED '50S CROONERS FIND A HOME; 
</P>
<P>
DOO-WOP: THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SOCIETY WILL HAVE A SHINDIG SUNDAY IN 
LAKEWOOD.

Where do old doo-wop singers go? 
</P>
<P>
That's not the set-up line to a joke, but the mission of Steve Propes. And 
Propes, founder and director of the Southern California Doo-Wop Society, 
believes there is no single answer. 
</P>
<P>
Dewey Terry, who had regional hits with the Pasadena-based Squires in the age 
of Eisenhower, made Little Richard-style rock in the '50s and worked with the 
English punk group Tupelo Chain Sex in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The story is quite different for Leon Peels, lead singer of Los Angeles' Blue 
Jays, who has spent the last 25 years in such jobs as fry cook at a Holiday 
Inn. 
</P>
<P>
But now their paths have crossed again, thanks to the Doo-Wop Society. 
</P>
<P>
"Leon got disheartened and left music in the '60s," said Propes, 47, who 
describes himself as a professional "free-lance record fan" with more than 
20,000 singles in his collection. "But with the help of the Doo-Wop Society 
he's performing regularly. He's getting the recognition he's deserved for 
20-plus years." 
</P>
<P>
How the society helped is a pretty simple matter. Propes mentioned Peels on the 
rock 'n' roll radio show he hosted on KLON-FM from 1980 through 1989. (He now 
does a version of the show on Simmons Cable television in Long Beach, Sundays 
from 9 a.m. to noon.) Soon he got a call from someone who put him in touch with 
the singer. 
</P>
<P>
An informal group of doo-wop lovers had already formed -- mainly students from 
a rock 'n' roll history class Propes taught at Cal State Long Beach in the 
mid-'80s. In early 1989 the group formally became the Doo-Wop Society in order 
to facilitate the rediscovery of old singers and provide a setting for them to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
"We just put out the word and see what comes back," Propes said. "Then we 
actively try to re-create the groups as much as possible and get the original 
sound and feel." 
</P>
<P>
Both Peels and Dewey will be among the performers at the Doo-Wop Society's 
quarterly meeting/concert Sunday at the Hop in Lakewood. The event will also 
include the first performance in 30 years by Shirley Gunter &amp; the Queens 
(the first female doo-wop group) and Richard Berry, who will be awarded a 
special gold record for writing the rock classic "Louie Louie." Berry will 
re-create the music of his original doo-wop group, the Flairs. 
</P>
<P>
"They found me," Dewey Terry said. "It's good for people like Shirley Gunter 
and others who have not had a chance to get back on stage. After you've been 
out of it so long, people tend to forget you." 
</P>
<P>
Another group on the bill is the Storytellers, which Propes takes credit for 
reuniting after more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"They were four Chicanos from the San Gabriel Valley area who got together in 
the late '50s and had a deal with a small record company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They had one record under their name which is now a major-league collector's 
item, but at the time they had no luck with the record and stopped. I played 
the record on my radio show and got a call from one of them. As a result, they 
got back together. Now they've released a record on Classic Artists Records, a 
new doo-wop label -- believe it or not, there are some. . . . That was the 
power of doo-wop on the air." 
</P>
<P>
Both Propes and Terry say that the Doo-Wop Society is not just an exercise in 
nostalgia. "We do something new with our music," said Terry of his act with 
longtime partner Don (Sugarcane) Harris. "Music is a process of evolution." 
</P>
<P>
And Propes noted that several groups performing Sunday are new acts that have 
added their own touches to the art form. Both Propes and Terry also pointed out 
cultural ties between doo-wop and rap music. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been a relationship," Terry said. "It's an old church thing -- 
you say something and there's a response. Rappers just put electronic drums on 
it. Those were old things that came out of black neighborhoods, which evolved 
into what rap is today." 
</P>
<P>
Propes even sees a possibility of the two forms being combined into a new 
hybrid, though he thinks it would take some work and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could have anything to do with combining the two cultures, we'd jump on 
it," he said. "But it would take someone more creative than the board members. 
I know my limits."

JAZZ NOTES: PHOTOGRAPHER PAULA ROSS KEEPS HER MUSICAL TASTES IN FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Photographer Paula Ross has had a lifelong love affair with jazz -- she heard 
it as a pre-teen at home and later was lucky enough to have seen greats like 
Billie Holiday. "It's always been my music," said the New Jersey native. 
</P>
<P>
When she moved to Southern California a few years ago, Ross, who has been a 
professional photographer for 15 years, began integrating her fascination with 
jazz and her work with the camera, shooting musical giants like Sonny Rollins, 
Horace Silver, Miles Davis and Benny Carter. 11 of her hand-colored portraits 
are currently hanging in the Grand Avenue Bar of the Biltmore Hotel. Ross will 
be honored at reception for the show on Thursday, 5 p.m., with saxman Plas 
Johnson providing the aural ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
Ross feels the key piece of the exhibit is a photograph of the late singer 
Sarah Vaughan, whom Ross photographed at the Blue Note jazz club in New York 
City in October, 1989. "Sarah didn't want anyone taking photos in private, so I 
held my camera in my lap and shot very discreetly from my seat in the audience, 
without a flash," said Ross. "I just prayed and shot, and I'm so glad I did." 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 612-1532. 
</P>
<P>
CLUB SCENE UPDATE: Drummer/singer Bob Marks decided he wanted his own place to 
play, so he enlarged the waiting area of his Legends of Hollywood delicatessen 
(6555 Hollywood Boulevard, (213) 464-7780), installed a piano and called 
musicians and, about a month ago, started having sessions. "The response has 
been fantastic, both from musicians and the audience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marks has instigated a three-night-a-week policy at his establishment, with 
saxman Jay Migliori on tap Fridays and Sundays (Sunday invited guests are on 
hand), and reedman Ray Pizzi on Saturday. Both men play with Marks' quartet, 
featuring bassist Jim Garafalo, among others and a variety of pianists. 
Showtime is 9 p.m., and there's no cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
Another trapsman, the great Billy Higgins, is spotlighting music more than 
occasionally at his World Stage (4344 Degnan Blvd., Leimert Park, (213) 
293-2451). The 60-seat performance space -- "We've got a bandstand and a front 
door," Higgins laughed, "but it's nice" -- is not just for musicians, "but for 
all kinds of artists," said the owner. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight and Saturday at World Stage, the B Sharp Jazz Quartet, featuring 
drummer Herb Graham, Jr. and saxman Randall Willis is offering original 
contemporary jazz material. Downbeat: 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
ENCORE O'DAY: Anita O'Day, the renowned jazz chanteuse who appears at the Vine 
Street Bar &amp; Grill tonight and Saturday, was chosen as one of Esquire 
Magazine's "Women We Love" and was honored Thursday at a banquet at the Beverly 
Hills Hotel, hosted by NYC columnist Liz Smith. O'Day and Esquire go back a few 
years: she won the "Best New Female Jazz Vocalist" award in the 1945 Esquire 
Jazz Poll.

A LONG SHOT, 66 FOR ALLEN; 
</P>
<P>
BRITISH OPEN: AN UNHERALDED AMERICAN MAKES MONSTER PUTT FOR A BIRDIE, SHARES 
THE LEAD WITH NORMAN. 
</P>

ST. ANDREWS, Scotland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The largest green on the Old Course of the Royal and Ancient covers 5,555 
square yards, more than an acre. It takes two men 1 1/2 hours to mow it and 
they cover 3 1/2 miles each. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Allen used all of it Thursday to sink a putt of "at least 100, maybe 
150 feet" that helped him shoot a six-under-par 66 and share the first-round 
lead of the 119th British Open with favorite Greg Norman of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Allen was on the 13th hole, but he was nearer the cup on the fifth hole when he 
made his birdie putt across one of St. Andrews' legendary double greens. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit it as hard as I could," Allen said. "It broke a little from left to 
right, bounced up in the air about a foot and disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Jacobsen, who was putting on the fifth hole at the time, stopped and 
bowed in the direction of Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter was bowing, and I was thanking the gods," Allen said. "It was not only 
the longest putt I ever made, it was the longest I ever saw. I've never even 
made a chip shot as long as that." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Jacobsen was also at six under par before he knocked a chip 
shot into the terrifying Road bunker that guards the 17th green and made a 
double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
That left Allen and Norman in front, followed by British favorite Nick Faldo at 
67 and an international group of eight -- Jacobsen and Payne Stewart of the 
United States; Christy O'Connor Jr. of Ireland; Ian Woosnam of Wales; Ian 
Baker-Finch and Craig Parry of Australia; Martin Poxon of England and Sam 
Torrance of Scotland -- at 68. 
</P>
<P>
Hundred-foot putts were not for everyone, however. Craig Stadler was that far 
away on the sixth green, which shares its surface with No. 12, and took five 
putts, including a one-inch whiff. Stadler finished with an 82, the day's high 
score he shared with Rodger Davis of Australia and Graham Farr of Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
"The best shot I hit all day went in the water (at Swilcan Burn) on the first 
hole," Stadler said. "That sort of set the pace for the front nine." The former 
Masters champion rallied from a 48 to a 34 on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
On a day so warm and bright that scantily clad sunbathers on the sands of St. 
Andrews Bay were at times more entertaining than the golf, par 72 was no match 
for the world's finest golfers on the world's oldest course. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty players bettered par, and another 30 equaled it in the lowest-scoring 
orgy in British Open history. Only an afternoon wind, which pestered late 
starters and drove sun-worshipers off the sand, kept the number of par-breakers 
from soaring higher as conditions were otherwise perfect for scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Low scores are not unusual for Allen, 31, a former mountain climber who studied 
horticulture at Nevada Reno before taking up golf. Followers of the Los Angeles 
Open will remember Allen as the player who ripped Riviera Country Club with an 
opening-round, eight-under-par 63 in February before finishing 12th. He also 
had a final-round 63 to win the Scottish Open last year at the famed Gleneagles 
course in Perthshire. 
</P>
<P>
That round had some spectacular moments, too. In one stretch, Allen chipped in 
from 18 feet, holed a 40-foot bunker shot and chipped in a second time. 
</P>
<P>
"When my caddy handed me my putter on the next hole, I'd forgotten what it was 
for," Allen recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The victory in the Scottish Open encouraged Allen to try the American PGA Tour 
again, after three earlier failures. In 18 tournaments this year, he has made 
the cut in 11 to earn $74,397 and rank 114th on the money list. His highest 
finish was in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be back in Europe on a links course," he said. "In the States, 
the courses are different. They are so exact and penal unless you hit the 
perfect shot. It's been a long, hard grind for me over there (in the United 
States), but if you want to make it to the top in golf, that's the place to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who had seven birdies before making a bogey on the final hole with three 
putts from 40 feet, is not the only athlete in his family. His father, Charles, 
played at Wimbledon in 1946, losing to Chris Evert's father, 16-14, 6-0, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 17th, the Road Hole, was the most pivotal all day, the 18th, a 
straightaway 354 yards with no bunkers, produced its share of excitement, too. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, two-time winner of the Masters and the 1987 British Open champion, 
eagled it to take sole possession of third place, and Norman, the 1986 British 
Open winner, almost drove the green and made a birdie to pull level with Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"The eagle at 18 made my day, for sure," Faldo said. "I hit a two-wood off the 
tee so I would have a fuller second shot to the green, but the ball took off 
and rolled too close to the green. I had to hit a shot I didn't want, a pitch 
and run, and I got the break right. First, it went right to left, and then 
swung left to right. It was a real bonus for it to go in." 
</P>
<P>
Faldo said he rarely uses a two-wood but put it in his bag especially for this 
course, calling it "a good links-course club." He used it off the tee five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Norman used his driver and hit the ball almost flag high, off the edge of the 
green but in a fluffy lie. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to chip it with a five- or seven-iron and let it swing through the 
Valley of Sin," Norman said, "but with the lie I had, I had to use my putter 
and try and knock it as close as I could, which wasn't very close. But I made 
the (16-foot) putt, and that's all that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
"I played a pretty solid round of golf, six birdies and no bogeys, and that's a 
good way to start off a tournament, especially in a major. It's nice to come 
from behind on the last day, but it's better when you start out good and don't 
have to put so much pressure on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The 461-yard 17th, the hole Seve Ballesteros and others call "the most 
difficult par-four in golf," played up to its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros himself, who won the tournament there in 1984 with a par to Tom 
Watson's bogey five, had a double bogey on 17 to wind up at 71. He pulled his 
second shot far to the left, from where he wedged over a bunker, but the ball 
caught the downslope and rolled to the back of the green into three-putt 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
Parry and Jacobsen also made double bogeys on No. 17 that knocked them out of a 
share of the lead, and Faldo's bogey had the same result for him. 
</P>
<P>
Poxon, on the other side of the coin, hit a five-iron for his second shot that 
rolled four feet from the hole to set up a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
"It was better than sex, that five-iron," Poxon said. 
</P>

ROSE GETS FIVE MONTHS IN PRISON; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FINE, SUPERVISED RELEASE, COMMUNITY SERVICE INCLUDED IN PUNISHMENT 
AFTER HE PLEADS GUILTY TO TWO COUNTS OF FILING FALSE INCOME TAX RETURNS. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He collected a record 4,256 major league hits against Tom Seaver, Steve 
Carlton, Bob Gibson, Don Drysdale, Nolan Ryan and others, but this was 
different, this was something more serious. 
</P>
<P>
This was the United States of America against Peter Edward Rose on a distinctly 
different playing field. 
</P>
<P>
This was Courtroom 4 of the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in downtown 
Cincinnati, a few blocks from Pete Rose Way and Riverfront Stadium, where Rose 
once played and managed. 
</P>
<P>
This was case number CR 190-044, Judge S. Arthur Spiegel presiding. And this 
was Thursday morning, when Rose, having pleaded guilty to two felony counts of 
filing false income tax returns, was sentenced by Spiegel to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Five months in a federal correctional camp at Ashland, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One year of supervised release, during which he must (1) spend the first 
three months in a Cincinnati halfway house or community treatment center, and 
(2) provide 1,000 hours of community service -- a minimum of 20 hours a week -- 
at specified inner-city schools and a recreational center here. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who was also fined $50,000, showed no emotion as Spiegel read the 
sentence. Rose was accompanied by his wife, Carol, and a battery of lawyers as 
he left the court. 
</P>
<P>
His publicist, Barbara Pinzka, said Rose would not appear on his radio talk 
show here Thursday night and would have no comment aside from a statement that 
she distributed. 
</P>
<P>
"I accept my punishment and have no plans to appeal," Rose said in the 
statement. "I will serve my sentence, pay my debt to society and get on with my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Rose must report to the minimum-security facility, about a two-hour drive from 
Cincinnati, on Aug. 10, providing he has recovered from arthroscopic surgery on 
his right knee today. Rose, 49, tore cartilage in the knee during a family 
stickball game Sunday but walked without the need of crutches Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement delivered in a cracking voice, Rose told Spiegel that he 
was filled with sorrow and shame, and that, while perceived as arrogant and 
aggressive, "I want people to know that I do have emotion, I do have feelings 
and I can be hurt like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "And I hope no one has to go through what I went through the last 
year and a half. I lost my dignity, I lost my self-respect, I lost a lot of 
dear fans and I almost lost some very dear friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my wife for her moral support 
during this ordeal. It had to be very tough on her when your 5-year-old son 
(Tyler) would come home from school and tell her that his daddy is a jailbird." 
</P>
<P>
Rose added that he had no excuse, that the problems of the last year and a half 
were "all my fault. And all I can say is, I hope somewhere, somehow in the 
future, I'm going to try to make it up to everybody that I disappointed and let 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Rose has said that his tax problems stemmed from a gambling addiction that also 
resulted in an investigation by the baseball commissioner's office last summer 
and, ultimately, a lifetime suspension from baseball for betting on the Reds 
and other teams. The action also cost him his position as manager of his 
hometown team and clouded his candidacy for the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
He has been receiving treatment by telephone for the addiction from Dr. James 
Hillard, head of the psychiatry department at the University of Cincinnati 
College of Medicine, and can apply to baseball for reinstatement on Aug. 24. 
But Thursday's sentencing is likely to delay that application. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to avoid a grand jury indictment, Rose pleaded guilty on April 20 
to the two counts of failing to report $354,968 in income from memorabilia 
sales, personal appearances and gambling winnings from 1984 through '87, a 
period during which he paid more than $2 million in taxes on reported income of 
$4.6 million. He has since paid $366,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties 
for that period. 
</P>
<P>
He could have been sentenced to three years in prison and fined $250,000 on 
each count, but Spiegel said he would not "penalize Rose twice for the same 
activity" and that his sentence was consistent with sentencing guidelines 
enacted before the years covered by the second count. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel said he was seeing two people: "Pete Rose the living legend, the 
all-time hit leader and the idol of millions; and Pete Rose the individual, who 
appears today having been convicted of two counts of cheating on his taxes." 
</P>
<P>
And Thursday, Spiegel said, he was not dealing with the legend, not concerned 
whether Rose was treated fairly by the commissioner, whether he gambled on 
baseball or should have been banished. 
</P>
<P>
"History and the tincture of time will decide his place among the all-time 
greats," Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
"With regard to Pete Rose, the individual, he has broken the law, admitted his 
guilt and stands ready to pay the penalty. . . . I have concluded that Mr. Rose 
must serve some time in a prison setting for his crime in order to maintain 
respect for the law and as a deterrent to others who might consider cheating on 
their taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel added that he thought his ruling balanced the temptation to go heavy on 
a well-known figure with the temptation to go light because of Rose's financial 
and career suffering of the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. U.S. attorney William Hunt seemed to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I had hoped that Mr. Rose would be treated like any other citizen who comes 
before the court and I think he was," Hunt said. "I don't want to comment on 
the appropriateness of the specific sentence, but I wanted one that fell within 
statutory guidelines, and that's what this sentence does." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt added that the sentencing procedure is the toughest part of any 
prosecutor's job in that "it is always saddening to see real people face real 
consequences. I have always tried my best to dissociate personal feelings and 
emotions with the judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Was that possible with Rose? 
</P>
<P>
"That's kind of a hard question to answer," Hunt said. "I haven't watched most 
defendants play ball at Crosley Field and Riverfront Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
At Riverfront, where the Reds were preparing to face the Philadelphia Phillies, 
many players seemed hesitant to talk about the sentencing, as if it would 
regenerate the disruptive atmosphere of last summer and interfere with their 
current role as the National League West leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is personal," veteran Ken Griffey Sr. said. "Pete knows how I 
feel, and that's enough. I don't want to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Rick Mahler said he didn't know what to expect but thought the episode 
shows how players are similar to everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our problems, and they're just as major and minor as those of the 
people who watch us," Mahler said. "Sure, you don't like to see it happen to 
anyone, but knowing Pete, he's probably relieved. He knows what he has to face 
now. He can get it over with and go on with his life." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Lou Piniella expressed a similar theme: "I feel bad for Pete, but in a 
way, I'm sure he must be glad it's out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, you don't like to see it happen to anyone, especially someone in 
our profession who has given so much to the game, but once he's through it, he 
can get his life back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
His life? Spiegel said he hopes it will always include the community service 
involvement prescribed in his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"The sentence will also require Mr. Rose to return to his roots in the inner 
city . . . in order to help children there make something of themselves and to 
encourage them to work to succeed in their goals with the same determination 
and dedication he did in his own life," Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
"We particularly want him to show these children that in spite of the mistakes 
he has made, he can learn and profit from them and become a more humble and 
better person from the experience. . . . The children with whom Mr. Rose will 
be working need a role model with whom they can identify in order to make the 
most of their chances in life. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Rose can provide the necessary inspiration, if he is the person I think 
he is."

LEMOND'S SHADOW IS STILL 5 SECONDS AHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
CYCLING: CHIAPPUCCI MIRRORS MOVES OF HIS RIVAL IN MAINTAINING HIS LEAD IN THE 
TOUR DE FRANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BORDEAUX, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg LeMond has been calling Claudio Chiappucci, his chief rival in this year's 
Tour de France, "Cappuccino." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond knows the difference between Italian coffee and Italian bicycle racers, 
so the malaprop is intended to tweak his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Chiappucci is not responding. Nor is he capitulating. He says LeMond must 
perform perfectly in Saturday's telling time trial to win his third Tour de 
France. 
</P>
<P>
The give-and-take between the Tour leaders was about all the drama there was in 
Thursday's 18th stage as cyclists descended the Pyrenees at Pau to the 
vineyards of Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
The verbal digs are just about all that separate LeMond and Chiappucci, who 
retained his five-second lead in the 124-mile stage. 
</P>
<P>
After two demanding stages in the Pyrenees, the leaders were content to relax 
on a scorching day in southern France. 
</P>
<P>
After the riders crossed the finish line near the Garonne River, they said the 
95-degree temperatures made it difficult to break away for any length of time. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a surge over Bordeaux's winding streets about two miles from the finish 
helped Eric Breukink of the Netherlands gain a nine-second lead over Pedro 
Delgado of Spain in the race for third place overall, 3:31 behind Chiappucci. 
Gianni Bugno of Italy won the stage in 5 hours 41 minutes 33 seconds. Breukink 
was one second behind and well ahead of the peloton -- the group of riders who 
cluster for much of each day. 
</P>
<P>
In the chess game for first place, LeMond could not rid himself of Chiappucci 
when the peloton broke apart. LeMond is considered an excellent strategist who 
turns the slightest opportunity into a big advantage. But Chiappucci shadowed 
his every move. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond could be seen searching the peloton for the leader's yellow jersey worn 
by Chiappucci. For most of the stage, he did not need to look past his back 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do everything I can to widen the gap today," Chiappucci said, referring 
to the 19th stage from Castillon to Limoges. "My chances are 50-50. Greg has to 
be in excellent shape, or I will keep the yellow jersey to Paris." 
</P>
<P>
Chiappucci, from Varese, near the Swiss border, is competing in only his second 
Tour de France. Yet, he is exuding the kind of confidence usually reserved for 
the LeMonds of the world. 
</P>
<P>
At least, this is the overriding sentiment of the media entourage covering the 
world's most prestigious bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
"LeMond is in great shape; no one will be able to beat him," said Luuk Blyboom, 
a Dutch journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but Chiappucci is making the chase fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, when a flat tire deflated LeMond's momentum in the Pyrenees, 
Chiappucci and his Carrera teammates did the unthinkable -- they attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Such tactics are considered unsportsmanlike. And in France, etiquette is 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
If a challenger has a technical failure, the unwritten rule of cycling says you 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
Chiappucci, sensing a huge opportunity, did not. Eventually, LeMond and his Z 
teammates caught Chiappucci to avert disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But LeMond implied that such disrespect could backfire, saying: "If Chiappucci 
wants to be unsportsmanlike, it could come back to haunt him." 
</P>
<P>
If Chiappucci is worried, he is not saying. 
</P>
<P>
He has been riding professionally for six seasons but did not win a race for 
four years. He was relegated to the role of domestique, or worker, for his 
team's best riders. In last year's Tour de France, Chiappucci worked for Urs 
Zimmermann, who now rides for 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
Chiappucci finished 81st last year, 1 hour 53 minutes 4 seconds behind LeMond, 
who edged Laurent Fignon in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1989 Tour, however, Chiappucci started improving rapidly. With 
Zimmermann struggling, Chiappucci was free to ride for himself. 
</P>
<P>
He won the Coppa Place one-day event in Italy a week after the Tour. Then he 
won the Tour de Piedmont in France last October. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Chiappucci finished 12th in the Giro d'Italia but was named that 
tour's best mountain rider. He also had an outstanding time trial, which has 
boosted his confidence for Saturday's showdown, a 27.9-mile race against the 
clock, preceding Sunday's finale into Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Today's 114-mile stage through the Dordogne region of southwest France is not 
expected to produce a dramatic change in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to conserve their energy for Saturday," Blyboom said.

GOODWILL II: WILL IT BE THE LAST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>

SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1986, the first Goodwill Games in the Soviet Union had one star. R.E. (Ted) 
Turner was creator, bankroller, broadcaster, promoter and philosopher. 
</P>
<P>
"Those aren't Communist dogs," he said one day while watching two strays cross 
a Moscow boulevard and making a point about equality among men. "Those are just 
dogs." 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing that Turner did not do was name the Games after himself, 
proving that, although his ego might be one of the world's largest, it rates no 
better than a silver medal against that of Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, the sequel, Goodwill Games II, opens today with so impressive 
a supporting cast that Turner no longer has to be the circus, just the 
ringmaster. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 2,500 athletes from 52 countries entered over the next 17 days 
in 21 sports, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. and its partners -- the Seattle 
Organizing Committee and the Soviet Union's Sports Committee -- have organized 
an event that, when compared to other international competitions, is surpassed 
in athletic excellence only by the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
As made-for-TV competition, these Games might even be more viewer-friendly than 
the Olympics because of their format. 
</P>
<P>
The organizers seeded at least one U.S. athlete and one Soviet athlete into 
each event and then filled the field by invitation with the six best athletes 
or teams available. 
</P>
<P>
In team events, medalists will be determined in tournaments. In individual 
events, all competitors advance to the finals, eliminating the possibility of a 
Carl Lewis fouling out of the long jump in the semifinals or a Matt Biondi 
cramping up in the first heat of the 100-meter butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi, who won seven swimming medals at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, is the 
featured performer today, when he attempts to reclaim the 50-meter freestyle 
record from Tom Jager at the King County Aquatics Center in Federal Way. They 
might be chasing East Germany's Nils Rudolph, who recently beat them both in 
Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Among other duels to watch over the next 17 days are Lewis against Leroy 
Burrell, also of the United States, in the 100 meters; Lewis against Robert 
Emmiyan of the Soviet Union in the long jump; swimmer Janet Evans against 
Astrid Strauss of East Germany and Julie McDonald of Australia in the 800-meter 
freestyle; Kurt Browning of Canada against Victor Petrenko of the Soviet Union 
and Christopher Bowman of the United States in men's figure skating; the United 
States against the Soviet Union in men's basketball, and the United States 
against Cuba and Japan in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet gymnasts, pairs skaters, ice dancers and ice hockey players; the 
Chinese divers; the Cuban boxers, and U.S. heptathlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee 
figure to be in classes by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
There have been some defections in recent days, particularly in track and 
field: 
</P>
<P>
 -- British miler Steve Cram, East German shotputter Ulf Timmermann and U.S. 
quarter-milers Butch Reynolds and Steve Lewis sent their regrets for one reason 
or another. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soviet officials will provide an update on pole vaulter Sergei Bubka's 
injured back when they find him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chinese women's basketball team withdrew Wednesday because of its poor 
performance this month in the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rex Lardner Jr., senior vice president and general manager of the 
Goodwill Games for TBS, said Thursday that 90% of the world's best athletes 
will compete in Seattle, Tacoma, Spokane and three other Washington cities. 
</P>
<P>
The TBS broadcast booth, however, will serve as the stage for some of the 
best-known athletes, including Dwight Stones, Rick Barry, Debi Thomas, Frank 
Shorter, Tracy Caulkins, John Naber, Karch Kiraly, Edwin Moses, Olga Korbut and 
Nadia Comaneci. The TBS super-station will televise 86 hours of the Games in 
the United States and reach 71 other countries with portions of its coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Another former athlete, President George Bush, had other commitments, but he 
sent his wife, Barbara, to speak Thursday to the Games' 10,000 volunteers, and 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, to represent him in Saturday's opening ceremony at Husky 
Stadium. Also scheduled to appear at the opening ceremony is former President 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
For those who are not interested in sports, the Goodwill Arts Festival includes 
performances by Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet, Montreal's Cirque de Soleil and 
Japan's Grand Kabuki Theatre. Turner, 51, did his part by bringing frequent 
companion Jane Fonda to a news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If Turner has maintained a lower profile in the organization of the Games than 
he did four years ago, one reason is that he has been busy creating a cartoon 
show that will have its premiere in September and is titled, "Captain Planet 
and the Planeteers." Princess Gaia, spirit of the Earth, recruits five children 
from different countries to help her combat those who have spoiled the planet. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, who is not too modest to compare his commitment to improving the world 
to that of Albert Einstein and Madame Curie, must have seen himself leading a 
similar crusade in 1985, when he formed the Better World Society. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, perplexed by U.S. and Soviet Summer Olympic boycotts in 1980 
and 1984, he arrived upon the idea of the Goodwill Games to bring together 
athletes from the two superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
With only 11 months to prepare for the inaugural Games in the summer of 1986, 
the competition in Moscow and the Estonian seaport of Talinn were, generally, 
not of the same caliber of that of this summer. 
</P>
<P>
There were, however, some exceptional performances. Joyner-Kersee set her first 
world record in the heptathlon, becoming the first person to exceed 7,000 
points. Ben Johnson ran 9.95 seconds to win the 100 meters, an event in which 
Lewis finished third. Another athlete who later would be disgraced because of a 
positive drug test, Angel Myers, won four gold medals and a bronze in swimming. 
Evans emerged on the international scene with two bronzes. A Cheryl Miller-led 
U.S. women's basketball team handed the Soviet Union its first loss against 
international competition in 152 games. 
</P>
<P>
But hardly anyone in the United States was paying attention. Turner suffered a 
ratings disaster that cost him an announced $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
He has promised his advertisers significantly better ratings this time, but 
network executive privately admit that the numbers will be only slightly 
better. If interest in Seattle is an indicator, they are probably right. 
Despite a massive public relations campaign, only a little more than half of a 
1.1 million tickets available have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said Thursday that his losses will be more than the $13 million that has 
been projected but less than the $65 million that ABC lost on its 1988 Winter 
Olympics coverage in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, he also expressed less than 100% optimism about the future 
of the Games, which are scheduled in 1994 for Moscow and Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, the losses we will have will be hopeful enough to 
keep going," he said. "We've got plans to go on, and we probably will." 
</P>
<P>
If this is the final Goodwill Games, that will not disappoint the International 
Olympic Committee. The U.S. Olympic Committee has made peace with Turner, but 
the IOC would rather the Goodwill Games not clutter the calendar in 1994, when 
Lillehammer, Norway, will stage the Winter Olympics. "Now that there is no more 
Cold War, there is no reason for the Goodwill Games," IOC President Juan 
Antonio Samaranch said earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Turner acknowledged that the Cold War has thawed, but he said there is still a 
place for the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same as with your wife or your girlfriend or your children," he said. 
"The relationship might be good now, but you still have to work at it to 
maintain that relationship."

INNER-CITY KIDS AWAIT ROSE AS ROLE MODEL 
</P>

<P>
They were in line at the LeBlond Boys/Girls Club Thursday, waiting for lunch -- 
giggling, seemingly carefree youngsters, momentarily forgetting and escaping 
the problems of the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Typical inner-city neighborhood," said Bob Wallace, the club's project 
director. "Low income. Lots of high-density projects. Considerable drug use and 
sale. High crime rate." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose will fulfill part of his community service obligation next year at 
LeBlond, during summer, when school is out. 
</P>
<P>
After pleading guilty to two counts of filing false income tax returns, Rose 
was sentenced Thursday to five months in a federal correctional institution, 
followed by a year of supervised release, including three months in a halfway 
house and 1,000 hours of community service at LeBlond and specified schools. 
</P>
<P>
Judge S. Arthur Spiegel, in his sentencing report, said Rose can be an 
inspiration and role model to the children of the inner city, that he can 
encourage them to succeed with the same dedication and determination he 
displayed and that he can demonstrate how to learn, profit and become a better 
person through mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete has a lot to offer, but he has to be frank and open regarding his 
mistakes," he said. "If you're phony, they don't care if you're Pete Rose. 
They'll just walk away. I mean, Pete can help these kids, and I think they can 
help Pete." 
</P>
<P>
LeBlond, which houses a gym, swimming pool, weight room, cafeteria, arts and 
crafts area and recreation room, has 1,200 members. Located in what are known 
as the West End and Over the Rhine areas of Cincinnati, it is only about 10 
miles from where Rose first achieved athletic prominence at Western Hills High 
School, but seems in another world contrasted with the estate Rose owns at 
Indian Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The kids, of course, are happy that this hometown hero is coming. They don't 
care from where, even if it's prison, which they think he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes they're not sure about, but gambling is wrong, a lot of them were saying 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Harris, an 11-year-old would-be pitcher and second baseman, was typical. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have known better," Harris said of Rose. "He should have known you 
have to follow the law. It don't make any sense. Why would he do the wrong 
thing when he was making all that money in baseball? Maybe he can tell us about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
That and more. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll probably show us how to hit home runs," Harris added, beaming at the 
thought.

RIPKEN GETS KEY HIT AND TIES ELSTER'S MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a night when he tied a major league record in the field, Cal Ripken carried 
the Baltimore Orioles to victory with his bat. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken matched Kevin Elster's record of 88 consecutive errorless games at 
shortstop and drove in two runs with a first-inning double as the Orioles beat 
the Chicago White Sox, 4-1, Thursday night at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken, who hasn't made an error since April 13, tied the record set by Elster, 
who went 88 games without an error with the New York Mets from July, 1988, to 
May, 1989. Ripken has handled 401 chances without an error, a major league 
record. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was only the second for Chicago in its last 14 road games. The White 
Sox, who fell two games behind the Oakland Athletics in the American League 
West, won six of their first seven games on an 11-day road trip. 
</P>
<P>
John Mitchell (2-2), who benefited from three double plays, allowed seven hits 
in 8 2/3 innings before being relieved by Gregg Olson, who retired Scott 
Fletcher to end the game for his 21st save. 
</P>
<P>
New York 2, Minnesota 1 -- Tim Leary snapped an eight-game losing streak and 
the Yankees scored their runs on a fifth-inning error by shortstop Greg Gagne 
at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Leary (4-12), who hadn't won since May 23 when he beat the Twins, 12-0, on a 
four-hitter in the Metrodome, gave up eight hits in 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up a run in the second, Leary blanked the Twins on five hits in 
the next 5 1/3 innings before being relieved by Greg Cadaret with runners at 
first and third with one out in the eighth. Cadaret got a double-play grounder 
before Dave Righetti pitched the ninth for New York, his 499th career 
appearance, and earned his 20th save in 22 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti moved past Hall of Famer Whitey Ford to first place on the Yankees' 
all-time list for pitching appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Smith (4-8) was the loser despite giving up five hits and one earned run in 
7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 1, Boston 0 -- Jeff Robinson pitched a two-hitter over eight innings 
and Larry Sheets' sixth-inning single scored Alan Trammell from first base with 
the only run for the Tigers at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson (7-7) lowered his earned run average from 5.67 to 5.25 with eight 
shutout innings. He out-pitched Greg Harris (7-4), who gave up eight hits and 
pitched his first complete game since 1982, his second in 61 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 4, Seattle 0 -- Mike Felder and Greg Vaughn hit first-inning home 
runs as the Brewers beat the Mariners at Milwaukee in a game that took nearly 
six hours to complete because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Krueger and Jamie Navarro combined on a seven-hitter. Krueger (5-5) 
stopped Seattle on three hits and two walks through five innings. Navarro 
allowed four hits over the final four innings to earn his first major league 
save.

New York's David Cone won his sixth consecutive decision and reached double 
figures in strikeouts for the fourth game in a row as the Mets beat the Atlanta 
Braves, 6-2, Thursday night at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have won 16 of 18 home games. 
</P>
<P>
Cone (7-4) gave up six hits, struck out 11 and walked three in 7 2/3 innings. 
He raised his season strikeout total to 117, third-best in the league, and has 
60 strikeouts in the last 54 innings. 
</P>
<P>
John Franco got the last four outs for his 20th save. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 5, Cincinnati 2 -- Darren Daulton drove in two runs and scored 
twice at Cincinnati as the Reds had their four-game winning streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Daulton hit a solo home run in the first inning, driving a curveball by Jack 
Armstrong over the right-field wall, and added a triple in the Phillies' 
two-run fifth inning and an eighth-inning single. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Combs (6-7) gave up 11 hits in seven-plus innings before Roger McDowell 
pitched the last two for his 14th save and first since June 2. 
</P>
<P>
Daulton's home run, his fourth of the year, was only the sixth off Armstrong in 
124 innings this year. Armstrong (11-5) went six innings, giving up seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 4, Montreal 3 -- Ken Caminiti's run-scoring single in the 11th inning 
gave the Astros a 7-0 record in extra-inning games at home this year. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Stubbs led off the 11th with a single off Bill Sampen (7-2). Stubbs 
then stole second base and came home when Caminiti followed with a single down 
the right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wallach started the Montreal 11th with a single and, after Mike Fitzgerald 
struck out, Larry Walker hit a line drive down the third-base line off Larry 
Andersen (5-2). But Caminiti made a diving catch for the second out, and Dave 
Martinez flied out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Astros' 16th in their last 21 home games. Overall, however, 
they have lost 18 of their last 30. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Galarraga, who hit a grand slam in the ninth inning of an 8-7, 11-inning 
loss to Cincinnati Wednesday night, homered off Jim Deshaies in the sixth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 8, San Diego 3 -- Todd Zeile and Terry Pendleton hit home runs and 
Joe Magrane turned in a solid pitching performance for six innings as the 
Cardinals won at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Zeile's home run, his team-leading 10th, made him the first St. Louis rookie to 
hit that many since Hector Cruz in 1976. Pendleton's homer, his sixth, was only 
the third by a Cardinal in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, who had scored only 14 runs in seven previous games, homered 
twice for the eighth time this year. They have 37 home runs in all, fewest in 
the majors, and have scored three or fewer runs 50 times. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hurst pitched four innings, yielding six hits, as the Padres lost their 
fourth game in a row. The Padres are 1-7 since Greg Riddoch took over as 
manager July 11.

All-Star outfielder Bobby Bonilla, unhappy with his wife's parking spot, 
angrily grabbed a Pittsburgh Pirates' vice president during a shouting match 
after the Pirates' 11-2 victory over San Francisco on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Upset because his wife and young daughter had to park in an unguarded lot about 
150 yards from the players' entrance at Three Rivers Stadium, Bonilla 
confronted vice president for public relations Rick Cerrone in the Pirates' 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Cerrone, who is not responsible for parking, waved Bonilla off. That angered 
Bonilla, who shouted at Cerrone and grabbed him by the tie as the two were 
shoved into the trainers' room. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bonilla nor Cerrone would talk about the incident. Cerrone, appearing 
upset, left the clubhouse after discussing the parking situation with player 
representative Jay Bell and Manager Jim Leyland. 
</P>
<P>
The players were given a new parking area earlier this season after complaining 
about a lack of security. As attendance has increased -- the Pirates are 
threatening to break the 2 million mark for the first time -- some players' 
wives have been unable to find spots in the new area. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be sure I will get this taken care of," Bell said.

NEWSWIRE: CLEVELAND STATE FIRES MACKEY AS COACH AFTER ARREST, DRUG TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cleveland State basketball Coach Kevin Mackey was fired Thursday, six days 
after his arrest for alleged drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, David Roth, said Mackey will soon begin treatment for drug and 
alcohol abuse at a center in Houston run by NBA player John Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey was arrested as he and a woman drove away from a reputed drug house. A 
urinalysis revealed that Mackey was drunk and had cocaine in his system, police 
said. Also arrested was Alma Massey, 36, who has a history of soliciting, 
according to police. 
</P>
<P>
"I just said that I fired Kevin Mackey, but really, he fired himself," 
university President John A. Flower said at a news conference. "It has become 
clear over the past few days that Kevin Mackey has, by his own admission, 
habitually and repeatedly made a mockery of standards of moral and ethical 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Mackey pleaded not guilty to driving while intoxicated, consumption of alcohol 
in a motor vehicle and violation of the open container ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey did not attend Thursday's news conference. On Tuesday, he said he has 
been living a double life, one as a family man and popular coach, the other as 
a man addicted to alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, he signed a new two-year contract with base salaries of $85,000 and 
$90,000. The contract has been voided, according to Jan Muczyk, senior vice 
president, although Muczyk said Mackey may be entitled to some payment. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin Mackey's contract did not have a morals clause in it, per se," Muczyk 
said. "Behavior that disgraces the university is adequate grounds for voiding a 
contract."

American jockey Steve Cauthen was fined $1,800 by the Jockey Club, the 
governing body of British horse racing, for withdrawing from a race at the last 
minute in May. 
</P>
<P>
Cauthen refused to ride a Pip Payne-trained colt, Nicholas Payne, at Leicester 
after he weighed out. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was fair of the trainer to book me for that particular 
horse," Cauthen said. "There is no doubt he was a difficult ride -- everybody 
backed me."

Cauthen can appeal the decision.

Former Pro Bowl running back Tony Collins, 31, signed a one-year contract with 
the Miami Dolphins, a few days after the NFL lifted his suspension for drug 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank Coach (Don) Shula for sticking his neck out for me, and I'm 
not going to cut it off," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said he has not used drugs for a year and a half. His worst binge came 
after the NFL ban when a cocaine overdose sent him to an Indianapolis hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Collins spent seven seasons with New England, rushing for 4,647 yards, catching 
passes for 2,356 yards and scoring 44 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Shula decided those numbers made the 184-pound Collins worth a gamble. Collins 
said at least five other teams rejected his request for a tryout.

Superior Court Judge David Yaffe rejected a bid today by a coalition of unions 
seeking to suspend a drug-testing program for Los Angeles County job applicants 
pending the outcome of a hearing on whether the unions should have a greater 
say in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning July 2, the county began requiring applicants to certain jobs to take 
the drug tests, including county employees seeking transfers. 
</P>
<P>
The job positions fell into three categories: those in public safety such as 
sheriff's deputies, lifeguards and ambulance drivers; equipment operators such 
as trash truck drivers, and those whose jobs carried large financial 
responsibilities such as lawyers and accountants.

The jury in Ray Buckey's second trial told the judge today it has reached a 
verdict on one of eight counts against the former teacher at the McMartin 
Pre-School. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg told the panelists to resume their talks, 
and the one verdict submitted in a sealed envelope was held in court custody 
until jurors resolve the remaining charges. 
</P>
<P>
The jury has been deliberating for two weeks and heard nearly three days of 
repetition of testimony earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey is charged with molesting three young girls who attended his family's 
nursery school in Manhattan Beach in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
He and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted of 52 molestation 
counts in an earlier trial. But the jury deadlocked on some of the charges 
against Buckey.

LEE ATWATER TAPS FRIEND AS GOP'S CHIEF SPOKESMAN

Republican Party Chairman Lee Atwater today named his best friend as chief 
spokesman for the party, saying the GOP needs a high-profile presence that he 
cannot provide while he is fighting a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
The new spokesman, Charles Black, is a partner in the political consulting firm 
Black, Manafort, Stone &amp; Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Since the discovery of Atwater's brain tumor in March, Black has been actively 
advising the Republican National Committee and President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
There have been increasing grumblings within the party, however, that with the 
clever and tenacious Atwater on the sidelines, the GOP has lost the offensive 
to the Democrats on issues such as taxes, the savings and loan disaster and 
civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater's chief of staff, Mary Matalin, has been handling day-to-day committee 
operations, and most party insiders have praised her operation. 
</P>
<P>
But some say that Matalin lacks the clout of Atwater and that White House Chief 
of Staff John H. Sununu has been making too many major political decisions 
without enough advice from others.

U.S., MISSOURI AGREE TO CLEAN UP DIOXIN IN EVACUATED GHOST TOWN

<P>
Federal and state environmental officials announced an agreement today that 
will finally clear the way for the cleanup of dioxin-contaminated Times Beach, 
which has been an untouched ghost town since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Morris Kay, regional director of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, 
announced the settlement with Syntex Corp., a company that made the dioxin, at 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Times Beach, about 20 miles southwest of St. Louis, made headlines seven years 
ago when health officials discovered that dioxin in waste oil had been sprayed 
on the town's streets. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government bought out the town -- 801 homes and businesses -- in 
1983 and began trying to figure out how to clean up the contaminated streets. 
</P>
<P>
Today's agreement calls for Syntex to incinerate the dioxin-contaminated soil 
from Times Beach and 27 other sites in eastern Missouri. Syntex will design and 
build the incinerator at Times Beach, and then tear it down and remove it when 
the cleanup is complete. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has said the entire cleanup of Times Beach and other Missouri sites 
will cost about $118 million and could take up to 10 years.

A defense lawyer urged a military tribunal today to free Nicu Ceausescu, saying 
the son of the executed Romanian dictator was ill and the strain of his trial 
on genocide charges was "destroying him." 
</P>
<P>
The appeal by defense lawyer Paula Jakob came shortly before the five-judge 
panel declared a monthlong recess in the trial, which resumed Monday after a 
break of several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"All these hours spent under the glare of TV lights are destroying him," Jakob 
said of Ceausescu, 39, who she says suffers from hepatitis and other disorders 
and may not survive his trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Please, sir, give Nicu a shore to land on, some place where he can come to 
rest. His only shore is you," Jakob said. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu is accused of ordering security forces to open fire on demonstrators 
in the city of Sibiu during the December revolution that toppled his father's 
hard-line government.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met today with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe 
Arens in the first high-level talks between the two countries since 
establishment of a hard-line Israeli government. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the State Department announced that Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III will meet Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in Washington on 
Aug. 9 or 10. 
</P>
<P>
The hasty meeting with Cheney, announced Thursday in Jerusalem and Washington, 
was set up shortly after Arens was named defense minister last month, a Defense 
Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon discussions and next month's meeting appeared to signal a slight 
warming of relations between the two countries, which have been strained since 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the rightist Likud bloc, balked at 
Baker's plan for a dialogue with Palestinians to prepare for Palestinian 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
While Cheney and Arens talked at a Pentagon lunch, State Department spokeswoman 
Margaret Tutwiler also faced questions about the postponement of a scheduled 
meeting of a joint committee that coordinates the nearly $2 billion in U.S. 
military aid to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler denied the move was a slap at Shamir's new government. 
</P>
<P>
"The postponement was an agreement between the United States government and the 
Israeli government. As you know, we are in the midst of a budget summit and 
there's a great deal of work associated with the summit negotiations," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of that, we've postponed the annual joint security assistant 
planning meeting and have mutually agreed with Israel to hold it in September 
to give us more time to prepare." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and Arens were not expected to discuss Middle East peace efforts, 
leaving that for Baker and Levy. The United States is still awaiting a 
definitive Israeli answer to its proposals to start a peace dialogue with 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon discussions are the first at the ministerial level between Israel 
and the United States since formation of a right-wing Israeli government in

Arens initiated his visit when Cheney contacted him to congratulate him on 
being named defense minister, a Pentagon spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"These talks are part of a longstanding series of discussions between the 
United States and Israeli defence secretaries, and with other friends, about a 
whole range of security issues," the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman denied that the Arens-Cheney meeting was in response to 
any specific situation, but did not rule out discussions of the Israeli-made, 
U.S.-funded Arrow missile.

The architect of US Sprint's successful bid for a share of a $25-billion 
federal contract has resigned, the company said today.

LONDON BOMB BLAST DOES SEVERE DAMAGE TO STOCK EXCHANGE

An explosion in a restroom caused extensive damage at the Stock Exchange today, 
40 minutes after a telephone warning of an Irish Republican Army bomb, police 
said. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
City of London police said the 23-story building in the heart of London's 
financial district was evacuated before the blast at 8:49 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion tore a hole about 20 feet high and seven feet wide in the modern 
concrete building, about 10 feet above ground level facing Old Broad Street. 
Glass and hunks of concrete littered the street. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Moore, commander of City of London Police, said warnings were telephoned 
to his department, the exchange and to Reuters news agency. George 
Churchill-Coleman, commander of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist unit, said there 
were eight warning calls in all. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb, which contained 5 to 10 pounds of high explosives, was in a men's 
restroom near the visitors' gallery, Churchill-Coleman said. Asked whether the 
IRA was responsible, he told reporters, "That's a reasonable assumption." 
</P>
<P>
Churchill-Coleman said the visitors' gallery had not opened at the time of the 
explosion. He said it is not known when the device was planted. 
</P>
<P>
"People would have been killed if they had been in the building at the time," 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
A uniformed guard normally searches bags and parcels carried by visitors before 
they enter the gallery, which accommodates up to 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
The National Westminster bank, near the exchange, was cordoned off and searched 
after another bomb warning, police said. The Royal Bank of Scotland building 
across from the exchange was also evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Press Assn., Britain's domestic news agency, reported that one caller who 
telephoned a warning said: "This is the IRA. The bomb is due to go off in half 
an hour at the Stock Exchange." 
</P>
<P>
"I am horrified that any group would take the risk of so many people's lives in 
a public building," said Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange. 
"The timing of the bomb and the warning -- they all could have gone very 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The exchange's computerized stock trading system was not interrupted, but 
options trading was suspended. Smith said options trading will resume Monday. 
He said about 600 people normally work on the options floor. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices rose marginally following the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Reilly, who was among those evacuated from the exchange, said: "There 
wasn't panic. People were in high spirits, curious. They just thought it was a 
fire."

DECADE-LATE SEABROOK NUCLEAR PLANT AT FULL POWER FOR 1ST TIME

The Seabrook nuclear plant, focus of debate over atomic energy, has reached 
full power for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The $6.6-billion reactor -- among the nation's most expensive -- went to full 
throttle at 9:52 p.m. Thursday, plant spokesman Ron Sher said today. 
</P>
<P>
The plant generated 1,150 megawatts, electricity for 1 million New England 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
It's the most important milestone yet for the decade-late project and another 
setback for anti-nuclear activists whose mass civil disobedience demonstrations 
had made Seabrook a symbol of their movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Reaching full power fulfills the dream we have all worked so hard to achieve," 
said Edward Brown, president of the plant's operator, New Hampshire Yankee. 
</P>
<P>
For plant opponents, the milestone was the latest in a series of 
disappointments since the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Seabrook a 
commercial operating license in March.

Attorneys defending the heavy metal band Judas Priest plan to challenge the 
credentials today of an expert witness on subliminal messages, who contends 
hidden messages in the group's music drove two young men to suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The song "Better By You, Better Than Me" blared through speakers in a federal 
courtroom Thursday as witness William Nickloff Jr. played the song forward, 
backward and speeded up with quick changes in volume to demonstrate his belief 
that the song contains the hidden phrase "do it" at least seven times. 
</P>
<P>
The messages on the album allegedly say, "Try suicide ... let's be dead ... do 
it, do it." 
</P>
<P>
District Judge Jerry Whitehead, who is presiding in the non-jury trial, stared 
at the elaborate audio equipment, but gave no indication that he heard the 
alleged subliminal messages in the heavy metal band's music. 
</P>
<P>
Nickloff was to undergo cross-examination by defense attorneys during a 
half-day court session today. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Judas Priest lead singer Rob Halford charged that 
Nickloff has no credentials to be considered an expert in the field. When 
playing the music in reverse, Halford said, anything can be made of the sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Tipton, a member of Judas Priest, said the so-called "do it" message was 
merely breathing with the sound of a grunt. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth McKenna, an attorney for one of two families suing Judas Priest and the 
record label, said of the alleged subliminal messages, "We demonstrated they 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the parents of Raymond Belknap and James Vance are trying to 
persuade the court that subliminal messages in the band's "Stained Class" album 
led to the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap, 17, was killed by the self-inflicted gunshot. Vance, 19, survived his 
suicide attempt, but was horribly disfigured and died three years later of 
complications possibly associated with the incident.

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN $30-MILLION GERALDO SUIT

A settlement has been reached in a $30-million defamation lawsuit filed against 
television talk show host Geraldo Rivera by a woman arrested during a drug raid 
that was part of a live television special. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was reached Thursday after Rivera spent six hours giving a 
deposition in the suit. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed by Terry Rouse, 32, claimed she was libeled and slandered by 
Rivera during the Dec. 2, 1986, television show "American Vice: The Doping of a 
Nation." 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine possession charges filed against Rouse as a result of the televised 
bust were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera provided commentary during the broadcast as Harris County Sheriff Johnny 
Klevenhagen and several deputies used a battering ram to break into a 
Channelview duplex where Rouse was staying. The woman was dragged out of a 
bathroom and handcuffed before an estimated 15 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"Klevenhagen is going in on a duplex, where an alleged pimp and prostitute -- a 
dude and his lady, real pros -- are supplying truckers speed," Rivera told the 
show's nationwide audience. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse has maintained she was hired to paint the house, which belonged to a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera said Thursday he did not feel responsible for defaming Rouse and that 
her attorneys were perpetuating "a dispute that should have been resolved long 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
"My essential feeling is one of regret," Rivera said before giving the 
deposition. "I think I'm here because attorneys think there is gold at the end 
of a rainbow and they are flogging a dead horse." 
</P>
<P>
Rouse's attorney, Dale Jefferson, speculated Rivera's attorneys were eager to 
settle before the suit went to trial Aug. 20 to avoid having Rivera's salary 
discussed in open court. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1987, Rouse was arrested on three marijuana delivery charges, but a 
judge later reduced the charges and wiped her record clean. She already had 
served seven months in jail on the charges.

The society was founded in 1969 and has 1,533 members worldwide. The Jim Smiths

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that if George Steinbrenner has to sell the New 
York Yankees, he wants New York to be first in line to buy the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect that it is eminently financeable -- for the state and the city," 
Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
"You could even sell bonds." 
</P>
<P>
"He does not want to sell," Cuomo said of Steinbrenner. "He'll do anything to 
avoid that and I hope he can. . . . But if he decided to sell, I wish he would 
come to us." 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo said to "forget the details," such as who would run the team or whether 
voter approval would be needed to sign free agents. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said a major league team would be a great investment. 
</P>
<P>
"They make an average of what, a 35% profit?" Cuomo said. "The best investment 
you could make is a franchise." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees owner is being investigated by Commissioner Fay Vincent for his 
involvement with gambler Howard Spira. Steinbrenner said on Thursday that he 
would not sell the team, even if Vincent suspends him from baseball.

personal plea by Michael Jordan for Davis to help the Chicago Bulls win an NBA 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me three or four times lately. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted me to play on his team real bad," Davis said Thursday. "And it was 
very tempting to play alongside Michael Jordan and get a chance to win a 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
But Davis, 35, a 13-year veteran, chose to remain in Denver because he has a 
daughter about to enter grade school and a wife who has fallen in love with the 
Rocky Mountains, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Denver initially signed the 6-6 Davis as a free agent in 1988. Davis has scored 
18,140 points during his career, making him the 30th-leading scorer in NBA 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to have him," Nuggets Coach Doug Moe said. "There's going to be 
a big turnover on this team this year. We have spots to fill and we'd like to 
fill most of them with young guys. But we wanted to keep some veterans." 
</P>
<P>
Moe said as many as five rookies could find spots on the Nuggets' 1990-91 
roster. The Nuggets also said they have told 31-year-old center Joe Barry 
Carroll there will be no effort made to re-sign him.

Hockey's greatest scorer will be doing his shooting with different sticks next 
season. But Wayne Gretzky's agent and the company that made his equipment 
disagree on the reason for the switch. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Kings' star is changing sticks and equipment after more than a 
decade. Karhu Canada, which makes the Titan sticks and Jofa equipment that 
Gretzky has worn since joining the NHL in 1979, says Gretzky made the switch 
because he couldn't get up to $1 million in a long-term endorsement deal. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Barbor, president of Karhu Canada, said the company offered Gretzky about 
$170,000 annually for three years to replace his old deal -- which paid him 
about $100,000 last year -- that expired in June. Gretzky's representatives 
countered with a request for $250,000 a year for three or four years, Barbor 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Barnett, Gretzky's business agent, expressed surprise that Karhu would 
reveal confidential terms of past deals with his client. But he stressed that 
money was not a factor in the decision and declined comment on whether Gretzky 
was unhappy with the quality of the Titan and Jofa products. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a personal decision and has nothing to do with the economics," Barnett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has not signed with another manufacturer yet.

NORMAN AND FALDO TIE FOR LEAD AT MIDPOINT OF BRITISH OPEN CONTEST 
</P>

<P>
An 80-yard wedge shot for an eagle-3 by Greg Norman and a seven-birdie round by 
Nick Faldo left the world's top two golfers tied for the lead midway through 
the British Open today, where even par didn't make the grade. 
</P>
<P>
The two champions finished the 36 holes at 12-under-par 132, Norman shooting a 
second-round 66 and Faldo tying surprising James Spence of England for the 
tournament's low round of 65. 
</P>
<P>
They led a record low-scoring field into the final two rounds of the world's 
oldest golf tournament. With the last golfers finishing up, it looked as though 
the cut for the last two rounds would be 141, 1-under par. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record-low cut at the Open was 2-over par 146 at Royal Troon a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
If the projection holds up -- and most of the golfers were finished for the day 
-- then lost in the cut will be defending champion Mark Calcavecchia, five-time 
champ Tom Watson, three-time winner Seve Ballesteros, 1988-89 U.S. Open winner 
Curtis Strange and 60-year-old Arnold Palmer, the two-time Open winner making 
his last appearance in the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, the 1986 Open champion, had a round that featured six birdies in 
addition to the eagle at the par-5 14th. He bogeyed two holes. 
</P>
<P>
He needed every stroke he could muster. Faldo, the Masters champion who 
succeeded Norman as the Open champion in 1987, birdied the 15th and 16th, both 
par 4s, to tie, the later with the help of a wedge shot to three feet of the 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
The co-leaders were four shots ahead of PGA champion Payne Stewart and 
Australian Craig Parry. Both had second consecutive rounds of 68 and were a 
shot ahead of Ian Woosnam, Nick Price, Mike Reid and Spence at 137. Woosnam had 
a second-round 69, Price and Reid 67s. 
</P>
<P>
Starting the day tied for the lead with American longshot Michael Allen, Norman 
dropped a stroke at the par-4 second hole. But he quickly made that up, taking 
birdie-3 at the fourth, and then birdied four in a row -- the par-4 seventh, 
par-3 eighth and par-4s nine and 10 -- to take the lead at 10 under. 
</P>
<P>
A bogey-5 at No. 13 dropped him a stroke behind Faldo and Woosnam. But then 
came the shot of the tournament so far. 
</P>
<P>
On the 567-yard par-5 14th, Norman lifted his third shot from the left fairway 
80 yards out. The ball landed about three feet past the hole, spun back and 
plopped in the cut. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a virtual unknown on both the U.S. and European tours, dropped three 
shots on the front nine, birdied the 10th but dropped another shot on the 14th 
to stand 3-under. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia and Ballesteros both started the day 1-under par. But Calcavecchia 
bogeyed the 10th, 14th and 15th, and took a double-bogey 6 on the 13th to 
finish at 2-over 146, with a second-round 75. 
</P>
<P>
"Idiotic," Calcavecchia said. He needed two shots to get out of one bunker, 
"and I fell asleep over a three-footer." 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros, meanwhile, was 1-over 145 with a double-bogey 7 at No. 14 and 
bogey-5s at 10 and 15, in a round of 74. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, starting the day even par, also finished 1-over with a second-round 73. 
</P>
<P>
Spence, inspired by his father's recovery from a major heart attack last 
Christmas and playing in the Open for the first time, was the first player out 
on the Old Course and had an 8-birdie, 1-bogey round of 65, the lowest of the 
tournament to that point. 
</P>
<P>
Other early finishers included three-time winner Jack Nicklaus, 3-under for the 
tournament after a second-round 70; Raymond Floyd and Ben Crenshaw at 1-under 
143, Floyd with a second-round 71 and Crenshaw a 69. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in position on the Old Course to win the tournament with two good rounds," 
he said. "You just never know what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, in at even-par 144 after a 1-under round of 71 in what will be his last 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions were much different from the balmy sunshine of Thursday, but scores 
continued to plummet. The winds off St. Andrews Bay were light and the home of 
golf was being attacked, with Stewart doing the best with the early damage.

PETE ROSE HAD IT ALL, BUT ALL THAT'S LEFT IS SADNESS, SHAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose thought the numbers were enough. All those hits, all those records, 
all those seasons in the sun -- he thought they were enough to excuse him from 
humanity. He thought they meant he didn't have to obey the rules, that 
society's order was somehow beneath him. 
</P>
<P>
It was arrogance, pure and simple, and you can denounce him for it and call him 
all sorts of names -- he certainly has it coming -- but it's mostly just sad, 
really, sad because it's stupid, sad because he was old enough to know better 
and too stubborn and ignorant to learn. 
</P>
<P>
It is a common story now, virtually a staple in this age of telegenic 
overexposure and salaries gone mad. The athlete who mistakenly believes that he 
is bulletproof, that his exceptional skill on the field makes him exceptional 
off it -- how many times have we seen it? We read on and on about drugs, 
gambling, delusion. The fallen star has become a cliche. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it only makes perfect sense that Rose has taken the plot further 
than just about anyone, fallen just about as far as anyone can fall. He never 
could stand to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is going to jail, a federal prison in Kentucky, where he will bunk for 
five months for cheating on his taxes. "I lost my dignity," he said Thursday at 
his sentencing, and he cried real tears because he knows now that he isn't 
bulletproof, that the laws do indeed pertain to him, that his glistening 
numbers are not a lifetime exemption to the world. They always get religion too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that you can't do much more to a man than ruin his name, but Rose 
could have been hit harder. The maximum he faced was six years in the Big 
House, a half-million-dollar fine. But he wasn't one of those mondo tax 
evaders, the ones who bubble up on Wall Street these days. He was just a 
singles hitter, remember. 
</P>
<P>
He was just scamming, that's all, just hustling, trying to steal away with the 
cash he made at the track, at card shows, selling memorabilia. It added up to 
$354,000, which was no pittance, but he paid it back easily enough. He had the 
money. He has reported a lot more than that in his life. He just figured no one 
would care. 
</P>
<P>
He just figured the money wasn't hurting anyone and that he was Pete Rose, by 
gum, and that everyone cheered when he went to card shows or sold them a bat 
he'd used in Montreal. He could get away with it. He could get away with 
anything. People had deferred to him all his life because he was Pete. You 
didn't penalize an icon for the advantages of being an icon. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it was stupid. Sure, he should have known better. But he had long ago 
stopped living in this world. He had long ago ordered his own, skewed world. He 
felt free to run around on his wives, to gamble and traffic with a bad crowd, 
to bully women. According to an article in Gentleman's Quarterly , he wasn't 
much of a father to his oldest daughter. She was too fat. 
</P>
<P>
He figured he could get away with every ugly and selfish bit of it because, as 
he understood life, there wasn't a thing he couldn't buy, a door he couldn't 
open, a problem he couldn't fix. That's the way it was on the field, after all. 
He was special. He had more hits than any player in history. He was entitled to 
exceptions. So what if he gambled, or pocketed some extra money? The world had 
winked at him all his life. 
</P>
<P>
The rules didn't change on him. He just went too far, got too careless. The 
numbers got too big, and this time we're not talking about the number of hits. 
He was throwing around too much money, leaving too many clues. We'll probably 
never know if he was betting on baseball games. The evidence certainly was not 
favorable. 
</P>
<P>
On the day when he was banned for life from baseball, he was the only one who 
didn't understand that the rap was going to stick, that he could appeal and 
appeal and appeal and it wasn't going to matter, that he struck a deal to save 
his name and signed away his future in the game. He resorted to the language of 
the clubhouse that day, talked about making a comeback. Incredibly, he still 
thought the rules didn't apply to him. 
</P>
<P>
After a few months, he hired a flack and went on the talk shows, confessed to a 
gambling addiction and tried to say he was sorry. And he was genuinely sorry. 
You could see that. For all his faults, he is somehow charming in a roguish 
way. Somewhere along the line, the lesson had finally sunk in. He recognized 
that he had abused his mandate, abused it badly. But he couldn't revise 
history. You can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
So he stood in a courtroom in Cincinnati on Thursday and said that the worst 
part of it all was that his 5-year-old son had come home from school one day 
and said that his "daddy is a jailbird." You're made of stone if you don't feel 
a twinge of compassion. Pete Rose does not deserve sympathy, but his crime was 
nothing other than being blind to reality, just plain dumb. More than anything 
else, it's a shame.

A federal appeals court panel today threw out one of Oliver L. North's three 
Iran-Contra convictions and ordered a lower court to determine whether North's 
entire trial was tainted by the use of testimony he gave Congress under a grant 
of immunity. 
</P>
<P>
The former National Security Council aide was convicted May 4, 1989, on three 
of 12 counts stemming from the Reagan Administration's clandestine effort to 
sell arms to Iran and aid the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
The divided three-judge panel reversed North's conviction on the charge of 
altering and destroying sensitive NSC documents, finding that U.S. District 
Judge Gerhard Gesell gave erroneous jury instructions. North was also convicted 
of accepting an illegal gratuity and aiding and abetting the obstruction of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The court held that North is entitled to a full hearing on all three counts 
delving into whether his nationally televised testimony seeped into the case. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling could also mean problems for the conviction of former national 
security adviser John Poindexter, who was convicted earlier this year of five 
felonies in the scandal. Poindexter, like North, gave immunized testimony to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, who supervised the Iran-Contra 
investigation, said he is considering what his next step will be. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone familiar with these proceedings has recognized the difficulties 
presented by the grant of immunity by Congress," he said in a statement. "We 
have diligently tried to work around these difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Iran-Contra investigation was continuing. The grand jury hearing 
the matter was in session today. 
</P>
<P>
North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, described for Congress and a 
spellbound national television audience in July, 1987, how the Reagan 
Administration secretly sold arms to Iran and then used the profits to aid the 
Nicaraguan Contras. He was guaranteed that his testimony would not be used in 
any criminal case against him. 
</P>
<P>
If Gesell determines at the hearing that such tainted evidence was used to 
convict North on the other two charges, the court said, he will be entitled to 
a new trial on those counts as well. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell "must hold a . . . hearing that will inquire into the content as well as 
the sources of the grand jury and trial witnesses' testimony," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
"That inquiry must proceed witness by witness; if necessary, it will proceed 
line by line and item by item," it added. 
</P>
<P>
"We readily understand how court and counsel might sigh prior to such an 
undertaking," the appeals court said of the prospect of such a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a . . . proceeding could consume substantial amounts of time, personnel 
and money, only to lead to the conclusion that a defendant -- perhaps a guilty 
defendant -- cannot be prosecuted," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
The major rulings were supported by two Reagan Administration appointees, David 
Sentelle and Laurence Silberman. Chief Judge Patricia Wald, a Carter 
Administration appointee, dissented.

Pfizer Inc. said it has reached an agreement to sell the company's citric acid 
business to Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. 
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed, but Pfizer said the divestiture will yield "a profit" 
for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer's sales of citric acid, a key chemical component in the food beverage 
and pharmaceutical industries, amounted to more than $180 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer's main citric acid production sites are in Southport, N.C., and 
Ringaskiddy, Ireland, and have 700 employees. 
</P>
<P>
The health-care and specialty chemicals company said it would retain its 
Groton, Conn., citric acid plant.
