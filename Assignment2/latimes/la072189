CHARGERS, AGENT DIFFER ON WHAT'S OWED TO BILLY JOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
He still hasn't thrown a pass in a professional football game -- "live bullets" 
is the way Charger Coach Dan Henning puts it. But rookie quarterback Billy Joe 
Tolliver continues to dominate the early focus of the 1989 Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver was the third player selected by the Chargers (51st overall) in last 
spring's college draft. And like 20 other Chargers, he was still unsigned 
Thursday, two days before the rookies and free agents were scheduled to begin 
summer training camp at UC San Diego. The veterans are supposed to report July 
28. 
</P>
<P>
The list of other unsigned players includes running back Gary Anderson, who led 
the Chargers in rushing last year, and rookie defensive end Burt Grossman, the 
eighth player chosen in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Tolliver whom Henning wanted to talk about Thursday. And it was the 
Chargers' alleged lack of recognition of Tolliver's dollar value that Vic Vines 
wanted to talk about later the same day. 
</P>
<P>
Vines, Tolliver's Texas-based agent, said he might travel to San Diego over the 
weekend to meet with Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football 
operations. But Vines has rejected the Chargers' initial contract offer. And, 
he said, "the Chargers have to make major, major movement" if they expect to 
sign his client. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said the Chargers have offered Tolliver a contract that would increase 
at a later date if the rest of the players picked in the second round sign for 
more money. "I think Billy Joe would make an 
</P>
<P>
error if he doesn't come in here on time," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, only a handful of 1989 second-round choices had signed. And 
only three first-round picks -- Troy Aikman in Dallas, Andre Rison in 
Indianapolis and Tom Ricketts in Pittsburgh -- had signed. 
</P>
<P>
Vines said the Chargers' initial offer was a four-year package that included 
roster and reporting bonuses. Ortmayer raised the offer Thursday with incentive 
clauses that could make the contract more lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are still some wrinkles that need to be ironed out by Sunday," said 
Vines' business 
</P>
<P>
partner, Joe Courrege. "And they are some tough wrinkles." 
</P>
<P>
Vines said he was philosophically opposed to the idea of a temporary contract 
that would hinge on other signings. "If I do that," he said, "I've got to put 
my trust in all the other agents of second-round players and what they are able 
to get for their clients. I've got to agree to a deal that's out of my hands." 
</P>
<P>
The fuss over Tolliver stems from the Chargers' inability to generate an 
acceptable passing offense in 1988. They finished 26th out of 28 NFL teams in 
passing and 26th in total offense. Mark Malone, their starter at the end of the 
season, wound up last in AFC passing for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
When the Chargers drafted Tolliver, both Ortmayer and Henning were ecstatic. 
They talked about how Tolliver represented a significant "upgrade" at the 
quarterback position. Vines' job is to make sure they don't forget all those 
nice things they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real surprised Billy Joe wasn't the third player picked in the first 
round," Vines said. 
</P>
<P>
Spoken like a true agent. But Vines knows he has the Chargers between a rock 
and a hard place in this negotiation. Ortmayer has one year left on his 
contract and can't be sure when Charger owner Alex Spanos will begin wooing 
Bobby Beathard, the former Washington Redskins general manager, to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Henning, a former quarterback, knows the disproportionate importance of that 
position. He also knows the importance of winning right away, particularly 
under an owner like Spanos, who is desperate for the team to improve upon last 
season's 6-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
And even though Henning won't say so in as many words, he is convinced Tolliver 
has more ability and potential than Malone, Mark Vlasic and David Archer, the 
team's other three quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
So he appealed to the media Thursday to get the word out to Tolliver about the 
importance of reporting on time. Courrege, who clashed with Henning in 1984 
over the signings of Falcons Scott Case and Rick Bryan, said the ploy won't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy Joe is strong," Courrege said. "And he's adamant about the fact that he 
will make more money than that center from Rice." 
</P>
<P>
"That center from Rice" is rookie Courtney Hall, the Chargers first pick in the 
second round (37th overall). Hall also is unsigned. "I think Courtney Hall will 
be signed and ready to go (by Sunday)," Henning said. "I don't know what will 
happen with Grossman." 
</P>
<P>
Added Henning: "I think (Tolliver's) agent is making a superior mistake if he 
doesn't work things out . . . if you take the history of that position . . . 
rookies coming in who have an opportunity to take off and get some excellent 
work in the early part of camp." 
</P>
<P>
Responded Courrege: "Henning's been knocked around this league, and for him to 
make a statement like that is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Courrege also used the word "stupid" to describe statements attributed to 
Ortmayer indicating that Hall will get more money than Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
The vitriol didn't stop there. "The Chargers do not have a quarterback who has 
proven he can win," Vines said. "They've got a guy (Malone) who was last in the 
conference. They've got a guy (Vlasic) who has a rehabilitated knee. And 
they've got a guy (Archer) who is a journeyman." 
</P>
<P>
Said Henning: "I don't give a damn about the agent. The agent will never line 
up and never take a snap. That guy's not going to play for us." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer and Henning said the Chargers might be forced to look for another 
quarterback if Tolliver doesn't sign and Vlasic's knee doesn't stand up to 
two-a-day practices. Coincidentally, one of the quarterbacks that interests 
them is Cowboy Steve Pelluer. 
</P>
<P>
Pelluer's agent? Joe Courrege. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Joe Courrege says the seven teams interested in Steve Pelluer are: the 
Chargers, Detroit, Green Bay, Kansas City, Atlanta, Miami and Cincinnati. . . . 
Billy Joe Tolliver is one of nine unsigned Charger rookies. The number of 
signed rookies is zero, although the Chargers agreed to terms with 
seventh-rounder Marion Butts, a running back from Florida State, late Thursday. 
Most of those drafted after the fourth round are expected to be signed by 
Sunday. The 12 unsigned veterans are kicker Vince Abbott, running back Gary 
Anderson, linebacker Keith Browner, running back Lionel James, defensive back 
Leonard Coleman, wide receiver Jamie Holland, defensive end Tyrone Keys, 
quarterback Mark Malone, defensive lineman Les Miller, defensive lineman Joe 
Phillips, linebacker Gary Plummer and running back Tim Spencer. Several from 
that group, most notably Malone, are close to signing. . . . The Chargers will 
scrimmage the Rams a week from Sunday at 2 p.m. at UC San Diego. This will be 
mostly rookies and free agents. Charger veterans don't report until a week from 
Saturday. . . . What price fame? Sharon and Charles Tolliver, the parents of 
Billy Joe, have an unlisted phone number in their hometown of Boyd, Tex. Boyd's 
population is listed at 889. . . . Coach Dan Henning said there will be a 
curfew at training camp, 11 p.m. Meetings will often last until 10 p.m. . . . 
Look for defensive end Leslie O'Neal to play at linebacker in 1989. "It's 
possible that he'll be an up-and-down guy," Henning said, " . . . but in truth, 
he's a linebacker."

FOR PADRES, THIS GAME WASN'T WORTH THE WAIT; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER SHORT DELAY TO GET UMPIRES SQUARED AWAY, CARDINALS GET TO TERRELL EARLY 
ON WAY TO 7-1 VICTORY 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The starting lineups were introduced. The national anthem was sung. The players 
were about to take their position onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
Uh, just one problem here. 
</P>
<P>
There were no umpires. 
</P>
<P>
The umpiring crew was still in their locker room, fervently pacing while 
awaiting the arrival of their equipment. Finally, at about 1 p.m. Thursday, 
just five minutes before the scheduled first pitch, the truck with their gear 
pulled up into San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. They hurriedly dressed, told the 
Padres and St. Louis Cardinals to stand by, and after a 12-minute delay, the 
game was under way. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened," said Bob Davidson, the first-base umpire. "I 
think it got at the airport in plenty of time, but I don't think the driver 
knew the best way to get to the ballpark. He said something about getting stuck 
in traffic." 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres had had any foresight about what would happen during the 
afternoon, they would have thrown up a roadblock, backed by a tank or two, to 
ensure that the truck would never reach its destination. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, once the game started, the Cardinals proceeded to bury them, 7-1, 
leaving the crowd of 23,173 wondering why they hadn't spent the day at the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
Padre starter Walt Terrell certainly had plenty of time to get in his work and 
still get there before rush hour, pitching just two innings and to five batters 
without an out in the third, allowing seven hits and six runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals built a 6-1 lead after three innings, stretched it to 7-1 in the 
sixth, and their pitchers ended the game by retiring 13 of the last 14 batters. 
The Cardinals out-hit the Padres, 15-5, getting four runs and a season-high six 
hits against the Padres in the third inning alone. Meanwhile, the Padres were 
floundering at the plate, failing to advance a runner to second after the 
fifth. Even Jack Clark's hitting streak came to an end at 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, at least we got our pitchers some work today," deadpanned Padre Manager 
Jack McKeon. "And we got some guys (position players) some rest. If you're 
going to lose, you hope to get the crap kicked out of you early so you can get 
some guys out of there." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, coming off two consecutive complete-game performances by their 
starters for only the second time this season, certainly were in no danger of 
having their bullpen become rusty on this day. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Guerrero homered off Terrell in the first. Tom Brunansky added a 
three-run homer in the third. Jose Oquendo stretched his hitting streak to 18 
games, the longest in the big leagues this season. And Terry Pendleton added 
four singles. 
</P>
<P>
The only Cardinal starter who did not get a hit was leadoff hitter Willie 
McGee. And at least he had an excuse -- he just came off the disabled list two 
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the Cardinal offensive barrage, triggered by Terrell's 
performance, McKeon let out a huge sigh, threw his hands up in the air and 
said: "You saw it. You write it. They hit him around pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
The defeat was Terrell's 13th this season, which leads the major leagues. It 
was the first time this season that he failed to pitch at least four innings 
and a far cry from his last outing, when he threw a complete game against the 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
"He was getting beat on his fastball," said Pat Dobson, the pitching coach. "He 
just kept getting the ball up, and they kept hitting them harder and harder." 
</P>
<P>
And as Terrell can tell you, when you're making mistakes with your pitches to 
the likes of Guerrero and Brunansky, they're going to make you pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 21st time in his career that Guerrero has homered at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium, and for Brunansky, it was the sixth in nine games here. There's 
not a park where Brunansky enjoys hitting more, and if the Padres don't like 
it, he said, they can come and get him. 
</P>
<P>
Brunansky is in the final year of his contract, with an option year for 1990. 
If the Cardinals choose not to exercise it, he said, guess who he'll call 
first? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to play here," said Brunansky, who bought a home in Rancho Bernardo 
during the winter. "This is a great place to play, and it's a good team. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, I'm surprised they're not doing better than they are. During the 
winter, that's all I read about was how good they were going to be. And then 
when they started getting guys like Clark and (Bruce) Hurst, I'm thinking, 
'Geez, this team's going to be awesome.' I don't know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the Padres have yet to figure out a way to beat pitchers such as 
Cardinal starter Joe Magrane (11-6). Magrane won his sixth in a row, throwing 
just 90 pitches through eight innings, and lowered his career ERA to 1.15 in 
seven starts against the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Magrane would like to pitch for the Padres, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah, I couldn't take it," Magrane said. "This place is just too pleasant. I 
don't feel competitive when I'm out there. The weather's so beautiful, and the 
park's so perfect, I think my brain would get a suntan if I stayed out here. 
</P>
<P>
"I just like the fact that the only thing I have to worry about the rest of the 
time out here is catching that flight back home on Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Scott Reid, Chicago Cub special assignment scout, has been at Texas Ranger 
games the past two days, fueling speculation that a trade could be worked out 
in the future involving the Padres, Rangers and Cubs. The Rangers, desperate 
for a catcher, have inquired about the Padres' Sandy Alomar Jr. and Chicago's 
Damon Berryhill. They're reportedly offering shortstop Jeff Kunkel, triple-A 
third baseman Scott Coolbaugh and another prospect for Berryhill. If the trade 
is consummated, it would make Cub starting shortstop Shawon Dunston available. 
But none of the three potential teams involved are optimistic about a deal 
being completed before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman/outfielder Bip Roberts played for the first time Thursday since 
suffering a pulled rib cage muscle Saturday night. Roberts pinch-hit in the 
fourth inning and struck out. Although Roberts was the starting third baseman 
when he got hurt, McKeon hinted that the job might not be open when he returns. 
"If we keep going pretty good," McKeon said, "he's going to have a tough time 
starting." . . . Reliever Dave Leiper left after an appearance of two-thirds of 
an inning because of a rapid pulse. It was back to normal by the time he 
entered the clubhouse in the fifth, and he'll undergo further examinations 
today. Leiper suffered a mild heart attack during the winter. . . . Padre 
pitcher Eric Show, on the condition of his ailing back, which has him on the 
disabled list: "It still feels about the same. I hope to start going rehab next 
week. It's frustrating because there are times when you think it's starting to 
feel good, and then you do something, and it feels as bad as ever." . . . Padre 
catcher Benito Santiago threw out Milt Thompson from his knees in the fourth 
inning. Santiago has thrown out six of 10 base runners from his knees this 
season, and when given a chance to throw, has thrown out 17 of 43 potential 
base-stealers. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal starter Joe Magrane has allowed just one homer (to Rex Hudler of 
Montreal) in 131 2/3 innings since coming off the disabled list April 30. . . . 
Padre second baseman Roberto Alomar has a seven-game hitting streak, batting 
.333 (eight for 24) with six runs scored and four RBIs. He stole his 23rd base 
in the second inning, which is just one shy of his total all of last year. . . 
. Padre owner Joan Kroc will present to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and 
Museum a letter written in 1960 by Senator John F. Kennedy to Jackie Robinson 
that discussed the state of civil rights in America. The presentation will be 
made at 9:45 Monday morning in Cooperstown, N.Y.

SPIKING THE PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
WIZARDS OVERCOME THE SOUND OF SILENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Jodi Tu stood inside the small, stuffy gym at Chatsworth High School. 
Occasionally she nodded her head and gestured with her hands while watching her 
volleyball team warm up for practice. 
</P>
<P>
Tu, of Palos Verdes, couldn't hear the thumping produced by white balls hitting 
the orange gym walls or dull wood floor. Nor could she hear the sounds made by 
the hands that slapped the balls. And Tu couldn't hear the groans or hollers of 
the enthusiastic players. 
</P>
<P>
She has to settle for watching, but she's not alone in her silent world. The 
nine members on the Valley Wizards, an American Deaf Volleyball Assn. women's 
team, are unfamiliar with those sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their inability to hear or speak, however, they're competitive in what 
is normally an extremely vocal game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy," said middle blocker Lynn Odom, who lost her hearing to nerve 
damage six years ago. "It was very hard for me to adjust. I was used to hearing 
the ball and playing with a team that screamed and called out plays." 
</P>
<P>
Odom speaks clearly and can read lips. This is her second year playing for the 
Wizards, one of five ADVBA teams in Southern California. There are about 200 
other teams in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Wizards meet at different locations three times a week to practice and 
scrimmage, often against hearing teams. 
</P>
<P>
Today and Saturday starting at 8 a.m. they will participate in the annual ADVBA 
national tournament at El Camino College. The event will feature the nation's 
top deaf teams -- seven women's and eight men's. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the Wizards won the women's title in Chicago. Tu, the ADVBA chairman, 
played on that team and accompanied the national team to New Zealand for the 
World Games. This year the 28-year-old has more of an administrative role with 
the organization, which was started in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Tu still attends all of the Wizards' practices and often works out with the 
team, but she's more of a manager. She said through an interpreter that 
deafness is invisible and often not seen as a handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't tell that we're handicapped just by looking at us," Tu said. "It's 
not clear right away, so it seems like there's nothing wrong. It seems like 
we're just a regular team." 
</P>
<P>
But anyone who knows volleyball, an action-packed sport with lots of talking 
among players and coaches, knows that deaf teams have disadvantages over 
hearing teams. 
</P>
<P>
Wizard Coach Colleen Garner, who can hear, claims there are many differences. 
She was a setter at Burroughs High School and at Glendale College and says 
coaching a deaf team requires a lot of adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend a lot more time in the transition of the game," she said. "We 
practice going from offense to defense and using drastic visual signs. 
</P>
<P>
"At first it was very frustrating because, unlike a hearing team, you can't 
just scream out a play and they can't just say 'I got it' or 'yours' when the 
ball comes to them." 
</P>
<P>
Setter Linda Murashige knows from experience. She played volleyball at 
Gallaudet University (a school for the deaf) in Washington, D.C., mainly 
against hearing teams such as George Washington, Maryland and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
She was also a member (1973, 1977, 1981) of the national team that represents 
the United States in the World Games for the deaf every four years. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a big advantage over us," Murashige said of her National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. opponents. "But we loved it. We loved to play them and show them 
that we could beat them." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter to the Wizards that they can't hear or speak. They just want 
to compete in the sport that most of them grew up playing. 
</P>
<P>
Murashige, 34, even came out of retirement at Tu's request to play for the 
team. Like the rest of her teammates, she'll play a tough but silent game at El 
Camino.

<P>
El Segundo will be gunning for its third American Legion area baseball title in 
four years when it opens the 19th District/4th Area tournament Saturday at 
Blair Field in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles, champions in 1986 and '87, face Millikan at 11 a.m. in the first 
game of the eight-team, double-elimination tournament. El Segundo (22-6-2) 
captured the Bay-Pacific League title with a 9-0 record while Millikan took 
fourth in the Harbor League. 
</P>
<P>
Unbeaten right-hander Rick Clark, who was 10-0 last spring to help El Segundo 
High win the CIF 2-A title, is scheduled to start. Other standouts for the 
Eagles include catcher Garret Quaintance, center fielder Erik Evans and 
shortstop Mark Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
In other openers Saturday, Palos Verdes faces defending area champion Gahr at 
1:30 p.m., La Serna meets Hawthorne at 4:30 and Lakewood plays Miraleste at 
7:30. The losers play at 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Sunday, with the winners meeting 
at 4:30 and 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Games will continue through Friday, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The area champion advances to the American Legion State Tournament on Aug. 5-9 
in Yountville. ROB FERNAS

URBAN WILDERNESS;

<P>
WITH A TEEMING METROPOLIS MERE MILES AWAY, MORE THAN JUST CAMPERS ARE MAKING 
MALIBU CREEK PARK THEIR DIGS

<P>
It's totally dark. You're in the woods camping, just you and your wife alone in 
your tent. Thankfully, the three party animals in the next campsite manage to 
turn off the stereo before passing out. You settle back and just before you 
fall asleep, you hear -- what? -- a scream? A scream! But before you can make 
sure, the sound is muffled by a jumbo jet screeching through the black night. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn finally comes through a canopy of oak trees in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
You unzip the tent and look out across a gently sloping valley, see first light 
glance off the ridge of a distant range. The air smells fresh and clean. With 
daybreak, incidents of the night seem less disturbing, trade-offs attendant 
with the convenience of a park that is within just a few miles of millions of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
You're staying in the newly opened campground at Malibu Creek State Park, which 
is only four miles south of the Ventura Freeway on well-traveled Las Virgenes 
Road and a scant few minutes from the heart of the Valley. You wanted pure 
wilderness but knew that the perfect outdoor experience is almost impossible 
outside of Alaska, especially at a California state park in the middle of 
summer. You almost expected the highway hum and the obnoxious neighbors. Even 
the almost incessant air traffic wasn't out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
But Malibu Creek is unusual, even by state park standards. The freeway provides 
quick access to L. A., turning the campground into a sort of budget motel for 
people seeking jobs or working here for a short time or sightseeing in 
Hollywood. State rules let them camp for 14 consecutive days and 30 days in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a slightly different urban mix here," says Marc McCulloch, the camp 
host who lives in a trailer on the campground, where campers get hot showers, 
clean toilet facilities and some of the best views on the planet for only $10 a 
night, "probably the cheapest rent you can find," McCulloch says. 
</P>
<P>
For people who just want to camp and hike, going to Malibu Creek is like 
running out to a mini-mall. Convenience camping. Just toss the gear in the car. 
If you forget anything, zip over to the nearby market. Do lunch in Malibu. 
Invite a friend to drop in for cappuccino in the morning, when Malibu Creek 
becomes a kinder, gentler park. 
</P>
<P>
You get out of the tent and see cars driving along the crest of Mulholland 
Highway, maybe two miles away. Thinking about people in three-piece suits going 
to the office, you sip a cup of hot coffee. A state park ranger comes by and 
you talk to him. He is on his way across the campground to investigate the 
screams you heard a few hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone complained that a guy was beating his wife," says Ranger Frank Padilla 
Jr., a peace officer who carries a revolver and has the power of arrest. 
</P>
<P>
You ask Padilla what kind of problems he's seen at the campground. "Valley 
kids," he says, "underage kids drinking beer. Transients, too. They bring their 
problems with them, get drunk, and we make arrests. We've also had to boot out 
live-ins." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla drives over to the campsite where the alleged wife-beating took place. 
He talks to the couple and evicts them from the park. 
</P>
<P>
You walk through the campground. Meteor-shaped boulders guard the entrance to 
every site. The sun rises overhead and the summer heat comes on. Of the 60 
sites, about 20 are under the cooling protection of California live oaks. The 
rest -- most in a barren field -- offer no shade, although the state Department 
of Parks and Recreation is considering installing ramadas over the wooden 
picnic tables. 
</P>
<P>
You notice that the campground is mostly empty. There are perhaps six sites 
being used, all of them in the upper end of the horseshoe-shaped campground. 
Since opening May 1 -- after a year of delays to improve the park entrance on 
Las Virgenes -- Malibu Creek has never been full, even on the weekends, in 
contrast to almost 100% occupancy at other state parks. Depending mainly on 
word of mouth to increase public awareness, the state plans to put the 
campground in the computer listings next year, meaning that reservations will 
be taken and the overflow from other parks diverted to Malibu Creek. 
</P>
<P>
The campground sits in the southeast corner of the 6,000-acre park. The trail 
head for the best hiking trails are to the west about 1 1/2 miles away. You 
brush off the ubiquitous sweat flies and decide to hike to Century Lake a mile 
farther into the mountains. Despite its heavy use, the park is kept cleaner 
than most back yards, its sandstone walls having somehow escaped the attention 
of graffiti artists. 
</P>
<P>
You pass through what looks like a prairie of desolation, vegetation so dry 
that it couldn't possibly be alive, but then you see thriving gum plants and 
milkweed and lavender thistles hanging from brittle branches. Life is 
everywhere. You look up. A plane is circling, white vapor trailing behind it. 
Sky graffiti. The message, probably intended for beach-goers a few miles south, 
says "Think Bic." 
</P>
<P>
Crossing Malibu Creek, or what's left of it after months of drought conditions, 
you take a fire road into the mountains. The park is almost child proof. 
Warnings signs keep visitors on the right trails and off the wrong ones. But 
because of a lack of cooling ocean breezes in the summer, hiking can be 
deceptively difficult without water. There is a welcome drinking fountain at 
Century Lake. 
</P>
<P>
But the lake is a disappointment. A portable generator clatters away on the 
shore. The state is employing divers to fix a valve in the damn. They report 
zero visibility in the water. You start the return trip and see a mother 
shepherding four young children to the lake. They are tired, hot and thirsty. 
You tell them about the noise and absence of ambience but they trudge on. The 
kids want to fish. 
</P>
<P>
On the way down the mountain, three cowboys on horseback come trotting by. They 
are riding to Malibu Lake, "a nice, easy ride," one of them says. "You can 
drink beer and not worry about your horse jumping off a cliff." 
</P>
<P>
You take a shortcut down a steep, narrow trail and stop at a picnic area for 
lunch under an umbrella of pine. You watch scrub jays fight over your crumbs. 
They finally leave and you hear a woodpecker in the distance, then silence. No 
generator or plane with earshot, nothing but the outdoors, as primal as ever. 
</P>
<P>
You go home and wish the park was always that perfect. You ask McCulloch about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any big problems here," he says, "and the rangers are cracking 
down on rowdy activity. We only want good people. We want them to get away from 
the city and have a pleasant experience. That's the magic of being this close 
to an urban area."

SHAPIRO LIFTS WOODLAND HILLS EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richie Shapiro hit a key three-run double in the ninth inning and pitched four 
innings of relief to lead Woodland Hills East to a 12-7 victory over Sun Valley 
in a second-round District 20 playoff game Thursday at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro's double was part of a five-run rally that enabled Woodland Hills to 
extend its lead to 12-6. Shapiro, who had relieved Chris Brown to begin the 
sixth, held Sun Valley to two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills trailed, 6-5, in the seventh inning before Allan Puana hit a 
two-run double to give his team the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Ziecheck had three hits for Woodland Hills East and Puana, Rich 
Cosentino, Glen Nahmias and Brett Reisner each had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Chavez had two doubles for Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In other District 20 playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City 5, Newhall-Saugus 4 (suspended) -- Panorama City rallied for two 
runs in the top of the seventh but darkness at Birmingham High forced the game 
to be suspended after eight innings. The game will be resumed today at 
Birmingham at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams loaded the bases in the eighth inning but failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
In the top of the inning, Panorama City failed to score when Joe Cascione 
grounded into an inning-ending force play. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom half, Panorama City's Joe Chaparro relieved starter Sean Henson 
with two out and the bases loaded and retired Matt Tull on a pop fly to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
With Panorama City trailing, 4-3, in the seventh, Shane Wight belted a solo 
home run and and Herman Merchan delivered a two-out single to score Cascione 
with the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the game will play Woodland Hills West at 4 p.m. today at 
Birmingham.

RECRUIT INELIGIBLE FOR AZTECS; 
</P>
<P>
FRESNO'S BAREFIELD, POINT GUARD PROSPECT, FALLS SHORT ON SAT 
</P>

Ray Barefield, one of San Diego State's top basketball recruits, said Thursday 
he has failed to meet NCAA freshman academic eligibility requirements and will 
have to sit out his freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
Barefield, a 6-foot-1, 185-pound point guard from Hoover High School in Fresno, 
said he fell 10 points short of achieving the required minimum score of 700 on 
his Scholastic Aptitude Test. Barefield will not be permitted to play or 
practice with the Aztecs as a freshman and will lose one of his four years of 
athletic eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hurts to have come so close and missed," Barefield said from his 
home in Fresno. "I really thought I was going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Barefield said he has discussed the situation with Coach Jim Brandenburg, and 
the two have agreed that he will enroll at SDSU on scholarship for his freshman 
year and wait to become eligible for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to come to school and get a good start academically," Barefield said. 
"I know it will be hard to sit and not play, but I will make the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
Barefield averaged 19 points and 6.5 rebounds as a senior at Hoover and scored 
a career-high 32 points against Fresno McLean High School. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg was effusive in his praise of Barefield when he signed him to a 
letter of intent during the early signing period in November. He expected 
Barefield would immediately contend for playing time at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
The position could be open for the Aztecs. Bryan Williams, a two-year starter 
until he was suspended late last season for disciplinary reasons, was a senior. 
His replacement, Michael Best, was removed from the team for medical reasons in 
the final week of the regular season, and the university has not made an 
announcement concerning his status for next season. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second consecutive year the Aztecs have had a leading freshman 
recruit become ineligible because of his failure to meet the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. eligibility requirements commonly referred to as 
Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kevin Rembert, a 6-5 swingman from Santa Ana Mater Dei, did not meet 
the requirement and instead enrolled at Arizona Western College in Yuma. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg, who could not be reached for comment on Barefield's status, said 
last week that his two other freshman recruits -- Courtie Miller of Torrey 
Pines High School and Terrence Hamilton of Patrick Henry High School -- 
previously met the Proposition 48 requirements.

SECOND IN 10,000 A BRIEF DETOUR FROM TITLES FOR O'NEIL 
</P>

<P>
Jim O'Neil began the last lap of Friday's 10,000 meters knowing full well he 
was about to relinquish the National Masters 60-64 age-group championship he 
had monopolized the previous four years. 
</P>
<P>
He was nearly a minute behind front-running Patrick Devine of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that O'Neil was fading. In fact, the La Jolla resident was still 
going strong, but his 64-year-old legs simply could not keep up with the stride 
of 60-year-old Devine, who led throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Devine won easily -- as many thought he should, being the young buck in the 
group -- finishing in 37 minutes 24 seconds. But O'Neil, the old man of the 
pack, placed second at 38:22.29, beating several younger competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Although other runners, race officials and onlookers knew the time gap between 
the two was proportionate to their difference in age, O'Neil would not use that 
as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Devine) was tough today," O'Neil said. "He deserved that win." 
</P>
<P>
But O'Neil deserved some accolades, too. He was not merely defending his 
four-time title in the event but was keeping alive his string of 22 consecutive 
appearances in the National Masters Championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-two straight years," marveled Pico Rivera's Larry Banuelos, the 
10,000-meter winner in the 65-69 age group. "That's phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
It is even more phenomenal when one considers that there have been only 22 of 
these meets. O'Neil is the only one to run in all of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll run as long as it's fun," O'Neil said. "My long-range goal is that I want 
to break all running records for the 100-year-old age group." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are no such records -- not yet anyway. But through his 
straight face, it was difficult to gauge whether O'Neil was joking. 
</P>
<P>
There is also O'Neil's history. He hasn't been getting older -- he has been 
getting stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that for the first time in five years, O'Neil failed to win the 
10,000-meter championship. Next year, he'll likely be back on top in the 65-69 
age group. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll definitely put me away next year," Banuelos said. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that in his college days at Miami of Florida, where he ran the 
two-mile and was the captain of the track team, his best mark was 10 minutes, 
and that much later, at age 47, he ran a 9:58. 
</P>
<P>
The difference? 
</P>
<P>
"I was more disciplined than I was as a youngster," O'Neil said. "I had more 
motivation, plus the training methods are different now. In my college days, if 
a training run was four or five miles, that was a long way. As a Masters 
runner, I go eight or nine miles and think nothing of it." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't always the case. When O'Neil first got into the Masters program at 
age 42, he couldn't even complete a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, I weighed 25 pounds more than I do now, and I was drinking a 
lot," O'Neil said. "It took me literally a couple of years to get all the 
martinis out of my system." 
</P>
<P>
It was after he saw a Masters mile at the San Francisco Examiner Games that 
O'Neil decided, "My God, if those guys can do it, I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, he says that decision saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably would not be here today if it were not for (Masters track)," he 
said. "It sounds corny, but the truth is it turned my life around. It's like 
someone who smokes -- or drinks, it's the same thing -- it takes something to 
motivate you to stop. And for me, that was running." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil's new obsession has allowed him to reap many rewards. He has set "more 
than a dozen world records," but his most cherished achievement came at the age 
of 52 when he and his son, Tom, then 17, established the father-son world 
record for marathons. Jim finished in 2:35:08, an American record for his age 
group, and Tom came in at 2:24:26. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a thrill to run with him and share the record with him," Jim said. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem O'Neil has shared his running with more people than just his son. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a picture of him running," Banuelos said. "A little 8-by-10 that he 
signed a couple years ago. He doesn't know it, but I have that hanging on my 
wall at home."

BELGIAN WINS HIS RACE AGAINST AUSTRALIAN, TIME

<P>
As Omar Van Noten peeked over his shoulder on almost every other step of the 
last 200 meters, it was hard to tell if the 42-year-old Belgian was expecting 
to be caught by father time or the sprinting Australian, Gary Hand. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Van Noten held on to beat both, winning the men's 40-44 
10,000-meter race in 31:57 on the opening day of the TAC/USA National Masters 
Track and Field Championships at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"I got very, very tired," Van Noten said. "I got in here at two in the morning 
after hiking the Grand Canyon yesterday. I only slept in the bed for four 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
Van Noten, who had built a 100-meter lead with about 1,000 meters to go, lost 
most of it on the bell lap and won by just 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I was coming at him pretty quick, but I just didn't have enough time," said 
Hand, who finished in 31:59. "I thought he might come back more, but he 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Less than a year ago, Hand, who holds Australian Masters record in the 10,000 
meters and the marathon, had surgery on both his Achilles tendons. He was 
running his first 10,000 since he set the record, a little over a minute 
faster, 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good, but I'm nowhere near my best," Hand said. "I think I was trying 
to run a marathon pace rather than a 10,000 pace." 
</P>
<P>
When Hand left his hometown of Canberra four days ago, the temperature was five 
degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
"This is quite a shock to my system," he said. "The heat wasn't so bad, it was 
the humidity that killed me." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Munro of Australia won the men's 50-54 10,000 in 36:15.60, beating Bent 
Lauridson of Denmark, who finished in 36:24.72. Jimmie Tennison of the U.S. 
took the men's 55-59 race in 39:22.71. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's 10,000, Shirley Brasher of Australia won the women's 60-64 age 
group in 45:32.39. Brasher's time would have placed her a close second in the 
women's 50 race and fourth in the women's 40. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest Masters competitor, Tom Lane of the U.S., was entered in the men's 
95 age group. He threw 3.95 meters in the shotput, which was better than 90-94 
winner Mikko Salonen of Finland, who threw 3.70. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bachelor, some 65 years younger than Lane, was using his first Masters as a 
proving ground. A former college decathlete from Cortland State in New York, 
Bachelor said he was looking to be encouraged enough to continue his track 
career by a strong showing in the pentathlon, and he got one, finishing first 
in the 30-34 bracket with 3,478 points. He had best marks in the long jump, 
javelin, 200 meters and discus. 
</P>
<P>
"I only trained six weeks for this, and I basically took a crash course," said 
Bachelor, who now lives in El Cajon. "At 30 though, I don't feel like I'm 
losing anything. In the last year, I've had (personal bests) in five events." 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, Bachelor was not looking for personal bests. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just excited to compete again," Bachelor said. "The journey along the 
way is what I enjoy. The feeling you get and enjoying the competition." 
</P>
<P>
Bachelor said he will test himself again next March at the Masters Indoor 
Nationals in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Today's events begin at 7 a.m. with the 5,000-meter race walk at Balboa 
Stadium. All other events will be held at San Diego State beginning at 8:05 
a.m. with the 300-meter hurdle heats.

ISAAC ASIMOV: MOON HOLDS CLUES TO EARTH'S DISTANT PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Isaac Asimov 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago this week, on July 20, 1969, human beings set foot for the 
first time on a world other than Earth itself. Neil Armstrong stepped down onto 
the moon's surface and said, "This is one small step for a man, one giant leap 
for mankind." 
</P>
<P>
There were five more visits to the moon in the next few years, and then they 
stopped. No one has visited the moon now in 17 years. So as we celebrate the 
20th anniversary of that first moon landing, we might ask: What was it all for? 
Did we get anything out of it? Was there really a giant leap? 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes; the moon landings gave us a valuable chance to learn about its -- 
and our -- far past. 
</P>
<P>
The Earth and the moon, and the whole solar system, in fact, came into being 
about 4.5 billion years ago. We can learn about the Earth's distant past by 
studying its rock formations. Naturally, the older the rock and the longer it 
has existed in Earth's crust unchanged, the further back our knowledge can be 
pushed. 
</P>
<P>
However, the key word there is unchanged. Rocks don't remain unchanged forever. 
The Earth's crust shifts and rocks are crushed and melted and reformed. The 
force of moving air and water introduces changes even when the rocks aren't 
actually melted. And life itself changes the landscape enormously. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that the oldest rocks we can find are a little more than 3 
billion years old and there aren't many of those. We have difficulty extending 
our knowledge of Earth's history back that far, and as for the first 1.5 
billion years of Earth's existence, forget it. It remains a complete blank, and 
as long as we are imprisoned on Earth itself, it will continue to remain a 
complete blank. 
</P>
<P>
The moon, however, is a smaller body. Its gravitational pull is insufficient to 
hold an atmosphere or any liquid that evaporates easily. That means there is no 
air on the moon, and no water, and no life. Not only is there none now, but 
there never was any. That, in turn, means that the surface has not been 
interfered with by the action of life or by wind or by waves. What's more, 
being a smaller body, the moon has developed less internal heat, and it is 
internal heat that keeps the crust moving and changing even if nothing else 
does. In other words, whereas the Earth is geologically "alive," the moon is 
virtually geologically "dead." 
</P>
<P>
This means the surface of the moon can continue to exist unchanged for much 
longer than the surface of the Earth can, and the moon rocks that the 
astronauts brought back are a billion years older than the oldest rocks we can 
find on Earth's surface. We can fill in a billion years of early history that 
the Earth is silent about. 
</P>
<P>
The moon was created (it is currently thought) when, very early in Earth's 
history, the planet was clobbered by an object about the size of Mars. That 
knocked a huge quantity of Earth's surface layers into nearby space while the 
striking body fused with Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The material that was knocked into space was heated to a vapor but it cooled 
into a mass of innumerable particles of various sizes and these gradually 
coalesced and formed the moon. Since the moon was formed from the outer layers 
of Earth, it is almost entirely rocky and includes very little dense iron like 
that found at the Earth's core. That is why the moon is less dense than Earth. 
</P>
<P>
It took a few hundred million years for the moon to cool down sufficiently to 
have a solid crust, but about 4 billion years ago that solid crust was there, 
and the oldest rocks that have been brought back date from that period. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 4 billion years, the only significant changes undergone by the moon 
happened when it gathered in the remaining objects that still existed in its 
vicinity. These formed the numerous craters and the vast "seas" that now cover 
its surface. From the rocks we have brought back, we can study the different 
stages of that bombardment. The early history was the most active, of course, 
since there were still many objects with which to collide. 
</P>
<P>
As time went on, space was cleared of most of the objects and the moon settled 
down and underwent fewer and fewer other changes. From about 3.2 billion years 
ago onward, things were relatively quiet -- for Earth as well as the moon, for 
if the moon was bombarded, so was the Earth. It's just that on Earth the 
craters produced by that bombardment have worn away, thanks to winds, waves and 
life, whereas on the moon they remain. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there have been changes on the moon comparatively recently, too. The crater 
of Copernicus was formed 810 million years ago, and the spectacular crater of 
Tycho was formed only 109 million years ago. Some small craters were formed as 
recently as 2 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If we were to go back to the moon, then, quite apart from its uses as an 
observatory, a mining station and a new home for human beings, a careful and 
painstaking study of its surface could fill in all the details of its history 
and from that we could deduce what took place on the early Earth, too.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: THE LURE OF OUR NORTHERN NEIGHBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has always been a heavy flow of families moving between the United States 
and Canada because of the vast open border between the two countries. It is 
estimated that one-third of the citizens of New York, Michigan, Wisconsin and 
the other Northern states have Canadian ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
Many American genealogists discover a Canada link during their research, as 
many ancestors settled first in Canada and then came to this country. The 
reverse is often true, also. 
</P>
<P>
Among the settlers of Canada were the Scots and Irish. In 1851, 58,000 Highland 
Scots sailed for North America. Most of those who landed in Canada settled in 
Nova Scotia and Ontario. As early as the 1770s the Irish went to Canada, with 
about 20,000 settling in Montreal and Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans tended to settle in four areas of Canada: Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, 
and three areas of Ontario: the Niagara Peninsula, the Kitchener area, and the 
townships around Pembroke. German settlers first entered the province of 
Ontario from Pennsylvania in 1786. In 1803, when land in Pennsylvania became 
too expensive for many, a major move to Canada was organized and about 100,000 
acres were purchased with settlers pouring in from Franklin, Lancaster, 
Montgomery and Bucks counties of Pennsylvania. Many of these were descendants 
of Swiss-German Mennonites. 
</P>
<P>
Along the north shore of Lake Ontario was a settlement of Hessians -- the 
German mercenaries who served with the British army during the Revolutionary 
War. They fled to Canada with the United Empire Loyalists when the British were 
defeated, and received land grants in Canada. By the 1830s Germans were 
arriving from all parts of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups in substantial numbers made Canada their home: The United Empire 
Loyalists (about 40,000), the Huguenots, Ukrainians and the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest obstacle in the search for Canadian ancestors is the scarcity of 
records of immigration and the almost total absence of passenger lists. The 
keeping of regular passenger lists in Canada did not begin until 1855, although 
a few earlier records are available in the National Archives in Ottawa, and in 
some of the Provincial Archives. In most cases it is necessary to know the name 
of the ship, the port of arrival and the date -- all things that a genealogist 
is searching for in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Records are available of various organized parties of immigrants, and these can 
be found in the Provincial Archives in your area of interest. Many immigrants 
landed at such U.S. ports as New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston, 
Hartford, Conn., Wilmington, Del., Bangor and Kennebunk (Maine), and 
Marblehead, Mass. These lists are in the National Archives in Washington, D.C., 
and date mostly from 1820 to 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Many Canadian records have been filmed by the LDS (Mormon) Family History 
Library in Salt Lake City and are available through its branch library 
interlibrary loan system. 
</P>
<P>
"In Search of Your Canadian Roots" by Angus Baxter is an outstanding new book 
that concentrates exclusively on the sources available for research within 
Canada. It includes a province-by-province survey of genealogical sources, a 
step-by-step guide to the records and record repositories in each of the 11 
provinces and the Yukon and Northwest territories. It is an outstanding 
guidebook, available from Genealogical Publishing Co., 1001 N. Calvert, 
Baltimore, Md. 21202 for $17.45.

MODERATE CAFFEINE OK FOR SOME HEART PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: A friend of mine is being treated by a doctor for what he says is a 
heart rhythm problem. In general, I'd say that he's a good patient because he 
follows an exercise routine that his doctor set up for him and he watches his 
diet and has lost several pounds. But he still drinks coffee. Either his doctor 
has told him that he can have coffee, or he's drinking it against his doctor's 
advice. Isn't he asking for serious trouble by using a caffeine? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Many physicians do warn their patients with heart disease about the 
possibly dangerous effects of drinking coffee or, generally, using caffeine. 
However, the results of one study suggest that caffeine used in moderation will 
not have an adverse effect on patients in relation to heart rhythm 
disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that all heart disease patients can use caffeine with 
impunity. Some patients may be particularly sensitive to the effects of 
caffeine and may have to abstain completely. But these probably constitute a 
small group. Of course, patients who have been told by their physicians to 
avoid caffeine should follow this advice. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If lung cancer can't be seen on X-rays until it's practically too late to do 
anything about it, and if there are no other tests to show if a person has lung 
cancer, what should a person look for in deciding whether to see a doctor? 
</P>
<P>
A: Smokers should contact a physician without delay if they have a cough that 
has persisted for a while, if they cough up blood and if they have experienced 
an unexplained weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My skin often gets dry, and when it gets dry, it itches. I know what to do 
about it, but why would a doctor warn against scratching? It's not as if I have 
blisters which can break if you scratch them. 
</P>
<P>
A: Dry skin may not be blistered, but scratching dry skin may cause the skin to 
break. And if this happens, bacteria may enter and cause an infection. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some friends and I have been reading about risk groups in relation to AIDS, 
and we got to wondering which women are most likely to get the disease. Is 
there any information gathered that would answer the question? 
</P>
<P>
A: In the United States, women who use intravenous drugs make up the largest 
group of women with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to know if diet has any effect on the premenstrual syndrome. 
Are there certain foods that women with the syndrome should avoid? 
</P>
<P>
A: Some foods may tend to aggravate the symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome. 
Salt, for example, may cause bloating and headaches, while sugar tends to 
trigger a craving for certain foods. In addition, caffeine may lead to anxiety 
and irritability. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome may be eased by the adoption 
of a nutritionally sound, well-balanced diet that emphasizes fruits and 
vegetables, and lean meats and fish.

An Italian lawmaker in Rome demanded a ban Thursday on concerts such as the one 
last weekend in Venice by British rock band Pink Floyd that smothered the city 
in rubbish and damaged its monuments. The demand was made as the Venice City 
Council, stung by calls for its resignation over Saturday's concert, was 
studying a proposal to limit the number of tourists allowed to enter the lagoon 
city each day. Sen. Piergiorgio Gradari of the neo-fascist MSI party made a 
formal request to the Interior Ministry to ban events that could threaten 
public order or could damage any city's artistic heritage. Senators from the 
Greens environmentalist party asked the Rome government to put a value on the 
damage done to Venice during the concert. Venice's mayor and City Council have 
come under fire for allowing the free concert to be held without providing 
sufficient sleeping, eating or toilet facilities for the more than 150,000 fans 
who poured into the city. The fans, who included film director Woody Allen and 
actress Mia Farrow, crammed waterfronts and clambered onto monuments and roofs 
of churches to watch the concert, staged on a floating platform off St. Mark's 
Square. ALEENE MacMINN

Prince's "Batman" -- one of the fastest-rising sound tracks ever -- is a smash 
of Gargantuan proportions, soaring high over its competitors on the Billboard 
magazine pop album chart. "Batman" bounded up to No. 1 in just three weeks. 
Look for it to be perched in the top spot for many, many weeks. Speaking of 
high-flying albums, ex-Eagle Don Henley's "The End of the Innocence" flew up to 
No. 17 in just three weeks. Other hot albums: "Love and Rockets" -- No. 16 -- 
by Love and Rockets, and Soul II Soul's "Keep on Movin"' (No. 38). Martika's 
"Toy Soldiers" is the top pop single for the second straight week, once again 
holding off Prince's "Batdance" (No. 2). 
</P>
<P>
* Singer-songwriter Gloria Estefan may be the next big female pop superstar. 
"Cuts Both Ways," which debuted at No. 63, is her strongest commercial album 
yet. Look for it to jump to the Top 30 -- maybe even the Top 20 -- next week.

Los Angeles artist Barbara Carrasco, who has been involved in a battle over her 
latest work "Pesticides!" that is being exhibited in New York's Times Square, 
will give her views on why artists and entertainers need to become "more 
socially conscious" at a press conference this morning in Santa Monica. 
Carrasco designed a 34-second computer-animated film about pesticide use on 
grapes, but had to change three frames of her original piece when the owners of 
the Spectacolor billboard in Times Square refused to show it. "They felt the 
three frames were a little too harsh," Carrasco said Thursday. The 
controversial frames showed children about to eat pesticide-sprayed grapes. 
Carrasco changed the ending to show the mother throwing the grapes away. "I was 
willing to alter the images because I thought the total message of the work was 
important," the 34-year-old muralist and first-time animator explained. 
"Pesticides!" will continue to run every 20 minutes for the rest of the month 
on the Times Square light-board. ALEENE MacMINN

ASTRUD GILBERTO: NAIVETE REMAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was something oddly appropriate about Astrud Gilberto's modest entrance 
on stage at Catalina Bar and Grill on Wednesday night. She slipped between the 
members of her quintet, waiflike as ever, still looking as though she were not 
quite sure if she belonged there at all. 
</P>
<P>
It's been more than two decades since Gilberto became a virtually accidental 
star of the then-new bossa nova via her understated vocals on the recordings of 
former husband Joao Gilberto. Her wispy, almost expressionless voice drifted 
across the music's sensual, samba-based rhythms with the innocence of a child's 
balloon floating on a summer zephyr. 
</P>
<P>
Not much has changed in the intervening years. Gilberto's opening set included 
most of her early bossa-nova repertoire -- "One Note Samba," "The Girl From 
Ipanema," "Desafinado." Some newer material by Gilberto herself and Paulho 
Jobim were clearly products of the same style. 
</P>
<P>
She sang with perhaps more focus and strength than was present in her early 
years. But the vulnerability and sense of naivete were the same. Like Chet 
Baker's vocals, Gilberto's interpretations were affecting less for their 
musicality than for their sense of one-on-one intimacy -- the feeling of 
hearing a lover whisper a soft and tender song. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, Gilberto surrounded herself with a musical setting perfectly tailored 
to display her best qualities. Many of her vocal lines were fortified with 
unison instrumental lines, usually from Jay Ashby's excellent trombone playing. 
And the arrangements always made the most of Gilberto's fragile voice, 
occasionally framing it with brisk riffs, at other times supporting it with 
warm, softly sounded harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
Gilberto will never be a major-league jazz singer; nor, in fact, can she really 
compete with such second-generation Brazilian performers as, say, Gal Costa or 
Flora Purim. But there's no denying the appeal of her musically ingenuous but 
emotionally moving style. 
</P>
<P>
Gilberto continues at Catalina Bar and Grill through Sunday.

ORCHESTRA LURCHES WITH UNLICENSED DRIVER AT WHEEL

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when it appeared the San Diego Symphony SummerPops had its act together, 
it regressed into its bad old habits. The opening four weeks of the current 
season have kept the orchestra center stage, performing generally well-chosen 
and tightly organized programs. But Wednesday night's haphazard tribute to the 
Broadway musical stage gave the orchestra too little to do -- at times the 
players just sat on stage staring into space -- and over-indulged the meager 
keyboard talent of guest conductor Bob Lappin. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, to honor Lappin with the title "conductor" is to insult every real 
conductor, from the late Herbert von Karajan down to the local high school 
bandmaster. Lappin's program biography describes him as a former nightclub band 
leader who (wisely) went into the soft-drink distributing business in 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
On the podium, Lappin was more of a follower than a leader, and his conducting 
motions looked like a comedian's frenetic imitation of a music director. And 
what did that set of Lionel Richie tunes have to do with the program's Broadway 
theme? 
</P>
<P>
Lappin bounded out onto the Hospitality Point stage in an electric yellow 
dinner jacket, looking like a refugee nightclub entertainer. His piano playing 
was loud and heavy-handed, full of predictable, gratuitous flourishes: that 
generic cocktail lounge style over which patrons rightly converse and cement 
business deals. Fortunately, he was less inclined to push his singing, which 
ranked several notches below his piano playing. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra coped as best as it could. In the opening Gershwin medley, it 
sounded fresh and buoyant. Second trumpet John Wilds turned a delicious solo in 
"The Man I Love," and the percussion section made "I Got Rhythm" sparkle. 
</P>
<P>
During a lengthy Irving Berlin medley, the orchestra marked time while Lappin 
accompanied guest vocalists Jan Horvath and David Chaney. Although Chaney's 
pleasantly relaxed baritone proved adequate, soprano Horvath foolishly 
attempted to make singing flat some sort of stylish trademark. 
</P>
<P>
The two soloists fared better in the lavishly orchestrated "Salute to Andrew 
Lloyd Webber" that made up the program's second half. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Horvath was able to compensate for her singing under pitch by 
shouting into the microphone, a less than satisfactory solution to the problem, 
but she did nothing to dislodge Patti LuPone's "Evita" songs from their icon 
status. Chaney pulled out his best stentorian notes for a grandiloquent 
"Memory," although he ducked the highest notes in the final upward modulation. 
His notion of tempo was either slow or slower, and with an unlicensed driver at 
the wheel of the orchestra, singer and accompaniment were seldom together. 
</P>
<P>
The show repeats tonight and Saturday at 7:30.

THE PARODY RUNS AMOK IN YANKOVIC'S 'UHF' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "UHF" (citywide), writer-star "Weird Al" Yankovic tries to jam dozens of 
movie and TV parodies into the kind of dopes-on-the-job plot that was already a 
self-parody in the days of the first "Police Academy." The parodies are 
sometimes amusing, in a talk-back-to-the-TV-screen sort of way, but the movie 
they're stuck in is beyond sendups. 
</P>
<P>
It's another daffy, goofy, sex-crazed-guys story: "The daffy, goofy, sex-crazed 
guys take over a TV station." But here there isn't much sex; perhaps Yankovic's 
target audience is too young. These guys aren't lecherous; they're just daffy 
and goofy. 
</P>
<P>
They race around and bang themselves on the noggin with mops and throw mustard 
on bikers and poodles out the window. They play with their mashed potatoes and 
shoot staples at each other and stick children into sandboxes full of wet 
oatmeal. The love interest, "Saturday Night Live's" Victoria Jackson, might as 
well be in another picture. Maybe she is; halfway through this one, Yankovic 
breaks a date with her and she disappears until the picture's climax. 
</P>
<P>
Yankovic's character, stodgily named George Newman instead of Odd Arnie or 
Bizarre Bob, is a congenital foul-up, constantly lost in fantasies of Spielberg 
movies. He takes over a failing UHF station, Channel 62, after his uncle wins 
it at a poker game. But in true daffy, goofy, sex-crazed guys fashion, George 
quickly piles up the heftiest ratings in town, despite programming shows like 
"Bowling for Burgers," "The Volcano Worshiper's Hour" and "Wheel of Fish," a 
game show whose wheel-spinner is named Vanna Whitefish. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 62's superstar is the janitor, Stanley Spadowski (Michael Richards), a 
Jerry Lewis-style super-goon. Their nemesis is Kevin McCarthy, chewing passions 
to tatters as a network-affiliate czar caught in a perpetual grimace. Soon poor 
Stanley has been kidnaped and McCarthy is trying to foreclose the mortgage -- 
or buy the station, or steal the deed -- and a telethon is under way to raise 
all the money for Uncle Harvey's gambling debts. 
</P>
<P>
As an actor, Yankovic alternates between screaming and staring confusedly into 
space. But Billy Barty, Trinidad Silva and Fran Drescher are fitfully funny. 
And, as Stanley, Michael Richards has one of those scarily intense mad-clown 
looks; he looks as if he could pick up quarters with his eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
In real life, Yankovic is a famous record parodist, sort of the Homer and 
Jethro of rock 'n' roll -- or perhaps the Allan Sherman of MTV. (The film's 
director, Jay Levey, is his manager and video director.) And he has some funny 
ideas. The movie's highlight is a version of "The Ballad of Jed Clampett" sung 
to the tune of Dire Straits' "Money for Nothing." And there's a "Rambo" parody 
with Yankovic mowing down half the Eastern Hemisphere and the Eiffel Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there's something fatally wrong here. Why would someone who keeps losing 
himself in dream-parodies of Spielberg and Stallone movies come up with shows 
like "Druids on Parade" or "Name That Stain"? 
</P>
<P>
The problem with "UHF" (MPAA-rated PG-13) is that everything in it is a parody. 
The only logic for anything that happens is that there's some new thing to make 
fun of -- mostly inanely. It's not much of a movie. But, hey, give these daffy, 
goofy guys a break. Where would the film industry be without them? MICHAEL 
WILMINGTON

A NOSTALGIC CRUISE IN 'VALENTINO RETURNS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leonard Gardner, who helped adapt one of his own short stories into the new 
movie "Valentino Returns" (Century 14), is a writer with real presence. You can 
sense his point of view behind every line he writes, whether it's about about 
the washed-up, journeymen boxers in "Fat City," which John Huston and he made 
into a minor film classic in 1972, or the small-town Central California people 
he and director Peter Hoffman portray here. 
</P>
<P>
Like "Fat City," "Valentino Returns" is about the absurdity and nightmarish 
underside of part of the American Dream. It's about losers who try to dream 
themselves into winners, big-mouths and battered women and small-town lives 
wasting away in the smoke and honky-tonk braggadocio of the local barrooms. But 
where "Fat City" came close to a tragedy of the commonplace, this movie is a 
teen-age sex comedy, another '50s nostalgia picture. Don't let that put you 
off. It's slow getting started and it has flaws, but it's better-remembered and 
funnier than many of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The central character, Wayne Gibbs, is played with winningly bemused 
understatement by ex-rodeo rider and "Lonesome Dove" co-star Barry Tubbs. He's 
a farm worker who has just bought a pink Cadillac that he's christened 
Valentino Returns, in which he intends to cruise to sex and glory. Complicating 
matters are his parents, an incorrigible would-be ladies' man (Frederic 
Forrest) and his incurably fed-up wife (Veronica Cartwright), and Wayne's 
pathologically unreliable buddy, Harry (Seth Isler), who claims to have an 
assortment of randy divorcees and hot-to-trot Swedish models on call, all or 
most of whom prove to be fictitious. 
</P>
<P>
This familiar material becomes funny because it's such a clear-eyed look at the 
dreams most other teen-sex movies try to indulge. The two men closest to Wayne, 
his dad and Harry, cling to their fantasies with terrifying intensity, even in 
the face of injury or chaos. Wayne is more distanced, an observer; he sees the 
things others miss. There is one local girl to whom he's attracted, a 
fetchingly reckless blonde named Sylvia (Jenny Wright). Unfortunately, she 
proves to be a fireball guarded by a dragon: the town slut and daughter of a 
religious fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
That's one of the cleverest insights of "Valentino Returns" into small-town 
American life: the crazy dialectic between puritanism and lechery, family and 
irresponsibility, home and the city's beckoning, sex-soaked nights. The key 
scene is a local tent-revival -- the sign outside says "Christ has returned to 
Earth and preaches here nightly" -- where Wayne and Harry run into Sylvia and 
her parents, and where a typically ecstatic, brow-beating sermon is interrupted 
by a smirking biker (Miguel Ferrer). It's typical '50s symbolism from the 
decade where movie biker-delinquents like Brando and James Dean became twisted 
Christ figures in pop mythology. But it's also a joke about the aspirations of 
the two pink-Cadillac cruisers, who worship the night and easy sex as fervently 
as their neighbors seek a savior who will banish guilt and sin. 
</P>
<P>
Though the picture's control seems to improve as it goes on, first-time 
director Hoffman shows very little visual style. There's barely a memorable 
image anywhere, except perhaps the final going-down-the-road shot. But Hoffman 
is good with the actors. He fills the sound track with prime late-'50s rock 'n' 
roll, and he and his cast catch some of the restless ambience that the music 
fed. Tubbs, Wright, Forrest, Cartwright, Isler and many of the minor 
characters, including Gardner himself as Forrest's sneaky-eyed pal Lyle, have 
fine moments. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Gardner is a poet of the casualties of the American Dream. But 
he's a poet who can smile. "Valentino Returns" (MPAA rated R for sex and 
language) is about people who are headed toward the smoky, beer-soaked 
cul-de-sacs of a "Fat City" but haven't quite reached them yet, or who have a 
chance -- a faint chance -- of breaking out. At its best, it has the giddy 
jocularity of a good laugh at things too deep-down rooted to cry about, too 
catastrophic to even try to fix. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

On the heels of the antiseptic '70s, Lynda Benglis began making free-form 
spills of encaustic and latex. Subsequent hard-driving photos, videos, 
glittered torsos and sexually explicit shapes embraced feminist issues and 
reconnected artistic process with an instinctual base that was out of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
In the '80s, Benglis began doing what has become her calling card: graceful, 
shapely knots formed of mesh armatures covered with sprayed-on coats of 
glistening metals such as bronze, silver or aluminum. When these knots fell 
under the protective rubric of feminist art they were lauded; when Benglis 
sifted out specific social and sexual content to concentrate on archetypal 
organic forms and regenerative forces, cries of "prettified designer art" were 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
Her current show proves once again that after nine years we are still charmed 
by the knots' elegance, amazed by their clean craft and myriad tactile and 
symbolic allusions. Benglis' wall-mounted knots flutter, coil, crinkle and fan; 
vectors of force pull up, down, then roll in spirals that turn on themselves 
forming tight bundles of mass and energy. They often span more than 6 feet of 
wall but look weightless as a silver trinket made to adorn an ear lobe. The 
billowing accordion folds connote everything from fish fins to ripe pods, from 
the dramatic flutter of drapery in the Samothrace Nike to the whole metal-junk 
genre starting with John Chamberlain's metal odes to the myth of the car (many 
of Benglis' works are named after classic autos). 
</P>
<P>
The new works make it clearer than ever that, whatever her format, Benglis has 
always been interested in reconnecting her art and her viewers with the 
decorative, gestural and emotive wellspring at art's most basic core. (Margo

German artist Ole Jurgen Fischer creates energetic abstract oil paintings 
crammed with patterns and shapes that hint at things we are familiar with. 
Formidable scale, low luminosity colors and helter-skelter imagery strewn 
across the canvases then obliterated with quick marks and broad swatches of 
paint heighten the dense, mysterious tone. Burnished browns, blues and grays 
ape the look of wood grain and form floating bits of picture frames buried in 
layers of calligraphic gestures that look vaguely phallic. 
</P>
<P>
Just when you think the imagery is moving toward some thematic resolution, 
Fischer breaks up your train of thought and visual continuity by overlaying 
random X's and wild primitive patterning that makes you think of aboriginal 
body paint. Working in a long tradition of expressive abstraction, Fischer is 
to be credited for making fresh, eccentric marks. Though he is German and spent 
years in the United States printing at Tamarind with the likes of Robert 
Motherwell, his works don't convey the personal Angst of European or American 
Expressionism. Instead the paintings use visual language to establish and 
sustain the same tension we feel in a play by Samuel Beckett, where the only 
relief comes from acknowledging the absence of conclusions. (Jan Turner

The work of died-in-the-wool formalists has proven the old adage that if you 
plumb structure carefully enough, some deeper reality is revealed. 
Australian-born photographer Grant Mudford says that his work is designed to 
take one subject and thoroughly examine its formal features in a controlled 
setting. He applied this strategy to earlier abstractions of urban architecture 
and now scores another coup in a current suite of structurally exact 
black-and-white photo portraits of Los Angeles artists. 
</P>
<P>
Mudford paid his dues for many years working as a professional photographer and 
the technical acumen garnered in the real world pays off. For each finished 
portrait, he shoots several hundred views of the same frontal bust pose, then 
lets a perfectionist eye scrutinize negatives for the best one. Designing his 
own elaborate equipment, positioning his enlarger a great distance from a wide 
blank wall where huge photo paper has been mounted, Mudford is able to blow up 
small, precise negatives and end up with crisp, nearly 5-foot images. Using a 
fine-grain photo paper and controlling depth of field, he records his stark mug 
shots (that is really what they remind us of) with every mole, blemish, wrinkle 
and furrowed brow writ large. 
</P>
<P>
Artist subjects wore what they wished (bare-chested John Boskovich wears a 
cross and an earring) and Mudford toyed with a limited number of variables -- 
background, clothing and hair -- to pictorially organize and exaggerate the 
penetrating stares of some of Los Angeles' innovators. There's Mike Kelley in 
shoulder-length jet-black hair, a puffy-faced Chris Burden whose glint looks 
boyishly edgy. Lean and assiduous as his formidable abstractions, Roy Dowell 
looks out from the dark geometry of his vest, and the handsome face of Renee 
Petropoulos peeks out from the exotic headgear she donned for the sitting.

<TEXT>
<P>
Stephan Huber, who lives in Munich, mingles hints of Bavaria's history of 
decorative arts and crafts with a wary take on post-industrial culture in his 
large-scale sculpture. Highly finished in a fashion that evokes high-tech 
luxury consumer goods and overtly presentational in ways that recall Baroque 
art, this work nevertheless has a deadpan, close-to-the vest quality. 
</P>
<P>
In "Gloria," an elaborate aluminum support holds the large silk-screened image 
of a forbiddingly massive piece of equipment. It sits idle in a vaulted factory 
space that looks like a cathedral. The artist seems to be arguing that 
industrialism is as powerful -- but ultimately as useless -- a force in human 
life as religion. Both have had great edifices built to their glory, but 
neither has solved the basic problems of mankind. 
</P>
<P>
"Kathedrale" offers double images of a highway superstructure, inserted into 
twin billboardlike aluminum structures. The billboard may be the altarpiece of 
the modern age, but it offers an unsatisfying and false salvation. 
</P>
<P>
In several pieces, pool table imagery conveys a metaphor for the fragility of 
life. In "Perfektes Spiel" (Perfect Game), 10 glossy green balls are frozen in 
random alignment within a sleek metal box lined with green felt that hangs on 
the wall, a set of rectangular metal "fingers" tilting it toward the viewer. 
The game is up, and the devil may well be winning. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of an Observing Force -- maybe God, maybe Big Brother -- is 
nowhere as marked as in "Festung" (Fortress). The image of a huge pair of eyes 
is visible within a rectangular slot in a veneered wood block attached to a 
heavy-duty aluminum bar. If an American viewer's thoughts run irrelevantly to 
the oculist's billboard that serves as a prominent image in F. Scott 
Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," the symbolism is similarly troubled. 
</P>
<P>
Still other works resemble compact monuments to nothing in particular. "Testa 
Rosa" is a red lacquered, purified pagoda shape mounted on casters as if to 
mock the very notion of permanent placement in an uncertain world. The stress 
on finish here -- as everywhere else -- also suggests the difference between 
useful and useless work, and the relative worth of impersonal machine-made 
finish versus the patient employment of laborers' hands. 
</P>
<P>
Arresting in a cold, glossy way, Huber's big toys are ultimately about 
consumerism as the opiate of the people. But unlike much similarly themed work 
by contemporary Americans, these pieces seem firmly anchored by a long view of 
history and a searching, almost Ingmar Bergmanesque dialogue with God and the 
Devil. (Karl Bornstein Gallery, 1658 1/2 10th St., to Aug. 19.) CATHY CURTIS

HOME TECH: BOWIE CD ANNOUNCED IN PRESSED RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Savvy record publicists learned early in the compact-disc craze that the best 
way to get critics' attention was to send out a CD copy of a new album rather 
than the conventional vinyl one. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when critics still had few of the discs, writers were so caught up 
with the excellent CD sound quality that they tended to listen to almost 
anything that came their way in the format. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Rykodisc -- the Massachusetts record company that started in 1984 as a 
CD-only label -- has taken the "CD-tease" to an imaginative new level in media 
relations. To outline the company's ambitious plans to re-introduce David 
Bowie's pre-1981 work on CD (and vinyl and cassette), the company has mailed CD 
"press releases" to pop music writers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The standard 5-inch disc opens with a rare 1971 rendition by Bowie of Chuck 
Berry's "Round and Round." The music is followed by a three-minute announcement 
by MTV news anchorman Kurt Loder explaining that Rykodisc's Bowie campaign will 
kick off in early September with a set featuring 45 selections recorded between 
1967 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The three-disc CD set, "Sound + Vision," will contain a sampling of Bowie hits 
-- including "Changes" and "Young Americans" -- plus various rare and 
previously unreleased tracks. Expected to retail for between $50 and $60, the 
package will also contain an illustrated 72-page booklet saluting the career of 
one of the most stimulating figures of the modern pop era, an odds-on favorite 
to eventually make the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The package will also contain a CD-Video disc featuring the 1980 video clip for 
Bowie's "Ashes to Ashes" single as well as three audio selections from the 
Englishman's heralded "Ziggy Stardust" tour in 1972. Rykodisc will then begin 
releasing early next year all of Bowie's pre-1981 albums, from "Space Oddity" 
to "Scary Monsters," at the rate of one or two per month. The albums will 
contain bonus tracks in many cases, perhaps all. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Anne Svingen, spokeswoman for Rykodisc, said approximately 1,000 of the 
press releases -- which cost about $2 each -- were mailed to music writers 
around the country. Members of the company's marketing department had been 
toying with a CD press release for some time and felt the flashy Bowie campaign 
would be an ideal time for one. 
</P>
<P>
CALL OF THE WILD: "Gorillas in the Mix," already in the stores from Rykodisc, 
doesn't have the commercial appeal of a Bowie album, but it is as 
unconventional as anything ever put out by the rock master of shifting personas 
and musical styles. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Krause, a San Francisco bio-acoustic researcher and former studio 
musician, has recorded animal noises and strung various combinations of them 
together via "sampling" synthesizers to make music. What you hear often sounds 
just like electric guitars or steel drums, but it's actually the animal noises 
electronically processed. 
</P>
<P>
In a good-natured track titled "Ape No Mountain High Enough," the lead rap 
vocals were taken from sounds of mountain gorillas, while the piano is from a 
dolphin. Other animals featured on the album include elephants, parrot fish, a 
walrus, coyotes and crickets.

HOME TECH: STATES' LEGISLATION TARGETS VIDEO VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can minors go to video stores and buy or rent sexy, violent movies -- R-rated 
or unrated -- without parental consent? 
</P>
<P>
They often can. That's why state legislatures have been inundated with bills in 
the last few years seeking to limit minors' access to home videos that are 
aimed at adults. Currently 65% of homes with TVs also have VCRs. Many parents 
are concerned over their youngsters' access, through video rental, to movies 
they wouldn't be allowed to see in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the video industry is concerned that a bill recently passed 
in Missouri is the tip of a dangerous legal iceberg. The bill not only 
prohibits the sale or rental of explicitly violent videos to minors, but also 
requires that such materials be kept in an area where the kids can't even see 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado passed an anti-violence law affecting home video last year, but it was 
aimed at restricting minors' access to films depicting actual violence -- 
basically documentary footage. The Missouri bill targets simulated violence -- 
the kind most often seen in movies. Similar bills are pending in Massachusetts, 
North Carolina and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri law is the first to deal with home-video packaging, clamping 
restrictions on pictures on the cassette boxes regarded as lurid. Packaging 
bills are pending in California and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Two other kinds of bills also limit minors' access to R-rated and unrated 
videos. One type is the ratings-display bill, which requires the Motion Picture 
Assn. of America (MPAA) rating to be displayed on boxes. Maryland, Tennessee, 
Illinois, Georgia, Florida and New York have passed such laws. The other 
category is a ratings-enforcement law, which prohibits sale or rental of R- or 
X-rated videos to minors. Tennessee and Rhode Island have ratings-enforcement 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Some states are attacking the problem by the roundabout route of civil 
liability. Illinois has a bill awaiting the governor's signature that would 
make video manufacturers and distributors liable where it can be proved that 
videos provoked someone to commit a crime. Michigan has two civil liability 
bills pending. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gail Markels, counsel for the MPAA, nearly all the video 
legislation is on a state level. So far, no local governments have passed 
significant laws in this area. 
</P>
<P>
The Maryland ratings-display law, passed in 1984, was the first law geared 
specifically to video. While relatively few video-specific laws have passed 
since then, there has been a dramatic increase in the number introduced. 
</P>
<P>
The MPAA often works to defeat these bills. "Our main defense is that the home 
video industry is self-regulating," Markels said. "We point out that there's no 
need for the state to get involved because the industry is doing OK by itself." 
</P>
<P>
The MPAA, Markels said, is not in favor of minors having access to excessively 
violent or sexy materials: "We just don't want unnecessary restrictions on the 
free flow of videos in the market place. We don't want video retailers to have 
to worry about being arrested for selling or renting videos. Many of these 
bills are so vague and so broad that they could apply to just about anything 
rented or sold. If the retailers get into heavy self-censorship, that would 
restrict what's available to everyone in the home-video market place."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
AT PASEO REAL, IT'S THE FOOD THAT COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STERN

<TEXT>
<P>
Go out to a restaurant for home cooking? It's not such a strange idea as long 
as it's cooking we won't get at our home. But home cooking, no matter how much 
we like it, usually lacks the professional constancy of preparation and the 
rhythm of service we rightly expect of a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if what we get is exciting enough to overcome such liabilities as slow 
service, wide variations in preparation and a crude setting, it's worth seeking 
out. 
</P>
<P>
This is the case at Paseo Real, a family-run shack of a place in an industrial 
strip of North Hollywood. The cluttered window and multicolored sandwich sign 
loudly announcing Mexican food are neither inviting nor accurate reflections of 
what you'll find inside. 
</P>
<P>
Through the door are six tables and a counter: a clean, cheery and 
unself-consciously retro place that you'd hardly go to unless you knew the 
cooking was special. It is. 
</P>
<P>
At its best, the Latin-American cooking at Paseo Real is subtle, unexpected and 
downright delicious. 
</P>
<P>
There's no better example than pipian, chunks of savory pork in pumpkin seed 
sauce. The pale green granular sauce at first seems bland, but almost at once 
things start happening in your mouth: a tingle of chili, a taste of herb. You 
may find yourself so engrossed in figuring out what it is made of that before 
you do, it'll be gone. 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion, I tried the roast pork, which was less obscure but no less 
satisfying than the pipian. Marinated, garlicked and sliced thin, it was as 
moist and light as could be. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest achievement in this basically peasant cooking was "fish in 
garlic sauce," a highly sophisticated dish. Half a fresh small fish had been 
fileted (mostly), cooked just to the right moment and served in a perfectly 
balanced garlic-parsley-mustard sauce. It was far more rewarding than many of 
the fish dishes I've had at our most stylish restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
And when I asked the Spanish-speaking cook about the sauce, she proudly came 
out of the kitchen carrying the Mayan stone mortar and pestle with which she 
prepared the dish; she said it wouldn't taste the same made with anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Because the cooking at the Paseo Real is not restaurant-rigid, dishes will vary 
in taste from day to day. One day, garlic soup was dense and redolent with 
garlic; another day it was agreeable but thin and underflavored. I only tried 
the chicken mole once, but on that day it didn't work -- the chocolate had not 
been suffused into the other ingredients. It was the only dish I haven't liked 
at Paseo Real. 
</P>
<P>
Other pleasures to be found there are carne asada a la tampiquena, marinated 
beef filets, and brocheta de cameron, shrimp with bacon and green pepper en 
brochette. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the dishes come with fried plantains; if yours doesn't, be sure to 
order some on the side. In fact, they are so gooey, so naturally molasses-sweet 
that you'll probably want an extra order anyway. It's a rare chance to indulge 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Be ready to enjoy yourself at Paseo Real but keep in mind that home cooking 
means slow cooking. Not only did I have to wait while my sauce was being ground 
in the mortar, but others had to wait for their meals to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
To get the most out of the experience, you may have to let go of your concept 
of time -- at least temporarily -- and keep yourself occupied watching pots 
steaming on the stove. As a noted writer is purported to have said to the head 
of a film studio: "Do you want it fast, or do you want it good?" 
</P>
<P>
 Paseo Real, 5342 Vineland Ave., North Hollywood, (818) 506-9166. Open 9 a.m. 
to 9 p.m. daily. Beer and wine. Cash only. Dinner for two, food only, about 
$22.

EVERYBODY'S ALL-AMERICAN 'MAMA' OF 'SUMMER WIND'; 
</P>
<P>
MOLLY MCCLURE IS MATRIARCH OF BURBANK PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, Ray Loynd is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a recent performance of "Summer Wind" at the Alliance Theater in Burbank, 
a young woman in the audience approached actress Molly McClure, hugged her and 
said, "You're just like my mama." 
</P>
<P>
But that's nothing new to McClure. "That happens to me all the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At 70, McClure has portrayed a number of mothers on stage, including her 
definitive down-home, whip-cracking matriarch in "Summer Wind." Her gravelly 
voice sounds as if she came straight out of the hill country of Kentucky, where 
she indeed grew up. 
</P>
<P>
That sense of Americana has carried her far. At an age when most careers are 
over, hers is just revving up. McClure will soon make her motion picture debut, 
playing the bellowing in-law she created in the 21-month-long Hollywood comedy 
stage hit at Theatre/Theater, "Daddy's Dyin', Who's Got the Will?" The film 
version, which will be distributed by MGM, starts production in rural Denton, 
Tex., after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
She scoffs at retirement. "No way, I'm just startin'." 
</P>
<P>
Only McClure and one other actress from "Daddy's Dyin', Who's Got the Will?" 
(Patrika Darbo) will appear in the film, which will co-star Beverly D'Angelo, 
Beau Bridges, Judge Reinhold, Tess Harper and Amy Wright. The $4-million to 
$5-million production will be directed by Jack Fisk from a screenplay by the 
play's author, Del Shore, 31. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Los Angeles playwright Jean Van Tuyle's boisterous family reunion 
drama, "Summer Wind," will run through July 29 at the Alliance, giving 
theatergoers vintage McClure -- a tough, countrified woman trying to rein 
together disparate members of a family. 
</P>
<P>
The actress, who lives in Studio City, first came to Los Angeles from Kentucky 
20 years ago, following two of her three daughters. She had been active for 17 
years (between 1951 and 1968) with a theater group she founded in Paducah, 
Ken., and, once here, she resumed acting again in such San Fernando Valley 
Equity Waiver houses as the McGaw and Actors Valley. But it wasn't until her 
work in "Tobacco Road" at the Beverly Hills Playhouse 10 years ago that she was 
able to define her niche as a whiskey-voiced, matronly rural character. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't change my voice," McClure said. "What you hear is what I am. I lose 
roles because of my accent. But it's also been a big part of my success. Once a 
casting agent suggested that I use a dialectician to get me into a mid-American 
accent, and then something like 'Daddy's Dyin" came along. I never thought of a 
dialectician since." 
</P>
<P>
McClure only began acting in front of a camera two years ago. She does a lot of 
cameo work in television ("The Women of Brewster Place"), and she's the old 
cleaning woman on a current Winston Tire commercial. But it has been her stage 
characters, so many of them named Mama -- Mama Wheelis in "Daddy's Dyin,' Who's 
Got the Will?," Mama Lillie in "Lost Highway" at the Mark Taper Forum, Mama 
Higgins in "Summer Wind" -- that ring with veracity. 
</P>
<P>
"One time after a show, a woman said to me, 'I don't want to insult you, but do 
you know you look and talk like Marjorie Main. Well, I'm used to that. I don't 
mind at all." 
</P>
<P>
McClure, the only girl in a family of eight children, began smoking when she 
was 17 and smoked a couple of packs a day until she quit only seven years ago. 
That's 46 years of smoking. "I know I'm lucky. What stopped me cold turkey was 
a producer who said to me that my voice was so raspy that they couldn't hear me 
beyond the third row. I never took up a cigarette again." 
</P>
<P>
McClure, who carries her 70 years as if she were 50, plays an extended 
matriarchal figure in real life. She has five grandchildren, ages 7 to 22, and 
they "all look at their grandma and wonder how I learned to act. Except for 
learning to talk like this in Paducah, I don't have an answer."

PROGRAM STEPS BETWEEN HARDSHIP AND HOMELESSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The way the city of Oceanside sees it, an awful lot of its citizens are just 
barely making ends meet, perpetually one paycheck away from homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
So officials have come up with an unusual program to head off the problems of 
being homeless by helping those who aren't yet on the street. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to hand out one-time cash grants to people who are in immediate 
danger of being evicted, according to city housing director Dick Goodman. 
Applicants can receive up to $600 and are not obligated to repay the money, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Families and individuals can qualify by demonstrating that their problem is due 
to a sudden loss of income and that the prospect of having a stable income in 
the future is good, Goodman said. "If they can prove it's just a temporary 
crisis, we can come in and help them get over that one month," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preventing Homelessness 
</P>
<P>
"Once you're out on the streets, it can take up to six months to get money 
together for rent deposits, utility hookups and so on," Goodman said. "The real 
idea of the program is to prevent them from becoming homeless in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the city would like the applicants to pay half the amount they need to 
stay afloat, but, if they can't afford it, their contribution can be reduced to 
$50, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
The program, one of the first proposals of the city's Homeless Task Force, 
which was organized in December, is expected to be in effect by Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The money for the program will come in part from $75,000 in federal funds 
allocated to San Diego County for housing. Oceanside received $10,000 of that 
money -- the maximum grant available to small cities -- and the City Council 
voted to add $10,000 in matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
The prevention program is patterned after a 7-year-old federal rent subsidy 
program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which aids 
about 400 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside families. 
</P>
<P>
The programs differ in that the Oceanside money will be used only for people 
who have housing, not those already on the street, in shelters or relocating. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city technically has less money to hand out than FEMA, there is a 
strong motivation for families in financial trouble to turn to Oceanside 
instead: "There isn't any FEMA money right now," said Mary Lou Sauerborn, 
director of the Ecumenical Service Center of Oceanside. "We get our FEMA 
allocation once a year, and it generally lasts only three months." 
</P>
<P>
The Ecumenical Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to meeting people's 
emergency needs, oversees the FEMA program in Oceanside and will run the city 
program as well. 
</P>
<P>
"In doing this kind of assistance, we use a case management approach -- kind of 
a holistic approach," Sauerborn said. "We try to work with the entire family 
and their problems." 
</P>
<P>
"We will work with them on budgeting and other things that would be helpful to 
keep this family solvent once they're back in the apartment." 
</P>
<P>
Sauerborn wants potential applicants to know that the program is not for 
everyone, least of all the "hard-core" homeless with a long history of 
problems. Applicants will undergo a lengthy screening that will include at 
least two visits to the Ecumenical Center, documentation of the family's 
financial problems and the cooperation of the landlord. 
</P>
<P>
"This is for people who have been paying the rent and doing OK," Sauerborn 
said, "but maybe they were laid off of their job, or one parent left the family 
and the spouse was left with the children to support."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ARTIST SHOWS CHANDLER IMITATORS HOW TO BOIL HARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a fan of good/bad writing, I step aside this a.m. for the winning entry in 
the Raymond Chandler parody contest sponsored by the Friends of the La Jolla 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
It was submitted by free-lance artist Spencer C. Clemmer: 
</P>
<P>
 The lazy waves rolled over like a sleeping fat man. I looked east and saw the 
tip of an orange sun struggling to rise up and start the day. 
</P>
<P>
 I sat in my car and wondered how I could be admiring such a view in a town as 
seedy as Bay City. It was a long day of saps and gats in the hands of not so 
nice people. A day I would like to forget. Then I remembered a bottle in my 
desk drawer at my office and began to drive with a goal in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 I always leave the reception area unlocked so a client can wait if I'm not 
there. This particular morning there was a particular type of client waiting. 
Beautiful, if you like that type and my type usually does. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you Mr. Marlowe?" the oversized lips asked. I guess now days they call a 
mouth sensual if it is that voluptuous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, but I've had a very long night that wasn't quite up to my standards, so 
would you mind coming back tomorrow?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I was recommended to go to a fellow named Sam Spade." 
</P>
<P>
 "Come right in," I growled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I come to you instead of him?" she teased. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can't turn a phrase quite like I can." 
</P>
<P>
 She stood up and followed me into my office. She had one of those shapes that 
would make a priest reconsider his vows. The curves of her figure reminded me 
of the number eight. I motioned to a chair and the number sat down. 
</P>
<P>
 She mentioned something about the decor. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can always try a prettier agency." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I like your attitude, Mr. Marlowe." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah. But don't worry it's just on loan. Tomorrow I take it back and get a 
new one." I had a feeling that once again I was in for another long day. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemmer, 21, who lives in Golden Hill, picked up his $500 prize Thursday night 
at a special screening of "The Big Sleep." A writing instructor at UC San Diego 
was second ($250), an aerospace worker from Hermosa Beach was third ($150). 
</P>
<P>
Clemmer, a painter and a designer of logos and fancy T-shirts, says he came to 
Chandler by way of Bogart movies and the novels of James M. Cain and Dashiell 
Hammett. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read Chandler I knew he was more poetic than the others," Clemmer said. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Library feels the same way. Its celebration of Chandler, who died 
in La Jolla in 1959, continues this weekend with a round-table discussion, 
dramatic reading and fund-raising dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The food, naturally, will be hard-boiled. 
</P>
<P>
Take a Whack at Chewing 
</P>
<P>
Update: The Humane Society of San Diego has finished its investigation of the 
clash between Vada Stevens' dogs and an SDG&amp;E meter reader without finding 
any evidence to contradict the meter reader. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jim Baker says meter reader Joe Cordeiro declined to answer questions and 
instead relayed his answers through an SDG&amp;E attorney. Cordeiro's assertion 
that the three dogs attacked him is plausible and there were no other 
witnesses, Baker says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Cordeiro was "counseled" that next time he should use the 
company-authorized aluminum stick less as a weapon than as a diversion, letting 
the dogs chew on the rubber ball at the end of the stick rather than using it 
to whack the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Endangered Animals 
</P>
<P>
These are tough times for mercantile animals in North County. 
</P>
<P>
The Two Goats sign at a chic clothing store of the same name in Rancho Santa Fe 
has been debolted and spirited away. Its cost is only put at $100, but the 
store owners assign a much higher sentimental value. 
</P>
<P>
The goat sign theft followed the disappearance of the 7-foot-tall fiberglass 
hen atop the Country Store in Carlsbad and a ceramic pig outside a liquor store 
on Highway 101. The hen was discovered in Oceanside, but the pig is still 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
A large stuffed bear on the sidewalk of a toy store in Encinitas has been 
chained down for its own safety.

INS ALLOWS FILIPINA WIDOW, CHILDREN TO REMAIN IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleanor Palisoc's hopes were realized Thursday when immigration officials 
notified the young Navy widow that they are invoking a rarely used measure to 
stop her return to the Philippines and allow her to remain in this country 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional press conference attended by Palisoc, her two U. S.-born 
children and her in-laws, Immigration and Naturalization Service officials told 
the 28-year-old woman she has been granted "deferred action" and allowed to 
continue living and working in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
As Palisoc and her family sobbed quietly, INS District Director James Turnage 
called the action "an unusual remedy" and noted that it would not have occurred 
were it not for Daniel Palisoc's untimely death in a traffic accident March 8, 
one day after the birth of the couple's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"The measure is so rare it's been invoked in only a handful of cases in the 
past few years in the San Diego district 
</P>
<P>
office," said acting INS Western Regional Commissioner Robert Moschorak, who 
also attended the press conference. Turnage said that Palisoc is only the fifth 
person ever granted deferred action by the San Diego office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INS Said She Must Leave 
</P>
<P>
Palisoc's plight received national attention in April -- less than a month 
after her husband's death -- when INS officials notified her that she would 
have to return to the Philippines because she and her husband did not have 
immigration status. Daniel Palisoc was one of thousands of Filipino sailors who 
enlisted in the Philippines under a little-known federal law without first 
being required to obtain permanent residency from the INS. 
</P>
<P>
Several Navy officials and politicians joined the local Filipino community in 
rallying around Palisoc. Capt. John C. Ruff, Daniel Palisoc's former commanding 
officer, and Capt. C. A. Hoyt, who is Palisoc's supervisor at the Navy Resale 
&amp; Services Support Center, where she works as an audit clerk, wrote letters 
to the INS asking the agency to allow her to remain in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are lots of people behind this and I thank everybody who has 
shown their concern and taken action on our behalf," said Palisoc on Thursday. 
"This has been the dream of my husband and me, to be able to raise our kids 
here." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any long-range plans," she added. "I will take each day at a time 
and will continue to work and raise my children." 
</P>
<P>
Former INS Western Regional Commissioner Harold Ezell, who expressed support 
for Palisoc before his departure earlier this month, said Thursday he was 
pleased by the decision. "It was a heart-rending kind of story that shows the 
INS has a heart. . . . I'm glad we were able to do something about it," Ezell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, three weeks after her husband's death, Palisoc's future was threatened 
when the local INS office sent her a letter that began abruptly: 
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with a decision made in your case you are required to depart 
from the United States at your own expense on or before Sept. 24, 1989." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold Her House 
</P>
<P>
A frightened and confused Palisoc sold her house and expected the worst. 
Eventually, Turnage, whose office was initially pushing for her departure, 
relented and recommended to Moschorak that Palisoc be allowed to stay in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Turnage said the letter was based "on a strict reading of the law" 
that said her status as a Navy wife ended with the death of her husband. "But, 
from the outset, we saw so many compelling humanitarian considerations . . . we 
knew we were going to find reasons to allow her to stay," Turnage said. 
</P>
<P>
Some local congressmen offered to introduce private bills to allow Palisoc to 
remain in this country, "but that was so iffy," Turnage said. In the end, INS 
officials decided that deferred action was the best solution for Palisoc, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Under deferred action, INS officials will do a pro-forma review of Palisoc's 
case every two years. Unless she marries a U. S. citizen and becomes 
naturalized, Palisoc, who has lived in San Diego five years, will be able to 
apply for permanent residency in two years. Five years after obtaining 
permanent residency, she will be able to file for naturalization. 
</P>
<P>
Barring those options, either of Palisoc's two children will be able to 
petition for her naturalization when they turn 21. Palisoc's son, Nathan, is 4, 
and Audrey is 4 months. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Palisoc served eight years in the Navy before his death. Normally, 
aliens can enlist in the U. S. armed services only after obtaining permanent 
residency status. However, an obscure law allows Filipinos to enlist in the 
U.S. Navy in their homeland without first obtaining permanent residency. 
</P>
<P>
Other aliens can become naturalized after serving honorably in the armed forces 
for three years. But, under the almost century-old law, Filipinos can become 
citizens only if the United States goes to war while they are on active duty.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY SEEKS FUNDS FOR FOREIGN BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors will seek nearly $260,000 in federal grants to 
help provide more foreign language books and computers at county libraries in 
Baldwin Park and Gardena, officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The board authorized the county librarian to apply for $259,459 in federal 
money for development of specialized services to the Hispanic community at the 
Baldwin Park facility and the Korean community in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be used for Spanish and Korean books and to add computers and 
staff at both sites, said County Librarian Linda F. Crismond. 
</P>
<P>
Crismond said that only 25 such grants would be issued in California and each 
agency may apply for a maximum of two. 
</P>
<P>
Among the eligibility guidelines are "emerging, new and shifting populations," 
Crismond said.

TEA GARDEN TO GET OFF GROUND IN BALBOA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gold Gulch Canyon in Balboa Park is not much to look at now -- just a sparse 
eucalyptus grove nestled in a steep ravine beside the Organ Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
But that will change next week when planners break ground for an $11.4-million 
Japanese garden that they say will rival the world's finest and bring thousands 
of tourists to the secluded site. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's variation on the ancient Japanese art form will showcase miniature 
mountains, waterfalls, paths and a pond. A tea house, cultural center, exhibit 
hall and arbor also will be constructed, said Michael Yamamoto, an architect 
coordinating the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raised $1 Million 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is the hope of the Japanese Friendship Garden Society, a 
nonprofit organization developing the garden. The society has raised $1 million 
so far, enough to pay for the first of five construction stages, said Larry 
Marshall, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, skilled craftsmen and a master designer will arrive from Japan to 
personally supervise construction, according to Yamamoto. Tokyo architect 
Takeshi Nakajima, who built a similar retreat in Moscow, will direct the 
effort, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition hall and a part of the garden along the canyon's rim will be 
finished by spring, according to Yamamoto. The rest of the timetable depends on 
how quickly the group can raise money from private companies, individuals and 
grants, Marshall said. Because of the need to raise funds, the project would 
take at least a decade to complete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in there for the long haul, but it's important for us to start now and 
generate some excitement," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if the garden's construction lasts a decade, that will not match the 
time it took to reach the ground-breaking ceremony. The master plan for the 
garden was approved by the City Council in 1979, after the San Diego-Yokohama 
Sister City Society first proposed the project in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
After its third stage is completed, the 11.5-acre garden will attract 200,000 
visitors each year, Marshall predicted, adding that it could eventually rival 
the San Diego Zoo as a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese garden was built in San Diego in 1915 for the Panama-California 
Exposition, but it was dismantled four decades later to make way for the 
Children's Zoo, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Designers of Japanese gardens stress a more natural look than the clipped and 
manicured European gardens, according to Ernest Chew, an expert in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Used in ancient Japan for Zen Buddhist meditation, Japanese gardens are popular 
worldwide, Marshall said. "There is one in every significant city in the 
world," he said.

NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN STATE, EXXON STALL ON GUARANTEE AGAINST DISCHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state and Exxon Shipping Co. had not reached agreement late Thursday on 
conditions under which the crippled tanker Valdez will be allowed to enter 
state waters for repairs, primarily because of disagreement over the wording of 
a demand stipulating that no discharge from the vessel enter the waters. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was the definition of discharge and the company's inability to 
guarantee that discharges from the damaged ship would not affect state waters, 
a source close to the proceedings said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, divers hired by Exxon to remove six steel plates dangling from the 
ship's hull late Thursday were trying to begin working on the tanker, now 
drifting 7 to 10 miles northeast of San Clemente Island. Rough swells were 
hampering the efforts, the U. S. Coast Guard reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting Here Tuesday 
</P>
<P>
A state Assembly committee on oil spill prevention and response, formed after 
the Valdez disaster in Alaska and three subsequent spills, said it will meet in 
San Diego on Tuesday to hear testimony about the condition of the Valdez since 
it arrived offshore July 9. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the state and Exxon continued late into the night, but 
were not expected to be completed until today. A state demand that Exxon post a 
$20-million line of credit for liability, in case it breaks the agreement, was 
not a critical point of debate, the source said. He added that he was uncertain 
whether the amount had been negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several state agencies, including the Lands Commission, 
Department of Fish and Game and Regional Water Quality Control Board, met early 
Thursday morning and talked with Exxon officials later that afternoon, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several balls in the air at the same time," Anthony Summers, a 
deputy state attorney general, said early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials would not comment on the negotiations, saying only that the 
company's objective is to come up with something it and the state "can live 
with." 
</P>
<P>
A clause in the state's 12-page list of conditions, issued to Exxon on Tuesday, 
stipulates that "there shall be no discharge of waste from the Exxon Valdez 
into or affecting (state) waters." Exxon officials indicated during Thursday's 
meetings that, because of the ship's damaged hull, they could not guarantee 
that no discharge of any kind would occur, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The ship would enter state waters -- which extend 3 miles from the coast -- to 
remove the plates, reach dry dock in San Diego Bay or both. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sporadic Discharges 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez is believed to have caused an 18-foot slick that tests showed 
contained equal parts of weathered crude oil and marine life. Last week the 
ship sporadically discharged small amounts of a bluish substance from its 
starboard side. But no discharge has been seen since Sunday, the Coast Guard 
said, although the tanker is still a suspect as the cause of several sheens 
spotted earlier this week about 13 miles south of it. 
</P>
<P>
The state has also demanded that Exxon concede that the 987-foot tanker dumped 
oil during its 2,200-mile trip to San Diego from Alaska. But company officials 
have been reluctant to make such a concession, describing the discharges and 
the 18-mile slick as "organic material" with a "hydrocarbon content." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials have maintained that the oil content in the discharges was 
probably caused by the scouring effect of the sea on the lower depths of the 
Valdez's tanks, which still held a waxy residue of oil and had not come clean 
in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Samples taken from the ship's tanks, from discharge from the tanker and from 
sheens sighted near the ship are being analyzed, and results are expected 
within several days. 
</P>
<P>
Offshore, divers hired to remove the steel plates from the hull entered the 
waters around the tanker, but were forced out by rough swells of up to 7 feet, 
the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permission to Move 
</P>
<P>
The ship was expected to move late Thursday to calmer waters closer to shore. 
Coast Guard Cmdr. Don Montoro gave Exxon permission to move to waters within 6 
miles of the coast, said Lt. Larry Solberg. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the federal agency nor Exxon was certain when the plate removal could 
begin, or whether it could be accomplished under open-seas conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Removal of the plates, which peeled back from the hull during the trip from 
Alaska and now prevent the ship from entering San Diego Bay for repairs, could 
take five to seven days. The plates jut down as much as 70 feet from the bottom 
of the ship. 
</P>
<P>
"We still think it's a legitimate option. But obviously, we want the divers to 
be safe," said Jan Cool, a spokeswoman for Exxon Shipping. 
</P>
<P>
The divers had tested the waters Wednesday, and an emergency drill required by 
the Coast Guard to test the response of the Valdez crew and equipment was 
completed Thursday, after a supply and recovery boat ready to handle oil 
discharges or spills was deployed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The recovery boat, a salvage vessel operated by the diving company and three 
tugboats that towed the Valdez from Alaska now surround the drifting ship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drill Goes Well 
</P>
<P>
"The drill was satisfactory. Everybody on scene agreed the equipment provided 
by Exxon . . . was adequate to be able to handle any pollution incident," 
Solberg said. "So as long as (the divers) have assessed that it's safe to do 
the operation, we've given them permission to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon's Cool said Wednesday that, although some plate removal might be done 
outside state waters, the ship still will need to enter the coastal zone to 
finish the removal or for follow-up repairs. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter where the plates are removed, the ship will face state scrutiny 
when it enters San Diego Bay, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker was towed from Alaska after hitting a reef and causing the nation's 
worst oil spill, along the Prince William Sound shoreline. The ship was 
scheduled to enter San Diego Bay on July 11 for a $25-million, nine-month 
repair job at National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., which built the vessel in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
But the discovery July 10 of the jutting plates, as well as the slicks and 
discharges, delayed its entry.

4 ABORTION PROTESTERS ARRESTED AT CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four abortion protesters were arrested Thursday morning at a San Marcos medical 
clinic when they refused to leave the waiting room and remove the chain with 
which they had bound themselves together, according to a spokesman for the San 
Diego County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters blocked patients who were trying to enter the office, according 
to Connie Carson, a secretary for the doctor, George Kung. She said she called 
police when the protesters refused to leave. "The patients can't exactly jump 
over them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When sheriff's officers arrived, all but four of the approximately 15 
demonstrators in the street and waiting room dispersed, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested were identified as Angela Phelps, 31, of El Cajon; Georgiana 
Cheek, 37, of Santee; Nancy Scofield, 40, of Poway and Dean Mesa, 30. 
</P>

MUGGY CONDITIONS TO STICK AROUND THROUGH WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The age-old saying, "You can't have it both ways," does not apply to this 
weekend's weather forecast. From alternating cloudy and sunny skies to 
above-seasonal humidity, to thunderstorms in the mountains, the weather will do 
whatever it wants. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the county will experience night and morning low clouds through the 
weekend, National Weather Service forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said. Muggy 
conditions "more humid than in Texas" and hazy skies will follow the 
early-morning burn-off, but straggling high clouds will help keep temperatures 
from soaring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A strong high pressure system is bringing in the clouds, and these clouds will 
hold down temperatures by 5 to 8 degrees," Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past two weeks, San Diego has been getting a heaping dose of humidity 
from moist air wafting in from Mexico. This air flow has raised the normal 
humidity level for July by about 10%." 
</P>
<P>
Highs today at the beaches will range between 68 and 74, nudging up one or two 
degrees by Sunday, Shigehara said. The ocean water temperature is 68 and the 
surf is at 2 to 4 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal highs will range from 75 to 84 degrees and the lows tonight and 
Saturday night will be between 63 to 70 "at a minimum," Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Skies over the coast will be hazy with occasional high clouds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Daytime highs in the inland areas will be a muggy 84 to 94 degrees through the 
weekend. Overnight lows will be between 62 and 68 degrees tonight and between 
60 and 65 Saturday. More sunshine will show through the clouds by Sunday 
afternoon, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Afternoon and evening thunderstorms are possible this weekend for the mountains 
and deserts, Shigehara said. Daytime highs in the mountains will range from 88 
to 94. Overnight lows will be from 60 to 65. 
</P>
<P>
Highs in the deserts of 109 to 116 are expected today and Saturday, dropping a 
few degrees on Sunday. Lows of 80 to 90 degrees are forecast tonight, 75 to 85 
Saturday night.

AT THIS THAI RESTAURANT, THE COOKING FALLS WAY SHORT OF BEING HOT STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thai cooking, with its scalding fresh chilies, handfuls of green and opal 
basils and sweet undertones of coconut milk, would seem one of the bastions 
against standardization. It is nothing less than a scandal when it, too, falls 
prostrate before the American urge to homogenize. 
</P>
<P>
The process has taken place at Taste of Thai in Hillcrest, where many of the 
dishes seem no more exotic than the hot dogs hawked at Padres games. 
</P>
<P>
It is a pretty restaurant -- Thai restaurateurs in San Diego seem to have a 
flair for designing cool, attractive spaces in which to serve what usually is a 
hot, heady cuisine. The location, on University Avenue in Hillcrest, also seems 
just right, since Thai is trendy at present and Hillcrest is about as trendy as 
San Diego gets. Snippets of conversations overheard from nearby tables are less 
about real estate prices than get-away trips to Third World destinations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Main Street Menu 
</P>
<P>
The menu, however, is more Main Street than Third World, and a dish of choochi 
curry eaten with closed eyes will not provide the imagination with instant 
transport to a Bangkok klong. The bulk of the menu is a depressing roster of 
mix-and-match options that seems to have been designed not by a chef but by a 
graduate of the P. T. Barnum School of Marketing. Even a cursory examination of 
the menu gives the impression that the kitchen is organized on an assembly-line 
principle. The entree list begins by mentioning chicken, roast pork, beef, 
roast duck, shrimp, squid, scallops and a vegetable medley, not as dishes but 
as main ingredients to be matched at will with one of 13 sauces from the 
following list. In other words, any of these main ingredients can be had with 
red, green or yellow curry sauces, or with garlic-pepper sauce, or in a 
sweet-spicy finish, or sweet-and-sour, or with ginger, or cashew nuts or fresh 
basil. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, all the cooks need do is fish the selected meat or seafood out of a 
bin and dress it with sauce ladled from the appropriate pot. This seems not 
unlike spreading a hamburger with one's choice of ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise 
or Thousand Island dressing. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen evidently does pair already cooked meats with ready-made sauces. 
Under the specialties heading, for example, the menu lists "crispy duck," which 
it says is a "half duck topped with sweet spicy curry paste." This listing is 
followed by one for "spicy duck," which it describes as "half crispy duck 
topped with sweet spicy curry paste." This would seem to be the same critter. 
The spicy duck was ordered, and it was an awkward and embarrassed bird, one 
that apparently had spent much of the day cooling its heels (it certainly 
wasn't warm) waiting to be spread with a bit of sauce that was about as spicy 
as a copy of Popular Mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mix-and-Match Approach 
</P>
<P>
Roast pork in yellow curry sauce had a little more to recommend it, because the 
sauce actually seemed to have been invested with a little spice, along with 
chunks of carrot and potato. Just like the duck, however, the pork had the 
tough and somewhat greasy quality common to reheated meat, which definitely is 
one of the drawbacks of this mix-and-match approach to restaurant cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Shrimp ordered in the "hot-basil" style, which the menu described as 
supplemented with green pepper, chili and garlic, was not the searing and 
explosive preparation that this dish can be. It was so nondescript and so 
essentially non-Thai-seeming, in fact, that were it served at a Midwestern 
Sunday School picnic, some of the participants would find it little more 
remarkable than the baked beans and macaroni salad. 
</P>
<P>
This point of view was mentioned to one of the restaurant's managers, who 
responded, "Well, it's very subjective. If you want it hot, you have to say so. 
We try to standardize everything." 
</P>
<P>
Standardization is, of course, playing to the lowest common denominator, and we 
get enough of that on television and in political campaigns. If a menu says 
"hot," that's what we expect, and the whole point of going to an ethnic 
restaurant would seem to be to get something out of the ordinary, out of the 
mainstream and beyond the daily experience. When that stops being true, the 
American melting pot will seem to have melted down, and we all might as well 
pop something frozen into the microwave and spend the time saved from dining on 
other pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list includes the typical stand-bys, including beef and chicken 
satay skewers served with a moderately spiced peanut sauce and a nice cucumber 
salad. The spring rolls, which are about half the size of an adult's little 
finger, are advertised as containing ground shrimp and chicken along with 
cabbage and "grass" noodles, but what one sees and tastes are slivered 
vegetables. The accompanying sauce is hot with cayenne, but not subtle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delicate Noodles 
</P>
<P>
Soups again are available on a mix-and-match basis, with one's choice of 
chicken, beef, shrimp, squid or vegetables prepared tom-yum (in broth flavored 
with lemon grass, mushrooms, chilies and lime juice) or tom-khar (enriched with 
coconut milk and pungent galanga root). Salads follow the same principle, and 
the yum salad is a fairly good blend of cucumbers, tomatoes and greens dressed 
with sweetened vinegar, chopped peanuts and a choice of seafood or sliced 
steak. 
</P>
<P>
Among other dishes are noodles, fried rices, several seafood specials (the 
"Thai boat" steams scallops, shrimp, fish filets, squid, white wine and herbs 
in foil) and the eternally popular mee krob, the crisp noodles that probably 
did more to popularize Thai cooking in this country than any other 10 dishes 
combined. Sweet, and so delicate that they almost shatter at a glance, Taste of 
Thai's presentation of these noodles is fairly standard, except that it 
garnishes them with dried shrimp rather than fresh. The flavor of this kind of 
shrimp, which appears often in Oriental cooking, is pungent and anchovy-like.

Recently, ex-President Ronald Reagan speaking in the Guildhall of London's 
financial district said, "You can't massacre an idea. You cannot run tanks over 
hope. You cannot riddle a people's yearning with bullets." He was referring, of 
course, to the slaughter of the students and workers in China who demonstrated 
against social injustice and demanded more freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
If the people in Central and South America could speak to him they would cry 
out, "Yes you can, Mr. Reagan! Have you forgotten Nicaragua?" After eight years 
of war waged against them by guerrilla forces and the wealthy might of the 
U.S., Nicaragua is now the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. After 
29,113 dead, 17,867 wounded, 14,600 orphaned, more than 250,000 homeless and 
$12.2 billion in material losses, the cheery optimism that "ideas can't be 
massacred" might sound hollow to a devastated people. 
</P>
<P>
We know all this. We know that the United States sends more than $1 million a 
day to El Salvador to support a government that is notorious for its death 
squads. More than 70,000 people have been murdered in El Salvador. Even as we 
read of these atrocities the lawmakers in Washington are preparing to vote for 
continued aid. Why? Can the Salvadoran people hope and yearn for peace under 
the rule of the Arena Party of President Alfredo Cristiani and Roberto 
D'Aubuisson? 
</P>
<P>
A similar scenario has been unfolding in Guatemala for almost 30 years. In 
1954, a social democratic government under President Jacobo Arbenz was 
overthrown by the paramilitary actions of the CIA under the "imperial 
presidency" of Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 covert operations were reported in progress by 1984, about half of 
them in Latin America -- a 500% increase from the Carter Administration. Reagan 
wholly supported the extent of foreign involvement. 
</P>
<P>
And now we have President Bush. It remains to be seen how much longer the 
American people are going to be silent as billions of their tax dollars go to 
savage and corrupt rulers. It is not a good way to spread democracy.

Thank you for Kenneth Freed's excellent article ("El Salvador's Land Reform 
Plan Plants Seeds of Conflict, Despair," Part I, June 25). In the last nine 
years, our government has spent over $4 billion in El Salvador. Seventy 
thousand lives have been lost in that country's war. And yet, the fundamental 
problems facing the Salvadoran people have barely been addressed. Chief among 
them, as Freed points out, is the glaring inequality between the wealthy 
landowners and the impoverished peasant population. In the early 1980s, there 
were some very limited efforts at land reform. However, since the right-wing 
Arena government came to power, even the few peasants beneficiaries of those 
programs have been being kicked off of their modest plots of land. 
</P>
<P>
When will the Bush Administration and Congress wake up to the fact that by 
supporting the Arena (i.e. "death squad") government, they are only adding to 
the misery and suffering of the Salvadoran people? When will they realize that, 
like the courageous students in Tian An Men Square, the Salvadoran people want 
meaningful democracy and not just half-hearted reform? 
</P>
<P>
When will they realize that a negotiated solution to the war is not an option, 
but a necessity? The truth is that most of the Salvadoran people, regardless of 
their political beliefs, are tired of the long and arduous war. Enough is 
enough.

Having just returned from Managua, Nicaragua, I was very interested in your 
editorial "Managua's Failing Economy" (June 28). 
</P>
<P>
I think it should better be entitled "failed" economy. Inflation is soaring so 
fast that the cordoba (paper currency) is being overstamped with new value, 
that is, the 20 cordoba note is rubber-stamped to 20,000 cordoba. 
</P>
<P>
For two years I have worked with the Nicaraguan refugees, the freedom fighters 
and their families. I have seen a lot, but I was ill-prepared for the sights of 
the "workers paradise." Upon arriving at Sandino Airport, the first thing one 
sees is squadrons and squadrons of Soviet Hind helicopters (equipped with 
humanitarian Gatling guns). Driving into town one sees Soviet tanks, so newly 
arrived that they are still wrapped in burlap from shipping. 
</P>
<P>
If there were a little less military spending, perhaps I would not have seen 
(and fed) the first generation of families living in the dump! Perhaps I would 
not have had the unpleasant opportunity to feed and clothe two boys -- 9 and 12 
years old -- now living in the desecrated Jewish synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets continue to provide $40 million per month into Nicaragua in 
military aid; the freedom fighters were allocated $40 million in humanitarian 
aid for the year! Maybe if the $17 million that was pulled out of the Contra 
aid for distribution to children's aid inside Nicaragua were distributed, I 
would not see the dead babies that I see on our frequent missions. 
</P>
<P>
It is sobering to see the first generation of poverty. Displaced people, once 
relatively prosperous, learning how to live in absolute poverty -- in the 
shadow of obscene opulence of the Sandinista rulers who truly redistributed the 
wealth . . . they took from everyone and gave to themselves.

NLRB CALLS ON THE UNION-TRIBUNE TO ANSWER UNFAIRNESS ALLEGATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board has ordered a September administrative 
hearing for officials of the San Diego Union-Tribune to respond to allegations 
that the company has engaged in unfair labor practices in its contract 
negotiations with the San Diego Newspaper Guild. 
</P>
<P>
In a 16-page order signed by NLRB Regional Director Victoria E. Aguayo last 
month, the board listed 37 specific allegations against the Union-Tribune 
Publishing Co. The allegations arose from charges raised by the Guild, which 
has attempted to negotiate a new contract with the company for a year. 
</P>
<P>
An NLRB official said an administrative law judge will preside and federal 
rules of evidence will apply at the hearing. Guild administrative officer 
Robert Kemp called the NLRB order "an answer to the question who has been 
stalling negotiations." Union-Tribune Editor-in-Chief Herbert Klein was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the order signed by Aguayo, Union-Tribune officials are alleged to have 
"interfered with, restrained and coerced" Guild members. The order further 
alleges that Union-Tribune officials are "discouraging membership in a labor 
organization" and have "refused . . . to bargain collectively and in good 
faith" with the Guild. 
</P>
<P>
The order lists specific instances of alleged wrongdoing by the company. One 
allegation, dealing with alleged violations of the grievance procedure by 
Union-Tribune officials, was couched in especially harsh language. 
</P>
<P>
According to the document, since Feb. 12, the company has been "generally 
engaging in a pattern of petty harassment, obfuscation, and vituperation 
calculated to substantially undermine the arbitration procedure. . . . " The 
document also alleges instances in which Union-Tribune officials illegally 
"conducted surveillance of employees engaged in Guild activities." 
</P>
<P>
Some Guild employees were told that taking time off for Guild business "would 
count against (them) when being considered for promotion or transfer," 
according to the allegations. The document also alleged that other employees 
were told that the filing of grievances "would count against employees when 
being considered for promotion or transfer." 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 workers at the Union-Tribune are represented by the Guild, 
including reporters, librarians and employees in the circulation and 
advertising departments.

WILL ILLEGALS BE DOWN FOR THE COUNT?; 
</P>
<P>
PLAN TO OMIT THEM IN CENSUS LENDS SUPPORT TO JOB SANCTIONS 
</P>

Institute in Washington. This column is adapted from the current issue of the

<P>
No one in Southern California needs reminding that the employer sanctions in 
the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 have not done much to stem 
illegal immigration. A study released this week by the Urban Institute offers 
the latest evidence that sanctions have somewhat reduced but hardly stopped the 
influx. But because illegal immigrants are concentrated in Southern California 
and a few other regions, the rest of the nation goes about its business 
blithely unaware of this problem. Or so it seemed until last week. 
</P>
<P>
What surfaced was the first of several political (as opposed to economic and 
cultural) problems presented by an unprecedented wave of illegal immigration. 
On an amendment to the Kennedy-Simpson immigration bill, the Senate voted to 
prohibit the inclusion of illegals in next year's census, which is mandated by 
the Constitution in order to reapportion Congress. The measure was introduced 
by Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, one of 14 states that could lose a 
congressional seat in 1990 because of population shifts. The Library of 
Congress estimates that California and Texas will gain at least one seat each 
exclusively because of their growing illegal-alien populations. In 1980, the 
same factor resulted in California and New York each gaining a seat at 
Georgia's and Indiana's expense. 
</P>
<P>
Such shifts are not likely to bring down the Republic. But they point to 
difficulties yet to come. When new districts are created to ensure the election 
of Latinos, they typically include large numbers of illegals and other 
noncitizens. Such concentrations of non-voters magnify the problem of low 
Latino turnout and reinforce the stereotype of a politically passive group. In 
November, 1986, for example, 24,726 votes were cast in East Los Angeles' 
56thAssembly District, compared with an average of 86,010 in Assembly districts 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, we are creating what the British call "rotten boroughs," districts 
that benefit officeholders more than those they are presumed to represent. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, these are new problems for this nation of immigrants. Until the 
1920s, our borders were more or less open and the phrase illegal alien had 
little practical meaning. At the turn of the century there were disputes over 
"unnaturalized aliens" biasing reapportionment in favor of urban states. But 
such tensions got resolved by increasing the size of the House, so that no 
state gained at the expense of any others. Then, in 1911, concerns about 
unwieldiness led Congress to fix its size at the present 435 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in 1920, when that ceiling was first to be implemented, reapportionment got 
caught up in renewed nativist fears. For the only time in its history, Congress 
failed to reapportion itself. When it finally got around to the job after the 
1930 census, immigration had been virtually cut off by the Depression and by 
restrictive legislation earlier in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
How, then, are we to think about these issues? Do illegal aliens have any 
legitimate interests to be represented? It is easy to say no, but once illegals 
are settled here -- in large measure because we lack the political will to keep 
them out -- their presence must be acknowledged. Yet does it make sense to 
install as their representatives assimilated members of the same ethnic group, 
whose interests do not necessarily coincide with those of illegals, and who are 
not accountable to "constituents" unable to press their interests, much less 
vote? 
</P>
<P>
Simply excluding illegals from the census won't address these questions. Nor 
will it address the economic forces that attract immigrants in the first place. 
Finally, such a measure appears to be unconstitutional: Article I, Section 2 
prescribes a decennial enumeration of "persons," not merely citizens or legal 
aliens. The early counts, starting in 1790, included those who at the time were 
ineligible to vote: women, slaves, some Indians and men who did not own 
property. The accumulated wisdom of the Census Bureau and various court 
decisions have only reinforced this inclusive view. 
</P>
<P>
One drastic proposal to curtail illegal immigration is to end our practice of 
granting automatic citizenship to anyone born here, and offer it exclusively to 
the offspring of citizens and legal resident aliens. Yet this proposal, too, 
ignores the basic economic motives of immigrants, and its likely outcome would 
be an ever-expanding, self-perpetuating pool of illegals consigned to a 
permanent inferior status. 
</P>
<P>
Tougher border enforcement seems a wiser course of action, but apparently we're 
not up to the task. Erecting barriers along our borders runs against the 
American grain. Perhaps, then, we will want to re-focus on employer sanctions, 
providing for stiffer penalties and more secure identification than the birth 
certificates and drivers' licenses now easily rented on the streets of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Given the political dilemmas that lie ahead, we may have to reduce the number 
of illegals. For the nation that admits more permanent immigrants than any 
other, there is certainly nothing dishonorable in seeking to control, if not 
exactly eliminate, illegal immigration. Even Latino spokesmen and advocates for 
illegals will want to want to ponder the potential backlash signaled by last 
week's Senate vote.

The miners' strike that began in Siberia's Kuznets Basin before spreading this 
week to the Ukraine is by far the biggest in recent Soviet history. But it is 
hardly an isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, labor problems have sprung up in Leningrad, Eisk, Klaipeda, 
Vorkuta and dozens of other Soviet cities. Nor is the unrest confined to urban 
areas. Besides the coalfields of Siberia and the Ukraine, strikes have also 
been reported on collective farms throughout the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
There is a certain irony in the fact that Soviet workers have turned to 
confrontation just as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has begun to press for 
liberal reforms. Yet the reasons for this are several. 
</P>
<P>
Work stoppages were rare in the past because participants faced harsh 
reprisals. Dissatisfaction was expressed through absenteeism, low productivity 
and labor turnover. In the glasnost era, with Soviet newspapers printing daily 
the accounts of corruption in high places, strikers stand a good chance of 
being heard. And some even get what they want. 
</P>
<P>
S. Krodov, correspondent for Literary Gazette, concluded his story about a 
collective farm strike near the Crimean city of Bakhchisaray with a ringing 
indictment of "the marionette leadership, corrupted by repressions against 
dissenters" and praised strike organizers who "refused to quit, as did so many 
before them, but continue to fight for justice at home." 
</P>
<P>
Labor unrest in the Soviet Union offers us an unusual insight into the human 
cost of the current economic reforms. New rules placed a heavy burden on 
managers to show a profit, without offering them the requisite freedom to 
secure supplies and market their products. These constraints forced some 
authorities to cut salaries and raise production quotas, leaving workers to 
hold the bag. 
</P>
<P>
In Kuznets, metal glazers staged a slowdown to dramatize the hardships they 
faced after they were ordered to speed up their production. In Eisk, bus 
drivers went on strike after they discovered that their monthly pay was cut 
without much warning from the authorities, who simply told them that the rates 
had changed and now they would have to work harder to earn their wages. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet managers have their own horror stories to tell about "self-financing," 
as the new Soviet economic system is called. They are particularly unhappy 
about the arbitrary pricing system. For instance, textile industry managers are 
allowed to bring higher-priced goods to the market and earn larger profits, 
even if there is no visible increase in quality. In the coal mining industry, 
by contrast, prices are fixed by the state and stay low, while production costs 
continue to rise, leaving workers few chances to make headway. 
</P>
<P>
Potentially even more troublesome is the prospect of unemployment, which looms 
ever larger since Gorbachev unleashed his drive to increase productivity and 
cut down to size the managerial staff. According to the Soviet journal 
Sociological Research, the Dagestan Autonomous Republic has 170,000 unemployed. 
The Republic of Byelorussia projects that 200,000 workers will lose their jobs 
in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers are entitled to alternative job offers, but this provision 
masks an ugly reality. Workers transferring to new jobs may lose the housing 
provided by old employers and, in some cases, a city residence permit. The 
forced transfer is usually accompanied by an income loss. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Soviet workers began to form their own labor organizations, such as 
the Labor Initiative Club at the Krasnaia Zaria factory in Leningrad, to 
challenge the official trade unions as the spokesmen for workers' welfare. More 
importantly, workers are beginning to press for political reforms. Miners in 
Siberia and the Ukraine now want to revise the constitution, have greater 
control over the operation of the mines, cut the bureaucracy down to size and 
reverse the disastrous ecological problems in their regions. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev may have sought to combine the best of socialism and capitalism, but 
for the time being he has achieved pretty much the opposite: Inflation, job 
insecurity and labor unrest are now added to the familiar list of Soviet 
economic woes -- long lines, pervasive shortages, goods of shoddy quality. The 
social contract that has bound the party and the people for decades -- "we keep 
in you in food and clothes, you don't ask questions and let us govern" -- is 
clearly unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
Let us not forget, however, that Gorbachev's program includes "democratization" 
as one of its goals. This is where he has something to show for his efforts. 
The case in point is the outline of the new labor legislation published in May, 
which provides for independent trade unions and acknowledges a limited right to 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
If the new Soviet legislature passes this law, we may yet see current reforms 
pushed beyond the half-measures envisioned by Gorbachev. Indeed, this might be 
the best hope left for the Soviet economy.

PLANNERS MUST DECIDE ROAD EXTENSION'S FATE, FOES LEARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A drive by Tarzana residents to prevent the extension of Reseda Boulevard into 
the Santa Monica Mountains, which appeared to be on the verge of success, 
Thursday encountered a few unexpected turns -- and maybe a roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners and environmentalists want Los Angeles city officials to drop a 
requirement that the boulevard be extended past a proposed housing tract so 
that it provides an emergency route into the mountains south of the community. 
</P>
<P>
After some of them chained themselves to a developer's bulldozers last month to 
make their point, City Councilman Marvin Braude pledged to support them -- 
provided the Fire Department agreed that the roadway elimination would not 
create a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, residents cheered when the city's Fire Commission indicated it 
would consider deleting the boulevard extension from city traffic master plan 
maps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Jurisdiction 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, however, the fire commissioners backed away from the issue after 
they were advised by city lawyers that they have no jurisdiction over the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Tarzana residents who came to City Hall were informed that the city Planning 
Department will have to decide whether to eliminate the road -- if and when the 
housing tract developer asks that it be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
To complicate matters, the fire commissioners received a Fire Department memo 
indicating that the department is taking a tougher stand on the road issue. 
</P>
<P>
Besides clinging to the recommendation that Reseda be extended and paved, the 
department has returned to its 1981 stand that a secondary road should be built 
between Reseda and Vanalden Avenue to "enhance fire protection of this 
development," Fire Chief Donald Manning told the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out of the Country 
</P>
<P>
Braude was reported Thursday to be out of the country. Cindy Miscikowski, his 
chief deputy, declined to speculate what his reaction to the Fire Department 
position will be if developer Harlan Lee asks the Planning Department to modify 
the road plans. 
</P>
<P>
There will be public hearings if such a request is filed, she said. "When there 
is a point to cast an opinion, Marvin will be there to cast." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Lee's company was not helping to resolve the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's partner Michael Dieden said late Thursday that his firm will not decide 
until next week whether to file the road-deletion request. "We are going to 
talk to a lot more people and discuss it with the council office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But company lawyer Chris Funk sent a letter Thursday to environmentalist Jill 
Swift that pledged that "Harlan Lee and Partners herewith commits to filing a 
timely application . . . for the vacation of Reseda Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
Swift, a leader of a Tarzana-based group called Friends of Caballero Canyon, 
said the letter leaves her "cautiously optimistic" that an unpaved, ungraded, 
20-foot-wide gated fire road can be substituted for a 74-foot-wide asphalted 
boulevard extension past Lee's tract. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Palmer, president of the Tarzana Property Owners Assn., said his 
organization supports the unpaved fire road concept -- provided it doesn't mean 
that a secondary east-west roadway must be constructed to link Reseda with 
Vanalden. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want any further traffic burden on Vanalden," he said. "It can't be 
widened, it's hazardous at its S curve. It's terribly overtaxed now."

COUNTY STUDIES HOSPITAL FUNDING; 
</P>
<P>
TRAUMA CARE PLAN LIFTS HOPES FOR BUDGET-STRICKEN OLIVE VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County health officials, rushing to fill gaps that have opened in 
the regional emergency medical network, are considering installing a trauma 
center at Olive View Medical Center, which until recently was slated for 
drastic spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Commission on Wednesday 
endorsed a proposal to upgrade the Sylmar hospital's emergency room to 
trauma-center standards to provide care for the San Fernando Valley's seriously 
injured or ill. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision will rest with county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been quite a month around here," Olive View administrator Douglas Bagley 
said Thursday. "One week they're going to convert you to a nursing home, and 
the next week they're going to make you into a trauma center." 
</P>
<P>
In May, the county's chief administrative officer recommended deep slashes in 
the budgets of all county hospitals. In Olive View's case, $17 million would 
have been cut. But the subsequent discovery of surplus state funds in 
Sacramento has relieved budget pressures on the county. 
</P>
<P>
The county supervisors, who are deliberating this week on next year's budget, 
are expected to give Olive View most of its $52-million request, which does not 
include trauma center funds. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all hospitals maintain emergency rooms, but to meet county standards as 
trauma-care centers they must have a wide range of equipment, keep a surgeon on 
duty 24 hours a day and have specialized surgeons on call. 
</P>
<P>
Because trauma centers offer a higher level of emergency service, paramedics 
usually bring the most serious cases to the centers. 
</P>
<P>
In June, St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank withdrew from the trauma network, 
citing heavy financial losses caused by large numbers of uninsured patients 
using the trauma center. St. Joseph's withdrawal left the San Fernando Valley 
with two trauma centers -- Northridge Hospital Medical Center and Holy Cross 
Hospital in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Hastings, head of trauma-care services for the county Department of 
Health Services, said she saw no reason not to convert Olive View's emergency 
room to trauma care as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost in Millions 
</P>
<P>
Bagley declined to estimate the cost of the conversion but said it would amount 
to millions of dollars a year -- "not a one-time cost." 
</P>
<P>
Because Olive View, destroyed in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, was rebuilt and 
reopened 20 months ago, most of its equipment is new "so we probably would not 
have to buy much to become a trauma center," Bagley said. 
</P>
<P>
However, an undetermined number of beds would have to be added to treat trauma 
patients after they leave the emergency room, he said. The hospital's 270 beds 
are " constantly filled, leaving us no slack," Bagley said. 
</P>
<P>
If funds are available, Bagley estimated the hospital could be operating as a 
trauma center in one year.

DAVIS' VOTING GAFFE PUSHES BILL HE FOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE WOULD LIMIT MONEY FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a legislative mix-up, state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) inadvertently voted 
for a bill he opposes, a measure that would place a cap on the amount of money 
developers contribute to build schools. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the prime supporter of the bill Davis accidentally supported was 
partly responsible for scuttling a bill by Davis that could have forced 
developers to pay more for school construction than they do now. 
</P>
<P>
The strange sequence of events surrounding both bills offers a glimpse of the 
lobbying under way in Sacramento over school funding legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The bill Davis mistakenly supported was introduced by Leroy Greene 
(D-Carmichael). The measure, backed by the California Building Industry Assn., 
would bar cities and counties from directly or indirectly charging developers 
excessive fees to build schools. Under state law, developers pay school 
districts $1.56 for each new square foot of construction. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Greene's bill was an attempt to reverse a state appeals court ruling 
that has opened the door for school districts to collect more than the 
established fee. 
</P>
<P>
That ruling -- in Mira vs. San Diego -- said governments could refuse to grant 
zoning changes for developments that would overburden school systems. 
</P>
<P>
Education and building industry officials say the Mira decision indirectly gave 
school districts the power to negotiate with builders, striking bargains to 
withdraw their opposition to developments. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's bill does not mention the Mira case by name, but it clearly tries to 
prevent the sort of negotiations that Mira would encourage between schools and 
industry, said Hunt Braly, a Davis aide. 
</P>
<P>
But Don V. Collin, chief counsel for the building association, denied charges 
that Greene's bill was deceptive. It merely reaffirms existing law, he said. He 
conceded that the bill could indirectly discourage the negotiations that Mira 
could produce. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's bill did not attract any opposition from educational lobbyists and 
appeared to be a routine item when presented to the State Senate on Thursday of 
last week, Davis said. Like many routine bills, it passed without objection on 
a 36 to 0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he must have been outside the Senate chamber when the vote was 
recorded. He was in and out of the chamber throughout the day, and his failure 
to object would have been recorded as part of a favorable vote by all members 
present, he said. "I have no recollection of the bill," he said. "If I had been 
aware of it, I would have raised a lot of hell -- and the bill would have 
passed anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Greene's bill could have a strong impact in Los Angeles County, Braly said. 
Last month, the Los Angeles County counsel, citing the Mira decision, told the 
Board of Supervisors that it could consider the effects of development on 
schools when weighing building proposals. This opinion reversed a previous 
county policy. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Davis agreed to co-sponsor a bill by Assemblyman Thomas M. Hannigan 
(D-Fairfield), which said cities and counties could only approve new 
developments if financing was available for schools, roads and other public 
services. The bill passed the Assembly 43-34. 
</P>
<P>
The building association, saying the bill would "accommodate every whim for a 
public facility," urged its members to lobby their senators to vote against the 
bill. Last month, the Senate Local Government Committee referred the 
legislation to interim study, a procedural move that Davis called a "polite way 
of killing the bill."

PLEASE, NO MORE 'DEVELOPMENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a homeowner in the San Fernando Valley for 38 years, I wish to protest the 
building of more apartments and condominiums in this Valley. What we need is 
more open space and less crowding. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, when I become a volunteer for this city, I heard our city fathers 
talking about putting a moratorium on growth to preserve open space. What 
happened to those plans? The developers somehow convinced the city/county that 
"more is better." 
</P>
<P>
Most developers don't care about quality. If they did, they wouldn't build 
right up to the sidewalk and on every inch of space so children have no place 
to play and so high that the mountain views are gone for everyone else in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
It has to be greed that causes them to build ugly, minimum quality apartments 
and condominiums, while living services are deteriorating, such as play areas, 
streets, sewers, schools and health services. We are being gobbled up by greed 
and the city/county fathers are helping the builders and developers swallow us. 
</P>
<P>
What have been the results of this overbuilding and consequent overcrowding? 
Freeways jammed, sometimes 14 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
No subway, tram or train, elevated or otherwise is going to solve the problem. 
Two or more passenger lanes and direct route lanes on the present freeways will 
bring a little relief. 
</P>
<P>
That won't solve the emission-polluting problem. Every day the air we and our 
children breathe is making us sick, only to send us to the overcrowded 
hospitals and doctors' offices. 
</P>
<P>
The trauma centers and clinics are closing and more and more people are forced 
to do without needed care. Overcrowding of our schools contributes to student 
dropout, which leads to mischief, crime and gang violence. Jails and juvenile 
centers cannot handle the overflow. 
</P>
<P>
My prediction is, if nothing is done, the greed of the builders will destroy 
the city I have come to love, Los Angeles. Without halting the rapid building 
and consequent overcrowding, I predict that this city will become a wasteland 
with unhealthly air, land and ocean.

TREES PLEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley has instituted a movement to beautify our city by the 
planting of new trees. A wonderful idea. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has spent even a few minutes on one of the tree-lined streets of 
Pasadena can appreciate the validity of the principle. The huge ash trees that 
arch high into the sky and almost meet their neighbors' across the street form 
an avenue of quiet shade. The values are acoustical as well as visual and 
cooling. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many of our San Fernando Valley streets have never had a chance 
to even come close to such a desirable realization. There are a couple of 
reasons for our death of tree-shaded streets. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the street trees are of species that do not mature into shade trees. 
Some of them are more on the order of overgrown shrubs. Some species of trees 
seem to be so short-lived that after 30 years or so, many of the streets have 
only two or three trees per block of the original street trees. Those trees 
that have been lost to wind storms, old age, etc., have not been replaced. A 
five-minute drive through almost any 30-year-old subdivision will offer a 
startling contrast between the haves and have-nots. Streets with trees and 
streets without. The desirability of the trees is immediately obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically the city tree people come through the neighborhood and massacre 
the few trees that were have remaining, presumably to allow access for our 
trash trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bradley's noble endeavor to improve our environment could and should 
begin with our existing street trees. Our planners should approve new 
guidelines on the selection of plant materials, and our city council should 
take the lead in carrying out a program to plant replacement trees and to 
ensure the proper professional maintenance thereof.

MISLEADING VIEW OF OUTSIDE NURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Johnson's story "Nursing Registries Booming" (June 4) creates a somewhat 
misleading, and potentially alarming, picture of our use of nursing registry 
personnel by suggesting that those who lack adequate skills and training are in 
the majority. 
</P>
<P>
In fact many of the registry personnel utilized by Kaiser Permanente are highly 
regarded and in some cases considered part of the nursing "family." 
</P>
<P>
The current nursing shortage has created a heavy reliance on agency personnel 
by most health care organizations and until the crisis is resolved that 
reliance will continue. While nursing registries are not a solution, they are 
nevertheless an integral part of today's nursing picture. To depict them in 
such a uniformly negative light does a disservice to the entire nursing 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
It is essential that the media portray a balanced viewpoint of nursing which 
would include focusing on the challenging, demanding, exciting and rewarding 
profession it truly is.

BURBANK PARKS BOARD REJECTS SPORTS COMPLEX IN THE HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank Parks and Recreation Board on Thursday rejected plans for an 
$8-million sports and tennis center in the Verdugo Mountains at an emotional 
eight-hour hearing marked by disputes about the effect such a facility would 
have on traffic and noise in adjoining single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 3 to 2 to go along with a staff recommendation that Stough Park 
Family Sports Center not be built until the environmental impact of the center 
and other planned recreational facilities in the Verdugo Mountains is 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Starleaf and Associates, which wants to build the center, is expected to 
appeal the decision before the Burbank City Council next month. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people attended the board meeting at John Muir Junior High 
School. The meeting was repeatedly interrupted by applause from residents on 
both sides of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Property Values 
</P>
<P>
Many in the audience felt that the center would ruin the hillside, 
commercialize city parkland and reduce property values. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not against the concept, and I think it's a great idea," said Carol 
DePhillip, who has lived in the hillside area for a year. "But this should not 
be up there. If we go up there and tear down the hillsides, we will never be 
able to get them back. It's an unnecessary destruction of nature and wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
But other residents said the center was needed and posed no danger to 
surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"There is obviously a great interest in tennis in Burbank and not enough 
programs or courts available," Georgette Bishop said. "It's a shame that once 
again, a few people with a not-in-my-back-yard philosophy are trying to kill 
such a wonderful opportunity for our community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regional Center 
</P>
<P>
Starleaf had hoped that the facility would become one of the largest of its 
kind in Southern California, as well as one of five regional training centers 
of the United States Tennis Assn., the official sponsor for national tennis 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The center would include 30 tennis courts, a center court for 2,000 spectators, 
swimming pool, clubhouse and an 8,000-square-foot luxury restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Several homeowners earlier this year had voiced similar complaints about a 
summer concert season at the Starlight Amphitheatre, which is near the site of 
the proposed sports center. Protests forced cancellation of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Parks and Recreation's staff opposed the tennis center because it would be 
built in an area where other traffic-generating projects are located or being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the amphitheater, the area includes DeBell Golf Course, the 
Castaway restaurant and Wildwood Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
Parks and Recreation Director Richard R. Inga said the city plans to improve 
parkland in the area, and the Castaway has announced intentions to expand the 
restaurant, both of which would increase traffic in the area.

HEALTH CARE PROGRAM FUELS DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
DOMINGUEZ HILLS PLAN FOR CONSOLIDATION RAISES QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Robert Detweiler assumes his post as the president of Cal State Dominguez 
Hills in Carson next month, he will find a piece of unfinished business on his 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
Detweiler, vice president for academic affairs at Cal State San Bernardino, 
will inherit a lingering debate over the future shape of Dominguez Hills' 
professional health care programs. An advisory committee last year recommended 
that the programs be consolidated into one school. 
</P>
<P>
But that idea is opposed by many in the university's nursing program, which 
moved to the campus in 1987. They fear that their program could lose its 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Schoenwald, who oversees the school's well-regarded prosthetics and 
orthotics program and favors consolidation, thinks that the outcome of the 
debate is important. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'New Directions' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the fundamental question is whether Cal State Dominguez Hills is going 
to create new directions. . . . What we want to do is provide more 
opportunity," Schoenwald said, "and I think we have a greater chance of doing 
it" by combining the programs. 
</P>
<P>
The debate began in 1987, when the chancellor's office decided to locate the 
administrative headquarters for the statewide nursing program at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The highly successful -- and unorthodox -- program, which previously was not 
attached to any campus, has about 3,500 students scattered across California. 
They study at their own pace in classes at various hospitals and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ralph Mills, an assistant vice chancellor for the Cal State 
system, the idea was to give Dominguez Hills, which has about 8,100 students 
and is the smallest Cal State campus in the Los Angeles area, a shot in the 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
However, the chancellor's office placed the program at the school with the 
caveat that Dominguez Hills would integrate the program into the university's 
structure, thus ensuring that the program did not remain without a dean and not 
subject to the same academic procedures of other on-campus programs. 
</P>
<P>
"There was always a fear that because it is such a different program . . . it 
would be isolated," said Lee Kerschner, vice chancellor for academic affairs 
for the Cal State system. 
</P>
<P>
But just how the nursing program should become a part of the university is a 
matter of some dispute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Force of Numbers 
</P>
<P>
Judith Lewis, the program's director, thinks that the vast number of students 
enrolled in the program justifies formation of a separate School of Nursing. No 
other Cal State campus has such a school. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis also contends that the nursing program, which has 12 full-time and 200 
part-time faculty members throughout the state, would forfeit some of its 
autonomy in determining curriculum if forced to become part of a larger school 
with competing departments. 
</P>
<P>
But some faculty and administrators in professional health programs in the 
school's clinical and health departments argue that more benefit would derive 
from combining the nursing program and their programs. 
</P>
<P>
One reason, they say, is that the creation of various programs through the 
years has confused students and faculty about what program is housed in what 
department. They say separating nursing from the two existing departments would 
only add to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Array of Studies 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the health sciences department prepares students to become 
physician assistants or to work in community health and health care management. 
The prosthetics and orthotics program, one of only 10 accredited ones in the 
nation, also is housed in the health sciences department. Another program in 
radiology technology is being developed. 
</P>
<P>
In the clinical sciences department, students are offered programs in cyto, or 
cell, technology, nuclear and human genetic technology. The physician 
technologist program also falls within the department's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
James Welch, head of clinical sciences, said that although he wants to discuss 
formation of a school with Detweiler before making a decision, he earlier 
supported a campus committee's recommendation that a School of Health Care 
Professions be founded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joint Work 
</P>
<P>
One reason he favored the idea was that an academic environment would be 
created where faculty members from the various programs could work jointly to 
attract new teachers and to secure research grants. 
</P>
<P>
"It would also give the university a sort of niche in the marketplace," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Erna Wells, who chairs the Department of Health Sciences, said the department's 
faculty, at the request of the university's interim president, John Brownell, 
studied the issue and decided that it was best to house all the programs, 
including nursing, in one separate school. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty members concluded that if such a school were formed, new programs could 
be developed "in a spirit of cooperation instead of competing with each other," 
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
That is a view shared by Schoenwald, who believes that a new school would 
create a "center of excellence on campus" that would also bring the school 
prestige. "I think the real issue here is what the long-term future of the 
campus is about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brownell, who is retiring at the end of this month, also favors formation of a 
new school. Brownell's recommendation to the chancellor's office to create the 
school was put on hold until a new president could study the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Brownell said he thinks that combining the school's various professional health 
programs would create more interaction among students specializing in different 
fields.

MAN ARRESTED IN FATAL STABBING IN SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Simi Valley man was arrested Thursday on suspicion of stabbing to death a 
fellow tenant in a boardinghouse in an argument over money, the Simi Valley 
Police Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Roni Paz, 32, died during surgery at Simi Valley Adventist Hospital shortly 
after he was stabbed in the abdomen with a 10-inch kitchen knife Wednesday 
night, Detective Sgt. Tony Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said Oscar Garnica, 26, fled after the stabbing but was arrested when he 
returned to the residence in the 1500 block of Sitka Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the night, several other boarders broke up a fight between the two 
men that started inside the house and continued into the street, Harper said. 
Garnica then returned to the house for a knife and stabbed Paz as Paz used a 
garden hose to clean his arms and face, Harper said.

JOYNER PROPELS ANGELS WITH THE SPIRIT OF '86; 
</P>
<P>
HIS SINGLE IN NINTH INNING TOPPLES TIGERS, 4-3, GIVES FINLEY HIS 11TH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was 1986 revisted for the Angels' Wally Joyner on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner lined a two-strike pitch from reliever Mike Henneman into center field 
in the ninth inning, driving in Claudell Washington and giving the Angels a 4-3 
victory over the Detroit Tigers before 26,854 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't swing very well at that first forkball," Joyner said. "I didn't look 
quite as bad on the second pitch. By that time I wasn't as worried about 
protecting the plate as I was thinking about looking really bad and going out 
for the top of the tenth. I just told myself to relax and try to put the ball 
in play." 
</P>
<P>
Tiger center fielder Gary Pettis got to the ball in a hurry and made a strong, 
accurate throw to the plate. Washington decided not to slide and stepped over 
the leg of catcher Mike Heath, barely scoring ahead of the tag. 
</P>
<P>
The run made starter Chuck Finley, who has gone nine innings in four of his 
last five starts, the first Angel left-hander to reach 11 victories since Geoff 
Zahn won 13 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Finley gave up 10 hits, but he also struck out 12 and walked only one to 
improve to 11-6. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, who was hitting only .216 with nine runs batted in in mid-May, also 
drove in the Angels' first run. He has 13 RBIs this month, three more than he 
had in June. He has driven in seven runs in the last six games. 
</P>
<P>
In five at-bats Thursday, he had two singles, a double, a walk and a fly out to 
the warning track in right. His batting average has risen to.297. 
</P>
<P>
"Wally's driving in runs again and they're not just runs, they're large runs," 
Manager Doug Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are guys who drive in runs and they are guys who drive in runs. Guys 
like Tony Perez, who you can count on to drive in the big runs." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Joyner would have settled for any kind of RBI. His 
frustration became so intense that he screamed at hitting instructor Deron 
Johnson, "I'm sick of hitting singles!" 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the situation in the first part of the year where I was playing badly 
and the most frustrating thing was that I wasn't contributing at all," Joyner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've finally turned it around a little bit. Yeah, it feels good to hear the 
cheers and to help us be successful." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels remain in first place in the American League West despite their 
recent road trip, during which they opened with a victory, lost five in a row 
and then finished with a victory. But they Joyner said it was a "good trip." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we played those (five losses) as well as we have any five all year," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels wouldn't have been saying that about this game if it hadn't been for 
Joyner's ninth-inning heroics. 
</P>
<P>
They couldn't score in the sixth -- after loading the bases with one out -- 
when Jack Howell and Dick Schofield struck out. And they failed to score in the 
eighth after the first two batters reached base. Devon White was caught 
stealing and Lance Parrish lined into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can blame (Howell) or (Schofield)," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Tiger starter Doyle) Alexander has worked his way out of tough situations 
like that on many occasions. He's a pro, you have to give him the credit." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, who have the worst record in baseball (33-59), had their share of 
squandered scoring chances. First, Tracy Jones struck out in the eighth after 
Alan Trammell's two-out double off the wall in left. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Pettis struck out -- for the fourth time of the game -- to end the ninth. 
Gary Ward one-hopped a drive into the right-field seats for a ground-rule 
double with one out and then third baseman Howell speared a line drive down the 
line by Rick Schu. 
</P>
<P>
Rader gave Finley the option of pitching to Heath -- who had tripled in Schu to 
tie the game in the seventh -- or walking him to get to the light-hitting 
Pettis. 
</P>
<P>
"My druther was to walk Heath,"Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
But Finley chose to go after the Tiger catcher -- and walked him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him some good pitches but he wouldn't fish for them," Finley said. "It 
came down to me and Pettis." 
</P>
<P>
Five pitches later, the Angels were batting in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took a 1-0 lead in the first when leadoff hitter Schofield walked 
and eventually scored on Joyners' single to center. 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who has never given up a first-inning home run in his 53 major league 
starts, made it through the first again this time around, but Chet Lemon, who 
has seven hits in 10 career at-bats against Finley, lined a two-run shot into 
the seats in left-center in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
The next two batters, Ward and Schu, hit the ball in almost the same spot, only 
not quite as deep. Chili Davis ran down Ward's drive on the warning track, but 
Schu's shot hit the base of the wall for a double. Finley struck out Heath to 
end the inning, however, and seemed to find a groove in the process. He struck 
out six of the next 15 Tigers he faced. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took a 3-2 lead in the third when Washington hit a home run deep 
into the second deck in right. Then Johnny Ray singled to extend his hitting 
streak to nine games and Joyner doubled. Ray scored on Brian Downing's 
groundout. 
</P>
<P>
Finley struck out the first two batters in the seventh, but Schu lined a single 
to right and Heath tripled off the glove of center fielder White to tie the 
score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
That left it up to Joyner, who last month declared that Wally World was closed 
for good. He unlocked the gates for one night, however, and had to admit it was 
just like old times. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Kirk McCaskill threw for 15 minutes before Thursday night's game 
and reported no soreness in his elbow. "As soon as he came in today he said it 
felt 100% better," physical therapist Roger Williams said. "He could tell that 
just from his daily activities. He took his time getting loose, but he was 
throwing pretty good at the end. He's much improved." McCaskill, who received a 
cortisone injection Saturday after being sent home from Baltimore and is also 
taking oral anti-inflammatory medication, will pitch Monday in Oakland after 
missing one scheduled start. "He just had a tired arm," Manager Doug Rader 
said. "I know nobody wants to believe that, but he was just pooped. Sometimes, 
when fatigue sets in, you get disproportionately sore. Kirk is one of the 
reasons we're where we are and, for his benefit and ours, you have to look more 
than five days down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Bob McClure, who had worn uniform No. 37 this season, changed to No. 
33 Thursday. Thirty-seven was the number worn by former Angel pitcher Donnie 
Moore, who died Tuesday after shooting his wife and then turning the gun on 
himself. . . . The last three batters in Angels' lineup Thursday night are the 
team's top three home-run hitters -- Chili Davis (11), Lance Parrish (12) and 
Jack Howell (12). Claudell Washington's shot into the right-field seats in the 
third inning Thursday night was his 10th homer, making him the fourth Angel 
player to reach double figures in home runs. Two others -- Wally Joyner and 
Brian Downing -- have nine each. . . . Umpire Greg Kosc missed the start of 
Thursday night's game after cutting his finger in the afternoon. He received 
stitches at a local hospital and returned in the second inning.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE MAY JUST BE BLOWING SMOKE, BUT FRAZIER LIKES FOREMAN'S 
STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If George Foreman ever gets a shot at Mike Tyson, Joe Frazier predicts he'll 
win. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier told Wallace Matthews of Newsday: "He's got three things going for him. 
He's got the Lord, Jesus and himself. And all three is strong." 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that Tyson is a born-again Christian, Frazier said: "Won't help. He 
got Him too late." 
</P>
<P>
Foreman has said he had a vision after losing to Jimmy Young in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Says TV analyst Ferdie Pacheco, The Fight Doctor: "One Mike Tyson shot to 
George's liver and George will see Christ again." 
</P>
<P>
Add Tyson: Arthur E. Thomas, president of Central State (Ohio) University, 
defending the granting of an honorary degree to Tyson, told the Albany (N.Y.) 
Times Union: "Detractors did not mention Mike Tyson's visit with an 
eight-year-old multiple sclerosis victim who was granted his special wish to 
meet Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"And they did not report that Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack 
Kemp made a special trip to Central State to be with Mike Tyson and to comment 
on his offer to assist in combating urban housing problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Little has been reported about his aiding Father George Clements in Chicago 
when his church burned. Or about his providing food for more than 1,000 
families at Thanksgiving. Or about his being the first to donate $25,000 to the 
foundation established by the family of Sugar Ray Robinson." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the only major league player to win most valuable player 
awards in the same league with two different teams. (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Envelope, please: Bob Hertzel of the Pittsburgh Press, in his bests-and-worsts 
of baseball in 1989, calls Dodger Stadium the prettiest park, with the best 
Diamondvision, and rates Fred Claire the best-dressed general manager with his 
"California casual" look. Then there's the flip side: 
</P>
<P>
Worst interview: "Eddie Murray. If hits were words, he'd still be looking for 
his 200th hit." 
</P>
<P>
Worst stance and swing: "Alfredo Griffin. He can hit, but no one knows how." 
</P>
<P>
Worst ballpark music: "Dodger Stadium. You can't play 'Going Out of My Head' on 
the organ." 
</P>
<P>
Add Hertzel: Here's how he rates the managers: 
</P>
<P>
Best: "Whitey Herzog, Cardinals. No one handles pitchers better." 
</P>
<P>
Worst: "Joe Morgan, Red Sox. Sometimes even he can't explain what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Least approachable: "Tom Kelly, Twins. But then, why would you want to approach 
him?" 
</P>
<P>
Add Cardinals: Reliever Dan Quisenberry, on why he lifts his front foot when 
batting: "Mel Ott did it and it worked for him. Of course, I'm not sure I pick 
up the correct foot." 
</P>
<P>
Head-scratcher: Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe offers this poser: "Will 
Junior Felix next year have to worry about the sophomore jinx?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Jimmie Foxx, Philadelphia Athletics, 1932 and 1933, and Boston 
Red Sox, 1938.

TYSON EXPECTED TO GET STARTED ON '90 TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first big fight of the 1990s should be set up tonight, barring the biggest 
upset of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tyson, undefeated heavyweight champion, figures to make about $20 million 
in early 1990 in a showdown with Evander Holyfield, providing Tyson beats Carl 
(The Truth) Williams tonight in Atlantic City's Convention Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield did his part last week at Lake Tahoe, knocking out Adilson Rodrigues, 
and stretching his unbeaten mark to 22-0. Tyson, who has been anywhere from a 
10-1 to 20-1 favorite to beat Williams tonight, is 36-0. Williams is 22-2. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters would like to hold Tyson-Holyfield early in 1990, with Donald Trump 
owning first refusal rights for his Trump Plaza Hotel in Atlantic City as the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, surly and uncommunicative with the media all week, weighed 219 1/4 at 
Thursday's weigh-in; Williams was 218. Tyson will make $4 million; Williams 
will earn $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In his last appearance here, in June of 1988, Tyson knocked out Michael Spinks 
in 91 seconds. Tyson seemed sloppy and out of control at times in his last 
fight, a fifth-round TKO of England's Frank Bruno in February. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has been seldom seen since a May of 1985, when he boxed competently 
but lost a 15-round Las Vegas decision to then-champion Larry Holmes. His purse 
that night: $175,000. Since then, he has fought only seven times, winning all 
except a TKO loss to Mike Weaver in 1986. He fought on the undercard of 
Tyson-Spinks, but was unimpressive in a 12-round decision over Trevor Berbick. 
</P>
<P>
He's tall (6-foot-4), has a long reach (85 inches), a world-class left jab and 
is one of the better athletes in the heavyweight division. 
</P>
<P>
While Tyson has been skipping the interview sessions and barring reporters from 
his workouts, Williams has been filling notebooks in the press room. 
</P>
<P>
Samples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I want to be a heavyweight champion that a little kid could look up to, 
with a straight face." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I'm not going to let Mike intimidate me, like he does everyone else. Other 
guys get in there and think: 'Oh, wow -- I don't wanna get KO'd . . . this is 
on TV and my girlfriend's watchin'. " 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tyson is the ultimate puncher, and my job is to go into the lion's den and 
take the meat right out of the lion's mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Can he? Williams and Tyson have two common opponents, Holmes and Berbick. 
Williams went the distance with both. Tyson knocked out Holmes in four rounds 
and soundly defeated Berbick. All along, boxing purists have said that Tyson 
will one day lose to a classic boxer, a man who keeps the tiger at bay with a 
long, strong left jab, frustrates him into making foolish mistakes, and then 
knocks him out. The truth, however, is that Williams doesn't appear to be that 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Can he recover, for example, when Tyson hits him on the chin, as he surely 
will? He didn't when Mike Weaver hit him on the chin. In 1986, Weaver knocked 
him down three times in one round and the fight was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was ahead on points at the halfway point against Holmes in 1985, and 
nearly closed one of the champion's eyes with his jab. But Holmes won the last 
three rounds convincingly. Two judges scored it 146-139, and one had it 
143-142. 
</P>
<P>
Said Carmine Graziano, Williams' trainer, of his fighter's chances: "Carl 
should have to check his brains at the door, so it'll be even." 
</P>
<P>
Graziano was only slightly more serious when he said Williams' jab would turn 
the fight around early. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, we concede Mike will get the best of it," he said. "But Carl has 
the best left jab I've ever seen. His jab is poetry. It's so quick, you only 
see it going back. 
</P>
<P>
"By the third round, Carl will be in control. Remember what (Sugar Ray) Leonard 
did to (Roberto) Duran in their second fight? That's what Carl will do to Mike. 
We think Mike is the kind of guy who will not perform well when things aren't 
going his way." 
</P>
<P>
There's only one certain winner tonight, promoter Don King. 
</P>
<P>
If Tyson wins, King will make several million promoting Tyson-Holyfield. But if 
there is an upset, King still wins. 
</P>
<P>
To get this fight, Williams had to grant King options to promote his next three 
fights -- if he wins.

BRITISH LONGSHOT LEADS, BUT YANKS HAVE FIRST LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and Great Britain are long time allies, but that doesn't mean 
there isn't some discord between the English speaking nations once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
The latest flap, minor in the world scheme of things, is developing in the 
British Open golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Irritated by the British press, which has said that the Americans are losing 
prestige in golf at the expense of the Europeans, a Yankee spokesman retaliated 
Thursday after the first round of the tournament at the Royal Troon course. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite, who isn't regarded as a controversial player on the American tour, 
said that his countrymen have been slighted and challenged and will not be 
written off. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Britain's Wayne Stephens led after the opening round with a 
six-under-par 66, the Americans were very much in contention with 14 of them 
under par on another warm, virtually windless day. 
</P>
<P>
Seven players including three Americans, Lee Trevino, Paul Azinger and Fred 
Couples, were grouped at 68, two strokes behind Stephens, a struggling English 
pro, who has tried seven times for his European PGA tour card, losing it three 
times and regaining it twice. 
</P>
<P>
In response to an observation by a British writer that the Americans are making 
a good showing in Scotland, Kite smiled and said: "Isn't that great? Aren't we 
having fun? Aren't you enjoying it, eating those words?" 
</P>
<P>
Kite, who shot a 70, was responding to taunts by the British press that an 
American (Tom Watson) hasn't won the British Open since 1983 and that the 
United States has lost the last two Ryder Cup matches to the European team. 
</P>
<P>
Kite was asked if the Americans' showing was significant. "I think it's very 
significant. There's a strong American contingent over here. I think most of 
the players (41 in all), who are exempt from the U.S. tour, are here with very 
few exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're showing if you want to write us off, go ahead, but you're going to pay 
for it. We're not ready to be written off. I'm not predicting an American 
victory, but there will be very strong scores shot by the Americans this week 
as there will be every other week that Americans are in any other golf 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not dead folks, I promise you." 
</P>
<P>
Kite acknowledged that the Americans are motivated by pride. 
</P>
<P>
"Short of saying you guys (British press) insulted us, there is definitely a 
pride factor. Nobody likes to be written off, especially when they don't think 
they are that bad of players. "I think the bookies are smart. They're in the 
business to make money and they know the Europeans, especially the Brits, want 
to bet on the Brits. They're going to get 3 to 1 odds on a bet against the 
Americans (winning) and they're going to make a killing because the Americans 
are going to play well." 
</P>
<P>
Kite added that 37 Americans are ranked among the top 50 in the Sony rankings, 
emphasizing the strength of the American contingent. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, who shot a 69 and is trying to win the British Open for a record 
equaling sixth time, snapped at a British reporter when questioned about the 
burgeoning rivalry between the Americans and Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're making way too much out of this European-American contest," he 
said. "I'm tired of hearing it. It's an international game. Why haven't the 
Americans won? Well, why didn't the Europeans win for so many years? 
</P>
<P>
"You (British press) jumped all over the the Europeans, writing they didn't 
have heart and stuff like that. It was unfair. And all of these questions about 
the Americans are unfair, too, and I wish you'd stop asking them. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's talk about the players rather than their nationalities. Let's talk about 
the nationalities when we play the Ryder Cup. That's fine. This whole contest 
is getting rather boring to me." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't surprising that a British player is leading on a familiar links course 
after one round. However, one would figure that it would be Nick Faldo, Sandy 
Lyle, or Ian Woosnam. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens, 29, a blond-haired pro with mustache to match, is virtually unknown 
in his own country. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dream come ture," he said. "It hasn't sunk in yet. Hard work does pay 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Stephens, who lives in Jersey, an island off the coast of England, recapped his 
struggling pro career. 
</P>
<P>
"I got my card in 1984, then failed dismally to keep it," he said. "I then 
played regional golf and regained my card in 1987, only to lose it again. 
</P>
<P>
"I regained it last year, my seventh visit to the PGA qualifying school. It has 
been an uphill struggle and things have finally started to go." 
</P>
<P>
Stephens had a bogey-free round, while making six birdies. He finished 
strongly, with birdies on the 15th and 17th holes. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had an exceptionally small gallery when he started his round, only 
his father and a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"After the fifth and seven holes (both birdies) there were a few more following 
me," Stephens said. "Then, after another birdie at seven there were a few more. 
Coming down eleven there was a gathering and I was just trying to wear blinkers 
and not think about it." 
</P>
<P>
It was anticipated that there would be some low scores on the sun-baked course 
with hard fairways and minimal rough because of the lack of rain -- and there 
were. Forty one players were under the par of 72. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino, Azinger and Couples were all in contention with their 68s and so 
is Watson and former UCLA star Steve Pate at 69. 
</P>
<P>
The favored players didn't falter to any extent, either. Curtis Strange, the 
two-time U.S. Open champion, had a 70; Australia's Greg Norman checked in with 
a 69, Faldo had a 71 and defending champion Seve Ballesteros of Spain shot a 
72. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Scottish-born Lyle, who has been in a slump in recent months, shot 
a one-over-par 73, while Woosnam, from Wales, had a 74. 
</P>
<P>
Kite was on the verge of a super round after a 31 on the front nine, five under 
par. 
</P>
<P>
However, he shot 39 on the more demanding back nine, self destructing when he 
made a triple bogey at the par-five 15th hole after he hit his tee shot out of 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Kite can ruefully recall a triple bogey at the fifth hole on the final day of 
the recent U.S. Open, leading to his demise after enjoying a six-stroke lead 
over the field after the third hole. He wound up with a 78, forfeiting the 
championship to Strange. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't upset with his 70 Thursday, though, saying, "It's a good position. 
You can't win the tournament today, only lose it, and I haven't done that." 
</P>
<P>
However, if he and the other Americans don't stay in contention the final three 
rounds, surely the British press will take notice. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Category of making the most of an opportunity: Spain's Miguel-Angel Martin 
learned Tuesday that as a first alternate he could play in the British Open 
because of the withdrawal of American Jay Haas. He then proceeded to shoot a 68 
to join the three Americans, fellow countryman Jose-Maria Olazabal, Argentine 
Eduardo Romero and Australian Wayne Grady two strokes behind leader Wayne 
Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
Although is was a good day for the Americans, it was one Arnold Palmer, who won 
here in 1962, would like to forget. Palmer, 59, struggled in with an 
embarrassing 82, highest in the field, in what could be his final British Open 
appearance. U.S. Amateur champion Eric Meeks of Walnut also struggled, shooting 
an 81.

FIGNON STUNS TOUR FIELD IN ALPS, SOLIDIFIES LEAD

<P>
With only three stages remaining, American Greg LeMond might have to settle for 
a second-place finish in the 76th Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Laurent Fignon has proved remarkably resilient in the Alps, winning 
the 18th stage Thursday with another dramatic uphill charge that defied his 
critics and devastated his pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
Fignon, who has begun to ride with the confidence of a three-time champion, 
which he will become if he is still wearing the leader's yellow jersey after 
the 21st stage, leads LeMond by 50 seconds, a potentially decisive margin. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who in 1986 became the only American champion of cycling's greatest 
race, could reduce that by as much as 30 seconds in the final stage, Sunday's 
15.2-mile individual time trial from the Palace of Versailles to Paris' 
Tuileries Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
But to be in position to win, he probably would have to cut into Fignon's lead 
by 20 seconds or more during the next two stages, a 77.1-mile ride today that 
ends with a descent from the Alps at Aix-les-Bains and a flat 73.3-mile ride 
Saturday to L'Isle d' Abeau. 
</P>
<P>
Such a gain by LeMond doesn't appear likely, however. It was only three days 
ago that Fignon appeared spent, trailing LeMond by 53 seconds entering 
Wednesday's most demanding stage of the 2,030-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
But in the final 2 1/2 miles up l'Alpe d'Huez, a climb so steep that it is 
beyond rating, Fignon, 28, found the strength to pull away from LeMond and his 
other challenger, defending champion Pedro Delgado of Spain. When the day 
ended, Fignon led LeMond by 26 seconds and Delgado by 1:55. 
</P>
<P>
Fignon, 28, was expected to go gently into the 18th stage, protecting his lead 
but also conserving his energy for the final three days. Instead, he attacked. 
His pursuers were stunned as they watched him speed away two miles from the top 
of the Cote de St. Nizier de Moucherotte, 15 miles from the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
No one responded as Fignon won the 56.9-mile stage in 2 hours 31 minutes 28 
seconds. LeMond was in a group of five that finished 24 seconds later. Delgado 
lost another nine seconds, and, while he remained in third place, he is 2:28 
behind Fignon and appears out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Fignon's first in a stage this year. Critics had claimed that 
he depended too much on his powerful Super U team and had not done enough 
individually to deserve the championship ahead of LeMond and Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided before the race to take every opportunity to make up time on 
LeMond," said a relaxed Fignon after Thursday's stage. "I wanted to get as much 
time as possible before (Sunday's) time trial. LeMond is better than me in the 
time trial, but I am better in the mountains. Something could still go wrong, 
but it should be a lot easier now. It's not too much, but it's a nice safety 
margin. Unless there's an accident, there's no way I can lose 50 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Said LeMond after Thursday's stage: "Leave me alone -- leave me in peace." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a television interview, he said: "It will be very difficult to win 
now. The time trial is just too short. I did my best today, but I just wasn't 
strong enough. I'm surprised how strong Fignon is now after being so weak 
before. He deserves to win if he carries on this way. He's having a great 
finish." 
</P>
<P>
Felix Magowan, publisher of VeloNews of Boulder, Colo., said that LeMond might 
now concentrate on maintaining second place. LeMond said when the tour began on 
July 1 that he would be satisfied with a top-20 finish. 
</P>
<P>
Since winning in 1986, LeMond, 28, has been plagued by misfortune, including a 
gunshot wound suffered in a hunting accident that almost took his life, a 
broken wrist, an emergency appendectomy and tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
His results were so poor during the last two years that he lost his contract 
with one of the best teams, PDM of the Netherlands, and is now riding for 
upstart ADR of Belgium. That is not unlike going from the Lakers to the 
Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
"Making up 50 seconds on Fignon would be unbelievable," Magowan said. "If 
LeMond is going to win, he has to do something (today). He has to cut the lead 
in half to be able to realistically come back. He may try something, but the 
problem is that everyone knows he has to try something. They will be watching 
him closely. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect LeMond may give up trying to catch Fignon and settle for second. 
He's going to finish strong in the time trial. To finish second, less than a 
minute behind Fignon, that's phenomenal considering what he's been through the 
last two years. That's like returning from hell." 
</P>
<P>
France's Jeannie Longo won her fourth consecutive stage to increase her lead in 
the women's Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
Longo won the eighth stage, 31 miles from Vizille to Villard-de-Lans in the 
Alps, in 1 hour 43 minutes 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth straight stage, Maria Canins of Italy was second, five seconds 
behind Longo. Susan Elias of the United States was third, six seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Longo has a 7:09 lead over Canins. American Inga Thompson is third, 
10:49 behind.

JIM MURRAY: THIS GUY IS A REAL FOOTBALLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can you imagine a football fan who doesn't know who Joe Montana is? Who never 
heard of Red Grange? Or, the Four Horsemen? Who thinks Notre Dame is a 
cathedral in Paris? Who thinks the Green Bay Packers sell meat? That the Miami 
Dolphins perform at Sea World? 
</P>
<P>
There's about 500 million of them. They have never seen a forward pass or a 
zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
When you say "football" in most parts of the world, you mean it. You are 
talking about a game that is played only with the feet. Our game should be 
"armball." The arm is vastly more important than the foot. The only guy in our 
game who never touches the ball with anything but his feet is the kicker. And, 
he's usually from an island in the Mediterranean, or a fjord in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
American professional football proposes shortly to invade Europe. It is to be 
hoped it has better success importing our football there than they had with 
their football here. 
</P>
<P>
Americans resisted the European game as stoutly as they resisted monocles, 
grand opera, powdered wigs and archdukes. 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever think you'd meet a captain of his football team, one of the best 
players in the country, making 35 grand a year? 
</P>
<P>
Well, meet Rick Davis, midfielder for (a little fanfare music, please, 
professor!) the American national football team, presumably the best 
aggregation of its kind this side of the San Francisco 49ers. Rick can do 
everything in his sport that, oh, say, Brian Bosworth can do in his. But, 
nobody's breaking his door down to get him in deodorant commercials or shoe 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
We call his game "soccer" in the United States, but it's football in the rest 
of the world. The governing body's initials, FIFA, stand for Federation De 
International Football and it makes the National Football League look like a 
branch office. It runs the game in 80 countries worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer is at the crossroads in the United States, Rick Davis admits. It has its 
best chance in the next decade to crack through into the American consciousness 
as a bigtime event. For one thing, the World Cup, soccer's super Super Bowl, is 
coming here in 1994. With television starved for new divertissements, 
soccer/football hopes to rush into the void. The World Cup takes place just as 
the basketball and hockey playoffs are winding up and the game's fondest wish 
is an American team that can be competitive in its playoffs in the hopes 
Americans will take take this legal alien in and assimilate it. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is, the host country gets a pass, an automatic invitation into 
the World Cup in its country. It doesn't have to qualify for 1994. But, the 
American team has to shoot its way into the next World Cup, in Italy in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it is doing nicely, thank you. It is currently leading in the final 
playoffs in the CONCACAF (Confederation of North and Central America and 
Caribbean Assn. Football) qualifying, a five-team final round-robin for the 
final qualifying spots for Rome in '90. An American team has never kicked its 
way into soccer's World Series. The last time it went (Brazil 1950), it got in 
free (invitation). It didn't stay long. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the fact he's not driving a gold-colored Corniche, you'd never be 
able to tell Rick Davis was a football player. Soccer players don't run to 
Brobdingnagian dimensions. Nobody is called "Hoss," or "Bubba," or "The 
Refrigerator." Even the great Pele would have been able to make the 
welterweight limit. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Davis is 5-foot-7, 155 pounds. The Raiders would use him at cornerback. 
But they might not want him. He has no police record, he's never busted up a 
bar, assaulted a motorist or even been caught speeding. But he's tough. You 
have to be to play soccer. There's no padding, no substitution (to speak of, 
you're allowed two a game, even if the starter gets killed). The game is 90 
minutes long and is played on a field just smaller than Rhode Island which 
means you can be in for a 10-mile run in an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Play is continuous. There are no TV timeouts. Although there are supposed to be 
no more than 11 men on a side, the ranks are sometimes swelled by 10,000 for 
one team as the United States found out when it played El Salvador two years 
ago. The spectators got in the act, even throwing Molotov cocktails at the 
Amis. It was nothing personal, the Salvadoreans did it to their compadres, the 
Honduras team, too, to the point the game had to be suspended with four minutes 
to play and the National Guard called in. This has resulted in a temporary 
postponement of the El Salvador-USA World Cup qualifying match. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Davis, who has played for the New York Cosmos and the indoor soccer league 
(St. Louis Steamers, Tacoma Stars) thinks Americans could become a World Cup 
power. There are thousands of Peles in this country, he believes. The trouble 
is, most of them have a basketball or a bat in their hands or are wearing a 
T-shirt that says "Property of USC Football." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 10 and 13 in the Marlboro Cup at the L.A. Coliseum, the American 
national team will get some gauge on how far it has to go when it meets the 
powerhouse Juventus Club from Italy. Juventus is sort of the Chicago Bears of 
European football. Six of its players were on Italy's victorious 1982 World Cup 
team. The winner of USA-Juventus on the 10th will play the winner of 
Mexico-South Korea in the final on the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a proving ground and we'd like to prove we've arrived," said Captain 
Davis. Of course, in soccer, you don't know you've arrived till they start 
throwing Molotov cocktails at you. And you haven't hit the big time till they 
have to build a moat around you and fill it with piranhas.

VALDEZ PITCHES A PERFECT GAME FOR RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Right-hander Rafael Valdez pitched a perfect game Thursday night, the third in 
California League history, as the Riverside Red Wave beat the Reno Silver Sox 
2-0 in a class-A game at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez (10-5) struck out eight. The 21-year-old from the Dominican Republic 
threw three balls to four batters, including a 3-0 count to one. He struck out 
three of those batters and got the other to pop out. 
</P>
<P>
Right fielder Tim McWilliams ended the game with a diving catch of Brian 
Bosco's looping fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams went 4 for 4. The Red Waves scored their runs in the sixth inning on 
consecutive one-out singles by McWilliams, Guillermo Velasquez and Mike 
Humphreys, and a sacrifice fly by Isiah Clark.

DEREK BROWN FAILS SAT, WILL BE INELIGIBLE AT NEBRASKA IN FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Servite High School tailback Derek Brown, the Orange County's single-season 
rushing leader, said Thursday he will attend the University of Nebraska this 
fall but will sit out his freshman year after failing to meet academic 
standards under Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he didn't score the required 700 points on his Scholastic Aptitude 
Test. He said he didn't remember what his score was. 
</P>
<P>
Under National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules, Brown will lose one year of 
eligibility. The NCAA requires incoming freshman to have a 2.0 grade-point 
average and score at least 700 on the SAT or 15 on the American College Test. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'll just study," said Brown, who's practicing with the South team for 
the July 29 Shrine All-Star game in the Rose Bowl. "It's OK. I was a little 
disappointed at first, but it came out for the good. This way I can study and 
get a good jump on my grades. I'll still work out and get ready for next year." 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said Brown will remain on scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"The test scores are a matter of the player's," he said. "That's a private 
matter and I can't comment on it. But he has signed a letter of intent with us, 
and it's our intent (to keep him) with the scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had two Prop. 48s in the last three years. That's not very many. If we 
do have a Prop. 48, we go ahead and put him on scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he will leave for Lincoln, Neb., on Aug. 15 to enroll in classes. 
Nebraska freshmen start football practice Aug. 11 and the varsity Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he was looking forward to his freshman season because he said 
Nebraska coaches told him he might get a chance to play on the varsity as a 
freshman, a rarity at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice to play as a freshman," he said. "But it's no big 
deal. This has worked out better." 
</P>
<P>
Brown was one of the top high school football players in Southern California 
last season, rushing for 2,301 yards in 13 games. He scored 30 touchdowns and 
averaged 8.5 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
He finished his three-year career with 4,663 yards rushing, second on the 
county's all-time list to Valencia's Ray Pallares (5,398 yards). 
</P>
<P>
Brown considered sitting out the Orange County All-Star game in June to go to 
Nebraska to work and train. He changed his mind after attending a banquet for 
the all-star players, then rushed for 121 yards in 27 carries and returned a 
kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne said Brown was among the best high school running backs Nebraska 
recruiters saw this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Derek's a great player," Osborne said. "We rated him high nationally. But it's 
hard to compare him to someone like a (Mike) Rozier or a (Roger) Craig because 
he hasn't played one down of college football yet." 
</P>
<P>
And he'll have to wait another year to do so.

The Nebraska state attorney general is investigating allegations of corruption 
in thoroughbred racing in the state, including hidden ownership of a horse by a 
state racing official. 
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors also have been presented with allegations of irregular 
licensing of convicted felons and selective enforcement of racing rules, a 
former trainer and other sources who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Lee, a member of the Nebraska Racing Commission, said part of the 
investigation focuses on allegations that a staff member of the commission 
concealed ownership of a horse that ran in Nebraska in 1987.

WILL FANS STAND FOR PRO FOOTBALL LEAGUE IN EUROPE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For soccer, rugby and other European games, with crowds of 60,000 and up 
packing London's Wembley Stadium, most fans wedge into the standing-room-only 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
They stand from beginning to end. That is the nature of spectator sports over 
there. 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't an American tradition, and so standing won't be allowed -- except 
when the action brings the fans out of their seats -- when the National 
Football League's new international league cranks up next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Tex Schramm so indicated this week. Schramm is the president of the NFL 
organization billing itself as the World League of American Football, and, in 
his view, what young European sports fans want is the pure NFL product. 
</P>
<P>
"So we'll do our best to give it to them," he said. "We'll have hot dogs, 
cheerleaders, halftime shows, souvenirs, a seat for every spectator, and the 
excitement of American pro football. Europe is ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the most asked questions about the new league. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Will the games begin next spring for sure? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The NFL's club owners, who voted Wednesday to go ahead with the World 
League, left the time-frame decision up to the committee in charge, their 
international league committee, whose members seem to agree with Schramm that a 
1990 start is feasible. Said Schramm: "Certainly we can begin in 1990. That's 
the time to begin." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Which European cities will be represented? 
</P>
<P>
A: London and, probably, Barcelona (Spain), Frankfurt (West Germany) and Milan 
(Italy). "It's the European connection that makes it an exciting league," 
Schramm said. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will California have a team? 
</P>
<P>
A: Plans call for a North American Division with franchises in San Jose, 
Montreal, Mexico City and New Jersey. Probable members of the Southern 
Division: Birmingham, San Antonio, Nashville and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who owns this league? 
</P>
<P>
A: "For the most part, stockholders are the owners of NFL franchises," Schramm 
said. "And the (new) league will own the playing rights to all players, who 
will be allocated to the teams in some sort of draft." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who owns the teams? 
</P>
<P>
A: "The teams will be franchised out like car agencies," Schramm said. "Lining 
up the teams, the franchise holders, the coaches, and good players is the 
easiest part of my job. Everybody wants to either play, coach or own a 
franchise." 
</P>
<P>
Q: When will the teams be named? 
</P>
<P>
A: "In good time, one at a time," Schramm said. "What a new league needs is 
publicity, and what we want is 12 stories, one for each new team, instead of 
one story listing them all." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is the TV industry interested in a league with teams in smaller cities 
instead of NFL cities? 
</P>
<P>
A: "This is a television-driven league," Schramm said. "That's why we're doing 
it. They came to us requesting an annual pro football package for April, May 
and June -- which is a weak time for televised sports, with nothing much on the 
tube. They said the cities, big or little, don't matter. They said that what 
matters is a full house, with the in-person fans enjoying themselves. So we're 
going to give them full houses, with fans enjoying the games." 
</P>
<P>
Q: In Europe, 1990 is a World Cup year. Wouldn't you be better off starting in 
1991? 
</P>
<P>
A: "One of our first jobs is to get European sportswriters and fans interested 
in our football," Schramm said. "So we'll always make sure to play on the night 
before World Cup games. We'll invite everyone to come and compare. We welcome 
the competition."

SHURMUR MOVES KELM TO HEAD OF CLASS FOR RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fritz Shurmur has collected so many notes on defense through the years he 
finally tossed them all in a binder and shipped them off to a publisher. Alas, 
another how-to book was born. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken a fairly simply game and totally screwed it up," said Shurmur, 
author and defensive coordinator for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
It's one of the reasons Shurmur mourned the retirement of linebacker Carl Ekern 
this spring. Imagine a math teacher losing his favorite student. As inside 
linebackers go, Ekern was a relative scarecrow, a milkman's body in a football 
uniform. He lasted 13 seasons in the National Football League by understanding 
that the quickest way to a running back was first knowing where he was running. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur has coached better players than Ekern. Faster and stronger ones. But 
Ekern was Shurmur's favorite by far. He played the game as Shurmur coached it 
from the sidelines. Ekern's game was one of sorting, dissecting, reacting and 
tackling. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur is convinced you need several types of defensive player to succeed -- a 
delicate mixture of brain and brawn. 
</P>
<P>
It was to his delight that Larry Kelm of Texas A&amp;M was available in the 
fourth round in the NFL draft of 1987. Most of the free world had never heard 
of Kelm, but Shurmur knew pretty quickly he'd found the next Carl Ekern. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, he's groomed Kelm for the day Ekern would take his notes and 
retire. That day has come. To give you a clue about Kelm, he spent the 
off-season in Texas obtaining his degree in civil engineering. 
</P>
<P>
That's civil engineering as in three years of calculus and one year of 
something called differential equations. 
</P>
<P>
For reason known only to him, Kelm has always loved math, which may give him a 
leg up in a Rams' defense that gets more complicated by the minute. 
</P>
<P>
Kelm doesn't profess his skills as a mathematician come in handy when Roger 
Craig is barreling through the line with knees flailing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like you can get out a protractor and say, 'If I take this angle on a 
guy who runs the 40 in . . . ,' " Kelm said. 
</P>
<P>
But the discipline needed to learn calculus is the same discipline Kelm devotes 
to studying defenses. Kelm is by no means a wimp. He's 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds 
and could rearrange a nose if the situation called for it. But you need more 
than muscle to run a defense. The game's complexities demand it. 
</P>
<P>
Ekern, who learned those lessons from Jack (Hacksaw) Reynolds, passes the torch 
to Kelm. Ekern has stayed on this season as a volunteer coach. 
</P>
<P>
"In all honesty, I've always been pretty good at math," Ekern said. "Now, if 
you want to equate that to something, you'd be grasping." 
</P>
<P>
But how far? 
</P>
<P>
"It's like studying in school," Ekern explained about learning defense. "You 
can sit there with your book open for as long as you want. But if you're not 
absorbing anything, it's not doing you any good." 
</P>
<P>
Kelm has the ability to sit and absorb. He's spent two years as an apprentice 
under Ekern, following the veteran through his rituals of film-watching and 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"He applies himself," Ekern said of Kelm. "He's got a good grasp of it. I think 
he'll be good at leading a defense." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams certainly hope so. Inside linebacker holds one of the keys to success 
this season. Kelm and Fred Strickland have been asked to replace veterans Ekern 
and Jim Collins, and perhaps Mark Jerue, who's rehabilitating from another knee 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry Kelm filling in for Carl Ekern is a big job," Coach John Robinson said. 
"I think Kelm is one of the most underrated players on this team. But he has to 
do that job." 
</P>
<P>
Kelm is eager to give it a shot, though no one has officially handed him the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting," he said. "There's a feeling of anxiety coming in. I've had 
plenty of time. There's no excuses for me." 
</P>
<P>
Kelm can't help but see a bit of Ekern in himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked that he was consistent," Kelm said. "I can relate that to me. I'm not 
the kind of guy with blazing speed. I'm not a real strong guy. But there was 
the way he studied film, and predicted plays. He was at the right place at the 
right time." 
</P>
<P>
Kelm is also excited at the prospect of being teamed with Strickland, the 
second-year linebacker from Purdue who showed signs of greatness near the end 
of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be fun," he said. "He's an exciting kind of player. He has more 
ability than I do, I must say." 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur said there's a necessity for both kinds of player on a team. He likens 
Kelm's talents to an orchestra conductor. 
</P>
<P>
"He may not play any instrument real well, but he sure can get them to play 
together," Shurmur said. "He has a great ability to put a game together, to 
sort things out. And that's the guy you want in that position." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
With veterans due in Monday and still a lot of paperwork to be done, the Rams 
have scheduled a 3 p.m. meeting today with Steve Feldman, who represents four 
of the team's eight unsigned veterans. The name in the group is tailback Greg 
Bell, but it also includes offensive linemen Duval Love, Tony Slaton and Robert 
Cox. Feldman was making no predictions on Thursday. "Jay (Zygmunt) called me, 
so that's a good sign," he said. . . . Left tackle Irv Pankey is apparently 
headed for another long holdout and his agent says he won't make the upcoming 
trip to Tokyo. In 1986, Pankey missed the Rams' trip to London because of a 
holdout.

PAIN IS GONE FOR MADKINS, BUT SKILLS COMING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was one year ago this coming Tuesday that Gerald Madkins steered a moped 
through the UCLA campus, heading toward Westwood Village to see a movie. 
</P>
<P>
He never made it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he spent the night -- and the next several weeks -- in the UCLA 
Medical Center. Madkins and his moped collided head-on with a car, leaving the 
UCLA basketball player with multiple fractures of his pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
While in the hospital, Madkins wondered if he would walk again, never mind 
dunking in Pauley Pavilion. Would he be able to make it up and down the stairs? 
</P>
<P>
"If you saw his X-rays, you'd look at them and say, 'Oh . . .,' " said Gerald 
Finerman, the Bruins' team physician. "Half of his pelvis was rotated probably 
about 90%. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big-time injury." 
</P>
<P>
But Madkins, whose pelvis was held together for several months by a pair of 
metal plates, seems to have recovered. 
</P>
<P>
He has been playing basketball for several months, focusing his attention on 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
Will he be the same player he was before the injury? 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a good chance," Finerman said. "It's hard to be cavalier and 
say he'll be as good as he was after sitting out a year. But his fracture is 
well-healed. It's in excellent position. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't had much in the way of (pain). We're very hopeful that he'll be able 
to return to his full capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Harrick is hopeful, too, but he wonders about Madkins' mental 
adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
"Your back stops hurting after a year," Harrick said. "Are you going to swing 
the golf club 100%? Are you going to cut loose?" 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, Madkins said. He'll be ready to go when training camp opens on 
Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick rides a moped. 
</P>
<P>
"I take it to the grocery store and places like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So, when he heard that Madkins had been involved in an accident, his first 
thought was that it probably wasn't serious. "I thought he might be a little 
skinned up," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
He soon discovered the worst: Madkins and his passenger, Sheri Carpenter, were 
headed southbound on Circle Drive West at about 25 m.p.h., according to the 
story Madkins told police, when the moped ran head-on into an oncoming car, 
which was traveling at about 10 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
According to the police report, the driver of the car had just moved into the 
area the day before, "was not familiar with (the street)" and "may have been 
partially or totally in the opposing traffic lane." 
</P>
<P>
Physical evidence, the report said, suggested that the moped, which Madkins 
borrowed from teammate Kevin Walker, fell and slid prior to impact, indicating 
that Madkins attempted to maneuver out of harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
Madkins doesn't remember much about the accident, but he told police at the 
scene that he turned his head briefly to say something to Carpenter, then 
turned around to see headlights approaching. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, whose right knee was shattered, doesn't remember anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Gerald calling to say, 'I'll be there in half an hour,' " said 
Carpenter, a high school friend of Madkins' who was visiting from Merced. "The 
next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Madkins remembers a tremendous pain across his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, during a four-hour procedure, Dr. Eric Johnson inserted the metal 
plates to hold the fracture in place. Abdominal muscles, which had been pulled 
away from the bone, were sewn back. One of the plates, which is about eight 
inches long, still runs along the inside of Madkins' pelvis. The other was 
removed last May. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick was dumbstruck by the extent of the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I got sick to my stomach," he said. "I could have cried." 
</P>
<P>
Madkins, who played fewer than 18 minutes a game as UCLA's third guard in the 
1987-88 season but nevertheless was named to the Pacific 10 Conference 
all-freshman team, was projected as a three-year starter. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick considered him the Bruins' best athlete and UCLA trainer Tony Spino, 
who formerly worked for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Assn., 
compared Madkins' court sense to that of former Bucks Sidney Moncrief and 
Junior Bridgeman. 
</P>
<P>
"He sees the floor like nobody we have," Spino said. 
</P>
<P>
With Madkins, Harrick said, UCLA probably would have won about five more games 
last season. As it was, the Bruins were 21-10 and reached the second round of 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament while basically using only 
two guards, Pooh Richardson and freshman Darrick Martin, in the last half of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Madkins plays almost every day at Pauley Pavilion -- without pain, he said -- 
and two nights a week in a summer league at Cal State Los Angeles. Next month, 
he will tour Morocco with a team representing Amateur Sports Development, a 
non-profit group that sponsors cultural tours for amateur athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Madkins practiced with the Bruins at the end of last season and, while limited 
physically, said he developed a greater appreciation for basic fundamentals, 
which he hopes will improve his play. 
</P>
<P>
He admits to being out of shape, but when asked if he is limited in any way by 
the injury, he said: "There's nothing I can't do. I'm going all out. I'm 
falling on the floor. I don't think I'd go out there if I had any hesitation."

Madkins said he plans to be in the starting lineup when UCLA opens the season 
Nov. 25 against Santa Clara. The Bruins' signing of Mitchell Butler, a 6-5 high 
school All-American from Oakwood School in North Hollywood, hasn't changed his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"If he beats me out," Madkins said of Butler, a three-time Southern Section 
player of the year, "it's my fault and I'm going to accept it and sit down. But 
I expect to have the job. 
</P>
<P>
"If Gerald Madkins does what he has to do, he'll be in the starting lineup. 
That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick said Madkins' condition would be a major factor in determining UCLA's 
fate next season. "I have a sixth sense that his ability to come back is going 
to be the key to whether we're good or very good," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-3, 185-pound Madkins averaged under six points a game as a freshman, but 
made almost 60% of his shots, including 45% from three-point range, and 83% of 
his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick described him as a "marvelous athlete," a valued leader and UCLA's best 
defender. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got some skills you can't coach into a guy," Harrick said. "You know, 
instincts that you can't coach into an athlete -- about passing and 
penetrating, and just playing. You can't coach some things. Players are just 
born with them." 
</P>
<P>
Madkins, of course, almost lost those abilities when he skidded across the 
pavement. Since the accident, he said, he has ridden on a moped only once. A 
friend gave him a ride up a hill. 
</P>
<P>
"I was only on there for about 30 seconds, but my girlfriend almost bit my head 
off," he said. "She gave me the weirdest look -- like I was the silliest man 
she'd ever met."

IOWA CRASH IS LATEST CRISIS FOR UNITED CHAIRMAN WOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wednesday's tragic crash of a United DC-10 as it attempted an emergency landing 
in Sioux City, Iowa, is the worst in a string of crises faced by Stephen M. 
Wolf in his short stint as United's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf, who flew to the Iowa farming community Thursday to meet with government 
investigators and comfort injured passengers and crew, has steered the nation's 
second-largest airline through persistent takeover rumors and confrontations 
with its pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Regarded as an airline turnaround expert, Wolf joined United 19 months ago 
after stints at Republic Airlines and Los Angeles-based Tiger International. 
They were both troubled airlines when he arrived, but Wolf cleaned up Republic 
and then Tiger in short order by streamlining route systems and winning 
valuable wage concessions from employees. 
</P>
<P>
He helped sell Republic to Northwest Airlines in 1986 and paved the way for 
Tiger's sale to Federal Express earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The disastrous crash at Sioux City's small airport, which killed more than 100 
people, is the latest challenge for Wolf, a no-nonsense executive known for his 
trademark red suspenders. He evokes strong feelings from his employees. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of admire the guy and am angry at him for sometimes being a jerk," said 
Rick Maguire, chairman of Flying Tiger Line's pilot group. Maguire credited 
Wolf with turning around the airline, which had been losing $76,000 a day when 
Wolf arrived, but said pilots still resent the steep paycuts they accepted 
under pressure from Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have worked with Wolf describe him as a benevolent dictator, one who 
is not afraid to show leadership. On Thursday, he took a 6 a.m. chartered 
flight to the Iowa crash site and later met with Flight 232's crew at their 
hospital bedsides. In a statement, Wolf expressed admiration for the crew and 
pledged United's support for the families of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known what impact the Iowa disaster will have on United. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternating Engine Speed 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board have focused their 
attention on the aircraft's rear General Electric engine. A source close to the 
investigation said it is believed that the rear engine exploded and debris from 
the blowout severed the airliner's hydraulic lines, making it impossible to 
steer. 
</P>
<P>
The crew, according to a source close to the investigation, remarkably guided 
the plane toward the runway by alternating the speeds of the right and left 
engines, in much the same way an oar is shifted from side-to-side to paddle a 
canoe. 
</P>
<P>
When Wolf, 48, arrived at United in December, 1987, the airline was in turmoil. 
The airline's previous chairman had resigned under pressure from its militant 
pilots group and from Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm that 
threatened to seize control. 
</P>
<P>
United's board had already started to trim the company back from a travel 
conglomerate to simply an airline. Wolf quickly helped dispose of the Westin 
Hotel chain and half of the airline's Covia reservation system, raising nearly 
$2 billion. Impatient investors received $2.8 billion in a massive stock 
buyback program. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf worked fast to reduce costs and streamline the airline's route system. 
Unpopular flights, such as a 5:45 a.m. trip from Cleveland to Buffalo, were 
dropped. A program of offering television sets and fur coats to employees as 
rewards for cost-saving suggestions brought results: One suggestion to cut 
radishes out of salads on some flights saved $9,600 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf has also taken steps to expand and modernize United's fleet, among the 
industry's oldest. The airline has recently placed orders and options for more 
than $18 billion worth of aircraft to replace aging domestic aircraft and to 
beef up the airline's already powerful position in the Pacific travel market. 
</P>
<P>
And earlier this week, Wolf said United plans to start flying to seven cities 
in Europe in the next two years, in an effort to transform once-sleepy United 
into a huge global airline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gaining on Competition 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts praise Wolf's accomplishments at United, which is 
starting to slowly regain domestic markets it lost to American Airlines and 
Delta Air Lines -- its chief competitors -- during the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"He took an airline that really had not been focused for some time in terms of 
growth and very quickly repositioned it," said Hans Plickert, an airline 
industry analyst with the Transportation Group in New York. "United has become 
very aggressive in the airline business. There is a hustle and bustle about 
United that has not been there for years." 
</P>
<P>
But Wolf has suffered a number of setbacks, most notably his failure to reach 
agreement with the airline's pilots. There has been no agreement in 14 months 
of contract talks between the pilots union and management. Because there is no 
agreement, the pilots have refused to fly a new Boeing 747-400 delivered to 
United late last month. The pilots union is said to be displeased with the new 
aircraft because it takes only two people to fly it. Most of United's airliners 
have three-man crews. 
</P>
<P>
In another sign of their displeasure, the pilots union said two weeks ago that 
it may revive its bid to acquire the airline and oust Wolf. Such takeover talk 
has pushed up the price of United's shares $11 in the last two weeks. United 
closed on Thursday at $172, down $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
United is thought to be ripe for a takeover because of its valuable Pacific 
route system, labor unrest, its extensive fleet and enormous cash flow. United 
owns 80% of its planes, which have a market value of $3.6 billion. That, and 
the $1 billion cash that United's operations generate, could be used by a 
raider to finance a takeover. Wall Street analysts have estimated that United 
may be worth as much as $270 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Besides takeover threats, Wolf has had to deal with an earlier airline tragedy. 
In February, a cargo door popped open and tore a gaping hole in the side of a 
Boeing 747 as it cruised 22,000 feet over the Pacific near Hawaii. Nine people 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are still investigating the cause of that accident, but the 
inquiry turned up a flaw in United's inspection procedures. Due to what a 
United executive described as a "clerical error," the airline failed to pass on 
a portion of a Federal Aviation Administration safety directive to its 
maintenance crews. The missing paragraph warned crews to inspect cargo doors 
for damage when they are closed manually.

CAR MAKERS CAN'T SEEM TO REVERSE U.S. SALES SLUMP 
</P>

<P>
Hyundai's unsold cars are backing up so badly that officials at the port of 
Portland, Ore., have had to set aside an extra 30 acres to store the imports as 
they arrive from South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, which has been running at full blast for years, has temporarily idled 
small-car assembly plants and laid off workers in New Jersey and Michigan in 
recent weeks because of lagging subcompact sales -- Ford's first significant 
downtime at any of its car plants since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Honda, which has often proved resistant to sales slumps in the past, is now 
burdened by a record level of unsold cars. So it is expanding the incentives it 
pays dealers to clear out excess inventories before the start of the 1990 model 
year this fall. 
</P>
<P>
While analysts continue to wonder just when a slowdown will hit the rest of the 
economy, the guessing is over in the auto industry. The slump is already here. 
</P>
<P>
And so far, nothing the industry has done has reversed the slide. Car sales 
declined 7.6% in the first half of 1989, despite massive rebates and other 
incentives designed to lure buyers back into the nation's showrooms. Sales have 
been down in five out of the first six months of the year, with the industry 
posting a sharp 11.4% drop in June. Even a 9.3% rise in early July sales wasn't 
enough to convince analysts that the industry has turned things around. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Pay-Back Period 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most analysts -- who are now generally forecasting that 1989 sales 
will dip to about 9.9 million units from last year's 10.5 million -- believe 
that the car market is simply exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are going through a pay-back period -- the industry is paying 
back for the strong car and truck sales we've had for the last four or five 
years," says Chris Cedergren, an automotive analyst with J. D. Power &amp; 
Associates, an Agoura Hills automotive market-research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Even light truck sales, which have been buoyant enough to help carry the 
industry in recent years, are finally starting to sag; Ford just announced that 
it will temporarily idle truck plants in Minnesota and Kentucky because of the 
slowdown in compact pickup sales. 
</P>
<P>
The downturn has hit both the importers and Detroit's Big Three; Detroit has 
been forced to cut domestic production, while the Japanese are finding it 
impossible to sell all of the cars they are allowed to ship from home under 
quotas on Japanese car imports. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, some industry observers, noting that the decline has been 
relatively modest on a percentage basis, are not yet convinced that car sales 
are heading for a serious fall. Joel Pitcoff, a sales analyst at Ford, stresses 
that sales have held up relatively well, given the fact that interest rates are 
much higher than they were last year. He adds that a recent decline in key 
rates could even help sales bounce back in the second half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any signs that we're headed off a cliff," Pitcoff says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, what makes the current dip in sales a bigger headache than normal is the 
concurrent expansion in production, both in the United States and overseas. 
That is leading to massive inventories of unsold cars clogging the nation's 
ports and dealer's lots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optimistic Schedules 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese auto makers, for instance, are adding an estimated 600,000 units 
of production capacity in the United States this year alone, as they open or 
expand their new American "transplant" assembly plants. By the end of 1989, the 
Japanese will have the ability to produce more than 1.5 million cars a year in 
the United States -- on top of their imports from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Big Three have tried to adhere to relatively optimistic 
production schedules throughout the year, despite repeated signs of weakness in 
the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
The strong sales of the last few years allowed the market to smoothly absorb 
some excess production. But as soon as sales softened in early 1989, that extra 
capacity started to turn into an enormous burden hanging over the entire 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only now that you can see the impact the transplants are having, because 
before they were expanding into a strong market," notes Ted Sullivan, 
automotive analyst with the WEFA Group, a Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. 
</P>
<P>
The result: A car glut, which is great for consumers but bad for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of good deals available now for car buyers," observes General 
Motors President Robert Stempel. "I think it's marvelous that so many 
(companies) think it's a good investment to build cars in the United States . . 
. from a customer standpoint, that is great news . . . but from an industry 
standpoint, it does make our life tougher." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brutal Marketplace 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the domestic companies, as well as the Japanese and European auto 
makers, have been forced to broaden their rebates and discount financing 
packages in order to generate sales. Incentives available on Japanese cars are 
now the most extensive ever offered, while on the domestic side, Ford and 
General Motors appear locked in a rebate war to see who can undercut the other. 
</P>
<P>
"The marketplace is getting brutal," warns William Pochiluk, the founder of 
Autofacts, a Paoli, Pa., research firm. "These companies are knocking the 
stuffing out of one another." 
</P>
<P>
Without a significant pickup in sales over the next year, many observers expect 
the market to only get tougher. By the end of 1990, the Japanese will have the 
capacity to build even more cars in the United States -- perhaps as many as 1.8 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, GM's long-awaited Saturn small car operation will begin operations 
sometime next year -- bringing another 250,000 units of production onto the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
So the glut could get worse. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody is going to be battening down the hatches for the next 18 
months," says Pochiluk. "Everybody in the industry will be fighting like hell 
for three things -- market share, market share and market share."

U.S. AGENCY FORCED FERRUZZI TO TRIM SOYBEAN HOLDINGS 
</P>

<P>
The Chicago Board of Trade, engaged in a bitter fight with a giant Italian 
agricultural firm over a possible attempt to corner the soybean futures market, 
revealed Thursday that federal regulators had separately ordered the Italian 
company to reduce its soybean contract holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The order caused the loss of millions of dollars for Ferruzzi Finanziaria 
S.p.A., an Italian company that held contracts calling for delivery of 23 
million bushels of soybeans, far more than the actual supply of available 
soybeans in warehouses totaling about 10 million to 12 million bushels. 
</P>
<P>
The company claimed that it was buying big supplies of actual soybeans, and 
contracts for deliveries of millions of bushels more, for use by its Central 
Soya subsidiary, which makes soybean products. 
</P>
<P>
Karsten Mahlmann, the Board of Trade chairman, said Thursday that regulators at 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission decided on the morning of July 11 to 
order a reduction of soybean holdings to 3 million bushels. The action applied 
only to Ferruzzi, which had a special exemption from normal trading limits. 
</P>
<P>
Mahlmann's revelation came as a surprise to the members of the House 
Agriculture conservation and credit subcommittee. Wendy Gramm, the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission chairman, told the subcommittee earlier this week 
that she had been in contact with the Board of Trade during the current 
controversy. But she made no mention of her own agency's moves against 
Ferruzzi's position in soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Hathaway, CFTC spokeswoman, said Thursday that there was no intention to 
mislead. She acknowledged that the agency had revoked one firm's special 
exemption allowing larger than normal trading activity. But she refused to 
confirm that Ferruzzi was the firm mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
"On Tuesday we did not comment on this letter or other actions we had taken 
because the market was still trading," she said. "We feared that disclosing any 
action would have a market effect." Mahlmann testified on the last active day 
for July soybean contracts, after the market had closed, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the soybean futures contract for July dropped 59 cents a bushel 
Thursday, closing at $6.88, 55 cents below the price on July 11, when the Board 
of Trade ordered traders to reduce their contracts to no more than a million 
bushels. In issuing their order, Board of Trade officials presumably feared a 
squeeze in the market by Ferruzzi. Each contract obligates the holder to buy or 
sell 5,000 bushels of soybeans for delivery at a future date. Ferruzzi had 
accumulated a huge position, with contracts to purchase more soybeans than 
actually existed. 
</P>
<P>
Persons who had contracts to sell soybeans would be unable to meet their 
obligations since Ferruzzi held so much of the supply, and presumably would be 
able to dictate the terms of any financial settlement from the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
The board ordered that all soybean traders reduce their holdings to no more 
than a million bushels by Thursday, the date of expiration for the July futures 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Ferruzzi has sued the Board of Trade, arguing that the order to reduce 
contracts changed the trading rules and caused the company big losses by 
driving down the value of a futures contract. Foreign investors were reportedly 
worried that the board's action indicated discrimination against non-American 
players in the volatile commodity futures business. Mahlmann defended the 
board's action in ordering the soybean contract reduction. The step 
"dramatically enhanced the credibility of the board," demonstrating that an 
individual market participant "is not bigger than the market itself," he told a 
news conference after testifying at the congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Both the CFTC and the Board of Trade are watching the August futures market 
with some apprehension. There are open contracts for August delivery of more 
than 80 million bushels of soybeans, compared to supplies of 12 million bushels 
in warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway of the CFTC said: "We are completely aware of the market situation and 
who is in it." She refused to discuss whether Ferruzzi is under restrictions. 
"It is an active market, and we are not able to talk about specific actions," 
she said.

Book Claims GM Approached Honda: General Motors unsuccessfully approached 
Japanese auto maker Honda Motor Co. about a joint venture or merger before GM 
joined forces with Toyota Motor Co. in California, according to a new book on 
the largest American car maker. The book, "Rude Awakening: The Rise, Fall and 
Struggle for Recovery of General Motors" by analyst Maryann Keller, also says 
GM's treasurer suggested three years ago that it would be more prudent for the 
auto maker to settle for 35% of the U.S. car market rather than devote its 
energies to regaining the 45% share it once held. The book is being published 
by William Morrow &amp; Co. and will be available next week.

Large Apple Crop Forecast: Rebounding from bad weather in 1987 and the Alar 
controversy last year, the nation's apple growers are producing the 
second-largest crop in history, according to the Agriculture Department. USDA 
said the nation's 20,000 growers will harvest 230.8 million 42-pound boxes of 
apples this fall, about 5% more than last year's 218 million boxes. Prices and 
sales in 1988 were lower because of the Alar scare. The 1989 forecast is well 
below the 1987 record crop of 255.9 million boxes, which suffered extensive 
weather damage and brought prices below the cost of production.

Japanese Firm Stops Making Black Doll: A Japanese toy maker said it will stop 
selling a black inflatable doll with big round eyes and a grass skirt, but the 
company denied it was acting because critics called the doll racist. Shusuke 
Kubota, a spokesman for Takara Co., said it also was discontinuing the use of 
the doll, named "Dakko-chan," as its corporate symbol. Takara also makes 
"Transformer" robots that can be bent and twisted into other objects. Kubota 
said Takara's decision to discontinue "Dakko-chan" had no connection with 
racial issues. "It's not a black. It represents a Japanese child whose skin has 
darkened from being out in the sun all summer long," he said.

DOW SLUMPS 8.92 AFTER MORNING RALLY FIZZLES

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sudden selloff near the close pushed stock prices lower Thursday, wiping out 
an early gain that carried the Dow Jones industrial index briefly past 2,600 
for the first time since the fall of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow index, up about 30 points at its mid-session peak, closed with an 8.92 
loss at 2,575.49. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 204.59 million shares, against 
215.74 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the late decline stemmed in part from selling by professional 
traders engaged in computer program strategies involving options and index 
futures contracts, some of which expire after the close today. 
</P>
<P>
They also said investors seemed to back away from an initially enthusiastic 
response to testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, 
before the House Banking Committee on the Fed's credit policies. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the central bank had taken note of a slowing in the pace of 
economic activity, and was seeking to avoid "an unnecessary and destructive 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
However, he also noted that inflation remained clearly above where the Fed 
would like to see it. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said Greenspan's comments squared with the recent belief that the Fed 
was proceeding gradually to try to steer the economy toward a "soft landing" 
that could set the stage for renewed growth. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph led the NYSE active list and rose 1/4 to 37 
1/8. The company reported second-quarter earnings of 65 cents a share, up from 
55 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down 1/2 at 55 3/4; 
Procter &amp; Gamble, down 7/8 at 116 1/4; Philip Morris, down 1/2 at 146 1/2; 
USX, down 1/4 at 35 5/8, and International Business Machines, down 1 5/8 at 112 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, share prices rose as investors who had been waiting to buy on 
expected declines after Japan's election Sunday decided to move in early. The 
key Nikkei 225-share index rose 107.70 to close at 33,664.87. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices ended slightly lower on the London Stock Exchange. The Financial 
Times 100-share index fell 0.2 points to 2,292.3. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders welcomed Greenspan's hint of lower interest rates and sent bond 
prices modestly higher in an up-and-down session. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the day's gains were eliminated by a late-afternoon slide in prices 
that appeared to result from internal market workings rather than any fresh 
negative news. 
</P>
<P>
Most bond prices rose about 1/8 point for the day, although the Treasury's 
benchmark 30-year bond finished unchanged in price. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction from its price, stayed at 8.13%, the same as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.188%, unchanged from late Wednesday, indicating that the Fed was not 
taking any immediate steps to ease credit. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar lost ground in quiet domestic trading after closing mixed overseas 
as dealers digested Greenspan's comments on the climate for interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices closed mostly higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold 
bullion for current delivery finished at $371.40 an ounce, up from $368.30 on 
Wednesday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $370.85 at 4 p.m. 
EDT, higher than Wednesday's $368.20. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers worldwide monitored the Fed chairman's semiannual report to Congress, 
but few came away with any clear indication of where interest rates might be 
headed. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 142.33 Japanese yen from 141.80. In London, the 
dollar closed lower at 141.45 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 141.40 
yen, down from 142.50 yen. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.6273 late Thursday, more expensive for 
buyers than Wednesday's late $1.6195. In New York, it cost $1.6230 to buy one 
pound, more expensive than $1.6127 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Pork belly futures prices soared by as much as 2 cents a pound, the permitted 
daily limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, on signs that lower bacon 
prices may finally be stimulating demand for the sizeable supplies of pork 
bellies in cold storage. 
</P>
<P>
Hog futures prices also rose while cattle futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, orange juice futures fell sharply for the fifth straight day; 
grains and soybeans finished mixed as the July contracts expired; precious 
metals erased some of Wednesday's losses, and energy futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen pork bellies settled 1.53 to 2 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in July at 30.55 cents a pound; hogs were 0.03 cent lower to 0.98 cent 
higher, with July at 49 cents a pound; live cattle were unchanged to 0.20 cent 
higher, with August at 72.75 cents a pound, and feeder cattle were 0.22 cent 
lower to 0.07 cent higher, with August at 83.72 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The pork belly market turned in its strongest performance in more than six 
weeks in a delayed response to Tuesday's weekly exchange report on pork belly 
stocks in U.S. commercial freezers outside of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The report showed a net out-movement of nearly 5.4 million pounds last week, 
compared to 3.9 million pounds for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Orange juice futures prices fell the 5-cents-a-pound daily limit on the New 
York Cotton Exchange on perceptions that large supplies of Brazilian juice will 
soon hit the market. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 3.25 to 5 cents lower, with September 
at $1.546 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures prices closed higher while corn and soybean futures finished 
mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade, where much attention was focused on 
the expiration of the July soybean contract. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in soybeans for July delivery ended at 12:01 p.m. Central Daylight time 
after a spurt of selling that pushed the contract's price down to $6.885 a 
bushel, 39 cents below Wednesday's settlement price.

Schlumberger Ltd.: The New York-based oil service company said profit dropped 
12% to $126.8 million in the second quarter. The drop in net income resulted 
from the company's repurchasing of $1.2 billion in stock last year, the company 
said, causing a $35-million drop in earned interest. Revenue was down 5% to 
$1.196 billion.

TELEPHONE FIRMS RING UP MIXED PROFITS IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Fueled by continued strong growth in its long-distance telephone business, 
AT&amp;T's profits rose 17.7% in the second quarter, the company reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings results were mixed, however, among the trio of so-called Baby Bell 
local phone companies that also reported financial results. San Francisco-based 
Pacific Telesis, parent of Pacific Bell, said its profits rose a scant 1.2% 
mainly because of vigorous growth in its cellular phone business. Meanwhile, 
Southwestern Bell in St. Louis said its earnings rose 22.8% while profits 
dropped 13.6% at Nynex in White Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T 
</P>
<P>
For American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which had written off old equipment and 
taken a $1.67-billion loss last year, the news was all good. "By and large they 
were excellent results," said Charles Nichols, an analyst with Bear, Stearns 
&amp; Co. "They're making progress on the revenue side at the same time they're 
improving (profit) margins." 
</P>
<P>
For the quarter ended June 30, net income was $699 million despite a 
$96-million charge due to depreciation changes and the declining value of old 
telecommunications gear. Revenue increased 5.2% to $9.26 billion, with 
long-distance revenue growing 7%. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Robert E. Allen attributed the showing to AT&amp;T's having made 
"definite progress toward our objective of achieving business growth in tandem 
with expense control." 
</P>
<P>
Allen credited, among other things, the company's expanded sales force. Last 
year, 2,000 staff employees were shifted to sales, and another 3,000 workers 
will still be redeployed. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T said product sales increased 4%, largely due to improved sales of 
telecommunications abroad, including a first-ever, $154-million contract to 
provide optical communications gear to Japan's Nippon Telegraph &amp; 
Telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good fundamental quarter," said Gregory Sawers of Sanford C. Bernstein 
&amp; Co. "I read it that they're stabilizing market share. They're still 
growing less than the industry level, but they're improving." 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T's biggest rivals in the long-distance business -- MCI Communications 
and U S Sprint -- earlier this week reported that their results improved 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis 
</P>
<P>
For Pacific Telesis, net quarterly income rose 1.2% to $325 million on revenue 
of $2.41 billion, up 1.7%. Chief Executive Sam Ginn attributed Pacific Telesis' 
modest gain to "the improving performance of our cellular business," where 
sales increased by 51.3% to $111.5 million and profits more than tripled to 
$13.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Results were flat, however, in the company's local phone business in California 
and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
In the stock market Thursday, AT&amp;T shares closed at $57.25, up 25 cents; 
Pacific Telesis finished at $43, off 87.5 cents; Southwestern Bell dropped 
$1.125 to $53.625, and Nynex fell $1.375 to $78.25.

Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing: The diversified St. Paul, Minn.-based 
company said earnings rose 5.5% to $327 million in the second quarter. Revenue 
was $3.025 billion, up from $2.903 billion in the year-ago period. The 
manufacturer of industrial, commercial, health-care and consumer products noted 
that international operations posted double-digit unit-volume growth and that 
the information and imaging technologies sector achieved sharp profit gains 
worldwide. Overall results were affected by a weaker domestic economy and the 
stronger U.S. dollar.

INVESTOR GROUP SAYS IT MAY TRY TO BUY USAIR;

AIRLINE STRENGTHENED ITS 'POISON PILL' TAKEOVER DEFENSE LAST MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group led by Michael H. Steinhardt, an aggressive New York money manager, 
said Thursday that it owns more than 5% of USAir Group and may try to acquire 
the nation's fifth-largest airline. 
</P>
<P>
USAir's shares rose $2.125 on news of the possible takeover attempt, closing at 
$49.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. A USAir spokesman would not comment on 
Steinhardt's action. 
</P>
<P>
Steinhardt, 48, runs one of the most respected private investment firms on Wall 
Street and manages a $1.3-billion portfolio. He is known for his quick trading, 
often buying a stock in the morning and selling it for a profit hours later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Moved Before 
</P>
<P>
Steinhardt said in a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that his group had raised its stake in USAir to 5.89% from 4.44%. 
The group now holds 2.5 million shares worth about $129 million. The Steinhardt 
group acquired its latest 546,900 shares at prices ranging from about $45.73 to 
$47.60. 
</P>
<P>
Steinhardt, through his Steinhardt Partners and its affiliates, has taken 
positions in other airline companies before but has never moved to acquire one. 
</P>
<P>
Takeover rumors have swirled around the airline industry since Los Angeles 
investor Alfred A. Checchi's winning $4.05-billion bid last month for NWA Inc., 
the parent of Northwest Airlines. Checchi's $121-a-share tender offer expires 
today. 
</P>
<P>
As a defense against an unwanted suitor, USAir last month strengthened its 
"poison pill" anti-takeover plan. 
</P>
<P>
USAir itself has been active in the takeover game, buying both Piedmont 
Airlines and Pacific Southwest Airlines in 1987. Its operational merger with 
Piedmont becomes official on Aug. 5.

JUDGE PERMITS EASTERN TO TAP ITS ESCROW FUND

<P>
A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday approved the release of $75 million from 
an escrow fund to help strikebound Eastern Airlines with its financial needs in 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern initially had asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland for the 
release of $100 million from creditors, while a committee representing 
Eastern's major creditors asked for only $40 million to be released. 
</P>
<P>
However, the parties agreed to the $75-million figure and the judge approved 
it, with the understanding Eastern could request additional money from the 
escrow fund, which contains money from asset sales. 
</P>
<P>
Miami-based Eastern said it expected to file its reorganization plan today, 
centering on emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and rebuilding as a 
smaller carrier.

ROMANTIC CAPITAL LACKING FOR COUPLE ON DREAM DATE 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The young man and woman sit side by side in the romantic rooftop lounge atop 
the Hotel Washington. It is their first trip to Washington. The sun is about to 
set on this clear summer evening. But what's most clear is that there's more 
fizzle in the 7-Up she's sipping than there is between this couple. 
</P>
<P>
This is a match in desperate need of a few electrons. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that they dislike each other. "He's fine," she says of the dream date 
she chose on the "All New Dating Game." 
</P>
<P>
It's just that romance seems as likely to ensue on this July night as a 
snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
"What time do the clubs close?" asks Jay Polk, 22, a sophomore at USC who is 
determined to have a grand time on this Friday night and the rest of the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Party, party, party!" says Tisha Cruse, 18, rolling her eyes and giving off 
"You touch me, you die" vibes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have four days here to set a record," says Jay, the former Bachelor No. 2 
who won Tisha's heart by saying something about having a nice car. "I want to 
go home and tell my friends I tore up D.C. Look for me on the 6 o'clock news!" 
</P>
<P>
Tisha shakes her head. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sweet and Proper 
</P>
<P>
Chaperon Fran Bisharat, a sweet and proper 57-year-old woman who's seen much of 
the world as a professional "Dating Game" fifth wheel, has little to worry 
about with this couple as far as what the show calls "morality." 
</P>
<P>
"The big question?" says "Dating Game" promotions director LeeAnn Platner, 
referring to the vast interest in their couples' sleeping arrangements. "That's 
not something we have a hard time with. Couples usually never want to stay 
together. We figure we're doing well if we get them through the weekend and 
they're still speaking to each other. Usually, by the end of four days, 
everyone is sitting in a different part of the plane, saying, 'Give me a 
headset and leave me alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me about this club again," an effervescent Jay says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired. I wanna go to bed," his date says. 
</P>
<P>
They decide to change clothes before hitting the town for dinner and dancing on 
this Friday night, the first night of their four-day "dream date." 
</P>
<P>
Tisha has been given Room 806, a glorious suite with a walk-in cedar closet 
where her clothes -- all black and white -- are hanging. 
</P>
<P>
She is a petite, attractive student from the San Fernando Valley who wants to 
be an actress and an attorney and plans to attend a California university and 
study English in the fall. Last year she went on another game show, "Triple 
Threat," and won $4,200. This time she won a weekend with Jay. 
</P>
<P>
Is true love in the cards? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no. I have a boyfriend," she says matter-of-factly while curling her hair. 
She describes her boyfriend, Chuck, as "big and buff" and says Jay doesn't know 
about Chuck. Chuck, for his part, isn't worried about the date with Jay because 
"he saw the show on TV," Tisha says. "He thinks Jay's a nerd. He knows he's not 
my type. Jay is kind of loud. I kind of like more quiet guys. But they can't be 
boring." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called for Audition 
</P>
<P>
Tisha and her drama class were in the audience of "The Newlywed Game" when 
members of the audience were asked to sign up for "The All New Dating Game." 
Tisha was later called in for an audition. "You have to act peppy and exciting 
and make small talk. They don't want boring people." On March 23, she taped the 
show that aired in May. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really paying that much attention to the guys," she recalls. After 
all, here she was on national television -- and she does want to be an actress. 
So she's chatting away, laughing with the audience, flirting with "Dating Game" 
host Jeff MacGregor, when it's time to choose a bachelor for her dream date. 
</P>
<P>
She chooses Bachelor No. 2, Jay Polk, 22, of Los Angeles. He's kind of cute 
with his flat-top haircut and tiny stud earring and bright smile. Very well 
dressed in baggy pants and a rayon shirt. Not bad, she's thinking. But then he 
starts dancing and acting goofy and she's thinking, "Ooooh myyyy God." 
</P>
<P>
"They were all nerds," she says. "I did not have any good choices at all. I was 
mad." 
</P>
<P>
But Tisha, who had just turned 18, would be off to beautiful historic 
Washington, D.C., for a four-day all-expense paid trip with chaperon -- and 
with Jay Polk. 
</P>
<P>
Jay went on the "Dating Game" looking for "adventure, TV exposure, something 
different" and a free summer vacation. He has friends in the Washington area 
and hopes to hook up with them. But more than anything, he's just after a good 
time. "When I die, I want to be able to say to God, 'It was a bad last day, 
Jack!' And he's gonna say, 'Jay, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Sit down and tell me 
about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
But right now, they'd all like to sit down to dinner. The trio takes a subway 
out to a Southwestern restaurant where the owner gives them dinner on the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Talk is a little strained at first, but Fran, a laid-back California type, wife 
of a retired physician and mother of four grown children, does her best to draw 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
Soon they're talking goals and relationships and even homelessness and abortion 
-- "I'm a deep issues person," Jay says -- when a customer stops by the booth. 
"You guys won the 'Dating Game'? Do you know Monty Hall?" 
</P>
<P>
Tisha's eager to leave, so they skip dessert. After a silent cab drive to a 
dark and funky New York-style nightclub, the couple hits the dance floor. Fran 
stands to the side, holding Tisha's pocketbook, as women in black leather 
bustiers and men with green hair walk by and a video of amoeba-like cells and 
organisms plays on a big screen. 
</P>
<P>
Jay is unenthused with the "house music" so, by midnight, they're heading back 
to the hotel. Tisha and Jay end the first night of their dream date by watching 
"Major League" on pay TV in his room. But no, he doesn't get to first base. 
Tisha nearly falls asleep and walks zombie-like back to her room. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 a.m. Jay gets a call from Nichelle, his knock-out girlfriend who lives in 
New York. She's taking a train down. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, they take a sightseeing tour of Washington, all four of them. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were Tisha, I might be a little mad," Fran says of the surprise arrival. 
Jay and Nichelle, after all, are walking up the Lincoln Memorial steps 
hand-in-hand. Jay offers his other hand to Tisha, but she politely declines. 
</P>
<P>
The truth of it, however, is that Tisha is relieved. "I didn't want him to put 
the moves on me." 
</P>
<P>
So if Tisha is happy, and Jay is happy, then Fran is happy. That's the 
chaperon's goal, after all, to keep the couple smiling. She does what they want 
to do, when they want to do it. But she's the meal ticket, the bank. If either 
of them goes off on their own, the "Dating Game" no longer foots the bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Smashing Success 
</P>
<P>
Romance or not, this date has turned out to be a smashing success, Fran 
believes. To her delight, their dinner conversations have been substantive -- 
more talk of abortion, as well as discussions of interracial dating, poverty, 
religion, politics. 
</P>
<P>
Nichelle heads back to New York Sunday morning, leaving the original trio to 
see a film, discuss it, and end their weekend Monday afternoon just as it began 
-- with drinks at the hotel's rooftop terrace. There still aren't any sparks 
flying. But now there's friendship. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going to be really rough," Jay says. "At first Tisha was more 
along the lines of 'I don't know him so I'm not going to talk to him.' " But 
they both warmed up. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going to be real bad," Tisha says, "but it was nice." 
Washington turned out to be "rad." Jay turned out to be a pretty intelligent 
and funny guy. And when they flew back home -- sitting together -- they didn't 
even ask for headsets.

THE LITHE AND LEAN LEOTARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE SEIPP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you haven't been to aerobics class in a while, you may be in for a shock. 
Get ready for a close encounter with a G-string leotard, most likely being worn 
by the woman in front of you, and most certainly revealed to the fullest effect 
when the bend-over exercises begin. 
</P>
<P>
Like the thong bikini that preceded it -- seen first on Brazilian beaches 
several summers ago -- the look-as-leotard is reasonably demure in front, but 
barely there in back. And it's by far the most popular aerobic exercise fashion 
silhouette of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably about 70%-80% of women in class are wearing them now," says Karen 
LeCourt, aerobics manager of the Sports Connection clubs in Manhattan Beach and 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The racy shape has become so accepted that a more conservative model, being 
offered by some designers, rates a distant second in sales. "The semi-thong is 
wavering; I don't think it's going to last," says Bev Ebe, who represents Ko-fe 
and Gotta Have It, two popular dancewear collections. "Full fanny people aren't 
going to wear it at all. And once the others get used to the thong, why would 
they go back to a wider bottom?" 
</P>
<P>
Some observers say it looks uncomfortable to wear. But enthusiasts swear the 
style is actually more comfortable than traditional leotards that tend to ride 
up the legs during workouts. Ballet dancers for whom leotards were first 
invented have long been rolling theirs up to imitate thongs, in order to make 
exercising easier. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt they could lift their legs up better with the leotard out of the 
way," explains Joyce Stevens, owner of Karabel Dancewear. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens' several Fairfax-area shops have been popular with professional dancers 
and exercise instructors for two decades. Lately, a lot of them buy thongs as 
wardrobe for rock videos and cable TV shows, but not for regular TV yet. 
They're considered too revealing for prime time, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Most women wear a thong leotard over cotton Spandex tights or bicycle shorts. 
And many designers consider it more flattering than the thong bikini against 
bare skin. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a better look than being naked, that's for sure," says dancewear 
designer Gilda Marx about the thong- tights combination. 
</P>
<P>
For less than perfect legs, LeCourt points out, dark colors create a slimming 
effect. And the high cut makes all types of legs look longer. 
</P>
<P>
Like so much else in body-revealing fashion, the thong is most attractive on 
women who have worked off every extra inch from their hips and toned their 
gluteus maximus muscles -- glutes, as aerobic instructors call them. But 
LeCourt argues that women with less than perfect figures who want to wear the 
look should do so.

HALSTON; 
</P>
<P>
MADE-TO-ORDER COLLECTION REFLECTS SPIRIT OF THE FAMILIAR NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The glass-and-mirror showroom with views of St. Patrick's Cathedral and the 
Empire State Building looks much the same. So do the oxblood carpets and 
modular furniture. And the bouquets are as large and extravagant as always. 
</P>
<P>
But Halston doesn't live here anymore. Or more precisely, work here, even 
though a collection of custom-made clothes with his name on the label was 
recently presented in the showroom. 
</P>
<P>
The designer vacated the place some five years ago while in the midst of 
complicated legal negotiations about the Halston moniker. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Revlon Inc. purchased the Halston name and now, in an attempt to 
revive interest in the label for possible new licensing ventures, Revlon is 
presenting a 70-piece Halston made-to-order collection, still without Halston's 
involvement. Rumors are that the designer is in ill health. 
</P>
<P>
The clothes are the work of a team including John David Ridge, the company's 
vice president of design services; Bert Keeter (he worked for Holly Harp as a 
designer in 1979 and also had his own label in Los Angeles for a time); Chris 
Royer, creative marketing director and director of accessories (and a former 
Halstonette, the nickname given to the models who did Halston's shows and 
personified his look in the '70s), and Salvatore Marano, who was the head 
tailor in Halston's workroom for years. 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that such a team has come up with a collection that 
reflects the spirit of Halston's classic, spare and elegant designs -- the 
bias-cut day and evening dresses, supple cashmeres, double-faced coats devoid 
of extraneous details and cowl-necked pajama ensembles that Halston's loyal, 
legendary client, the late Babe Paley, used to wear. 
</P>
<P>
There is also lots of signature Halston red in the collection (he once posed 
for a People magazine cover with acolytes Liza Minnelli and Elizabeth Taylor 
both wearing red ensembles). And there is an Oriental simplicity to many 
designs accented with obi-like wrapped waists. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically wanted to emphasize what Halston was about -- his theories of 
exquisite fabrics and simple but also complicated cuts," Keeter says. "It's a 
very, very pared-down look with very subdued details and in the Halston classic 
colors, true colors like deep purple, fuchsia and fire-engine red." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if any of Halston's old patterns were brought out of mothballs, Keeter 
says it wasn't necessary. "We have a pretty good idea of the look, and we 
wanted the collection to be younger and to go one step further." 
</P>
<P>
Standout looks in the line, which sells for $1,500 to $20,000: the red silk and 
Angora dress draped across the bodice and with matching stole; the taupe 
cashmere day suit with long-point collar; the dazzling red-and-black 
hand-painted georgette dress with sequin embroidery, and for glamour girls, the 
black silk-satin coat lined in pink satin and edged in black fox over a 
bias-cut gown. 
</P>
<P>
Halston once said: "What makes a designer famous is that his clothes are 
recognizable. They don't look like someone else's. That's what makes you famous 
-- your signature." 
</P>
<P>
The question now: Does the signature work when it's in someone else's 
handwriting? 
</P>

CRYSTAL MAIL IS LATEST FORM OF FANTASY; 
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL SCHMIDT DRAWS INSPIRATION FROM JEWELRY DESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARIO SCARDAPANE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people who know his name think of Michael Schmidt as the man who designed 
the chain-mail clothes that Cher wore in those health spa ads. Now Schmidt is 
making a few additional items for her wardrobe. This time he's using a 
technique he calls "New Age knitting." 
</P>
<P>
He weaves crystals, connected by tiny metal links, into a delicate latticework 
fabric he refers to as crystal chain mail. He is working the unusual fabric 
into minidresses, T-shirts and motorcycle jacket trims for Cher, hoping she 
will bring the clothes to widespread attention when she wears them to 
premieres, award ceremonies and for the occasional Holiday Health Spa ad. 
(Schmidt designed the chain-mail top she wore in last year's high-profile ad 
campaign.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see her take it and run with it, the way she has with other 
designs of mine," Schmidt says of his crystal clothing collection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uses Past Experience 
</P>
<P>
These new styles, like his earlier, all-metal chain-mail outfits worn by 
celebrities Diana Ross, Elton John and the rocker Ozzy Osbourne, are inspired 
by jewelry more than by fashion, he says. "I used to do crystal jewelry a long 
time ago, and as a result of working with crystals, I came up with this 
concept." 
</P>
<P>
At that point in his fledgling career he didn't have the cash to produce his 
crystal-mail fashion fantasies. The materials were too expensive for his 
limited budget, and he couldn't afford to hire the specialized workers he 
needed. "It's more fine art than fashion," he says about the hand-done 
technique. "You'd think it wouldn't work for clothes but it does." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt's new knits have an appeal based on contrasts. "They're incredibly 
refined and also have an aggressive, hard quality," he says. "Adapting harsh 
material to the softness of the human body makes the clothes interesting." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrity Client 
</P>
<P>
Cher is the designer's celebrity client of choice. "Cher's the perfect 
spokeswoman and model for my work because she embodies glamour and street 
credibility," he says. But others can also find his styles at the Maxfield 
boutique. 
</P>
<P>
His future fashion-design plans reinforce his way of combining two optional 
elements of style: flashiness and originality. Upcoming are motorcycle jackets 
constructed of crocodile skin (Schmidt's homage to Yves Saint Laurent, who did 
a version of the look in the mid-'60s). He is also working on T-shirts, dresses 
and jackets made of gossamer strands of metal that he calls "stainless-steel 
chiffon."

HIGH-TECH POLICE WORK;

TAKING A BYTE OUT OF CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day a still-hobbling Ken Delong returned to the Los Angeles police force 
after the horseback riding accident that almost claimed his life, a computer 
was waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Larry Kramer was pointing at the thing. 
</P>
<P>
"You shall," Kramer told him. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No I won't. I'm a detective,' " Delong recalled. "And he said, 
'You're stuck inside anyway. We need a computerized gang system.' " 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Detective Ken Delong's computer has a file on each of the 
30,000 alleged gang members known to Los Angeles police. Now he is working on 
their photographs. In a month or two, if a witness to a drive-by shooting 
overhears one gunman calling another "Smokey," a computer will pull up images 
of Crips and Bloods named Smokey. "You'll have them in 10 seconds," a proud 
Delong said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Computer Age 
</P>
<P>
So it is that many law enforcement agencies are moving further into the 
computer age -- a bit reluctantly at first, and a few years behind private 
industry, but with unmistakable momentum. 
</P>
<P>
It's happening despite tight budgets and natural resistance to high technology 
in a field where "everybody was hired to be a cop, a gunslinger," in the words 
of Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
It's happening because a variety of high-tech tools have proven that they can 
make police work more effective, because private industry sees a promising new 
market and because many departments spawn converts such as Delong, who push for 
new gadgets from the inside. 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department, it's Undersheriff James 
Vizzolini, a self-styled "technology rat" who has computerized systems for 
dispatching squad cars, booking inmates into the jail and processing arrest 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, Cmdr. Gary Bennett supervised the traffic squad that became the 
second in the nation to use a Swiss-made photo-radar system to catch speeders, 
even though it was certain to draw challenges from motorists and defense 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Behind the Private Sector' 
</P>
<P>
"It seems ironic to talk about taking risks when you're a police department," 
Bennett said, "but when it comes to using new technology, I think we're behind 
the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
And in Morgan Hill, a city of 24,000 south of San Jose, the impetus behind new 
technology was a whiz kid officer named Alec Gagne. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, at age 21, Gagne decided it was a waste of time to have to search 
through 3-by-5-inch index cards to get basic information on a vehicle that may 
have been used in a crime. Five years and four state grants later, Morgan 
Hill's patrol cars have computers that would be the envy of the nation's 
largest police forces; they can even display photographs of suspects 
transmitted from headquarters -- something Delong's computer in Los Angeles 
doesn't do yet. 
</P>
<P>
Today's new product is likely to involve a computer of some sort: hand-held 
ones that spit out traffic tickets; million-dollar systems that track stolen 
cars, and computer programs that detect crime patterns and help detectives 
predict where a bank robber may strike next. 
</P>
<P>
But for top police officials, seeing does not necessarily mean believing -- or 
buying. Sheriff Block, for instance, remembers very well one very low-tech 
purchase. "Our people still carry the capture net," he said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
The $500 nets, which are weighted at the edges, made sense to many law 
enforcement agencies earlier this decade when they were confronted with an 
increasing number of people who went into tantrums after taking the 
hallucinogenic drug PCP. 
</P>
<P>
The real-world problems with the nets became apparent only after they were 
placed in sergeants' cars at the 21 sheriff's stations. Recalled Block: "You 
have to have an individual who is clearly unarmed" -- something not easily 
determined -- "and who is acting deranged in an open area, where the deputies 
can get around him and throw it on him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has to Stay Put 
</P>
<P>
And the suspect has to stay put until a sergeant's car arrives with the 
contraption. 
</P>
<P>
The result? "It's probably several years since they were used." 
</P>
<P>
"Some things come along that I consider toys," the sheriff concluded, although 
not necessarily ready to retire the nets to fishing holes. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Block's department was one of the first to use $60,000 infrared 
scopes on helicopters to help find bodies on the ground, and the sheriff last 
month hosted a high-tech seminar that included demonstration of an 
Electrostatic Dust Print Lifter, which enables investigators to see otherwise 
invisible shoe prints by placing a static electrical charge on dust. 
</P>
<P>
But the big agencies inevitably are cautious, knowing that if they quickly 
embrace a new generation of bulletproof vest they risk being stuck with several 
thousand obsolete garments if an even lighter and stronger model comes along. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe government should be on the cutting edge of technology," said 
Cmdr. Bill Kirtley of the sheriff's Technical Services Division. "There's too 
much that can go wrong. . . . We want to be near the cutting edge, but don't 
want to be out there proving products for companies." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials have learned through painful experiences how new technology 
can create unique dangers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, an unauthorized "release message" on an internal computer enabled 
suspected Colombian drug dealer William Londono to slip out of the Central 
Jail. That same year, a veteran deputy was accused of tampering with a computer 
to erase traffic citations issued to his friends. Another deputy was accused -- 
but eventually acquitted -- of entering the license plate of her unpopular 
boss' car into the state's computerized list of stolen vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
In the LAPD, as with the Sheriff's Department, a new product must pass muster 
with an obstacle course of review panels and city agencies. Cmdr. Kramer was 
lucky, therefore, when he set out to upgrade the gang files in early 1985 -- he 
already had a small PC left over from the Olympics, a gift to the department. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some skepticism and pessimism whether it was viable to automate gang 
statistics . . . people not willing to accept change," Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
But Detective Delong was quickly "on line," and within a year several thousand 
gang members were in the computer by name, gang, physical description and 
aliases. Previously, members of the anti-gang CRASH squads had to sift through 
index cards in four locations to see if a certain tattoo, vehicle or nickname 
might lead them to a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the department obtained a state grant providing about $250,000 over 
four years for its Gang Reporting Evaluation and Tracking system -- dubbed 
GREAT -- to upgrade the computer, give terminals to all CRASH units and 
eventually link up with Sheriff's Department and county probation gang files. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Need You' 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Delong was giving a talk to the Southern California Police Assn. 
when he was approached by John Doyle, a sales vice president for Edicon, a 
subsidiary of Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at me and said, 'I need you,' " Delong recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Edicon had developed a computer to store photographs, which it was selling 
mostly as a security system. But the company also was approaching police, 
hoping they would decide the Photoimage Management System could save time 
searching through mug shots, now often strewn in file drawers. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Delong served as "a champion" for the product in a series of 
meetings in the LAPD, Doyle said. Typical of the deals by which new technology 
is introduced into police work, however, the result was not an actual sale of 
the $250,000 system. Edicon would rent it to the city, and meanwhile develop a 
computer program to serve Delong's needs. 
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee the LAPD will buy the system after testing it, but Doyle 
figures Edicon's investment will not be wasted. 
</P>
<P>
"What we expect to do is capitalize on their time and expertise to sell that 
software package or something similar to others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Often the first sales are to small and mid-sized departments, where there's no 
large bureaucracy. Delong noted with envy how easily one small Texas city was 
able to get a new computer program: "They used their narcotics forfeiture 
money. The chief told the lieutenant, 'Write a check.' " 
</P>
<P>
But money is a common barrier to acquiring new technology. According to a 
federal study, salaries and other daily operating expenses consumed more than 
98% of the budgets of large police departments in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD's current budget provides $10.1 million for vehicles, including 
helicopters, and only $847,000 for technical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We want everything for free," acknowledged Jan R. Duke, who is on the staff of 
the state's law enforcement Command College. 
</P>
<P>
Vizzolini, the Santa Barbara undersheriff, is an expert in the freebie game. He 
went into action in 1986 after state legislation implementing the Cal-ID 
network did not include his department among those getting significant access 
to technology that was revolutionizing fingerprint analysis.

Cal-ID is a computer system that can store the prints of millions of past 
offenders, then scan them for links to a print fragment found at a crime scene. 
The system gained instant renown when it matched in three minutes a print found 
near a Night Stalker assault with a then-unknown suspect, Richard Ramirez. He 
is now on trial. 
</P>
<P>
Vizzolini sought out Fingermatrix, a White Plains, N.Y., company that was 
starting to market potentially even more advanced fingerprint equipment -- 
"live scanning" computers that take and store prints electronically. They 
promise to save time and storage space while eliminating smudging and inking 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the department got on "extended loan" a fingerprint computer that was 
the product of more than $1 million in research. 
</P>
<P>
David G. Hall, who directs the marketing for Fingermatrix, said the company got 
in return "a good showcase" in California, where the Department of Justice is 
planning to buy about 300 scanners. Several companies will bid for what will be 
the first major sale of the devices -- at up to $80,000 each -- in the country. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Fingermatrix used Santa Barbara to introduce another product, one to 
transmit fingerprints to and from patrol cars. As with other devices that 
suggest James Bond approaches to crime fighting, it drew a good turnout of 
media and law enforcement dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Tracy would be proud of us," Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said after 
the unveiling of the apparatus, which is centered on a miniature index-finger 
scanner. 
</P>
<P>
As a company statement described it, a motorist stopped by police for a routine 
traffic violation might be asked to stick his finger in the scanner. The print 
then would be matched against those of "wanted" people kept by the FBI, which 
is considering a pilot project to enable the remote units to tap into its 
National Crime Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
Under the scenario, the print shows that the motorist -- who displayed a 
seemingly legitimate license -- has "a record on file under a different name 
and is wanted in three states for brutal crimes." 
</P>
<P>
The cost: $2,500 for each car equipped. 
</P>
<P>
Although many officials may put the device on their "wish lists" when it is 
perfected, they expect that civil liberties objections would make it difficult 
to use as routinely as the company suggests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Will Not Work That Way' 
</P>
<P>
"You're not just going to drive around and put everyone's finger in there," Los 
Angeles Sheriff's Cmdr. Kirtley said. "In actual operations it will not work 
that way, I can assure you." 
</P>
<P>
A police chief considering the $2,500 fingerprint apparatus may find himself 
weighing it against other types of computers that go in patrol cars. Does he 
want to use LoJack to quickly locate stolen cars? How about lap-tops, with 
which the officer could write a crime report even while interviewing a robbery 
victim? Or simpler mobile-digital terminals, the type pioneered by the LAPD, so 
patrol officers can communicate with headquarters without having to use public 
radio frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I always ask," said Duke of the Command College, "is when are they 
going to come up with cars big enough for us to put all that stuff in?" 
</P>
<P>
LoJack Corp., of Braintree, Mass., experienced one of the hazards of 
introducing a new crime-fighting tool -- the political factor. 
</P>
<P>
LoJack had followed the freebie route to showcase its stolen car tracking 
computer, developing it in a pilot program with Massachusetts State Police. 
When the system went operational in 1986, the company began making some money 
by selling motorists $600 transmitters, which must be planted in cars for 
police to track them. 
</P>
<P>
LoJack got a big break when the "Today Show" did a feature on the Massachusetts 
project in 1987. The LAPD called, leading to a 1 1/2-year test by its 
evaluations-and-audits unit, in which participating officers found more than 
100 cars hidden around the area. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), the former Los Angeles police chief, 
introduced legislation calling for the state to spend $1 million on tracking 
equipment for 200 patrol cars. The bill sailed through the state Senate, but 
stalled in the Assembly amid lobbying by California auto security firms. Their 
leader complained that the state was giving "a virtual monopoly on the auto 
recovery system to an out-of-state corporation." 
</P>
<P>
LoJack abandoned the $1-million sale. Instead, it simply gave the system to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't mean that will be a continuing practice," a frustrated LoJack 
President C. Michael Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
Zev Fogel and Alan Viterbi are partners in a year-old firm that is marketing 
two devices -- the parking ticket computer and photo radar. Viterbi, a former 
West Hollywood mayor, gave up a promising political career to devote all his 
time to the business, U.S. Public Technologies, which has offices in Los 
Angeles, San Diego and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the two men found themselves in Manhattan Beach City Hall, hoping to 
sell eight Japanese-made parking ticket computers. 
</P>
<P>
Such devices, which cost about $3,000 each, have been adopted by dozens of 
communities throughout the country. San Diego uses them, Long Beach recently 
bought 46 and Los Angeles -- where 50,000 citations are dismissed each year 
because of illegible handwriting -- is preparing to test them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Will Save You Time' 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan Beach, where there are three bidders for the contract, members of 
the city's Community Services Department tentatively passed around one of the 
small computers, not unlike young fathers trying to figure out how to cradle a 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be afraid of it," Fogel said. "It will save you time, it 
will save you aggravation." 
</P>
<P>
The device automatically signals if a car should be towed because of unpaid 
citations. City officials also can use it to track the work habits of the meter 
checkers, although this is hardly a feature the salesmen emphasize when showing 
it to the workers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, he and Viterbi were in Santa Cruz, hoping that it would become 
the fourth city in the country to adopt photo radar. With the help of Robert 
Umbdenstock, whose business imports the $40,000 device from Switzerland, they 
set up a demonstration; soon it was snapping pictures of cars going over the 
25-m.p.h. speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, guys, be the first on your block to have one," Umbdenstock muttered. 
</P>
<P>
In communities using photo radar, some motorists invariably complain that the 
photographs invade their privacy (they can show a man riding with a woman other 
than his wife), and others just don't like a contraption that changes the 
ground rules by which police chase speeders. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the marketing process, therefore, is to find officials, such as 
Pasadena's Cmdr. Bennett, willing "to take the heat, the controversy associated 
with this." Even then, because photo radar has not yet survived broad legal 
challenges, U.S. Public Technologies and two competing firms know that it would 
be futile to sell the apparatus to police. So they loan it out and process the 
tickets themselves for a commission, usually $20 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
While some new devices originate with companies seeking a profit, others are 
born in the field, the inspiration of officers facing a problem. 
</P>
<P>
A member of a Los Angeles SWAT team, worried about searching attics for 
suspects, developed a special long periscope. Morgan Hill's Gagne similarly 
came up with his "photo-imaging" system through his own tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
Gagne had already helped set up a central computer for his department when he 
decided that it would be nice to have in-car units as well. He approached the 
state Office of Criminal Justice Planning, which gives out "state-of-the-art" 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'We will not fund you for those. It is not state of the art,' " he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"So I gave it a little thought and said, 'How about if I transmit mug shots?' " 
</P>
<P>
He got $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
The kicker was that there really was not much need for such a process in Morgan 
Hill, a quiet bedroom and ranch community. While a big-city patrol officer 
might require a photo to help determine the identity of a suspect who refused 
to give his name, "a majority of the officers here, when they see a crook on 
the street, they recognize him," Gagne noted. 
</P>
<P>
But he got the computers he wanted. In headquarters, he connected a video 
camera with a mainframe, then found a special modem that could send the image 
out as dots over radio frequencies. Finally, he placed lap-top units on the 
dash boards of patrol cars to re-create the image. 
</P>
<P>
Although the process is not ready for everyday use -- it takes too long, 15 
minutes -- Gagne has some ideas on how to improve it. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by his work, the state Department of Justice this month began studying 
the feasibility of a statewide computer-video network, Cal-Photo, to enable 
many law enforcement agencies to almost instantly retrieve photographs of 
people with arrest records, missing persons, suspected terrorists or others. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gagne: "There are officers who have been in the business a long time who 
are a little hesitant, who will never buy into computers. On the other hand, 
there's a new generation coming into the business who don't know what it's like 
to operate without them. . . . Using the computer to them is as common as 
putting on a badge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CRIME-FIGHTING GOES HIGH-TECH 
</P>
<P>
 These are among the projects pending to develop high-tech crime-fighting 
tools: 
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT 
</P>
<P>
Voiceprints 
</P>
<P>
Helped by $220,000 from the National Institute of Justice and $60,000 from the 
Secret Service, a sheriff's team has been working for more than three years on 
a computerized system of analyzing voices. 
</P>
<P>
Although voiceprints have been accepted as evidence in more than two dozen 
states, they were rejected by the California Supreme Court in 1976 "until the 
time when there is demonstrated solid scientific support." A two-man sheriff's 
team has taken up the challenge of improving traditional voiceprint analysis, 
in which voice patterns are plotted on paper graphs, then interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
<P>
Lap-top computers 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD in May obtained a $246,000 grant from the National Institute of 
Justice to conduct a two-year study on the use of lap-top computers to write 
police reports. 
</P>
<P>
St. Petersburg, Fla., "started a revolution in police reporting" by developing 
an automated system, notes the application. But it is another matter to develop 
a system that can replace the block lettering with which LAPD officers write 3 
million reports a year. 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD proposes to funnel the reports into a central data base that can 
calculate crime statistics and detect crime patterns. The department will 
develop a training program for participating officers, including "access to 
computer games to increase familiarity." 
</P>
<P>
Under the system now, the grant application says, "It is conservatively 
estimated that 15 to 20% of an officer's time is spent taking reports," which 
"are often difficult to read, incomplete, or not presented in a logical or 
sequential manner." 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF/CORONER'S DEPARTMENT 
</P>
<P>
DNA laboratory 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Sheriff's Advisory Council threw a party in April to raise 
$200,000 in private funds for what Sheriff Brad Gates called "a Star Wars 
product." Gates' chief criminologist, Margaret Kuo, wanted to start a DNA 
testing lab. 
</P>
<P>
Ask law enforcement officials to name the most significant high-tech 
development and "DNA fingerprinting" likely will be first on the list. By 
matching patterns in the genetic material, it enables authorities to tie a 
suspect to a rape or other crime scene through tiny samples of body tissue or 
fluid. In January, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp gave California prosecutors 
the go-ahead to bring such evidence to court. 
</P>
<P>
PASADENA 
</P>
<P>
Red light surveillance camera 
</P>
<P>
Although Pasadena police have gained a reputation for trying new technology, 
that doesn't mean they endorse everything they try. A recent test of a 
computerized surveillance camera to catch people running red lights -- a system 
that also has been tested in New York -- produced disappointing results, Lt. 
Robert Huff said. Some cars triggered the device when they merely nosed into an 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
But Pasadena officials were very pleased with their first 12 months with 
Swiss-made photo-radar equipment. Although the device has the ability to 
photograph more than 200 speeders an hour, it was used in moderation; it was 
activated 800 hours and generated 8,877 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas 9.2% of all cars were speeding past the device when it first was used, 
Huff noted, only 4.5% did so by the end of the year.

BUSH URGES MOON BASE, TRIP TO MARS; 
</P>
<P>
ALSO BACKS COSTLY SPACE STATION PLAN; OFFERS FEW DETAILS

<P>
President Bush, charting a course for an American return to space exploration, 
Thursday challenged the nation to commit itself to a permanent manned presence 
in space and, in the next century, to send a manned spaceship to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the 20th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing, Bush said the 
Apollo astronauts "left more than flags and footprints on the moon. They also 
left some unfinished business." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the United States must begin a journey "back to the moon, back to the 
future, and this time, back to stay." 
</P>
<P>
But, although Bush threw his support solidly behind a pending $30-billion 
program to launch a manned space station called Freedom, the President stopped 
short of advocating specific timetables or budgets for more distant space 
exploration targets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quayle to Work Out Details 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bush directed Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National 
Space Council, to work out the details. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's address, delivered on the steps of the Smithsonian Institution's Air and 
Space Museum, apparently helped head off a serious political defeat for the 
space program in Congress. Acting just hours later, the House rejected an 
attempt to strike $714 million from the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration's budget for the space station program. 
</P>
<P>
The scuttled amendment, proposed during House debate on a 1990 appropriation 
bill, would have shifted the money to medical programs for veterans, pollution 
control efforts and housing assistance. The House Appropriations Committee 
already had cut $400 million from the $2 billion sought by the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints About Expense 
</P>
<P>
But Bush's speech drew a cautious response from lawmakers, who complained that 
the space station alone has proven too expensive for a Congress already under 
intense fiscal pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the federal budget deficit and earthly demands, I don't see how we can 
afford expensive manned programs in space in the near future," said Rep. Bill 
Green (R-N.Y.), ranking Republican on the House subcommittee that funds NASA. 
</P>
<P>
"People also dream of a home in the country or a trip around the world," Green 
said, "but like couples with big mortgages and kids in college, this country 
has bills to pay before taking costly adventures." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the President, Michael Collins, the astronaut who commanded the 
Apollo spaceship 20 years ago while his fellow astronauts walked on the moon, 
defended the space program in the face of competing national priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot launch our planetary probes from a springboard of poverty, 
discrimination or unrest," Collins said. "But neither can we wait until each 
and every terrestrial problem has been solved. Such logic 200 years ago would 
have prevented expansion westward of the Appalachian Mountains, for assuredly 
the Eastern Seaboard was beset by problems of great urgency then, as it is 
today." 
</P>
<P>
NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly said his agency has devised no firm cost 
estimates for the more ambitious goals advocated by the President. But 
independent experts have said that an aggressive program designed to establish 
a permanent moon presence and to launch a manned Mars probe could cost $30 
billion to $35 billion annually, almost doubling current expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the budgets will turn out to be, but I can assure you that 
they are very affordable, I believe, in the total context and over a long 
period of time," Truly said. 
</P>
<P>
Truly said that earlier independent space commissions have called for such 
undertakings as the manned exploration of Mars and the establishment of a 
permanent research station on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"Until this morning, we really have not had a President who laid out in broad 
terms his view and his series of goals so that the Space Council and NASA can 
flesh them out," Truly said. 
</P>
<P>
In advocating a return to the moon and an eventual mission to Mars, Bush 
appears to have seized the initiative from the Soviet Union. For years, those 
programs have been long-term goals of Soviet scientists and space officials, 
said Nicholas L. Johnson, an advisory scientist with Teledyne-Brown Engineering 
and an expert on the Soviet space program. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the nation's first space priority is the space station, which would 
be lofted into orbit in phases, beginning in 1995. He called the future 
spacecraft "a new bridge between the worlds and an investment in the growth, 
prosperity and technical superiority of our nation." 
</P>
<P>
The President and NASA officials also emphasized the space station's role in 
researching earthly problems, such as global warming, also known as the 
greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The space station will also serve as a steppingstone to the most important 
planet in the solar system, Planet Earth," Bush said.

UC BERKELEY CHANCELLOR ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
UC Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman, who has led that prestigious and 
argumentative campus since 1980, announced Thursday that he will resign next 
year and return to teaching law and city planning. 
</P>
<P>
Heyman, 59, said he is resigning "to regain the sense of perspective you have 
as a faculty member." Including his six previous years as vice chancellor, 
Heyman will have been a top administrator for 16 years and that, he said, "is a 
long time at a place like Berkeley." 
</P>
<P>
His reign as chancellor has been quieter than those of predecessors in the 
1960s when the campus was a center of student protest. Nevertheless, Heyman 
faced controversies over alleged bias against the admission of Asian-American 
students and over university growth in a city that sometimes has treated UC 
officials like hostile invaders. 
</P>
<P>
Heyman's resignation, effective next June 30, leaves an opening at what many in 
higher education consider to be one of the world's finest research 
universities, public or private. Nobel Prizes and other symbols of academic 
power are sprinkled throughout the Berkeley faculty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search Committee 
</P>
<P>
UC President David P. Gardner said he will soon appoint a committee to search 
for Heyman's successor. 
</P>
<P>
"The state of California, the University of California and the Berkeley campus 
have been extraordinarily well served" by Heyman, Gardner told a press 
conference at a UC Regents meeting here Thursday. He stressed that he was 
reluctantly accepting the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing one of the trademark bow ties that add to his genial, professorial air, 
Heyman said one of his biggest accomplishments was enrolling more minority 
students. Last fall, non-Anglos made up 51% of UC Berkeley undergraduates, 
compared to 34% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
However, Heyman was embroiled for years in charges that the school was trying 
to limit the number of Asian-American students. That led to several 
investigations by faculty and the state government and to some changes in 
admission policy. Heyman eventually apologized to the Asian community for what 
he said was earlier insensitivity to their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who is chairman of the Assembly 
subcommittee on higher education, issued a statement Thursday in praise of 
Heyman. "He will be most remembered for his recent leadership and sensitivity 
on the Asian admission issue," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Heyman said his other accomplishments include 
construction of new science buildings and more student housing, as well as a 
sharp increase in annual private donations to the school, from $31 million in 
1980 to more than $100 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he conceded that he has tired of the sometimes confrontational politics on 
campus and such lingering disputes as whether UC should build dormitories on 
People's Park and on campus hilltops. The People's Park plan, strongly opposed 
by the city, led to a street riot 20 years ago and another one a few months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The rhetoric is a little more abrasive at a place like Berkeley," Heyman said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, who is the dean of UC campus heads with 20 years 
on the job, said he was expecting Heyman's resignation. "I think it's been 
clear for some time that Mike is getting to the point that he wants to do 
something else with his life," said Young, who credited Heyman with helping to 
heal the wounds of campus protests during the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Clodius, president of the National Assn. of State Universities and Land 
Grant Colleges, also said he was not surprised by Heyman's announcement. "Some 
of the things you have to put up with (as chancellor) get old after a while," 
he said in a telephone interview from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Clodius called Heyman "one of the truly great, unapologetic liberal thinkers I 
know of in higher education." 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Rodriguez, student representative on the Board of Regents, said 
Heyman was very accessible to students and fair in dealing with protests. The 
chancellor's main weakness, according to the UC Berkeley senior, was in not 
pushing harder to increase the number of minority professors. 
</P>
<P>
Heyman said he also is unhappy with the ethnic composition of the faculty but 
stressed that more minority scholars appear to be in the pipeline toward 
teaching. Non-whites make up 10.2% of the faculty now, compared to 8.5% when he 
became chancellor, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Heyman said he will take a year's sabbatical and then return to teaching and 
research at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall law school and the department of city and 
regional planning. He said he wants to concentrate on environmental and 
transportation issues in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
He will take a still unspecified pay cut from his now annual salary of 
$142,900. 
</P>
<P>
An alumnus of Dartmouth College and Yale University Law School, Heyman joined 
the UC Berkeley law faculty in 1959 after serving as chief clerk to then-U.S. 
Chief Justice Earl Warren. He became vice chancellor in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Three years into his chancellorship, Heyman was widely considered a finalist 
for the presidency of the nine-campus UC system. That job went to Gardner and 
the two men later had some conflicts, although on Thursday they described each 
other as good friends. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about qualifications for his successor, Heyman listed top scholarship, 
egalitarian ideals and "good luck."

QUAYLES ARE SMITTEN, MAY LOOK FOR PLACE IN CALIFORNIA

<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle is considering buying a home in Southern California, 
according to an adviser, a move that could have political ramifications should 
he decide to seek the presidency in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle spent four days in the state earlier this week, giving speeches and 
touring aerospace facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The Quayles own no home outside Washington and in their first extended visit 
to California this week, they thoroughly enjoyed the state -- in fact, they 
fell in love with it," Quayle press secretary David Beckwith said Thursday in a 
telephone interview from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"The vice president and Mrs. Quayle think California would be a delightful 
place to have a second home or retreat," Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no house hunting so far, he said, but there may be in late 
August when Quayle returns to tour the Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle has long been a part of the Republican Party's conservative wing, so 
Orange County or northern San Diego County would seem likely prospects for a 
Quayle home. 
</P>
<P>
But Beckwith said only that the Quayles are interested in Southern California, 
and California Republican political strategist Kenneth L. Khachigian cautioned 
against reading too much into a Quayle move to California. 
</P>
<P>
"He's simply talking about a vacation home," Khachigian said. "The vice 
president is very worried about the impact of his job on his family and one way 
to keep everybody together is to find a place where they can do things 
together. California is perfect because the Quayles are a very active, 
recreation-oriented family. I'm not even sure he's talking about buying; he may 
just want to rent a place." 
</P>
<P>
Beckwith said the Quayles own no real estate in their home state of Indiana. 
They live in the official vice president's residence in Washington and next 
month will rent out their home in suburban McLean, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republican political sources have speculated that if Quayle wants to 
succeed President Bush in eight years, he would do well to find a better home 
base than Indiana, which has only 12 electoral votes. 
</P>
<P>
California, which like Indiana usually votes Republican in presidential races, 
has 47 electoral votes and could have as many as 53 after the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
On another matter involving the vice president's California trip, Quayle's 
staff was busy Thursday trying to reassure anti-abortion leaders that comments 
in Los Angeles by the vice president did not mean he has softened his staunch 
opposition to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with reporters Monday, Quayle said the anti-abortion forces should 
concentrate on getting restrictions on abortion, not on an outright ban, now 
that the Supreme Court has given states more power in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
But in a meeting with Times editors and reporters, Quayle said in response to a 
question: "No, I haven't shifted my position. I still think the Roe decision 
(legalizing abortion in 1973) was wrong."

PANEL TO STUDY USE OF UNPROVED DRUGS FOR AIDS;

U.S. OFFICIALS SEEK TO GET PROMISING TREATMENTS TO PATIENTS MORE QUICKLY

Federal health officials have established a special task force to address 
serious concerns among them over how proposed so-called "parallel track" human 
studies of experimental AIDS drugs will operate, Assistant Secretary for Health 
James O. Mason announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mason said that virtually everyone in the federal health community agrees with 
the broad concept that promising AIDS drugs should be made much more accessible 
while they are still being studied but that critical problems must be resolved 
before such a program can begin. 
</P>
<P>
"Implementation of this initiative will occur as we resolve the difficult 
questions such a program raises," he said in testimony before the House Energy 
and Commerce subcommittee on health. "We are confident, however, that we can 
resolve these issues and thus develop and implement this initiative rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Parallel Track' Trials 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of AIDS activities for the National 
Institutes of Health, proposed that a more flexible program be created that 
would enable AIDS patients who are not qualified for traditional highly 
structured clinical trials to get experimental drugs through what he dubbed 
"parallel track" trials. The drugs would be made available after their safety 
had been established but before their efficacy in treating the disease was 
proved. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was praised by AIDS activists, who long have argued that, because the 
disease is fatal, AIDS patients should have the choice of whether or not to 
take unproved drugs. But it also drew pleas for caution from AIDS researchers 
who are worried that participation in traditional trials would suffer and that 
scientific integrity would be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
Mason said that, among other things, the federal government must first devise 
ways of identifying and evaluating unexpected deaths or serious illnesses 
associated with the experimental use of these drugs and that it must also 
develop a process for determining who will be eligible to receive them. 
</P>
<P>
The first potential problem was dramatically illustrated several weeks ago when 
an AIDS patient participating in an unauthorized trial of a Chinese drug known 
as Compound Q died, possibly from its side effects, another committed suicide 
and several others developed serious complications. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Mason said, issues regarding legal liability and management of the 
parallel track trials would have to be settled. 
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials have met at least twice within the last two weeks to 
discuss these issues and have failed to resolve them, according to sources 
within the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists, who are largely responsible for persuading government 
regulators to institute these new procedures, complained Thursday that they are 
beginning to lose patience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied With Results 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it is time for the voice of patients to be given first priority," said 
Martin Delaney, co-director of Project Inform in San Francisco. "After eight 
years of patience and cooperation, we are increasingly dissatisfied with the 
results." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 
agreed. "Forming a committee is the usual bureaucratic response to avoid 
difficult decision-making," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mason said that he has asked the panel, which will be under the auspices of the 
Food and Drug Administration -- which regulates the approval of new drugs -- to 
report back to him no later than Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the parallel track studies would be run as an "open protocol," 
meaning that there will not be a simultaneous control group to use for 
comparison. "It does not signify that the investigational agent is made widely 
available without restriction," he said. Only patients who are not eligible for 
structured trials will be accepted for parallel track studies.

SOVIET COAL STRIKE CLOSES MINES IN 4 NEW AREAS

<P>
Some striking Soviet coal miners returned to their jobs Thursday after winning 
major concessions from the government, but new shutdowns were reported in four 
previously unaffected areas as some of the most serious labor unrest here since 
the 1920s placed increasing pressure on the country's ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the miners in Siberia's Kuznets Basin, where the trouble started 11 
days ago, were expected to be back at work today after a top Communist Party 
official signed a 35-point agreement granting higher pay, an immediate increase 
in supplies of food and consumer goods, and improvements in living and working 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the strike committee, Boris Krivets, said in a telephone interview 
from Kemerovo that the pact includes specific deadlines for reaching 
longer-term goals and an understanding that if the government fails to adhere 
to the timetable, the miners will go off the job again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
35 More Closures 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Soviet news media reported that new strikes had shut down at 
least 35 more mines Wednesday and Thursday as the unrest spread to additional 
regions of the country. The new strikers' demands reportedly were similar to 
those of their colleagues in Siberia and the Donets Basin of the Ukraine, where 
shutdowns started last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The newly closed mines included 14 in the important Karaganda coal basin of 
northern Kazakhstan; nine of 13 in Vorkuta, which is part of the Pechora coal 
basin in the far north; all 11 in Pavlograd, near Dnepropetrovsk in the 
Ukraine, and the largest in the Don River region at Rostov-on-Don. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the strike committee at Makeyevka in the Donets Basin said by 
telephone that an agreement had been reached with a government commission to 
end the strikes there as of Thursday evening. But the situation remained 
unclear. The evening television news reported 100 pits still closed well past 
the deadline. The night before, 70 of the Donets Basin's 120 mines had been 
reported on strike. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear is that the strikes are having an increasingly acute impact on 
the general economy. 
</P>
<P>
"They've lost an awful lot of coal," said one Western analyst who has been 
following the situation, "and in a taut economy, even a day's loss of 
production is a lot because there is so little slack in the system. Any time 
deliveries get disrupted, it is felt almost immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in an unscheduled address to 
Parliament on Wednesday that more than 1 million tons of production had been 
lost already. 
</P>
<P>
"This loss cannot be recouped," he said, adding that the spread of the unrest 
could have "very far-reaching economic, social and political consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Others estimate that the strikes have cost up to 6 million tons of production 
-- three full days' output at the average rate. Soviet television said the 
strikes in the Donets Basin alone were costing about 5 million rubles a day, $8 
million at the official exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
State television reported Wednesday from the Donets city of Yenakiyevo that 
steel and chemical plants were "on the verge of stoppage" for lack of coal. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Gorbachev's warnings that the spreading labor unrest could seriously 
undermine his reform program, some analysts questioned whether it will be 
possible to hold the line in view of the news media's widespread and generally 
sympathetic coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next week," the Western analyst said, "but I 
find it very difficult to believe that it's not going to happen in other 
industries." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya reported Thursday that strikes or work 
slowdowns had already occurred in Kuznets Basin industries not directly related 
to coal production. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how the authorities could satisfy the demands of all this 
country's unhappy workers in view of the growing budget deficit, runaway 
inflation and chronic shortages of food, housing and consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television quoted miners at Rostov-on-Don as saying that poor living 
conditions in the region were the main reason for their strike. People there 
are limited to seven ounces of butter and seven ounces of soap a month. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-point Siberian agreement pledges significantly increased supplies of 
meat, butter, sugar, tea, leather shoes, furniture and cars in the Kuznets 
mining region, according to news reports and strike committee officials. 
</P>
<P>
Independent observers were skeptical that the government could fulfill such a 
pledge without further depriving some other part of the country. However, 
Gorbachev told a meeting of regional party officials last week that the 
government has set aside an additional 10 billion rubles (about $16 billion) to 
import consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for improved shift and regional pay premiums, more 
economic autonomy for the mines and improved pensions. Authorities said they 
will not punish strike leaders and that miners will receive full wages for the 
time they have been off the job.

SHAMIR-SHARON FEUD FLARES IN ANGRY EXCHANGE

A feud between Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and hard-liner Ariel Sharon burst 
into the open Thursday, and newspapers said Shamir might fire the former 
defense minister from the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon, now trade minister, has been challenging Shamir's leadership of the 
right-wing Likud Party. He renewed attacks Thursday on the prime minister's 
peace plan for the occupied territories, demanding that the Cabinet focus on 
crushing the 19-month-old Palestinian rebellion rather than debating the 
language of peace proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The former general said on Army Radio: "No personal attacks or threats to fire 
me will keep me from demanding an end to the murder of Jews in the land of 
Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Yossi Ahimeir, spokesman for Shamir, would not comment on reports in two major 
newspapers, the liberal Haaretz and the independent Yediot Aharonot, that 
Shamir is considering dismissing Sharon. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's anger erupted in a closed meeting Wednesday of Likud ministers, where 
Sharon criticized the prime minister for not disclosing details of his talks 
with Palestinians about election arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers quoted this exchange: 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot tell you anything; you leak everything you get your hands on," Shamir 
responded. He accused Sharon of "sowing bad blood and hatred among us." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon said: "I can only laugh at your words. I have contempt for what you 
say." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir replied: "He who laughs last laughs best, and I don't want to speak to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Several newspapers interpreted Shamir's words as a threat to fire Sharon. 
Yediot Aharonot said the prime minister's allies in Likud are urging him to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
Ahimeir suggested, however, that Shamir wants to avoid a split. 
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is concerned about the unity of the Likud," the spokesman 
said. "He has a high tolerance threshold and tries to see things in their 
broadest sense."

PRIVATE ELECTRONIC BUGGING GROWS, KOREANS SAY 
</P>

Illicit eavesdropping by the government on private conversations, once a fact 
of daily life in South Korea, is decreasing, but such activity by private 
citizens is on the rise, the International Rights League of Korea is charging. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Jong Mok, a member of the league's standing committee, said recently that 
complaints filed with the league about private bugging have been increasing as 
the lifting of authoritarian controls has helped turn South Korea into a more 
assertive -- and argumentative -- society. 
</P>
<P>
Business enemies are bugging each other, he said, and management is tapping 
phones and eavesdropping on conversations in labor union offices. At the same 
time, he said, politicians are listening in on their rivals, and foreign 
investors, including American and Japanese businessmen, have been accused of 
bugging their employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies bug individual workers who have complaints against management to 
find an excuse to fire them," said Kang Seung Hee, another member of the 
standing committee. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers in the Seun electronics market in downtown Seoul report that women are 
buying the devices to check on their husbands. And some men, the dealers said, 
appear to be checking on their wives. 
</P>
<P>
Although sales of the devices are illegal, South Korea has no law against their 
use, except by employees of the government-run telephone company, Lee said. 
Worse yet, he added, the courts regularly accept as evidence information 
provided by listening devices. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the increasing complaints, Lee said, the Human Rights League has 
undertaken a campaign to outlaw bugging completely, along with the secret 
recording of telephone conversations. A bill has been submitted to the National 
Assembly but, contrary to the league's wishes, it would allow the courts to 
authorize the police to eavesdrop on conversations if national security issues 
are involved. 
</P>
<P>
Kang said that police suspicions of national security violations have often 
included virtually any anti-government activity, and he charged that the 
independence of the courts is not assured. 
</P>
<P>
"It's doubtful that the courts in Korea would turn down any request," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the league received 32 bugging complaints last year and has received 
10 so far this year, "but we believe those complaints represent no more than 
10% of the actual cases." 
</P>
<P>
Dealers in the Seun market say they sell all the bugging devices they can 
obtain. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the bugging devices are smuggled in from Japan or Taiwan, and most of 
the customers, a dealer said, want Japanese models, which sell for around $225. 
Korean-made devices cost as little as $42, he said, but "since buyers are 
always in desperate need, we can charge four to five times the cost."

WALLACH TESTIFIES HE DID NOT KNOW THAT FILING FALSE AFFIDAVIT IS FEDERAL CRIME 
</P>

<P>
San Francisco lawyer E. Robert Wallach, apparently rattled by the disclosure 
that he had understated his income in a sworn statement submitted to a federal 
court in 1984, testified at his racketeering trial Thursday that he did not 
know filing a false affidavit is a federal crime. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Baruch Weiss, in his first few minutes of cross-examination after 
Wallach had been questioned by his own lawyer, handed the defendant, who has 
practiced law for 25 years, a statement that the defendant had submitted to a 
Washington court in December, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The statement requested payment by the government of legal fees Wallach had 
earned representing then Atty. Gen.-designate Edwin Meese III, his longtime 
friend, during an ethics investigation of Meese by court-appointed counsel 
Jacob A. Stein. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Earned No Income' 
</P>
<P>
Wallach's affidavit in which he sought payment included a statement that 
between March and September, 1984 -- the length of Stein's inquiry -- "I earned 
no income from any other source, including the practice of law." 
</P>
<P>
Wallach testified that he thought the statement was correct because he had 
performed no legal work for anyone but Meese during that period. However, Weiss 
declared that financial records showed Wallach had earned more than $200,000 
from other sources during 1984, including at least $50,000 from Wedtech for 
allegedly lobbying Meese, who was White House counsel at the time. 
</P>
<P>
To support his case, Weiss produced three checks for legal fees to Wallach 
totaling more than $125,000, which Wallach had deposited during the six-month 
period cited in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you know," the prosecutor demanded, "that the filing of a sworn 
affidavit which is false constitutes a felony?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't believe so," Wallach replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it your testimony," Weiss pursued, "that you don't know after 25 years of 
legal practice that filing a false affidavit is a federal crime?" 
</P>
<P>
"That is my testimony," Wallach said softly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awarded $80,000 
</P>
<P>
Because Stein's six-month inquiry did not result in any criminal charges being 
filed against Meese, Meese was eligible to have his legal fees paid by the 
government under terms of the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. Wallach ultimately 
was awarded about $80,000 in fees. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier testimony Thursday, Wallach told jurors that he was kept in the dark 
about the corrupt activities of Wedtech Corp. leaders while serving as a 
consultant to the now-defunct New York defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by his lawyer, Gary P. Naftalis, Wallach said that two 
company officers who have testified against him never told him about their 
"systematic looting" of the fledgling firm or the fact that they kept a secret 
$1-million slush fund to bribe congressmen and other federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Investigation 
</P>
<P>
Wallach said that he received an urgent phone call in 1986 in which Mario 
Moreno, then Wedtech's executive vice president, told him that a federal 
investigation into the company had begun. Moreno later came to see him in San 
Francisco, Wallach said, adding that he arranged for Wedtech officers to be 
represented by a New York attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Naftalis asked whether Moreno or Anthony Guariglia, who was Wedtech's chief 
financial officer, "at that time disclosed to you that they had been 
systematically looting the company?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," Wallach replied, adding that neither did they tell him about the secret 
off-the-books fund used to make payoffs to government officials. Former Rep. 
Mario Biaggi (D-N.Y.) and a former high-ranking official of the Small Business 
Administration have been convicted of receiving bribes from this fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleaded Guilty 
</P>
<P>
Moreno and Guariglia are among former Wedtech officers who pleaded guilty two 
years ago to conspiracy and other crimes in the Wedtech influence-buying 
scandal. Both have testified that Wallach was part of the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach is on trial in Manhattan federal court with two other former Wedtech 
consultants, W. Franklyn Chinn, also of San Francisco, and R. Kent London of 
Honolulu. Upon conviction, they would face maximum prison terms of 20 years 
each and millions of dollars in fines.

COMPUTER NETWORK SEEN AS STILL VULNERABLE TO VIRUSES

A massive electronic network linking more than 60,000 computers remains 
vulnerable to potentially crippling attack by computer "viruses," the General 
Accounting Office reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the White House science adviser 
should oversee efforts to help protect the network, Internet, from sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
It said lax security procedures on Internet contributed to the severity of 
problems that resulted when a software virus "infected" the system last 
November, crippling thousands of computers. 
</P>
<P>
Internet, the main computer network used by the U.S. research community, 
comprises more than 500 national, regional and local networks nationwide and 
overseas. Two of the largest component networks are sponsored by the Pentagon's 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report was released at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. 
</P>
<P>
Jack L. Brock Jr., director of the GAO's government information and financial 
management division, said that since the virus attack last fall, security has 
been strengthened on many computers connected to Internet. However, "we still 
feel that the lack of central control (over security) . . . remains a problem," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Computer viruses are usually small strings of code that programmers can use to 
infiltrate a computer's software and replicate a procedure thousands of times, 
causing computer systems to "crash." In some cases the code can destroy 
computer data. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report noted that currently "there is no lead agency or organization 
responsible for Internet-wide management. Responsibility for computer security 
rests largely with the host sites that own and operate the computers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Interagency Group' 
</P>
<P>
To help ensure needed security improvements, the GAO recommended that the 
President's science adviser, through the White House Office of Science and 
Technology Policy, "coordinate the establishment of an interagency group . . . 
to serve as the Internet security focal point." 
</P>
<P>
It said this group should provide Internet-wide security policy, direction and 
coordination; support continuing efforts to enhance Internet security, and 
become an integral part of the structure that emerges to manage a high-speed 
National Research Network planned for the 1990s.

MAN GUILTY IN PLOT TO SELL U.S. SECRETS TO SOVIET BLOC

A former civilian worker for the Army was convicted Thursday of conspiring with 
a U.S. soldier to sell American military secrets to East German and Soviet 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
The guilty verdict against Huseyin Yildirim, 61, was returned by a U.S. 
District Court jury. Judge B. Avant Edenfield said he would sentence Yildirim, 
who could be given life in prison, within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Yildirim, a Turkish-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, was charged with conspiring 
with Warrant Officer James William Hall III to sell classified information to 
Soviet Bloc agents between 1983 and 1988, when Hall was stationed in Germany 
and New Jersey. Yildirim was working as a mechanic at an Army auto shop in 
Germany at the time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen Damaging to U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Defense experts said the espionage scheme damaged U.S. intelligence efforts in 
Europe. Hall worked as an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic 
and coded messages. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was held here because Hall was stationed at nearby Ft. Stewart at the 
time of his arrest last December. He pleaded guilty at a court-martial in March 
and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments Wednesday, defense lawyer Lamar Walter argued that Hall 
was solely to blame for the espionage. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence you heard is sufficient to convict him (Hall), but not my man," 
Walter said. "Mr. Hall is very definitely a guilty man. The man is not capable 
of being believed." 
</P>
<P>
Walter called no witnesses after Assistant U.S. Atty. Fred Kramer rested the 
government's case. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer contended the evidence showed overwhelmingly that Yildirim was Hall's 
contact, that he carried documents to the Soviets and East Germans and that he 
returned with money. 
</P>
<P>
Before resting his case, Kramer elicited testimony from FBI espionage expert 
Nicholas J. Walsh that a "Dear Friend" letter found among Yildirim's property 
in Berlin included a "shopping list . . . a list of things they would like . . 
. . You would probably be paid the most for it." 
</P>
<P>
Testimony said Yildirim's fingerprint was found on the unsigned letter. FBI 
agents testified that Yildirim's fingerprints also were on two $50 bills found 
in Hall's truck. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents seized the bills, a phony passport and military intelligence 
documents at Hall's home and from his truck in Richmond Hill, Ga., when he was 
arrested Dec. 20, evidence showed.

CONYERS RETRACTS SUPPORT OF LUCAS, CITES STANCE ON SUPREME COURT RIGHTS RULINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a dramatic development that threatens William Lucas' nomination as the 
government's chief civil rights enforcer, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) 
Thursday withdrew his endorsement a day after introducing Lucas to the Senate 
Judiciary Committee with warm praise. 
</P>
<P>
Conyers told a hushed session of the panel that he was taking the unusual 
action with "a slightly heavy heart" because of Lucas' hands-off position on 
recent Supreme Court rulings that civil rights leaders regard as disastrous 
setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I want someone who is deeply disturbed" by the decisions, Conyers said, 
contending that they had plunged the civil rights movement into a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Conyers' reversal could provide Lucas' foes with crucial momentum in their 
struggle against his nomination as assistant attorney general for civil rights. 
Conyers is an influential black leader in Congress and the Administration had 
turned to him to introduce Lucas, who also is black, after the nominee's two 
home state Michigan senators broke with tradition and declined to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In another blow to Lucas' prospects, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph 
R. Biden Jr.(D-Del.), who advised civil rights leaders last week that he was 
inclined to vote for Lucas, told the same officials Thursday at the panel 
hearing that he is now leaning against confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Biden cited Lucas' lack of an opinion when he asked him about the Supreme Court 
rulings, whether the country was moving in the right direction on civil rights 
and whether the Ronald Reagan Administration had been for or against civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setbacks, David Runkel, spokesman for Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, 
said: "I still expect Bill Lucas to be confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
Conyers' withdrawal of support -- he said he was not asking the committee to 
vote against recommending Lucas' confirmation -- came after he met Thursday 
morning with Lucas and John Mackey of the Justice Department's office of 
congressional affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials then discussed with Conyers' staff issuing a joint 
statement that "they share a commitment to civil rights," but Conyers, after 
reviewing Lucas' testimony, decided that did not go far enough, sources 
familiar with the meeting said. 
</P>
<P>
In introducing his longtime friend Wednesday to the Senate committee, Conyers 
had said he was "convinced Bill Lucas will go to greatness" in the high-level 
Justice Department post. "If he doesn't, I will be the first one calling for 
his head on a pike." 
</P>
<P>
But after reviewing a transcript of Lucas' testimony on "the most enormous 
question facing the civil rights community," which he did not remain in 
Wednesday's session to hear, Conyers said he "was frankly astounded." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, echoing comments by Thornburgh, President Bush and Vice President Dan 
Quayle, said he did not view the high court rulings as having substantial 
impact on civil rights law and promised to monitor them aggressively instead of 
proposing legislation to counteract the rulings. The rulings narrowed the use 
of affirmative action and plaintiffs' options in job discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
He contended that the Justice Department's civil rights division believes that 
the rulings have "a sound basis in law" and that they have not undermined civil 
rights, an assessment that Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said he found hard to 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he could live with these cases," Conyers told the hearing. "I can't 
live with these cases." 
</P>
<P>
In predicting that Lucas would win Senate confirmation, Runkel said: "This guy 
went up there and voiced the views of the Administration. It's unrealistic to 
think that he would do other than that. If the expectation of some people is 
that a liberal Democrat is going to be nominated" to the civil rights post, 
"they're wrong. It ain't going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, a former Wayne County, Mich., sheriff and county executive, has also 
drawn criticism from the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony Thursday, Henry Sanders, president of the Alabama New South 
Coalition, one of that state's major civil rights groups, said: "I submit to 
you that if Mr. Lucas was white that there would be no problem in rejecting 
him. But he's black, and it's civil rights and both of those have a different 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's terrible when you have to deal with a different standard." 
</P>
<P>
Although Conyers' reversal and Biden's comment mark significant setbacks for 
Lucas, his opponents were cautious in assessing the impact. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very close," said Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the 
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. "He came out of the hearings in much 
worse shape than he went into them." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Biden, Sens. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.), Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) and Simon have all 
seemed concerned by Lucas' testimony. The committee has 14 members, and Lucas 
went into the hearing backed by five Republicans and one of the panel's eight 
Democrats, Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona.

SURVIVOR RATE TIED TO CREW'S EXPERTISE;

HIGH PRAISE HEAPED ON PILOT FOR 'HEROISM'

United Airlines Capt. Alfred C. Haynes had planned to spend Thursday at home in 
Seattle, umpiring the district Little League championships. Instead, he spent 
the day resting in an Iowa hospital, being hailed as a hero for his piloting of 
the crippled DC-10 jumbo jet that crash-landed in Sioux City Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow pilots said that preliminary reports of the massive engine and hydraulic 
malfunctions that afflicted the aircraft in flight have left them wondering how 
Haynes was able to control the 15-year-old plane at all. 
</P>
<P>
But, they said, the former Marine Corps aviator -- one of United Airline's most 
senior pilots -- is among the best in his field. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always top-notch," said retired United Capt. Dick Weisner, who served 
as Haynes' supervisor for many years. "He's a very fine pilot," Weisner said. 
"I can't recommend anybody any higher." 
</P>
<P>
A surviving passenger put the matter more simply. "Our pilot was a hero," John 
Transue told reporters. "He really saved our butts." 
</P>
<P>
Friends and neighbors of Haynes in Seattle said that a hero label fits the 
pilot, who was named the state's Little League Volunteer of the Year days 
before he left on Flight 232. 
</P>
<P>
"Just knowing him and the way he is, I would have wanted him to be the man 
behind the controls," said Jim Chavez, who has worked closely with Haynes in 
Little League for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said Haynes planned to umpire the district league championships on 
Sunday, but it rained so he promised to be back on Thursday to call the 
rescheduled games. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the veteran pilot was in a Sioux City hospital after the ordeal that 
began Wednesday 1 1/2 hours after his plane, carrying 282 passengers, a 
three-person cockpit crew and eight flight attendants, left Denver en route to 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to air traffic controllers in Minneapolis, Haynes reported that the 
plane had lost power in one of its three engines, was losing altitude and 
becoming difficult to control. A minute later, he reported "complete hydraulic 
failure" -- total loss of the systems that allow the pilot to control the 
plane's rudder, ailerons, flaps and other vital equipment. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 41 minutes, Haynes, First Officer W. R. Records and Second Officer 
D. J. Dvorak, struggled to bring the giant plane safely to the ground from 
31,000 feet as flight attendants drilled passengers in the procedure for a 
crash landing. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, United officials were crediting the crew's work with the survival of 
more than half the passengers aboard the jetliner, which rolled over repeatedly 
and burst into flames after touching down just short of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
United Airlines Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said after visiting crew members in 
the Sioux City hospital that the fact that so many survived the crash of Flight 
232 "is a remarkable tribute to the expertise and courage of the crew, 
particularly the heroic flying skills of Capt. Haynes." 
</P>
<P>
Moments before the plane touched down in Sioux City, Haynes warned passengers 
that the landing would be difficult and flight attendants warned passengers to 
brace themselves. A few feet from the ground, the plane pitched suddenly to the 
right and the wing touched down, sending the craft into a fiery, cartwheel that 
split the fuselage into several huge pieces. Rescuers using a forklift found 
Haynes and his fellow crew members trapped in the cockpit, suffering 
lacerations on their heads and arms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Attendant Missing 
</P>
<P>
Among the flight attendants, United said that seven survived. One was still 
reported missing Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of one of the flight attendants recalled watching the disaster on 
television, certain that her daughter was among the crew. 
</P>
<P>
A few moments later, the phone rang, Jane Murray of Chester, S.C., recalled. It 
was her daughter, Virginia Jane, "telling me she was all right." 
</P>
<P>
"It was the sweetest news to my ears," Murray said. "We're just very grateful."

Air accident figures for the first six months of 1989 show a rising incidence 
of mechanical failure that caused nine of the 26 accidents this year in which 
606 people died, Flight International magazine reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing half-year figures relative to the decade as a whole, the magazine 
said that 1989 has been a poor year for airline safety. The figures appearing 
in the magazine's latest issue do not take into account the United Airlines 
DC-10 crash Wednesday in Sioux City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Flight International said 1985 held the decade's worst half-year with 913 
deaths and 21 accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths in 1989 compare with a decade half-year average of 439 and 
the accident count of 26 against a decade half-year figure of 17. This takes 
into account a 40% rise in the number of passenger journeys since the early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"If the 1989 first half-year figures are factored to accord with 1980 flying 
rates, the fatalities would have totalled 433 and the number of accidents would 
have been 19," the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the fatal accidents in 1989, 9 involved mechanical failure, 6 involved bad 
weather and pilot error was a factor in the remaining 14. 
</P>
<P>
"The mechanical failure figure is higher than usual," the magazine said. The 
threat of terrorism to airlines subsided in 1989, but whether this was a result 
of better security at airports or because terrorists had left aviation alone 
was unclear, it added. 
</P>
<P>
Britain tightened security at all major airports after the December bombing of 
a Pan Am Boeing 747 in Scotland, in which 270 people died.

BUSH'S CALL FOR MISSION TO MARS RECEIVES BROAD SUPPORT FROM SPACE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without spending a nickel, President Bush won widespread support from dissident 
elements of the space community Thursday when he committed the United States to 
embarking on a megabillion-dollar mission that will test human engineering and 
endurance to the limits. 
</P>
<P>
The manned expedition to Mars that the President endorsed is not simply a 
longer journey than a trip to the moon, which takes only about a day and a 
half. It could cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next three decades 
and the crew aboard the spacecraft would have to endure enormous risks during a 
voyage that would last between two and three years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those obstacles, leaders within the nation's space community hailed the 
President's proclamation because for the first time in more than a decade the 
United States has a goal in space exploration mandated from the top. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blueprint Remained Dormant 
</P>
<P>
"He has set our sights very clearly," said Thomas O. Paine, head of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration during the Apollo moon landings 
and the chief architect of a congressionally mandated blueprint for the future 
of the U.S. space program -- a blueprint that has remained dormant since it was 
submitted to the White House several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," said John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy 
Institute at George Washington University and a leading space analyst. "The 
President did exactly the right thing. He gave the kind of overall direction to 
why we are putting humans in space that so many have thought has been lacking." 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the President's speech, the nation's space community began 
healing some deep, self-inflicted wounds. Various factions have fought bitterly 
over which projects should get the highest priority, and that lack of unity has 
threatened to undermine congressional support for space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I have not been a chronic admirer of Republican presidents," said 
Caltech planetary scientist Bruce Murray, who directed the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory during one of its most productive periods. "But Bush said this is 
where we ought to go and that (sense of direction) has been the central problem 
since the end of Apollo." 
</P>
<P>
Like a number of other scientists across the country, Murray has been pushing 
for years for a manned expedition to Mars. He has consistently criticized plans 
to build a manned, orbiting space station, claiming that the $30-billion 
project -- which faces stiff opposition in Congress -- is just another piece of 
equipment, not a goal. 
</P>
<P>
That criticism softened considerably Thursday on the heels of the President's 
speech because the space station, like so many other projects in the space 
program, could play a role in any effort to send astronauts to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Friedman, executive director of the Pasadena-based Planetary Society and 
another outspoken critic of the space station, also eased his position after 
hearing Bush's speech. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest criticism of Bush's statement stemmed from the fact that he did 
not outline the role that other nations would have in a manned expedition to 
Mars, and many believe that only an international program is likely to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"International really means the Soviet Union," noted Murray, because the 
Soviets have the best information about the effects of long-term exposure to 
space. The record -- one year -- is held by a Soviet cosmonaut. 
</P>
<P>
A manned expedition to Mars would be costly, "probably hundreds of billions of 
dollars over a long period of time," but it's "not going to cost much extra 
over the next five years," Logsdon said. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed now, Friedman said, is to work out the details on how such a 
mission should be approached. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the projects that would be precursors to a Mars mission are already on 
the drawing boards. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is already developing plans 
for robotic, unmanned missions to Mars that would collect the information 
needed long before a manned expedition could be launched. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Space Station would serve as the beginning step toward a permanent 
manned presence in space. It would be followed by an "international spaceport" 
where large vehicles could be assembled in space so that they could be launched 
toward Mars without having to burn the fuel necessary to overcome Earth's 
gravity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knowledge of Mining 
</P>
<P>
A manned laboratory on the moon would allow astronauts to learn how to mine 
materials for permanent facilities, and possibly even extract oxygen and 
hydrogen from the lunar surface to fuel their rocket ships. 
</P>
<P>
Even if all of that could be carried out successfully over the next couple of 
decades, the actual trip to Mars would be filled with such profound challenges 
that it may be beyond human endurance. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years-long trip, the astronauts would be faced with the 
possibility of a meteoroid ripping through their spacecraft, causing rapid 
decompression that would kill them within seconds. 
</P>
<P>
A violent storm on the surface of the sun could blast the spacecraft with 
deadly radiation. So the craft would require some sort of storm shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout much of the trip, the craft would be so far from Earth that the 
astronauts would be pretty much on their own. It would take about 30 minutes 
for messages to travel back and forth between the craft and Earth by the time 
the astronauts reached the vicinity of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts would probably have to spend a year there, waiting for Mars to 
reach the right point in its orbit for them to launch themselves back toward 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
And it would take about a year to get back.

MICHELE MOLESE; NEW YORK CITY OPERA TENOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michele Molese, a tenor best known for his nearly two decades of appearances 
with the New York City Opera in which he sang most of the roles in the standard 
repertoire, has died in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported this week that he had died July 5 in Broni, Italy, 
at 60 after a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York, Molese studied in Italy, making his debut at the Teatro Nuovo 
in Milan in 1957. After singing in several other Italian opera houses and then 
joining the Belgrade Opera in Yugoslavia, he joined the New York City Opera in 
1964, making his debut as Pinkerton in "Madama Butterfly." He toured with the 
company and was a mainstay during the years when the company was Los Angeles' 
primary source of opera. 
</P>
<P>
He was noted for his strong voice and durability but once received more 
publicity over his temperament than his vocalizing. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times critic Harold Schonberg had written that Molese was guilty 
of squeezing some high notes during a particular performance. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, while singing in "A Masked Ball," the tenor hit a dramatic high C and 
received the customary applause and cheering. He stopped the performance, 
turned to the audience and said: 
</P>
<P>
"That pinched high C is for Mr. Schonberg." 
</P>
<P>
He was fired but later rehired by Julius Rudel, the company's general manager, 
and gave his last performance in 1980. Since retiring he had lived in Italy.

DRIVER WHO ALLEGEDLY WAVED GUN ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motorist with a car telephone called authorities after he said a man waved a 
pistol at him from another car on Interstate 10 near Yucaipa on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers later pulled over the alleged gunman's car, 
arrested the driver, William Worrell, 53, and confiscated a loaded .38-caliber 
revolver. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that whole thing of guns and traffic frustration starting all over 
again," San Bernardino County Sheriff's Deputy Ron Miller said. "The road 
narrowed from four to three lanes and this suspect thought he had been cut off 
and started waving his gun." 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said Worrell was booked on suspicion of brandishing a weapon and 
carrying a loaded weapon in a car.

WILL BRADLEY; BAND LEADER, TROMBONIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will Bradley, a handsome, urbane studio trombonist who emerged from those 
anonymous ranks to lead what briefly was one of the most celebrated Big Bands 
of the early and mid-1940s, has died. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported Thursday that Bradley, noted for such popular 
hits of the day as "Beat Me, Daddy, Eight to the Bar," "Celery Stalks at 
Midnight" and "Strange Cargo," died Saturday in Flemington, N.J. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
With drummer Ray McKinley, whom Bradley lured from Jimmy Dorsey, the Will 
Bradley Band was a mainstay of ballrooms and hotels during the wartime years of 
sentimental ballads, jive tunes and boogie-woogie. 
</P>
<P>
Called by Glenn Miller "the best of all" the trombonists of his day, Wilbur 
Schwichtenberg had worked for years in recording studios before emerging to 
join the old Milt Shaw and Ray Noble bands (Miller was a fellow trombonist with 
Noble). In 1939 Schwichtenberg became Bradley and Wilbur became Will and he and 
McKinley (considered a co-leader although he sat at the back of the band) 
produced a series of sweet ballads and swing tunes for Columbia records. 
</P>
<P>
With Freddie Slack at the piano the Bradley band recorded "I Don't Stand a 
Ghost of a Chance," with Carlotta Dale on vocal, and "Old Doc Yak," with 
McKinley singing and playing drums. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Tobin, then Harry James' wife, sang "Deed I Do" with Bradley shortly 
before the band switched emphasis from ballads to boogie. 
</P>
<P>
Slack, later to form his own famous band, was the catalyst behind a white group 
of musicians playing what had been a black innovation. 
</P>
<P>
In George T. Simons' book "The Big Bands," McKinley recounts how the musicians 
were experimenting with instrumental arrangements based on the blues with an 
eight-to-the-bar piano boogie beat. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one point where I had a drum break and for some reason or other that 
night instead of playing the break, I sang out "Oh, beat me, daddy, eight to 
the bar!" After the set McKinley encouraged the writing of a song with that 
title and it became the biggest of the Bradley band's hits, selling more than 
100,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley tried to chase that success with "Rock-a-Bye Boogie," "Scrub Me, Mama, 
With a Boogie Beat," "Fry Me, Cookie, With a Can of Lard" and others. 
</P>
<P>
But he quickly became disenchanted with the band's new sound, preferring the 
more solid tunes of the day, and he and McKinley eventually split up, McKinley 
to form his own group in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley brought new talent into his band after McKinley's departure, among them 
a young drummer named Shelley Manne and a trumpet player who called himself 
Shorty Rogers. These two were to become an integral part of modern jazz a few 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
But the wartime military draft decimated the ranks of the younger players and 
Simon writes of one engagement in Detroit in which Bradley told him that six 
musicians moved from the bandstand to the recruiting station in a single week. 
</P>
<P>
After that Bradley was forced to cancel many of his personal appearances and 
rely on studio musicians for recordings. Bradley himself soon returned to the 
studios where he had started. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Joan, a son, a daughter and a grandson.

VALENTI REFUSES HIS VOTE IN PUSHING CAMPAIGN AGAINST FILM PRESERVATION BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress' decision last year to create a film preservation board failed to 
dampen Hollywood's internal brawls over colorizing black-and-white movies. Now 
those emotional battles have spilled onto the board itself. 
</P>
<P>
At this week's meeting of the 7-month-old National Film Preservation Board, 
Jack Valenti, president of the powerful Motion Picture Assn. of America, 
continued his fight against the creation of the board -- even though he was 
appointed as one of its 13 members. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti, who opposes any government attempts to tell the film studios he 
represents how to handle their movies, complained about the preservation 
board's primary legal duty to designate 25 films annually as "national 
treasures." The films chosen must carry warning labels if they are colorized or 
substantially altered from the original version. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think it's appropriate for governmentally appointed bodies to 
pick pictures," Valenti told fellow preservation board members at a Wednesday 
meeting on the UCLA campus. Because of his decades-long opposition to 
government interference in cultural matters, Valenti added, he is abstaining 
from voting on the list of 25 films. 
</P>
<P>
Movie fans won't gain any insights into how those 25 films were chosen because 
the board cut short its public meeting to discuss its selections behind closed 
doors. The board's list of 25 recommendations -- which it plans to keep under 
wraps -- will be sent on to the Librarian of Congress, James Billington, who 
has final say over the selections. Billington, who will release his final 
decision in late September, attended Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The board -- which originally received 960 nominations from among themselves 
and the public -- had earlier narrowed its choices to a list of 57 that 
included such classics as "The Grapes of Wrath," "Casablanca," "It's a 
Wonderful Life," "The Best Years of Our Lives," "Citizen Kane" and "On the 
Waterfront." 
</P>
<P>
Valenti's decision to abstain from voting prompted protests from board member 
Charles Milne of New York University's Department of Cinema Studies, who urged 
Valenti to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
From the audience, director Elliot Silverstein, a vocal opponent of 
colorization, suggested that Valenti relinquish his seat to a representative 
from the American Society of Cinematographers, whose leadership was on hand to 
complain about their exclusion from the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed to hear that you are abstaining . . . keeping one of the 13 
seats inert," Silverstein told Valenti. "What is service if it does not include 
voting?" 
</P>
<P>
Simmering beneath Valenti's stated political philosophies and Silverstein's 
procedural concerns is the ongoing debate over whether film makers should 
maintain artistic control over their movies after they are released. 
</P>
<P>
Silverstein and other leaders of the Directors Guild of America have fought 
hard in Congress to gain the authority to prevent their films from being 
colorized or substantially edited over film makers' objections. Valenti has 
vigorously fought those efforts at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
DGA's push for creation of the National Film Preservation Board was a first, if 
weak, step in that direction. This fall, the guild plans to press for 
legislation to give film makers the "moral right" to protect their work from 
changes that might damage their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
Fay Kanin, former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
and chairman of the board, defended the group's activities to Valenti. "I feel 
a great sense of pride that at last this country is honoring motion pictures," 
she said. "If nothing else, we're doing more to draw attention to the 
preservation of film." 
</P>
<P>
Billington noted that government artistic support in the United States is a 
well-established tradition, citing the National Endowments for the Arts and 
Humanities. "The U.S. also picks a poet laureate, which seems on the whole a 
positive thing," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the response to his remarks, Valenti refused to budge from his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
The board's discussion during its public session pointed up the difficulties of 
choosing 25 films as national treasures. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rosen, UCLA's film archivist, expressed concern that a list of 25 would 
"suggest that others which didn't make the list are somehow less worthy." He 
urged the board to strive to represent less popular categories such as 
documentaries, film noir and silent films. 
</P>
<P>
But NYU's Milne argued for a more "populist" approach, "picking films that are 
loved by the public because of what those films have meant to the public -- how 
they spoke to us when they were released and how they continue to speak to us 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Hiller, president of the Directors Guild, said that the board should 
lean not only toward those movies that are in danger of destruction because of 
aging, but also toward those that "are not being seen in the way intended by 
the artist." The latter remark was a veiled reference to the growing 
colorization of classic films.

NETWORKS AIR CRONKITE AD LAUDING 'FREE TV' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The National Assn. of Broadcasters estimated Thursday that 54 million viewers 
on Monday night saw its 30-second commercial in which former CBS anchorman 
Walter Cronkite praised so-called "free" TV. 
</P>
<P>
The ad, which ABC, NBC, CBS and an estimated 1,000 TV stations aired at the 
start of prime time, according to the NAB, marked the start of two major 
broadcast industry campaigns to counter the inroads of cable TV in the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
However, the NAB commercial was vaguely worded. It saluted "free," or 
over-the-air, television, but did not criticize cable, for which subscribers 
pay a monthly fee averaging $24 for basic service. 
</P>
<P>
With a theme of "Free TV . . . an American Tradition," the ad opened with 
Cronkite advising viewers that "what you are watching is called free 
television. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Through your free-TV window," he continued, "you've been witness to triumph 
and tragedy, to love, laughter, learning, life. It's offered free to all -- 
even the cable systems that carry it. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine the impact if it were gone. Join us in the coming months as we 
celebrate and stand watch over free TV." 
</P>
<P>
A cable industry executive who declined to be identified said Thursday he 
thought the ad was part of an NAB effort to influence Congress to adopt 
"must-carry" legislation requiring cable-TV operators to carry over-the-air 
television signals on their channels. 
</P>
<P>
The NAB and its cable counterpart, the National Cable Television Assn., have 
been trying to work out a deal on such legislation that they then would suggest 
to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's Cronkite commercial was produced by CBS for the NAB's Free Television 
Task Force.

ACCORD REACHED ON WAYS TO PRESERVE HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FELICIA PAIK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Studio/Preservation Task Force announced a set of recommendations Thursday 
to preserve historically significant Hollywood studios while enabling movie 
companies to keep the cameras rolling. 
</P>
<P>
"The studios will be able to develop and grow, and at the same time 
historically and architecturally significant buildings will be preserved," 
Councilman Michael Woo, whose 13th District includes Hollywood, said at a press 
conference at Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The task force was established last year by Woo to resolve a conflict created 
when Hollywood Center Studios sought to demolish seismically unsafe buildings 
and was blocked by preservationists. Members include representatives of studios 
in Woo's district, such as Paramount, Raleigh and Hollywood Center, and of such 
preservationist groups as Hollywood Heritage and Los Angeles Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations include a survey over the coming months to determine which 
buildings or sites are worthy of protection, Woo said. Studio members of the 
task force have agreed not to demolish or significantly alter buildings 
identified by the survey as historically significant without task-force 
approval, while preservationist members will not object to reversible or 
interior alterations to such buildings. The proposals allow for placement of a 
plaque on a designated building and a listing on the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
"With these recommendations in place, we can preserve Hollywood's precious past 
without sacrificing its future," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Hillary Gitelman, executive director of Hollywood Heritage, echoed Woo's 
remarks: "It looks as if historic preservation and good business can be 
accomplished with the same actions." FELICIA PAIK

Talked out and seemingly bored with the issue, the Legislature urged Congress 
to enact a constitutional amendment to protect the American flag against 
desecration. In contrast to long and emotional debates earlier, a pair of flag 
protection petitions addressed to Congress and President Bush was 
overwhelmingly whipped out of the Assembly and Senate without debate in less 
than two minutes. Congress is considering such an amendment in the wake of a 
U.S. Supreme Court decision that held that burning the flag as a form of 
political protest is protected by the constitutional right to free speech.

2 GROUPS SEEK RECALL OF BONO

Charging that Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono has reneged on campaign promises, 
members of two citizens' groups -- Save Palm Springs and Citizens of Palm 
Springs -- have joined forces to seek the recall of the 
celebrity-turned-politician. Critics charge that Bono, 54, who was elected in 
April, 1988, failed to take decisive steps to revitalize the city's struggling 
downtown and has been inaccessible to the public, despite his pledge to 
maintain an "open-door" policy. Dick Sroda, one of five people who signed an 
"intent-to-recall" letter mailed to Bono, also accused the mayor of using the 
office to promote his acting career. Bono was en route to Hawaii and 
unavailable for comment. Proponents of recalling Bono must gather 4,060 
signatures to qualify the measure.

America's major veterans groups, armed with a new poll, called on Congress to 
act quickly to protect the flag from desecration. At the same time, a former 
prisoner of war cautioned members of a House Judiciary subcommittee to not 
damage the Constitution because of the flag issue. Members of the American 
Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Disabled American Veterans presented 
initial results of a Gallup Poll that found 66% favor a constitutional 
amendment. The survey was taken July 7-17 and included 272 respondents. But 
James Warner, a former Marine flight officer who was held as a prisoner in 
Vietnam for 5 1/2 years, argued that while desecration of the flag caused him 
"immeasurable pain," the Constitution should not be tampered with.

An Egyptian court sentenced a U.S. citizen in absentia to five years in prison 
at hard labor for allegedly recruiting Egyptians to spy on Muslim militants on 
behalf of U.S. intelligence. The indictment named the American as Nicholas 
Edward Reynolds and said he was an officer in the CIA. The court also sentenced 
Sami Youssef Ibrahim and his brother, Samir, who is still at large, to 10 years 
each for passing on information detrimental to Egypt's national interests. 
Defense attorney Maurice Sadq said the case was invented by Egypt's 
intelligence services in order to exchange Sami for an American-Egyptian 
engineer facing security charges in the United States.

PANEL REJECTS BID TO KILL MEDICARE SURTAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A House tax panel voted not to repeal the 1988 catastrophic illness insurance 
program that has brought protests from senior citizens groups over its 
income-based surtax to pay for increased benefits. The House Ways and Means 
Committee, meeting behind closed doors, also took no action on a proposal to 
slash, from 28% to 15%, the capital gains tax on the sale of assets, as 
President Bush has requested. Democratic leaders oppose the capital gains tax 
cut and have urged Democrats on the tax-writing panel to keep the tax at its 
current level. The panel defeated an amendment by Rep. Brian Donnelly (D-Mass.) 
and others to repeal the catastrophic illness insurance program passed last 
year. The law requires that senior citizens foot the bill for greatly expanded 
Medicare benefits.

India's opposition parties brought Parliament to a halt for a second day, 
demanding that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi resign over bribes they allege were 
paid in a major defense deal. The opposition insisted that Gandhi quit after 
the government auditor and comptroller general pointed out serious lapses in 
selecting Swedish Bofors artillery in a 1986 contract worth $1.3 billion. The 
opposition forced adjournments in both the lower and upper house by stalling 
scheduled business. The Bofors scandal last year seriously dented Gandhi's 
popularity following widespread allegations that commissions were paid to 
middlemen despite an agreement with the Swedish company that no agents would be 
used.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin said he wants a "cold turkey" 
freeze on funds for the stealth bomber, and President Bush stepped up his 
lobbying effort for the radar-evading plane and other defense systems. Aspin, a 
Democrat from Wisconsin, said Congress needs more information on the costly 
stealth bomber, as the B-2 plane is known. Meanwhile, Bush called Aspin and 
other members of the House Armed Services and Appropriations committees to the 
White House, pressing them to back his budget proposals for the B-2, as well as 
the strategic defense initiative, the MX missile and the Midgetman missile. The 
House and Senate are scheduled to vote next week on those programs.

14 years. A Soviet cruiser, a destroyer and an oiler will dock at U.S. Atlantic 
Fleet headquarters this morning for a four-day good will visit. It will be only 
the second Soviet naval port call in the United States since World War II and 
the first since a Boston visit in 1975. At that time, U.S. Navy ships also

Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates on Thursday vowed to lobby an Assembly committee to 
win approval for a bill that would allow Orange County to ask voters to 
consider a half-cent sales tax increase next year for new jail and courthouse 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and other supporters of a new jail at Gypsum Canyon, one of the projects 
that would be advanced by such a tax, hit a roadblock Wednesday, when the 
Assembly Local Government Committee decided to combine the county measure, 
sponsored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), with three similar 
bills and take them up as a package after legislators return from their summer 
break in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
That would make it more difficult for lawmakers to pass the tax increase before 
the Sept. 15 adjournment and would lessen chances that the issue could be 
placed on county ballots in June, 1990, Bergeson said. 
</P>
<P>
A half-cent tax would generate an estimated $121 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's chairman, Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose), said he 
wanted the delay to examine similar proposals in Los Angeles, Riverside and 
Humboldt counties to make sure that they would be constitutional if approved by 
the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Dominic Cortese doesn't play God with the rest of state," Gates said 
Thursday. "We're going to be working extra hard to get him to change his mind." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the jail site, who say building a facility at the canyon would 
be too costly and disrupt nearby neighborhoods, said the delay is a sign that 
the measure is not feasible in a county that tends to vote against increased 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth, who opposed the Gypsum Canyon site near Anaheim Hills 
when the Board of Supervisors voted, 3-2, in July, 1987, to build a new jail 
there, repeated his opposition Thursday and expressed doubt that county voters 
would approve such a tax anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great doubts that the people will vote for it," said Roth, who 
represents Anaheim. "I don't think this thing is going anywhere anyway." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roth Cites Costs 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he opposes the new jail site because of its cost. The first phase 
would cost $300 million, excluding the price of the land, he said. Buying the 
site would increase the cost by at least another $30 million -- providing that 
the Irvine Co., which owns much of the land around the site, agrees to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's irresponsible to spend millions on a site we don't own," Roth said. "I 
can't support a jail in Gypsum Canyon because it doesn't make economical 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's bill is considered by county officials to be the only politically 
viable option to help solve a jail overcrowding crisis that Gates has estimated 
will force him to give early release to thousands of prisoners each year. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and the county are under a federal court order to relieve overcrowding in 
existing jails. 
</P>
<P>
"I need a facility," Gates said Thursday. "I can't do my job." 
</P>
<P>
Residents oppose building a jail at the canyon site and have qualified an 
initiative for the June, 1990, ballot that would restrict new jail construction 
to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Impact on Values, Study Says 
</P>
<P>
But a recent county report predicted that the proposed 6,720-inmate, 
maximum-security jail would have no impact on surrounding property values or 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I would challenge anyone to show me where in the county the property values 
haven't gone up," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who supports the site, 
said he hopes that the bill will be passed by the Legislature and signed by the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a happy situation, but I still somehow have the faith that this 
situation in the Assembly committee can be resolved," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rick Violett, president of the citizens group Taxpayers for a Centralized 
Jail, said the delay in Sacramento could force county officials to build jails 
with other counties in areas isolated from residential neighborhoods or to 
construct one next to county court facilities in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to put it on the ballot, it had better be a decent plan," 
Violett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Berguson to Keep Pushing 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson, returning from the capital Thursday, pledged to continue pushing the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an apparent awareness (on the Assembly panel) that we're unhappy with 
the decision," she said. "It can't be put on the back burner. . . . That's 
totally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
The senator warned that the bill, which expires if not passed before 
legislators break, is not specific to the Gypsum Canyon site. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to keep the site neutral," Bergeson said. "The point is, we're 
releasing hard-core criminals, and that's fast becoming a health and safety 
crisis."

<P>
ALLEGED PLOT TO KILL PROSECUTORS DETAILED

<P>
When Anaheim Hills computer entrepreneur David A. Brown placed a collect call 
from jail to an ex-inmate on the morning of Feb. 13, he got the news he seemed 
to have been awaiting for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"David, it's done!" an excited Richard Steinhart told Brown in one of their 
several dozen telephone conversations in early February. "Bang, bang -- right 
in the back of the head," Steinhart said. 
</P>
<P>
"It," prosecutors allege, was the supposed murder of two officials in the 
Orange County district attorney's office, two men central to Brown's 
prosecution on charges of orchestrating his wife's 1985 murder. 
</P>
<P>
It was a lie. In fact, both Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey Robinson and 
investigator Jay Newell were safe and sound, tipped off well in advance to the 
alleged plot with the aid of Steinhart himself, acting as an informant. 
</P>
<P>
But to Brown, the words seemed to be just what he wanted to hear. 
</P>
<P>
"Wonderful! You're a good man," Brown told Steinhart, according to copies of 
audio tapes obtained by The Times. Brown, while cautioning that he could not 
say much because of the jail's close confines, added: "You did great. . . . 
You're fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
The conversation climaxed weeks of elaborate planning in which, prosecutors 
allege, the 36-year-old Brown to tried to clear himself of the charges of 
arranging the murder of his wife by paying for the killings of three key 
figures in his prosecution, gaining perjured testimony from a female inmate, 
and making it appear as though he himself was a target for assault. 
</P>
<P>
But unknown to Brown, investigators had persuaded Steinhart to cooperate after 
learning of the alleged scheme. Then they tape-recorded the Feb. 13 
conversation, along with several dozen that preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
These tapes, laying out the alleged scheme publicly for the first time in 
intricate detail, form the crux of the added charges brought against Brown in 
February of soliciting the murders of Robinson, Newell and Patti Bailey -- 
Brown's current wife and now a key witness against him in the pending murder 
case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tapes 'Absolutely Crucial' 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Borris, prosecuting the new charges against Brown, said 
of the tapes: "They are absolutely critical to us. Brown's own words 
incriminate him beyond any doubt; those tapes are our case." 
</P>
<P>
But Brown's attorneys indicated they may try to use parts of the tapes when the 
return to Superior Court today to seek the removal of the district attorney's 
office from the case on grounds of conflict of interest. The tapes, they argue, 
show that Brown held a personal grudge against Robinson and Newell, and that 
the case should be turned over to unbiased state prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's lawyers further argue that the tapes do not tell the whole story, that 
Brown was set up by jailhouse informants -- Steinhart and Joseph Drake, a past 
jailhouse informant of questionable credibility -- who sought to win the good 
graces of prosecutors by tipping them off to the plot. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent jail interview with The Times, Brown said he took part in the 
attempted murder scheme only under intimidation by Drake and Steinhart. "They 
threatened me and my daughter. I had no choice." 
</P>
<P>
In the original case against him, Brown stands accused of orchestrating the 
1985 murder of his wife, Linda Brown, 24, who was shot twice as she slept at 
their Garden Grove home. Prosecutors allege that Brown set up his teen-age 
daughter to take the fall for the crime, while he collected $835,000 from the 
victim's life insurance policies and married Bailey, Linda Brown's younger 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, 21, and the daughter, Cinnamon Brown, 18 -- incarcerated for the last 4 
years in a California Youth Authority facility for the murder -- are both key 
witnesses against Brown in the case. Bailey, in apparent recognition of her 
cooperation, was recently allowed to plead guilty as a juvenile to murder 
charges, rather than face the far stiffer penalty that an adult conviction 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talk With 'Smiley Face' 
</P>
<P>
The new charges against Brown also center on his alleged plan to have Bailey 
killed, then to pay another inmate to come forward and tell authorities that 
Bailey had admitted lying about her testimony against Brown. 
</P>
<P>
In a tape-recorded telephone conversation on Feb. 8, Brown spoke with a woman 
inmate known as "Smiley Face," who actually was an undercover district 
attorney's investigator. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, going over plans to lie after Bailey's planned murder, told Brown 
she understood she was to "tell (authorities) that Patti's not telling the 
truth. I'm supposed to say she's lying." 
</P>
<P>
Brown maintained in the conversation that "I am innocent, I swear to God. I am 
innocent" of the 1985 murder of his wife, and that Bailey was testifying 
against him only because "she wants my money." Brown, who started an apparently 
successful service retrieving data from damaged computer systems, told the 
undercover agent he is worth "over $5 million." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his claims of innocence, Brown cautioned the woman that she could not 
tell his lawyers about their plans and that she would not get caught "if you do 
it right." According to the tape transcripts, he added: "I'll make it worth 
your while. . . . I take care of people; that's how I managed to get ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement investigators say both Brown and Steinhart -- who is trained in 
martial arts and has been arrested several times on drug charges -- proceeded 
initially in earnest with their murder scheme. It was only after Drake tipped 
investigators to the plot that Steinhart agreed to cooperate and play along 
with the plot under surveillance, the investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks before completion of the district attorney's sting, prosecutors 
said that Brown arranged for his brother, Tom Brown of Long Beach, to make cash 
deliveries totaling $11,700 to Steinhart and a man called "Animal," who was 
actually a police investigator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan to Burn Van 
</P>
<P>
The tapes reveal that Brown and Steinhart also discussed tentative plans for 
Brown to escape from jail and for Steinhart to set fire to Brown's van and 
perhaps his home to make it appear as if Brown was the target of violence. 
Investigators say that Brown, while in jail, had increased his home insurance, 
allegedly in an effort to collect more money from the proposed arson. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of the supposed "hit," Brown had his brother deliver an 
additional $10,000 for expenses. The bulk of the cash delivered came from a 
trust fund overseen by Brown's attorney, Baruch, investigators say. The 
attorney has told investigators that he did not know the real purpose of the 
money when he signed over its release to Tom Brown. 
</P>
<P>
As Tom Brown delivered the $10,000 on the morning of Feb. 13, he was seized by 
waiting police, who told him he was under arrest for murder. But Tom Brown told 
investigators that he, too, did not know the real purpose of the money. He was 
never charged in the scheme.

TEEN'S INDIAN HERITAGE MAY ALTER ADOPTION OF HER BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLISON SAMUELS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Argleben spends her mornings attending summer classes to complete her 
junior year of high school. She does as much studying as possible while in 
class, because when she goes home she must care for her 5-week-old baby girl. 
</P>
<P>
The high school student realized early that it would be difficult to both care 
for a child and complete her education. So when she learned of her pregnancy 
last September, she and her family, who live in Cypress, immediately began 
preparing for the baby's adoption. 
</P>
<P>
A family friend arranged with a couple in New York to adopt the baby, and plans 
proceeded. The couple's lawyer alerted the Arglebens, Joan's adopted family, 
that because the 18-year-old is an Aleut Indian, a 1978 federal law gives her 
Alaskan Indian tribe the right to raise the child if she decides not to. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, Aaron Britvan, sent a letter about the adoption to the Alaskan 
tribe and plans for the adoption proceeded. In June, a day before the baby was 
born in New York, Britvan received a letter saying the tribe had found an 
Indian family to raise the child. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened so all of a sudden," said Judith Argleben, Joan's mother. "I got a 
phone call the day after the baby was born in New York to buy a ticket for my 
daughter because she and the baby were coming home. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought when we adopted Joan that we had severed the ties she had with the 
tribe. Now we found out that they have say in her life 15 years later." 
</P>
<P>
Joan doesn't understand how the law can apply to her. She was 3 when she and 
her sister were taken from their tribe. Later, they were adopted by the 
Arglebens, who aren't Indian. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not raised in an Indian culture, and that was no one's concern," Joan 
said. "Now, how my baby is raised is. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I know what is right for me and my child and no else should have 
the right to interfere." 
</P>
<P>
The federal law exercised by the Aleut tribe is aimed at preventing the breakup 
of Indian families and to ensure the right of American Indian children to 
develop an Indian identity. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, it's a constitutional imbalance," Britvan said. "We understand 
everything the Indians have and are going through, and we're not trying to take 
away from that. All we're saying is, 'What about the mother's constitutional 
rights of what she wants for her child?' " 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Trope, staff attorney for the Assn. of American Indian Affairs, a 
nonprofit advocacy group based in New York, said Joan relinquished her rights 
when she decided to give her child up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
"The constant criticism of this act is that it doesn't recognize the mother's 
wishes. But when she decides to give the child up, she does not have a say-so 
in his life," Trope said. "No court decides what's the best for a child solely 
on a mother's wishes, Indian or not. The tribe isn't as concerned with what the 
mother wants as it is about what is best for the child." 
</P>
<P>
Trope added that research strongly indicates Indian children don't fare well in 
non-Indian homes. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1970s, one out of four Indian children were placed outside of an Indian 
environment," he said. "And what eventually happens is that a large amount of 
these kids get about 18 or older and realize they're very unhappy and confused. 
</P>
<P>
"Then they try to get to know about themselves and their Indian heritage, but 
it's hard because most don't have contacts with their own culture." 
</P>
<P>
Despite what may be a long and expensive court battle, Joan still wants the New 
York family to raise the daughter she has unofficially named Rebecca. She is 
trying to find a lawyer to challenge the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it will be hard giving her up after this time, I know it is best," 
Joan said. "I remind myself that I cannot give her the things she needs and 
should have." 
</P>
<P>
Joan, her mother said, "shouldn't have to go through this. She knows what's 
best for the child. And she knows that she needs time to finish school and 
begin her life. You can't do that and take care of a child."

FIRE COMMISSION BACKS CHIEF IN PARAMEDIC FEUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles fire commissioners backed Fire Chief Donald O. Manning on Thursday 
over a paramedics union chief who had called for the chief's ouster and claimed 
that improvements in the city's Emergency Medical Service system were not being 
made quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We . . . are troubled by the call for the chief's resignation," Commissioner 
Ann Reiss Lane, senior member of the commission and its newly elected 
president, said after a review of the Fire Department's actions in improving 
Emergency Medical Service over the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"The narrow view of the (United Paramedics of Los Angeles) president," she 
added, "and his gratuitous comments to the press and the commission do not in 
any way improve medical services to the citizens of Los Angeles or contribute 
to the improvement of patient care." 
</P>
<P>
Lane said that the city provides "outstanding quality care." What will improve 
medical services and patient care is for unions representing Fire Department 
firefighters and paramedics to cooperate in resolving differences, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hurtado, president of the 421-member United Paramedics, touched off the 
controversy late last month with charges that the Fire Department has been 
"unacceptably slow" in making improvements recommended after a study of the 
emergency medical system's performance over a decade. He accused management of 
"foot-dragging." 
</P>
<P>
While noting that improvements have been made, Hurtado has insisted that 
response times are "too long in many cases" and that paramedics are still 
overworked in some sectors of the city. He claimed that fire-suppression 
elements of the Fire Department have been slow to embrace Emergency Medical 
Service because they fear their status and mission will be diminished. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gains Cited 
</P>
<P>
Ordered by the Fire Commission to summarize emergency improvements, Manning 
offered a report citing, among other things, an increase in paramedic rescue 
ambulances from 42 to 48, implementation of priority dispatch protocols to 
improve responses, and the addition of nine rescue ambulances staffed by 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Manning also noted at the commission meeting Thursday that 11 fire companies 
have been equipped with automatic defibrillators to be used in heart attack 
cases. And he said the department plans to equip all 117 of its engine 
companies with the instruments by next year, if budgeting permits. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm particularly pleased with the results," said Manning, in assessing his 
department's Emergency Medical Service progress. "I don't mean to tell you that 
I'm content. I'm pointing out that we have made some tremendous progress." 
</P>
<P>
Reached later by telephone, Hurtado reiterated his charge that the reaction of 
Fire Department management to a decade of reports and recommendations on 
emergency service has been "begrudging, untimely, unnecessarily slow and poorly 
managed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quality Question 
</P>
<P>
When the question of the quality of management has arisen in the past, Hurtado 
said, it has been "standard practice" for the fire commissioners and the chief 
to stand up and say, "No, no. Our paramedics do a wonderful job." 
</P>
<P>
Hurtado added: "In our view, this is simply a ploy to sidestep the fundamental 
issue that we have continually raised. The fundamental issue is management. . . 
. We have no reason to be proud of the management that is supposed to support 
us. Ann Lane knows better." 
</P>
<P>
Manning characterized Hurtado's demand for his ouster as "ridiculous."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORE SCRUTINY URGED FOR PANEL CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors have agreed to explore ways to ensure that 
applicants seeking appointments to county commissions submit accurate resumes, 
but the panel stopped short of ordering Sheriff's Department background checks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the sheriff has enough to do to catch criminals," said Supervisor Ed 
Edelman. And Supervisor Pete Schabarum called the measure "a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana proposed considering complete background checks on 
prospective commission members after one of his appointees was arrested on 
forgery charges and traffic warrants. Dana said this week that he recently 
received a completely false resume. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum and Kenneth Hahn pointedly noted that the effort to find people 
willing to serve on commissions begins with personal knowledge of their 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors agreed on a 3-1 vote to instruct the county's chief 
administrative officer and the county counsel to explore ways of improving the 
application procedure and report their findings within 30 days.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEADERSHIP TRAINING FOR LATINO YOUTHS SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre and film producer Moctesuma 
Esparza have announced that a community educational group will hold leadership 
training sessions this year for Latino high school students as one way to lower 
the school dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
Both Alatorre and Esparza attended similar conferences in the late 1960s and 
early '70s. The goal of the conferences, Esparza said, will be to motivate and 
train students who have demonstrated leadership ability and students who might 
be on the verge of dropping out of school. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre and Moctesuma are members of the governing board of the National 
Hispanic Arts, Educational and Media Institute, which will sponsor a Latino 
music special Aug. 3 to raise funds for the leadership conferences. 
</P>
<P>
At a Los Angeles press conference on Wednesday, the two also unveiled an 
"educational bill of rights" and called for more effective teaching methods, 
better teacher-student ratios, bilingual and bicultural programs, greater 
financial support and other programs.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $15-MILLION PAYMENT IN BIG ROCK CASE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Assembly on Thursday overwhelmingly gave final approval to a bill to set 
aside $15 million -- the state's final share -- to settle lawsuits stemming 
from a 1983 landslide in the Big Rock Mesa area of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who represents the district, 
was approved by a 71-0 margin and now goes to Gov. George Deukmejian for his 
signature. The governor's press secretary, Kevin Brett, said Deukmejian intends 
to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's action was a step toward completing a $97-million settlement between 
the state, Los Angeles County and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Transportation was found liable by a Superior Court 
jury of contributing to the landslide by cutting through a hillside to build 
Pacific Coast Highway. The state's share of the settlement is $40 million, of 
which $25 million was paid last year. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who handled the bill 
on the Assembly floor, said, "I think this matter is put to rest."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 FUGITIVES, 3 TONS OF MARIJUANA SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two fugitives identified as ringleaders in an international drug smuggling 
operation have been arrested and authorities have seized three tons of 
marijuana valued at $9.6 million, U.S. Customs agents announced Thursday in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, William Joseph Richards, 37, of Malibu, and Thomas Joseph Gaglia, 
42, of Palm Desert, were arrested Wednesday night as they were separating 
10-pound blocks of marijuana from a shipment of teak flooring tiles from 
Thailand, Customs agent Ed Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, who allegedly goes by the alias of William Myles Steele, and Gaglia, 
reportedly also known as Auguste Cassini, were wanted in San Diego on various 
felony charges related to cocaine dealing, Adamson said. He described them as 
"kingpins in a major narcotics smuggling organization." 
</P>
<P>
Agents on Thursday continued serving 15 federal search warrants, a process that 
was expected to continue over the next few days at various locations in the Los 
Angeles area, as authorities seek to uncover financial records that might be 
connected with the drug smuggling operation, Adamson said.

COUGAR SEIZED AT HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
CUTE CUB CAN'T COUNT AS KITTY

<P>
Animal control officers Duncan Gill and Carl Pagano went to a house in Irvine 
this week and found a cat sitting in the window. 
</P>
<P>
But they knew immediately that it was no ordinary feline. 
</P>
<P>
It was a 12-week-old mountain lion. 
</P>
<P>
The officers had received an anonymous tip that a resident of the house on 
Willowbrook in the Woodbridge area had bragged about keeping the female cub -- 
named Sheena -- as a pet. 
</P>
<P>
State law, however, makes housing any "species of carnivore other than domestic 
dogs and cats" a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and $1,000 
in fines, according to Mary Jean Delong, a dispatcher for Irvine Animal 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
So, Gill and Pagano proceeded to seize the cat. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the officers arrived, another resident of the house -- not the cat's 
owner -- drove up and let them in. The cub was playing in front of the window 
and making a bird-like chirping sound, which the officers said is typical for 
cats that age. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we went inside, it took a few minutes to catch the cat," Gill said. "It 
was loose throughout the house." 
</P>
<P>
The cub, which is believed to have come from Florida, had been declawed and 
isn't dangerous, Gill said, adding that he didn't know how the cub had been 
obtained. A mountain lion can grow to weigh about 200 pounds and about 34 
inches in height, he said. 
</P>
<P>
State Fish and Game wardens will determine if charges are warranted against the 
cat's owner, whose name Gill declined to release on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the house appeared to be shared by four men, all in their 20s. They 
probably had the mountain lion "for the novelty of it," Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
The cub will stay at the Irvine Animal Care Center until Saturday, Gill said. 
Then it will be taken to a zoo or wildlife facility in Riverside County.

Ushica Hall may never play golf again. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-year-old hit her ball inch by inch Thursday across 12 feet of turf. The 
trouble was, the golf club was her nose. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it," she said. "It's too hard." 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was Santa Ana's sixth annual Wacky Olympics, in which 150 children 
ages 6 to 12 competed for ribbons and prestige at El Salvador Park. 
</P>
<P>
Put on by the city's Recreation and Community Services Agency, the Wacky 
Olympics gives out-of-school kids the chance to participate in seven unorthodox 
sports, such as the golf-ball race, a balloon toss, an obstacle course, a 
peanut toss and a one-legged long jump. 
</P>
<P>
"It's based on the Olympic-style events," organizer Pearl Soria said. "We try 
to make it as wacky as possible. They are Olympic-type events done in a wacky, 
fun way." 
</P>
<P>
The event, which drew children from 10 of the city's parks and recreation 
centers, gives youngsters a chance to meet others from throughout Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the game mirrors the real Olympics. The opening ceremonies 
featured a parade, with teams representing mock countries such as Mad Ball 
City, the Jordan Jungle and the Arabian Nights. "Batman" was well represented 
by the Gotham City and Bat Land teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Wacky Olympics even included the traditional running of the torch -- a 
construction cone -- and a special oath. But the pomp and pageantry did not 
detract from the real reason the kids were there. 
</P>
<P>
And before the competitors got too antsy, Soria declared: "Let the wackiness 
begin." 
</P>
<P>
There was the obstacle course, in which competitors had to crawl through 
tunnels, run over tires and slide down a water-soaked plastic sheet. 
</P>
<P>
Amado Nuncio, 10, was the first to make it through the course in a little more 
than 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get to the third cone, then we dive," he said, his hair and shirt 
dripping with water. "It's fun when you go slipping." 
</P>
<P>
At the peanut toss, in which upright competitors get three tries to see how far 
they can throw peanuts back through their legs, kids had high hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be famous," said Stephanie Rosas, 10, after tossing a nut several 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
The golf-ball race seemed to have the toughest rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Nose, nose, no head!" shouted supervisor Carolyn Jimerson as Gary Sabara, 10, 
crawled along the grass. 
</P>
<P>
The rules might have been tough, but Gary still had more success than most. He 
finished the race in 43 seconds, way ahead of Ushica and other competitors.

POLICE ARRIVE -- AND THIS TIME THEY'LL STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time Los Angeles police tried to open an outpost station at the 
Imperial Courts housing project in Watts, a late-night firebombing delayed the 
start-up. 
</P>
<P>
That was last April. Two more times, arsonists came calling as police scheduled 
and then had to reschedule the opening of the prototype security post designed 
to protect tenants in housing project. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, the embattled outpost was finally christened at an open house at 
which officers handed out balloons and baseball cards to children, and city 
officials served up words of encouragement to residents "who want to take back 
the housing project from gangs and drug users." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents at Thursday's opening said they welcome the stepped-up 
security although some were critical of past police methods. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all for police protection," said Bennie Ford, 50, a ship welder who lives 
on Grape Street, half a block from the substation. "It's pretty rowdy in here." 
</P>
<P>
Ford said neighborhood police patrols are often absent when violence breaks out 
and, by the time officers arrive, the incident is usually over. He complained 
that police tend to make arrests on minor misdemeanor charges, such as 
loitering and trespassing, instead of going after serious criminals. He added 
that residents do not cooperate with police because they don't trust them. 
</P>
<P>
"We bring a lot of trouble upon ourselves, but police put a lot of chaos out, 
too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Program organizers are aware of the communications problems, Deputy Chief 
William Rathburn said. He added that with the new outpost, police are trying to 
"buy into the community." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve LAPD and Housing Authority officers will use the outpost to take 
reports, make phone calls, conduct community watch programs and youth athletic 
leagues, and take an occasional break from walking the housing project beat. 
</P>
<P>
The program is the second phase of Operation Hammer, a police crackdown in 
areas of the city where gang activity is highest. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to build a relationship with tenants here so they can 
participate in the process of protecting themselves," Rathburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of crime, the Police Department's biggest problem is residents' fear of 
grappling with the troubling gang presence. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found an enormous amount of apathy in the community," Rathburn said. 
"They don't want to see the crime that is happening. Even the good people tend 
to be isolated. We can't help them unless they come out of their houses." 
</P>
<P>
Rathburn said the residents who complained of not having a voice in structuring 
the program failed to attend City Council meetings at which the program was 
devised. 
</P>
<P>
He said that in a neighborhood survey, 90% of residents told police they 
supported the stepped-up patrols. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not so sure it's going to go smoothly," Rathburn said. "I'm not overly 
optimistic. But we are trying to focus on the positive. 
</P>
<P>
"This office is a symbol that we are residents here, and we are not going to be 
driven out." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Frierson, 60, a 34-year resident of Imperial Courts, said police officers 
several months ago went door to door conducting a survey and seemed to be doing 
the best they could to build better rapport with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"Just their presence will make a vast difference," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She was not sure how hard-core gang members would respond to the 24-hour police 
watch with the opening of the outpost, but she thought that if the police 
sponsor sports leagues and educational programs, it will give children an 
alternative to gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of little gang members could leave what they are doing if they had a 
choice," she said.

Anaheim police arrested more than 100 small-time cocaine and marijuana dealers 
in three low-income neighborhoods near Disneyland after a three-month 
undercover investigation triggered by complaints from residents. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy on Thursday described the sweep that netted 105 
suspected drug dealers in six days as a "show of force" in the Lynne-Jeffrey, 
Ponderosa Park and Citron-Vermont neighborhoods, where drug sales had been on 
the increase. 
</P>
<P>
The three areas are in the southern portion of the city near Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Small quantities of cocaine, heroin and marijuana with a total street value of 
about $50,000, as well as rifles and money, were seized during the arrests, 
Molloy said. 
</P>
<P>
The police searched 10 residences where officers had purchased drugs during the 
investigation. Owners were informed that if drug activity continued on their 
premises, the properties could be seized, Molloy said. 
</P>
<P>
Police also charged the managers of five motels with maintaining a disorderly 
house and have issued warrants for their arrest. Molloy said the motels were 
"catering" to prostitutes in the drug areas. The motels are: the Crown Motel at 
1136 N. Anaheim Blvd., the Americana Motel at 130 S. Beach Blvd., the Top's 
Motel at 909 S. Harbor Blvd., Stage Stop Motel at 2912 W. Lincoln Ave., and the 
Palm Motor Lodge at 1101 N. Harbor Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The drug investigation began after neighbors protested that the dealers were 
becoming increasingly brazen in their street sales and in dealing from several 
houses, Molloy said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrol officers assigned to the area also noticed that the dealers were able to 
easily conceal their goods and signal each other when police cars were in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
In May, about 25 police officers went under cover and made more than 125 
purchases of heroin and cocaine, only two of which were crack-cocaine sales, 
said Capt. John Flanagan, who headed the operation, which was called Narcomania 
I. With the purchases in hand, police were able to obtain 75 arrest warrants 
that led to the capture of the 105 suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Of those arrested, there were 95 men, three women, and seven teen-agers ranging 
in age from 15 to 18. The adults were being held at Orange County Jail in Santa 
Ana, where they were booked on suspicion of selling narcotics. The youths were 
taken to Juvenile Hall in Orange. Sixty-three arrests were made in the 
Ponderosa area, 32 in Lynne-Jeffrey and 10 in Citron-Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think it's like closing a retail outlet store. There's no market 
anymore, at least not for a while. There's no one to buy from," Flanagan said. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said there was no guarantee that drug sales were over in the three 
neighborhoods, but he said he hoped that the sweep creates "paranoia" for 
dealers in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, they don't know when they are dealing with the man," Flanagan 
said.

TENNIS PLAYER DIES IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the tennis court, David Young never believed he could lose -- even against a 
superior player. And when he did lose, he always flashed an incredulous grin. 
His friends say he saw himself as invincible, immortal. 
</P>
<P>
Although his ranking -- 999th in the world -- was so low that few beyond family 
and friends would notice, his coaches say he showed great promise. 
</P>
<P>
That promise was snuffed out in a burst of gunfire early Wednesday as Young, 
21, and a friend rode a motorcycle through an upscale Pasadena neighborhood not 
far from his San Marino home. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who had returned two weeks earlier from a monthlong stint playing in 
West Germany, died about 1 a.m. on Arroyo Boulevard near the Rose Bowl after 
suffering two gunshot wounds. His passenger, Alan Harlan, 21, a friend who had 
been living at the Young family's home, was shot four times and remained in 
serious condition Thursday night at Huntington Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena police are investigating the incident as a drive-by shooting -- the 
city's 70th so far this year -- but said there was no reason to believe that 
the attack was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Monte Yancey said officers also are investigating whether drugs were 
involved in the shooting but added that there was no evidence of that. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, near a dried puddle of blood off Arroyo Boulevard, friends had 
built a makeshift shrine for Young -- leaving flowers, a small American flag 
and a green tennis ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think Dave thought he was invincible, that nobody could hurt him," 
said David Kaplan, 21, a friend from high school. 
</P>
<P>
At San Marino High, Young was known for his free-spirited antics, such as 
excusing himself from class, hopping fully clothed into a nearby swimming pool 
and returning to his seat dripping wet. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it my way," was the caption he chose for his yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
"He would just say, 'I'm from San Marino, I don't give a (damn),' " said 
another friend, Alan Oberlander, 21. "You have to live here to understand. All 
the people are nice, they all have nice homes and they don't have to struggle. 
There was nothing for him to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
Young's parents, Jack, a certified public accountant, and Gayle, a real estate 
agent, said they spoke with Harlan, who told them that a white Mustang 
convertible had begun trailing the motorcycle as he and Young rode toward a 
grocery store. The car pulled up alongside of them, Harlan said, and with no 
words someone opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no hostility of any kind," said Jack Young, who moved with his wife 
and four children from Altadena to an elegant, palm-lined street in San Marino 
10 years ago. "I don't think they had any idea they were going to be shot." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said David Young "was the life of the party. You could tell when he was 
going to do something exciting because he would click his fingers and rub his 
hands together like, 'Oh, yeah, oh, boy.' " 
</P>
<P>
On the tennis court, however, Young was somewhat more serious, winning varsity 
letters in high school. Last year he earned the top seed at Grossmont College 
in San Diego, where he was a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
In June, he went to Europe at the invitation of a West German tennis club near 
Stuttgart, where he won all six of his matches. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very good player, although he wasn't the best," said Brian Chambers, 
his high school tennis coach. "But I think he felt he was immortal. That's why 
this all comes as such a shock."

PRIEST'S TESTIMONY RESULTS IN UPROAR AT KRAFT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
A shouting match erupted at the Randy Steven Kraft murder trial Thursday among 
the lawyers and the judge when an Episcopal priest tried to lecture the jurors 
about the evils of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin admonished Kraft attorney C. Thomas 
McDonald that the details of an execution itself and an argument on capital 
punishment are not proper for jurors to consider. 
</P>
<P>
In the courtroom without jurors present, McDonald told the judge that the 
priest's remarks were only preliminary to his testimony about why Kraft should 
not be executed. 
</P>
<P>
The judge shot back: "If it's preliminary, that means it's OK? That's stupid. . 
. . It's hogwash." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hogwash my foot," McDonald shouted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm telling you it's hogwash and you know it's hogwash," the judge yelled 
back. "You're bright enough to know what can come in and what can't. . . . 
Clearly the views of the Episcopal Church should not be before the jury." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 44, was convicted by the jury two months ago in Santa Ana of the murders 
of 16 young men in Orange County. At his death penalty hearing, prosecutors 
have accused him of eight more murders -- six in Oregon and two in Michigan. 
The jury must decide between a verdict of death or life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Joe Morris Doss of St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Palo Alto 
interviewed Kraft and his family members about a month ago. Doss told jurors 
that Kraft should not be executed, primarily because "even if he has committed 
these atrocious crimes, we ought to give him a chance to grow spiritually . . . 
and to give him a chance to redeem himself." 
</P>
<P>
Doss got into trouble with Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown and the judge when 
he began to talk about the death penalty itself. After the judge cut him off, 
Doss asked: "Your honor, may I just add one thing?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, sir, you may not," McCartin answered. The judge later cautioned the priest 
not to volunteer information beyond the question asked, "and then you and I 
won't have any trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Doss managed to say that he believes Kraft should be spared because an 
execution would be so hard on his family. But during the non-jury hearing, the 
judge said that is not a proper issue for jurors to hear. 
</P>
<P>
That caused McDonald to erupt again. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no objection (from Brown) at the time. This is the court now 
volunteering to assist the prosecution," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was Brown who said "hogwash." 
</P>
<P>
After his return to the stand, Doss -- who heard this debate -- asked Brown to 
keep an eye on him to make sure he didn't say the wrong thing again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure I have enough eyes," Brown said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
Doss said he believes that Kraft cares about others and could serve in prison 
as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, claim that Kraft may be the most prolific serial killer 
in the country. Although they have limited the trial to a total of 24 murders, 
they claim in court papers that Kraft has killed 45 young men over an 11-year 
period. Most were between 18 and 25 years old and were either sexually abused 
or mutilated. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Kraft, a computer consultant from Long Beach, 
committed the murders in Oregon and Michigan when he was there on business. 
</P>
<P>
One of the defense witnesses Thursday was Jean Geddes, who worked with Kraft in 
Oregon and thought highly of him. In fact, she said, she was attracted to him, 
unaware that he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
"You've always heard about California girls. Well, the Oregon girls like to see 
a California boy once in a while," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Geddes said that when she learned in 1983 that Randy Kraft was arrested as a 
suspect in murders in California and Oregon, her first thought was: " 'Randy's 
sure going to have a tough time. He's got the same name as that guy picked up 
in California.' I did not associate my Randy with the name in the news." 
</P>
<P>
The penalty phase of Kraft's trial will resume Monday morning.

ASSEMBLY PASSES BILL TO OUTLAW UNIFORMED GUARDS AT POLLING PLACES

The Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a Senate bill that would make it a 
felony to post uniformed security guards near voting booths. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, sponsored by state Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco), was 
written as a direct response to allegations that the Orange County Republican 
Party hired uniformed guards to stand outside of 20 predominantly Latino 
precincts in Santa Ana to intimidate voters in the 72nd Assembly District 
election narrowly won by Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
"This is not Panama," Marks said Thursday. "Elections in America shouldn't be 
decided by the number of political thugs each side can muster to the polls." 
</P>
<P>
The bill now goes back to the Senate, which must concur with some minor 
amendments, before it is sent to Gov. George Deukmejian to be signed into law.

FINLEY HAS ENOUGH TO TURN BACK TIGERS IN 9-INNING STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here it was the top of the ninth inning, the score tied and Chuck Finley had 
worked himself into another fine mess. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed to be a familiar theme in the Angels' game against the Detroit Tigers 
Thursday at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Finley struck out the first two Tigers he faced, gave up a 
single to Rick Schu, then a triple to Mike Heath that tied the score at 3. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, Finley again got the first two batters before finding himself in 
trouble. But Alan Trammell's double was the only hit the Tigers could manage. 
Finley wriggled out of the inning by striking out Tracy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the ninth and Finley faced Chet Lemon, who already had a two-run 
homer and a single off Finley. He came into the game five for six with a home 
run against Finley this season. 
</P>
<P>
But Finley got him to hit a weak grounder to the mound for the first out. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Gary Ward, who promptly hit a ground-rule double. Instant trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Schu, who had a double in addition to his seventh-inning single, stung Finley 
again. But third baseman Jack Howell caught Schu's line drive for the second 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"That backhand play by Jack Howell was the key out," Finley said later. 
</P>
<P>
Before Heath, the next hitter, settled into the batter's box, the Angels held a 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching coach Marcel Lachemann gave Finley an option: pitch to Heath or walk 
him intentionally and take his chances with former Angel Gary Pettis, the 
Tigers' light-hitting center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
"My druthers was to walk Heath," Angel Manager Doug Rader said after the game. 
"(But) generally pitchers know what they feel most comfortable with." 
</P>
<P>
And so Finley opted to pitch to Heath, albeit carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him some good pitches and he wouldn't fish for them," said Finley, who 
wound up walking Heath anyway. "It came down to me and Pettis." 
</P>
<P>
And Finley won the confrontation, striking out Pettis for the fourth time in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The last inning took a lot out of me," Finley said. "I had to make a lot of 
tough pitches." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels went on to win, 4-3, on Wally Joyner's RBI single in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Finley turned in a steady, if trouble-filled, performance to improve his record 
to 11-6. It was his fourth complete game in his past five starts and ninth this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
He struck out 12, but gave up 10 hits. He walked one, but had runners on base 
in all but two innings. 
</P>
<P>
He got the ball up at times -- especially in the second when Lemon homered, 
Ward flied deep to left and Schu doubled off the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have very good stuff," Finley said of the first few innings. "I just 
tried to tell myself to get the ball down." 
</P>
<P>
Finley said he felt comfortable in the middle innings, but the baserunners kept 
coming in a seemingly endless line. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he struck out the side in the seventh, but allowed the tying run 
that same inning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those games where you know you can't make mistakes with guys on 
base," Finley said. "I kept fighting, kept battling and good things happened." 
</P>
<P>
And in the end, the good outweighed the bad by the barest margin.

TRAINING CAMP ROSTER PROVES YOU CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY LINEBACKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's an old saying in football that you can never have enough linebackers. 
Or is that an old baseball saying about pitchers? 
</P>
<P>
Whichever, the Rams have enough linebackers to start a dance troupe. They 
opened training camp with 17 on the roster, about a dozen more than you might 
use on a given day. 
</P>
<P>
If they needed anything on draft day it was inside help, what with the loss of 
veterans Carl Ekern (retirement), Jim Collins (free agency) and possibly Mark 
Jerue (knee surgery). 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams passed on inside linebacker Keith DeLong in the first round and 
drafted two more outside rushers in the second, Notre Dame's Frank Stams and 
Brian Smith of Auburn. Sticking to their theme, they took another outside 
linebacker, George Bethune, in the seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
It all sounds a bit crazy, though Rams claim to know what they're doing. Last 
year they unveiled the Eagle defense, a five-linebacker scheme that featured 
only two down linemen. They gave up bulk for quickness and rushed the opposing 
quarterback in waves, leading the league with 56 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Smith and Stams, when he eventually signs, will give the 
defense even more versatility. The plan is to attack an opponent with even more 
multiple shifts of youthful faces. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson says the team might keep 10 linebackers on the 47-man 
roster, which should provide a pretty good fight for playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about that now," Robinson said. "I'm worried about getting the 
best guys playing." 
</P>
<P>
Here's an early handicap in order of job security: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kevin Greene. The Eagle defense made him a star last season. He finished 
with 16 1/2 sacks, second in the National Football League only to Reggie White. 
Here's the difference: White is demanding in excess of $7 million to play in 
Philadelphia the next five seasons. Greene will earn $250,000 this year, 
subject to renegotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mel Owens. The nine-year veteran was off to his best start last year before 
suffering an ankle sprain that forced him out of the last nine games. Owens has 
been asked to play some inside linebacker this year because of the lack of 
depth at the position. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't switched positions, it's just additional responsibilities," Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Wilcher. The Rams would love a return to form of 1985, when he had 12 
1/2 sacks. He fell to 7 1/2 sacks last season, but remains a load of talent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Larry Kelm. He takes over for Carl Ekern at inside linebacker and calls the 
signals on defense. He's been groomed three years for this job. It's time to 
throw away the comb. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fred Strickland. The second-year man from Purdue takes over the other 
inside spot for Jim Collins/Mark Jerue. Robinson thinks Strickland soon could 
be one of the great players in the league. Strickland capped his rookie season 
with 13 tackles and four quarterback sacks in his final two games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frank Stams/Brian Smith. These rookies are safe because teams don't cut 
second-round draft choices. Smith is 6-foot-6 and already swatting down passes 
in practice. Stams remains a holdout. When he arrives, he'll be amazed at the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brett Faryniarz. He made the team as a free agent last season, but the line 
at outside linebacker forms at the rear. He'll need another great training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mark Jerue. With two good knees, Jerue would be near the top of the list. 
But he's fighting off another arthroscopic surgery and is trying to make one 
last charge in August. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Byron Darby. He signed as an unprotected free agent in the off-season after 
spending the past two years with Indianapolis. He's a versatile veteran who can 
also play nose tackle. That helps his chances. The sprained ankle that will 
keep him out a week or so does not. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Davis. He also signed as an unprotected free agent and can play Mel 
Owens' spot over the tight end in the Eagle defense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- George Bethune. The seventh-round choice from Alabama is impressing coaches 
in camp. His problem? He's an outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mark Messner. An interesting project who's being looked at in Jerue's 
roving linebacker/nose tackle position. Messner lacks the size of a down 
lineman and speed for a linebacker, but finished with 71 tackles at Michigan 
last season. He doesn't do anything real well except play football. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
With veterans due Monday and still a lot of paper work to be done, the Rams 
have scheduled a 3 p.m. meeting today with Steve Feldman, who represents four 
of the team's eight unsigned veterans. The name of the group is tailback Greg 
Bell, but it also includes offensive linemen Duval Love, Tony Slaton and Robert 
Cox. Feldman was making no predictions on Thursday. "Jay (Zygmunt, general 
counsel) called me, so that's a good sign," he said. . . . Left tackle Irv 
Pankey apparently is headed for another long holdout and his agent says he 
won't make the upcoming trip to Tokyo. In 1986, Pankey missed the Rams' trip to 
London because of a holdout.

PLAN SOUGHT TO KEEP 'VIRUSES' FROM A COMPUTER NETWORK

<P>
A massive electronic network linking more than 60,000 computers remains 
vulnerable to potentially crippling attack by computer "viruses," the General 
Accounting Office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the White House science adviser 
should oversee efforts to help protect the network, Internet, from sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
In a report, the agency said lax security procedures on Internet contributed to 
the severity of problems that resulted when a software virus "infected" the 
system last November, crippling thousands of computers. 
</P>
<P>
Internet, the main computer network used by the U.S. research community, is 
composed of more than 500 national, regional and local networks nationwide and 
overseas handling unclassified information. Two of the largest component 
networks are sponsored by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency and the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report was released at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. 
</P>
<P>
Jack L. Brock Jr., director of the GAO's government information and financial 
management division, told the panel that since the virus attack last fall, 
security has been strengthened on many computers connected to Internet. 
</P>
<P>
However, "we still feel that the lack of central control (over security) . . . 
remains a problem," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the subcommittee, asked Brock 
whether Internet was still vulnerable to computer viruses and other types of 
software sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO official responded: "Sure. . . . No open system can ever be completely 
secure." 
</P>
<P>
Computer viruses are generally small strings of computer codes that can 
infiltrate software programs and replicate themselves thousands of times, 
causing computer systems to "crash." In some cases, they can surreptitiously 
alter or destroy computer data. 
</P>
<P>
Also testifying at the hearing was John Landry, appearing on behalf of ADAPSO, 
the Computer Software and Services Industry Assn.

AMERICAN INTERSTATE OF COSTA MESA SEIZED BY U.S., ALONG WITH A SECOND S&amp;L 
IN L.A.

<P>
Two small Southern California savings and loans, including one with its 
administrative office in Orange County, were taken over Thursday by federal 
authorities, officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
The two insolvent institutions are American Interstate Savings, which has its 
corporate headquarters in Costa Mesa and operates a single office on South 
Figueroa Street in Los Angeles, and Sierra Federal Savings, a one-office 
savings and loan on North Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
American Interstate, which had few retail customers and appeared to concentrate 
on mortgage lending for multiple-family dwellings, has $27 million in assets. 
Sierra Federal has $49 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The thrifts are among seven institutions in California, Florida, Illinois, 
Louisiana, New Mexico and Tennessee placed in conservatorship Thursday as part 
of a joint regulatory program by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., 
the federal agency that insures deposits at member thrifts, and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp., which backs funds on deposits in member commercial 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
The moves were taken in preparation for expected congressional passage of an 
expensive bailout of savings and loans. By putting the institutions into 
conservatorship, the government is seeking to minimize losses and limit risk 
until Congress provides money to close them or subsidize their sale. 
</P>
<P>
American Interstate -- which moved its administrative office to Costa Mesa from 
Los Angeles last year -- was the third S&amp;L with headquarters in Orange 
County to be taken over by regulators this year and the 14th county-based 
thrift to be seized since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The institutions seized Thursday were transformed into new mutual associations, 
effectively wiping out any subordinated debt and stockholder positions. 
American Interstate was privately owned, with just seven shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
For unexplained reasons, Sierra Federal's name will be changed to Clover 
Federal Savings &amp; Loan. American Interstate Savings will retain its name. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Williams, a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said 
depositors are not affected by the takeovers. He said neither of the two 
California institutions has a very active retail business but instead cater to 
money brokers, who place large amounts of money in institutions that offer high 
"jumbo" rates. 
</P>
<P>
According to its March 31 financial statement, filed with the Federal Home Loan 
Bank in San Francisco, American Interstate lost $529,000 for the first three 
months of the year, following a $1.1-million loss for 1988. The S&amp;L's 
single branch in Los Angeles had only $26 million in deposits in 364 accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said a federal regulator has been named managing agent for American 
Interstate. In addition, Val Mellgrin, who was named president and chief 
executive of American Interstate in March, will remain in that position, and 
none of the S&amp;L's 18 other employees will be fired, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Just three of the employees work in the branch office in Los Angeles, he said.

SEARCH IS ON FOR PROFIT FROM LIKELY POWER SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Talk of looming power shortages and brownouts around the country has many 
people worrying about the problems those circumstances might cause. 
</P>
<P>
But some financial analysts and stock-market investors are also looking into 
who might stand to benefit, acting on the time-honored Wall Street precept that 
every crisis contains an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The electric power situation hasn't yet reached crisis proportions. But as the 
Merrill Lynch Market Letter observes in a special report on the subject: 
</P>
<P>
"Supplies of electricity are gradually tightening in many regions, especially 
in New England, on New York's Long Island and in some mid-Atlantic states. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem reflects unexpectedly strong demand in recent years, operating 
difficulties that have forced some generating stations out of service, and the 
reluctance of some local governments to allow completed plants to operate." 
</P>
<P>
A team of analysts at IDS Financial Services, the big Minneapolis-based 
money-management firm, asserts, "The United States faces the very real threat 
of a substantial shortage of electricity, on a national scale, by the 
mid-1990s." 
</P>
<P>
In most industries, an investor's response to such a forecast would be simple 
-- buy stocks of companies that own and produce the commodity or product in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regulators Control Rates 
</P>
<P>
But electric utilities are a special case, since they lack the ability to set 
their prices simply on the basis of supply-and-demand market forces. The rates 
they can charge are set by state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unlikely that many utilities will benefit substantially from higher sales 
of electricity. Regulatory authorities often make it difficult for companies to 
keep extra profits," says Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
Any gain in revenues and profits, IDS says, is likely to occur at a utility 
that has a large "reserve margin" -- capacity to provide extra power at periods 
of peak demand. Utilities with tight reserve margins would be in a losing, 
rather than winning, position. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the story could be different, however, for other businesses that 
serve the electric utility industry in a variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution to the problem of insufficient power-generating capacity clearly 
is to build new power plants and transmission facilities," Merrill Lynch says. 
</P>
<P>
"Many utilities have begun to do just that. Some utilities are turning 
increasingly to comparatively small, gas-fired generating stations that can be 
put into service relatively quickly." 
</P>
<P>
By IDS's reckoning, "if only half of the new power-plant capacity is gas fired, 
electric utility demand for natural gas will be 60% higher than it was in 
1988." 
</P>
<P>
Overall capital spending by the electric power industry, in decline since the 
early 1980s, is predicted to begin increasing in the years just ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"That suggests that companies in a number of fields -- including engineering 
and construction, machinery and electrical equipment -- stand to benefit in the 
not-too-distant future," Merrill Lynch says. 
</P>
<P>
"Further out, suppliers of fuel such as natural gas and low-sulfur coal could 
benefit once new or expanded power plants are in operation." 
</P>
<P>
A special hazard in the search for companies that will prosper serving the 
power industry arises from the complicated environmental, scientific and 
political questions involved. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, even assuming a recession or two and no dramatic increase in 
demand for energy, IDS analysts reckon that "twice as much additional 
power-plant capacity will be needed by the year 2000 as the electric industry 
currently estimates."

POPULARITY OF PRE-PLANNED FUNERALS ON THE RISE; 
</P>
<P>
ARRANGEMENTS THAT OFFER FLEXIBILITY, INFLATION PROTECTION ARE RECOMMENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rather than leaving the decisions and expenses to their survivors, increasing 
numbers of Americans are arranging for their funerals in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral directors, insurance companies and other organizations have responded 
with a broad array of programs and services to meet the increased demand. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, says the American Assn. of Retired Persons, sales of "pre-need" 
funeral contracts surpassed 800,000 in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The basic idea of planning funeral arrangements ahead of time makes a lot of 
sense, the association says in a published report. That way, you can make 
choices in an orderly way that might otherwise have to be dealt with by others 
in haste amid trying emotional circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
But the AARP urges that you proceed with care before you start writing checks 
for a specific package. 
</P>
<P>
"Should you pre-plan your funeral? Definitely," the association says. "AARP 
recommends everyone pre-plan, but cautions consumers about prepaying their 
funerals. There are risks." 
</P>
<P>
First of all, it notes, ill-advised commitments can be costly, with the average 
cost of a traditional funeral approaching $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
That outlay covers such items and services as a casket, memorial services and 
the use of a funeral home. It typically does not include other basics such as a 
burial site, limousines and flowers, which altogether can double the total cost 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
Of course any funeral arrangement should first suit your religious and 
emotional preferences. However, says the AARP, a prepaid arrangement should 
also make sense practically and financially. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it says, you may well want to look for a plan that offers 
flexibility should you change your mind in the future about where you want the 
funeral to be held. 
</P>
<P>
"Most, but not all, pre-need plans offer some portability or the ability to 
move with you," the association points out. 
</P>
<P>
The longer you expect to live after you sign a contract, it observes, the more 
inflation protection you probably will want. 
</P>
<P>
This protection can take the form of a guarantee from a funeral director that 
the services will be provided at no further charge, no matter what the going 
rate is at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Or the money you put up can be invested for you, through a trust setup or 
insurance policy that allows it to grow over time. "There are some pre-need 
plans which earn no interest," the AARP says. "Don't waste your money on 
these." 
</P>
<P>
Even supposing that your plan keeps you ahead of future increases in funeral 
costs, there is another question to be considered in advance. 
</P>
<P>
In cases where more funds build up than are needed to cover funeral costs, some 
plans turn the excess over to your survivors, while others provide for the 
funeral director to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the financial arrangements, the AARP says, it's important to 
shop carefully for the funeral services themselves, which can vary widely in 
price and details from one establishment to another. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Trade Commission rules require funeral directors to provide itemized 
price lists that can be used in comparison-shopping. 
</P>
<P>
You can also check with government authorities and consumer agencies to help 
determine the reputation and reliability of a given funeral director. 
</P>
<P>
"Visit a minimum of two funeral homes," the AARP advises. "It's important to 
shop around for the best prices on the merchandise and services you select. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't allow anyone to push you into purchasing merchandise you don't want or 
can't afford."

MARVELING AT THE SUCCESS OF THE STAN LEE STYLE

In a way, Marvel Comics publisher Stan Lee sees the runaway box-office success 
of the motion picture "Batman" and the "Superman" film series before that as 
triumphs of the Marvel style. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that the two super-heroes-turned-movie-stars are from the stable 
of Marvel's archrival, DC Comics. 
</P>
<P>
Lee is often credited with bringing a human dimension to the world of 
super-hero comics when as a writer in the '60s he created such characters as 
Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk and the Fantastic Four. The publisher of Marvel 
Comics since 1972 and a revered figure among comic-book buffs, Lee will speak 
and sign autographs at a collectibles show in Buena Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It is the human dimension that helped make hits out of the "Superman" series 
and now "Batman," Lee believes. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never any human side to Superman (in the comic books), and precious 
little humor," Lee, 66, said in an interview from his Los Angeles home. "They 
did the motion picture in the Marvel style." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Batman's darker, human side as emphasized in the movie did not 
really become part of the character's makeup until Frank Miller's 1986 graphic 
novel, "The Dark Knight Returns," which Lee believes was inspired more by the 
Marvel tradition than by DC's Batman predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
Four weeks after its opening, "Batman" has taken $167.6 million at the box 
office. Lee is not envious about the success of "Batman" -- in fact, he says he 
is delighted. He hopes that the hit film will help pave the way to success for 
several film treatments of Marvel characters that are in various stages of 
production. "Batman," he said, has taught Hollywood a lesson: "The public loves 
comic-book type characters and stories, if they're well done." 
</P>
<P>
Marvel has licensed its super-hero characters to TV and film productions in the 
past, with varying degrees of success. "The Incredible Hulk" had a successful 
television run, for instance, while a live-action TV version of Spider-Man's 
adventures bombed. Often, Lee said, producers opt to tone down the characters' 
comic-book qualities, to their own downfall. 
</P>
<P>
The Spider-Man series "was bland, and that's the most dangerous thing a movie 
or television series can be," Lee said. "And it's one thing our comic books are 
not." 
</P>
<P>
In a just-finished film based on a Marvel character, "The Punisher," the 
producers decided -- against Lee's advice -- to eliminate a skull design from 
the costume. Lee, who served as a consultant on the film, believes that the 
distinctive design could have helped in marketing the movie, much as "Batman" 
helped fuel the hype machine with its ubiquitous bat logo. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the 'Batman' movie will help in that sense," Lee said. "There's no 
need to get away from that comic-book look." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, moving to protect his conception of the Marvel characters, is taking a 
more active role in future film projects. He is executive producer of a number 
of coming live-action films, involving such characters as Captain America, 
Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Ant Man and Nick Fury, Agent of Shield. 
</P>
<P>
"Captain America," after a number of false starts, has finally finished 
principal photography in Yugoslavia and is now completing filming on the West 
Coast. While Lee is happy with what he has seen, he admitted that the film does 
not have a "Batman"-size budget, nor does the cast -- Matt Salinger, Ned 
Beatty, Darren McGavin and Ronnie Cox -- have quite the box-office punch of 
"Batman" stars Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton and Kim Basinger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an expensive cast -- we don't have Dustin Hoffman or anything -- but 
it's a very good cast," Lee said. "It won't be 'Batman' because it's not that 
big a movie. . . . It's kind of tough to compete with a movie that cost 
anywhere from $40 million to $60 million." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, who came up through the Marvel ranks as a writer, now keeps his hand in 
all aspects of the Marvel empire. He continues to write the daily syndicated 
comic-strip version of Spider-Man ("If I gave that up, I couldn't really call 
myself a writer anymore," he said) and has written several books. He also heads 
Marvel Productions, which produces Saturday morning animated shows for young 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
A cult figure among comics buffs, he is also a regular at comics conventions. 
And although he plans to cut back on his appearances, he doesn't plan to give 
it up entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in the audience may feel they learn something from me, at least I 
hope they do, but I learn so much more from them," he said. "It gives you a 
chance to be out there and actually talk to the people you're trying to reach." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee said, the popularity of comic books continues to climb, 
especially among adult readers. The advent of graphic novels, with more 
sophisticated story lines, has helped. "We've always had the younger readers, 
and we always will. Each day, we seem to get more older readers," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been saying this for years: People love fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Lee, publisher of Marvel Comics, will speak and sign autographs at a 
Collectibles Super Show from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Buena Park Hotel, 7675 
Crescent Ave., Buena Park. Admission: $4. Information: (714) 985-3845.

Permits for multifamily housing issued during the first four months of 1989 
dropped dramatically compared to the same period one year ago. During the 
January-April period this year, 2,495 permits were issued, a 39% decline from 
1988. The 1989 four-month total is, in fact, the worst recorded during the last 
four years -- down 59% from 1987 and 47% from 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the year-to-date totals, multifamily permits have been trending upward 
on a month-to-month basis this year, with April's 876 the highest monthly 
total. That is well below the 2,354 issued last April and the 2,298 of April 
1987, but more than 1986's 546. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at where the year-to-date changes have occurred in the county:

STYLE: MEN SHIFT TO CUSTOM CLOTHIERS

Roger Torriero glanced at his watch and cut off the business call he had taken 
in his ninth-floor office at Griffin Towers in Santa Ana. It was time to pick 
out a pair of pants. 
</P>
<P>
Unfurled on his desk were scores of nubby swatches in European wool and French 
silk. Forty minutes later, Torriero, a principal of Griffin/Related Properties, 
had ordered three suits and five shirts from David Rickey &amp; Co. of Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
While retailers bemoan sluggish sales in women's clothing, menswear sales are 
jumping. Over the past two years, sales in nearly every category of menswear 
have increased by 5 to 12% nationwide, according to Ron Arden, menswear 
director for the California Mart in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A growing segment of this menswear market is custom-made clothing. According to 
the Custom Tailors and Designers Assn. of America, sales of made-to-measure 
clothing have increased about 10% nationwide over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although several businesses in the area have offered custom-made suits and 
shirts for years -- including Gentlemen's Choice in Irvine and Newport Custom 
Tailors in Costa Mesa -- few men's boutiques have offered a wide range of 
custom clothes as well as off-the-rack accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Then last August a swanky custom store opened in South Coast Plaza. Alfred 
Dunhill, a satellite shop for the 82-year-old London clothier firm, sells 
custom-tailored suits, shirts and shoes from its 900-square-foot shop with 
cherry-wood fixtures and brass-lined shelves. Dunhill offers custom wear and 
off-the-rack apparel, including cashmere sport coats, wool coats and leather 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
David Rickey &amp; Co., which also opened last August, has emerged as one of 
Southern California's largest custom clothiers. The 2,700-square-foot salon in 
Costa Mesa features custom-made casual clothes, business suits, shirts, pants 
and evening wear in addition to a wide range of pricey accessories: $950 shoes, 
$800 sweaters and ties ranging from $42.50 to $120. 
</P>
<P>
David Rickey is owned by three young partners -- David Schwartz, David Heil and 
Rickey Lamitie -- who describe the upscale, prestige look of Orange County 
businessmen as stylish but not too high-fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the high-fashion look toned down a bit," Schwartz, 28, says. "We bring 
the style down a little so it's not too New York or L.A. Orange County has its 
own look." 
</P>
<P>
In its first year of operation -- the partners began visiting clients shortly 
before the Costa Mesa store was opened -- David Rickey has racked up $2.1 
million in sales and 1,000 customers, according to Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
"We are an example of Orange County's coming of age," he says. "It used to be 
if someone successful wanted a wardrobe of clothes on the cutting edge of 
fashion he was leaving the county to get it, going to New York or L.A. or 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Now he is able to get the finest here (in Orange County)," Schwartz says. 
"Also, five years ago there were not the business and social clubs there are 
now, and with these social clubs come social obligations, which require 
wardrobes. People are starting to see that we do not all wear overalls and pick 
oranges." 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Lamitie says men are taking tips from their wives. 
</P>
<P>
"A majority of our clients have large expendable incomes and wives who have 
spent quite a bit on their wardrobes for years," Lamitie, 31, says. "Gradually 
men are doing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Among David Rickey's customers are Thomas Tucker, president of Pennhill Co., 
the Newport Beach developer; Carl Karcher, chairman of the board of Carl's Jr. 
Restaurants; basketball player Magic Johnson; Brandy Birtcher, a partner in the 
Birtcher development firm; Don Christy Jr., president of NADA Appraisal Guides 
in Costa Mesa; Tony Moiso, president of the Santa Margarita Co., and Randy De 
Lano, senior vice president of Mission Viejo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
De Lano says "everyone has noticed" his new look since he began ordering from 
David Rickey. "It makes my life a lot simpler too. I'm hoping soon they'll just 
make everything except my shoes and underwear." 
</P>
<P>
Before discovering David Rickey, Don Christy says he slogged through the 
shopping centers. "I was having a lot of things made but was also shopping the 
department stores," he says. "But once you start buying custom, it's hard to go 
back. What they make fits so much better, and you have things you don't see on 
anybody else. That's the part I like the best." 
</P>
<P>
Customers say one of the biggest draws in going custom is the time saved by not 
having to shop. 
</P>
<P>
"The saving of time is very, very important," Torriero says. "And the quality 
of services, which include them coming to your office and working with 
predetermined measurements, is essential when you're busy." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz says his clients want total wardrobes created with the minimum amount 
of fuss -- no lengthy consultations or fittings. Most of the transactions are 
conducted in the clients' homes or offices, although the store has a roomy 
shopping area and private fitting rooms for those who come in. 
</P>
<P>
Consultations and initial fittings take about two hours (usually spread over 
two or three visits), and within four to eight weeks the garments are ready. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started we concentrated on shirts and suits, but in time we realized 
our clients wanted us to handle everything," Schwartz says. "Now we do it all, 
from golf clothes to casual wear to evening wear." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the clothes are sewn on the East Coast in European, mostly 
English, fabrics. Schwartz says customers can choose from more than 4,500 
different fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Prices range from $400 to $3,000 for suits, $85 to $200 for shirts and $500 to 
$3,000 for evening wear. The lower-priced clothing is generally machine sewn; 
the higher prices are for bench-made (100% hand-sewn garments). 
</P>
<P>
But the partners say that for many of their customers, money is no object. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the business takes place in the upper range," Lamitie says. 
"The aim was offering the best because to many of our clients the cost was 
unimportant. They would come in and ask for the best they could get. . . . I 
have one customer who spent $108,000 on clothes just in the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happening is a lot of men are starting to realize there aren't that 
many things other than cars that they can spoil themselves with," he adds. "But 
they can spoil themselves with clothes."

ANN CONWAY: 'GYPSY' CARAVAN WINDS UP AT BISTRO FOR POST-SHOW BASH

Arrive fashionably late. Bolt from a limo. Deadpan "for ready money only" when 
the paparazzi invites you to stop and smile. Sweep through the bistro door. 
Grab a Kir cocktail. Plop in a booth, sigh and pronounce: "What's good about 
the living theater is if you don't get it exactly right, they give you the 
chance to try again next time." 
</P>
<P>
Tyne Daly is in town, and the doe-eyed star of "Gypsy," which is headed for 
Broadway, was reluctant to wax ecstatic about her opening night Tuesday at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to feel the room (Segerstrom Hall)," she said at Birraporetti's, 
site of the post-performance bash. "But it was my first time. I'll know better 
tomorrow. I did take a tour of the theater today and saw there wasn't a bad 
seat in the house." 
</P>
<P>
As Daly ("Mama Rose" in the show) chatted with good friend Stephanie Zimbalist, 
party guests rhapsodized about her performance. 
</P>
<P>
"She had such intensity on stage," said Thomas Kendrick, president of the 
Center board. "She controlled the stage, built her character with the same 
intensity she builds Mary Beth Lacey on 'Cagney and Lacey.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I loved Tyne," said Jeanette Lane Bradbury, who played Dainty June to Ethel 
Merman's Mama Rose when "Gypsy" opened on Broadway in 1959. "I thought she was 
incredible. She didn't act. She was. She knocked me out." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury, who lives in North Hollywood, confessed that she had few happy 
memories from her Great White Way days with Merman. "It was difficult. Merman 
was cold. When you acted with her, she looked at your forehead. She didn't 
relate. Her whole performance was totally centered around her. She didn't take 
anything from anybody, which is so different from Tyne, who lives off everybody 
and herself as well." 
</P>
<P>
"Tyne has that role of being a lady-cop type, a dramatist," said Susan Strader, 
whose husband, Tim, is a vice chairman of the Center board. "But her comedic 
timing and her belt-it-out singing voice are fantastic!" 
</P>
<P>
"I loved the show," said Tim Strader. "The first act was for the ladies. The 
second act (with scantily clad female strippers) was for the men!" 
</P>
<P>
Going from a sweet-and-simple type to a svelte stripper "is difficult because 
it happens so quickly on stage, in front of everybody," said Crista Moore, who 
plays Gypsy Rose Lee in the production. "There's no time to prepare, think, or 
wind up to it. But that also makes the part exciting." 
</P>
<P>
As guests and cast members heaped their plates with goodies such as pineapple 
pizza and chocolate cake embellished with roses (natch!), pianist Confrey 
Phillips entertained with selections from the show. "I played at the 
opening-night party for the movie 'Gypsy' when it premiered at the Odeon 
theater in London," Phillips recalled. "It was nice to meet Natalie Wood (who 
played Gypsy Rose Lee). I always fancied her, thought she was a marvelous, 
lovely looking lady."

Non-Farm Income Rises: Led by big payroll gains in the West, personal income 
for non-farm workers rose by 9.4% in the first quarter of 1989 from a year ago, 
the Commerce Department said. In its regional survey, the department said 
income jumped a strong 15% in Nevada, followed by 12.1% in Florida and 10.7 in 
California -- the three fastest growing states in the nation. For the entire 
nation, non-farm personal income stood at an annualized $4.23 trillion in the 
first quarter, compared to $3.87 trillion in the first quarter 1988. The 
figures are not adjusted for inflation, which is now running at a 5.9% annual 
rate at the consumer level.

An "obsessive fan" charged in the slaying of actress Rebecca Schaeffer had 
hired a private detective to track down her address a month before allegedly 
shooting her to death outside her apartment, Los Angeles police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Robert John Bardo, 19, of Tucson, contacted the Anthony Agency, a 
private investigative company in his hometown, to say "he was writing to 
(Schaeffer) and wanted to send her a present," said William Johnson, an 
employee of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked for a mailing address," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bardo, who is being held in Tucson in lieu of $1-million bail, had indicated on 
a form he filled out at the agency that he and Schaeffer knew each other from 
another state and were friendly, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency was unable to obtain the information sought by Bardo in Arizona, so 
it hired a person in California, whom Johnson was unable to identify. Johnson 
said that individual obtained the information by running a check of Schaeffer's 
driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was unclear exactly how the Anthony Agency obtained Schaeffer's 
address, Department of Motor Vehicles spokeswoman Janet Baker in Sacramento 
said the DMV will provide -- for a fee ranging from $1 to $5 -- an address of 
any registered motorist as long as whoever is making the request has a license 
plate number. 
</P>
<P>
The same information can also be obtained from the DMW by providing it with a 
name and driver's license number or with a name and date of birth. Baker said 
there is no way for celebrities to block access to the information on their 
driver's licenses. The only exception is made for law enforcement officials.

REGENTS HALT HUTTENBACK'S PAY

University of California regents today announced the suspension without pay of 
former UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Robert Huttenback, pending appeal of his 
conviction for misusing school discretionary funds to finance home 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
UC spokesman Paul West said the decision was reached on the second day of 
meetings by the regents held at UC San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Huttenback, a history professor, was chancellor of UC Santa Barbara for nine 
years. He resigned before his conviction and continued to draw his salary as a 
tenured professor. After the conviction he was suspended from teaching, but 
still continued to draw pay. 
</P>
<P>
Huttenback, 61, insisted again today that he was innocent and blamed the 
university's "confusing" policy on a chancellor's use of discretionary funds 
and failure to explain the matter publicly for his problems.

JAIL ESCAPEE CAPTURED IN CASTAIC

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who slipped away from a minimum-security lockup in Saugus was captured 
this morning, a short while after he knocked on a Castaic resident's door and 
said he needed a change of clothing because he had escaped from jail, the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwardo Osuna, 18, was captured at 1 a.m. outside a McDonald's restaurant in 
the 27700 block of Lake Hughes Road in Castaic, Deputy Pat Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
About six hours earlier, Osuna and another inmate, Ismael Mendoza, 25, had 
walked away from the Peter Pitchess Honor Rancho, Hunter said. Mendoza was 
still at large. Both men had been serving short terms at the Saugus facility 
for narcotics convictions. 
</P>
<P>
About midnight, deputies were alerted by a Castaic resident that a man had 
knocked on his door and asked for a change of clothing, admitting he needed the 
clothes because he had escaped from prison. 
</P>
<P>
The resident said he gave the man a red T-shirt with a slogan printed on it. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies later spotted a man wearing such a shirt and arrested him after he was 
identified as Osuna. He is being held at the Santa Clarita sheriff's substation 
jail, a maximum-security jail.

PACOIMA DRIVE-BY SHOOTING HURTS 3

<TEXT>
<P>
Three men who had just finished playing soccer on a school field in a Pacoima 
area frequented by gang members were wounded in a drive-by shooting, Los 
Angeles police said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Although the three Pacoima men are not gang members, their assailants 
apparently believed that they were, Detective Jay St. John said. At about 9 
p.m. Thursday, two or three men in a red car drove by the victims at the corner 
of Pierce Street and Glenoaks Boulevard, shouted a gang challenge and then 
opened fire, St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
Injured were Guillermo Martinez, 21, who was struck in the chest; Carlos Lopez, 
27, who was wounded in the face, and Benigno Gonzalez, 25, who was struck in 
the legs. Martinez and Lopez were taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission 
Hills, where Martinez was in serious condition and Lopez was treated and 
released. Gonzalez was taken to Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley, 
where he was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made. St. John said the victims had been playing soccer at 
Maclay Junior High School, located at the same corner, until dark. They then 
walked across the street to a service station to use a pay phone when the 
shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
St. John said the corner area is a place where gang members often meet or pass 
through while traveling between housing projects in the area.

A Philippine Airlines jet carrying 98 people overshot an airport runway during 
a rainstorm today and slammed through traffic on a busy highway, killing eight 
people in their cars, police said. 
</P>
<P>
No one aboard the British Aircraft Corp. BAC 1-11 plane was killed but at least 
85 passengers and two flight attendants were injured, PAL spokesman Enrique 
Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
Four people on the ground were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
The dead were crushed in their cars when the twin-engine BAC 1-11 jet careened 
onto Manila's 12-lane South Expressway, said witnesses and officials at nearby 
hospitals. The plane then came to rest on a railroad track. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
93 Passengers 
</P>
<P>
The plane had carried 93 passengers and five crew members on a flight from the 
southern city of Zamboanga, Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred during a heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
Crash survivor Roberto Mendoza, 56, said the aircraft bounced several times and 
skidded before coming to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
"The pilot tried the brakes but the plane continued to skid. Then that's it -- 
bang! -- the plane hit something on the ground and came to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
"When it stopped, the windows shattered and I jumped out. I thought I landed on 
the wings but then I found out it was the roof of a house," said Mendoza, who 
suffered a gash to his head. 
</P>
<P>
"We landed, three, four, five, six times on the runway. We were actually 
bouncing," said David Tillson, a tourist from Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Santos declined to speculate on the cause of the accident, saying that would be 
left to an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Visibility was within (safe) limits for landing" despite the rainstorm, Santos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the belly of the British Aircraft Corp. jet was ripped open. 
</P>
<P>
Officials closed the highway to facilitate the rescue operation, which was 
hampered by the heavy rain and traffic jams on streets leading to the scene.

TOLL IN UNITED DC-10 CRASH RISES TO 109

The death toll in the United DC-10 crash was raised to 109 today with two 
people unaccounted for, and investigators reported that repair work had been 
done on the plane the day before the flight. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Hank Sinda said at a news conference that 109 bodies had been 
recovered by late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sinda reported 184 survivors from United Airlines Flight 232, which if there 
are two missing persons would bring the total aboard to 295. That figure 
conforms to the total reported Thursday by National Transportation Safety Board 
officials. United was sticking by its previous figure of 293 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investigators focused on the plane's No. 2, or rear engine, which 
was found to be missing its fan after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
NTSB member Jim Burnett said the board had examined the last 20 maintenance 
write-ups for the plane, including repair work done on the pneumatic system the 
day before the crash. The pneumatic system affects air pressure in the engine, 
air-conditioning and pressurization systems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know of no connection between the pneumatic system and anything that would 
have, could have, affected the functioning of the engine," he said this morning 
on NBC's "Today" show.

3 SOVIET WARSHIPS VISIT NAVAL BASE IN NORFOLK

Three Soviet warships steamed into the Norfolk Naval Base today for a five-day 
good-will visit that will include cookouts, sightseeing tours and shopping 
sprees. 
</P>
<P>
The visit to the Navy's largest base is the second time since World War II that 
Soviet warships have docked in the United States. Three Soviet vessels visited 
Boston harbor in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The guided-missile cruiser Marshal Ustinov, the destroyer Otlichny and the 
oiler Genrikh Gasanov docked at Pier 7 about 8:30 a.m. after exchanging 21-gun 
salutes with Ft. Monroe at the entrance to the Hampton Roads harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"They're sharp-looking. The sailors look good," said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. John 
Lloyd as he watched from the pier. "They did an impressive job of ship handling 
when they reached the pier." 
</P>
<P>
The 1,100 Soviet sailors will spend much of their time mingling with sailors at 
the base. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to have barbecues, cookouts," said Capt. Paul W. Hanley, an 
Atlantic Fleet spokesman. "We expect there will be quite a lot of 
person-to-person contact." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet sailors will tour the Navy base, eat at a pizza parlor and 
McDonald's, visit a shopping mall and grocery and hardware stores and take a 
bus trip to the Busch Gardens amusement park in Williamsburg. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets will reciprocate the hospitality by opening two of the ships to 
visitors and offering performances by a song-and-dance troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, three Navy ships will visit the Soviet Black Sea port of 
Sevastopol. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange program was arranged last summer when Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, 
the Soviet chief of staff, visited the United States as the guest of Adm. 
William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

HOTEL QUEEN HELMSLEY SHOWS ANOTHER FACE AT HER TRIAL

<P>
The portrait of Leona Helmsley emerging in a Manhattan courtroom bears little 
resemblance to the smiling queen of a real estate empire whose finicky 
attention to detail is trumpeted in slick magazine ads for her Helmsley Palace 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, both Leonas would demand the best. But the queen would pay for it, and 
the queen's English would be a bit more majestic. 
</P>
<P>
"You (expletive), you're not my partner; you don't tell me how to spend my 
money," Helmsley once said, according to a former underling who was a 
prosecution witness at her federal trial on extortion and tax fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, former Helmsley executive Jeremiah McCarthy, testified that 
Helmsley screamed at him when he refused to sign a phony voucher that billed 
work performed at her mansion to the Helmsley business. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, 69, and two former employees allegedly engaged in a false-invoice 
scheme and used company money to pay for $4 million in work on the Helmsleys' 
28-room estate in Greenwich, Conn. She is also accused of taking payoffs from 
Helmsley suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Her 80-year-old husband, Harry, was severed from the case because of a loss of 
memory caused by a series of slight strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the jury has heard only the prosecution case. The trial, ending its 
third week today, is expected to last two more months, and there is no 
indication of whether Leona Helmsley will take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony so far: 
</P>
<P>
 -- McCarthy said Helmsley once refused to pay a $13,000 bill to a contractor 
who had built a barbecue pit. McCarthy pleaded the contractor's case -- the man 
had six kids, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't he keep his pants on? He wouldn't have so many problems," Leona 
Helmsley said, according to the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elizabeth Baum, a former housekeeper at the mansion, recalled remarking to 
Leona Helmsley that the Helmsleys must pay a lot of taxes. She recalled her 
response: "We don't pay taxes; only the little people pay taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leona Helmsley told Steven Chang, a Helmsley engineer, to duplicate at the 
estate an underground sound system she had seen at Disney World. Chang said she 
charged the $57,000 cost to the business, and then fired him because the hidden 
speakers were not hidden enough and they once went on at 4:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer, Gerald A. Feffer, has done little to challenge the unpleasant 
portrait of his client, except to point out that the Helmsleys did pay $58 
million in taxes from 1983 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Feffer has gone out of his way to underscore Leona Helmsley's 
churlishness. In his opening statement, Feffer referred to her as a "tough 
bitch" who was "abrasive" and "demanding" because of the pressures applied to a 
woman who fought to succeed in a man's world.

CALFED CHAIRMAN TORRELL RESIGNS AFTER REQUEST FROM THE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move, John R. Torrell III resigned today as chairman, chief 
executive officer and president of CalFed Inc., parent of California Federal 
Bank, one of the nation's largest thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Torrell, who joined CalFed in mid-1988, said he was acceding to the wishes of 
CalFed's board. "In stepping aside during a time of momentum and progress at 
CalFed, I am accommodating the desire of the board to make a change at the 
helm," Torrell said. 
</P>
<P>
CalFed, based in Los Angeles, said senior executive Jerry St. Dennis has been 
appointed president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation comes about a month after reports surfaced that CalFed and 
GlenFed Inc., the parent of Glendale Federal Bank, had held merger talks in May 
but had broken them off. If the two companies had merged, it would have created 
the nation's largest thrift, with assets of more than $50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, CalFed Inc. reported sharply lower second-quarter earnings of 
$19.1 million, or 73 cents a share, off from $38.3 million, or $1.40 a share, 
for the 1988 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Michael Abrahams said he was "surprised but not shocked" about 
Torrell's resignation. Abrahams said he was uncertain if the move stemmed from 
the failed merger talks.

President Bush's clean-air bill, which was formally presented to Congress 
today, drew criticism from a key senator and environmentalists because it would 
ease an early draft's requirements for reducing motor vehicle pollution and 
provide wide government latitude to meet industry concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chief Senate sponsor of clean-air legislation, said 
the final language of Bush's bill "will significantly tarnish his image to be 
the environmental President." Baucus said the bill would increase motor vehicle 
emissions, allow cities too much time to clean air and give too much weight to 
cost in toxic chemical cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The latest version of the proposal would push back new vehicle emissions 
standards and would give the EPA administrator discretion to delay new 
regulations even further.

Taiwan today refused to allow American personnel to board and inspect two of 
its fishing vessels suspected of involvement in the sale of $1.3-million worth 
of illegal salmon, a U.S. government spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one of the two Taiwanese 
vessels attempted to ram a government-chartered boat that was shadowing it in 
the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Reed Boatwright, spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, said the Coast Guard cutter Morgenthau and another vessel were 
shadowing Taiwanese craft. 
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwanese have refused permission to board," Boatwright said. "It was 
fairly emphatic. Options are being prepared at the moment, but they are not 
beyond the draft stage." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, federal agents arrested two Taiwanese men as they emerged 
from a bank vault in Seattle carrying suitcases containing more than $1 million 
in cash that they allegedly received as payment for 500 metric tons of 
illegally caught salmon.

Gillette Co. stock climbed 62.5 cents a share in early trading today on news 
that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. had bought a $600-million stake in the company -- 
a purchase analysts saw as an anti-takeover effort.

<P>
Berkshire Hathaway bought $600 million in bonds yielding 8.75% that in two 
years are convertible to common stock equal to 11% of the company's outstanding

The investment makes Gillette, which has been the target of several takeover

The slumping Reds, hit hard by injuries in recent weeks, announced today that 
they have placed right fielder Paul O'Neill on the 21-day disabled list because 
he fractured his left thumb. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds said O'Neill, 26, who bats and throws left-handed, could be out six to 
eight weeks. He is leading the Reds in runs batted in with 62 this season, has 
14 home runs and is batting .287. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill suffered the injury in a futile attempt to catch a Tim Raines line 
drive in the sixth inning of Thursday night's 4-1 loss to the Expos in 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds said O'Neill's roster spot will be taken by Scotti Madison, 29, a 
catcher and outfielder who has played first base with the Reds' Class AAA 
Nashville farm team this year.

Tom Watson, searching for some golfing history in the misty Scottish haze he 
loves so well, regained instead a touch of the magic that once was his alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the golfer I was in 1980," the 39-year-old Watson said today, 'but 
there's still a lot of that in me." 
</P>
<P>
There was enough left to produce a 68 -- a scrambly, spectacular effort similar 
to those of his glory years -- that lifted him to within two strokes of the 
second round lead in the 118th British Open. And it afforded him a glimpse of 
the goal he's seeking, a sixth British Open Championship to match the record 
set by Harry Vardon in 1914.

"It was a mixed grill," Watson said of the four-under-par effort over the tame

hit some bad shots. I hit some great shots," he said, then shrugged. "It was a 
typical Tom Watson round." 
</P>
<P>
It included the luck and magic of a 60-foot sand shot that nestled into the cup 
for an eagle, along with a pair of 15-foot par-saving putts. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm in a good position to win. It's a matter of doing it. The 
desire is there; no question about it," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
His foremost obstacle at the moment is Wayne Grady, an Australian journeyman 
who has a history of second-place finishes, 26 of them in a globe-trotting 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Grady, who said he was "playing conservative, trying not to take on too much of 
the golf course," saved a 67 and reached the tournament halfway point at 135, 
nine shots under par. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, who once dominated the world game but has won only once in the last 
five years, was tied for second with Payne Stewart at 137. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, runner-up in the 1985 British Open, closed up with a course-record 65, 
breaking the mark set by Sandy Lyle, Tom Purtzer and Bobby Clampett in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Romero of Argentina, David Feherty of Northern Ireland and first round 
leader Wayne Stephens of England were another stroke back at 138. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a very easy Troon today," Watson said of the gentle breezes and 
cool, misty drizzle. "The golf course had no teeth in it." 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Open champ Scott Simpson, among others, took full advantage. He 
birdied half the holes he played in a round of 66. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson was tied at 139, four back, with Mark McCumber, Fred Couples, Steve 
Pate, Mark Calcavecchia, Australian Greg Norman and a pair of Englishmen, 
Derrick Cooper and Mark James. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino could do no better than a 73 and was at 141. Masters champ Nick 
Faldo of England had another 71 and was at 142. U.S. Open champ Curtis Strange 
was at 144 after a 74. Three-time British Open winner Jack Nicklaus shot 71 for 
145. 
</P>
<P>
While Watson and Stewart were advancing among the leaders, some of the European 
stars who have dominated this tournament in recent years quietly slipped back 
into the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the defending champion and a three-time British Open 
title-holder, took a 73 after missing six-foot putts on the last three holes 
and was at 145.

DURAN FAVORED AS LEONARD'S NOV. 2 OPPONENT

Promoter Bob Arum has planned a Wednesday press conference at Roseland in New 
York to announce Sugar Ray Leonard's Nov. 2 opponent at Caesars Palace in Las 
Vegas, and the betting is that Roberto Duran, not Thomas Hearns, will emerge 
from behind the curtain. 
</P>
<P>
"We will definitely have a decision by this weekend," Arum said Thursday from 
his Las Vegas office. "Mike Trainer (Leonard's attorney-manager) has listened 
to offers from representatives of Duran and Hearns, and now he and Ray simply 
have to make the best business decision." 
</P>
<P>
For Leonard, who will be HBO's ringside commentator tonight at the Mike 
Tyson-Carl Williams heavyweight championship bout, that would seem to be a 
third match with Duran, who reestablished himself as a prime-time boxing 
attraction last fall by upsetting Iran Barkley to claim the middleweight crown.

U.S. LEADING W. GERMANY 1-0 IN DAVIS CUP SEMIFINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Last-minute substitute Brad Gilbert rallied to beat Carl-Uwe Steeb in five sets 
today and gave the United States a 1-0 lead over defending champion West 
Germany in their Davis Cup semifinal in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, filling in for the injured John McEnroe, downed Steeb 6-2, 2-6, 2-6, 
6-4, 6-4 in just under three hours before a subdued capacity crowd of 12,300 at 
Olympic Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was crucial for the United States because it means the American 
team will gain at least a split on the opening day of the best-of-five-matches 
series. With West German ace Boris Becker scheduled to play Andre Agassi in the 
second match, the U.S. team needed to win the opener to avoid a possible 0-2 
deficit going into Saturday's doubles match. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will play the victor of the Sweden-Yugoslavia semifinal for the 
Davis Cup championship in December. The United States has not won the Davis Cup 
since 1982 and has not reached the final since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In Bastad, Sweden, Jonas Svensson and Mats Wilander gave Sweden a commanding 
2-0 lead over Yugoslavia in their semifinals after both men won their singles 
matches today. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, ranked fourth in the world, struggled early but then turned it into a 
rout as he posted a 7-6, 6-1, 6-0 win over Goran Prpic. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Svensson beat teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic 6-4, 7-6, 3-6, 6-4 on the 
slow clay. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden, trying to reach the final for the seventh consecutive year, has never 
lost a Davis Cup best-of-five-matches series after winning the first two 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Edberg, who was replaced by Svensson in singles after spraining his 
ankle last weekend, and Anders Jarryd are heavily favored to wrap up the 
semifinal in Saturday's doubles. 
</P>
<P>
The reverse singles are set for Sunday at this seaside resort in southern 
Sweden.

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES SEIZE TWO TINY SOUTHLAND S&amp;LS

Two small Southern California savings and loans were taken over Thursday by 
federal authorities, officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
The two insolvent institutions are Sierra Federal Savings, a one-office savings 
and loan on North Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills with $49 million in assets, 
and American Interstate Savings, which has its corporate headquarters in Costa 
Mesa and operates a single office on South Figueroa in Los Angeles. American 
Interstate Savings has $27 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The savings and loans were among seven institutions in California, Florida, 
Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and Tennessee that were placed in 
conservatorship Thursday as part of a joint regulatory program by the Federal 
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the federal agency that insures deposits at 
member thrifts, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which backs funds on 
deposit in member commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
The moves were taken in preparation for expected congressional passage of a 
massive savings and loan bailout. By putting the institutions into 
conservatorship, the government is seeking to minimize losses and limit risk 
until Congress provides the money to close them or subsidize their sale. 
</P>
<P>
The government transformed the seized S&amp;Ls into new mutual associations, 
effectively wiping out any subordinated debt and stockholder positions. For 
unexplained reasons, Sierra Federal's name will be changed to Clover Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan; the Costa Mesa thrift will remain American Interstate 
Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Williams, a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said 
depositors are unaffected by the action. He said neither of the two California 
institutions have a very active retail business but instead cater to money 
brokers, who place large amounts of money in institutions that offer high 
"jumbo" rates.

GATES VOWS TO LOBBY PANEL TO FREE BILL ON TAX ELECTION FOR JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates on Thursday vowed to lobby an Assembly committee to 
win approval for a bill that would allow Orange County to ask voters to 
consider a half-cent sales tax increase next year for new jail and courthouse 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and other supporters of a new jail at Gypsum Canyon, one of the projects 
that would be advanced by such a tax, hit a roadblock Wednesday, when the 
Assembly Local Government Committee decided to combine the county measure, 
sponsored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), with three similar 
bills and take them up as a package after legislators return from their summer 
break in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
That would make it more difficult for lawmakers to pass the tax increase before 
the Sept. 15 adjournment and would lessen chances that the issue could be 
placed on county ballots in June, 1990, Bergeson said. 
</P>
<P>
A half-cent tax would generate an estimated $121 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's chairman, Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose), said he 
wanted the delay to examine similar proposals in Los Angeles, Riverside and 
Humboldt counties to make sure that they would be constitutional if approved by 
the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Dominic Cortese doesn't play God with the rest of state," Gates said 
Thursday. "We're going to be working extra hard to get him to change his mind." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the jail site, who say building a facility at the canyon would 
be too costly and disrupt nearby neighborhoods, said the delay is a sign that 
the measure is not feasible in a county that tends to vote against increased 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth, who opposed the Gypsum Canyon site near Anaheim Hills 
when the Board of Supervisors voted, 3-2, in July, 1987, to build a new jail 
there, repeated his opposition Thursday and expressed doubt that county voters 
would approve such a tax anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great doubts that the people will vote for it," said Roth, who 
represents Anaheim. "I don't think this thing is going anywhere anyway." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roth Cites Costs 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he opposes the new jail site because of its cost. The first phase 
would cost $300 million, excluding the price of the land, he said. Buying the 
site would increase the cost by at least another $30 million -- providing that 
the Irvine Co., which owns much of the land around the site, agrees to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's irresponsible to spend millions on a site we don't own," Roth said. "I 
can't support a jail in Gypsum Canyon because it doesn't make economical 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's bill is considered by county officials to be the only politically 
viable option to help solve a jail overcrowding crisis that Gates has estimated 
will force him to give early release to thousands of prisoners each year. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and the county are under a federal court order to relieve overcrowding in 
existing jails. 
</P>
<P>
"I need a facility," Gates said Thursday. "I can't do my job." 
</P>
<P>
Residents oppose building a jail at the canyon site and have qualified an 
initiative for the June, 1990, ballot that would restrict new jail construction 
to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Impact on Values, Study Says 
</P>
<P>
But a recent county report predicted that the proposed 6,720-inmate, 
maximum-security jail would have no impact on surrounding property values or 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I would challenge anyone to show me where in the county the property values 
haven't gone up," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who supports the site, 
said he hopes that the bill will be passed by the Legislature and signed by the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a happy situation, but I still somehow have the faith that this 
situation in the Assembly committee can be resolved," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rick Violett, president of the citizens group Taxpayers for a Centralized 
Jail, said the delay in Sacramento could force county officials to build jails 
with other counties in areas isolated from residential neighborhoods or to 
construct one next to county court facilities in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to put it on the ballot, it had better be a decent plan," 
Violett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Berguson to Keep Pushing 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson, returning from the capital Thursday, pledged to continue pushing the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an apparent awareness (on the Assembly panel) that we're unhappy with 
the decision," she said. "It can't be put on the back burner. . . . That's 
totally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
The senator warned that the bill, which expires if not passed before 
legislators break, is not specific to the Gypsum Canyon site. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to keep the site neutral," Bergeson said. "The point is, we're 
releasing hard-core criminals, and that's fast becoming a health and safety 
crisis."
