PAUL REPS; WRITINGS SPREAD ZEN PHILOSOPHY IN THE WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Reps, a spiritualist and writer whose book "Zen Flesh, Zen Bones" became a 
textbook for the 1960s counterculture generation, has died. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
Reps, also a poet and artist, died July 12 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
His "picture poems," a combination of poetry and Japanese-style black ink 
paintings, were included in many of his books and exhibited in galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Reps graduated from Dartmouth in 1918 and worked 
for a New York bank. He became intrigued with Eastern philosophy by reading the 
Upanishads, ancient Indian treatises relating man to the universe, and the 
"Bhagavad-Gita," a sacred Hindu philosophical dialogue, in the New York Public 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
Reps sold his belongings, worked his way to India on a freighter and spent 
several years studying Buddhism in India, Burma, Japan and China. He 
concentrated on the Zen sect of Buddhism, which advocates seeking enlightenment 
through meditation and introspection. 
</P>
<P>
Moving to Los Angeles, Reps worked with Zen monk and scholar Nyogen Senzaki to 
compile three collections of Zen writings, "The Gateless Gate" in 1934, "10 
Bulls" in 1935 and "101 Zen Stories" in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Reps included much of the material in those volumes in his larger work, "Zen 
Flesh, Zen Bones," which was published in 1957 and is still in print. Quickly 
embraced by American youth, the book helped spread the Zen philosophy to the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Reps followed that with the books "Zen Telegrams" in 1959, "Unwrinkling Plays" 
in 1965, "Square Sun, Square Moon" in 1967 and "Gold Fish Signatures" in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Among his writings was a series of articles for the Los Angeles Times on the 
psychological meaning of names. 
</P>
<P>
Reps' most recent book was "Let Good Fortune Jump on You" in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by three nieces.

LAURA PERLS; HELPED DEVELOP GESTALT THERAPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laura Perls, 84, widow of and a collaborator with her husband, Fritz, in the 
founding of the Gestalt school of psychotherapy. In the 1940s and '50s, the 
Perlses and others developed a blend of therapy that borrowed from Sigmund 
Freud, psychodrama and a German theory called gestalt in which the turmoils of 
childhood were subordinated to the treatment of current emotional conflicts. 
Today, Gestalt therapy has come to be a preferred approach by many analysts and 
other mental health workers. 
</P>
<P>
She trained as a psychoanalyst in Germany and practiced in New York after her 
husband's death in 1970 but moved to her birthplace in Pforzheim, West Germany, 
earlier this year to be near her daughter. She died there on July 13 of a 
thyroid condition.

AGENCY CRITICIZED OVER SEAWATER INTRUSION; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: AN INDUSTRY GROUP SAYS MORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO PREVENT 
SEEPAGE INTO FRESH GROUND-WATER SUPPLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An association of geologists and drilling contractors Friday accused the agency 
in charge of managing the county's ground water of incompetency for failing to 
prevent seawater intrusion in water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency should have pursued methods to 
reclaim treated waste water and found means to store more water during wet 
years in preparation for periods of drought such as the past three years, an 
industry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Barbour, a member of the Ventura County and Los Angeles chapter of the 
California Groundwater Assn., said inaction by the agency has allowed seawater 
to continue to creep into fresh ground-water supplies, threatening drinking and 
irrigation supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"Correcting seawater intrusion was a job given to an agency that hasn't done 
its job," Barbour said. "It's time somebody did something." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John K. Flynn, a member of the board of the Groundwater Management 
Agency, said the industry's accusation stems from a motive for financial gain 
and ignorance of the agency's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
Since its creation in 1982, the Groundwater Management Agency has drilled 
deeper wells to abate further intrusion into shallow underground pools and has 
helped the United Water Conservation District with its Freeman Diversion Dam, 
which is intended to capture and store additional water during wet years. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the agency is enacting ordinances to prevent pumpers from extracting more 
water than rainfall can replace, Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made phenomenal progress," Flynn said. The industry group is afraid 
that restrictions on pumping, and consequently on drilling jobs, will become a 
statewide practice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are opposed to all ground-water management in California," he said of the 
industry group. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's accusation came as the Groundwater Management Agency extended an 
emergency ordinance banning drilling of new wells for another six months. The 
temporary ordinance, enacted in January, is expected to be permanent in six 
months. It forbids new wells but allows for the replacement or repair of 
existing wells. 
</P>
<P>
The agency on Friday also set Aug. 9 for a hearing and adoption of a second, 
more far-reaching ordinance that would cut well-water pumping by 25% by the 
year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinances are necessary to retard the advance of seawater into the shallow 
Oxnard and Mugu underground water basins, called aquifers. Since the 1920s, 
growers on the Oxnard Plain have pumped more water from the basins than 
rainwater could recharge, a condition called overdrafting. 
</P>
<P>
Tests late last year revealed that saltwater had moved into the edge of the 
deep Fox Canyon Aquifer, previously believed to be uncontaminated by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The Groundwater Management Agency, led by a board of appointed directors and 
staffed by county employees, was formed in 1982 as a policy-making agency to 
manage the ground-water basin and prevent further seawater intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's formation averted action by the State Water Resources Control 
Board in 1981, which threatened to take over the United Water Conservation 
District's efforts to stop seawater intrusion. Also, the agency's formation 
enabled the county to receive $8 million in federal money to pass to United for 
projects to stop the intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
The United Water Conservation District is responsible for recharging 
ground-water supplies and regulating pumping for wells in its jurisdiction. 
That area includes the Oxnard Plain and the Santa Clara River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
United was recently warned by the State Water Resources Control Board that the 
district must show why it has failed to stop the seawater intrusion or face a 
reinstatement of the 1981 state board action to appoint a judge, called an 
adjudicator, to oversee the seawater abatement program. 
</P>
<P>
United, however, said the board was only looking for an update on United 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
But Barbour said the state board's action validates the position of the 
industry's association. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is being done to remediate the problem," Barbour said.

LEMON FIRM ACCUSED OF GIVING BEST JOBS TO MEN; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUITS: THE PACKINGHOUSE ASSOCIATION SAYS IT ENCOURAGED FEMALE WORKERS TO 
SEEK PROMOTIONS. A FOUR-YEAR LEGAL BATTLE NEARS THE END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of Ventura County's largest lemon-packing associations was accused Friday 
of reserving high-paid jobs for men by an attorney suing the packinghouse on 
behalf of a group of former female employees. 
</P>
<P>
Despite years of seniority, female employees at the Saticoy Lemon Assn. were 
relegated to lower-paid jobs while men were promoted, said Paul Strauss, an 
attorney representing about 100 women in a class-action lawsuit against the 
company. Women holding those jobs were also more likely to be laid off when the 
picking season ended, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The bitter 4-year-old legal dispute between the packinghouse and the group 
neared an end as lawyers for both sides presented closing arguments in Los 
Angeles Friday before U.S. District Court Judge John G. Davies. A decision is 
not expected for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has hinged on whether the Saticoy Lemon Assn., a group that runs 
packinghouses in five Ventura County cities, is responsible for the hiring 
policies of the Seaboard Lemon Assn., a company it acquired four years ago 
during a merger. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys representing the Saticoy Lemon Assn. contend that the federal lawsuit 
was filed after the May, 1986, merger and therefore does not apply to the new 
company. 
</P>
<P>
During that merger, Seaboard's two packinghouses in Oxnard became part of a 
network of packinghouses Saticoy already owned. The lawsuit, however, contends 
that Seaboard's policies regarding female workers continued after the 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
George Preonas, an attorney defending Saticoy, maintains that the company never 
violated those laws and has in fact encouraged women to apply for all jobs it 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed by the women contends that the company violated and continues to 
violate federal anti-discrimination laws and seeks a court order barring the 
Saticoy Lemon Assn. from further alleged discriminatory practices. 
</P>
<P>
It also seeks compensation for the plaintiffs, including back pay and 
promotions the female workers would have received had they not been subjected 
to the alleged discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
A key study used in the case against Saticoy indicated that women with two to 
15 years of experience received substantially less pay than men with the same 
level of experience at the packinghouse, Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
Women workers received on the average gross annual wages of $5,646 a year, 
compared with average gross annual wages of $15,189 for men, according to the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity existed because the jobs women held as sorters, packers and 
washers were not as highly paid as jobs held by men, Strauss said. The men 
worked as supervisors, shipping clerks, mechanics and lift operators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Preonas, in an interview outside the courtroom, said those comparisons are 
inaccurate. The study tries to compare men and women at different job 
classifications working at different times of the year, he said. Many of the 
jobs at the packinghouses are seasonal. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Saticoy's wages have been assigned according to job skill, not sex, 
Preonas said. Most of the people who have been allowed to work as general 
laborers, for example, are men because it requires heavy labor. Saticoy 
managers "gave women workers jobs they could succeed at," Preonas said in court 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Preonas said Saticoy has encouraged women to seek jobs dominated by men, but 
they have declined to apply. "No woman was ever denied the opportunity to 
submit an application on a day when men were submitting applications," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Saticoy Lemon Assn. runs lemon packinghouses in Santa Paula, Oxnard, 
Montalvo, Ventura and Saticoy, but the class-action lawsuit only covers an 
estimated 100 women who worked at two packinghouses in Oxnard before the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys representing the female employees contend that Saticoy's practices 
went further than hiring women only for certain jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss said that shortly after the merger with Seaboard, the newly formed 
Saticoy Lemon Assn. refused to accept applications from the former Seaboard 
employees because they were reserved for men. 
</P>
<P>
Sofia Gonzalez of Oxnard, one of the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit, initially 
filed a complaint with the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1975 and 1985, Gonzalez said in the complaint, she worked as a packer 
and sorter and was never promoted. Gonzalez was laid off just before the merger 
of Saticoy and Seaboard. But when she later sought a job with the new company, 
Gonzalez was not hired while men with less or no experience were hired ahead of 
her, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
Two former Seaboard employees who attended the court proceedings Friday also 
complained of being passed over when they tried to apply at Saticoy after the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview outside the courtroom, Leticia Ortiz, 28, of Oxnard said she 
earned about $4,000 a year working as a packer and sorter at Seaboard. Ortiz 
said she applied repeatedly for jobs such as mechanic and general laborer, but 
was always told those jobs were reserved for men. She was never called back, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to apply for a mechanic's job, but they never gave us the 
opportunity," said Ortiz, who worked six years for Seaboard before she was laid 
off in 1984. "They gave them to the men, but to the women, no."

<P>
Outspoken Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who subbed for syndicated 
broadcaster Rush Limbaugh this week, obviously hasn't had as much practice as 
Limbaugh when it comes to reaching for the "kill-switch." That's the time-delay 
device that enables talk-show hosts to bleep out obscenities uttered by 
callers. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of Dornan's stint, broadcast on member station KFI, one caller 
branded the congressman a ". . . Nazi" before he was cut off. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, there was no chance of that caller's adjective getting past Only in 
L.A.'s "kill-switch." 
</P>
<P>
Movie-makers have been known to isolate positive-sounding blurbs from 
unfavorable reviews and quote them in ads. 
</P>
<P>
The Church of Scientology, whose controversial inner workings were recently 
revealed in an analytical six-part series in The Times, seems to have taken a 
similar tact. 
</P>
<P>
Scientology is now running ads on billboards and RTD buses that say: 
</P>
<P>
" 'There is little question that Scientology is here to stay -- and doing its 
best to meet expectations . . .' -- Joel Sappell and Robert W. Welkos, Los 
Angeles Times." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the movement replied: "The L.A. Times gave the Church of 
Scientology widespread exposure and now we return the favor." 
</P>
<P>
C an it be that interest in a seminar with the compelling theme "Malibu: 
Microcosm for Surfriding's Future" is at low ebb? 
</P>
<P>
Hard to believe but that may be the case. Geosurf Symposium 1990 originally 
announced a $90 ticket price for today's event at Pepperdine University. Since 
cresting at that figure, the price has plunged to $15. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of this week's Dueling Signs Competition is the head-spinning photo 
taken in Hollywood's Barnsdall Park by Jerry Martz. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the "Bevery" Glen street sign, pictured here recently, has been 
corrected, if it was, indeed, a misspelling. Kerem Bilge, a psychology major at 
nearby UCLA, points out that "bever" in British English means "tremble" or 
"shiver." He noticed the "Bevery" spelling during that nervous period known as 
finals week. So his theory is that "the city temporarily renamed the street 
'Trembling Glen' just to show solidarity with us Bruins." 
</P>
<P>
During Mensa's recent convention, Diana Altman bid $186 at an auction for what 
spokesman Ken Rosenhek described as "a gifted kid." 
</P>
<P>
It was a 20-day-old goat. The little critter, donated by some Mensa members 
from Washington, was then given to a Maryland family that has a farm. In all, 
the auction raised $8,000 for the gifted children's fund of the high-IQ 
society. 
</P>
<P>
The goat attended the convention at the Anaheim Marriott Hotel and presented no 
problems. "It's potty-trained," Rosenhek explained. 
</P>
<P>
Our Only in L.A. Weekend Menu Item will be offered this morning at Perkins 
Palace during the Pasadena Chili Cookoff, a fund-raiser for abused children. It 
promises to have lots of bite. Layne Wootten of RJ's restaurant in Beverly

A cartoon in the New Yorker depicts a man talking to his wife while watering 
the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I like about L.A.?" he says. "We don't have to be interesting 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
In reply, L.A. magazine should run a cartoon of a man saying to his wife in 
their cramped living room: 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I like about Manhattan? We don't have a lawn to water anymore."

One orange drink concoction that was invented in L.A. in 1926 is said to have

11 DISABLED PUPILS CAMP OUT AT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For many Southern California junior high school students, Friday was just 
another day at the beach. But for 11 severely handicapped students at Richard 
B. Haydock Junior High, it was the chance to prove their independence. 
</P>
<P>
The students, who suffer from severe physical and mental disabilities, were 
allowed to participate Thursday and Friday in an overnight beach camp-out at 
McGrath State Beach. Many of the children in the program have Down's syndrome 
and are either blind or deaf, or both. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Brekke, superintendent of the Oxnard Elementary School District, said it 
was the first time the district took the students on an overnight camping trip. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that because of its success it will become an annual event," 
Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
The daily curriculum in Beth Jacobs' class teaches the students how to handle 
financial transactions, ride the bus, cook simple meals and many other skills 
most people take for granted. "These programs emphasize students developing 
their self-sufficiency and independence," Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching assistant and parent Connie Wilbur said the vocational training, 
individualized treatment and attention the students receive make it possible 
for them to overcome their disabilities and survive in the community. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard Elementary School District has hired several graduates of the 
program -- a gardener, an assistant cook and a teacher's aide. 
</P>
<P>
"If these kids didn't have this program," Wilbur said, "they'd be in a state 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
The camp-out was the culmination of the curriculum, a chance for the students 
to test themselves away from the familiar territories of home and school. The 
children, who range in age from 12 to 14, saw two schools of dolphins offshore, 
learned the "right" way to eat an Oreo cookie -- carefully twist the cookies 
apart and then lick them -- and told ghost stories. 
</P>
<P>
For some of them, the camping trip was a rare opportunity to get out. Student 
Mara Davenport, of Oxnard has one parent who is confined to a wheelchair and 
another who can barely walk. The family lives in a trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching Assistant Margie Banales, watching Mara run along the beach, said she 
is "like a little bird set free . . . she is so motivated to learn and 
experience new things." DAVID PRESTON

ANTONOVICH SAYS LANDFILL VOTE SHOULD BE DELAYED; 
</P>
<P>
DUMP: OPPONENTS OF THE PROPOSED EXPANSION OF SUNSHINE CANYON WOULD HAVE ANOTHER 
MONTH TO STATE THEIR CASE BEFORE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MAKES ITS FINAL 
DECISION. 
</P>

Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich on Friday said opponents of the 
Sunshine Canyon landfill expansion project should be given an extra month to 
make their case against the dump, a move sharply criticized by the canyon's 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said Antonovich will ask the Board of Supervisors to order county 
planners on Tuesday to postpone Wednesday's scheduled vote on Browning-Ferris 
Industries' application to operate a 524-acre landfill north of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a usual procedure Mike is asking for -- but this is not a usual 
project," said Rosa Kortizija, an Antonovich deputy. Antonovich intends to 
argue that it would be a mistake for the Regional Planning Commission to act so 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote by the planners on an environmental impact report would send the 
controversial project to the Board of Supervisors for a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich has said he will not make up his mind about the merits of the dump 
until after the Planning Commission finishes its deliberations. But efforts to 
mollify angry homeowners and environmentalists opposing the dump put Antonovich 
in a slightly different light. Only weeks ago, a group fighting the dump took 
plastic bags of garbage to his office to demonstrate their displeasure with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Good. It's grand," said Mary Edwards, secretary of the North Valley Coalition, 
of Antonovich's decision. The coalition is a homeowner-based group that has 
fought the Sunshine Canyon landfill for years. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said a delay is only fair. "If we're going to be stuck with their 
landfill for another 50 or 100 years, then we ought to have a few more weeks to 
look at the environmental documents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Chris Funk, an attorney for Browning-Ferris, the huge solid waste 
management firm that owns Sunshine Canyon, warned that if Antonovich gets his 
way, the county may face a temporary garbage disposal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Not opening the new, expanded Sunshine Canyon dump could leave the county 
without a place to put 6,500 tons of garbage each day, Funk said. There would 
be a "gap in the county's landfill capacity" if the Sunshine expansion landfill 
is not opened by September, 1991, when the existing Sunshine landfill is due to 
be closed by the city of Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Funk said Antonovich's proposal is inappropriate because the opponents have had 
ample opportunity to comment on the EIR and the Planning Commission formally 
closed the comment period in February. 
</P>
<P>
"When does it all end?" Funk said. "Are we going to have another round of 
comments and responses to comments and more comments on responses to comments. 
It sets a dangerous precedent." 
</P>
<P>
Funk said the public comment period had been 165 days when 90 days is normal. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said there were substantive environmental issues that the public has 
not had an opportunity to address. These include taking a fresh look at how two 
massive dumps -- Sunshine Canyon and Elsmere Canyon, a landfill proposed for 
development near Santa Clarita -- would affect north San Fernando Valley 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said she hoped that the extra time sought by Antonovich would give 
opponents a fair opportunity to deal with the issues raised by the new 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Funk, however, denied that any new issues have been raised in the proposed 
final EIR that warrant allowing the public yet more time to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich last Tuesday asked his Board of Supervisors colleagues to urge the 
Planning Commission to delay its consideration of the landfill project. But 
that motion failed on a 3-2 vote because it needed -- for procedural reasons 
that won't be applicable next Tuesday -- four votes. Only three votes will be 
needed next week to grant opponents another 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's latest motion also goes a step further than last week's. Last 
week, he had only urged a delay; now he's asking for a delay during which the 
public would have a chance to make additional remarks that will be reflected in 
the EIR. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the Los Angeles City Council's Board of Referred Powers is 
set to hear Browning-Ferris' application to operate an expanded landfill on 30 
acres the firm owns in another portion of Sunshine Canyon, located within the 
city of Los Angeles. A third landfill site in Sunshine Canyon was closed on 
July 1.

17-YEAR-OLD ENTERS NOT GUILTY PLEA IN DEAF MAN'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joey Paul Bellinger, a 17-year-old Long Beach boy accused of shooting and 
killing a deaf man and injuring the man's brother during a traffic dispute in 
Granada Hills last January, pleaded not guilty Friday in adult court to murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
The arraignment in San Fernando Municipal Court came after a Juvenile Court 
judge ruled last week that Bellinger was unfit to be prosecuted as a juvenile 
because of the seriousness of the charge. A preliminary hearing was set for 
Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger allegedly shot and killed Cesar Vieira, 30, and wounded Edward 
Vieira, 25, during the confrontation that began when Bellinger and other youths 
exchanged insults with the brothers at an intersection, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger, who would have been released at the latest by his 25th birthday if 
convicted in juvenile court, now faces more than 30 years in prison if 
convicted of the murder and attempted murder charges and allegations that he 
used a firearm and inflicted great injury. 
</P>
<P>
However, because Bellinger allegedly committed the crimes while a juvenile, a 
judge may impose the juvenile sentence if he is convicted -- meaning he would 
be released when he turns 25 -- or could order him sent to state prison after 
serving time in a California Youth Authority facility, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of a conviction, a third option, though a less likely one, would 
be to send him to prison from the beginning of his sentence, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Gerald T. Richardson, who presided over Friday's arraignment, 
ordered Bellinger held without bail at Central Juvenile Hall despite his 
attorney's request that bail be set. Richardson indicated that Bellinger 
presented a flight risk because he sought refuge with a family friend in 
Upstate New York after the Jan. 28 killing. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was arrested at the friend's house on March 2 after FBI agents 
received a tip about his whereabouts.

GEORGE H. BROWN; LONGTIME LITTON ENGINEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George H. Brown, a longtime engineer with Litton Data Systems in Van Nuys, has 
died in Mission Hills. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
Brown died Wednesday from complications of diabetes, said his wife, Shirlee 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Born June 8, 1929, in Seattle, Brown came to Los Angeles as an infant. He 
graduated from Fairfax High School in 1947 and served in the Air Force from 
1950 to 1954, achieving the rank of staff sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, he was hired as an engineer at Litton, where he worked until diabetes 
forced him to take a disability leave in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was a longtime member of the Sons of Norway Lodge No. 50 in Van Nuys, 
serving as president from 1984 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 36 years; his mother, Florence Steeves of Canoga 
Park; a brother, Bill Brown of Van Nuys; and a sister, Shirley Reel of 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Visitation is scheduled for 6 to 8 p.m. Sunday at Pierce Brothers Valhalla 
Mortuary, 10621 Victory Blvd., North Hollywood. A funeral service is planned 
for 11 a.m. Monday at St. David Episcopal Church, 11605 Magnolia Blvd., North 
Hollywood, with burial to follow at Pierce Brothers Valhalla Memorial Park. 
Donations can be made in Brown's name to the American Diabetes Assn. or the 
National Kidney Foundation.

THOUSAND OAKS COUNCILMAN'S INCONSISTENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am puzzled by the inconsistent views of Councilman Larry Horner regarding the 
need to maintain business character in Thousand Oaks versus the need to 
maintain residential character. 
</P>
<P>
He recently stated, "I'm going to be hard-nosed. . . . I'm not going to change 
the character of the business community because of advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, is he willing to change the character of residential neighborhoods 
because of rooming houses, which bring blight, traffic, drugs and crime? 
</P>
<P>
Horner's proposal, as chairman of the Code Enforcement Committee, will reduce 
residential zoning standards in violation of the city's ordinances that apply 
to occupancy levels, street parking, fire codes and infrastructure. His 
proposal does not solve the existing problems with illegal multiple rentals. In 
the name of "solving the overcrowding and enforcement problems," his proposal 
will increase density, increase street parking and encourage rooming houses to 
spring up in family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
I hope homeowner associations and concerned citizens will not be deceived by 
slogans but will read the fine print.

PLANE MISHAP IN LONG BEACH HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You recently printed an article regarding an airplane crash in Long Beach 
Harbor ("2 Rescued After Plane Crashes Into Ocean," Part A, June 17). 
</P>
<P>
The author of this seems to have been misinformed; the aircraft never flew over 
the beach at low attitude and swerved into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The article also states that "Probert . . . told rescuers the plane may have 
run out of gas. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I was the pilot on this aircraft and know exactly what happened -- That is, one 
of the elevator control cables failed thus resulting in my having virtually no 
pitch control of the aircraft. Also, there was a failure of the landing gear 
system to retract as required prior to a water landing. The aircraft had 180 
gallons of fuel on board upon entry into the water at Long Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to land in the water rather than continue to Long Beach Airport 
was made solely upon the safety of others on the ground. That is to say, it is 
better to attempt a landing in the ocean with only two lives at risk than to 
fly over populated areas without assurance of not harming other people and 
property.

INDIVIDUALISM VS. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICY IN UC ADMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lisa M. Hatton questions whether the value of individualism and 
self-determination are being destroyed in the name of diversity as the 
University of California system wrestles with its commitment to student 
affirmative action (letter, July 12). 
</P>
<P>
She is one of the unfortunate many who believe that this world treats all 
people as individuals and that somehow the exceptional success stories of a 
nonwhite or a non-male person prove the notion that all you need to succeed in 
life is an individual drive. 
</P>
<P>
In actuality, such examples prove that because minority success stories are 
only the exceptions, the rule for the powerless is "failure" that results from 
structurally oppressive treatment by those in control of the structural 
hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The empirical data that Hatton draws on when she points out that "minority 
students are exactly those who drop out despite special enrollment and tutoring 
privileges" should stir up the question of what kind of campus climates are 
such students expected to "succeed" in, rather than assuming that the extremely 
high attrition rates of those students are somehow reflective of their innate 
"scholastic incompetency." 
</P>
<P>
If she took the time to look around the University of California campuses, she 
would notice that the tenured faculty, academic deans, and top administrators 
are predominantly white males. This is the harsh reality that defines the 
climate of UC campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"Diverse" student bodies are asked to play the campus game with rules set up 
and run by the powerful, and they are consistently blamed for coming out in 
last place. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if there will ever come a day when the process of denial for folks who 
vehemently express their intolerance for "reverse discrimination" is exchanged 
for the recognition of what affirmative action really is: a movement to salvage 
a historically elitist and skewed educational system, a movement triggered by 
the structural oppression of nonwhite and non-male students that has existed -- 
maybe in various disguises -- but always and already there.

BRENNAN: JUSTICE FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice William Brennan, who resigned his seat on the Supreme Court Friday, has 
been a towering figure in the history of American jurisprudence. The force and 
elegance of his many landmark opinions -- though sometimes controversial -- 
have made him one of the 20th Century's most influential Americans. They will 
stand as an enduring testament to the fundamental notion that law, untempered 
by humanity, is an instrument of coercion and not of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Many scholars rank the 84-year-old son of Irish Catholic immigrants as the 
greatest justice since John Marshall because, as Burt Neuborne put it, "Brennan 
knew how to blend his political instincts with a pervasive legal theory that 
transcended his personal views." 
</P>
<P>
According to Brennan, that theory derived from his belief that the 
Constitution's fundamental purpose is "the protection of the dignity of the 
human being and the recognition that every individual has fundamental rights 
which government cannot deny him." As he once said, "The genius of the 
Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have had in a world that 
is dead and gone, but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with 
current problems and current needs. The Constitution will endure as a vital 
charter of human liberty as long as there are those with the courage to defend 
it, the vision to interpret it and the fidelity to live by it." 
</P>
<P>
Though he certainly had critics who felt his philosophies were far too liberal, 
Brennan's influence was acute in cases involving freedom of expression, the 
rights of individuals accused of crimes and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of 
"equal protection of the laws." Brennan said he followed in the tradition of 
Chief Justice Earl Warren, who, Brennan said, always was concerned with people, 
"especially ordinary people -- the disadvantaged, the downtrodden, the poor, 
the friendless." 
</P>
<P>
So, too, was Brennan, whose retirement brings to mind the sentiments of another 
Irishman, William Butler Yeats: I am in despair that time may bring/Approved 
patterns of women or of men/But not that selfsame excellence again.

RAIL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The apparent popularity of the Blue Line has put more in motion than thousands 
of happy commuters. It also has injected new movement into stalled negotiations 
over unused right-of-ways that could form a new regional commuter-rail system. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year ago, the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads offered to 
sell the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC) five little-used 
branch lines totaling more than 200 miles of track. When combined with the 
county's right-of-ways, the lines would allow planners to assemble a mix of 
light- and heavy-rail lines stretching from San Bernardino to Santa Monica and 
from Santa Clarita to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, negotiations over the lines broke down in June, when the 
companies and the county were unable to agree on the formula for setting a 
price. Now both sides have announced a willingness to resume talks, though they 
also agree the monetary gulf is wide. But however gaping it may be, the Blue 
Line experience suggests that it's worth bridging. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the disastrous regional planning decisions made -- or, for that matter, 
not made -- over the past 30 years have been as obviously destructive as the 
dismantling of the 1,164-mile network of Red Car Trolley lines in 1961. To 
detail the consequences of that willful folly is to belabor what is obvious to 
every commuter who will spend unrecoverable hours of their lives next week 
stalled in traffic.

ECONOMIC SUMMIT IN HOUSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Columnist Alexander Cockburn ("Today's Terms of Confusion," Commentary, July 
12) was right on when he rapped American journalists for their inability to 
make world events comprehensible to the public. 
</P>
<P>
His case in point: the practice of characterizing those in the Soviet Union who 
want to go back to good old capitalism (pardon me, "the free market") as 
radicals, and those who still believe in socialism (wasn't that revolutionary 
yesterday?) as conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
In the same day's paper, and for a week before that, I plowed through a 
blizzard of babble about the Houston summit of the world's "seven 
industrialized democracies." (Isn't that another judgmental, 
self-congratulatory term?) I learned of the great triumph scored by President 
George Bush in arm-twisting the allies to agree to begin phasing out 
agricultural subsidies (Part A, July 12). 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere, except in one small, unexplained chart, did I read that the United 
States subsidizes agriculture, too. Or did the President sign that bill passed 
by Congress ending all price supports to American farmers one night earlier 
while I slept? Or better still, should we have former President Ronald Reagan 
explain parity again? 
</P>
<P>
Cockburn was wrong perhaps on one point. It's not just young people who are 
turned off by all this babble. It goes a long way toward explaining why most 
people are turned off and don't even bother to vote any more.

LIMITING SALES OF SPRAY PAINT TO CURB GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning the editorial regarding graffiti I would like to point out a few 
other people and organizations also working on this problem. 
</P>
<P>
We must congratulate Sen. Torres for his legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Locking up the cans is probably where it will go. Most of paint used for 
graffiti is stolen. 
</P>
<P>
There is another bill in the Legislature sponsored by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) which will put a tax on spray paint and this revenue will be used 
for graffiti cleanup and educational work related to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Many Los Angeles officials have worked together with VOICE over the past year 
on a major anti-graffiti campaign. Valley Organized in Community Efforts 
(VOICE) is a coalition of churches and synagogues in the San Fernando Valley. 
The City Council is proposing to lock up spray paint cans and use non-jail 
sentencing to clean up graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, all this work will come to fruition very soon.

LIMITING SALES OF SPRAY PAINT TO CURB GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have followed with interest the letters and editorials on graffiti. In fact, 
The Times did a story on me and my graffiti-plagued wall. 
</P>
<P>
No mention seems ever to be made of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
There is a San Fernando Valley company called Graffiti Prevention Systems. 
Phone: (800) 247-3395. This company completely solved the problem. 
</P>
<P>
I hired a painter to paint out all graffiti while their serviceman stood by. 
The moment the paint dried the serviceman sprayed on a coat of thin invisible 
wax. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning the wall had been vandalized again. But later in the day 
Graffiti Prevention arrived, steamed off the wax and the wall was pristine 
again. 
</P>
<P>
The first week they had to make several trips. After that word was apparently 
out that vandalism didn't last long on those particular walls. 
</P>
<P>
I paid Graffiti Prevention a monthly fee to be ready to melt off any further 
assaults. I think I needed to call them only once during the next several 
years, before the property was sold. 
</P>
<P>
I do not understand why no mention is ever made of the foolproof solution to 
the problem.

HANDCUFFING THE LOCALS IN TOBACCO WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The powerful tobacco lobby in Sacramento is close to obtaining legislation that 
would take away the authority of local communities to block distribution of 
cigarettes to minors. Like those fighting the war against illicit drugs, our 
local officials understand that while they cannot attack tobacco at the 
"source" by halting supply or advertising, they can "interdict" it in their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
They can stop tobacco peddlers from preying on the young by restricting 
cigarette vending machines and free samples. If these outlets are removed, 
common sense suggests that fewer kids will become smokers. 
</P>
<P>
The cigarette companies obviously agree or they would not be fighting so 
ferociously for legislation to block these local efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Legislature be pressured into putting the state's seal of approval on 
the promotion of America's deadliest drug to minors?

ANSWERS FROM BABY DOOMERS ON WHETHER THEY'RE APATHETIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why should it come as a surprise to anyone that America's youth are unlikely to 
comprehend much less take interest in public affairs ("Media Study Finds 'Age 
of Indifference,' " Part A, June 28). 
</P>
<P>
As a child of the eighties, I found the report less disheartening than comic. 
</P>
<P>
The very notion that today's youth -- unknowingly saddled with an economy in 
disarray, an ailing social welfare system, and an impending ecological disaster 
-- could fail "to find public events compelling" makes for a passable joke. 
</P>
<P>
What is really funny, though, is that older Americans -- having fed their 
children a steady diet of meaningless Hollywood fantasy, denied youth a proper 
education in favor of our "vital" defense budget, and left my generation with 
the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Andrew Dice Clay for role models -- 
could ever express shock at the situation. Ha ha ha ha.

LIMITING SALES OF SPRAY PAINT TO CURB GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torres' proposal to outlaw spray paint cans is one of the most stupid ideas to 
float out of our Legislature in some time. To outlaw a very useful device 
simply because the police cannot or will not enforce existing laws against a 
group of juveniles makes no sense. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, the problem is not a state matter but should be solved on 
the local level. If the police would put a fraction of as much effort -- as for 
example, they put into chasing prostitutes -- into trapping these pests, and 
then if the courts would simply impose deliberate and hurtful punishments, we 
could see the problem go away in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
There are enough laws on the books already to cope with these mindless vandals. 
We simply have to enforce the laws we have and then punish those who despoil 
our community. 
</P>
<P>
To say that they can't be fined because they have no assets overlooks what 
these creatures value. If they have no money, seize their bicycles or 
motorcycles. Skateboards and TV are fair game as well as the baseball caps and 
the T-shirts with the silly slogans. After we've impoverished them down to a 
few clean clothes and some schoolbooks, put them to work for a month of 
Sunda2037588073The message would get around.

A dinner in honor of Father Luis Olivares, the former pastor of Our Lady Queen 
of Angels Roman Catholic Church and a tireless crusader on behalf of Latino 
immigrants and refugees, has been postponed to Sept. 5. The event, chaired by 
Mayor Tom Bradley and union leader Cesar Chavez, originally was planned for 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
It was postponed after Olivares fell ill and was diagnosed with AIDS. His 
doctors said he apparently contracted the disease from contaminated syringes 
while undergoing treatment for other maladies during his travels to Central 
America. Representatives of Los Angeles' religious, political and entertainment 
communities will host the event at Olvera Street Plaza near downtown as a 
tribute to Olivares and his work, said Linda Mitchell of United Way and one of 
the event's organizers. She added that the city of Los Angeles will declare 
Sept. 5 Father Olivares Day.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GANG MEMBER PLEADS GUILTY IN TEEN'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of three gang members who participated in the beating and fatal shooting of 
16-year-old Jimmie Torrez III pleaded guilty Friday to first-degree murder in 
the Aug. 27 slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The killing produced an outpouring of community concern over increased gang 
activity in San Fernando. A candlelight vigil attended by 300 was held in 
memory of Torrez, who was attacked after falling off his motorcycle while 
trying to escape the gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Martinez, 21, also pleaded guilty to a recently enacted state law that 
makes membership in a street gang a crime. It was one of the first such 
convictions in Los Angeles County, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
On July 3, an accomplice of Martinez's, Manuel Madrigal, 23, became the first 
defendant convicted by a Los Angeles County jury under the street gang law, 
which went into effect last year, Nison said. Madrigal also was convicted of 
first-degree murder in the killing of Torrez and faces 26 years to life in 
prison when he is sentenced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez faces 27 years to life in prison when he is sentenced Aug. 23, Nison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The third defendant in the killing, Robert Flores, 24, of Pacoima, pleaded 
guilty May 30 to voluntary manslaughter and is scheduled to be sentenced July 
27. He is expected to receive the maximum 12-year prison term, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez and Madrigal beat Torrez after the boy fell off a motorcycle they had 
been chasing on a San Fernando street, Nison said. But it was Martinez who 
retrieved a .22-caliber assault rifle from the trunk of his car moments after 
the beating and shot the wounded Torrez once in the head and five times in the 
chest, Nison said. Flores was with the other two but may not have participated 
in the killing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The men mistakenly thought Torrez had killed a member of a gang with which they 
were associated, police said.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA MAN GUILTY IN BOTCHED ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal jury found a Pomona man guilty of attempted bank robbery and 
kidnaping Friday for holding a bank manager and her husband in their Palmdale 
home for 36 hours, then trying unsuccessfully to rob the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone McCraw, 29, also was convicted of using a firearm during the February 
crime and faces from 15 years to life in prison as a result of the verdict in 
U.S. District Court, said Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
David Tennant. McCraw will be sentenced Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
McCraw's accomplice, 29-year-old Brian Simms, pleaded guilty to the same 
charges and testified against McCraw. Simms will be sentenced on Aug. 27; he 
faces 12 years in prison as the result of a plea-bargain agreement, Tennant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, described by Tennant as "inept and not very bright" would-be 
robbers, hatched the plot to kidnap the Newhall savings branch manager after 
working as carpet layers at the branch office. After holding the couple at 
gunpoint in the Palmdale house for more than a day, they left the husband bound 
and gagged and took the manager to the branch office, where she set off a 
silent alarm that summoned authorities.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL MAY EASE LAW ON KEEPING HORSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson introduced a motion Friday that would 
make it easier for small landowners to keep horses. 
</P>
<P>
Existing city law runs counter to the "city's policy of encouraging and 
preserving the horse-keeping lifestyle" by requiring corrals to be located at 
least 35 feet away from a habitable room, Bernson said. That makes 
"horse-keeping possible only on very large lots," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This needs to be changed immediately." 
</P>
<P>
The original intent of the setback requirement was to maintain a 35-foot 
distance between barns and stables and human habitation, according to the north 
San Fernando Valley councilman. 
</P>
<P>
His motion was referred to the council's Planning and Land Use Management 
Committee, which he chairs.

Searchers found the wreckage of a missing Israeli air force plane on the 
western slopes of the Golan Heights, near the Syrian border, along with the 
body of the reservist captain who stole the craft, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery ended a massive search, launched a week ago after the twin-engine 
Dornier 28 was stolen from an air base in central Israel by Hagai Morry, 33. 
There had been speculation that Morry might have defected to a neighboring Arab 
country. But Maj. Gen. Avihu Ben-Nun, the air force commander, said he believes 
that Morry intended to commit suicide by crashing his plane. Officials said 
earlier they believed Morry had personal problems.

Armenian nationalist gunmen took a Soviet guard detachment hostage after a

the newly elected 259-seat Parliament in Yerevan interrupted proceedings to 
send a group to try to secure the release of the soldiers and the return of 
their weapons. Separately, an explosion apparently set off by an Azerbaijani 
militant killed four people and wounded 10 on a passenger train near the Black

The policemen had surrendered to rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
last month after the guerrillas rejected a 13-monthlong cease-fire with 
government forces. The officers had been shot a single time in the head, the 
statement said. Meantime, a senior police official said that 45 policemen 
escaped from rebel captivity Tuesday after killing three guerrillas. The report 
came as fighting continued in northern Sri Lanka, where security forces killed 
at least 18 Tamil rebels.

TUMOR-STRICKEN ATWATER NAMES A GOP 'DESIGNATED SPOKESMAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater on Friday named veteran GOP political 
consultant Charles Black to serve as his "designated spokesman" while Atwater 
continues his struggle against a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first official recognition by party officials of a problem that many 
Republicans have discussed privately -- that the GOP has been handicapped by 
Atwater's prolonged absence. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made as President Bush, whose 1988 campaign was managed by 
Atwater, is being buffeted by the two most serious political storms of his 
White House tenure -- the breaking of his pledge not to raise taxes and the 
escalating cost of the savings and loans scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans have speculated that, had Atwater been active, he would have 
devised a more graceful way for the President to explain his recent shift on 
tax policy and would have been more aggressive in responding to Democratic 
criticism on the savings and loan issue. 
</P>
<P>
Black's appointment was made a week after the semiannual meeting of the 
Republican National Committee in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement announcing the appointment, Atwater praised the national 
committee staff for its performance during the Chicago meeting, saying that it 
had "demonstrated leadership aimed at supporting our President and our party 
and getting the facts out to the American people through strong spokesmen." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Atwater said the meeting "made clear to me the need to have the 
strongest possible spokesmen available to carry our message to the public on a 
day-to-day basis." 
</P>
<P>
After describing Black "as my best friend and political eyes and ears," Atwater 
said: "I've now asked him also to be my mouthpiece, and Charles has unselfishly 
accepted." 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Black, like Atwater, has strong ties to Republican 
conservatives.

A measure banning abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to save a

the Oregon secretary of state's office said in Salem.

A citizens' group collected 101,963 signatures to put the proposed 
constitutional amendment on the ballot. Also to be voted on is a proposal to 
change state statutes to require doctors to notify at least one parent before 
performing an abortion on a minor. Oregon decriminalized abortions in 1969.

<P>
A $700,000 award against two newspapers that broke a promise of confidentiality 
to a political campaign worker has been overturned by the Minnesota Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
The court also held that enforcing a promise of confidentiality under a 
doctrine that implies a legal contract where none exists would violate the 
First Amendment rights of the Saint Paul Pioneer Press and the Star Tribune of 
Minneapolis. The decision on a 4-2 vote overturned a jury verdict in favor of 
Dan Cohen, who said he will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Cohen sued the 
newspapers for stories in 1982 identifying him as the source of documents 
showing the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor was convicted of 
shoplifting 12 years earlier.

A group of Bay Area Vietnamese fishermen asked a panel of federal judges Friday 
to bar enforcement of a 200-year-old law that prevents them from earning a 
living. In oral arguments before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 
attorneys challenged the use of the 1789 Jones Act to prevent resident aliens 
legally living and working in the United States from doing many kinds of 
commercial fishing. The law bars non-U.S. citizens from owning or captaining 
boats of more than five net tons or more than about 35 feet long.

THE FOCAL POINT OF FURY DURING WATTS RIOTS IS NOW HUB OF HOPE

This is Charcoal Alley. 
</P>
<P>
Near the middle of this stretch of 103rd Street between Success Avenue and 
Grape Street, barber Robert F. Blue settles into a chair along a wall of the 
otherwise empty Style Rite Barber Shop, patiently waiting to dispense the day's 
portion of shaves and jheri curls and high-top fades. 
</P>
<P>
A few doors east, Bobby Griffin peers down from the stool behind the counter of 
his chicken shop and informs a small girl that his business is shuttered for 
the day, that her mom can pick up a tender fryer as soon as he and some workmen 
repair a busted back window. 
</P>
<P>
Several yards from the corner of Anzac Avenue, Melvin Hill and Roy Allen hunch 
over the front of Hill's older-model pickup truck, tinkering to no avail with 
metal innards that have been on the blink all day. 
</P>
<P>
All along the street, a dull serenity pervades the midday heat. It is a calm 
familiar to most communities, one rooted in routine and summer dog days. 
</P>
<P>
But here, it is also rooted in chaos. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when this place looked like a war zone," says Allen, straightening 
up and stepping around to the side of the pickup truck. "They burned 
everything. Everything had to go." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, this strip of 103rd Street became a focal point for 
black fury as angry Watts residents sacked and torched the area during the 1965 
riots. Stores were gutted, their goods strewn throughout the street. With the 
debris lay the bloody bodies of people shot down by snipers and law enforcement 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every building from Success Avenue to Grape Street was reduced to 
rubble. So great was the charred damage that the strip was dubbed Charcoal 
Alley. 
</P>
<P>
But 25 years have brought immense change to this portion of 103rd Street. The 
target of a development boom after the riots, Charcoal Alley has become a hub 
of hope for the troubled district. 
</P>
<P>
Immaculate low-income housing complexes, community centers and office buildings 
have risen from the ashes of the burned storefronts. A massive shopping center 
named after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. sits at the corner of 103rd Street and 
Compton Avenue, ringed with Burger Kings, Sav-On drug stores and other 
commercial newcomers to Watts. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from the shopping center is the Watts Health Center, the sole 
medical facility in Watts proper. A U.S. Post Office is located just up the 
street, a few blocks away from the new Metro Rail Blue Line platform. 
</P>
<P>
The city-run Community Redevelopment Agency, which designated the strip of 
103rd Street one of its development project areas after the riots, is 
responsible for much of the improvement, with help from several community 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA has since begun making preparations to vastly expand the boundaries of 
the project -- creating the city's largest redevelopment zone. The plan has 
drawn criticism from some residents who fear it will make the community so 
commercially attractive that they will be forced out. 
</P>
<P>
CRA critics also contend the development in the current redevelopment zone 
along 103rd has progressed slower than in other project areas throughout the 
city. But agency officials say they are committed to fully upgrading Charcoal 
Alley -- as well as all of Watts. 
</P>
<P>
"We wish we could do more," says William E. Brown, who supervises CRA 
development in the 107-acre Watts project area. "We don't want to tear the 
fabric of the community by building too much too fast. Still, that area has 
come a very long way." 
</P>
<P>
Many Watts residents agree. They note that the developments have provided more 
residents with sorely needed jobs, goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of good things really did come out of the riot," says Abbie Long, 73, 
who has lived in Watts since 1940. "There was nothing really around for us. 
Black folks now have a better chance of getting a job in the shopping center or 
something. What could you do before? Shine shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the new developments, however, many older Watts residents find 
themselves occasionally pining for the Watts of old. 
</P>
<P>
"All up and down here," says Hill, "there were a bunch of little 
storefront-type shops. We had all kinds of things here. There were a lot of 
problems around here, but this was our community. We still loved it." 
</P>
<P>
Near the corner of Wilmington, he recalls, sat Nat Diamond's furniture 
emporium, where most of the people in the neighborhood went for sofas, lamps 
and area rugs. Then there was the Largo Theater, a second home to the children 
who would pack its rows to catch the early showings of "Frankenstein" and 
Abbott and Costello. 
</P>
<P>
Shoe stores, hardware outlets, pharmacies, five-and-dime stores -- they were 
all there. 
</P>
<P>
"And they all had to go," says Hill. 
</P>
<P>
On the third day of the rioting, they went. Stirred up by reports that blacks 
on the outskirts of Watts were looting and burning stores, residents within the 
district lashed out at their own neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A grocery store on Compton Avenue and 103rd Street was the first to be hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember seeing mobs, about 15 or 20 in a mob, just running down the street 
with food and other stuff from the grocery store," says Blue, the barber. "At 
first, it was just the grocery store on fire. That's where it started. Then it 
just kept going in this direction." 
</P>
<P>
Blue says Style Rite was spared because its owner is black. Few black-owned 
businesses were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the anger waned, and the rioting passed. Many of the old shop 
owners moved their businesses out of the area, opting to relocate rather than 
rebuild. The remnants of their shops were razed, and soon rebuilding began. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years later, many along Charcoal Alley believe the area has at last 
shed its legacy of violence and despair. Even the strip's nickname is fading 
into faint memory. For many, the infamous Charcoal Alley is now just plain 
103rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Charcoal Alley?" queries Bobby Griffin, perplexed by even the mention of the 
name. "That's not what people in Watts call this place, at least not now. They 
may have during the riots, but I have never heard anybody use that. This is 
just our community." 
</P>
<P>
This is Charcoal Alley.

6 CHARGED WITH LINK TO DRUG MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five Los Angeles-area men were charged Friday with laundering at least $68 
million in illicit drug money through the downtown jewelry district and local 
banks as part of an international narcotics ring. 
</P>
<P>
A sixth man, who is an Argentine citizen, was charged with playing a key role 
in the scheme but authorities would not disclose whether he has been taken into 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents filed in federal court in Los Angeles, the men were 
involved in laundering close to $250 million, but $180 million of that is the 
subject of another criminal case filed last year. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's arrests stemmed from a lengthy, multi-agency money laundering 
investigation called "Polar Cap." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark J. Werksman, the lead prosecutor in the case, said 
that more information on the scope of the laundering operation would be 
forthcoming. "The numbers are stratospheric," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The original "Polar Cap" arrests were made in Los Angeles in February, 1989, 
when federal agents swept through the downtown jewelry district and arrested 31 
people, charging them with operating perhaps the most elaborate money 
laundering scheme ever uncovered in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of those people are currently on trial in federal court, charged with 
laundering about $350 million in drug proceeds through a downtown jewelry 
company called Andonian Bros., headquartered at 220 W. 5th St. 
</P>
<P>
Trial is pending for 12 others charged with laundering $312 million through 
another downtown jewelry called Ropex Corp., which was headquartered at 550 S. 
Hill St. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, several of the individuals arrested last year have pleaded guilty 
to money laundering and are now cooperating with federal investigators. An 
affidavit filed by FBI agent Bruce Stephens, in connection with Friday's 
arrests, reveals that those persons have provided considerable information to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
Documents filed Friday state that the defendants in the new case were 
co-conspirators with the owners of Ropex Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, prepared by prosecutor Werksman, states that during the past 
four years people in the ring collected cartons of drug money packed like 
bricks and shipped by armored car from narcotics dealers in Los Angeles, New 
York City and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Once the money arrived in Los Angeles, the defendants counted cocaine proceeds 
utilizing high-speed money-counting machines, and repacked the currency into 
boxes, catalogue cases and other packages. The defendants then hand-carried or 
used armored cars to transport the money to local banks. 
</P>
<P>
After the money was deposited, the defendants had it wired to bank accounts in 
New York City, Panama, Uruguay and other places, in an attempt to "conceal the 
nature, source, location and ownership of the cocaine proceeds, and to place 
the proceeds outside the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"Unknown co-conspirators located in Colombia, in turn, utilized these narcotics 
proceeds to pay the expenses of the narcotics enterprise, and to finance 
additional large shipments of cocaine to be imported into the United States," 
according to the complaint filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday and Friday, federal agents arrested Sarkis P. Tanijian, 32, of 
Northridge, Vartkes Jirair Agop Magarian, 56, of Van Nuys and Coroun M. 
Arslanian, 53, of Glendale. Also arrested were Jean J. Mahroukian, 41, and 
George Atik, 41, whose addresses were not available. Werksman said all the men 
were arrested in Los Angeles County and defense lawyers said some of them had 
been arrested at their offices in the downtown jewelry district. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged but not present in court Friday was Celio Merkin, 57, an Argentine 
citizen, whose family lives in Montevideo, Uruguay. Werksman would not say if 
Merkin was in custody there. 
</P>
<P>
However, Errol H. Stambler, a lawyer for one of the cooperating defendants, 
Sergio Hochman, said he thought it was highly likely that Merkin had been 
arrested in Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way the government would have released this complaint against 
Merkin unless they had him in custody," Stambler said. The complaint originally 
was filed, under seal, in March. 
</P>
<P>
Stambler said he thought that the U.S. government would attempt to have Merkin 
extradited from Uruguay, the same procedure used to bring defendant Raul Vivas, 
also an Argentinian captured in Uruguay, to this country last December. 
</P>
<P>
The six men named Friday are accused of money laundering and of aiding and 
abetting others in the distribution of cocaine. They face long prison terms if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The documents allege that Astro Jewelers, located at 610 S. Broadway and 
operated by Mahroukian and his brother, Albert Mahroukian, laundered $28 
million between 1987 and February, 1989. The documents also allege that 
Universal Gold Exchange, located at 650 S. Hill and owned by Atik, laundered 
$32 million between 1987 and February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Atik laundered another $8.8 million between April and July 13 of 
this year, according to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens' affidavit also describes wiretaps and video surveillance of the 
defendants, lists huge numbers of bank transactions and includes a description 
of information provided by the individuals who pleaded guilty in the other 
money laundering cases that stemmed from the same investigation. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Hochman, a Uruguyan, told FBI agents that he, Merkin and Vivas, 
who is a defendant in the $350-million money laundering case now on trial, 
first met in Uruguay to discuss the money laundering business in April, 1986. 
Hochman said that he opened Cambio Italia, a money exchange business in 
Montevideo with money put up by Merkin and Jorge Masihy, a Chilean. 
</P>
<P>
Hochman said he came to Los Angeles in July, 1986, at Vivas' request to work on 
money collection and transport. He told the FBI that in 1988 Merkin broke off 
from Vivas and started his own money laundering enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Manouk Demirjian, who owned a wholesale jewelry business in Los Angeles, and 
participated in the money laundering scheme for three years, is also 
cooperating with the government, after pleading guilty. So are Peter (Pepe) 
Fuentes, who was one of the coordinators of drug money collection in New York, 
Los Angeles and Miami, and Eduardo Ortiz, one of Merkin's money couriers, 
according to Stephens' affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz told FBI agent Bryan Tepper that he delivered money to Ropex and Astro 
Jewelers in late 1988. Ortiz also said that during the month of January, 1989, 
he made more than 15 deliveries of currency to Tanijian's residence in 
Northridge.

JUDGE SAYS GIRL, 7, WAS RAPED, LIFTS LICENSE OF FOSTER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST and SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The foster home license of a Whittier couple has been revoked by an 
administrative law judge who ruled that the foster father had sexual 
intercourse with a 7-year-old girl in the home and that the foster mother was 
aware of the molestation, the state Department of Social Services said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The case of the Steve and Becky Brown foster home, which was closed this 
spring, is one more symptom of the troubles in Los Angeles County's children's 
services system, according to Lawrence Bolton, assistant chief counsel with the 
state agency. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges have been filed against the Browns and the couple insist 
that they are innocent. Becky Brown refused to comment Thursday on the 
revocation of the couple's license. 
</P>
<P>
The announced ruling in the Brown case followed Thursday's resignation of 
Robert L. Chaffee, director of the Los Angeles County Department for Children's 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee stepped down from his post amid mounting criticism of his agency, 
pressure from the County Board of Supervisors and disclosures that top 
department officials ignored warnings of their investigators about the alleged 
physical and sexual abuse of foster children. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton said that in the Brown case, Children's Services officials delayed an 
investigation into a molestation complaint for two months last spring before he 
prevailed on them to look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
However, Children's Services workers involved in the investigation maintained 
that the case was handled properly. 
</P>
<P>
Four sisters had been removed from the Brown home in February, 1989, after 
medical examinations indicated that three of them had been sexually molested. 
Both the Browns and the family of the children were suspected, but no one was 
charged and the Browns continued to operate their foster home. 
</P>
<P>
Social worker Deborah Laurita, who has since resigned from the department, said 
she became convinced that one of the children, then 7, implicated Steve Brown, 
but that Children's Services officials refused to conduct a further 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Laurita noted in her departmental log on April 24, 1989, that her request for 
an investigation into the youngster's allegation of abuse was refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I called Marcia Trowbridge (a supervisor in the foster home investigative 
unit)," wrote Laurita, "and explained the allegations about the molest and Ms. 
Trowbridge told me that this case goes so high up that she would not 
investigate. I argued that the allegations were pretty serious since there were 
still two kids there (in the Brown home), but she still refused to 
investigate." 
</P>
<P>
Trowbridge on Friday denied making such comments to Laurita. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not say that to her," Trowbridge told The Times. "We investigated that 
case very thoroughly." Another source familiar with the investigation also said 
the case was handled properly and there was no interference from superiors. 
</P>
<P>
When the investigation ordered by Bolton was finally conducted, officials said 
they found no justification for closing the Browns' home. But county social 
workers continued to be suspicious of Steve Brown and recommended that the 
sisters who were removed from the home last year be placed with their 
relatives. Over the objections of social workers, however, a juvenile court 
judge made the Browns guardians of one of the girls, a 3-year-old. That child 
has been removed from the couple's home but the Browns are seeking to regain 
guardianship. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns' foster home was closed this spring based on medical evidence and 
new statements by the 7-year-old sister, who is now 8. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns agreed to give up their foster care license but state officials say 
the agreement was never signed. At that point, the state asked an 
administrative law judge to revoke the license and a hearing was held earlier 
this month. The Browns did not attend or refute the evidence of molestation 
that was presented. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee was not accepting news media calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his resignation -- although lauded by child advocates who have been 
saying for weeks that a change of leadership was needed -- has left the 
department under a cloud of uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
There are questions about whether other top officials may resign, whether an 
interim director can be brought in quickly or if Chaffee will remain through 
the fall, and what effect the shake-up will have on the state's attempt to take 
over the county's $457-million child welfare services system. The supervisors 
are expected to discuss these issues Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At least one supervisor, Mike Antonovich, has called for a "top to bottom" 
reorganization of the agency, including the removal of Chaffee's "top 
lieutenants." On Friday, children's services workers said they were wondering 
who will be next to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are very up in the air," said Patti Kamoto, a licensing worker in the 
department. "Maybe people sensed it was coming for the last few months but I 
think that people are wondering who else is going to be involved in this and 
what's really going to happen from here on out." 
</P>
<P>
"People are basically relieved," said Penny Steinberg, a supervising social 
worker in the agency's West Los Angeles office. She said workers were 
"demoralized" and had lost faith in their superiors. 
</P>
<P>
While Chaffee has pledged to stay until Oct. 31, Supervisor Ed Edelman intends 
to press for an immediate replacement. If Chaffee's deputies also resign, that 
could leave the department without an experienced in-house manager to replace 
him until a successor is found.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY POSTPONES ACTION TO ALLOW DOGS ON 9-MILE TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Parks and Harbor Commission has postponed until Sept. 15 the 
issue of whether dogs should be allowed on the Ojai Valley Trail. 
</P>
<P>
The panel was to consider a county Parks Department recommendation that dogs be 
allowed if they are on a leash and their owners carry "pooper scoopers" to keep 
the popular, nine-mile bike and bridle pathway clean. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, however, the County Board of Supervisors has adopted a new law 
that requires pet owners after Aug. 9 to carry a bag or device to remove their 
pet's droppings if they walk their animals on any county property or public 
school ground. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Jenks, director of the county's Animal Regulation Department, said that 
she proposed the law primarily to control droppings at schools and beaches, but 
that it applies to county parks such as the Ojai Valley Trail. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the only issue left is whether dogs will be allowed in this park," Parks 
Manager Andy Oshita said. 
</P>
<P>
The trail that snakes through Ojai Valley along California 33 is the county's 
longest, narrowest park. 
</P>
<P>
It was funded largely by state money earmarked for highway bicycle lanes. 
County officials were able to use the funds to develop the trail, which runs 
along a former railroad line into Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
When the trail was completed last year, signs were posted to prohibit dogs and 
motorized vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Area residents told the commission in June that they intended to keep walking 
their dogs along the trail as they had done for years before it was paved. 
</P>
<P>
Although some bicyclists have demanded that no dogs be allowed, the Parks 
Department has received dozens of phone calls and letters indicating 90% of the 
trail-users favor allowing dogs as long as they are on a leash, Oshita said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WHITE, BLACK, LATINO ENROLLMENT DOWN AT 
UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA is searching for causes for the decline in the number of white, black and 
Latino applicants for this year's freshman class, Chancellor Charles E. Young 
told UC Regents Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Because of those drops, about a third of the class at the Westwood campus is 
expected to be whites, down from nearly 42% last year; blacks are expected to 
account for 7%, down from 8.6% in 1989, and Latinos 18%, compared to 19% last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of the freshmen are expected to be Asian, up from about 26% last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that some applicants may have been scared off by increasingly tough 
competition and others by financial difficulties. A committee of faculty, 
students and administrators is expected to issue a report on the admissions 
changes by September, Young said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RELATIVES GAIN CONTROL OF DEAD ACTOR'S 
ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Relatives of David Rappaport, the dwarf "L.A. Law" actor who committed suicide 
in May, have gained control of his estate from Los Angeles County officials. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court commissioner Friday selected Frankie Leigh, the star's cousin 
and manager, to serve as general administrator of the estate. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh had presented letters to the court signed by Rappaport's son and heir, 
Joseph, the boy's mother and other relatives who backed her appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the county public administrator's office had asserted jurisdiction 
over the British Rappaport's U.S. possessions, which primarily consist of a 
house in the Hollywood Hills, a car, clothing and a checking account. 
Representatives of the county had begun eviction proceedings against 
Rappaport's fiancee, Eliza Lende, and had attempted to take possession of his 
car and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Kent of the public administrator's office said the county was trying to 
protect the interests of the actor's son.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PHILIPPINE QUAKE RELIEF FUND IS ESTABLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A relief fund for earthquake victims has been established by the Los Angeles 
office of the Philippine consulate general after Monday's devastating quake and 
aftershocks that killed nearly 700 people and injured more than 2,600 others in 
the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Consul General Victor G. Garcia III said his nation is gratified by the 
outpouring of sympathy and help from Americans, including many in Los Angeles' 
Filipino community. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to financial assistance, however, he said the Philippine government 
is still seeking medical supplies and rescue equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said the consulate general has established a Philippine earthquake 
relief fund at 3460 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1200, Los Angeles, 90010. The fund

JUDGE TURNS DOWN REQUEST TO SUSPEND COUNTY DRUG TESTS; 
</P>
<P>
WORKER RIGHTS: APPLICANTS FOR SENSITIVE AND SAFETY-RELATED JOBS MAY STILL BE 
TESTED. UNIONS HAD ASKED FOR INJUNCTION TO HALT NEW PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County employees were legally thwarted Friday in their attempts to 
temporarily stop the county's newly initiated program to test some job 
applicants for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of unions representing 30,000 workers was denied a preliminary 
injunction by Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffee, who ruled that under state 
law the county had the right to test job applicants who are applying for 
sensitive and safety-related positions. 
</P>
<P>
"If the county wants to make darn sure that they don't hire a drug user for a 
sensitive position, they can do it," Yaffee said. 
</P>
<P>
He ruled that the county could implement the program without negotiating with 
the union because it is not directed against present county employees. 
</P>
<P>
The new program, initiated by county officials July 2, requires applicants for 
certain county jobs to submit to drug testing. Among jobs covered by the new 
guidelines are public safety positions, such as sheriff's deputies, lifeguards 
and firefighters; driver positions, such as chauffeurs and trash truck 
operators, and positions that involve significant financial responsibilities, 
such as accountants. 
</P>
<P>
County employees who apply for transfers to such jobs are subject to the 
testing, as well as applicants from outside the county ranks. So far, county 
officials said, only sheriff's deputy trainees have been tested. 
</P>
<P>
The unions sought the preliminary injunction to stop the program until the 
County Employee Relations Commission can hear their complaint of unfair 
employee relations practices, which was sparked by the county's failure to 
bargain with the unions before implementing the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"The unions don't condone drug use, but we feel the program should not have 
been implemented without union bargaining," said Alexander Cvitan, attorney for 
the workers' coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right of employers to demand drug tests 
for employment applicants or personnel who have been involved in on-the-job 
accidents and for those who take periodic physical exams as a condition of 
employment. But attorneys who represent labor unions believe that the court has 
yet to rule definitively whether purely random tests are constitutional or if 
they violate the 4th Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the California Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that 
employers cannot fire or otherwise punish workers who refuse to submit to 
random drug tests. The ruling was based on California's constitutional privacy 
protections. 
</P>
<P>
The county, however, has not implemented random testing. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, the Southern California Rapid Transit District last year began 
administering random drug tests to its 7,000 drivers and mechanics, and the Los 
Angeles Police Department ordered mandatory random drug testing of its 
captains, commanders and deputy chiefs beginning May 1. Those who test positive 
for illegal drugs face being fired. 
</P>
<P>
A program that would require 6,000 other city police to be tested randomly once 
a year is under negotiation with the police union.

BUCKEY JURY REACHES A VERDICT ON 1 OF 8 COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly two weeks of deliberations, the jury in the retrial of McMartin 
Pre-School molestation defendant Ray Buckey returned its first verdict Friday 
in a sealed envelope. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict will remain sealed while the jury decides the other seven counts. 
Jury members left for the weekend at 4 p.m. Friday, and will resume 
deliberations at 9 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Just before noon Friday, the jury foreman pressed a buzzer in the jury room 
three times, a signal to the court clerk that the panel had reached its first 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after the verdict was delivered, Buckey told reporters that "it's 
almost like waiting (to find out) if you're going to get the electric chair or 
if they're going to let you go." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of wondering if 12 people can see the truth that you've known 
for seven years and you've been banging your head against the wall, trying to 
convince everybody else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case went to the seven-woman, five-man panel July 9 after a three-month 
trial. Jurors have examined numerous exhibits and listened to extensive 
rereading of testimony, but have given no indication that they have had any 
disagreements or problems with the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Buckey is no longer required to remain in the downtown criminal 
courts building while his fate is being decided. This week, the 32-year-old 
former nursery school teacher has been checking in with the court three times a 
day. Lawyers for both sides must be available within 45 minutes of a call from 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is debating Buckey's guilt or innocence on eight counts unresolved by 
an earlier jury. Buckey was acquitted of 40 counts last January, but that jury 
deadlocked on 13 counts. Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner decided to retry Buckey on 
eight of them -- before a new judge, with a new prosecution team, and adding a 
new child witness. Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, was acquitted in 
January of 12 counts of molestation, while a 13th count, alleging conspiracy, 
was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Three young girls and their parents testified against Buckey, and a 
pediatrician who examined the children told jurors she had found physical signs 
of molestation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Buckey took the witness stand and denied the allegations. A coroner 
flown in from London by the defense testified that the scars and other physical 
signs noted by the examining physician are not indicative of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
During their 10 days of deliberations, the jurors have watched several hours of 
videotaped interviews with the alleged child victims again. They have asked for 
clarification of terms such as penetration and fondling. 
</P>
<P>
They have asked that testimony by the pediatrician, Dr. Astrid Heger, regarding 
concern expressed by one child about her eyes, be reread. The girl indicated 
that semen had gotten in her eyes during sex acts by Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two days this past week, jurors listened to a rereading of the 
entire testimony of Dr. David Paul, medical examiner for the city of London, 
who took issue with Heger's findings. He said the girls showed no signs of 
having been raped or sodomized. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Buckey faces a maximum sentence of 22 years. He has already spent 
five years in county jail and is now free on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant said he is worn out. 
</P>
<P>
"By this point in time, everyone's taken their position," Buckey explained. "I 
don't care anymore. I just want to get out of this; I'm tired of it."

GREYHOUND DOG RESEARCH AT UCLA ATTACKED, BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A national animal rights group, which succeeded in stopping animal experiments 
at two Northern California research centers, is claiming that UCLA is among 
institutions in California and Arizona that obtained hundreds of greyhound dogs 
that were not supposed to be used for research. 
</P>
<P>
In Defense of Animals maintains in a lawsuit that the dogs had been obtained 
fraudulently and either sold or given to UCLA and the other institutions for 
use in animal experiments even though the dogs' former owners had not given 
their consent. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA officials insist they obtained the dogs legitimately and deny any 
wrongdoing. Their statements are bolstered by an Arizona veterinarian who has 
examined greyhound dogs headed for research centers -- including those at UCLA 
-- and insists the controversy is all the result of a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Yocham, a Phoenix-based veterinarian, said each year thousands of 
greyhound dogs no longer able to compete in racing are abandoned by their 
owners. No one seems to know exactly how many dogs end their racing careers 
each year. But a spokeswoman for a national greyhound registry said it newly 
registers about 47,000 greyhounds each year. 
</P>
<P>
Yocham said owners often tell the trainers either to find a home for the 
retired dogs as pets, or to humanely destroy them because they no longer want 
the expense of maintaining them. 
</P>
<P>
Finding homes for the dogs frequently proves difficult, he said, so trainers 
often choose to sell or donate them to research rather than have them 
destroyed. Yocham acknowledged that in many cases the owner's have not directly 
consented to allowing their dogs to be used for research. But neither have they 
specifically requested that they not be used for that purpose, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Communication between owners and trainers has never been that tight," Yocham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers use a variety of animals for their experiments. But they 
particularly favor greyhounds because their bone structure is similar to that 
of humans, they are readily available and their breeding makes them docile. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the San Rafael-based animal rights organization said her 
group has found many former owners who have objected to their dogs being used 
for research. The group successfully stopped experiments on greyhounds at 
Letterman General Hospital at the Presidio in San Francisco last fall and at UC 
Davis earlier this year. In both of those cases, the organization discovered 
that the dogs had been purchased from an Arizona vendor named Gregory Ludlow, 
who voluntarily surrendered his license to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The group was able to trace many of the original owners of the dogs through 
numbers tattooed on the dogs' ears. In nearly all of the cases, the owners said 
they had no knowledge that their dogs had been turned over for research, said 
Susan Netboy, director of In Defense of Animal's Greyhound Rescue Project. 
</P>
<P>
On July 10, the group filed suit against Harrington Arthritis Research Center 
in Phoenix, alleging that the center also had obtained stolen dogs from Ludlow. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Ashoff Johnson, a spokeswoman for Harrington, said the center has agreed 
to halt the research until an independent inspection of the animals is 
completed. The center's own investigation, however, resulted in the release of 
only two of about 70 dogs in question. Johnson said they believe the remaining 
animals have been legally obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Ludlow could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The experiments being done on the greyhounds are legal and all the research 
facilities have abided by federal regulations by obtaining the dogs through 
licensed vendors, the animal rights group acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA experiments in question involve four greyhounds being used to test 
artificial hip implants. 
</P>
<P>
The research, according to a spokesman, involves surgically implanting the 
artificial hips under general anesthesia and monitoring the dogs for six to 18 
months, with periodic X-rays to evaluate how the bone is growing into the 
implants. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the monitoring period, the dogs are "euthanized," and the hips 
are analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a Santa Monica Superior Court Judge refused to issue a 
temporary restraining order to stop the research. Judge Irving Shimer, however, 
set a hearing for July 25 to determine if any of four dogs were donated without 
the owners' consent. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs were scheduled to be killed next week, but officials have agreed to 
delay any further action until after the court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Simon, a UCLA attorney, said two of the dogs were obtained from a licensed 
vendor and two others were donated by Yocham. She said she has documents 
proving the dogs were legally obtained, two of them from a dealer in Oregon. In 
the case of the dogs donated by Yocham, Simon said the owners had specifically 
consented to their use in the research project. 
</P>
<P>
According to Netboy of the rights group, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center purchased 
greyhounds from Ludlow in fall, 1988, and killed them three weeks later as part 
of a biomedical research project. Netboy said she spoke with owners of seven of 
the 20 dogs obtained by the medical centers and said that none had given 
permission for their dogs to be sold for research. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego also purchased two dogs from Ludlow in June, 1989. One of the dogs 
was killed a month later, the second was killed in August, according to Netboy. 
She said the original owners of those dogs were traced and neither had known 
the dogs were sold for research. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at both Cedars-Sinai and UC San Diego have said the dogs were 
obtained legally. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of the National Greyhound Assn. in Abilene, Kan., which 
operates a greyhound registry and certifies the dogs for racing, is notifying 
dog owners nationwide of the problem in an effort to clear up any 
misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Sanders, a member of the association's board, said owners generally do 
not follow up on what happens to their dogs after their racing careers are 
over. She said she is pushing for owners to obtain a written statement from 
trainers about how their dogs have been used. 
</P>
<P>
She disputes that it is difficult to place greyhounds as pets. She said more 
than 5,500 former racing greyhounds are annually placed in homes by a greyhound 
pet group.

Margaret Court says Martina Navratilova is a poor role model for young tennis 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ms. Court professes to be a born-again Christian, she seems to have 
forgotten Matthew 7:1: "Judge not, that ye be not judged." Martina has 
displayed skill, determination and grace over the years. What more could be 
asked of a role model for young athletes?

At tennis matches, I've seen a lot of tennis, but I've never seen a performance 
of sex. Unlike Margaret Court, I wasn't afraid to take my niece to see Martina 
(Navratilova) and Chris (Evert) play tennis, that her sexual identity would in 
any way be influenced. 
</P>
<P>
Admiring an athlete for his or her talent, determination and hard work makes 
sense. Expecting their personal lives to fit some unrealistic model is 
nonsense. Athletes' marriages, relationships, liaisons and divorces provide 
gossip and sell news, but they do not predict integrity, intelligence, 
personality or compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Court was a great tennis player, but her religious prejudices against 
Martina's sex life are not admirable. Clearly, the quality of Court's tennis 
did not determine the quality of her character.

Speaking of cheap shots, why does Mike Downey require a full column to slam 
Margaret Court's sense of values? In a society that tends to dismiss people 
with strong convictions as bigoted fanatics, I find Margaret Court's comments 
to be a rare expression of great courage, integrity and dignity that are the 
marks of a great champion. 
</P>
<P>
A cheap shot is when a nationally recognized sports columnist devotes an entire 
column to humiliate such an expression and to air his fears that the 
convictions of a past tennis champion will somehow threaten a person's right to 
choose his or her lifestyle orientation.

NOT IMPRESSED WITH BODY OF THEIR WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bodybuilding has its place, but it's not in the Olympics (July 14). Ben 
Weider's attempt to crowbar body exhibitions into the category of sport is more 
ludicrous than persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
Few would agree with Weider's claim that putting a good body on display is as 
worthy as swimming fast, but, agree or not, swimming, like every other Olympic 
event, is measured by performance, not show. The only element of performance in 
a body exhibition is the posing skill, which is secondary to the possession of 
a well-formed body. 
</P>
<P>
Body posing does not seriously test any of the qualities associated with 
athletic endeavor (speed, strength, timing, coordination, strategy). Let's not 
sully the concept of sport and the Olympic tradition by the admission of a 
beauty contest.

I was amazed that you dignified Margaret Court's homophobic remarks about 
Martina Navratilova by printing them as a news story. Would you publish such a 
story without editorial rebuttal if Court were commenting on race, ethnicity or 
religion? Martina has gained the respect of players and fans because she is so 
very talented, intense and disciplined. The fact that she is at ease in her 
personal life and is in a loving relationship is far from a "bad example for 
younger players" or anyone else.

TV PLAGIARISM CHARGE

<P>
Re "It May Not Be Plagiarism, but It's a Rip-Off," Howard Rosenberg's July 11 
column on KCAL Channel 9's unattributed use of the pictures and script of a CNN 
feature: Rosenberg quotes Channel 9's John Corcoran as saying he would be 
"highly offended to be called a plagiarist." Corcoran, if you're offended you 
should study that part of the definition of plagiarism that talks about putting 
your name on someone else's work. 
</P>
<P>
And shame on KCAL news director Bob Henry for calling it "a non-issue" because 
KCAL pays for CNN services. Perhaps Corcoran and Henry could explain how such a 
no-class position is any different from that of some airhead student who claims 
that he shouldn't get an F for buying a report from a term-paper mill and 
putting his own name on it as its author. Well, I guess if he did retype it 
himself. . . .

It seems clear to me that once CNN reporter Gloria Hillard's material hits the 
network, it's no longer personal property. 
</P>
<P>
Since CNN allows its affiliates to use material from the network without 
restriction, no ethical boundary has been crossed. It is not plagiarism to use 
somebody's material with his or her full consent. 
</P>
<P>
Hillard's indignation is something that should be worked out privately with her

NORTH VERDICTS VOIDED BY U.S. APPEALS COURT; 
</P>

IMMUNIZED TESTIMONY IS RESOLVED.

<P>
A U.S. appeals court Friday voided the three-count conviction of former White 
House aide Oliver L. North in the Iran-Contra scandal on grounds that his Fifth 
Amendment protection against self-incrimination may have been violated during 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
A divided three-judge panel threw out North's conviction on one count involving 
removal of sensitive documents from the White House as the scandal broke in 
November, 1986. It said the trial judge had given erroneous instructions to 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
On the two remaining counts of obstructing Congress and accepting an illegal 
gratuity, the panel set aside North's convictions pending a hearing by U.S. 
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on whether prosecutors made unfair use of 
North's immunized testimony before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruling is a major setback for independent counsel Lawrence E. 
Walsh, who is expected to appeal. Walsh is supervising a continuing 
investigation of the role of top Ronald Reagan Administration officials in the 
sale of U.S. arms to Iran and the diversion of profits to assist the Contras in 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
In a 2-1 decision, the appeals judges said that Gesell had erred in failing to 
hold a hearing prior to North's trial on the potentially damaging impact of 
North's nationally televised testimony before Congress in July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
North's lawyers had argued at the time that some members of Walsh's staff had 
been "tainted" by seeing or hearing some details of North's testimony despite a 
prohibition against using any of North's congressional testimony in his 
prosecution. They said some witnesses used by prosecutors had been similarly 
tainted. 
</P>
<P>
"The very purpose of the Fifth Amendment under these circumstances is to 
prevent the prosecutor" from becoming "the inquisitor, complete with that 
officer's most pernicious tool -- the power of the state to force a person to 
incriminate himself," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
For North, the immediate effect of the ruling is to remove the stigma of being 
a convicted felon. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has the option of appealing Friday's ruling to the full appellate court 
or directly to the Supreme Court. He said in a statement that he was studying 
"the most appropriate next step." He has 45 days to make his decision. 
</P>
<P>
North already has completed three-fourths of the 1,200 hours of community 
service that Gesell imposed as his punishment. He was also fined $150,000, but 
Gesell had stayed the payment pending a decision on North's appeal of his 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
North, in Baton Rouge, La., campaigning for a Republican Senate candidate, 
issued a statement through his attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., saying that 
he was "very grateful" for the court's action. 
</P>
<P>
"My family and I have been under virtual assault for more than 3 1/2 years in 
this extraordinary legal battle, and I hope that the independent counsel will 
end it now," North said. "I thank all those who have stood by us with their 
prayers and their support all these years." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling opens the door to eventual reinstatement of North's annual Marine 
pension of $23,100, which he lost on his conviction on May 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman said North would continue to be ineligible for pension 
benefits "until we have a chance to review the court of appeals decision." He 
said there was no obvious precedent on which to base a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The two appellate court judges who voted to overturn the conviction -- David 
Sentelle and Laurence H. Silberman -- were appointed by Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Judge Patricia Wald, an appointee of former President Jimmy Carter, 
dissented, saying: "I am convinced that the essentials of a fair trial were 
accorded North, and that his conviction on the three counts of which the jury 
found him guilty should be affirmed." 
</P>
<P>
Legal authorities said that the recent conviction of John M. Poindexter, who, 
as Reagan's national security adviser, was North's superior, is not likely to 
benefit directly from the court's ruling because a much fuller hearing on 
possibly tainted evidence was conducted before his trial. 
</P>
<P>
However, Richard W. Beckler, Poindexter's lawyer, said he was "very pleased" by 
the ruling because congressional immunity "is a very big issue in our appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, in his statement, said that "our other ongoing investigations will 
continue." He was referring to a federal grand jury that has heard testimony 
from both North and Poindexter, who appeared under grants of immunity. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the inquiry said the panel was examining the roles of 
several other former Reagan Administration officials in the Iran-Contra case. 
They include Elliott Abrams, former assistant secretary of state for Latin 
America; Donald P. Gregg, now U.S. ambassador to South Korea, who was Vice 
President George Bush's national security adviser, and Alan D. Fiers, who was 
chief of the CIA's Central American task force. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court, citing a possible unfair use of North's immunized 
testimony before Congress, said a 1972 Supreme Court decision prohibits federal 
prosecutors from making any use of such testimony against the criminal 
defendant who gave it. 
</P>
<P>
The court said that Gesell should have made a more searching inquiry before the 
trial when he learned that North's congressional testimony had served to 
refresh the memories of many witnesses who testified before the grand jury that 
indicted North in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Such use of North's congressional testimony appeared to violate his Fifth 
Amendment rights and should have received more than the "truncated" review 
provided by Gesell, the appellate court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
The judges said they understood Gesell's reluctance to hold what he called at 
the time "a trial before the trial" on the issue of North's immunized 
testimony. But they declared that "the convenience of the government" in saving 
time should not outweigh a defendant's rights to avoid self-incrimination.

ON STING TAPE, CARPENTER TELLS OF PUSHING BILL

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In secretly recorded conversations with an undercover FBI agent, then-state 
Sen. Paul B. Carpenter describes playing a crucial role in Senate passage of a 
1986 special-interest bill that was the centerpiece of a federal sting 
operation, according to transcripts obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
On the tapes, the onetime Democratic lawmaker from Norwalk talks of 
orchestrating the movement of the measure through the Senate, picking the state 
senator who carried the bill on the floor and prodding to get action before 
time ran out on the 1986 legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, who received $20,000 in campaign contributions from a phony company 
set up by the FBI for the sting, is scheduled to go on trial next month on 
federal extortion, racketeering and conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four counts against him are based on allegations that in return 
for payments he used his office to help the bogus company, which was seeking 
passage of a bill to secure financing for a shrimp-processing plant near 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Both state and federal laws prohibit lawmakers from accepting payments in 
exchange for official actions. A legislator may accept campaign contributions 
from private companies and individuals with an interest in legislation, as long 
as there is no understanding that the contribution is a payment for the 
lawmaker's action. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes, which are likely to be part of the evidence presented at Carpenter's 
trial, record the former senator describing an extensive, behind-the-scenes 
role in support of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes alone do not show that Carpenter acted in return for payment, but 
they do portray the undercover agent seeking Carpenter's assistance as an 
influential lawmaker -- and Carpenter responding. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, when the agent expressed concern that another senator's 
unexpected interest could impede passage of the shrimp bill, Carpenter 
reassured him, "Every time a little fire like that, ah, comes up, we try and 
stamp on it." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, now a member of the powerful State Board of Equalization, could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But Carpenter's press aide, Jerry Goldberg, said, "Never even once did 
Carpenter speak to a (Senate) member or to a staff person in support of the 
bill." But the same spokesman acknowledged that Carpenter had talked to the 
Assembly author of the bill and that Carpenter did speak with one senator, 
Leroy Greene (D-Sacramento), who presented the bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg also denied that Carpenter played any role in choosing Greene to carry 
the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But in conversations with undercover agent John E. Brennan II -- who pretended 
to be businessman Jack Gordon -- Carpenter often spoke of being an active 
participant, shepherding the bill along once it reached the Senate. As Gordon, 
Brennan was posing as president of Gulf Shrimp Fisheries Inc. of Mobile, Ala., 
which was seeking legislative help to finance a processing plant near 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In one conversation on Aug. 14, 1986, Brennan expressed concern about who would 
carry the measure when it reached the Senate floor for a vote, and Carpenter 
assured him that he would take care of it. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Brennan: "Ah, do you have an opinion yet on who'd be the best to manage 
it on the floor, take it up?" 
</P>
<P>
Replied Carpenter: "Ah, no, but ah, let me work on that this afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
On a later tape, after the bill passed the Senate, Carpenter told Brennan that 
Greene had given him "some concern" because he was slow to move the bill and 
was "hard to push." 
</P>
<P>
"He finally told me to get off his ass," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
But Greene said in an interview Friday that he had no recollection of a 
conversation "at any time . . . with Paul Carpenter or anything in connection 
with the 'shrimp-scam' measure." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter's attorney, Gerard J. Hinckley, said that the tapes are deceiving 
because his client was often responding out of politeness to Brennan's 
unrealistic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Carpenter doesn't want to say, 'Hey, you're full of crap,' " Hinckley said, 
when in fact the bill had virtually no opposition and was likely to pass easily 
without any intervention. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Carpenter has pointed out that he did not even vote for the 
measure, which was authored by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Hinckley said that the tapes should prove useful in convincing a jury of his 
client's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere in the transcripts of six meetings between Carpenter and the undercover 
agent did the lawmaker solicit payments or indicate that his support of the 
bill required contributions. 
</P>
<P>
And the tapes show that on Sept. 23, 1986, Carpenter pointedly refused to 
accept a campaign contribution from the undercover agent in the Capitol, which 
would be a direct violation of state law. "I can't take the check in the 
building," the lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
He also spurned a cashier's check, contending that the payment was tantamount 
to cash. Cash contributions of $100 or more are prohibited, but cashier's 
checks are permitted as long as the donor is clearly identified. 
</P>
<P>
After refusing to take a check in the Capitol, Carpenter accompanied Brennan to 
lunch at Frank Fat's, a popular bar and restaurant a few blocks from the 
Capitol. Both on the way and in the restaurant, Brennan continued his secret 
recording of their conversation, much of it idle chit-chat. 
</P>
<P>
After the meal, just before ordering a piece of banana cream pie, "Gordon" 
wrote out a check to Carpenter for $5,000 -- the last of three checks totaling 
$20,000 to the senator, who was then campaigning for a seat on the Board of 
Equalization, which administers business taxes in the state. Later, Carpenter 
reported the payments from the company to his campaign committee, as required 
under the California Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
But in an earlier conversation, on Aug. 11, 1986, Carpenter appeared to be 
receptive to a suggestion from the phony businessman that contributions be 
laundered through a cousin living in Los Angeles. Hiding a contribution by 
sending it through another party would have violated the state campaign 
reporting law. 
</P>
<P>
Said the FBI's Brennan: "Um, I'd like to make a contribution at a later date, 
but I'm gonna . . . if, just, so I don't get identified. Have that come through 
uh . . . a separate entity. Uh, I have a cousin from Los Angeles and I'll just, 
uh, if that's OK with you. Do it that way. So there's no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter: "Whatever uh . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Brennan: "Let you know this, that I'm . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter: "Sure." 
</P>
<P>
Hinckley said that Carpenter was again only replying politely and would never 
have gone along with such an arrangement, nor was such a contribution ever 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the same conversation, recorded on the street outside the Capitol, 
Carpenter told Brennan that the bill could run into difficulty if then-state 
Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh became aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Carpenter: "Our, our problem, I think, is gonna be with uh, Unruh . . . 
and we're gonna have to go over . . . and stroke him and . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Brennan responded by saying that he hoped the treasurer's office didn't 
represent "a great problem." 
</P>
<P>
But Carpenter assured him, "That, that's what I do. I solve problems." 
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent conversation, the two men discussed amendments that would have 
delayed the bill but, according to Carpenter, "would have made the, uh, 
treasurer a lot happier." 
</P>
<P>
But Carpenter offered the supposed businessman hope for passage without waiting 
for amendments. " . . . I get it off the floor and get it onto the governor's 
desk before, uh, Jesse Unruh knows what is happening," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the tapes, Brennan played to the hilt the part of the gregarious 
Southern businessman trying to win a special break to help finance the 
shrimp-processing plant, but constantly worrying about complications that would 
sink the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
On the day the bill reached the Senate, just before its first committee vote, 
Brennan expressed concern about problems from Senate Democrats and talked of 
having "to do something" for members of the Senate Democratic caucus. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter responded: "Well, I thought I would take care of that." Then he 
pointed out, "Uh, there are a number of different, uh, individuals that uh, uh, 
who are, have races that uh and . . . fortuitously sit on the committee." 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, after the bill has been unanimously approved by the Senate 
Banking and Commerce Committee, Brennan learned that Sen. Alan Robbins' office 
had made an inquiry about the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, that's something you're taking care of, isn't it?" Brennan asked 
Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
"Right," Carpenter assured him. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Robbins said he cannot recall inquiring about the 1986 
Gulf Shrimp bill. 
</P>
<P>
The Tarzana Democrat is himself a subject of the ongoing federal investigation 
of political corruption in the Capitol, according to several sources familiar 
with the probe. That investigation has already led to the conviction of former 
state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who recently began serving a 6 
1/2-year sentence at the federal prison camp near Boron. 
</P>
<P>
But Robbins has pointed out that, unlike Montoya and Carpenter, he took no 
payments from the undercover investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The Carpenter transcripts provide insights into the FBI sting operation as well 
as the inner workings of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
After the measure had been approved by both houses of the Legislature, Brennan 
told Carpenter that until he paid $1,000 to attend a lavish fund-raiser for 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), Gulf Shrimp had trouble 
getting its proposal before lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told I had to go to that," Brennan tells Carpenter on the tapes. "The 
next week a bill was found that I could use, so it worked out very well." 
</P>
<P>
A month after the Brown contribution, a previously introduced bill was stripped 
of its contents and Brennan's bill was put in its place. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's campaign committee reported receiving a check for $1,000 from Gulf 
Shrimp Fisheries Inc. for two tickets to his May 12, 1986, fund-raiser. Brown 
has never been identified as a subject of the federal sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
The sting bill received final legislative approval on Aug. 29, 1986, only to be 
vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, who had been tipped off by the FBI. A similar 
bill by Assemblywoman Moore won passage in 1988 and was also vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Former Sen. Paul Carpenter (D-Norwalk) is the second state elected official to 
be indicted as a result of an elaborate federal sting operation, in which 
undercover FBI agents posed as Southern businessmen seeking favors from the 
Legislature. The sting -- code-named BRISPEC (Bribery -- Special Interest) -- 
came to light in August, 1988, when about 30 federal agents armed with search 
warrants raided several offices in the state Capitol. Ex-Sen. Joseph B. Montoya 
(D-Whittier), who was caught up in the sting, has begun serving a 6 1/2-year 
prison sentence while appealing his conviction on seven counts of extortion, 
racketeering and money laundering. Sources familiar with BRISPEC say that 
indictments of other elected officials are likely after Carpenter's trial, 
scheduled to begin Aug. 13.

'A LITTLE FIRE' 
</P>
<P>
 This is an excerpt from a secretly recorded telephone conversation between 
undercover FBI Agent John E. Brennan II and then-Sen. Paul Carpenter on Aug. 
14, 1986. Brennan, posing as Alabama businessman Jack Gordon, is discussing the 
progress of a bill he is sponsoring and Carpenter is supporting. The bill was 
authored by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Brennan: Ah, I was down in, ah, Assemblywoman Moore's office and talking to her 
chief of staff and he indicated there has been an inquiry from Sen. (Alan) 
Robbins' office about my, maybe needing to do something there. Ah, that's 
something you're taking care of, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter: Right. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan: OK. I don't need to respond to that then. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter: Right. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan: Very good. Things are looking good, huh? 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter: So far so good. Every time a little fire like that, ah, comes up, we 
try and stamp on it.

With a heavily edited version of a key White House tape and museum displays 
that avoid many aspects of the scandal, including the criminal convictions of 
several senior aides, the new Richard M. Nixon library constitutes the former 
President's most recent effort in a 16-year campaign to reshape the public's 
view of Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
Library officials repeatedly had told reporters in recent days and weeks that 
the tapes presented at the museum would be left unedited. Asked Friday about 
that, library director Hugh Hewitt declined to comment. "That's a museum design 
question," he said, adding that the museum design had been supervised by 
Nixon's top aide and spokesman, John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Watergate display, which Nixon avoided when he gave President Bush and 
former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford a tour of the museum 
Thursday, opened to the public Friday. It consists of three White House tapes, 
two of which will not be available to visitors until September, and a long wall 
of text and photographs describing the events of the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The one tape available to the public now is the so-called "smoking gun" tape of 
July 23, 1972, in which Nixon approved a plan to have the CIA warn the FBI to 
stop its investigation of Watergate. The library version of the tape presents 
only some portions of the conversation, stitched together with a narration that 
offers innocent explanations for what Nixon is heard saying. The tape concludes 
with Nixon reading a diary entry made two weeks later describing later events. 
</P>
<P>
The text displays concede that "Nixon himself has said he made inexcusable 
misjudgments during Watergate" but accuse many of Nixon's critics -- ranging 
from the late Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.), who chaired the Senate's investigation 
of Watergate, to Archibald Cox, the Harvard law professor who served as special 
prosecutor until Nixon fired him -- of "partisan" bias. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and his former colleague Carl Bernstein 
are singled out for special criticism. One display accuses the two, who won a 
Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on Watergate, of "offering bribes, illegally 
gaining access to telephone numbers and talking to members of the grand jury" 
in their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The display puts that accusation in quotes attributed only to an unnamed 
"scholar." The quotation is from a recent book on Watergate by Stanley I. 
Kutler of the University of Wisconsin. Kutler, in an interview Friday, said 
that in the book he did not make the charge himself, but merely had noted that 
others had said it. Woodward, in an interview Friday, denied ever having 
offered bribes. 
</P>
<P>
As portrayed in thousands of pages of transcripts from court trials and 
congressional hearings, hundreds of hours of taped White House conversations 
and depositions from scores of witnesses, the scandal that became known as 
"Watergate" was, in fact, two overlapping conspiracies. 
</P>
<P>
The first, begun early in the Nixon term, was a plan to use wiretaps, 
burglaries and surveillance by the FBI, the CIA and independent groups 
organized by White House aides to harass, spy on and punish the President's 
enemies. Members of one of those independent groups, known informally as "the 
plumbers," were arrested on June 17, 1972, as they tried to break into the 
offices of Democratic National Chairman Lawrence O'Brien in Washington's 
Watergate office building. 
</P>
<P>
Before the scandal ended, John D. Ehrlichman, Nixon's top domestic policy 
adviser, G. Gordon Liddy, general counsel to Nixon's reelection campaign and 
eight others were found guilty of criminal acts connected to that conspiracy. 
The museum contains no mention of that first conspiracy or the convictions that 
flowed from it. 
</P>
<P>
The second conspiracy, which began almost immediately after the Watergate 
arrests, was designed to cover up the first conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlichman, H. R. Haldeman, who was Nixon's chief of staff, Atty. Gen. John N. 
Mitchell and eight others were found guilty of criminal acts in connection with 
that conspiracy. Nixon's own participation in the cover-up effort led the 
Watergate grand jury to name him an "unindicted co-conspirator" on Feb. 29, 
1974, and formed the basis for most of the impeachment charges that the House 
Judiciary Committee approved, 27 to 11, on July 27, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
As portrayed by the museum's display, the scandal that drove Nixon from office 
is far different, the way the former President has always seen it: "An epic and 
bloody political battle" in which Democrats sought to reverse the "mandate of 
the 1972 election" by forcing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the museum first hear of Watergate during a 27-minute film that 
portrays highlights of Nixon's career. The mention is brief. "The President 
knew nothing about it," a narrator says, referring to the Watergate break-in. 
But, the narrator continues, in the months that followed, "some of his aides" 
became involved in a "cover-up." The film then leaves the subject entirely, 
returning only to say, without further explanation, that "threatened with 
impeachment," Nixon resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The Watergate room itself presents a carefully selected set of facts about the 
scandal. Nixon, the opening display says, "did not pay much attention to" the 
break-in when he first heard of it the next day. That display does not mention 
the fact that Nixon and Haldeman met and discussed the break-in for 20 minutes 
two days later. 
</P>
<P>
The tape of that July 20 discussion was mysteriously erased -- the 18 
1/2-minute gap that became one of Watergate's most notorious incidents. 
According to the museum display, which mentions the gap but does not explain 
which conversation it involved, "experts said the gap could easily have been 
caused by a mechanical malfunction, but the President's opponents wasted no 
time in finding sinister and devious motives." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a team of experts appointed by U.S. District Judge John Sirica 
reported on June 4 that the tape had been erased by hand and that 
"malfunctioning of the recorder" was "conclusively eliminated" as a possible 
cause of the erasures.

IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AROUND THE SOUTHLAND ARE USING ATHLETICS TO HURDLE SOCIAL 
BARRIERS AND ADAPT TO AMERICAN CULTURE.

<P>
Soi Hoang will graduate from Verdugo Hills High School in June, and he hopes to 
play college volleyball someday. If he does well, he could make an All-American 
team. 
</P>
<P>
That would be a new experience for Hoang, who played on a high school team with 
students of just about every nationality except Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills finished second in its division of the city playoffs this spring 
with a team made up entirely of players from Vietnam, China and the 
Philippines. And none of the eight Latino players on the junior varsity even 
lived in this country a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States is a melting pot, the pot has boiled over in Southern 
California. In the Los Angeles Unified School District, which includes Verdugo 
Hills High, students speak more than 83 languages and dialects. 
</P>
<P>
In such an environment, school officials say, sports have become invaluable in 
the process of acculturation. Not only can sports draw students to class and 
help keep them there, but they also provide a way around the social, cultural 
and linguistic obstacles facing new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"Athletics are one of the easiest ways to break down the barriers," said Lou 
Ramirez, the athletic director at Birmingham High, a Los Angeles Unified School 
District campus in Van Nuys with a large non-English-speaking enrollment. 
"There's no question that athletics is the best deal. It's an international 
language. The kids get to know each other better. They come to depend on each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they get a little confidence in one thing, it carries over into others." 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Salcido, an associate professor of social work at USC and an adviser to 
Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), believes sports can also alter 
perceptions and boost self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say I'm a recent immigrant, and people don't like the way I talk and 
they don't like the way I look," Salcido explained. "But when I'm out there on 
the soccer field, hey, I'm a hero. I'm someone important. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for mental health and social health." 
</P>
<P>
Varant Vartabedian, athletic director at Holy Martyrs High School in Encino, 
believes this is especially true for immigrants whose homelands are at war or 
struggling with civil unrest. Dealing with uncertainties about friends and 
relatives left behind, he said, can be more difficult than learning a new 
language or style of dress. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the students at Holy Martyrs, which is affiliated with the Armenian 
Apostolic Church, come from strife-torn countries such as Lebanon, Iran and 
Syria. Vartabedian says involvement in sports "takes their minds off other 
things." 
</P>
<P>
"The way of life here is so different," said Vartabedian, who emigrated from 
Lebanon 12 years ago. "The majority of the students, until they get used to it, 
they are depressed. They feel something missing." 
</P>
<P>
Sports, Vartabedian said, can fill that void. 
</P>
<P>
"With a team, they feel like they are something important rather than just 
being a student in a school somewhere," he said. "It's something special." 
</P>
<P>
Although other methods of cultural integration -- such as classes, church and 
social groups -- are available for most students, experts say sports have one 
important advantage: relevance to the life students knew before. 
</P>
<P>
"English as a second language programs assist in socialization and give 
(students) something to strive for," Salcido said. "But the only way they can 
find something of social relevance, something that reminds them of home, is 
often through sports." 
</P>
<P>
The highly acclaimed Eastman Project, named for the East Los Angeles elementary 
school where it was founded, was built around that concept. Using sports, art 
and music, the program seeks to draw ethnic and non-ethnic students together 
and hold their interest through a creative break in the academic schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school district officials, alarmed at the growing dropout rate 
among ethnic students, are counting on such creative approaches. The district 
has seen its Latino enrollment nearly quadruple in the last two decades; today 
62% of the district's students are Latino. But with the Latino dropout rate at 
40% nationally, officials fear the district could lose many of those students 
before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Outlying school districts are beginning to confront similar problems as large 
immigrant populations spread to suburban areas such as the San Gabriel Valley, 
Glendale and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the kids . . . find themselves lost in the classroom," said Rudy 
Campos, who left a teaching and coaching position at Oxnard High last year to 
sell real estate. "(But) I saw a lot of changes in personalities and their 
attitude toward school on the soccer field." 
</P>
<P>
Campos remembers experiencing many of the same feelings when he and his family 
left Mexico and moved to Monterey Park more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience was culture shock," said Campos, who was 13 at the time. "I 
didn't speak a word of English. I didn't know what anyone was saying." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he remembered to bring a soccer ball -- and with that he began to 
find himself. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids played kickball, and that was a natural for me," he said. "That 
kind of broke the ice." 
</P>
<P>
Campos followed soccer to East Los Angeles College and eventually wound up at 
Whittier College on an athletic scholarship, graduating with a degree in life 
sciences. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big deal to get a scholarship to college, to go to a private college 
and live on campus," Campos said. "Sports was the thing that motivated me to 
continue in school. It was an incentive for me." 
</P>
<P>
But the link between athletics and academics can be a tenuous one, and moves to 
strengthen it can be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Students in the Los Angeles school district, for example, must maintain a C 
average to be eligible for extracurricular activities. Although that may lead 
some students to take their studies seriously, others struggling with the 
language often find the challenge too demanding. 
</P>
<P>
"I have mixed feelings about that (the C requirement)," said James Diego Vigil, 
an associate professor of anthropology at USC and an expert in minority 
affairs. "I know a lot of the athletes have the ability to achieve that. But 
there are some kids who, for some reason or another, cannot abide by that 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find a way to integrate those kids." 
</P>
<P>
Such a task is often easier on the athletic field than in the classroom, 
coaches, teachers and athletes say, because the most obvious obstacle, 
language, is more easily negotiated in sports. 
</P>
<P>
"People talk fast and they're hard to understand," said Dragan Jovanowski, a 
tennis player at North Hollywood High and a native of Yugoslavia. "But when you 
play tennis, you only count the points." 
</P>
<P>
At Oxnard High, Campos made the process of acculturation part of his team's 
daily regimen by refusing to speak Spanish during practice. That proved to be a 
break with tradition, but Campos believes his players benefited from it when 
they got back to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, most of the other coaches were walk-on coaches who really didn't 
understand the academic end of it," Campos said. "They always spoke to the kids 
in Spanish. (But) I wanted to get them familiar with what they would 
encounter." 
</P>
<P>
Campos' soccer players, most of them immigrants from Mexico, were already 
familiar with their sport. However, with the growth in ethnic diversity among 
recent immigrants, that's not always the case. 
</P>
<P>
Edvin Babayova, a Times All-Valley and All-City Section football player from 
Van Nuys High, played soccer as a youngster and didn't see his first football 
game until coming to the United States from Italy six years ago. His first 
gridiron was an asphalt street in the New York City borough of Queens. 
</P>
<P>
"It was weird," Babayova, 19, said of the experience. "The ball was a different 
shape, and all the rules, they didn't make sense to me. The first time someone 
threw the ball to me, I didn't run or move or anything. I think I threw it 
back." 
</P>
<P>
But football was popular. Everyone played football, and Babayova didn't want to 
stand out by refusing to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that in being part of a team, I would belong," he said. "The team is a 
lot like being with your brothers. I knew there was no going back (to Italy). I 
knew I would make it." 
</P>
<P>
At Alhambra High, a recent wave of immigrants from Southeast Asia has turned 
the school's athletic program upside down. The school, which once fielded a 
strong football team, has struggled in the sport recently. The Moors, as the 
team is named, won just four games in each of the last two seasons and, last 
fall, had to combine the freshman and sophomore teams because there weren't 
enough students to form two squads. 
</P>
<P>
In badminton, however, the school has evolved into a power in its region, 
reaching the playoff semifinals. One of its girls' doubles teams, meanwhile, 
won the section title. 
</P>
<P>
The change in Alhambra's athletic direction reflects a larger change in the 
community, which has absorbed a large number of Asian immigrants since the end 
of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
"The athletic program changes as the athletes change," Alhambra Athletic 
Director Steve Kemp said. "I don't think it's a matter of making a conscious 
effort to change the emphasis. Kids coming in with different abilities and 
different interest make that change." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they can put a strain on a school's athletic program and a 
premium on creative thinking. Kemp actively courts students with athletic 
talent once they enroll at Alhambra, and the approach has paid off. Students at 
Alhambra have apparently adapted to their new environment faster and have made 
consistently high scores on standardized academic tests. And at the same time, 
in basketball and badminton, Alhambra's teams have become among Southern 
California's best. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Mark, an associate vice president of civic and community affairs at USC, 
says academic achievement can be linked to participation in athletics, 
especially in the case of immigrant students. 
</P>
<P>
"(Sports) provides an area where students can feel good about themselves, and 
that carries over into academics," he said. "It serves as a way to boost 
self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
Those who work most closely with the athletes, as coaches and as teachers, 
insist that the benefits enrich the school as well as the students. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's more challenging, but I wouldn't have it any other way," said 
Dino Stirpe, the volleyball coach at Verdugo Hills High. "They (the immigrant 
students) bring so much to the school." 
</P>
<P>
It's clear that the students are beginning to feel more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I think of myself as an American," said Babayova, the football 
player from Van Nuys. "I play an American game and I believe in the American 
dream."

ISRAEL REASSURED ON MISSILE DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. AID: CHENEY SAYS THE ARROW PROJECT WILL CONTINUE DESPITE CRUNCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney assured Israel on Friday that the United States 
will continue to support Israel's $160-million Arrow missile-defense program 
despite the U.S. budget crunch. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said Cheney told Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens that 
Washington backs continuing research and development on the second phase of the 
project, which was launched two years ago as part of the U.S. "Star Wars" 
missile-defense program. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Pentagon statement said details of the second phase have yet to be 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's two-hour meeting with Arens was the first high-level contact between 
the Bush Administration and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's five-week-old, 
right-wing government. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said Cheney "stressed the friendship between the two countries and 
reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Israel's security." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the State Department announced that Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III will hold his first meeting with newly appointed Israeli Foreign 
Minister David Levy on Aug. 9-10 in Washington. Baker has been far more 
critical than Cheney about Shamir's government. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Baker hopes the meeting 
will help to "develop a credible basis on which to move the peace process 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
Baker has accused Shamir of foot-dragging on U.S. efforts to begin a dialogue 
between Israel and Palestinian representatives. Last month, Baker sarcastically 
recited the White House telephone number and told Israeli officials to call 
when they were ready for peace. 
</P>
<P>
Baker had suggested that Levy meet him in Paris earlier this week, but Levy, 
who is recovering from a mild heart attack, said he was too ill to make the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources have said Levy prefers to have his first meeting with Baker in 
the United States, rather than in a third country, to emphasize the importance 
of the U.S.-Israeli relationship. The fact that he readily agreed to a far more 
demanding trip so soon after the proposed Paris meeting seems to lend some 
credence to that view. 
</P>
<P>
Arens, Levy's predecessor as foreign minister, told reporters at the Pentagon 
that Israel "attaches very great importance" to the Arrow project, 80% of which 
is financed by the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
The Arrow is intended to shoot down the kinds of short-range missiles that 
Israel's Arab adversaries have deployed or are developing. 
</P>
<P>
It was proposed as an international contribution to the U.S. Strategic Defense 
Initiative, commonly called "Star Wars." Technologically, defending against 
short-range missiles poses far less daunting problems than the strategic 
missile defense that is the heart of "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
An Israeli spokeswoman said Arens told Cheney that the first phase of the Arrow 
project "is going very well, and we would hope to go ahead with the second 
phase." Israel hopes to deploy the weapon within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tutwiler confirmed that the United States has postponed a meeting, 
scheduled to begin next week, of a joint U.S.-Israel committee that coordinates 
Washington's $1.8-billion-per-year military aid program. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Israel said the postponement appears to be an attempt by Baker and 
the State Department to bring more pressure on Israel to agree to Washington's 
plan for negotiations with Palestinians. But Tutwiler said there is no such 
meaning to the decision. 
</P>
<P>
She said the meeting was put off until September because the size of the 
military aid program is one of the issues in the current round of budget 
negotiations between the White House and Congress. Until the budget is 
resolved, she added, there is no point in trying to plan ways to spend the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"The postponement is purely a practical matter," Tutwiler said. "United 
States-Israel relations remain strong. Our commitment to Israel's security and 
to the preservation of its qualitative edge remains unshakable." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Embassy spokeswoman Ruth Yaron said: "We were asked to postpone the 
meeting, and we agreed to the postponement. We don't read anything into it 
beyond what we were told." 
</P>
<P>
However, the postponement seemed to catch some Israeli officials by surprise. 
David Ivri, director general of the Defense Ministry and Israel's 
representative on the Joint Security Assistance Program committee, accompanied 
Arens to Washington, intending to remain for next week's meeting.

The death toll from Monday's earthquake soared to 659, including a U.S. Marine 
pilot surveying quake damage who was killed Friday when his small observation 
plane crashed into a wooded mountain outside the devastated city of Baguio. 
</P>
<P>
Another Marine was hurt in the crash, bringing the latest official figures for 
quake-related injuries to more than 1,300. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines' OV-10 observation plane crashed about 3 miles southwest of Baguio 
while surveying what appears to be a broad swath of destruction caused by the 
quake and more than 384 recorded aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching Manila indicated huge landslides had damaged scores of 
isolated villages in Luzon's northern mountains and had stranded or crushed 
hundreds of cars, trucks and buses on rural roads. At one place, villagers have 
chalked the message "We need food!" in a courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got an undetermined number of stranded and dead people out there," said 
Mike Gomez, spokesman for the Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
Although rescue teams continued to burrow through the rubble of the Hyatt 
Terraces hotel in Baguio, a U.S. team of 21 earthquake experts left the city, 
where there were at least 224 confirmed dead, and headed for Agoo in the 
neighboring province of La Union. Agoo's city hall, public market and a church 
reportedly collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, it's their belief there aren't any survivors left in Baguio," 
U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said. 
</P>
<P>
Six Air Force C-130 cargo planes ferried food and relief supplies to Baguio and 
brought out about 400 U.S. citizens and other foreigners. Roads to the city 
remain blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some reports of measles and typhoid breaking out in some smaller 
villages," Schrager said. But Gomez, the Health Department spokesman, said no 
epidemics had been confirmed, despite daily torrential downpours and poor water 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do have a problem with is tents, blankets and surgical implements," 
Gomez said. "Everyone is still outside." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials withheld the name of the dead Marine pilot until his family 
could be notified. The injured Marine was taken to a hospital at Camp John Hay 
in Baguio. They had taken off from the U.S. naval base at Subic Bay. 
</P>
<P>
At least one other American was killed in the quake. Richard Finley of 
Washington, D.C., who was here under contract for the U.S. Agency for 
International Development, was killed when Baguio's Nevada Hotel collapsed. At 
least one Filipino employee of the AID also is missing. 
</P>
<P>
A Philippine woman married to an American was also killed, but U.S. Embassy 
officials said it was not clear whether she was a U.S. citizen. Her name was 
not made public. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. relief operation, led by more than 250 doctors, engineers and others 
from Subic Bay and Clark Air Base, began within hours after the quake and has 
overshadowed criticism that the government's effort has been slow and often 
disorganized. 
</P>
<P>
President Corazon Aquino must approve all foreign disaster aid coming into the 
country, and diplomats complained Friday that customs officials have held up 
emergency communications equipment and other relief supplies pending her 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers and radio commentators questioned whether the American rescue effort 
would affect talks next month on the future of six U.S. military bases, an 
emotional issue that colors virtually every public debate here. 
</P>
<P>
One Manila radio station led its noon newscast with a report that Foreign 
Secretary Raul Manglapus and U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt had insisted there 
were "no strings attached" to the earthquake aid. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously going to have an effect" on the bases talks, a U.S. official 
said in frustration. "The problem is that every time they get in trouble, they 
call us." 
</P>
<P>
He said there were "a lot of parallels" to last December's attempted coup, when 
U.S. jets helped save Aquino's government by pinning down rebel forces. Two 
months later, Aquino snubbed visiting Defense Secretary Dick Cheney after 
critics insisted she was beholden to Washington.

LIBERIA REBELS OVERRUN NORTHERN PART OF CAPITAL

MONROVIA, Liberia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rebels overran most of northern Monrovia on Friday, pushing several hundred 
remaining government troops into a narrow strip of land on both sides of 
President Samuel K. Doe's executive mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported many government casualties, and shipping sources said two 
Liberian coast guard cutters were sunk in the port by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, led by former Doe aide Charles Taylor, captured Monrovia's 
2-square-mile port area in the northern suburb of Bushrod Island. They advanced 
toward the two bridges linking the island to the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Infiltrating rebel troops fought pitched battles with government soldiers who 
remained on Bushrod Island, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The main bridge across the Mesurado River was littered with the bodies of 
government troops, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department said the United States would not intervene 
to halt the two-day rebel offensive, the latest drive in the seven-month civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is to continue to urge both sides to participate in negotiations to 
prevent the further loss of life," State Department spokeswoman Margaret 
Tutwiler told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
She also said that there are no plans to dispatch a U.S. peacekeeping force 
once a new government is installed as requested by some Liberian officials, 
including Foreign Minister J. Rudolph Johnson, in a memo on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Most Liberians would welcome U.S. help in "averting massive plunder and tribal 
revenge" and in having Doe evacuated from the country, said one of the Liberian 
signers, former U.N. Ambassador Winston Tubman. 
</P>
<P>
But Nelson Taylor, the rebel leader's brother, said the appeal for U.S. help 
"is just one of the scams that Doe is using to involve the U.S. in a battle 
with the citizens of Liberia." He made the comments from his home in 
Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Monrovia, every shop and office was closed Friday. Nervous troops 
ordered civilians off the streets in an unofficial daytime curfew. 
</P>
<P>
A curfew remained in effect throughout the government-controlled areas. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers set up makeshift roadblocks at downtown intersections, firing wildly 
into the air to clear terrified civilians off the streets. Despite this, 
hundreds of frightened Monrovians gathered at the gates of the U.S. Embassy 
hoping to seek refuge, while scores of others broke into a U.S. Marine compound 
demanding food and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the government and the rebels have met intermittently for 
peace talks in neighboring Sierra Leone, but the negotiations have failed to 
make any progress. The rebels have refused to compromise on their demand that 
Doe resign before any cease-fire can be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels have accused Doe, who took power in a 1980 coup, of corruption, 
mismanagement and widespread human rights abuses.

U.S. SHIFT ON CAMBODIA ASSAILED AS INADEQUATE BY SENATE DEMOCRATS; 
</P>

The Bush Administration pleaded for bipartisan support of its new Indochina 
policy Friday, but ran up against a series of Democratic critics who complained 
that the new U.S. overtures to the governments of Vietnam and Cambodia do not 
go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
At a congressional hearing, several Democratic senators urged the 
Administration to end its strict trade embargo against Cambodia and to open up 
talks with the Vietnam-backed Cambodian regime headed by Prime Minister Hun 
Sen. Some of the Democrats also renewed calls for a cutoff in U.S. aid to the 
two non-Communist resistance groups that are fighting Hun Sen's government. 
</P>
<P>
"We must put an end to our economic embargo of Cambodia, which is causing 
untold damage to the Cambodian people and which also acts to prevent contact 
with Cambodia," said Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, one of the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing suggested that the efforts by Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
and others to defuse congressional criticism of U.S. policies in Indochina may 
not be successful, unless further changes are made in those policies. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Baker announced that the United States will enter for the first 
time into talks with Vietnam over the future of Cambodia. In addition, he said, 
the United States is withdrawing recognition from the rebel coalition headed by 
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian ruler, because this coalition 
includes the dreaded Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million people were killed or died of starvation and disease when 
the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia between 1975 and 1978. The secretary of state 
made clear that the overriding goal of U.S. policy in the region now is to 
prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was responding to mounting congressional pressure. Over the past few 
weeks, a growing number of Congress members -- apparently reacting to 
classified intelligence briefings -- have voiced concern that the Khmer Rouge 
are making rapid gains inside Cambodia and could conceivably be on their way 
back to power. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the Senate Intelligence Committee voted to cut off the longstanding 
U.S. aid to the two non-Communist Cambodian resistance groups. And a week ago, 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) managed to win support from 
leading Democratic and Republican members of the Senate Intelligence Committee 
for a letter calling upon the Administration to change course on Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Baker embraced some of the changes in policy suggested by 
Mitchell. At the same time, however, he and other Administration officials 
urged a continuation of U.S. aid to the non-Communist resistance groups. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Administration refused for now to enter into direct talks with 
the Phnom Penh regime, apparently because the Administration hopes to persuade 
Hun Sen and other leaders to step down and form some new coalition with 
non-Communist forces. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Richard H. Solomon, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian 
and Pacific affairs, urged Congress to close ranks with the Administration on 
Cambodia policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States can only be successful in helping shape developments in 
Cambodia if we have strong support, and bipartisan support, in the Congress and 
from the American people," Solomon told a Senate Foreign Relations 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
But among Democrats, only Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.), the son-in-law of the 
late President Lyndon B. Johnson, who first lost congressional support for 
American Indochina policy, seemed willing to go along. Robb said members of 
Congress should "try to achieve some sense of bipartisanship in our foreign 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
Edmund S. Muskie, the Maine Democrat who was secretary of state in the Jimmy 
Carter Administration, called for a lengthy list of further changes, including 
a cutoff in aid to the non-Communist resistance, direct talks with Hun Sen and 
an end to the U.S. trade embargo against Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Other Democrats, too, questioned why the United States is still unwilling to 
talk with the Phnom Penh regime. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are we willing to talk to Vietnam about Cambodia, but not to Cambodia 
about Cambodia?" asked California Sen. Alan Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry said he questioned whether Baker's announcement 
amounted to "a cosmetic change in U.S. policy that will permit fingers to be 
pointed, laying blame for a Khmer Rouge victory, rather than truly laying the 
groundwork for a peaceful resolution of this conflict." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Solomon told the Democrats that if Congress cuts off U.S. aid to 
the non-Communist resistance groups in Cambodia, "we would totally undercut 
their position and our own credibility." He said the U.S. aid is necessary "to 
provide the Cambodian people the alternative of an election with other than 
Communist options."

SPACE STATION STUDY PREDICTS REPAIR WOES

The proposed U.S. space station will begin to wear out while being built, 
requiring an unrealistic number of spacewalks for repairs before astronauts are 
even aboard to do them, a NASA study released Friday said. 
</P>
<P>
The findings raise questions about the feasibility of the proposed $30-billion 
space station, seen as the centerpiece of NASA's future space program, at a 
time when the space agency is already reeling from a series of setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
But space station director Richard Kohrs said he was confident the agency could 
overcome the potential problem and reduce the need for maintenance to a more 
realistic level. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident we'll get it down. It's going to take us two or three months but 
we . . . will be well within reason," Kohrs said. 
</P>
<P>
John Pike of the American Federation of Scientists was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they still have some serious unsolved problems that they're going to 
have to solve before they get the show on the road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA is already under fire because the space shuttle fleet has been grounded by 
fuel leaks and a defect in the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope has blurred 
the observatory's potentially revolutionary view of the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
The blunders have triggered a storm of criticism in Congress, which is 
considering NASA's $15-billion proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes to begin building the 
500-foot-long space station Freedom in 1996 or 1997 as an orbiting outpost 
where astronauts can conduct scientific experiments and stage exploration into 
the solar system.

2 COSMONAUTS MUST WALK IN SPACE AGAIN TO REPAIR A STICKING HATCH

Two cosmonauts who nearly ran out of oxygen when they were locked out of their 
space station by a sticky hatch must take another space walk next week to 
repair the door, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmonauts, who encountered the trouble when they were outside their space 
station making repairs on Tuesday, will venture out again to fix the hatch, the 
paper said. 
</P>
<P>
A ground controller at the Soviet Mission Control Center in Kaliningrad said 
cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin will make the new space walk 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Solovyev and Balandin went outside the Mir space station to fix thermal 
insulation that was damaged during the launch of the Soyuz TM-9 capsule they 
must use to return to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the strenuous space walk, which took two hours longer than 
planned, the cosmonauts were prevented from re-entering the spacecraft because 
they could not completely close the hatch they were using to re-enter. 
</P>
<P>
With their oxygen running dangerously low, they were forced to use an emergency 
porthole on another part of the space station complex to get back inside, seven 
hours after their exit. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, they apparently closed an inner hatch to seal one end of the 
air-lock compartment that leads to the troublesome outside hatch. Isaulov told 
Pravda that the outside hatch is "slightly ajar," leaving the air-lock 
compartment unsealed.

DE KLERK MEETS WITH MANDELA; 2ND ROUND SET

<P>
Amid worldwide calls to keep the peace process in South Africa moving, Nelson 
Mandela and President Frederik W. de Klerk met privately for an hour Friday and 
agreed to set Aug. 6 for a second round of talks between the government and the 
African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Mandela and De Klerk, at the presidential offices in 
Pretoria, came only two days after the ANC deputy president returned from a 
six-week international tour. And it indicated that both the ANC and the 
government want to quickly resolve the remaining obstacles to formal 
black-white negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
A joint ANC-government working group, set up during the first round of talks in 
May, has been drawing up a plan to meet the ANC's demand that all political 
prisoners be freed and all political exiles be allowed to return with immunity. 
Although details of the group's report have not been released, it is said to 
outline a phased release of political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The report also will make provisions for deciding who is a political prisoner. 
The ANC says about 3,000 prisoners have been convicted of politically motivated 
crimes, while the government, defining political offenses less broadly, 
estimates less than half that many. 
</P>
<P>
Senior government negotiators have said they support the working group's 
report, but the ANC has yet to make a final decision. The ANC's 37-member 
National Executive Committee will meet Monday and Tuesday in Johannesburg to 
consider the report as well as other matters. 
</P>
<P>
A statement released by De Klerk's office Friday said the next round of 
ANC-government talks will cover the recommendations on political prisoners and 
review the progress that has been made on others of the ANC's obstacles to 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
While Mandela was touring Europe, North America and Africa, De Klerk lifted the 
four-year state of emergency in three of South Africa's four provinces, going 
most of the way toward meeting that ANC demand.

BOMB BLAST RIPS LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE; NO INJURIES REPORTED; 
</P>
<P>
TERRORISM: APPARENT IRA WARNING ALLOWS TIME TO EVACUATE THE BUILDING AND 
SURROUNDING AREA.

<P>
A bomb apparently planted by the Irish Republican Army exploded Friday in the 
visitors' gallery at the London Stock Exchange, but there were no casualties 
because the building had been evacuated after a telephoned warning. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first such warning since the start of what appears to be a summer 
bombing campaign against political and financial targets in London. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 minutes before the blast at 8:49 a.m., a man who said he was a member 
of the IRA told a British news service that a bomb had been placed at the 
exchange and was about to explode. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said that if there had been no warning Friday, the human toll 
would have been very high. 
</P>
<P>
"There would have been injuries and probably fatalities among the people on the 
trading floor," Police Cmdr. Hugh Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the warning, which allowed the police to evacuate about 300 employees, 
did not detract from the gravity of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"We had only half an hour to reach the scene, evacuate the building and clear 
the surrounding streets," he said. "If we had been a few minutes later getting 
there, it would have been too late. These devices are unpredictable, and you 
cannot guarantee when they'll go off." 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she was appalled by Friday's attack but 
relieved that there had been no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the exchange building was extensive, however. Cmdr. George 
Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said the bomb 
blew a 20-by-7-foot hole in the building's facade, destroyed most of the 
visitors' gallery and littered the street outside with rubble. He said the bomb 
appeared to have been placed in the visitors' gallery men's room, possibly 
during the night. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion had little impact on stock trading, which is carried out largely 
by computer at brokerage houses elsewhere. The volume of business conducted on 
the trading floor has declined to the point that the visitors' gallery is 
scheduled to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Public reaction was generally light-hearted. 
</P>
<P>
"A computer crash would have hit London's financial markets far harder than 
today's explosion," the Press Assn., Britain's domestic news agency, quoted one 
broker as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the exchange building, many of the evacuated brokers continued to 
conduct business by means of cellular telephones. There was a brief, 10-point 
rally in share prices, which the Press Assn. attributed to "the British spirit 
of refusing to be intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
It was the police and intelligence services that appeared to be the most 
concerned about the explosion. One source said that because the bomb was 
designed to cause disruption rather than bloodshed, it tended to support fears 
that the IRA is returning to the terrorist tactics of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
At a late hour Friday there had been no formal IRA claim of responsibility for 
the bomb, but the man who made the warning telephone call reportedly used a 
code word, known only to militants and the police, that is used to distinguish 
warnings from hoax calls. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the IRA," he told the news agency Reuters. "The bomb is due to go off 
in half an hour at the Stock Exchange. Clear the building." 
</P>
<P>
If the IRA was involved, it was their first such move since last month's 
bombing of the Carlton Club, a popular haunt of members of the ruling 
Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers noted that Friday's bombing occurred precisely eight years after 
two IRA bombs exploded in London's Hyde Park as cavalry troops rode past, 
killing 11 soldiers and injuring 53 others.

8 PROSPECTIVE SITES FOR UC CAMPUS REVEALED; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: REGENTS ANNOUNCE POSSIBLE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY LOCATIONS FOR BRANCH. 
CHOICE WILL BE NARROWED TO TWO OR THREE BY NOVEMBER AND A FINAL SELECTION MADE

<P>
Eight rural sites in the San Joaquin Valley, including four near Fresno, were 
selected Friday as semifinalists in the heated competition to become home to a 
new University of California campus. 
</P>
<P>
Two areas near Modesto and others close to Merced and Porterville also were 
among the eight enormous tracts of farmland and ranches that will be much 
scrutinized over the next few months by the UC Board of Regents. The list is 
expected to be cut to two or three locations by November, with a winner 
announced late next year. 
</P>
<P>
However, UC President David P. Gardner warned that plans for the campus, which 
would be the 10th in the UC system, may halt if state budget cuts are too 
severe. He described Friday's site announcement at the regents' meeting in 
Santa Cruz as "an act of faith" that the state will provide the $300 million 
needed to build the school by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Many communities throughout the valley wanted the prestige and new businesses 
that come with a UC campus and were lobbying hard. Mayors and civic leaders 
came to the meeting to receive the good or, for such cities as Visalia and Los 
Banos, bad news. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be having a hell of a show," Jim Edmonson, a Merced activist, happily 
said of the community celebration party set for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Visalia's development director, Michael Ramsey, predicted 
that the disappointment of not being picked will be eased by the selection of 
another location in Tulare County, near Porterville. "There will be some 
letdown but a smile will quickly appear after people realize a UC could be 
built only 30 minutes from our town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
UC wants at least 1,500 acres with decent access to highways, airports and 
urban amenities, as well as a site with visual beauty and assured water 
supplies. The university hopes owners will donate the land. 
</P>
<P>
The selections were made in a closed-door session, which regents said was 
needed to avoid land speculation. Gardner described the debate as lively but 
"as objective and nonpolitical as possible," although he refused to give 
details. 
</P>
<P>
From north to south, the semi-finalists chosen from more than 75 contenders 
are: 
</P>
<P>
Mapes Ranch, a 5,600-acre site of largely flat pastures about 10 miles west of 
Modesto in Stanislaus County. The property is bisected by California 132 and is 
near the Tuolumne and Stanislaus rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Don Pedro, 3,000 acres of rolling hills 40 miles east of Modesto and a few 
miles south of the Don Pedro Reservoir. Also bisected by California 132, the 
location is in Tuolumne County. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Yosemite, five miles northeast of downtown Merced next to the large 
man-made lake. The 7,000 acres of rangeland has good views of the Sierra Nevada 
and is 10 miles from U.S. 99. 
</P>
<P>
Table Mountain, 5,200 acres just off California 41 on bluffs overlooking the 
San Joaquin River. Although this site is in Madera County, it is only 12 miles 
north of downtown Fresno, actually closer to that city than any of the three 
sites in Fresno County. 
</P>
<P>
Academy, 30 miles northeast of downtown Fresno in Fresno County. The 3,300 
acres of oak-covered hills and grasslands are off California 168. 
</P>
<P>
Watts Valley, also near California 168 and 30 miles northeast of Fresno. The 
4,800-acre tract is in the Sierra foothills. 
</P>
<P>
Trimmer Springs, 2,100 acres about 25 miles east of Fresno and 10 miles north 
of California 180. The rolling terrain is near Centerville. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier Valley in Tulare County, about eight miles north of Porterville and 
five miles east of California 65. The 2,900 acres are in a river valley along 
the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement intensified rivalry among community groups. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Madera County Supervisor Gail McIntyre pointedly described the two 
Modesto area sites as "so far out in the boonies that they don't seem 
realistic." And Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos), who represents Merced, 
joked that the Cal State campus in Fresno should be moved to Merced if a UC 
Fresno is built. 
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin Valley campus is planned to be the first of three new UC 
campuses which officials say are needed by the year 2005 for an expected 
enrollment boom. The valley was chosen first because its high school graduates 
attend UC at half the statewide rate, presumably because there is no UC campus 
in the region.

SMITH PRODS LUNGREN TO RETURN OIL MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat Arlo Smith called Friday on his Republican foe for state attorney 
general, Dan Lungren, to return $8,600 in campaign contributions and any legal 
fees he has received from major oil companies to avoid potential conflicts of 
interest on environmental issues if elected in November. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing wrong with representing oil companies," said San Francisco 
Dist. Atty. Smith at a press conference outside the gates of the Chevron U.S.A. 
oil refinery in El Segundo. "(But) I think that it creates a conflict if in 
fact you are attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren replied later that he has no intention of returning the contributions 
he has received from Chevron, Atlantic Richfield, Texaco, Union and Shell 
during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to return any monies from anybody who is in good standing in 
California and can lawfully give money as part of the political process," the 
former congressman said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren added that he has not personally represented any oil companies since 
joining a Sacramento law firm in early 1989. Smith should have known that, he 
said, because Smith had already raised the question last week at a Contra Costa 
County press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lungren said, Smith has no business talking about potential conflicts 
because campaign finance reports show that Smith has been a longtime 
shareholder in oil firms including Atlantic Richfield, Mesa, Rock and Amerada 
Hess. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who said he sold the stocks early this year, also attacked Lungren for 
his support of offshore oil-drilling projects. Drilling will remain an issue in 
the campaign, Smith said at his noontime press conference, despite the recent 
decision by President Bush to prohibit drilling off the coast of California in 
coming years. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow the President can say there will be offshore drilling," Smith said. 
"It's not a law. . . . After the election, it can be changed."

EXXON TANKER LEAVES DRY DOCK

<P>
After nearly a year in dry dock in San Diego Bay, the Exxon tanker involved in 
the nation's worst oil spill returned to water Friday night after undergoing 
multimillion-dollar repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Towed by four tug boats, the Exxon Mediterranean, formerly the Exxon Valdez, 
was floated out of its dry dock for the first time and moved into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
It was escorted a quarter of a mile to an outfitting pier, where it was berthed 
to undergo 10 days of equipment checks and other tests to evaluate its 
seaworthiness. A two-week sea trial is scheduled for early August, followed by 
a voyage to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
When the damaged ship was brought to San Diego last July for $30 million in 
repairs, officials said whole sheets of the tanker's skin on the starboard side 
appeared shredded, twisted and crumpled, as if it were flimsy aluminum, not 
3/4-inch thick steel.

GOVERNOR RESTORES SOCIAL PROGRAMS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: HE ACCEPTS $60 MILLION IN CUTS IN LESS CONTROVERSIAL ITEMS TO PUT BACK 
FUNDING TO FIGHT CHILD ABUSE AND SERVE THE DISABLED.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a gesture that could be worth more in politics than in dollars, Gov. George 
Deukmejian on Friday reduced his budget-cutting plan by $60 million, agreeing 
instead to a pair of less controversial legislative proposals that would save 
the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
Although the move hardly makes a dent in the $3.6-billion spending gap that has 
stalled progress on a state budget for three weeks, the health and social 
service cuts abandoned by the Republican chief executive were among the most 
contentious on his list of program reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he no longer would press to eliminate a program that trains 
children to guard against child abuse, and he said he would retain 28 centers 
that help disabled people live on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's proposal to eliminate the child-abuse program had angered its 
creator, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), a powerful member of the 
Assembly's budget-writing committee. Deukmejian's proposed elimination of the 
independent living centers had attracted dozens of disabled protesters to his 
Capitol office, including 35 who were arrested there earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also dropped proposals to eliminate the state's Alzheimer's disease 
diagnostic centers and a program to train health professionals to serve 
minority and low-income areas. And he said he would agree to higher payments to 
families caring for foster children. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative proposals the governor accepted included a change in the way 
the state contributes to the teachers' retirement system, which would save $50 
million next year, and a plan to cut $10 million from payments to local 
redevelopment agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Both proposals were overwhelmingly approved by the Assembly on Thursday even as 
Republicans in the lower chamber were rejecting a Democrat-drafted 
$55.4-billion spending plan, which was balanced with the help of $1.3 billion 
in new taxes and fees. Although the state is now a record 21 days into the 
fiscal year without a budget, no further action on the issue is expected before 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I have said all along that if the Legislature didn't like specific spending 
reductions and reforms I have proposed, I would consider alternate proposals, 
provided that they produce real savings and budgetary reform," Deukmejian said 
in a statement released by his office. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Waters described as "great news" Deukmejian's agreement to retain 
the child-abuse prevention program she started. 
</P>
<P>
"These are very small programs but they're very important because they address 
very important needs," she said. "It makes me feel a helluva lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Assemblyman John Vasconcellos of Santa Clara, chairman of the Ways 
and Means Committee, said the governor's action was a "move in the right 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a modest beginning," Vasconcellos said. "The proposed elimination of 
those programs was so stupid and obnoxious that it's nice to have him recognize 
his own errors." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after successful legal action on behalf of welfare recipients and 
health care providers, state employees who have already gone without one 
paycheck and are in danger of missing another turned to the courts for relief 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Unions representing most of the state's 190,000 employees announced they were 
filing suit in federal and state court to force the state to meet a forthcoming 
$500-million end-of-the-month payroll. 
</P>
<P>
The legal action also seeks to free a $6-million payroll for 7,800 employees of 
the Legislature and the Department of Transportation that the state missed 
earlier this month. About two dozen Caltrans workers staged a noisy protest 
Friday at the Capitol, shouting "Nuke the Duke" and carrying signs saying "When 
is Payday?" 
</P>
<P>
"Our members are suffering drastic repercussions as a result of this completely 
frustrating political situation," said William A. Biggs, president of the 
Alliance of Trades and Maintenance, which represents the Caltrans workers. "We 
have received a multitude of phone calls from highway workers in drastic 
situations. Power is being shut off to their houses. Eviction notices are being 
served. Some employees are being threatened with going to jail for non-payment 
of child support." 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis is prohibited by the California Constitution from meeting 
any of the state's financial obligations until the Legislature approves a state 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
But during the last week, court rulings have freed $149 million in welfare 
funds, $489 million for Medi-Cal and $50 million for in-home care workers. Two 
federal judges have held that the state has no right to stop paying for those 
programs, which are jointly funded by the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
The state employees hope the courts also will force the state to mail their 
paychecks on the grounds that non-payment would be a violation of federal labor 
laws. Lawsuits by the Caltrans workers' union and the California State 
Employees Assn., representing 95,000 workers, will probably be heard in U.S. 
District Court here early next week. Pat McConahay, a spokeswoman for the CSEA, 
said state workers need a legal ruling by the end of next week for the checks 
to go out on time.

State budget -- An article on Saturday incorrectly identified one of the

FEDERAL FEEDBACK POSITIVE ON OTAY MESA BINATIONAL AIRPORT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal officials are enthusiastic about the idea of building a binational 
airport at Otay Mesa, San Diego representatives said Friday after a whirlwind 
lobbying tour here. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the novel immigration and customs problems posed by a binational 
airport, "no one said that it can't be done," said City Councilman Ron Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
In a flurry of meetings with four federal agencies, the State Department, the 
Pentagon, Capitol Hill and the Mexican ambassador, San Diego city and county 
representatives spent two days promoting their proposal for an international 
airport to straddle the territories and jurisdictions of the United States and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who has been one of the strongest proponents of the idea, said the 
delegation wanted to find out from federal officials whether the idea was 
viable from Washington's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer, clearly, was 'yes,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said government reaction ranged from "cautious optimism" at the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Customs Service, to 
"genuine enthusiasm" at the Department of Transportation and the Federal 
Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"They are really singing our song," concurred Galen J. Reser, an assistant 
secretary at the Transportation department. "It is not every city or region in 
the country that is thinking about the explosion of air traffic that we are 
going to see in the future. They are forward-thinking. They want to be ready 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, both the INS and Customs voiced initial opposition to the idea. A 
binational airport "would severely impact upon Border Patrol operations," the 
INS said in a letter to Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado), and the Customs 
Service complained to him that "such an airport would be a high-risk facility 
for the smuggling of aliens and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
But, in meetings Thursday and Friday, these agencies muted their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we would have concerns about security, illegal migration of aliens 
and drug flow," said Gene McNary, commissioner of the INS, "but we are always 
open to new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
"We have concerns but they are not negative concerns," said Robert Bartol, 
director of the Customs Service office of passenger enforcement and 
facilitation. "We look at the issues as things to be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Bartol said the Customs Service is still worried about increased opportunities 
for smuggling and the general difficulty of collecting tariffs and conducting 
border operations in a "binational enclave." He said they could also face 
problems from "tangential activities" like hotels and car rental agencies that 
grow up around airports and crowd out land for government facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation traveled to Washington under the auspices of the regional 
planning commission, or Sandag (San Diego Assn. of Governments). 
</P>
<P>
Roberts made the trip on behalf of Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who had planned to 
make the trip but stayed in California to be with her husband, who is ill. 
Other delegation members included Leon Williams, chairman of the San Diego 
County Board of Supervisors, Port Commission Chairman Milford Portwood and Lois 
Ewen, a Coronado councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening, the group had a private meeting with the Mexican 
ambassador, Gustavo Petricioli, who advised them on the protocol for pursuing 
the airport plan with the Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's representatives in Congress are deeply divided over the idea of a 
binational airport. Only two of them, Reps. Ron Packard (R -- Oceanside) and 
Bill Lowery (R -- San Diego) -- both supporters -- showed up for a Thursday 
afternoon session in Washington. Packard said the airport plan has "great 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a rush because we are rapidly losing airport sites to development," 
he explained. "All available sites will be gone in a few years. My colleagues 
may soon find that (Otay Mesa) may be the only logical site." 
</P>
<P>
Division in congressional ranks "won't make it any easier" to gain federal 
approval, said Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D -- San Diego), who opposes the airport idea, said he 
boycotted the meeting because the lobbying trip is a "charade. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal is not well-conceived, it is not well-studied, and they are 
proceeding in an inadequate manner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Hunter also opposes the airport plan, citing the danger of building a 
"cocaine gateway." 
</P>
<P>
Bates contended that the delegation had not adequately considered the option of 
joint military-civilian use of the Miramar Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts reported that, in a meeting with U.S. Navy officials Thursday, the 
"message was loud and clear" that the Pentagon would block any joint use of 
Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the final two meetings on Friday, with the Transportation 
Department and the FAA, were the "capstone" of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the most familiar with the options," he said, "so they were a little 
less scared " by the binational concept. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one operational multinational airport in the world -- the 
international airport in Geneva, which is operated jointly by the French and 
Swiss governments. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag is planning a trip to Mexico in mid-September to discuss the binational 
proposal with Mexican officials. Roberts said the next step after that will be 
to draw up a memorandum of understanding for reaching a final plan. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery expressed hope that the proposed airport will be discussed at a 
U.S.-Mexican summit meeting between President Bush and Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari next December. Presidential attention could move the issue 
forward more quickly, Lowery said, and avoid getting the plan bogged down in 
the bureaucracy.

Disneyland, world-famous for its sparkling-clean park, agreed Friday to pay the 
largest toxic waste fine ever assessed by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency for hiring a company that illegally disposed of its hazardous materials 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
The $550,000 fine settles a complaint filed by the EPA under which the Walt 
Disney Co. was charged with 38 violations of federal toxic waste laws during 
1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials said Disneyland hired a company that illegally hauled 14,000 
gallons of paint thinner, cleaning solvents such as acetone and other toxic 
materials to two disposal sites, in Wyoming and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen separate shipments were trucked to a Wyoming oil-disposal plant and 
one to a Utah plant -- neither of which have the authority to handle the types 
of waste sent by Disneyland, according to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
Disney officials acknowledged the illegal disposal and said they are extremely 
embarrassed by it. They said they did not know that their contractor, Ken's Oil 
Co. Inc. of Garden Grove, was handling the waste improperly until they were 
notified by the EPA last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We were guilty of naivete to an amazing degree," said Kym Murphy, corporate 
vice president of environmental policy for the Disney Co., based in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good working relationship with the contractor, and we thought it was 
all being done with the appropriate procedures and permits." 
</P>
<P>
Federal law, however, says a company that produces the waste is the party 
responsible for ensuring it is handled safely from creation to disposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We take these violations very seriously," said David Janik, an enforcement 
attorney in the EPA's Denver office who handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
"These facilities need to follow strict procedures and safeguards, or we can't 
ensure that the materials aren't going on the ground or someplace else unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
The $550,000 fine is the largest in the nation paid by a company for improper 
disposal of toxic waste since the EPA began enforcing the federal laws 14 years 
ago, Janik said. 
</P>
<P>
A larger fine, $2 million, was paid a few years ago by Chemical Waste 
Management for violations at its toxic waste landfill in Kettleman City, near 
Fresno. But that was a disposal facility, not a company that generates waste, 
and the penalty was assessed through the U.S. attorney's office, not the EPA, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA originally sought $950,000 in the Disneyland complaint, based on 
$25,000 per violation. The settlement took several months of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that even for a company as large as Disney, the fine is "very 
substantial." 
</P>
<P>
"Being a first offender, we could have been treated a little more cordially," 
he said. "I thought we should be given probation, not a fine." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the EPA is using Disneyland to set a tough and visible 
example for other companies. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly will get industry's attention," Murphy said. "They picked a 
company that really showcases their seriousness. When the general public hears 
this, they think 'My gosh, Disneyland, how could Disneyland even have hazardous 
waste?' " 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of U.S. companies generate hazardous waste, with more 
than 5,000 of them in Orange County alone. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials said they are not picking on Disneyland. The size of the fine is 
appropriate for the large number of shipments that went to the plants 
illegally, Janik said. 
</P>
<P>
Four other Southern California companies and the city of Fontana, which all 
used the same two plants, are being fined $75,000 to $150,000 apiece. The fines 
are smaller because fewer shipments were involved, Janik said. 
</P>
<P>
EPA inspectors discovered the violations while checking the Wyoming plant's 
records, he said. EPA officials are trying to track down what happened to the 
paints and solvents at the plants, which are in La Barge, Wyo., and near Salt 
Lake City. The plants have EPA permits to recycle or burn only oil, not other 
wastes. 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know what happened to the waste, or whether there was harm to 
the environment or public health," Janik said. "If it was burned, there could 
have been improper emissions." 
</P>
<P>
Janik said the EPA has filed a complaint seeking to shut down the plants, both 
owned by a company called Mountaineer Refining. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Disney filed suit in Orange County Superior Court against its 
contractor, Ken's Oil Co. Inc. Ken's officials were unavailable for comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ken's had been a Disney contractor for eight years, until its dismissal last 
year after the EPA told Disney of the violations, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials said that Disney was cooperative in the investigation and that 
they have no evidence indicating that company officials knew of the violations. 
But they said Disneyland officials signed the federally required forms that 
show where the shipments are going. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have checked into this facility," Janik said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, Disneyland is conducting an environmental audit at 
the park and beginning an employee training program. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty is especially ironic because Disneyland, which celebrated its 35th 
birthday Tuesday, takes great pride in its cleanliness. Its streets are 
steam-cleaned daily, and its attractions are repainted almost continually. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the same products that keep the park so clean -- solvents, paints 
and varnishes -- are toxic materials that must be disposed of only at special 
hazardous-waste sites. The theme park uses about 20,000 gallons of paint per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely difficult lesson for us to learn this way," Murphy said. 
"The amount of waste was small, and it certainly wasn't malicious."

NAVY REVEALS, DEFENDS JETTY PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
HARBOR: ANAHEIM BAY WOULD HAVE A SEPARATE ENTRANCE FOR SMALL CRAFT AND MORE 
VERSATILITY FOR WARSHIPS UNDER A PROPOSAL FOR NEW WHARVES. BUT NEIGHBORS FEAR 
SURF AND THE AREA'S CHARACTER WOULD SUFFER.

<TEXT>
<P>
Saying that the improvements will mean better boating safety and less beach 
erosion, the Navy on Monday night will unveil to the City Council a proposal to 
change the entrance to Anaheim Bay by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The bay, which is between Seal Beach and Huntington Harbour, is the waterway 
used for Navy ships to load and unload ammunition at the Seal Beach Naval 
Weapons Station. Private boats, including those docked at Huntington Harbour, 
also use Anaheim Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy is proposing to add a $150-million extension to the east jetty 
protecting the bay, which would give private boats a separate bay entrance. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy emphasized that its proposal is only in the talking stage so far. But 
the concept has already drawn opposition from one homeowners' group, Surfside 
Colony. A spokesman for the group said Friday that the Navy's proposal would 
ruin the oceanfront by making it more like a protected bay. 
</P>
<P>
However, an official with the Orange County Harbor, Beaches and Parks 
Department said that he has studied the Navy's plans and found them to be 
beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
"These plans have a lot of value in that they improve access to the harbor 
</P>
<P>
(Anaheim Bay) by private vessels," said Larry Paul, manager of coastal 
facilities for the department, which is part of the county's Environmental 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Paul said he agreed with the Navy's contention that new jetties would slow down 
beach erosion in the Sunset and Surfside areas. 
</P>
<P>
The battleship New Jersey was among the vessels that visited the waters off 
Anaheim Bay on Friday. The New Jersey's ammunition was unloaded in preparation 
for the vessel's decommissioning in Long Beach, but the ship could not safely 
go inside the present east and west jetties, according to Navy officials. 
</P>
<P>
For occasions such as the New Jersey's unloading, the station needs a wharf 
farther out from land than the existing one, said Navy officials, who added 
that the new jetty plan would provide such a wharf. 
</P>
<P>
Tad Nizinski, a civilian coastal engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers, 
said he could not predict what impact the Navy's proposed changes would have on 
the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"What this could do is hard to answer without making studies with physical 
models," he said. "This could either slow the (beach) erosion, (or) it could 
move the erosion further down (to Bolsa Chica State Beach), or it may help 
altogether. We don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Navy Capt. Stephen T. Holl, commanding officer of the Seal Beach Naval Weapons 
Station, will present the bay-jetty proposals to the Seal Beach City Council on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Friday, Holl said the plan has benefits both for the Navy and 
local communities. 
</P>
<P>
"First, a pleasure craft will have direct access to Huntington Harbour -- a 
benefit for boaters and Navy security," Holl said. "Second, the jetty extension 
will act as a barrier against beach erosion in the Sunset and Surfside beach 
areas, and it will offer limited storm protection. Finally, as dredging is 
completed, there will be a one-time sand 'dividend,' which can be used to beef 
up the beaches in Sunset and Surfside." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Thomas, a spokesman for the Navy's weapons station, said the proposed 
changes to the bay and the jetty would allow easier access for newer, bigger 
Navy ships. The existing harbor was designed in the World War II era. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the proposals would enable the Navy "to handle faster the loading 
and unloading of ships that currently are anchored at buoys several miles from 
the Anaheim Bay wharf." 
</P>
<P>
Those ships have to be unloaded outside the harbor, Thomas said, because they 
are too big for the existing wharf facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's plans call for building two new wharf areas. Both would be on a 
reconstructed east jetty. The outermost new wharf would be an L-shaped arm. The 
new inner wharf would be on a jetty inside the existing harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas noted that the plans call for cutting an opening through the existing 
east jetty. That cut, coupled with dredging away a finger of land inside the 
harbor, would provide the new entrance to the bay for private boats, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kendrick, president of Surfside Colony, a homeowners' association with 
about 260 members, criticized the Navy's proposal. Kendrick said the area's 
beach erosion problems stem from the Navy's original construction of jetties 
about 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The community overwhelmingly wants to let the Navy know that we don't want any 
further development," Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the jetty changes would make a protected bay of the oceanfront area. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be no more surf," Kendrick said. "It wouldn't be a beach, it would 
be a bay, and the visual impact . . . would be serious. We didn't buy 
properties here to live on a bay." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said the Surfrider Foundation, a private environmental group, will 
also oppose the Navy's proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, the Navy's spokesman, conceded that building a longer jetty "would mean 
less surf for some surfers" in the immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the proposal would greatly improve safety by allowing private 
boats a quicker, easier access to Huntington Harbour, without mingling with 
Navy craft in Anaheim Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the plans call for construction to start in 1993, with completion 
by 1997. The construction would be in three phases; the final, L-shaped outer 
wharf would not be built until the last phase. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the proposal "will undergo scrutiny at Navy headquarters in 
Washington before being submitted to Congress for funding."

BOY HURT BY SAW GETTING LOTS OF SUPPORT DURING RECOVERY

<P>
Antonio Galvan and his 3-year-old son, Ryan, are nearly inseparable. And since 
Tuesday, when the shipping clerk's only son was nearly cut in half by an 
electric circular saw, the two have grown closer than ever. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a quick trip to his Fullerton home for a shower and a 
change of clothing Thursday afternoon, Galvan has ventured no farther from 
Ryan's side than the cafeteria at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where the 
boy, the youngest of five Galvan children, remains in critical but stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Each evening, Galvan has put aside a good night's sleep to stand by the frail 
boy's side, stroking his thick, black hair and whispering encouraging words in 
his ear while nurses periodically replace fluid bottles and check the various 
tubes that are connected to his small body. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that he's awake all the time," Galvan said, "he is hurting a lot. He 
doesn't want me to go away." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan was injured around 4 p.m. Tuesday when he wandered outside his family's 
West Baker Avenue home after he and his father had returned from a trip to the 
grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a family friend who was using the power saw to replace some front 
windows on the house had put the tool down -- plugged in and without a 
protective guard around its blade. As the friend walked away to get another 
blade, Ryan, fascinated by tools, picked up the saw. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, Galvan was putting away groceries when he heard his son scream 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost track of him for just a moment," Galvan said. 
</P>
<P>
The saw blade became embedded in the boy's lower abdomen, severing much of his 
large and small intestines but, luckily, leaving his stomach and other vital 
organs mostly intact, doctors said. The boy, who underwent four hours of 
surgery, is expected to fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokeswoman Ellen S. Ball said that hospital administrators have 
arranged for a trust fund to be established at a local bank and are encouraging 
concerned callers to send checks to help defray the cost of the soaring 
hospital bill that the family is expected to face. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the hospital has already received dozens of calls from 
well-wishers inquiring about where to send money, get-well cards, balloons and 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
"For every person that called and offered help," Ball said, "I believe that 
there are many more who haven't called but want to." 
</P>
<P>
Lois Rotruck, an administrator for Security Pacific National Bank, said that 
she opened the free account on Thursday afternoon after Ball called. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the least we can do, from one human being to another," said Rotruck, who 
visited Ryan as he rested in the hospital's pediatric intensive care unit. 
"This little guy is really the hero in all this. He's a real little trouper." 
</P>
<P>
Galvan said that insurance will pay 80% of the bill. The remaining 20%, Ball 
acknowledged, is likely to run into the thousands. Galvan said he may have to 
mortgage his house or liquidate some life insurance to come up with the money. 
</P>
<P>
His son is expected to remain in intensive care for at least another six days 
and then be transferred to another room for an undetermined period. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know when he will come home," Galvan said. "But he is real tired of 
the place. He keeps telling me to take him home." 
</P>
<P>
To keep Ryan's mind off the recurring pain that racks his body, hospital staff 
brought in a videocassette recorder so that he can watch "Ghostbusters" and 
"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," his two favorite movies, Galvan said. In addition, 
his bed is cluttered with stuffed cartoon characters such as Bart Simpson, 
Mickey Mouse and Wile E. Coyote. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan said that Ryan does not consciously recall any details surrounding the 
accident. He still wonders how he got hurt and ended up in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Gracie Galvan, the boy's mother, said he sometimes is startled by loud whirring 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone was using a vacuum cleaner outside (the intensive care ward)," she 
said. "It woke him up, and he started crying. I think he was afraid. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Galvan said the family is considering psychological therapy for the boy 
once he is released from the hospital. But he is confident that the only 
permanent scar the boy will carry is the one that will stretch across his 
belly. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be fine," Galvan said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFF-DUTY OFFICER SHOT, FIRES AT FLEEING 
SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty Los Angeles police officer who was fired on after a near-collision 
with another car shot at two gun-wielding youths in that car, wounding one, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Oscar Winslow, 29, fired eight shots at the car, hitting a 16-year-old 
in the arm and hip. 
</P>
<P>
No one else in the car, including a man, another youth, two women and a 
4-year-old boy, were hit. 
</P>
<P>
Winslow then chased the car when it sped off, said LAPD spokesman Don Lawrence. 
Winslow fired two more rounds at the car when it stopped at an intersection and 
the other youth allegedly got out of the back seat with a handgun, Lawrence 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The second barrage of shots sent the suspects fleeing again, according to 
Lawrence, but their car later struck a utility pole at Westmoreland and 9th 
Street. Winslow held all six occupants of the car at gunpoint until 
reinforcements arrived, Lawrence said. Marco Silva, 20, and the two teens were 
held on attempted murder charges.

EXXON TANKER INVOLVED IN ALASKAN OIL SPILL RETURNS TO WATER; 
</P>
<P>
SHIPPING: THE REPAIRED AND RENAMED EXXON VALDEZ WILL HEAD OUT ON ITS FIRST 
ASSIGNMENT, TO PICK UP OIL IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND CARRY IT TO EUROPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After nearly a year at dry dock in San Diego Bay, the Exxon tanker involved in 
the nation's worst oil spill returned to water Friday night following massive, 
multimillion-dollar repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Towed by four tugboats, the Exxon Mediterranean, formerly christened the Exxon 
Valdez, was floated out of its dry dock for the the first time and moved into 
the bay. It was escorted a quarter mile to an outfitting pier, where it was 
berthed to undergo 10 days of equipment checks and other tests to evaluate the 
tanker's seaworthiness. A two-week sea trial, scheduled for early August, will 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's refloating is a significant milestone in the return of this vessel to 
service," said Robert Weatherford, Exxon Shipping Co. business and planning 
manager, during a news conference held aboard the repaired tanker Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hallett, chief financial officer at National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., 
said shipyard workers began the 24-hour process of flooding the dry dock 
Thursday. Once the water level reached the same height as the bay Friday night, 
the gate of the dry dock was opened. He said the tanker was released and slowly 
floated out. 
</P>
<P>
The gray and red tanker, 987 feet long and 166 feet wide, is now docked at 
Nassco's Pier 6, just south of the Coronado Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The ship has undergone major repairs since last September to its single-skin 
steel hull at the Nassco shipyard, where it was built in 1986. When the damaged 
ship docked at Nassco, officials said whole sheets of the tanker's skin on the 
starboard side appeared shredded, twisted and crumpled, as if it were flimsy 
aluminum, not steel three-quarters of an inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmetic changes to the tanker included the words "Exxon Mediterranean" freshly 
painted on the ship's stern and a new coat of dark red paint on its 
reconstructed hull. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, repaired to its "original construction," is tentatively scheduled 
to make its first voyage to the Middle East in mid- to late August, Weatherford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, reporters were invited by Exxon and Nassco officials aboard the 
ship's bridge for the first time since the tanker spilled 11-million gallons of 
crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound in March, 1989. It was towed into 
San Diego Bay last July for a $30-million repair job at Nassco. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was on schedule and on budget," Nassco president Richard Vortmann 
said. "Nothing of this magnitude has ever been done before, so this was a 
tremendous technical engineering feat." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Tom Gillette said one-third of the tanker's bottom was repaired 
or replaced, a process that used 3,000 tons of steel. He said that final 
repairs on the 3-year-old, highly automated tanker were completed last week, 
and the ship is in "tiptop" shape. 
</P>
<P>
"I can finally get back to what I was trained to do," said Capt. Mike Stalzer, 
who will captain the ship during the sea trial and its first assignment to the 
Middle East. He earlier served as a captain on the Valdez, but was off duty at 
the time of the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Shipping Co. President Gus Elmer announced the tanker's new route, which 
will be outside U.S. waters, and its new name earlier this month. He said the 
tanker will load Middle Eastern oil in the Mediterranean and deliver it to 
Europe, becoming the first U.S.-licensed tanker to enter foreign service. 
</P>
<P>
Stalzer, 39, said the Mediterranean's first voyage will probably include a stop 
in Singapore to refuel. 
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean's new route, Gillette said, will probably include loading at 
single-port moorings off Turkey and Egypt and making stops at Trieste in Italy, 
Marseille in southern France, Port Jerome in western France and Rotterdam in 
the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't leave here until everything is tested and we're thoroughly 
satisfied," Stalzer said, noting that the engine room machinery, navigational 
system, radars and other state-of-the-art equipment on board will be tested 
during the two-week trial run, which will be held outside traffic lanes 100 to 
150 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard and American Bureau of Shipping inspectors will accompany Stalzer 
and his 20-member crew on the repaired tanker's trial run, said Paul Meyers, 
project manager for Exxon. He said the tanker, one of the largest in Exxon's 
13-ship American fleet, will renew its Coast Guard two-year certification as a 
seaworthy vessel during the test run. 
</P>
<P>
As the Valdez, the tanker, outfitted with a 4-foot-deep, 8-by-12-foot swimming 
pool, was designed to travel from Alaska to Panama, along with sister ship 
Exxon Long Beach. Exxon no longer trades in Panama and delivers Alaskan oil 
exclusively to the U.S. West Coast. Gillette said the decline in Alaskan crude 
production prompted Exxon officials to reassign the 30,000-ton tanker to the 
Middle East route. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials denied the tanker's name and route were changed as a public 
relations ploy. They also stood by the company's decision not to equip the 
tanker with a double hull.

GROUPS CALL BOYCOTT OF SALVADORAN COFFEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saying that the Salvadoran government receives much of its financing for death 
squads from the sale of coffee, members of three organizations Friday urged 
county residents and businesses not to buy Folgers or Hills Brothers coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a national group, Broad Movement in Solidarity with the People of El 
Salvador, and the Orange County Committee on Central America said at a press 
conference they held in Santa Ana that the coffee is a vital source of income 
for the government of the war-torn Central American nation. 
</P>
<P>
About 60% of El Salvador's coffee, worth $400 million, is shipped to the United 
States. U.S. aid also helps finance the squads, members say. 
</P>
<P>
Folgers, the country's best-selling coffee brand, and Hills Brothers are the 
focal point of the boycott because they are two of the largest manufacturers of 
coffee, though most coffee manufacturers buy some of their beans from El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"We choose them because they are the big guys, and if they stop, smaller brands 
will hopefully follow suit," said Genevieve Crawford of the organization, 
Neighbor to Neighbor, a national group which started the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said the coffee earnings help finance the Salvadoran military, which 
is linked to death squads that are accused of killing more than 70,000 
suspected rebels, their families and sympathizers over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor to Neighbor began the boycott in November, shortly after the 
assassinations of six Jesuit priests, their cook and her teen-age daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has been proven time and time again that U.S. policy in that 
country is a failure," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
In a response to the boycott, Folgers said in a letter to the group that it 
buys coffee beans from more than 30 countries and that less than 2% of the 
beans it buys come from El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also said that the company agreed with the U.S. government's 
decision to support the government of El Salvador. The groups also plan to 
demonstrate Saturday outside Gelson's Market in Newport Beach. ALLISON SAMUELS

MAYOR CATLIN HOME AFTER BEACH WIPEOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin has been released from the hospital, nearly a month 
after he suffered a spinal cord injury while body surfing. 
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old mayor said he will continue to undergo physical therapy at St. 
Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The accident left Catlin with partial paralysis in his hands and feet, but he 
indicated doctors expect a complete recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"I received a bruise on my spinal cord," said Catlin, who has to use a cane to 
get around. "I'm still walking with a limp. And I'm trying to get back control 
of my feet and hands through exercise and therapy." 
</P>
<P>
Catlin said he had been body surfing in Laguna Beach and was heading back to 
shore when the accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
"The wave hit me and drove me into the sand," he said, recounting the June 21 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't move my feet or hands, and I was under about 1 1/2 feet of water. I 
could see the surface, but I couldn't move." 
</P>
<P>
Catlin credited his wife and a friend, Carol Howard, with saving his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't hold my breath any longer, and I thought for sure I was a goner," 
he said. "The next thing I felt were these hands grabbing me and pulling me 
ashore." 
</P>
<P>
Catlin said he is keeping busy by doing city work and preparing for his 
reelection campaign this fall. "I'll still be able to make key City Council 
meetings, and I'm signing papers at home." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Chris Norby has been filling in for Catlin since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I'll remember about this whole thing is the cards and letters 
from concerned people. You'd think I was George Bush or something," Catlin 
said, laughing. ERIK HAMILTON

CITY WARNS CALTRANS ON 10-LANE FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 60 homes and businesses, including key redevelopment projects, could 
be eliminated if the state Department of Transportation widens the Santa Ana 
Freeway beyond eight lanes, city officials said this week in a report to 
Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
Ten or 12 lanes "would have an adverse impact on the community," Director of 
Engineering Don Jensen said. "We endorse eight lanes." 
</P>
<P>
But Caltrans spokesman Albert Miranda said a tentative decision has been made 
to widen the freeway to 12 lanes in the communities south of Buena Park, 
including Anaheim. A determination regarding Buena Park has not been made at 
this time, he said, adding that the 12-lane configuration is preferred. 
</P>
<P>
The project is part of a billion-dollar expansion from the intersection of the 
Santa Ana and San Diego freeways in Orange County to the San Gabriel River 
Freeway (605) in Los Angeles County. Buena Park would be included in the last 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report sent to Caltrans, Buena Park would lose $1.75 million 
in annual sales taxes if the freeway is expanded beyond eight lanes. Two 
redevelopment projects could be jeopardized -- an auto mall and a retail center 
that are being developed adjacent to the freeway for visibility. 
</P>
<P>
"Several, if not most, of the automobile dealers would be faced with relocation 
to another city," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the threat, officials say they will proceed with the redevelopment 
projects. "We are going ahead," said Gus Duran, acting director of 
redevelopment, about the retail center at Artesia Street and Manchester 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Duran said city officials pursued the projects despite plans for the freeway 
widening because it seemed Caltrans would never have adequate funding to carry 
out the project. Funding for the Buena Park phase still has not been secured, 
Miranda said. Because of this, construction might not begin for seven years, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The state will hold a series of public hearings on the project before a final 
decision is made. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the widening project is to reduce traffic congestion and 
increase the capacity of existing freeways. A total of 17.5 miles of freeway 
are expected to be included in the makeover. LYNDA NATALI

CITIZENS MAY DECIDE ON USE OF PARKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will hold a special meeting Monday night to consider putting 
an advisory measure about Central Park on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Erskine said the council will discuss a proposal that would ask 
voters how unimproved land in Central Park should be used. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably have six or seven land-use choices to present to the voters," 
said Erskine, who is on a subcommittee assigned to study the parks matter. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this summer, Erskine proposed putting a bond issue on the Nov. 6 
ballot. He said the bonds could be used to finance several major projects 
needed to improve Central Park. But after discussing the subject with the six 
other council members, Erskine agreed that the city first needed to get the 
voters' sentiments about various park projects. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed choices range from "grass, trees and picnic areas" to "building an 
18-hole golf course," Erskine said. 
</P>
<P>
One portion of unimproved Central Park land has already been designated by the 
City Council as the site for a "youth sports complex." The council on July 2 
voted to dedicate acreage at the intersection of Golden West and Talbert 
streets for youth baseball and soccer fields and for a gymnasium. BILL BILLITER

San Diego police are trying to identify a Latino man found dead in an alley 
Friday from an apparent drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whom police believe was a transvestite, was wearing a pink blouse and 
black skirt in the north alley of the 3000 block of National Avenue, said 
Homicide Lt. Paul Ybarrondo. 
</P>
<P>
There was no obvious trauma to the body, leading police to suspect the man died 
of a drug overdose and then his body was dumped in the alley, Ybarrondo said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably a bunch of people shooting up. Then one dies, so you take it 
out and dump it so you don't have the evidence of a narcotics transaction," 
Ybarrondo said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the man was about 5 feet, 8 inches tall, weighed about 150 pounds 
and had dark curly hair that was frosted on the ends. Police have no other 
information on the man. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, three transvestites have been killed in San Diego. Two were killed 
in shootings near the San Diego Wild Animal Park in June and a 24-year-old man 
was shot to death July 3. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarrondo said the police are not investigating Friday's death as a homicide.

Caltrans has reduced by 2% the amount of water it uses on highway landscaping 
since 1986, despite expanding its landscaping acreage, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
California Department of Transportation officials discussed their water 
conservation measures in San Diego County Friday at a press conference along 
Interstate 5 in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Two road signs also were unveiled to indicate the state agency's use of 
reclaimed water near the intersection of Cassidy and Soto streets. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is the state's largest user of water for landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Reclaimed water was one of several measures that Caltrans has adopted to combat 
the drought that has plagued Southern California for four years, said Jesus 
Garcia, Caltrans' District 11 director. 
</P>
<P>
Reclaimed water is used to irrigate 50 acres along Interstate 15 north of 
Mission Valley and 108 acres along I-5 in Oceanside and Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also uses drought-resistant plants, computer-controlled sprinklers, 
drip irrigation and mulch to conserve water.

A 16-year-old boy was being held Friday in Juvenile Hall on suspicion of 
attempted homicide after shooting his father in the head and stabbing his 
mother in the abdomen and chest, a San Diego police spokesman said.

<P>
The boy's name was not released because he is a juvenile.

James Arp, 39, is in serious condition and his wife, Deborah Arp, 38, is in 
critical but stable condition at Mercy Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
The couple live in the 4400 block of Polk Avenue with their 16-year-old son, a 
12-year-old daughter, and a 5-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the incident are sketchy, and police still do not know a motive, 
said police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Officers were called to the house shortly after 6 a.m. Friday. A 9-millimeter 
handgun was found in the house, Robinson said. Police have released no other

<P>
CAL LUTHERAN RECORD SETTER ATTACKS BROADCASTING CAREER WITH SAME ZEAL HE 
DISPLAYED ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His spirit remains relentlessly bright, like the summer San Diego sun. As Hank 
Bauer often shouted when he walked onto the football field: It's a great day to 
be alive. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer rises at 4 a.m., and within an hour is taping his morning sports 
broadcast for KKYY radio in San Diego. Next, he dashes over to KFMB-TV and is 
on the air at 6:40 as sports anchor. Then he cuts back to the radio station for 
an 8:20 broadcast. The rest of the day is spent collecting news for his 
afternoon TV broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Bullish and buoyant, Bauer keeps moving but never leaves the spotlight. Rivers 
of adrenaline still rush through his veins. Bauer, 36, personifies the 
overachieving underdog; once again he has built a career from the ground floor 
through determination and ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
"There are direct parallels between playing football and broadcasting," he 
says. "When the whistle blows, I'm in control. I know when I stink and I know 
when I'm great. There is the instant gratification and the public scrutiny that 
most players miss when they retire. 
</P>
<P>
"The news business is ever-changing, just like a football game. No two plays 
were ever the same and no two broadcasts are ever the same." 
</P>
<P>
Variety has always spiced the life of Bauer, Cal Lutheran's only 1,000-yard 
rusher and a three-time NFL special-teams player of the year with the San Diego 
Chargers. Throughout his six-year NFL career, he delighted everyone from 
teammates and coaches to fans and the media by being unpredictable yet 
reliable, unheeding yet prepared, reckless yet attentive. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can play on special teams, but to be good, I think you have to be kind 
of sick, where you really don't care about your body," Bauer used to say during 
his playing career. "Actually, getting your bell rung doesn't feel too bad. It 
feels kind of good." 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-10 1/2, 205 pounds, Bauer was a bowling ball gone berserk. In 
addition to single-handedly making special-teams play fashionable in the NFL, 
he was a short-yardage rushing specialist. In only 22 carries in 1979, he 
rushed for nine touchdowns and eight first downs. A crucial play against the 
Pittsburgh Steelers in a game at San Diego that year illustrated his popularity 
-- and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers led, 21-7, and faced fourth-and-goal from the two-yard line late 
in the game. Coach Don Coryell called timeout to confer with quarterback Dan 
Fouts. Bauer stood nearby, hoping to enter the game, when a teammate tapped his 
shoulder and said, "Hank, do you hear that?" 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of more than 50,000 was on its feet, chanting, "Bau-er, Bau-er, 
Bau-er." Coryell turned to Bauer and said, "I'm no dummy. Get on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Recalls Bauer: "I ran out and (Steeler linebacker) Jack Lambert stared at me 
with his hands on his hips, spitting out blood. He said, 'You aren't gonna get 
in this time.' I blurted back some expletive." 
</P>
<P>
Fouts handed off to Bauer, who barreled into the end zone. The chants continued 
through the ensuing kickoff, on which Bauer made the tackle. "I enjoyed a 
special-teams tackle as much as scoring a touchdown," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "Howitzer" for his gung-ho style, Bauer was the most special of 
special-teams players. "He's the best I've ever seen," Coryell said. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a compliment for a fellow who signed with the Chargers as a free agent in 
1977 after teaching high school for a year. Bauer set nearly every school 
rushing record during four years (1972-75) at Cal Lutheran, but he weighed only 
190 pounds and was not drafted. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer, who helped the Kingsmen get to the NAIA final his senior year, holds Cal 
Lutheran records for career carries (502); touchdowns in a game (four), a 
season (17) and a career (38); and yards in a season (1,024) and a career 
(2,700). 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys offered him a free-agent tryout in 1976 but he was cut after 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was good enough to play in the NFL," says Bauer, still irked at being 
snubbed by the team that trained at Cal Lutheran during his playing days there. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer spent the next year teaching and working out. Although he added 15 pounds 
of muscle, there was little interest from NFL teams. At times, his efforts 
seemed fruitless, like banging his head against a wall. But then, Bauer never 
had an aversion to that sort of behavior at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated the first hit of a game, so I'd always take a few head butts against a 
concrete wall during warm-ups," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer also played outfield on the Kingsmen baseball team. While chasing a fly 
ball one day with his typical fervor, he slammed face-first into the chain-link 
outfield fence. 
</P>
<P>
"His face looked like a waffle in the pattern of the chain-link," recalls Al 
Schoenberger, a Cal Lutheran assistant coach at the time. 
</P>
<P>
With the ball at his feet, Bauer stepped back from the fence, grunted, and 
pounded his forehead on the adjoining fence post. Then he picked up the ball 
and threw it to the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Such intensity is more appropriate on the football field. "If ever there was a 
guy who played offense with a defensive mentality, it was Hank," said Keith 
Richard, a former Cal Lutheran football teammate of Bauer's. "It seemed like 
every day at practice, a fight would break out. Hank and I rolled around on the 
grass a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it was over and, boom, we were best of friends. There were never hard 
feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Bauer, in fact, was a leader. The night before a game in 1975, he and teammate 
Dan Morrow loosened the support in the fence behind Mount Clef Stadium at Cal 
Lutheran. The next day during introductions, rather than lead the team through 
the gate, Bauer and Morrow dashed straight through the weakened fence, and were 
followed by 35 inspired Kingsmen. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw guys get fired up who never had before," Morrow recalls. "That started a 
trend that the players used for years afterward. They'd run through that 
fence." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there had to be a place in the NFL for a maniacal motivator like 
Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
When the Chargers made a lukewarm offer to let this small back from a small 
school get a second chance at trying out with the big boys, Bauer excitedly 
packed a few T-shirts, jocks and socks in a duffel bag and puttered his beat-up 
Volkswagen to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Every week, Hank would call and say, 'I stuck, I stuck,' " recalls Jim Bauer, 
Hank's older brother and a Cal Lutheran standout from 1968-71. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers played the Rams in The Times Charity Game that summer and several 
of Bauer's former Cal Lutheran teammates attended. On the opening kickoff, the 
new Charger flew down the field intent on making the tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams ran a reverse and Tom Mack blindsided Hank, caught him right in the 
ear hole," Jim Bauer recalls. "Hank's head hit the ground first and I got a 
real sick feeling in my stomach." 
</P>
<P>
In a daze, Bauer pulled himself off the ground and ran to the Rams' sideline, 
where an opposing player pushed him back on the field. He wandered aimlessly 
through the end zone until a Charger official grabbed his arm and led him to 
the proper sideline. Later in the game, Bauer was back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
After spending his first year solely on special teams, Bauer shared time at 
running back in 1978 and 1979, scoring 17 touchdowns. However, the Chargers 
acquired talented running back Chuck Muncie in 1980 and made running back James 
Brooks their first draft choice in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew my backfield days were numbered," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than demand a trade or grouse to the media, Bauer carved out a new role. 
"I decided to out-study everybody and make special teams my life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In his career, Bauer played every position on the kickoff return, punt return 
and kickoff teams. He played everywhere on the punt team except punter and 
snapper. He was honored as special-teams player of the year in 1980, '81 and 
'82 and paved the way for a special-teams player to be named each year to the 
Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, nobody did the job I was doing," he says. "I relished it. It was 
a blue-collar job. If I left a legacy at all, it was to legitimize special 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his kamikaze style, Bauer never missed a game at Anaheim Magnolia High, 
Cal Lutheran or San Diego. He injured his neck in practice midway through the 
1982 season, however, and although he finished out the year, he retired before 
the 1983 season rather than risk permanent damage. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer was only 29, but Coryell immediately hired him as an assistant coach. He 
had dabbled in broadcasting as a player, and when the team's ownership and 
coaching staffs changed after the 1986 season, Bauer went behind the microphone 
full time. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't the story of a huge star getting his first broadcasting job handed 
to him based on his reputation as a player," Bauer says. "I started at the 
bottom and I've earned what I've gotten. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like when I was trying to make it in the NFL. I knew in my heart I 
could be a sportscaster and I've put in a lot of hard work. I've paid the price 
and am still paying the price." 
</P>
<P>
And just as in his playing days, it's one he is pleased to pay.

HEAT TAKES ITS TOLL ON SCGA FIELD; 
</P>
<P>
AMATEUR GOLF: DEFENDING CHAMPION STANKOWSKI SLIPS TO SECOND-PLACE TIE WITH 
VOGES AFTER 67 ON FIRST ROUND. WI BARELY SURVIVES CUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Paul Stankowski of Oxnard and Mitch Voges of Simi Valley had to settle for a 
second-place tie midway through the 91st Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
And, on a Friday hot enough to wilt a shrub, the only man to play two better 
rounds of golf than they did was a landscape architect. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Duncan, 32, of Rancho Santa Fe, put together rounds of 67 and 72 over the 
tight, 6,531-yard Wilshire Country Club course to grab first place. Stankowski, 
20, had rounds of 67 and 73 and Voges, 40, shot 72-68 to trail Duncan by a 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Wi of Thousand Oaks, the 18-year-old who stunned the state's amateur 
golfers a month ago by winning the California Amateur on the Monterey 
Peninsula, struggled in the 100-degree heat. He posted an opening-round 73 and 
then stumbled to a 76. His total of 149 was also the 36-hole cut. He and 31 
others advanced to today's second round. The championship round is on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who did not advance were Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys, who lost to 
Wi in the semifinals of the state championship and was the 1988 SCGA amateur 
champion. He shot rounds of 72 and 80, carding a 9 on No. 17, a par-4, during 
the afternoon round. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Zambri, 19, of Thousand Oaks, shot rounds of 76 and 68 and made the cut 
at 144, while Don Baker of Canoga Park recorded rounds of 76 and 72 and also 
made the cut at 148. Also advancing were Chris Etue of Canoga Park (145) and 
George Gottschalk of Lancaster (149). David Olsen of Sherman Oaks shot a 153. 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski, a junior at Texas El Paso, won the tournament last year at the 
Glendora Country Club. He tied for low medalist honors in this year's state 
amateur tournament before losing in match play to Wi. 
</P>
<P>
He said the blistering heat wore him out following his morning round of 67. 
</P>
<P>
"I really felt it at the end of the first round," he said. "I was really tired. 
I sat in the shade for an hour, and then didn't even want to get up again. 
Later in the day I think it started to bother me. I lost my concentration a 
little bit and my focus wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski captured the Oxnard City championship by a whopping eight strokes 
three weeks ago, and said he knew he would have to bring his best game into the 
SCGA tournament to win. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a stronger field here than there was for the state amateur," he said. 
"This tournament just has better golfers, from top to bottom. I knew I had to 
bring my A-1 game to win this one. And I think I have." 
</P>
<P>
Voges, who plays out of Wood Ranch Country Club in Simi Valley, finished in the 
top five in last year's SCGA Mid-Amateur Championship, and made it to match 
play of the 1990 state amateur.

UNSUNG HEROES LIFT WEST STARS TO VICTORY IN ALL-STAR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the time Friday night's Daily News All-Star football game got under way at 
Birmingham High, Jesse Wallace of Monroe High and Jamal Anderson of El Camino 
Real were sick of hearing about the East. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the East has Jerome Casey, people said. Oh, the East has Howard Blackwell, 
people said. Look at those East quarterbacks, people said. Mike Wynn and Rob 
Westervelt are going Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Enough is enough, the West buddies decided. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace rushed for 65 yards and a touchdown in 12 carries and Anderson rushed 
for 80 yards and two touchdowns in 15 carries as the West hung on to defeat the 
East for the fourth consecutive year, 20-13, before a crowd estimated at 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
East drove to the West eight-yard line with less than a minute to play, but 
Wynn was sacked by Eric Hale and Joe Mahoney on consecutive plays to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
A combination of Anderson, Wallace, Colin Havert (47 yards, nine carries) and 
Joe Tushnet (63 yards, six carries) outshone an East ground game that netted a 
mere 56 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They had more (publicity), but tonight was my night to shine," said Wallace, 
who is considering playing at either Glendale College or L. A. City College. 
"Tonight, I got bit with a bug to play. I wanna go back to school and play." 
</P>
<P>
The West had to overcome a 13-7 East halftime advantage, forged on a 14-yard 
Greg Jones run and a 77-yard pass from Casey to Chad Miyata. 
</P>
<P>
The Miyata score was perhaps the game's most spectacular play. Casey took a 
lateral pass from Wynn and fired downfield to a wide-open Miyata, who coasted 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson scored on a one-yard plunge to account for the halftime score. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the West took the lead for good, 14-13, on Wallace's 
three-yard run with 10:57 left in the game. The score capped a 92-yard drive, 
highlighted by a nifty 35-yard cutback run by Reseda's Tushnet on a delayed 
pitch from Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the lead, West went straight ahead on its next possession behind 
Anderson, who took seven consecutive handoffs from Danny Larson on a 51-yard 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson capped the drive with a six-yard run with 5:29 left, making the score 
20-13. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a cramp," Anderson admitted of his workload. "But when the game is going 
like that, you've got to put those things away." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its 13-7 halftime advantage, the East was dominated statistically in 
the first two periods. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven of its 94 total yards came on one play -- the halfback pass 
involving Wynn, Casey and Miyata. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace gained 46 yards rushing on eight carries for the West in the first 
half, and completed three of four passes for 41 yards. Anderson gained 39 
first-half yards on seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace's quarterback teammate, Danny Larson of Birmingham, completed two of 
three passes for 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt had a rough go of it in the first half, completing none of six 
passes for the East.

WOODLAND HILLS WEST REACHES FINAL WITH BANNER EFFORT; 
</P>
<P>
LEGION: WOODLAND HILLS EAST DROPS 4-3 DECISION TO RIVAL FOR ITS FIRST SETBACK 
IN THE DOUBLE-ELIMINATION TOURNAMENT.

Generally when East meets West in sports, the playing fields are adorned with 
lively, colorful banners, the flags of the competing countries whip in the 
breeze and, sometimes, "The Star-Spangled Banner" will blare from quadraphonic 
speakers above the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday at Birmingham High, there were no banners, flags or national anthems 
-- just an intense rivalry waged between Woodland Hills East and Woodland Hills 
West in the third round of the American Legion District 20 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
This time the West prevailed, 4-3, to advance to the District 20 championship 
game Sunday at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
The defending District 20 champion's opponent in the final will be determined 
today at Birmingham. Panorama City will play Glendale at 11 a.m. and the winner 
will battle Woodland Hills East at 3 p.m. The three teams have one loss in the 
double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
West and East entered the game with identical 21-4 records. The teams are not 
the best of friends and things got heated in the seventh inning with West 
leading, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
West pitcher Corey Bromberg, who was working on a three-hitter through six 
innings, accidentally hit East cleanup hitter Jamie Zeichick in the face with a 
pitch. After several moments on the ground with face in hands, Zeichick grabbed 
the ball and made a motion to throw at Bromberg but hesitated and dropped the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
After Zeichick was awarded first base, East touched Bromberg for three singles 
and a run-scoring balk to pull within 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
West Coach Don Hornback said Bromberg (5-1) was having trouble with his 
off-speed pitches in the sixth, seventh and eighth innings, during which the 
right-hander surrendered four of East's six hits. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked him if he had enough left to throw just fastballs and he said, 
'Yeah.' " Hornback said. "We told him to throw nothing but fastballs in the 
ninth inning. You see what he did to the last two batters? He blew them away." 
</P>
<P>
After East's John Erganian led off the ninth with a walk and Matt Allison flied 
to center field, Bromberg struck out Mike Krasner and Eric Rothman on 0-2 and 
1-2 pitches, respectively, for his sixth and seventh strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"The only letdown was when I hit Zeichick," Bromberg said. 
</P>
<P>
West jumped to a 3-0 lead in the first inning when No. 3 hitter Del Marine sent 
Ryan Revel's 2-2 pitch over the center-field fence -- about a 410-foot blast -- 
for a two-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Geller scored West's first run after leading off the first with a double, 
moving to third on Jeff Marks' bunt single and scoring on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Marine scored West's fourth run in the third on a double play. 
</P>
<P>
In an elimination game earlier in the day at Birmingham, Glendale held on to 
edge Quartz Hill, 8-7, after holding a 6-2 fourth-inning lead. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill rallied for three runs in the fifth and two in the seventh but was 
stopped short of tying the score in the ninth. With two out, Bryan Lovelace 
singled to right and darted to third on a throwing error before Jimmy Weese 
flied out.

SPORTS ET CETERA: HOLIDAY BOWL ON A SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in the game's history, the Sea World Holiday Bowl this year 
will be played on a Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 13th annual game will be played at 4:30 p.m. Dec. 29, also the earliest 
kickoff in its history, the game committee announced. 
</P>
<P>
"The weekend date means local fans will not have to battle rush-hour traffic to 
get to the stadium, and those coming from out of the area will also find 
Saturday a more convenient date," Holiday Bowl President L. Robert Payne said. 
</P>
<P>

INDOOR SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
Milan Mandaric, owner of the MISL St. Louis Storm, said he is optimistic that 
his team will not fold, as has been rumored, and set Monday as the date a 
decision will be made on the future of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Mandaric, who lives in San Jose, has been looking for St. Louis investors for 
his financially ailing team. He said "some" St. Louis business leaders have 
come forward and that St. Louis Mayor Vince Schoemehl has begun soliciting 
support on Mandaric's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things are happening in the last minute," Mandaric said Friday. "The 
mayor of the city and others want to give some support to the club, and I'm 
waiting to see how things develop." 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the eight-team league could hinge on that of St. Louis. Other 
owners reportedly do not want to go forward with just seven teams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING 
</P>
<P>
Poway High School, whose boys' and girls' swimming teams have won San Diego 
Section titles the past two years, both earned spots in the National 
Interscholastic Swimming Coaches of American TNT Power Ranking poll. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan boys were ranked ninth nationally among public schools with over 
1,900 students and 20th among all public schools but dropped to 28th nationally 
when independents were included. The girls were ranked 14th, 28th and 33rd.

MASTERS NATIONAL CYCLING;

<P>
OREGON WOMAN FINALLY CAPTURES HER GOLD 
</P>

<P>
After pocketing five medals (three silver and two bronze) since the start of 
the Masters National Cycling Championships a week ago, Janice Gaines of 
Portland, Ore., finally won her first gold medal Friday at the Velodrome in the 
women's 30-34 10-kilometer points race, an event in which she had never 
competed. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines also earned the award for best all-around rider on the track. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Betsy King (multi-national champion from Gainesville, Fla.) before 
the start, and she was talking about positioning and strategy," Gaines said. "I 
just wanted to stay upright. I had practiced it (racing on the track) so I'd be 
safe and so riders around me would be safe. After I went for the first sprint I 
thought I'd go for it. I wanted to get a (national champion) jersey really 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
In a points race, cyclists sprint every fifth lap and are awarded points 
according to their positioning. In the women's race, which was 30 laps around 
the track, points were doubled at the 15th lap and again on the final lap. 
</P>
<P>
"It was going so fast I didn't know who was around me or who was getting the 
points," Gaines said. "I was determined to do well, to gut it out when I was 
hurting near the end. In every race I ride, I always continue to push hard and 
control the race from the front." 
</P>
<P>
Local riders Tani Barbour of Vista and Tracy Evans of La Mesa placed second and 
fourth, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 45-49 20-kilometer points race, Jim Montgomery of Herndon, Va., 
successfully defended his title, followed closely by Victor Copeland of Rancho 
Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
"My strategy was to initially take it easy then, when I saw the field tiring, I 
was going to come from behind and dive down the track and break away," Copeland 
said. "When it came down to the last lap, Dan Wulbert (of Cardiff) said 
something about me going ahead. Then Jim attacked and he jumped ahead. I'd 
liked to have won, but I don't mind losing to (Montgomery)." 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 55-over 10-kilometer race, Larry Reade of Buffalo, N.Y., lapped 
the field to easily capture the national title. The race was stopped midway 
through to clear a cyclist who had slipped off his bike and had to be taken off 
the track. Reade said this definitely had an effect on the concentration of the 
cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what was going to happen. They (the officials) wanted us to move 
to the side of the track. I was standing up there shaking," Reade said. "There 
was too much time to cool down."

Lisa Kiggens was just one stroke ahead of Akiko Fukushima after the first eight 
holes of the final round of the Optimist Junior World Championships, 
15-17-year-old division. 
</P>
<P>
But no great match ensued. Instead, at the par-4 ninth, Kiggens birdied, 
Fukushima bogeyed and Kiggens never let her lead shrink below three strokes 
from that point on. She shot a three-under 71 on the Torrey Pines North Course 
and finally won with an eight-under-par 288. Fukushima shot a final-round 69 
but finished at 292. 
</P>
<P>
On the South course, where the boys were playing, a similar story unfolded. 
Notah Begay entered the day with a four-stroke lead over Travis Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Williams cut it to three on two occasions but could get no closer as Begay won 
his second Junior World Championship. He shot a final-round 73 for a four-round 
total of 280, eight under, while Williams finished at 286 after a final-round 
75. 
</P>
<P>
Begay last won three years ago in the 13-14 age group. 
</P>
<P>
It was Kiggens' first Junior World title. Going in to the final round, it 
appeared her stiffest competition would come from Kim Marshall, who was four 
shots back in second place at 221. 
</P>
<P>
But Marshall started Friday's round erratically, bogeying three of the first 
four holes. 
</P>
<P>
Fukushima, meanwhile, was birdieing three of the first five holes to move past 
Marshall to within two strokes of Kiggens. 
</P>
<P>
Both Fukushima and Kiggens parred the par-3 sixth and par-4 seventh. Kiggens 
lost another shot on the eighth and saw her lead shrink to one shot, but she 
remained unshaken. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried not to be concerned with Fukushima's charge," she said. "I just 
concentrated on my own game." 
</P>
<P>
On the South course, there was no real charge, Williams simply stayed three, 
four or five strokes behind Begay all day. 
</P>
<P>
The last time he pulled to within three was on the par-four 15th, when Begay 
bogeyed and Williams parred. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, "I was hoping to make up one stroke a hole," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
But instead he got into trouble on the par-3, 201-yard 16th when he decided to 
tee off with a three-iron. 
</P>
<P>
Not a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke my three-iron about two weeks ago, and I probably shouldn't have used 
this one because I wasn't used to it at all," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
He hooked it into a ditch left of the green, got out and three-putted for a 5. 
</P>
<P>
"I just played terrible," said Williams, who led after the first two rounds. 
"Whenever I got within three strokes, I would mess up. I bogeyed on 2 (after 
birdieing the first hole) and three-putted on 16. I just couldn't get anything 
going." 
</P>
<P>
Begay parred both 16 and 17, then finished with a flurry, birdieing 18. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted," Begay said, "to go out there and do what I've been doing the 
past three days."

BAD MIX SOURS 'DRINKING IN AMERICA'

The land of the free and the brave is a prison for the 14 characters in Eric 
Bogosian's one-man show, "Drinking in America." 
</P>
<P>
No one has stuffed them in a penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
They themselves have built the bars to keep out that confusing and frightening 
proposition called life. 
</P>
<P>
Bars of alcohol. Bars of drugs. Bars of sex. 
</P>
<P>
The first to replace Bogosian in the collection of roles, longtime film, 
television and stage actor Nehemiah Persoff debuts in "Drinking in America" at 
the Elizabeth North Theatre through July 29. 
</P>
<P>
Good actor. Good material. Wrong match. 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian, who is in his mid-30s, first performed the material in 1986 in a 
highly successful six-month run at the American Place Theatre in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Persoff's obvious respect for Bogosian's work, watching the 71-year-old 
actor play a one-time hippie, drugged-out teen-ager and a black street person 
fantasizing about a limousine is uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
It's like watching an actor use all the crowbars of his craft to try to pry 
inside a world in which he has never really lived. 
</P>
<P>
Persoff is likely to do better in his one-man show, "Sholem Aleichem" headed 
for the Hahn Cosmopolitan Oct. 14-23. 
</P>
<P>
Here he strikes gold in only one of the 14 vignettes -- but that one, in which 
he plays a ceramic-tile salesman at an out-of-town convention, is enough to 
show how good Persoff can be when the material is right for him. 
</P>
<P>
The salesman has just entered his hotel room with a paid escort, whom he has 
hired for sex. What he really wants, however, is someone to talk to for a few 
minutes while he drinks. Someone who he can fantasize likes him, respects him, 
maybe even admires him. Someone unlike his wife for whom he sees himself as a 
paycheck, a bankroll for shopping sprees. 
</P>
<P>
Persoff captures the reality of that man's loneliness. He makes you feel it 
palpably, like a cloud of tears afloat over his head. He even makes you see 
that invisible girl checking her watch, wondering if the old coot is going to 
get to the business at hand or not. 
</P>
<P>
But Persoff's performance in the rest of this show also reveals the weaknesses 
of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
A more wired performer who could move more swiftly through the fast changes and 
the clever, street-smart dialogue might dazzle the audience into missing the 
repetitiousness of the points made by the script. 
</P>
<P>
What gets hammered home here is that the characters are only superficially 
different from one another. 
</P>
<P>
Some are haves, some are have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
Some escape from life because they are shut out from the good life promised by 
the American dream on television. Heroin and alcohol give them the illusion of 
being powerful and strong. 
</P>
<P>
Some escape because they have the good life and something still feels missing. 
America, lest anyone need be reminded, is not a particularly spiritual place. 
</P>
<P>
But they all sing the same song, albeit in different keys: 
</P>
<P>
"Life is a monkey on my back," explains the junkie in "God Head." 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian's theme is the inverse of Walt Whitman's celebration of life in 
"Leaves of Grass." It's a black vision, with a ring of truth, but it's also 
very narrow. 
</P>
<P>
But should such hollowness really be blamed on America as a country? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Bogosian could stand to drink in more of America. 
</P>
<P>

ROOKIE'S 4 RBIS POWER ANGELS, 9-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Lee Stevens was not quite 3 when Bert Blyleven made his major league pitching 
debut in June of 1970. Stevens has grown up since then, but Blyleven has only 
grown a beard. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens' first major league home run helped Blyleven earn the 279th victory of 
his career Friday, providing the first three runs as the Angels beat the 
Indians, 9-4, at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven (8-5) lasted only five innings, giving up three earned runs and 10 
hits before yielding to Mike Fetters, but it was enough for the Angels' chief 
prankster to get his first victory in five starts since June 21. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, 39, acknowledged that he was lucky to win, but Angel Manager Doug 
Rader was somewhat more charitable. "The bottom line is that the kid won," he 
said, before realizing his error. "Our elderly child. Our aging adolescent, 
however you want to say it." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens acknowledged feeling some awe when he became a teammate of players he 
had always watched from afar. But he showed no respect for a changeup thrown by 
Bud Black (8-5) in the first inning, lining it off the facing of the 
terrace-level seats in right-center field. That ended Black's streak of 23 1/3 
scoreless innings and made Stevens the first left-handed Angel hitter to homer 
off a left-handed pitcher since Wally Joyner did it against Milwaukee's Tony 
Fossas May 27. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of weird playing with players I've seen on TV over the years," said 
Stevens, who drove in a run in the sixth as the Angels scored four runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Going out there and seeing Keith Hernandez (Cleveland's first baseman) 
especially. But once you get out there, you realize you're on the same field 
and you've just got to do your job." 
</P>
<P>
The bullpen did its job in two aspects Friday. First, the relievers coaxed 
Stevens' home run ball away from a fan, who had caught it after Cleveland's 
Mitch Webster retrieved the ricochet and tossed it into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys in the bullpen traded a different ball for it," Stevens said. "I'm 
real happy they did. I'm sure I'll keep it forever." 
</P>
<P>
The bullpen's more traditional role was filled honorably by Fetters, who gave 
up only two hits in four innings to earn his first career save -- in the majors 
or minors -- and the bullpen's first save in 15 games since July 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that, and that makes it great to get my first save and the first in a 
while for the bullpen," Fetters said. "The offense was outstanding, and I felt 
good. My arm strength was there." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens' strength in lining Black's pitch 390 feet was impressive, but Rader 
was equally impressed by the rookie's ability to hit a changeup. "There's no 
way in the world he's looking for that," Rader said of Stevens, who was 
promoted from triple-A Edmonton Monday. "When you're in that kind of position 
physically to hit that pitch, able to handle it, you're pretty well locked in." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the early lead provided by Stevens, the game wasn't a lock for the 
Angels. Cleveland came back with a run in the second on three consecutive 
singles, to which the Angels replied with a run in the bottom of the second on 
Donnie Hill's RBI single. The Indians scored twice in the third to pull to 4-3, 
but Brian Downing's chop-double down the right-field line scored Lance Parrish 
to make the score 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland scored again in the fifth against Blyleven, who failed to go more 
than five innings for the second game in a row. But the Angels got to Black and 
Steve Olin for four in the sixth, an inning highlighted by Parrish's two-run 
double and Stevens' RBI on a fielding error by Hernandez groundout that allowed 
Dave Winfield to score from third. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect a lot out of myself, more than five innings," Blyleven said, "but it 
seemed like the guys picked me up and every time I made a mistake, the offense 
was there to pick me up. . . . When you give up 10 hits in five innings, you 
can't say every pitch was good. I was very fortunate to be on the winning side. 
Mike Fetters really picked me up. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played 20 years and I know there's not too many wins that come this way. 
You have to appreciate them. Very nice. Wins are very hard to get in the big 
leagues. Anybody could lose here but not everybody can win here." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield declined to comment on remarks by New York Yankee owner George 
Steinbrenner during Steinbrenner's testimony before Commissioner Fay Vincent. 
The transcripts of Steinbrenner's remarks were made public this week. Among the 
reasons Steinbrenner said he paid gambler Howard Spira $40,000 was for Spira to 
uncover damaging information about Winfield and the charitable foundation 
Winfield oversaw when he played in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield, who acknowledged that he has read the transcripts, said he would 
release a statement when Vincent issues a ruling. Vincent is expected to 
announce his action, if any, within a week. 
</P>
<P>
Game 93 brought lineup 92 for the Angels, with Johnny Ray hitting seventh and 
Dante Bichette hitting eighth. "Just trying to spread out the offense a little 
bit," Manager Doug Rader said. "I'm trying to figure out a way to play some 
offense for more than just a few innings a game." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are batting .248, tied with Baltimore for the league's lowest. Their 
332 RBIs rank 13th. 
</P>
<P>
Bob McClure threw for 20 minutes and felt excellent, according to trainer Rick 
Smith. The next step for McClure, who has been sidelined all season because of 
a sore left elbow, would be pitching in simulated games or a rehabilitation 
assignment. Smith said infielder Mark McLemore has nearly recovered from a 
sprained right wrist.

LEMOND KEEPS COOL, AWAITS TIME TRIAL

<P>
As most of the cyclists in the Tour de France finished the 114-mile 19th stage 
Friday, they had a look of stoic relief. 
</P>
<P>
Rider after rider wheeled his gleaming, streamlined bicycle away from the 
tree-lined Boulevard de Beaublanc in search of a quiet and cool place to 
recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
Their eyes bulged with fatigue. The hot and humid conditions for the past week 
have drained them of strength they will need for the final two stages. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a hard race today, but I was dying like a dog," said Davis Phinney 
of Boulder, Colo. "I got sick from the heat." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the two cyclists being watched the most looked altogether different. 
</P>
<P>
Claudio Chiappucci, wearing the malliot jaune, or yellow jersey, for the 
seventh successive day, had a wrinkled face. 
</P>
<P>
Greg LeMond, still trailing Chiappucci by five seconds, looked relaxed and 
thoughtful. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good," LeMond said. "I hope the heat takes its toll on the other 
riders." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 156 cyclists remaining in the 77th Tour de France, only Chiappucci and 
LeMond stand a realistic chance to win Sunday on the Champs-Elysee in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The victor will most likely be decided this afternoon when LeMond starts a 
27.9-mile time trial next to Lac de Vassiviere en Limousin at 3:55 p.m. (6:55 
a.m., PDT), three minutes before Chiappucci. 
</P>
<P>
This is the moment the cycling world has been awaiting for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar position last year on the final day of the Tour, LeMond overcame a 
50-second deficit and upset Laurent Fignon of France to score an eight-second 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
In that race, LeMond benefited by using aerodynamically designed triathlon 
handlebars as Fignon opted for traditional road bars. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, LeMond should overcome Chiappucci. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, this unpredictable Tour has left some wondering. . . . 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who has homes at Lake Minnetonka, near Minneapolis, and Korkrijk, 
Belgium, is not taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to arise early today and ride the course. He said he wants to 
familiarize himself with the roads through the gentle, green countryside 
adjacent to the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very bizarre Tour de France," he said, after finishing Friday's stage 
in the same time as Chiappucci. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm cautious. I'm prudent. I want to be sure." 
</P>
<P>
The cautious approaches of the overall leaders made for another uneventful 
stage, which Guido Bontempi of Italy won in 5 hours 16 minutes 4 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Bontempi is a sprinter who won three sprint stages in the 1986 Tour. Thus his 
victory in a longer road race added to the unusual nature of this Tour. 
</P>
<P>
A moment of excitement was provided not by the racers but by yet another 
shepherd demonstration in the Dordogne farmland after Friday's midway point. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the third stage, during which shepherds, protesting low meat prices, 
forced a 54-mile detour, this one was peaceful. A Dutch photographer was 
chased, but the cyclists were unobstructed. 
</P>
<P>
Tour de France security officers are used to these distractions. As the race 
achieves increasing popularity, an assortment of causes organize protests along 
the course. 
</P>
<P>
There was a moment of concern for LeMond when his tire exploded from the high 
pressure and high temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
He averted disaster Wednesday after a flat tire left him more than a minute 
behind Chiappucci by reeling in the leader before the mountain stage ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid of technical problems," LeMond said of today's trial. "The wheel 
blocked because it was very hot. I certainly don't want to lose on a mechanical 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond did stop the verbal sparring with Chiappucci long enough to say, "Yeah, 
I'm worried about him, he's a good rider. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to predict. I don't know if Chiappucci can rise to the occasion." 
</P>
<P>
Finishing second would in itself be remarkable considering that this is 
Chiappucci's second Tour de France in six years of professional racing. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back, Claudio normally would have no possibility in a time trial 
against LeMond," said Giavanni Grazzi, Carrera team doctor. "But he's feeling 
very good now, so he will give it his maximum." 
</P>
<P>
In the last time trial, a 23.6-mile race on July 12, LeMond was nine seconds 
ahead of Chiappucci, who is encouraged by that result. 
</P>
<P>
Tour Notes 
</P>
<P>
Money Talks: Jim Ochowicz, general manager of the 7-Eleven team, said Friday 
the Southland Corp. is going to either drop or reduce its sponsorship next 
year. The team has had an outstanding Tour, holding the yellow jersey for nine 
stages. Canadian Steve Bauer dominated the race in the first week, and teammate 
Andy Hampsten of Boulder, Colo., in ninth place overall, looked strong during 
the mountain stages. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Money Talks II: The Societe du Tour de France restructured its sponsorship 
concept this year to attract a handful of major sponsors. The Tour organizers 
make about $5 million, according to Rupert Guinness of VeloNews. The breakdown: 
$3 million from villages paying to play host to a stage, $4 million to $6 
million for television rights -- ABC is one of a dozen televising the race -- 
and $13 million to $14 million from sponsorship contributions. . . . "It's no 
wonder why some people say the Tour de France should be called the Tour de 
Franc," Guinness writes.

<P>
Two of the best golfers in the world playing on the oldest and most famous golf 
course in the world for the oldest and most prestigious prize in the golf 
world. 
</P>
<P>
That is the prospect for the final two days of the British Open as Greg Norman 
of Australia and Nick Faldo of England go head-to-head over the hallowed 
fairways of the Old Course of the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
Norman and Faldo are deadlocked after 36 holes with record 12-under-par 132 
totals after Norman shot his second successive 66 Friday and Faldo followed a 
few moments later with a 65 to go with his opening 67. They will be paired in 
today's third round. 
</P>
<P>
Both are former British Open champions, Norman having won in 1986 and Faldo in 
1987, and they are 1-2 in the Sony World Rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo has won three of the last 12 major championships, lost another in a 
playoff and missed a U.S. Open playoff last month by one stroke. Norman has 
been the runner-up who has seen Bob Tway steal a PGA and Larry Mize grab a 
Masters from him with last-hole heroics. 
</P>
<P>
Their birdie blitz the past two days has put them four shots ahead of the 
field. Craig Parry, another Australian, and Payne Stewart, the PGA champion and 
leading American, are tied for third place with 68-68 -- 136 scores. 
</P>
<P>
At 137 are an international foursome of Ian Woosnam of Wales, 68-69; James 
Spence of England, 72-65; Nick Price of Zimbabwe, 70-67, and Mike Reid of 
Provo, Utah, 70-67. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate of Simi Valley, Jodie Mudd of Louisville and Peter Jacobsen of 
Portland, Ore., are at 138 with Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain, Sam Torrance of 
Scotland and Anders Sorensen of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
The Norman-Faldo confrontation calls to mind the marquee matchup of Tom Watson 
and Jack Nicklaus at Turnberry, Scotland, in the 1977 British Open. Watson won 
with a final-round 65 to Nicklaus' 66 after each had shot a 65 in the third 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Watson was not so fortunate this year. His one-over-par 145 left him among 
those who missed the lowest cut in British Open annals. It took a one-under-par 
143 to stay in the tournament. Among those sidelined was Arnold Palmer, who 
first played here 30 years ago and had hoped to make the final round after 
shooting a 71 Friday, but his par total barely missed. 
</P>
<P>
Also heading home early are Seve Ballesteros, Curtis Strange and defending 
champion Mark Calcavecchia. 
</P>
<P>
The most sudden departure was that of Scott Hoch, who was two under par going 
to the dreaded Road Hole, No. 17, where he took a nine after hitting one ball 
out of bounds and putting another in the infamous Road bunker. Suddenly, he was 
three over par. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record low cut was two over par, last year at Royal Troon. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sailing along, Greg and I; we're playing well, holing putts and seizing 
opportunities," Faldo said. "It was exciting out there today. We seemed to be 
chasing one another. As soon as one birdie went up on the board, another one 
went up. It was a nice mode to be in." 
</P>
<P>
Norman had a remarkable string in what is known as the Loop, from the seventh 
through the 11th holes at the far end of the course, where he shot 3-2-3-3-3, 
four strokes under par. Only amateur Gene Andrews of Los Angeles has done 
better here, 3-2-3-3-2 in the 1958 British Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
Norman still trailed Faldo by a stroke before making the day's most spectacular 
shot, a 75-yard wedge that hit the green on No. 14, then spun about two feet 
back into the cup for an eagle-three on the 567-yard hole. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I hit it good and I saw it hit the green and spin, but I couldn't see 
it go in the hole," Norman said. "I had an idea, though, from the cheer that 
went up." 
</P>
<P>
Faldo was not as spectacular, clipping off seven birdies without a bogey in his 
usual display of consistency. Faldo shot 18 consecutive pars in the final round 
to win his British Open. 
</P>
<P>
"The best shot I hit was on the 17th when I was in deep grass, 156 yards from 
the hole, and hit a seven-iron just short of the green," Faldo said. "It was 
close enough to putt, about 90 feet, and I was pleased to get down in two 
putts." 
</P>
<P>
Norman said he looked forward to what has all the earmarks of a match-play 
shootout. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely feel I can win this week," he said. "That will be my approach the 
next two days. I feel relaxed and happy with my game and am in a good position 
to win at St. Andrews, which is every golfer's dream. 
</P>
<P>
"Faldo and I grew up together in Europe, basically, and have been matching 
shots since 1977. We know each other very well. It should be interesting, to 
say the least." 
</P>
<P>
Off this year's records, it would appear to be even up. 
</P>
<P>
Norman has won the Doral Ryder and Memorial tournaments on the American PGA 
Tour, plus the Australia Masters in his home country. Faldo has won the Masters 
and lost by a stroke in the U.S. Open and the Volvo PGA championship in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo warned, however: "Greg and I can't spend all our time watching each 
other, because the guys in back know what they have to do, and they'll be loose 
and can come out shooting at the moon. There is a long way to go, and if the 
weather changes, anything could happen. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, when it blows around here, the sea gulls walk." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who wore the green-and-yellow colors of the Green Bay Packers, said he 
felt good about his position with 36 holes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I came over here two weeks ago and played in the Scottish Open to get rid of 
jet lag and get a feeling for the bump-and-run game you need on a links course 
like St. Andrews," he said. "I have been patient and have been in only one 
bunker in two days. That's the secret around here. I feel good about my 
chances."

BARROWMAN RECORD BRINGS WORLD-CLASS STATURE TO OPENING DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hoping for at least one world record Friday to give Goodwill Games II 
credibility as a world-class athletic competition on its opening day, 
organizers were rewarded for their blood, sweat and deficit-spending with 
three. 
</P>
<P>
Because all three records came in the same race at the King County Aquatics 
Center, the impact was somewhat limited. But it was one great race. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Barrowman, a University of Michigan senior from Potomac, Md., won the 
200-meter breaststroke in 2:11.53, bettering the previous record he set last 
August in Tokyo by a staggering 1.36 seconds. No other swimmer had improved the 
record in the event by more than that since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Although they did not challenge Barrowman, Kirk Stackle, a recent University of 
Texas graduate from Penasquitos, Calif., and Sergio Lopez, a Spaniard who 
competes for American University in Washington, also broke the old record of 
2:12.89. They tied for second place in 2:12.24. 
</P>
<P>
Barrowman, 21, said that he was surprised by his time but not by the fact that 
the race produced a world record. He trains with Lopez in Maryland under 
Hungarian Coach Jozsef Nagy and knew from recent workouts that they both were 
ready for a fast swim. Lopez's time earned a European record, a first for a 
Spanish swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
"My friend and I have trained a lot harder than we did last summer," Barrowman 
said. "This is the first time I ever came into a competition not being nervous, 
completely relaxed. Something inside said I knew I was going to swim well and 
don't worry about it. That's very unusual for me. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am very surprised by the time. If somebody had asked me before the race, 
I would have said that we might swim 2:12.88. I would have been happy with 
anything under 2:12. But 2:11.53 is not something I thought was a reality. It 
was more like a dream." 
</P>
<P>
If there was a record to be set on the opening day of the 17-day, 21-sport 
Goodwill Games, organizers anticipated it most likely would come in swimming's 
first event, the 50-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the race's co-favorites, Tom Jager and Matt Biondi, have 
broken the record in the event eight times since 1985, no one who values his 
money would have bet against it. 
</P>
<P>
In 19 meetings at either 50 meters or 50 yards since 1984, Jager, formerly of 
UCLA and now of Tijeras, N.M., had won 13 before Friday. But Biondi, who 
graduated from Cal and now lives in Castro Valley, Calif., won the big one at 
the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. He also won six other medals, five golds. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the sellout crowd of 2,472 were still filing into the new arena between 
Seattle and Tacoma when Jager and Biondi were scheduled to swim. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for some of the late arrivals, there were two false-starts by 
anxious rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"That was their only chance," Biondi said, dismissing East Germany's Nils 
Rudolph's beating both him and Jager this month in Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, Jager had won the last four meetings with Biondi and led in this 
one for about 25 meters. But Biondi overtook him and then held off a late surge 
about 10 meters from the finish to win in 22.10 seconds. Jager was second in 
22.31, well off his world record of 21.81. Rudolph was fourth in 22.61. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi, who has complained because swimmers are not being paid for competing 
here while athletes in some other sports are receiving thousands of dollars, 
valued the victory as an advertisement for the "Dash for Cash" match races that 
he and Jager are staging. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for me and for the sport of swimming that I'm seen as a viable 
contender in the 50," he said. "Tom's been beating me up pretty bad. It's good 
for me and for the sport to know that I can beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Interrupted Jager, "It was all planned." 
</P>
<P>
In the other featured event, the women's 800-meter freestyle, Janet Evans' only 
problem came about 10 meters into the race, when she lost her goggles. She won 
in 8:28.47, and second place Anke Moehring of East Germany swam 8:33.44. 
</P>
<P>
A closer race was expected. Evans, the gold medalist in Seoul, was joined by 
silver medalist Astrid Strauss of East Germany and bronze medalist Julie 
McDonald of Australia. McDonald was fourth and Strauss fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the field might have been faster," said Evans, a Stanford sophomore 
from Placentia. "I kind of hoped it would be more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Biondi and Evans were stars of the U.S. swimming team in Seoul, but Barrowman 
was one of its few disappointments. After setting an American record in the 200 
breaststroke at the U.S. trials in Austin, Tex., he was favored to win at the 
Olympics. But he finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
He said the pain has been eased by the three world records he has set since 
then in the event. But he has not forgotten it. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it continues to haunt me," he said. "If it stops, that means it's time 
to stop swimming. Setting records helps, but I hope it still burns down there."

DUNCAN BATTLES HEAT FOR ONE-SHOT LEAD OVER STANKOWSKI, VOGES 
</P>

<P>
Paul Stankowski of Oxnard and Mitch Voges of Simi Valley had to settle for a 
second-place tie on Friday midway through the 91st Southern California Golf 
Assn. Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
On a day hot enough to wilt a shrub, the only man to play two better rounds 
than they did was a landscape architect. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Duncan, 32, of Rancho Santa Fe put together rounds of 67 and 72 over the 
tight, 6,531-yard Wilshire Country Club course to take the lead. Stankowski, 
20, had rounds of 67 and 73, and Voges, 40, shot 72-68 to trail Duncan by a 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Wi of Thousand Oaks, the 18-year-old who stunned the state's amateur 
golfers a month ago by winning the California Amateur on the Monterey 
Peninsula, struggled in the 100-degree heat. He shot an opening-round 73 and 
then stumbled to a 76. His total of 149 also was the 36-hole cut. He and 31 
others advanced to today's second round. The championship round is Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who did not advance were Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys, who lost to 
Wi in the semifinals of the state championship and was the 1988 SCGA amateur 
champion. He shot rounds of 72 and 80, with a nine on No. 17, a par-four, 
during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski, a junior at Texas El Paso, won the tournament last year at the 
Glendora Country Club. He tied for low medalist honors in this year's state 
amateur tournament before being ousted in match play by Wi. 
</P>
<P>
He said the heat wore him out after his morning-round 67. 
</P>
<P>
"I really felt (it) at the end of the first round," he said. "I was really 
tired. I sat in the shade for an hour between rounds and then didn't even want 
to get up again. Later in the day I think it started to bother me. I lost my 
concentration a little bit and my focus wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski won the Oxnard City championship by eight strokes three weeks ago 
and said he knew he would have to bring his best game into the SCGA tournament 
to win it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a stronger field here than there was for the state amateur," he said. 
"This tournament just has better golfers. I knew I had to bring my A-1 game to 
win this one. And I think I have." 
</P>
<P>
Voges, who plays out of the Wood Ranch Country Club in Simi Valley, finished in 
the top five in last year's SCGA Mid-Amateur Championship and made it to match 
play of the 1990 state amateur.

NEVADA LAS VEGAS PENALTIES;

<P>
SANCTIONS COULD MEAN SHORTFALL FOR BIG WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Playing in a conference with Nevada Las Vegas has always meant a share of the 
spotlight for Big West Conference schools. It has also meant a share of the 
spoils. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the NCAA's announcement Friday barring UNLV's basketball team from 
defending its national championship, Big West schools might also share the 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine finished the past basketball season with a 5-23 record, the worst in 
school history. But when NCAA tournament revenue was distributed, Irvine 
received $73,000, more than $46,000 of which was the result of UNLV reaching 
the NCAA tournament's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
"Vegas has been supporting a lot of teams in the conference over the years," 
said Bill Mulligan, Irvine coach. "This is going to affect a lot of schools." 
</P>
<P>
In a conference in which several schools have annual budget crises, athletic 
departments are likely to feel some financial impact as a result of the NCAA's 
sanctions against UNLV, which involves violations brought forth in 1977. The 
Rebels joined the conference four years later. 
</P>
<P>
Most conference schools plan for NCAA tournament revenue in their budgets, with 
varying degrees of caution. Cal State Fullerton assumes that a Big West school 
or schools will play two NCAA games. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV earned slightly more than $1.4 million for reaching the Final Four this 
year, of which its share was slightly more than $1 million, including NCAA 
revenues earned by UC Santa Barbara and New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
But in what could prove a fortuitous change for Big West schools, the NCAA is 
currently considering a proposal that would change the distribution formula for 
tournament revenues, spreading money more evenly among participating 
conferences, with less emphasis on how long an individual school stays in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, schools received $286,500 for making the tournament, and earned 
additional money for each round they advanced. In most cases, the money was 
shared among their conference members in varying formulas. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed formula calls for distribution based on conference performance in 
the tournament over the previous six years. If passed, it could go into effect 
in time for the 1991 tournament, thereby sparing the Big West some of the 
effects of the UNLV ban. 
</P>
<P>
The Big West is also faced with a dilemma in deciding whether to allow UNLV to 
participate in its postseason tournament, which decides the conference's 
automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
To ban UNLV would almost certainly mean significant financial losses, because 
UNLV fans make up a large part of the attendance. Each conference member earned 
about $12,000 from the Big West tournament last year. This season's tournament 
will be held at the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
But to include UNLV could result in forfeiting the conference's automatic NCAA 
bid, should UNLV win the Big West tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Big West Commissioner Jim Haney said no decision on the conference tournament 
would be made until the appeals process is exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
"Philosophically, I think it's inappropriate to have an institution participate 
in an automatic bid qualifying tournament that is not eligible to participate 
in the tournament," said Ed Carroll, Cal State Fullerton athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
The current NCAA sanctions might not be the end of the Big West's financial 
fallout from UNLV's ongoing involvement with the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Big West schools could feel further financial impact should UNLV be penalized 
as a result of an ongoing NCAA investigation into the recruitment of New York 
city prep star Lloyd Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
If UNLV were barred from appearing on live television, a common penalty, Big 
West schools would no longer receive money from television rights fees, which 
are shared with conference members. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV received $177,000 for playing in nine games televised by ABC, CBS or NBC 
last season. Each conference school received $45,655 of the $900,000 generated 
by those games. A television packager, Creative Sports Marketing Inc., received 
a large portion of the remainder under a contract that gives the packager 50% 
of revenues more than $500,000.

NEVADA LAS VEGAS PENALTIES; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHLAND'S TARVER, O'BANNON STILL HAVE AN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The penalty levied on the Nevada Las Vegas basketball program Friday by the 
NCAA could result in the school losing two of its blue-chip recruits, local 
prep stars Shon Tarver and Ed O'Bannon. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver, of Santa Clara High in Oxnard, and O'Bannon, of Artesia High in 
Lakewood, made verbal commitments in May to attend Nevada Las Vegas. They did 
not, however, sign a national letter of intent, retaining the option to choose 
another school while awaiting the outcome of an NCAA investigation of the 
university's 1987 recruitment of New York prep star Lloyd Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
But the severity of the penalty imposed Friday -- which bans Nevada Las Vegas 
from postseason play for the 1990-91 season -- was unexpected. It dates to NCAA 
violations committed by the school in 1977 and is separate from the allegations 
involving Daniels, the investigation of which was recently completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I really haven't given it (the penalty) a lot of thought or worry, and I 
really have no comment," said Tarver, a 6-foot-5 guard who twice was the state 
Division IV player of the year. "I've signed scholarship papers (with UNLV), 
but nothing that would bind me to the school. 
</P>
<P>
"If the penalty happened, it happened, and I really haven't stressed out on 
what I am going to do next. I will probably talk to Ed, if I can get ahold of 
him." 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon, a 6-foot-8 center-forward who led Artesia to a Southern Section 4-A 
championship and the state Division II title last season, was in Montevideo, 
Uruguay, Friday competing in the Junior World Games. 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA rules, O'Bannon and Tarver could choose another school before they 
enroll and play right away. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not familiar with their particular case, but if they don't have anything 
signed, there is nothing to hold them," said Allen Archer, spokesman for the 
Collegiate Commissioners Assn., which runs the national letter of intent 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Time is a major factor. If sanctions regarding the Daniels investigation are 
handed down by the NCAA after O'Bannon and Tarver have enrolled at UNLV, they 
might not be able to transfer without penalty. That is because their 
eligibility probably would exceed the length of the school's penalties. Once a 
school receives an official list of charges from the NCAA, it has 90 days to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
Before announcing his decision to attend Nevada Las Vegas, O'Bannon had 
narrowed the rest of his list to Arizona State, Syracuse, UCLA and USC. 
Tarver's other candidates had been Georgia Tech, Syracuse and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will have three scholarships available next season; USC will have one and 
Arizona State will have two. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver's father had previously told The Times that both UCLA and Syracuse had 
implied that his son would be welcome at their schools if Nevada Las Vegas was 
penalized by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, they have to continue to recruit to help their programs, so it's 
not certain that they would have a scholarship for him (Shon)," John Tarver 
said. "They implied that they would." 
</P>
<P>
Neither UCLA Coach Jim Harrick nor USC Coach George Raveling could be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Also under NCAA rules, Stacy Augmon and Larry Johnson, both seniors at Nevada 
Las Vegas, could transfer and play immediately at their new schools. However, 
the NBA said that because its draft was held last month, Johnson and Augmon 
will have to wait a year to play in the league.

A more experienced Soviet Union team, behind the powerful hitting of Irina 
Smirnova, routed the United States Friday night in the opening round of women's 
volleyball competition in the Goodwill Games at Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, with five members of their 1988 Olympic gold medal team, won, 
15-5, 15-8, 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier Group B match, Brazil defeated Canada, 15-5, 15-2, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
In a Group A match, China overcame a slow start to defeat Peru in a rematch of 
the teams' 1988 Olympic silver-medal encounter. 
</P>
<P>
China beat Olympic silver-medalist Peru, 15-5, 7-15, 15-13, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
In a second Group A match, Japan defeated Cuba, 12-15, 15-6, 15-8, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
In gymnastics, the world champion Soviet men, as expected, won the team title 
with 176.500 points. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of injured world champion Igor Korobchinski and a sub-par 
effort from Valentin Mogilny, the Soviets led from the opening routine. 
</P>
<P>
Valeri Belenki, Vitali Scherbo and Valeri Lyukin, the only holdover from the 
gold-medal winning 1988 Olympic team, all had solid performances. 
</P>
<P>
The United States overcame a slow start to finish in second at 172.500. China 
was third at 172.350. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Americans' highest finish in international competition since winning 
the gold at the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Bubka, the world record-holder in the pole vault, said he would not 
compete next week because of back problems.

1,860 ARE NOMINEES FOR PACE 
</P>

Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of Los Alamitos Race Course, said 
he has been overwhelmed by the response to the California Cup race for 
3-year-old pacers, which will be run in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,860 nominations with $10 payments were received by the July 15 
deadline, forcing Arnold to increase the estimated purse value for the races in 
1992 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
In advertisements during the last two months, Los Alamitos estimated a purse of 
$350,000 for the open division and $150,000 for the filly division of the 
futurity-style California Cup Pace in 1992. For foals of 1990, the estimates 
for the second California Cup Pace were $500,000 and $200,000, respectively, in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
However, those estimates now appear conservative. "This is totally unreal," 
Arnold said this week. "I never dreamed of numbers in the thousands. There 
isn't a major farm in the United States that didn't nominate. That's how much 
faith they have in California. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most rewarding thing I've seen happen since we took over last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold and Fred Kuebler, director of racing, said nominations have been 
received from 16 states as well as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
AS FRIENDS AND FOES ALIKE HAVE DISCOVERED, PETITE ILE WILL BITE YOU -- ON AND 
OFF TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 4-year-old filly looked as though she wouldn't hurt a horsefly as she stood 
in her stall at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
But when Eddie Gregson, Petite Ile's trainer, patted her head, the filly 
snapped at his hand. Ready for that, Gregson pulled the hand out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
"She'll bite the hell out of you," Gregson said. "She takes her pet nips, and 
she's gotten me and just about everybody else in the barn." 
</P>
<P>
This is no way for a well-bred Irish filly to act, but Gregson can't complain 
as long as Petite Ile doesn't mind those nine-hour van rides to San Francisco 
and keeps piling up victories. 
</P>
<P>
Petite Ile, whose second-generation bloodlines include Nijinsky II on her 
sire's side and Round Table on the maternal side, has won two of three starts 
at Golden Gate Fields and will make her debut in the Southland Monday, closing 
day at Hollywood Park, in the $250,000 Sunset Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunset is 1 1/2 miles on grass and usually is won by males, but Petite Ile 
should find neither the distance nor the race's tradition an obstacle. She won 
at 1 3/4 miles in her sendoff at the Curragh last September, beating males in 
the Irish St. Leger. And June 16, her last start, she beat males in the Golden 
Gate Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"She's some filly," Gregson said. "I've been quoted as saying that she's the 
best horse I've ever had. That's not completely accurate, because I think I 
used qualifiers when I said that, but she's certainly a very good one." 
</P>
<P>
Petite Ile, who runs for Jean-Francois Malle, the older brother of filmmaker 
Louis Malle, wound up in Gregson's barn after she was offered at a Newmarket 
auction last December. When the bidding didn't go as high as expected, she was 
bought back for about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
When Petite Ile arrived in the United States, Gregson's horses were stabled at 
Santa Anita. "She made such a quick adjustment when I got her," Gregson said. 
"I've never had a foreign horse make the adjustment as quickly as she did. 
Santa Anita is not an easy track for a foreign horse to get used to. There's a 
lot of activity there, and all the horses have to go through just one gap (in 
the fence) to get to the track. But all of that didn't seem to bother her at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Gregson began training Petite Ile on dirt because she adapted so easily to a 
surface she's never tried in a race. Petite Ile still works on dirt and Gregson 
might race her on the main track some day, but for now the future holds nothing 
but grass. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she was ready to run, the first race available was the Santa 
Barbara Handicap, but Gregson didn't want to throw her into major competition 
right away. So he vanned her to Golden Gate Fields for a second-place finish, 
and about three weeks later she won there in a prelude to the Golden Gate 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never really had much luck running up North," Gregson said. "It's a long 
van ride for a horse, and then you turn right around the next day and bring 
them back. But she's handled it perfectly. She's a real trooper." 
</P>
<P>
Petite Ile, purchased as a weanling for less than $50,000, was close in all of 
her European races, with three victories, one second and four thirds in eight 
starts. Most of her career has been managed by Emmanuel de Seroux, a bloodstock 
agent with offices in both California and France. De Seroux has worked with 
owners Allen Paulson and Bruce McNall among others and placed such foreign 
horses as Greinton, Trempolino, Frankly Perfect, Claire Marine and Golden 
Pheasant here. 
</P>
<P>
"Petite Ile was a cut below the top fillies over there," De Seroux said. "And 
when she didn't bring enough at Newmarket, we decided to bring her to the 
States. We decided on Eddie to train her because of his training record and 
because I thought he would get along with Mr. Malle, who is a true sportsman." 
</P>
<P>
Malle, a banker who lives in Paris, didn't see any of Petite Ile's races at 
Golden Gate but plans to be at Hollywood Park Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"If she takes to the course Monday, I think she'll run well again," Gregson 
said. "The course here is firmer than it was at Golden Gate. She's not 
especially clever on the turns sometimes. In fact, that might have gotten her 
beat up there the first time, when she didn't handle the second turn that 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Petite Ile is not eligible for the Breeders' Cup, which will be held at Belmont 
Park in October. Gregson would like to run her three more times this year -- in 
the Del Mar Handicap, the Oak Tree Invitational at Santa Anita and the Japan 
Cup in Tokyo. Maybe Petite Ile will quit biting people now that there are no 
more nine-hour van rides in her future. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Possible opponents for Petite Ile in the Sunset are Live the Dream, Mashkour, 
Shotiche, Valdali, Royal Reach, Record Boom and Brisque. . . . Corey Black, who 
has ridden Petite Ile in all three of her American races, will have the mount 
again Monday. . . . Petite Ile earned $227,000 in Europe and already has added 
more than $322,000 in America.

Five 3-year-olds, headed by gelding Stalwart Charger, are entered in Sunday's 
$200,000 Swaps Stakes at 1 1/4 miles. In post-position order, they are Toby 
Jug, Bel Air Paster, Stalwart Charger, Silver Ending and Jovial. . . . Great 
Communicator, the 7-year-old gelding who won the Breeders' Cup Turf in 1988, 
returns from a nine-month rest to run in an allowance race today. He has earned 
$2.8 million, with 13 victories in 50 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Sunday Silence, the tentative field for the Arlington Challenge Cup 
Aug. 4 includes Opening Verse, Beau Genius, Clever Trevor, Mi Selecto, Western 
Playboy and Santangelo.

attacked a parking attendant outside a bar in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, 27, is accused of running over the attendant with his car on May 1, 
Houston Police Dept. spokesman Richard Retz said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he left the club, he got in an altercation with a valet parking attendant 
over his hubcaps," Retz said. 
</P>
<P>
The hubcaps were missing. Sanders allegedly claimed they were stolen while he 
was in the club. Management said they were missing when he arrived, Retz said.

The resignation by Mike Warren, president of Alabama Gas Corp., came in the 
midst of a controversy over membership policies at the all-white Shoal Creek 
Country Club, where the tournament will be held Aug. 9-12. 
</P>
<P>
The founder of Shoal Creek, Hall Thompson, said recently that the club will not

Texas Instruments Inc.: The Dallas-based electronics firm said second-quarter 
net income plunged 89.6% to $11 million, while revenue dipped 2% to $1.592 
billion. The firm said sharply lower prices for semiconductor memories and 
substantially higher start-up costs for new products and capacity were 
primarily responsible for the unfavorable change.

MGM/UA Distributes Shareholder Payment: MGM/UA said it made the $4-per-share

Big beneficiaries included Kirk Kerkorian, who pocketed $180 million from his

receive $21.50 a share. MGM/UA said remaining $17.50 per share is expected to 
be paid on or before Oct. 23, 1990. Pathe's purchase of MGM/UA is far from a 
done deal, however. Pathe President Giancarlo Parretti must still come up with 
$650 million in financing that evaporated when Time Warner Inc. pulled out of 
the deal earlier this month.

Boeing Co. May Sell Canadian Unit: The Seattle-based firm, which has never been

Aerospatiale of France. 
</P>
<P>
The division, based in Downsview, Ontario, builds the Dash 8-series turboprop 
commuter plane. Boeing bought de Havilland from the Canadian government in 
1986, and company executives have since made no secret of their disappointment 
in the subsidiary's performance. The unit employs 5,400. Representatives of 
Aerospatiale and Aeritalia could not be reached for comment.

TAKESHITA SAYS JAPAN WILL HAVE TO OPEN RICE MARKET

Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita says Japan will be unable to avoid 
partly opening its rice market in a world looking for freer trade in 
agriculture, two Japanese newspapers reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be impractical if Japan had to leave GATT (the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade) to keep its rice import ban," Yomiuri Shimbun quoted 
Takeshita as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Shimbun quoted him as saying Japan should encourage rice farmers to raise 
productivity while liberalizing the rice market. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese pay about six times world prices for rice, and the government has come 
under heavy pressure, especially from the United States, to end the import ban. 
</P>
<P>
Japan bans all commercial imports of rice and last year spent $2.1 billion 
subsidizing domestic production.

CHRYSLER EXPLORING SOME EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOS: IN OPENING TALKS WITH ITS UNION WORKERS, THE CAR MAKER ALSO HINTS THAT 
IT MAY WANT TO BE A STRIKE TARGET.

Chrysler Corp. officials, opening negotiations Friday with its union workers, 
said they want "to explore some kind of employee ownership" in the company and 
dropped hints that Chrysler may want the United Auto Workers Union to choose it 
as a strike target. 
</P>
<P>
At the opening of talks with the UAW, Chrysler's chief negotiator, Vice 
President Tony St. John, presented UAW President Owen Bieber with a road map of 
Detroit. "This is a street map of Detroit, and it leads to Chrysler," St. John 
said in an apparent joke. 
</P>
<P>
But it was also the strongest indication to date that Chrysler might want to be 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler also said it is interested in a plan for union employees to receive 
some form of ownership in the company in return for labor concessions. "We 
would like to explore some form of employee ownership," St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler is the third major U.S. auto maker this week to open talks with the 
UAW on a new national labor agreement. The auto maker's labor pact with the 
union, which covers about 63,000 hourly workers, expires Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW traditionally chooses one of the auto makers to be a strike target 
during the course of the talks. The UAW then negotiates an agreement with that 
auto maker, the pattern of which the two other U.S. car makers are expected to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said auto makers sometimes welcome being chosen as the target, because 
it may let them negotiate a deal favorable to themselves and potentially 
harmful to their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
However, the tactic can sometimes backfire because if a snag develops in the 
talks, the targeted auto maker could be subject to a damaging strike. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler has complained that because of high labor costs, it may not be able to 
follow the pattern of an agreement negotiated by its bigger and wealthier U.S. 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., the world's largest auto maker, kicked off its talks with 
the UAW Wednesday on a new three-year labor pact covering about 330,000 active 
and laid-off workers. 
</P>
<P>
GM's overall stance is in keeping with the anticipated approach of the other 
auto makers, which are demanding greater flexibility to keep costs down in the 
face of tough Japanese competition. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese auto makers have built a major manufacturing presence in the United 
States, and now control a record 28% of the American car market, up from 24% 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three auto makers, which also includes Ford Motor Co., complain that 
pension and health-care costs for their workers are higher than those for the 
younger and healthier workers employed at Japanese-owned U.S. auto plants. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW has vowed that it will work with the auto makers on health care and 
says adopting a national health-care system would be the ultimate solution. 
</P>
<P>
The union, battered by widespread layoffs, is expected to push for a tightening 
of the contract language over the closing of plants. The UAW has accused the 
auto makers of exploiting the present contract to close plants. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three auto makers will be negotiating pacts covering about 500,000 
active and laid-off UAW members.

WELLS FARGO TO BUY ANAHEIM BANK COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wells Fargo &amp; Co., continuing its yearlong bank-buying spree, has agreed to 
pay at least $48 million to purchase an Anaheim bank holding company and its 
two units, Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa and El Camino Bank in Anaheim, officials 
of both companies said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price of Citizens Holdings could go up to $50.5 million by the 
time banking regulators approve the deal and the transaction is concluded -- 
possibly by December -- under a provision that would reward the owners for 
continued good financial results. 
</P>
<P>
"These have been wonderful banks, and we've been successful in them. They have 
had very good management," said Robert Katz, chairman and chief executive of 
Citizens Holdings. "While we had other suitors, we felt that Wells was the 
strongest and best choice for providing service to our customers and support to 
our people." 
</P>
<P>
Wells has agreed to offer jobs to all of about 200 employees at the two banks, 
which have a total of six branches and combined assets of $264.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The branches -- three at each bank -- are "in very nice locations," said Liam 
McGee, executive vice president and head of Wells Fargo Bank's Southern 
California branch network. The offices will be added to Wells Fargo's 39 other 
branches in the county. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based Wells, which only Tuesday agreed to buy ailing Great 
American Bank's 130 California branches for $492 million, has been increasing 
its presence in Southern California. In the last year, the bank has acquired 
two other Southern California banks, along with a Bakersfield operation and a 
Northern California institution.

ARCHITECT FOR NEWPORT'S ART MUSEUM FIRED; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN: THE BOARD VOTED TO HIRE NEW YORK'S KOHN PEDERSEN TO PLAN AN ELABORATE 
EXPANSION.

The Newport Harbor Art Museum has dumped renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano 
as designer of its new $30-million expanded building and plans to hire the 
prominent New York architecture firm of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates to take 
Piano's place, museum officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's board voted "overwhelmingly" Wednesday night to switch to Kohn 
Pedersen, board president Thomas H. Nielsen said. The firm's co-founder and 
partner William Pedersen, who will serve as head architect on the project, was 
hired privately by museum trustee Donald L. Bren early this year to develop 
alternatives to Piano's design after some prospective major donors to the 
$50-million overall fund-raising campaign -- which includes a $20-million 
endowment -- complained about the estimated cost and amount of gallery space in 
Piano's design. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen said that Pedersen's alternative, while not expected to save any money, 
would offer greater flexibility in its use of space for galleries and other 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen said he called Piano in Genoa, Italy, on Thursday, but reached only an 
assistant who expressed "disappointment" on Piano's behalf over the museum's 
decision. Attempts by The Times to reach Piano, whose projects include Centre 
Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Menil Collection museum in Houston, were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Piano, who was originally hired for the project in November, 1987, worked to 
modify his plan according to museum trustees' desires, but his structural 
design for the building's roof posed unacceptable "limitations," Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pedersen design involves a series of different buildings to house 
different functions and (has the) ability to change (the function of) these 
buildings to meet different needs," Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee James V. Selna, who has been closely involved in the design 
negotiations, said Pedersen's plan would result in more gallery space -- 
targeted at 40% of the 75,000-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
Kohn Pedersen projects include the recently completed Western Digital building 
in Irvine for the Irvine Co., whose chairman is Bren and vice chairman is 
Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen said Thursday that the company has never designed a museum, though in 
the early 1970s Pedersen assisted architect I.M. Pei in designing the east wing 
of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The museum trustees also voted Wednesday to terminate work with Blurock 
Partnership, the Newport Beach architectural firm that was assisting Piano. 
</P>
<P>
Contracts with both Piano and Blurock have been fully honored to date, Selna 
said, noting that the cost of developing Piano's design totaled about $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy has dogged museum officials' efforts at developing a design for 
their new building, expected to approximately triple the size of the existing 
site. 
</P>
<P>
After learning in January that the museum had temporarily suspended his project 
after 2 1/2 years of work, Piano wrote to the board in March expressing 
surprise and grief about hearing from Pedersen, not the museum, that the 
American architect had been retained to provide alternative designs. 
</P>
<P>
Bren, who pledged 10 acres of the Irvine Co.'s land in Corona del Mar where the 
new museum would be built, has final veto power over major elements of the 
building's design. Some museum insiders said that Bren was personally 
dissatisfied with Piano's plan, and that he engaged in a "power play" by hiring 
Pedersen without prior approval of the full museum board. He has refused to be 
interviewed on the subject, but a senior museum official who requested 
anonymity said Bren took action only after he was approached by the chairman of 
the museum building campaign, David S. Tappan Jr. 
</P>
<P>
(Bren was not present for Wednesday's vote, which caused no trustees to resign 
or potential donors to withdraw their support, Selna said.)

RATING SYSTEM FACES CHALLENGES ON TWO FRONTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The film industry movie-rating system, which was severely criticized on 
Thursday in a 15-page opinion issued by the New York judge presiding over a 
ratings suit, faces two more challenges next week. 
</P>
<P>
Miramax Films said on Friday that it will appeal the decision upholding the X 
rating given to "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!," and a petition signed by such 
notable directors as Francis Coppola and Barry Levinson asking for changes in 
the system will be presented in a Tuesday press conference in front of the MPAA 
building in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, said on Friday 
that virtually everything in New York Supreme Court Judge Charles E. Ramos' 
critique of the rating system "was wrong." Valenti said the judge of the 
trial-level court does not understand the mission of the rating system and 
insisted that no change will be made in the system as long as there is no 
pressure from the parents for whom it was designed. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people complaining about the system are a few distributors and a few 
critics," Valenti said, adding that recent survey data shows that 74% of 
parents polled find the rating system useful in helping them guide their 
children's moviegoing experience. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is for parental responsibility," Valenti said. "The judge 
completely overlooked that." 
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who said in his ruling that Miramax Films had not proven that the MPAA 
"capriciously" gave "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!" an X rating, called the rating 
system censorship and condemned it for being more lenient toward violence than 
sexual content. Ramos urged the MPAA to revise the rating system or quit using 
it. Ramos also said that by having lay persons decide on ratings with standards 
designed for the "average American parent," the MPAA doesn't take into account 
professional opinion of what is harmful to children. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants us to put psychiatrists and psychologists on the board," Valenti 
said. "We deliberately keep them off simply because . . . any kind of causal 
relationship between what children see in movies and what they do has not been 
established in any known study." 
</P>
<P>
Miramax executive vice president Russell Schwartz said that "all indications 
are that the company will pursue a legal appeal," but said he must first talk 
with the film's director Pedro Almodovar and attorneys next week. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was brought against the MPAA in New York after the X rating given to 
"Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!" was unsuccessfully appealed in April. In the suit, 
Miramax charged the MPAA with violating Article 78 of New York civil law which 
prohibits "capricious or arbitrary" standards from being applied by public or 
private organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos ruled that Miramax failed to prove that assertion and said it would be 
wrong to give "Tie Me Up!" the R rating Miramax wanted when even the filmmakers 
agreed it was aimed for adult audiences. But in his opinion, he agreed with 
critics who say the ratings create "clear and severe" economic impact on 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz claimed there are several behind-the-scene efforts being launched in 
the film industry to initiate a change in the ratings system and said he has 
received a lot of support from other filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gone way beyond just Miramax versus the MPAA," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A New York-based distributor of an X-rated film announced that it will hold a 
press conference Tuesday to present its petition asking the MPAA to institute 
an A rating for adult-themed films, in addition to the X, which has become 
associated with pornography. 
</P>
<P>
The distributor, Silverlight Entertainment, is distributing Wayne Wang's "Life 
is Cheap . . . but Toilet Paper is Expensive," which was rated X earlier this 
month by the MPAA. Silverlight is appealing that rating through the MPAA. 
</P>
<P>
Silverlight President Mark Lipsky said the petition has been signed so far by 
Francis Coppola, Jonathan Demme, Jim Jarmusch, Ron Howard, Spike Lee, Barry 
Levinson, Penny Marshall, Paul Mazursky, Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner, John Sayles 
and John Schlesinger, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Theaters' vice president of advertising and public relations Milton 
Moritz, said his company "really has not had too much feedback from the public 
against the system." 
</P>
<P>
Studio executives and other theater chains did not respond to requests for 
comment.

ROCKER MOUNTS A FAREWELL CONCERT AT THE BERLIN WALL; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVISM: ROGER WATERS, KNOWN FOR HIS 1979 OPUS "THE WALL," PERFORMS THE WORK 
TODAY AT THE SITE OF THE FALLEN COLD WAR BARRIER.

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organizers call it the largest, most ambitious live musical event ever staged. 
</P>
<P>
Size aside, it's easily among the more unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Before an expected live audience of 180,000 and an estimated 1 billion 
television viewers worldwide, former Pink Floyd leader Roger Waters will 
perform tonight one final, very special performance of "The Wall." 
</P>
<P>
The place: an area in the heart of Berlin that until last November was a 
barren, heavily mined and fortified death strip behind the real wall that 
helped divide East from West for the better part of three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Among those performing: the Soviet forces' marching band. That's right. The Red 
Army. On stage. At a Roger Waters gig. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: charity, the start of a fund known as the Memorial Fund for 
Disaster Relief. The aim is to raise 500 million sterling ($875 million) over 
the next six years, 5 (about $8.75) for each of the estimated 100 million lives 
lost in major wars in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Such a fund could yield $80 million a year in interest, to be dispersed as 
immediate, no-strings-attached relief assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Waters, the event's prime mover, is someone with such an 
anti-Establishment image, a man who is better known for his rage than his 
compassion, is a measure of rock's growing social conscience. First felt 
globally with Bob Geldof's 1985 transatlantic Live Aid concert for African 
famine relief, this activism was seen most recently at the Nelson Mandela 
International Tribute in London in April. Both reached an audience of 
approximately 1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But Waters' involvement in such an event isn't as strange as it might seem. 
</P>
<P>
Ray White, a New York City disc jockey who knows Waters well, notes that the 
47-year-old star has never forgotten the reach and impact of the Live Aid 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
"He was elated that for once the kids had wrestled the satellites away from the 
bureaucrats and the corporations," White said. "He kept asking why the 
satellites couldn't be used for the people more often." 
</P>
<P>
The location is also the ideal backdrop for the theatrical extravaganza Pink 
Floyd performed 29 times between February 1980 and June 1981. The real wall, 
which until last November imprisoned an entire nation, 16 million East Germans, 
symbolizes on a grander scale the alienation, futility and nihilism inherent in 
the personal barriers people build around themselves, barriers Waters addressed 
in 1979's "The Wall." 
</P>
<P>
The combination of the chance to perform "The Wall" for a global audience and 
for a worthy cause at such a site is apparently what persuaded Waters to put 
aside his dislike for stadium concerts and do it one last time. 
</P>
<P>
The idea came to him a couple of years ago, and he thought of it mostly in jest 
rather than believing that it might actually be brought off. 
</P>
<P>
In response to continuous pressure to do the "The Wall" again, Waters countered 
jokingly that he'd do it one more time -- but only at the Berlin Wall, if they 
ever tore it down. 
</P>
<P>
Last Nov. 9, they did just that. As Germans east and west danced atop the 
barrier that had kept them apart for so long, Waters began to plan. Since then, 
events have moved so fast that concert organizers have had to persuade East 
German authorities to leave at least one piece of the wall standing at the site 
of the concert. 
</P>
<P>
At Berlin's Potsdamer Platz, the old city hub that the Cold War turned into a 
free-fire zone, the sole remaining evidence of the wall has been reduced to a 
stage prop. 
</P>
<P>
For a city that thought it had seen everything in the heady months after the 
collapse of communism in East Europe, huge sets rising in the former death 
strip -- including a new, 60-foot plastic foam wall, only 600 feet long but 4 
1/2 times the height of the actual Berlin Wall -- all for a rock concert, is 
just one more wonder that has to be seen to be believed. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say the concert fits into the same category. Waters' shows have 
always been known for extravagance, and this one promises to be no exception. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the wall, which rises in the first act and crumbles in the 
finale, props include inflatable puppets the size of six-story buildings and 
British army helicopters sweeping low over the crowd. Plans to have two World 
War II bombers buzz the audience had to be scrapped for safety reasons, 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
The sets and art design are being handled by Fisher Park, the company that 
created the original production and, more recently, handled the Rolling Stones' 
Urban Jungle tour, Tina Turner's Private Dancer show and the Nelson Mandela 
event. 
</P>
<P>
The concert will be beamed live to 35 countries and taped for broadcast in 
another 10. Americans will likely see it on a network in September. But they 
will hear it live on 175 radio stations, according to Kevin Wall, chief 
executive officer of Radio Vision International, which is handling 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said Waters and the 10-piece Bleeding Heart Band, which includes 
guitarist Andy Fairweather Low, have been rehearsing for over two months. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting cast runs from Sinead O'Connor, Cyndi Lauper, Jerry Hall, 
Marianne Faithfull, Joni Mitchell and Albert Finney to the East Berlin Radio 
Choir and the Marching Band of the Combined Soviet Forces in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Participation by the military from both East and West is part of a message of 
reconciliation implicit in the charity's goal. 
</P>
<P>
But there is also a closer, intensely personal link that binds Waters and the 
remarkable man who conceived the charity, a retired Royal Air Force pilot named 
Leonard Cheshire. 
</P>
<P>
Cheshire, the most decorated RAF bomber pilot, was Britain's official observer 
at the atomic bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945. This was the start of his 
conversion to charity work. He has since raised funds to build 265 homes for 
disabled people in 48 different countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Having been blessed with surviving the war, I thought I ought to help build a 
better world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Waters, exposure to the war was less direct but more devastating. He lost 
his father without ever knowing him. 
</P>
<P>
It was the concert's producer, Mick Worwood, who brought together the aging war 
veteran with an idea and the smoldering rock star who decided to make it 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, it happens.

The chemistry of a play changes from production to production. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Tambor's lucid, gritty staging of "Burn This" at the Skylight Theatre 
illuminates this process. 
</P>
<P>
The original staging of Lanford Wilson's play was energized by the lightning 
flashes of John Malkovich's performance as Pale, the hot-under-the-blue-collar 
brother of a recently deceased gay dancer. 
</P>
<P>
Without that stunning overload of charismatic power, the play assumes its real 
shape. It's actually a play about the dancer's roommate Anna: a 
dancer-cum-choreographer who finds her professional and personal life shattered 
and reassembled after the dancer's death. The relationships are clearer and the 
inner core of Wilson's drama more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean that Duke Moosekian's Pale is less impressive, just that it's 
more within the framework of the play. It's a many-faceted creation that isn't 
subordinate to, but amplifies Katie Mitchell's Anna. She is completely 
believable as a dancer who realizes that her statements will be better phrased 
as a choreographer and that her desperate loneliness just may find its 
fulfillment in the dangerous and volatile Pale. She realizes Anna's potential 
with crystalline simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
John Cardone gives Anna's third roommate, Larry, a bittersweet tint riddled 
with wry humor. He underlines Larry's own sense of solitude in his duel of 
innuendo with Kevin Kilner, as Anna's solely self-extinguishing current flame. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1816 1/2 N. Vermont Ave., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m., through July 28. 
$12.50. Information: (213) 466-1767.

EXCERPTS FROM THE MIRAMAX VS. MPAA RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following are excerpts from Judge Charles E. Ramos' opinion in dismissing the 
petition brought by Miramax Films and director Pedro Almodovar against the 
Motion Picture Assn. of America and the X rating given to Almodovar's "Tie Me 
Up! Tie Me Down!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Censorship is an anathema to our Constitution and to this Court. The (Motion 
Picture Assn. of America) which created and administers the present rating 
system also proclaims that it is against censorship. However, notwithstanding 
the denials of censorship by the (MPAA), the present system of rating motion 
pictures is an effective form of censorship. It is censorship from within the 
industry rather than imposed from without, but censorship nevertheless. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It is evident that the MPAA standard is to rate films . . . based upon the 
tastes of the Average American Parent (AAP). The stated purpose of the rating 
system is "to provide advance information to enable parents to make judgments 
on movies they wanted their children to see or not to see." As such the MPAA 
rating system is clearly not designed to rate the merits of a film or even to 
advise adults as to which films they may wish to see. 
</P>
<P>
The MPAA's list of cinematic no-nos is predictable: language, violence, nudity, 
drug use and sex. Notably absent is any sensitivity to the offenses suffered by 
women, minorities, the disabled and those who may not share the values of the 
(Average American Parent). 
</P>
<P>
This Court cannot avoid the notion that the standard is reasonable only if one 
agrees with it. This standard, by definition, restricts material not because it 
is harmful, but because it is not average fare. . . . The manner in which the 
MPAA rates all films . . . causes this Court to question the integrity of the 
present rating system. 
</P>
<P>
* An even more substantial concern is the question . . . of whether (the MPAA) 
is adequately meeting the needs of America's children in film rating. . . . An 
often leveled criticism of the MPAA is that violence in films is condoned to a 
far greater extent than displays of sexual activity. Without professional 
guidance or input it may well be that the interests of children are not 
adequately protected or are even endangered by providing color of acceptability 
to extremely violent and psychologically damaging films. 
</P>
<P>
. . the inference of concern for the welfare of children is not borne out by 
any scrutiny of the standard and the guidance given to the rating board 
members. The standard is not scientific. There are no physicians, child 
psychiatrists or child care professionals on the board, nor is any professional 
guidance sought to advise the board members regarding any relative harm to 
minor children. No effort is made to professionally advise the board members on 
the impact of a depiction of violent rape on the one hand and an act of love on 
the other, nor is any distinction made between levels of violence. 
</P>
<P>
It may well be that the MPAA ratings are skewed towards permitting film makers 
huge profits pandering to the appetite for films containing "hard violence" and 
"drug use" while neglecting the welfare of children intended to be protected by 
the rating system. . . . reliance upon a non-professional rating board is 
misplaced and that the effort by the MPAA to encourage a more lenient policy 
toward violence is indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the rating system to provide a professional basis leaves only 
the viewing taste of the (Average American Parent), the consumers, as the 
standard. This standard may serve as a basis for a successful marketing 
strategy but may not coincide with the advice child care professionals might 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to our jurisprudence which protects all forms of expression, the 
rating system censors serious films by the force of economic pressure. The MPAA 
requires that American films deal with adult subjects in non-adult terms, or 
face an X rating. 
</P>
<P>
* What is offensive is the unprofessional standard itself, not the manner in 
which the rating board applies it. The standard . . . is a marketing standard, 
a tool to aid in promoting films. 
</P>
<P>
* There are also questions of the good faith of (Miramax and Almodovar) in 
instituting this proceeding . . . The allegations of economic prejudice and 
discrimination are unsubstantiated and the exploitation of the X rating by the 
petitioners in their advertising and their refusal to cooperate in the review 
process until after they had physical possession of the X certificate leads to 
the inference that this proceeding may be just publicity for (the movie). 
</P>
<P>
. . . in view of the dominant and preemptive role played by the MPAA in the 
film industry there is an obligation to administer the system fairly and with a 
foundation that is rationally based. This proceeding has raised certain issues 
which need be addressed (by the MPAA) . . . The initial problem is the need to 
avoid stigmatizing films of an adult nature, which ought not be seen by 
children, but which are clearly not pornographic. The MPAA, having acquiesced 
in the use of the X rating by the pornography industry, may well have some 
affirmative responsibility to avoid stigmatizing films with an X rating. 
</P>
<P>
. . . the rating system's categories have been fashioned by the motion picture 
industry to create an illusion of concern for children, imposing censorship, 
yet all the while facilitating the marketing of exploitive and violent films 
with an industry seal of approval.

NEWPORT'S REJECTION OF AN ARCHITECT'S VISION; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN: THE CHOICE OF AVANT-GARDIST RENZO PIANO TO SHAPE THE NEWPORT HARBOR ART 
MUSEUM WAS HAILED IN 1988. THEN HE WAS REPLACED BY A N.Y. FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In October, 1988, when noted Italian avant-garde architect Renzo Piano was 
chosen to design the proposed Newport Harbor Art Museum, the museum's reception 
was enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
M. Rogue Hemley, then-chairman of the museum board (now chair of the museum's 
building campaign), said the Genoa-born architect was chosen "for his interface 
with technology and architecture. We were impressed with his ability to 
introduce technology with the use of natural light and a very scientific 
approach to architecture." 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, was Piano's design finally rejected by the museum's board? And why 
was the internationally respected architect summarily replaced by the more 
conventional New York-based firm of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates? 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps, when it came right down to it, Piano was just too radical for Newport 
to swallow," suggested Santa Monica architect Michael Rotondi. 
</P>
<P>
Rotondi, dean of the Southern California Institute of Architecture and a 
principal of the avant-garde firm Morphosis, compared Piano's "imaginative 
inventiveness" with KPF's "regressive conventionality, which echoes the ethos 
of the captains of capitalism, such as Irvine Co. Chairman Donald Bren, the 
major power on the museum's board of trustees." 
</P>
<P>
Co-designer of the Pompidou Center in Paris and architect of the acclaimed 
Menil Museum in Houston, Piano was awarded the prestigious 1989 Gold Medal by 
the Royal Institute of British Architects. He runs studio-offices in Genoa and 
Paris, and his current commissions span the globe. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates emerged as one of the leading 
commercial architectural practices in the United States. Capitalizing on the 
new corporate fashion for Postmodern high-rise office complexes, KPF added to 
the skylines of many cities. In Los Angeles the firm designed the 
much-criticized Coast Saving Building on Wilshire Boulevard -- a funnel-shaped 
profile that looms over the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bren who first turned to KPF partner William Pedersen for an alternative 
to Piano's inventive design for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Bren offered to pay Pedersen to prepare an alternative design out of his own 
pocket in the second half of 1989," said museum trustee James V. Selna. "This 
was in response to the board's concern that a cost analysis revealed that 
Piano's design was beyond our budget, plus a feeling that the concept was too 
inflexible for our needs." 
</P>
<P>
Piano was asked to revise his design, which Selna admitted the Genoa-based 
architect was "very willing to do." At the same time -- and without informing 
Piano that he was now in virtual competition with KPF -- Bren was paying 
Pedersen to come up with a scheme the board could compare with the original. 
Pedersen informed Piano in March of his alternative plans. 
</P>
<P>
Architects are all-too-often replaced in mid-stream, Rotondi declared. 
Describing a recent occasion in which Morphosis was replaced by more 
conventional architects in the design of the proposed expansion of Princeton's 
School of Philosophy, he said, "Conservative forces on the Princeton building 
committee were unhappy with our concept, so they dismissed us after we'd done a 
lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
"Architects get (mistreated) in this or similar fashion all the time," said 
Hollywood architect Barton Myers, who says he has several times lost out on 
major commissions after putting in a great deal of time and effort. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between an architect and his client is like a marriage, Myers 
said. "Sometimes you find you got into bed with the wrong person. What matters 
then is how gracefully the partners extricate themselves from this awkward and 
embarrassing situation." 
</P>
<P>
Both Myers and Rotondi, along with several other architects interviewed, 
rejected the museum's public statement that Piano was dismissed because his 
design was inflexible. The professionals labled it a "lame excuse" and their 
comments ranged from "cowardly" to "outright hogwash." 
</P>
<P>
Piano has been unavailable for reaction, but his comments from an April, 1989, 
interview with The Times serve as an appropriate response to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"Memory is the basis of all architecture," he said. "Not as sentimental 
nostalgias for a mythical past . . . but as a treasure house of shared 
experiences architecture may spend to enrich its language."

POP BEAT / WORLD BEAT: MANO NEGRA: VIVE LE ROCK

It's generally been considered an irrefutable law of nature that the French 
can't rock 'n' roll. Well, pardonez moi, but Paris' Mano Negra rocked so 
impressively Thursday at the Roxy that the group may need a new law unto 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Some have called the band the French Clash, others the Gallic Chili Peppers. 
Neither comparison is really accurate, but they hint at the boisterous, 
neo-vaudevillian stage attitude of the eight-piece band -- which did Bobby 
Fuller's "I Fought the Law," a song the Clash used to perform. 
</P>
<P>
Mano Negra represents a clash of another kind -- the culture-clash 
cross-pollination that has made Paris a particularly fertile musical ground. 
Like it's folkier Parisian confreres in Les Negresse Vertes, Mano Negra blends 
elements of several Mediterranean cultures (the group sings in French, Spanish, 
English and Arabic) in a frenetic, kinetic, horn-and-guitars spiked musical 
style best termed punk-world beat. Not insignificant in the mix is a rap-metal 
hybrid (a la Holland's Urban Dance Squad) -- the band even rapped a version of 
the country-skiffle standard "Rock Island Line." Vive le rock 'n' roll! STEVE

POP BEAT / WORLD BEAT: N'DOUR SHOWS THE WEALTH OF AFRICA IN HIS SONG; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE HIGH-PROFILE SENEGALESE SINGER WILL APPEAR IN CONCERT AT IRVINE 
MEADOWS AMPHITHEATRE ON SUNDAY.

<P>
Ladysmith Black Mambazo isn't the only African artist making big strides toward 
escaping cult status. 
</P>
<P>
Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour, who appears with his 11-piece band in a free 
concert at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on Sunday, received widespread exposure 
to Western audiences through his collaborations with Peter Gabriel. N'Dour also 
got a big visibility boost when he participated in the 1988 Amnesty 
International tour, where he performed with Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen, Tracy 
Chapman and Sting. 
</P>
<P>
Many international artists would be happy with that kind of high profile, but 
N'Dour isn't satisfied with his career progress yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't now achieved what I really want to achieve," he said by phone from 
his home in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. N'Dour, 30, was enjoying a short 
break with his two children after finishing work on his third Virgin album, 
"Set," which is due to be released in September. 
</P>
<P>
"My career has to be made little by little, by experience, and now I'm feeling 
stronger and more sure of myself," he continued, speaking in French with his 
sister Nigone serving as interpreter. "I know someday I will get what I want." 
</P>
<P>
"I want people to know that Africa has its own culture, because American people 
used to think that everything that comes from Africa is from the bush. But 
African people have some new ideas, and I want my music to show people the 
wealth of Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Born into a musical family, N'Dour was the leading force in a wave of younger 
bands -- including Toure Kunda and Super Diamono -- that ushered in a new era 
in Senegalese pop music during the late '70s. The mbalax style (pronounced 
MAH-la and meaning "rhythmic accompaniment") melded modal Islamic singing and 
lyrics sung in the Wolof language with indigenous rhythms and the Latin music 
that was an integral influence on early Senegalese (and most West African) pop. 
</P>
<P>
N'Dour moved to Paris in the mid-'80s and recorded a series of albums, 
highlighted by "Immigres," a 1984 release that became his first record for a 
major Western pop label when Virgin reissued it here in 1988. By then, N'Dour 
had worked with Herbie Hancock and sung a duet with Gabriel on the latter's 
1986 breakthrough album, "So." He and Gabriel continued their collaboration 
last year when he co-wrote and sang a song with N'Dour on the Senegalese 
artist's "The Lion" album. 
</P>
<P>
That album found N'Dour relying too much on slick Euro-pop touches, but he said 
the new album would take a different slant. He was optimistic over his future 
prospects as American audiences become more aware of the range of styles in 
African music. 
</P>
<P>
"A long time ago, what we were playing in Dakar was different from what we were 
playing in the U.S.A.," said N'Dour, who has moved back to the Senegalese city. 
"But nowadays we are playing the same thing because I realized that what people 
like here in Dakar, people in New York love it. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything you see in New York you can see here in Dakar, and my music is just 
like that. I'm an open-minded person -- I can get the inspiration to write a 
song from anywhere -- but I will never throw away my culture." DON SNOWDEN

SHOSTAKOVICH QUARTET MAKES LOCAL DEBUT AT SCHOENBERG HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As debuts go, the concert Thursday evening was certainly little noted. 
Accountant's conventions open with greater fanfare than greeted the 
Shostakovich Quartet. One could easily imagine that Moscow's finest had 
hitchhiked into town, instead of arriving on their first U.S. tour, sponsored 
by the prestigious Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival. 
</P>
<P>
But it will certainly be long remembered by the happy few in attendence at 
Schoenberg Hall, UCLA. The rest of you get another chance tonight, when the 
ensemble plays a second program. 
</P>
<P>
The Shostakovich Quartet has a suave, versatile sound all its own, generally 
dark and soft-grained. It is capable of gruff muttering and heroic outbursts, 
of affecting song and taut discourse, all delivered with complete unanimity, 
well-blended and balanced but utterly transparent in texture. 
</P>
<P>
Violinists Andrei Shishlov and Sergei Pishchugin, violist Alexander Galkovsky 
and cellist Alexander Korchagin brought with them big, unhackneyed programs of 
Russian music -- most refreshing and stimulating in a season dominated by light 
and/or familiar repertory. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece Thursday was the Quartet No. 4, Opus 49, by Vasili Lobanov, a 
Moscow colleague. It proved a discursive but formally rounded epic, tense and 
angry but also revealing flashes of ironic wit. 
</P>
<P>
Lobanov's style is undogmatically expressive, rooted in Shostakovich and 
Bartok. For all the emotional vehemence and coloristic bravura of the piece, 
his quartet is built on a single step-wise gesture, sometimes shrunk through 
microtonal inflections, sometimes displaced over octaves, chordally amplified 
or linked in melodic chains, but an obsessive, concentrating presence. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble played the draining work with unflagging energy and stern, often 
savage, authority. They take risks, but proved understandably well-versed in 
the manifold challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the ancestry of the Lobanov work could be heard in the rarely 
performed, remarkably forward-looking Quartet No. 1 by Borodin. The Scherzo, 
with its slashing vigor and stunning Trio in harmonics, and the Andante with 
its subtle modal variations and glorious part-writing, connected strongly with 
the rest of the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The Shostakovans began with their namesake's Fourth Quartet, in a flowing 
reading that started in sonorous lyricism and grew into an intense debate. The 
deeply serious, slightly abstracted performance explored layers of subtexts 
while maintaining a placidly austere surface. 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing austere about the encore, however. The now beaming musicians 
returned with Shostakovich's "Age of Gold" Polka, in a gleefully hammy, 
sardonically explosive account. JOHN HENKEN

PHILIP GLASS AND TANIA LEON OPEN 1990 CABRILLO FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA

<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA CRUZ 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Between the 27th Cabrillo Music Festival and the 28th, which began here on 
Thursday night, a major historical event intervened. It was, of course, the 
devastating earthquake of Oct. 17. Still recovering and busily rebuilding, 
Santa Cruz will never be the same, many of the locals say. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, however, goes on. As longtime music director Dennis Russell 
Davies said at the Prelude Concert in First Congregational Church, "We're still 
here," and the 1990 festival -- 12 concerts in and around the beachfront 
community through July 29 -- promises a rich continuation, in Davies' 17th 
summer, of the Cabrillo traditions first established by founder-conductor 
Gerhard Samuel beginning in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Living composers are the stream from which these traditions flow. In 1990 the 
presence of three composers in residence, Philip Glass, Tania Leon and Lou 
Harrison, give the 28th festival its special character. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural concert began with an unscheduled premiere when Davies sat at the 
piano and played a piece called "Opening," which Glass reportedly wrote this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
It is a seven-minute prelude, in shifting harmonies and steady triplet-figures, 
of Schubertian directness and simplicity. Davies and Glass, the 
conductor-pianist told his audience, dedicate it to the people of Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
More music by Glass, the motoric "Similar Motion" (1969), in a version for four 
electronic keyboards -- played by Emily Wong-George, Brenda Tom, Glass and 
Davies -- concluded the program. 
</P>
<P>
In between, an international and historical stew offered welcome hearings of 
chamber pieces from both ends of this century: Carlos Chavez's "Energia" 
(1925), Silvestre Revueltas' "Homenaje a Federico Garcia-Lorca" (1936), Leon's 
"Parajota Delate" (1988) and the U.S. premiere of Nicolaus Huber's recent "Trio 
mit Stabpandeira." 
</P>
<P>
Davies' revival of the serious, colorful and highly individual music written by 
Chavez and Revueltas before World War II had to be, like so many of Davies' 
programming decisions, tonic and bracing. 
</P>
<P>
Juxtaposing them with Leon's brief and perky birthday tribute to composer Joan 
Tower and the neo-abstract gloominess of Huber's Trio -- written for and 
performed here by Trio Basso, the virtuoso German ensemble of viola, cello and 
double bass -- was brilliant, and ear-opening. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the Prelude Concert has been an extended presentation of musical 
appetizers. In 1990, and with a special sense of history, Davies continued the 
tradition, uninterrupted. In a year of trauma, the message, "We're still here," 
is touching. DANIEL CARIAGA

WATERGATE: THE FACTS VERSUS NIXON LIBRARY 
</P>

<P>
With a heavily edited version of a key White House tape and museum displays 
that avoid many aspects of the scandal, including the criminal convictions of 
several of his senior aides, the new Richard M. Nixon library constitutes the 
former President's most recent effort in a 16-year campaign to reshape the 
public's view of Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
Library officials repeatedly had told reporters in recent days and weeks that 
the tapes presented at the museum would be left unedited. Asked Friday about 
that, library director Hugh Hewitt declined to comment. "That's a museum-design 
question," he said, adding that the building's design had been supervised by 
Nixon's top aide and spokesman, John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Watergate display, which Nixon avoided when he gave President Bush and 
former Presidents Reagan and Ford a tour of the rest of his museum Thursday, 
opened to the public Friday. It consists of three White House tapes, two of 
which will not be available to visitors until September, and a long wall of 
text and photographs describing the events of the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The one tape available to the public now is the so-called "smoking gun" tape of 
July 23, 1972, in which Nixon approved a plan to have the CIA warn the FBI to 
stop its investigation of Watergate. The library version of the tape presents 
only some portions of the conversation, stitched together with a narration that 
offers innocent explanations for what Nixon is heard saying. The tape concludes 
with Nixon reading a diary entry made two weeks later describing later events. 
</P>
<P>
The text displays concede that "Nixon himself has said he made inexcusable 
misjudgments during Watergate" but accuse many of Nixon's critics -- ranging 
from the late Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.), who chaired the Senate's investigation 
of Watergate, to Archibald Cox, the Harvard law professor who served as special 
prosecutor until Nixon fired him -- of "partisan" bias. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and his former colleague Carl Bernstein 
are singled out for special criticism. One display accuses the two, who won a 
Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on Watergate, of "offering bribes, illegally 
gaining access to telephone numbers and talking to members of the grand jury" 
in their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The display puts that accusation in quotes attributed only to an unnamed 
"scholar." The quotation is from a recent book on Watergate by Stanley I. 
Kutler of the University of Wisconsin. Kutler, in an interview Friday, said 
that in the book he did not make the charge himself, but merely had noted that 
others had said it. Woodward, in an interview Friday, denied ever having 
offered bribes. 
</P>
<P>
Kutler said: "Nixon is blaming the media and everyone else for his troubles 
while Watergate was his own doing and that of his aides. The media simply 
reported the investigations of properly constituted legal authorities." 
</P>
<P>
As portrayed in thousands of pages of transcripts from court trials and 
congressional hearings, hundreds of hours of taped White House conversations 
and depositions from scores of witnesses, the scandal which became known as 
"Watergate" was, in fact, two overlapping conspiracies. 
</P>
<P>
The first, begun early in the Nixon term, was a plan to use wiretaps, 
burglaries and surveillance by the FBI, the CIA and independent groups 
organized by White House aides to harass, spy on and punish the President's 
enemies. Members of one of those independent groups, known informally as "the 
plumbers," were arrested on June 17, 1972, as they tried to break into the 
offices of the Democratic national chairman Lawrence O'Brien in Washington's 
Watergate office building. 
</P>
<P>
Before the scandal ended, John D. Ehrlichman, Nixon's top domestic policy 
adviser, G. Gordon Liddy, the general counsel to Nixon's reelection campaign 
and eight others were found guilty of criminal acts connected to that 
conspiracy. The museum contains no mention of that first conspiracy or the 
convictions that flowed from it. 
</P>
<P>
The second conspiracy, which began almost immediately after the Watergate 
arrests, was designed to cover up the first conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlichman, H.R. Haldeman, who was Nixon's chief of staff, Atty. Gen. John N. 
Mitchell and eight others were found guilty of criminal acts in connection with 
that conspiracy. Nixon's own participation in the cover-up effort led the 
Watergate grand jury to name him a "unindicted co-conspirator" on Feb. 29, 
1974, and formed the basis for most of the impeachment charges that the House 
Judiciary Committee approved, 27-11, on July 27, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Related charges involving illegal campaign contributions, tax law violations 
and political "dirty tricks" led to guilty pleas or convictions for 50 other 
individuals and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
As portrayed by the museum's display, the scandal that drove Nixon from office 
is far different, the way the former President has always seen it: "an epic and 
bloody political battle" in which Democrats sought to reverse the "mandate of 
the 1972 election" by forcing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the museum first hear of Watergate during a 27-minute film that 
portrays highlights of Nixon's career. The mention is brief. "The President 
knew nothing about it," a narrator says, referring to the Watergate break-in. 
But, the narrator continues, in the months that followed, "some of his aides" 
became involved in a "cover-up." The film then leaves the subject entirely, 
returning only to say, without further explanation, that "threatened with 
impeachment," Nixon resigned. 
</P>
<P>
The Watergate room itself presents a carefully selected set of facts about the 
scandal. Nixon, the opening display says, "did not pay much attention to" the 
break-in when he first heard of it the next day. That display does not mention 
the fact that Nixon and Haldeman met and discussed the break-in for 20 minutes 
two days later. 
</P>
<P>
The tape of that July 20 discussion was mysteriously erased -- the notorious 18 
1/2-minute gap that became one of Watergate's most notorious incidents. 
According to the museum display, which mentions the gap but does not explain 
which conversation it involved, "experts said the gap could easily have been 
caused by a mechanical malfunction, but the President's opponents wasted no 
time in finding sinister and devious motives." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a team of experts appointed by federal District Judge John J. Sirica 
reported on June 4 that the tape had been erased by hand and that 
"malfunctioning of the recorder" is "conclusively eliminated" as a possible 
cause of the erasures.

STATION BLACKS OUT DORNAN SO POTENTIAL FOE CAN'T ASK EQUAL TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles radio station KFI-AM, which has featured Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove) filling in for nationally syndicated talk-show host Rush 
Limbaugh this week, blacked out Dornan's show Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A KFI spokesman said the station decided to air alternate programming because 
of unanswered questions about whether Barbara Jackson, Dornan's Democratic 
opponent in the Nov. 6 election, might have the right to demand equal time on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson withdrew from the Democratic primary in the 38th Congressional District 
in March, saying that she did not want her campaign to create a conflict with 
her job as an official with Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
But she won the primary anyway. She said then that she would not campaign 
against Dornan and that she did not consider herself a candidate. But her name 
is still slated to appear on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Eisenson, KFI's assistant program director, said the station consulted its 
lawyers earlier in the week about whether Jackson could legally demand equal 
air time under a Federal Communications Commission rule requiring equal access 
for political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers did not answer until Thursday night, after Dornan had been heard on 
more than 240 stations across the country, including KFI (640 AM), for four 
days. On legal advice, station manager George Oliva decided that KFI would not 
air the fifth show, Eisenson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're under the impression that Barbara Jackson is not a bona fide candidate," 
Eisenson said. "But we just wanted to be on the safe side. We don't want to 
violate the FCC equal-time provision." 
</P>
<P>
Eisenson said the KFI switchboard received 50 to 60 calls from listeners who 
were angry or disappointed that Dornan was not on the air -- an unusually high 
number of calls for a programming change. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan told The Times that the equal-time question "never should have been an 
issue" because Jackson is clearly not a candidate. He said it is too bad that 
Los Angeles and Orange County listeners didn't get to hear his most prominent 
caller Friday morning, Vice President Dan Quayle. Earlier shows this week 
featured calls from President Bush and Defense Secretary Richard Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was out of town and could not be reached for comment. But she said 
earlier this week that she was told by the FCC that she was entitled to equal 
time and would like to use it. She added, however, that she was uncertain what 
she would use it for. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenson said Jackson called KFI earlier in the week about the equal-time issue 
but did not demand any air time. 
</P>
<P>
"She just wanted to indicate that she was aware she might be entitled to equal 
time," Eisenson said. "She was very cordial, very nice. She said she'd look 
into it next week." 
</P>
<P>
Eisenson said the station's position is that Jackson does not have the right to 
demand equal time because she is not a genuine candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Milton Gross, chief of the FCC's political branch in Washington, said Friday 
that Jackson met two of the three criteria for receiving equal time by having 
qualified for the ballot and being eligible to hold the office. Whether she 
qualifies on a third point, being an announced candidate, is a bit murkier, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gross said the FCC has never grappled with an issue like the one posed by 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"The only question is, by withdrawing, does this person withdraw the public 
announcement?" Gross said. "We have never answered that question and would have 
to give it some thought. The station is going to have to make a decision. If 
anybody complains, we would take a look at it." 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, television and radio stations must provide equal time to 
opposing candidates whenever a candidate who has qualified for the ballot 
appears recognizably on a broadcast that is not a newscast. The opposing 
candidates must request such time within seven days of the broadcast.

OFFICIALS PRAISE STIFF TERM IN S&amp;L FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sentencing Friday of Janet Faye McKinzie to a 20-year prison term for her 
role in the collapse of North America Savings &amp; Loan brought wide praise 
from thrift regulators and law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie's sentence, which was coupled with an order to repay $14 million 
swindled from the now-defunct Santa Ana thrift, is one of the stiffest 
penalties in the nation for anyone charged with thrift fraud. 
</P>
<P>
She was a consultant to North America, but, as a close associate of the 
S&amp;L's late owner, Duayne D. Christensen, she was the thrift's de facto 
head, regulators had charged. 
</P>
<P>
Comments came from across the country: 
</P>
<P>
"From the evening of Jan. 16, 1987, I have been certain of the mass fraud that 
was committed by Jan McKinzie and (Duayne) Doc Christensen," said William D. 
Davis, commissioner of the state Department of Savings and Loan. Davis acted as 
conservator for the state when it seized the S&amp;L after Christensen's death 
in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Her sentence fits the crime," said William K. Black, counsel for the Office of 
Thrift Supervision's district headquarters in San Francisco. "We're delighted 
the court had the courage to impose a sentence commensurate with the incredible 
scope of criminal conduct at the S&amp;L. I think it sends a very important 
signal deterring people from this kind of conduct in the future." 
</P>
<P>
"Both portions of the sentence are excellent," said Lawrence G. Lawler, special 
agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office. His seven-county district, 
which includes Orange County, is continuing to investigate further allegations 
at North America. 
</P>
<P>
"This represents a dramatic increase in the length of sentences now being 
handed out to these white-collar criminals. It's a reflection of an 
understanding on the part of courts about the public outcry on these financial 
fraud-related cases," said Douglas Tillett, a Justice Department spokesman in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The order to repay $14 million is an "unknown factor," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of money that disappeared from that institution and nobody has 
been able to nail down where it went," he said. "It wouldn't surprise me that 
she would have access to those funds." 
</P>
<P>
Her stiff sentence is also part of a nationwide trend that federal authorities 
are beginning to see in prosecutions of white-collar criminals in the savings 
and loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, we've seen a dramatic increase in the length of sentences," Tillett 
said. Statistics to support the trend, however, were not available Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Data provided by the Justice Department, however, does indicate that the days 
of the slap on the wrist as punishment for fraud are drawing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has won convictions of 211 people in major thrift fraud cases since 
Oct. 1, 1988. Of that total, 153 people have been sentenced so far, and 78% of 
them -- 119 -- sent to prison, Tillett said. 
</P>
<P>
The average jail time is a little more than three years, he said. But he 
estimated that about half the sentences meted out are three- to five-year terms 
and roughly 25% exceed 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
While Black also sees a trend toward heavier sentences of thrift defrauders, he 
said a continuing problem remains -- courts are inconsistent.

METROPOLITAN LEAGUE ALL-STAR GAME; 
</P>
<P>
NORVILLE'S INTENSITY PUTS HIM IN CHARGE ON MOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Norville is so excited about his chance to pitch Sunday in Anaheim Stadium 
that he already is planning his entrance into the Metropolitan League All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Norville, a left-handed pitcher for the Saddleback Cowboys, is a member of the 
all-star team that will play the league-leading Cypress Dawgs after a 1:05 p.m. 
game between the Angels and Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw (San Diego reliever) Craig Lefferts run onto the field the other night," 
Norville said. "And that's all I can think about, how I want to take the field 
like that. I'll be so pumped being on that field." 
</P>
<P>
"He's very intense," Saddleback Coach Jack Hodges said of Norville. "He's the 
kind of guy you like to have around. He always works hard and is a leader on 
the field and on the bench as well." 
</P>
<P>
Norville is 1-1 with two saves this summer for the Cowboys. He has allowed 27 
hits and struck out 20 in 32 innings and has a 2.15 earned-run average as the 
team's closer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really hyper," Norville said. "I love being on the mound late in the game. 
Everything is riding on your shoulders and that's what I want. That's how it 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
Norville is especially enthusiastic these days because it has been two years 
since he last played organized baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Norville was a consistent pitcher at Estancia High School and threw a perfect 
game during his senior season (1987). He went to Golden West College in the 
fall of 1987 but left the team in the fall, partly because of family problems 
but also because he felt he didn't fit in. 
</P>
<P>
Norville, 21, went to Orange Coast in 1989, but things didn't go much better. 
He redshirted the season and remained in the OCC program through last summer. 
He left in August because he said the OCC coaching staff told him he didn't 
have enough talent to make it as a college pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"That gave me a spark to stay with it and prove I could play somewhere," 
Norville said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he had no real plans for the fall and continued as a student at OCC. 
Tony Wren, who had left OCC in the fall to attend Saddleback, asked Norville to 
consider joining him. The program was being rebuilt by first-year coach Hodges, 
who had came to Saddleback from Laguna Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
Norville decided to transfer to Saddleback in the spring. He hadn't been in a 
game for two years, but because of the weight-lifting program he was involved 
in since high school, he quickly worked himself into playing shape. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised how well my arm felt at the start," Norville said. "I was 
stronger than I was in high school." 
</P>
<P>
Norville played a part in half of Saddleback's victories last spring. He was 
4-2 with three saves, as the Gauchos went 14-21. He allowed 46 hits and had 40 
strikeouts in 51 1/3 innings and had a 4.91 ERA mostly as a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the season, when Saddleback's starting pitchers were struggling, 
Norville was moved into the rotation and pitched a four-hitter for a 3-2 
victory over Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great closer," Hodges said. "But the way we were going, it didn't 
matter because by the time we went to Pat, we were already too far behind. So, 
we decided to start him some." 
</P>
<P>
Norville made three more starts, but the stress of pitching nine innings was so 
taxing that he suffered from a sore arm for much of the remainder of the 
season. But still, Norville viewed the season as a success and couldn't wait 
for summer ball. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was looking at the summer schedule I saw that there was an all-star 
game at Anaheim Stadium," Norville said. "I looked at that and said I was going 
to do whatever it takes to get in that game." 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan League Notes 
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in six seasons that Cypress and Coach Scott Pickler have 
played the All-Stars. Noe Najera, a right-hander, will get the start for 
Cypress, but Pickler expects to use most of his staff. Jason Moler, who will be 
a junior at Illinois this fall, led Cypress with a .541 average this summer. 
Moler played at Esperanza High School. . . . The All-Stars will be coached by 
Jim Kale, who coaches the Costa Mesa Guards . . . A scheduling conflict at 
Anaheim Stadium forced the all-star game, originally scheduled for Aug. 5, to 
be moved to this Sunday.

GROUND BREAKING: FULLERTON CITY COUNCILMAN DICK ACKERMAN IS THANKED FOR BACKING

<P>
Heaps of credit and praise were bestowed upon several individuals Friday at Cal 
State Fullerton during a ground-breaking ceremony for the Titan Sports Complex, 
which is scheduled for construction beginning this fall. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton football Coach Gene Murphy thought it was appropriate to single 
out one person, Fullerton City Councilman Dick Ackerman, as the driving force 
behind the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to Dick Ackerman and the City of Fullerton, this thing is a reality," 
said Murphy, who was first promised an on-campus stadium in 1983. "There has 
been other support, but if not for Dick's continual tenacity, this 
ground-breaking ceremony would have never happened." 
</P>
<P>
Ackerman, who has served two separate terms as Fullerton's mayor, was involved 
in the project when it was first discussed in the late 1970s. He developed the 
plan by which the school would use revenue from an on-campus hotel to help pay 
for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
He has been on the sports complex building committee for the past decade and 
has endured numerous setbacks that have delayed the project and several price 
increases that have forced school officials to scale back plans for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"But he never got tired of it," said Buck Johns, an Orange County developer and 
long-time Titan football booster. "He had the kind of vision to see it through. 
He's the man of the hour." 
</P>
<P>
The complex, which is expected to completed for the 1992 football season, will 
include a 10,000-seat, multipurpose stadium that will be used for football and 
soccer, a 1,500-seat baseball stadium, two softball fields, a track, tennis 
courts and a practice field. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow Construction California Ltd.'s low-bid of $7.9 million to build 
the project was approved Tuesday by the Fullerton City Council. Final approval 
of the contract is expected in September when the Cal State University board of 
trustees votes on the selection, and construction is expected to begin shortly 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big moment -- we've been waiting a long time for this," Fullerton 
athletic director Ed Carroll said. "I can't articulate what this means to our 
athletic program. We've accomplished so much with so little in terms of 
facilities, but this will have a positive impact on all of our programs." 
</P>
<P>
Among those in attendance at Friday's ceremony were state senator Edward Royce 
(R-Anaheim), school president Dr. Jewel Plummer Cobb, and Neale Stoner, who was 
athletic director at Fullerton from 1972-79 and is now executive director of 
the California Raisin Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe we started this project back when I was here and Don 
Shields was school president," Stoner said. "I'm surprised it took this long, 
but it's a great shot in the arm for the school and the city. This is 
desperately needed."

CALFED REPORTS FIRST QUARTERLY LOSS IN 8 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE PARENT OF CALIFORNIA FEDERAL BANK BLAMES THE $53-MILLION HIT 
PARTLY ON THE STATE'S WEAKENING COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The parent of California Federal Bank, one of the nation's largest savings and 
loans, reported its first quarterly loss in eight years Friday in another 
indication that problems with commercial real estate loans in California are 
spreading further through the state's banking system. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based CalFed Inc. said it lost $53 million in the second quarter 
because of $78.3 million in additions to loan-loss reserves as well as $13.4 
million in losses on real estate in which it had a direct investment. The 
company earned $19.1 million in the second quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes hard on the heels of news earlier this week that another 
large California S&amp;L company, HomeFed Corp., lost $108 million in the 
second quarter, also because of problems with commercial real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is the last time you're going to see problems with 
commercial real estate in California," said Peter Treadway, analyst for Smith 
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. "I think the market is going to 
provide more unpleasant surprises in the next two years." 
</P>
<P>
The red ink is reminiscent of the losses that some commercial banks in 
California sustained in the mid-1980s when their real estate loans went sour. 
California Federal last lost money in the early 1980s after interest rates 
soared sky high and drenched the entire thrift industry in heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry St. Dennis, chief executive of CalFed, blamed the current problems mainly 
on declining real estate values and an oversupply of commercial real estate. 
CalFed said its problems are occurring in California as well as in Arizona and 
the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
Properties that have gotten into trouble include an apartment building in 
Southern California, an office building near San Francisco, a hotel in Florida 
and a shopping center in South Carolina, company officials say. 
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview, St. Dennis said the California commercial real estate 
market is in the grip of a slow decline that will probably last two years 
before the market rebounds. Downtown Los Angeles, San Diego and suburban San 
Francisco are particularly overbuilt, CalFed officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The losses by CalFed and Home-Fed also reflect a tougher stance by banking 
regulators, who are pushing financial institutions to recognize their problems 
more quickly and accurately. 
</P>
<P>
These losses are "not a surprise to anyone who follows this industry," said 
Allan G. Bortel, financial analyst for Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco. 
"Regulators are taking a very tough stand. CalFed is not alone. They are 
neither the first nor last to be setting up these reserves." 
</P>
<P>
The losses are also another reminder that California's largest savings and 
loans, once regarded as the best-run in the industry, have lost their immunity 
to the problems that have devastated so many of their smaller competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Once-healthy thrifts such as Great American Savings in San Diego and Columbia 
Savings in Beverly Hills have sustained huge losses in recent months and seen 
their long-time chief executives step aside. 
</P>
<P>
About the only large California thrifts that have escaped heavy losses are 
those devoted almost exclusively to single-family mortgage lending, the 
traditional staple of the savings and loan industry. These include World 
Savings and Home Savings of America.

DISTRIBUTORS RAIDING RIVALS' RECORD LABELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having gobbled up most of the independent labels in sight, record companies are 
now trying to increase their market share by finding more music to distribute. 
</P>
<P>
The latest example of the stepped-up competition came this week when IRS 
Records -- just 15 months after entering into a five-year domestic distribution 
deal with MCA Music Group -- jumped ship and signed a long-term manufacturing 
and distribution pact with Capitol Records' sales and distribution arm, CEMA 
Distribution. 
</P>
<P>
The defection occurred six months after CEMA lured another label from MCA, Curb 
Records, and highlights a major realignment in music distribution that is 
taking place amid the increased concentration of the record industry over the 
past decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the whole thing is spiraling out of control," said IRS Records 
President Jay Boberg. Today, "economics and business judgments are smaller 
considerations. Companies are into a maniacal pursuit of (sales) volume and 
market share." 
</P>
<P>
CEMA Vice President David Kronemyer acknowledged that his company has its eye 
out for more distribution deals. 
</P>
<P>
Six large corporations -- Time Warner, Sony, MCA, Thorn EMI, Bertelsmann (which 
includes BMG and RCA) and Philips (which includes Polygram) -- now account for 
93% of the sales of recorded music, according to the Recording Industry Assn. 
of America. Their distribution units typically receive 10% to 25% of an album's 
wholesale price for placing the product in record stores and other retail 
outlets, although many deals also include manufacturing, which can produce 
additional income. 
</P>
<P>
The six major record companies have gobbled up so much business that only about 
a dozen independent distributors remain, compared to more than 20 in the early 
1980s, experts say. And, unlike the past, it seems that no label is too small 
or too controversial for the majors today. 
</P>
<P>
In a deal valued at more than $3 million, for instance, Time Warner's Atlantic 
Records this month agreed to manufacture and distribute Luke Records, which is 
the home of the controversial rap group 2 Live Crew. The company has been 
embroiled in several lawsuits, including one in federal court in Florida that 
resulted in a major obscenity ruling against Luke Records. 
</P>
<P>
Other recent deals include BMG's multimillion-dollar pact in March to 
distribute Windam Hill Records -- formerly handled by A&amp;M Records. 
Meanwhile, Geffen Records will switch to MCA Distribution Corp. next year as a 
result of MCA's $545-million purchase of Geffen in March. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not too many options open to the record companies in terms of 
increasing their market share," said Roger Lifeset, an independent record 
consultant. Major record companies are "absorbing everything at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Independent labels that are not handled by one of the majors must rely on mail 
order or an informal network of regional distributors, such as California 
Record Distributors Inc. in Chatsworth and Lanham, Md.-based Schwartz Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Schwartz, chairman of the Lanham concern, conceded that "the pickings 
for independent distributors have gotten leaner over the years." But he said 
his company, which reported net income of $707,000 on sales of $98 million in 
1989, has managed to survive by expanding its territory as far north as Maine 
and as far south as Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Major companies, however, have the staff and financial clout to distribute 
records to virtually every shopping mall and mom-and-pop store in the country. 
But as they gobble up more music, experts say specialized music can get lost in 
the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
Boberg said IRS Records was on good terms with MCA but left because CEMA 
offered a better financial deal. CEMA will handle all manufacturing and 
distribution for the label starting Sept. 1, and eventually about 52 titles 
released through the IRS distribution deal with MCA will shift to CEMA. But 
under an earlier agreement, IRS' biggest selling act, Fine Young Cannibals, 
will remain with MCA and won't be part of the new distribution deal. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of losing business to competitors, CEMA has been in MCA's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
And CEMA could lose more business as a result of a management shake-up at 
another label it handles, Enigma Records. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say Enigma plans to discontinue its Intima jazz label, as well as its 
independently distributed Restless rock label, following the resignation of 
President Jim Martone earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
John Burns, executive vice president of MCA Distribution Corp., would not 
comment.

WELLS FARGO TO BUY COUNTY BANK HOLDING COMPANY; 
</P>
<P>
ACQUISITION: CITIZENS BANK OF COSTA MESA AND EL CAMINO BANK IN ANAHEIM -- AMONG 
ORANGE COUNTY'S OLDER AND MORE PROFITABLE INSTITUTIONS -- WILL CEASE TO EXIST 
UNDER THE $48-MILLION DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wells Fargo &amp; Co., continuing its yearlong bank buying spree, has agreed to 
pay at least $48 million to buy an Anaheim bank holding company and its two 
units, Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa and El Camino Bank in Anaheim, officials for 
the two parties said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price of Citizens Holdings can go up to $50.5 million by the time 
banking regulators approve the deal and the transaction is concluded, possibly 
by December, under a provision that would reward the owners for continued good 
financial results. 
</P>
<P>
With the sale, two of the county's oldest and more profitable banks will cease 
to exist. 
</P>
<P>
"These have been wonderful banks, and we've been successful in them," said 
Robert Katz, chairman and chief executive of Citizens Holdings. "They have had 
very good management. While we had other suitors, we felt that Wells was the 
strongest and best choice for providing service to our customers and support to 
our people." 
</P>
<P>
Wells has agreed to offer jobs to all of about 200 employees at the banks. The 
banks have six branches, list combined assets of $264.6 million and earned an 
aggregate $4.7 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The relationship with Wells places us with one of the best-managed banks in 
the West," said Paige V. Simpson, chairman of Citizens Bank. "I think customers 
and employees will be well served. Really, it's getting harder and harder for 
smaller banks to compete." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Helstrom, who was hired only last year as president at El Camino, said 
he has not given "a whole lot of thought" to what he'll do next, but he will 
probably look for a top job in an independent bank. 
</P>
<P>
The six branches -- three at each bank -- are "in very nice locations," said 
Liam McGee, executive vice president and head of Wells Fargo Bank's Southern 
California branch network. The offices will be added to Wells Fargo's 39 other 
branches in the county. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based Wells, which only Tuesday agreed to buy ailing Great 
American Bank's 130-branch system statewide, has been increasing its presence 
in Southern California. In the past year, the bank has bought two other 
Southern California banks, along with a Bakersfield operation and a Northern 
California institution. It paid $295.5 million in cash and stock for those 
banks, which had $1.6 billion in total assets. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always been very clear that we want to be larger in Southern California, 
and these banks give us the opportunity to grow in promising markets," McGee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The two county banks also give Wells a chance to expand its efforts to serve 
small businesses. For a major bank with $51.7 billion in assets, Wells Fargo 
has eschewed the centralized process that other major banks have followed in 
pursuing small commercial customers. Wells, McGee said, lets each branch handle 
its own small-business customers. 
</P>
<P>
Both Citizens Bank and El Camino Bank have solid small-business operations, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wells was one of at least six bidders seeking Citizens Holdings. The others 
reportedly included the New York buyout firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; 
Co. and a foreign-led investor group that offered more than Wells did. 
</P>
<P>
"There are other factors to consider besides price," Katz said, including 
Wells' commitment to offer jobs to all employees. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens Holdings was created by Australian industrialist Richard Pratt to 
acquire Citizens Bank in 1986 for $12 million. The firm, owned through seven 
tiers of companies by a trust for Pratt's three children, was designed as a way 
for Pratt to diversify his investments. 
</P>
<P>
At Simpson's urging, Citizens Holdings embarked on an ambitious plan to acquire 
banks from Long Beach to San Diego and to let each operate under separate 
management. With a goal of $1 billion in assets, the company first bought El 
Camino in 1988 for $17.5 million and had deals pending for two more banks when 
federal regulators decided that each bank's capital structure was too heavily 
laden with debt. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the deals killed Simpson's plan and led to Pratt's decision to 
sell the banks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Pratt's making a smart move," said Gerry Findley, a banking consultant 
in Brea who helped put together the original deal. "If you can't do anything 
more to expand, if the government's got you hogtied, it's a good time to get 
out."

Nationwide Health Properties Inc.: The Newport Beach real estate investment

million for the like quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue dropped 12% to $7.8 million from $8.9 million. The company said net 
income and cash flow increased due to reduced interest expense on debt that was 
eliminated through a common stock offering. Nationwide attributed the revenue 
decline to the sale of 26 of its facilities during 1989. For the six-month 
period, earnings rose 64% to $8.2 million from about $5 million in the 
year-earlier period. Revenue declined 13% to $15.4 million from $17.7 million.

Faced with mounting financial losses, owners of Pacific Amphitheatre decided 
this year to curtail their previously heated bidding for star concert 
attractions, according to court documents filed this week in a federal 
antitrust suit aimed at preventing the Pacific from merging with its 
competitor, Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a minor operation this year. We have very few acts," Neil Papiano, a 
Pacific partner, told government lawyers in a deposition filed with the 
antitrust suit. Papiano said that in previous years, the Pacific had engaged in 
escalating bidding wars with Irvine Meadows that pushed performers' fees so 
high that losses were inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
For 1990, Papiano said, he and his partners decided "we would not pay acts when 
we knew without question we were going to lose money. In the past, we have done 
that just because we want to continue to get in the act." 
</P>
<P>
Papiano said it previously was considered important to bring in acts, even at a 
loss, to maintain the Pacific's standing as "a major theater" and a "player" in 
the Orange County concert market. In addition, Papiano said, "in some instances 
we booked soft (rock) acts, very frankly, to show the neighbors we weren't just 
booking hard-rock acts." (The Pacific is fighting a suit by neighbors who have 
complained about excessive noise from concerts.) 
</P>
<P>
But Papiano said he and his main partner, the Nederlander Organization, which 
books the shows at the Pacific, "decided we would try not to give money away 
any more." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Geddes, managing partner of the rival Irvine Meadows, questioned Friday 
whether the Pacific has actually backed off in the bidding for acts. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still putting in their bids, they're just being less effective" in 
landing attractions, Geddes said. "I suppose if I were being less effective, 
I'd want to tell people I wasn't trying as hard." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Pacific has booked a total of 27 concerts for the current concert 
season, according to amphitheater spokeswoman Laura Gold. Last year, considered 
a fallow one for the concert industry nationwide, the Pacific staged 36 shows. 
In 1988, a boom year in the industry, the amphitheater hosted a record 55 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
According to a document supplied by the Pacific Amphitheatre, in 1989, Irvine 
Meadows ticket income totaled $8.3 million, for nearly an 11% share of a 
$76-million Los Angeles-Orange County concert market. The Pacific reported $5.5 
million in ticket sales, for a 7.3% market share. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Meadows has booked a total of 39 shows so far this year, according to 
Matt Curto, the amphitheater's director of operations. Irvine matched the 
Pacific's total of 36 in 1989, and had 45 shows in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony in an unrelated trial over neighboring residents' noise 
complaints, the Pacific lost more than $2 million in 1989, and the amphitheater 
partners have pumped $17 million into the operation to keep it afloat through 
its bitter, seven-year battle with Irvine Meadows. Members of the Irvine 
Meadows partnership also have said in the past that their facility has lost 
money due to the heated bidding for acts. 
</P>
<P>
Those losses were the impetus for the proposed merger between the two 
amphitheaters. But the U.S. Justice Department stepped in Thursday to block the 
merger, contending in its suit that a union of the Pacific and Irvine Meadows 
would turn the Orange County concert market into an illegal monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
After the suit was filed Thursday, the parties involved agreed not to carry out 
the merger and to maintain independent operations at least until Sept. 24, when 
a hearing is scheduled on the Justice Department's request for a preliminary 
injunction to ban the merger as monopolistic. 
</P>
<P>
Under the merger proposal, the Nederlander Organization, which books and 
operates the Pacific, would take control of both venues. Such an arrangement, 
Papiano has said, would make the market more competitive: exclusive booking 
agreements now prevailing at both amphitheaters (Nederlander promotes all shows 
at the Pacific and Avalon Attractions is the sole promoter at Irvine Meadows) 
would be broken, and any promoter would be able to put on shows at either 
facility. The Justice Department suit contends that two amphitheaters under one 
management could result in higher prices for concert tickets, higher expenses 
for promoters, and fewer opportunities for Orange County music fans to see the 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
Donald M. Koll, the Newport Beach developer who holds a controlling interest in 
Irvine Meadows, had agreed to the Pacific's merger overture before the Justice 
Department stepped in, according to court documents. Meanwhile, Geddes, a 
minority partner who opposes the merger, has teamed with record industry 
magnate Irving Azoff in a rival bid to acquire Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
In his deposition, Papiano said that although Koll is losing money at Irvine 
Meadows, Avalon Attractions, the promoter that books the amphitheater, "is 
making a ton of money." Avalon is the leading independent concert promoter in 
Southern California, with revenue of more than $30 million last year, according 
to documents in the suit. The Nederlander Organization, based in New York, is a 
much larger entity that owns theaters and books concerts across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Geddes, who owns half of Avalon Attractions as well as a 25% interest in Irvine 
Meadows, vehemently denied Papiano's contention that Avalon makes money from 
the Irvine-Pacific competition, while the partners who own Irvine Meadows get 
stuck with losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Avalon absolutely does not make money at Irvine Meadows. To suggest that it 
does is uninformed babbling," Geddes said. Despite his interest in both 
companies, Geddes said, Avalon has "an arm's-length deal" with Irvine Meadows 
that requires it to pay rental fees to the facility's owners. 
</P>
<P>
In other documents filed in the antitrust case, booking agents who negotiate 
concert deals for performers said that a merger would lead to deep cuts in 
artists' fees. 
</P>
<P>
"If Irvine Meadows and Pacific Amphitheatre were to combine, the compensation 
to artists could drop by as much as 50%," said Thomas Ross of Creative Artists 
Agency. Ross, filing a statement in opposition of the merger, said that 
"performers have consistently received better deals for playing Pacific 
Amphitheatre or Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre than from almost any other market 
in the country, including Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
According to promoters on both sides of the amphitheater competition, the 
hottest-drawing acts can command guarantees of more than $200,000 for a single 
night.

WALLY GEORGE OBSERVES 7TH YEAR WITH VOLATILE 'HOT SEAT' SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Orange County Nixon-mania continues tonight with a tribute from one of the 
former President's most stalwart supporters, Wally George, on the combative 
talk-show host's seventh anniversary edition of "Hot Seat." 
</P>
<P>
A poster of Nixon, who resigned from office in 1974 in the midst of the 
Watergate scandal, has been a part of the "Hot Seat" set since the show began. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, he's one of our great patriots," George said. "My next favorite 
would be Ronald Reagan of course, if that's a surprise to you." 
</P>
<P>
And what about Watergate? "I've always thought he was railroaded and stampeded 
out of office by the media," offered media commentator George. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's show, which airs at 11 on Anaheim's KDOC-TV, channel 56, will also 
include taped "Hot Seat" highlights. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: a 1983 confrontation with pacifist Blase Bonpane, who tipped over 
George's desk in an incident that drew national media attention. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the show that put us on the map," George said. "I have (since) been 
tabbed by the media as the father of combat talk shows."

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GOOD MOVIES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attention filmmakers and movie industry people: Why I will not pay $7 for a 
movie in 1990: 
</P>
<P>
* The quality of current movies is terrible compared to the pre-VCR days. 
</P>
<P>
* The violence, sex and lack of plot and imagination are appalling. 
</P>
<P>
* Movies should be made for theatergoers, not VCR viewers. Make the movie 
enjoyable the first time. Forget about the after-market VCR profit. Lower your 
ticket prices. It's no bargain paying $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
* Fix up one-screen theaters. Don't tear them down. Multiscreen theaters are 
not fun, and they are small, with no wide-screen effect. 
</P>
<P>
* What has happened to Hollywood? Where are great movies like "South Pacific," 
"To Kill a Mockingbird," "How to Murder Your Wife" and "Butch Cassidy and the 
Sundance Kid"? 
</P>
<P>
* Why are you catering to teen-agers instead of adults? 
</P>
<P>
I can't remember any movies since "Out of Africa," "Peggy Sue Got Married" and 
"The Color Purple" that are worth my time. Please bring back humorous, 
intelligent movies with plots and great moral messages.

<P>
Mike Barrowman of the United States set a world record in the men's 200-meter 
breaststroke Friday at Tacoma, Wash., in a time of 2:11.53. 
</P>
<P>
Barrowman bettered his own record of 2:12.89 set Aug. 20, 1989, at the Pan 
Pacific Games in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Matt Biondi defeated fellow American Tom Jager in the 50-meter 
freestyle for the first gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi, who won five gold medals at the Seoul Olympics two years ago, swam the 
fifth fastest time ever in the 50 in beating his archrival. Biondi won in 22.10 
seconds. Jager was second in 22.31, far off his world record of 21.81. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the seventh time Biondi has beaten Jager in 19 meetings in the 50. 
Vladimir Tkachenko of the Soviet Union was third in 22.57. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's volleyball team overcame a slow start to defeat Peru at 
Spokane, Wash., as the round-robin tournament began with a rematch of the 
teams' 1988 Olympic silver-medal encounter. 
</P>
<P>
In another match, Brazil beat Canada, 15-5, 15-2, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, which won the gold medal at the Olympic Games at Seoul, 
played the United States in a later Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
China won in four games over Olympic silver-medalist Peru, 15-5, 7-15, 15-13 
and 15-7, before a crowd of 1,000 at the 6,216-seat Spokane Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"Seoul was a big game. This was for friendship, so we were not so nervous," 
Chinese player Li Guojun said. "This game was not as tough, but we both could 
have played better." 
</P>
<P>
Peru, with four players from the Olympic squad, suffered from a lack of 
preparation, according to Cenaida Uribe Medina, a player. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the players were playing in Italy and Brazil and unable to practice 
together," she said.

2 DOCUMENTS AT ODDS ON LAGUNA NIGUEL LAND DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
District attorney's investigators are examining contradictory documents that 
raise new questions about whether Laguna Niguel officials approved a 1988 
transaction that deeded 96 acres of potential parkland to a housing developer, 
city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
One is a resolution indicating that the Laguna Niguel Community Services 
District board approved the land deal by a 4-0 vote on Jan. 20, 1988, with 
then-president Patricia Bates absent. 
</P>
<P>
However, minutes of the meeting on file at City Hall indicate that no such 
resolution was discussed or voted on, and that Bates, in fact, was present for 
the entire Jan. 20 session. 
</P>
<P>
And one former board member, listed on the resolution as having approved it, 
said Friday that the vote never occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Something's wrong there!" said Nancy Lewis, who attended roughly half of the 
two-hour board meeting, according to the minutes, including the portion where 
"Ordinances and Resolutions" were discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I do not recall the resolution. I do not see this resolution in the 
minutes," Lewis said during a telephone interview from her home in Westford, 
Mass. "It's not reflected in the minutes and certainly if it were passed, it 
would be reflected in the minutes, don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
The land transaction recently became the focus of a criminal investigation when 
county officials accidentally discovered that the potential parkland was dotted 
with more than 100 new houses. The revelation outraged Laguna Niguel residents 
and has sent county and city officials scrambling to figure out what happened. 
</P>
<P>
The board resolution, a copy of which was obtained Friday, bears the signatures 
of the district's then-vice president, James F. Krembas and then-general 
manager, James S. Mocalis. Both men also signed a subsequent quitclaim deed, 
giving the public land -- with a development value of up to $70 million -- to 
Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd. It now is part of the Marina Hills planned 
community and contains the 100 residences. 
</P>
<P>
Krembas, now a Laguna Niguel city councilman and a key figure in the 
investigation in part because his wife went to work for the developer shortly 
after the land transaction, did not respond to several telephone calls from The 
Times or a written message left at his home. He has previously denied any 
wrongdoing and said that he mistakenly signed the public land deed, thinking 
that it involved another transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Mocalis forcefully denied Friday that he or former board attorney James S. 
Okazaki -- who prepared the resolution, according to city records -- did 
anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that neither Mr. Okazaki nor I was involved in anything that was 
improper," said Mocalis, who, before working in Laguna Niguel was a longtime 
city manager of San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mocalis said he could not specifically recall the resolution, he said 
he is confident that both he and Okazaki acted properly in preparing and 
presenting it for Krembas' signature. 
</P>
<P>
Mocalis also suggested that meeting minutes reviewed by The Times might contain 
errors that were corrected at the following board session. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis, reading from a copy of the Feb. 3, 1988, minutes, said they show 
that she and her colleagues unanimously approved -- without any revision -- the 
Jan. 20 meeting record. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are different minutes around, I'd like to see them," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Okazaki did not return calls from The Times. A secretary at his San Juan 
Capistrano law office told a reporter that he was in Los Angeles for the day 
but would receive the messages in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution in question specifically authorizes Krembas, as board vice 
president, and Mocalis, as the board's chief executive, to give up the public's 
interest in land that had until then been protected from development. The 
resolution declared that the "irrevocable offer" promising the 96 acres was 
"vacated" and that the public "will not be adversely affected" because other 
"more beneficial" land is being offered by the developer in its place. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the other four board members has said repeatedly that they never 
discussed such a transfer and probably would not have approved it. The board, 
now defunct, administered parks and public lands in the area before Laguna 
Niguel incorporated as a city this year. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the resolution was not found when questions first arose 
several months ago about the transfer as a result of the district attorney's 
investigation. It was discovered this week after Bates, who is now the mayor, 
asked the city attorney to brief the City Council in closed session on the 
staff's role in the land transfers. 
</P>
<P>
The council has since voted to formally investigate the actions of Mocalis and 
Okazaki, who has repeatedly said he played no role in preparing the deed and 
had no knowledge of it until the day he was asked to notarize the signatures on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
However, Okazaki billed the board for three hours of legal work done in early 
February, 1988, to research laws governing the transfer of land by a public 
agency, prepare a resolution authorizing the transfer of land to Taylor 
Woodrow, review deeds and oversee their execution, city financial records 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
A bill dated March 1, 1988, from Okazaki to Mocalis indicates that he first 
researched the land transfer on Feb. 2 and spent parts of Feb. 8 and 10 
preparing the authorizing resolution. The following day, Krembas and Mocalis 
signed the deed transferring the 96 acres to Taylor Woodrow and it was 
delivered to a title company on Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of that would seem to be to attempt to comply with certain 
statutory procedures that would govern the transfer of land by a public 
agency," said Laguna Niguel City Atty. Terry Dixon, who is assisting in the 
city's review of the land transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon noted, however, that the deed was prepared 18 days after the board was to 
have considered it and approved it. "They didn't have that resolution in front 
of them to consider," Dixon said. "Without having that in front of them, how 
could they know what it was that ended up being reflected in this document?" 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bates nor Laguna Niguel Councilman Paul Christiansen, who also served 
on the district board, could be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow President Gordon Tippell said he was not surprised to learn that 
such a resolution existed. Tippell has maintained that the development on the 
disputed 96 acres was authorized by county officials and that his firm gave 
parks, ball fields, open space and other public amenities in exchange for the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Tippell has also contended that board members legally approved the land 
transfer during the Jan. 20 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't come as any great surprise that there existed such a document 
because I think they passed what we asked them to pass," Tippell said. "Whether 
or not they understood it, I can't say. It's only up to them to answer. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion they did no wrong in passing it; in fact they did everything 
correctly. They shouldn't be embarrassed by that. They shouldn't be embarrassed 
to admit they approved the quitclaim deed. Unfortunately, they don't seem to be 
able to understand that at the moment."

HOUSE SWAPPING;

TOURISTS TRADE THEIR HOMES FOR CASTLES AROUND THE WORLD

<P>
Strangers living in your neighbors' house? Using their things? Driving their 
cars? Don't sound the alarms just yet. Chances are your neighbors are living in 
the strangers' house, using their things and driving their car. 
</P>
<P>
It's called house swapping or home exchange, and it's emerging as the most 
civilized way to have a low budget vacation anywhere in the world. Europeans 
have been doing it for years, and now Americans are warming up to the idea of 
vacationing rent-free in a thatched English cottage, a French country villa or 
a rooftop apartment in the heart of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is simple enough. Family A wants to vacation where Family B lives; 
Family B wants to vacation where Family A lives. They match up through a home 
exchange service, coordinate travel dates, leave their keys with the neighbors 
and a list of "must-knows" on the kitchen table and off they go to each other's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds great, you say, except for the part about letting perfect strangers have 
the run of your home and your possessions. Exchange fans -- and there are 
plenty in Orange County -- insist that those qualms soon disappear as you get 
to know your exchange family through correspondence. People who exchange, they 
say, are the nicest people in the world. And besides, they add, since you are 
living in their home, you have each other by the throat. 
</P>
<P>
When Sharon and Harold Whatley of Santa Ana decided to try home exchange two 
years ago, Sharon admits, her initial feelings were of trepidation. "But I was 
at the point where I wanted to recarpet my house anyway and do a few other 
things," she says, "so some of the things I might have worried about I didn't 
have to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
Having done it once, she says, she would recommend the experience without 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time you actually do it, you've written back and forth a lot, you've 
exchanged pictures and you've talked on the phone once or twice, so you feel 
you really know these people and you truly have a good feeling about leaving 
your house in their care." 
</P>
<P>
During their two-month European odyssey, the Whatleys swapped houses with 
families in both England and France. The English couple with whom they 
exchanged got on so famously with the Whatleys' next-door neighbors that they 
took several trips with them during their 3-week visit. The Whatleys, 
meanwhile, became such good friends with their English neighbors, with whom 
they shared a passion for gardening, that they hosted them in their home last 
May. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later they welcomed their French exchange partner, Giselle Hyvelde, 
who had not only left them her flat in Paris but had also given them free 
access to her country home in Limoges. They have since been invited to go 
skiing with their former French neighbors as guests in their Alpine chalet. 
</P>
<P>
"You really make friends all round the world," says Whatley. "We've had 
invitations from just about everywhere from people who saw our listing. We had 
one fabulous offer from the island of Majorca. You just don't have enough time 
in one lifetime to take advantage of them all." 
</P>
<P>
Listings in exchange directories can cram an extraordinary amount of 
information about someone's home into two or three lines by using what at first 
glance looks like undecipherable code. But a little practice with the key soon 
reveals that "R Poitiers 12M" means a rural setting near Poitiers, France, 12 
miles from the mountains, and "A as ae cc dk mo uz" means that the 1-story 
house comes with air conditioning, use of a car, country club privileges, a 
photographic darkroom, a microwave oven and a view. Many of the listings also 
include a black-and-white photograph. 
</P>
<P>
Subscribers to such directories pay a fee to have their listing included, or 
for a smaller fee they can simply buy the directory and use it to track down 
desirable exchanges. Vacation Exchange Club, based in Youngtown, Ariz., 
publishes two directories a year with about 6,000 listings of houses and 
apartments for exchange. The cost for both directories is $16 with an 
additional fee of $8.75 if you wish to list your home in one of them.

Intervac, whose offices are located in Tiburon near San Francisco, publishes 
three annual directories with about 7,500 listings in 30 countries. Subscribers 
pay $35 for the three, whether they choose to list or not. 
</P>
<P>
Would-be exchangers in Orange County usually have little trouble finding a 
match. With its appealing climate and coastal location, its proximity to 
world-famous tourist attractions like Disneyland, and the fact that exchange 
houses here invariably come with a car, Orange County is becoming an 
increasingly popular exchange destination, especially for Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
The companies that publish these directories stress that they are strictly a 
listing service and that since subscribers make all their own arrangements they 
are not responsible for the homes listed nor for any problems that may arise 
during an exchange. "But for the most part, if you have taken a few sensible 
precautions, problems are rare," says Lori Horne, one of the two principals of 
Intervac. Horne, a 10-year exchange veteran, is taking her family to Italy on a 
home exchange this month. 
</P>
<P>
Most homeowner and auto insurance policies remain in effect during an exchange, 
so would-be exchangers should ensure that their policies are up to date and 
that home and car exchange is not excluded under the provisions of their 
particular policies. They should also leave clear instructions about unusual 
appliances, hard-to-locate switches and temperamental plants and put away 
anything too valuable to risk being broken. 
</P>
<P>
Damage, however, is very rare and theft is almost unheard of. Most exchangers 
admit to bending over backwards to care for the homes they borrow; indeed, it 
is not unusual for the homeowner to return and find some long-neglected repairs 
have been made by a handy exchange partner. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem, in fact, relates to cancellations. If one exchange partner 
cancels, a family can find itself stranded at peak season with non-refundable 
airline tickets and no hotel reservations, a situation rarely covered by trip 
cancellation insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the basis of most home exchanges is the gentleman's agreement. 
Contracts, even formal written agreements, are rare. "They're just not a good 
idea," says Intervac's Horne. "You end up talking more about the contract than 
trusting each other and talking about what you're going to be doing." 
</P>
<P>
Even first-timers are surprised at how quickly trust -- even kinship -- 
develops between exchange partners as they plan their future arrangements by 
letter, by phone and even by video cassette. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the cost of airline tickets, an exchanger's only investment is the 
directory listing and perhaps a few international phone calls. Once installed 
in their new digs, exchangers need only budget for normal day-to-day living 
expenses, especially if they have the use of a car during their stay. 
</P>
<P>
This can be a boon for families with children, who often find that the high 
cost of hotels and restaurant meals coupled with peak season air fares simply 
puts family vacations out of their reach. 
</P>
<P>
Not all exchangers are families, though. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe in particular, highly educated professional couples with a yen for 
travel are among the most avid home-exchangers, especially teachers and 
university professors who have long vacations, limited economic means and 
unbounded intellectual and cultural curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
It is this thirst for a different kind of travel experience, a desire to get to 
know a culture better by living it, that is at the heart of many home 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted more than just the old tourist route," Whatley says. "When you stay 
in hotels, you just don't meet anyone. We wanted to know what it would be like 
to live in an English family's home. We wanted to see how they did their 
laundry, what they cooked, what their neighbors were like, what their 
neighborhoods were like. And it was the same when we went to France." 
</P>
<P>
Leland Estes of Tustin calls it a better way of visiting a foreign country. A 
European historian with a doctorate degree, Estes received a two-month grant 
from the National Endowment for the Humanities three years ago to research 
documents in the archives of the British Museum. Since it was difficult to find 
a single home exchange in London for the full two months, he coordinated two 
consecutive home exchanges for his family instead. 
</P>
<P>
"You get an entirely different sense of a country during an exchange," he says. 
"Take shopping, for instance. You don't normally shop for groceries when you 
tour abroad. We had to go to small English stores with their odd business 
hours, and we could only buy one day's worth of groceries at a time because the 
ice boxes were so small." 
</P>
<P>
What makes exchanging so wonderful, he says, is "the little things that happen 
that you would normally miss out on if you hadn't made arrangements of this 
sort." 
</P>
<P>
The Estes family's first exchange stop was in the home of local actress Judy 
Bowker and her husband. "We ended up visiting her parents in New Forest," he 
says. Through the second exchange couple, two professors from the North London 
Polytechnic, they were introduced to the local member of Parliament, who took 
the Esteses on a personal tour of the House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has only exchanged once, Estes remains a confirmed exchange-ophile. 
He admits that his beloved garden was not exactly in the shape he hoped it 
would be when he returned, but points out that it would have been in no shape 
at all had it been abandoned for two months. "All in all, you would rather have 
somebody in the house than not," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Even the experience of having the exchange family's radio stolen out of their 
car did not dampen his enthusiasm. After reporting the matter to the local 
police, he phoned his exchange counterparts with the bad news. Their reaction? 
"Just tell our insurance man, and we'll take care of it when we get home." 
</P>
<P>
Home exchange is not for everyone. "I don't recommend it for people seeing a 
country for the first time," notes Carolyn Wood of Newport Beach, who will 
embark on her fourth exchange with husband Thomas this fall. "At first you have 
to savor a little of everything. I'm not sure that it would have worked for us 
when we were younger." 
</P>
<P>
Unabashed Anglophiles, the Woods have totted up stays in a 16th-Century home in 
West Sussex, a tiny hamlet of 500 souls in Suffolk, and a condominium 
overlooking St. Andrews Golf Course near Edinburgh. This year's trip, to the 
Welsh Marshes, was arranged through friends they met two exchanges ago. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Wood calls the modern notion of travel a recipe for physical 
exhaustion. "Traveling from hotel to hotel is very tedious," she says. "Not 
only is it a lot of work to pack and unpack every two days, but you end up 
living like street urchins. All you can do is press your nose up against the 
windows of those beautiful bakeries and wonder what it would be like to shop 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Home exchangers know.

AIR CONDITIONING HAS CHANGED HOMEOWNERS' LIVES; 
</P>
<P>
LIFESTYLE: IT RANKS AS ONE OF AMERICA'S GREAT INVENTIONS, BUT THERE'S MORE TO 
IT THAN JUST FLIPPING A SWITCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It is an event that ranks up there with the Louisiana Purchase, the Battle of 
Vicksburg, and the development of the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
At least it does according to Life magazine, which in 1975 listed the invention 
of air conditioning among the 100 events that most shaped America. 
</P>
<P>
Introduced in 1902 as a way to control humidity in a Brooklyn printing plant, 
air conditioning was the brainchild of Willis Carrier, a Cornell University 
graduate who went on to refine his invention into a compact, practical device 
capable of cooling everything from movie theaters to passenger trains. 
</P>
<P>
Air conditioning changed America forever. 
</P>
<P>
It tamed the hottest climates, making possible the economic and population 
booms of the South and Southwest, and sped the growth of a host of new 
industries dependent on precise climate control. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals, skyscrapers and shopping malls would be unthinkable without it. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps nowhere, however, has air conditioning made so personal an impact upon 
American life than in the home. 
</P>
<P>
In the 15 years since Life published its list of American milestones, 
residential air conditioning has gone from a luxury item to an expected part of 
daily life. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, air conditioning for the home took off with the residential 
building boom of the 1970s. Industry sources estimate that 75% of the homes 
here are equipped with some form of refrigerated cooling device. 
</P>
<P>
And yet for large numbers of homeowners, air conditioning remains something of 
a mystery to be misunderstood and misused -- when it isn't being taken for 
granted, which is most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Air conditioning, whether a central system or self-contained window unit, is 
basically a refrigerator turned extrovert. It uses the same components 
(compressor, condenser, evaporator, fan and working fluid) to cool air, but on 
a much larger scale. 
</P>
<P>
A few basic physical laws are at work. Namely, that as the working fluid 
(usually the chlorofluorocarbon Freon) is compressed, it gets hotter, and with 
the release of pressure, it evaporates into a gas and gets cooler. At the same 
time, hot Freon liquid releases heat to its surroundings; cool Freon gas 
absorbs it. 
</P>
<P>
In an air conditioner, the cool gaseous Freon passes through coils in the 
evaporator inside the house where it absorbs heat from the warm interior air. 
It then passes through transfer lines to the compressor-condenser outside. Here 
the gas is compressed into a hot (200 degrees Fahrenheit) liquid and pumped 
through the condenser coils. The liquid, now being much hotter than the outside 
air, releases heat to its surroundings before passing back to the evaporator. 
As pressure is released, the liquid Freon turns once more into a cool gas, 
ready to begin another cycle of heat absorption and release. Put simply, an air 
conditioner is like a man bailing out a boat -- except in this case the boat is 
your house, the water is heat, and the bucket is the Freon. 
</P>
<P>
Many people believe that an air conditioner somehow "makes" cold air. 
Scientifically, however, there is no such thing as cold, only varying degrees 
of more or less heat. The cool breeze coming from the fan of an air conditioner 
is air that has lost something -- about 20 degrees of heat. 
</P>
<P>
As far as comfort goes, it is as important for an air conditioner to remove 
moisture from the air as it is to cool that air. This moisture removal is 
possible because the colder air becomes, the less water it can hold. As indoor 
air reaches its saturation point during the cooling process, the moisture it 
contains collects on fins inside the air conditioner and drains away. Think of 
how a glass of ice water "sweats" as warm air cools on contact and gives up its 
moisture. An air conditioner works much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
The failure to understand this process of dehumidification can lead a homeowner 
to choose the wrong air conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
Most people think bigger is better, says Mike Karsten, co-owner of Benchmark 
Air Systems Inc. in Anaheim. But an oversize system cools so rapidly that 
airborne moisture has little chance to condense on collection fins. 
</P>
<P>
"People I run across in residential sales think choosing air conditioning is 
like buying a race car. If 200 horsepower is good, then 400 horsepower is 
great. That isn't the case with air conditioning. Too much cooling, too fast, 
and what you get is very cold damp air," Karsten says. 
</P>
<P>
Most new homeowners don't have to worry about picking the right air 
conditioner. Builders do it for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until the mid-1970s, (residential) air conditioning was optional," Karsten 
says. "Builders didn't prepare homes for it the way they do now, and often the 
homeowners had to buy and install their own systems." 
</P>
<P>
During the "optional period" of the last 20 years, air conditioning proved 
popular and tens of thousands of units were installed. These are the systems 
that have distributors, installers and manufacturers anticipating a surge in 
residential sales as tired units are replaced by new, more efficient models. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Luciano, sales representative for Trane, a large manufacturer of air 
conditioners, says units today are nearly twice as efficient as they were in 
the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Energy conservation is very big today," he says. "Fifteen years ago, air 
conditioners probably ran at (an Energy Efficiency Rating of) five or six. 
Today the average is nine, and by 1992 federal law mandates a level of at least 
10." 
</P>
<P>
EER is the acronym of the moment in air-conditioning circles. Basically, it is 
the measure of the amount of heat a unit can remove per watt-hour of 
electricity consumed. Its cousin, SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating, 
is used to estimate the cost of running an air conditioner over an average 
cooling season. Federal law requires that every air-conditioning unit carry 
these ratings, which are expressed in BTUs, or British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
(A BTU is a measure of cooling capacity. For example, 12,000 BTUs equal one ton 
of refrigeration capacity, or the capacity needed to melt 2,000 pounds of ice 
during a 24-hour period. A typical central air-conditioning system for a 
two-bedroom house may equal three to 3 1/2 tons of cooling capacity, or 36,000 
to 42,000 BTUs.) 
</P>
<P>
Central air conditioners with EERs of 16 or more are gaining popularity with 
residential customers who want to get the most cooling bang for their energy 
buck, according to Luciano. 
</P>
<P>
To help spur the move to save electricity, Southern California Edison offers 
rebates on high-efficiency residential air-conditioning equipment. Edison 
spokesman Kevin Kelley says customers also get billing discounts if they enroll 
in a "cycling" program that will automatically shut off selected residential 
air conditioners by radio remote control during peak demand times. 
</P>
<P>
"These shutdowns last from one hour to no more than six hours," Kelley says. 
"They can take place no more than 15 days a year, usually in the afternoons, 
and never on weekends. Most people who join up aren't even home during the 
times the shutdowns might occur." 
</P>
<P>
Customers who join the program are rewarded with automatic credits for six 
months on their electric bills, regardless of whether shutdowns take place. 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of split systems that use more than one air conditioner to 
cool several areas in the same house has also helped cut operating costs for 
homeowners by making it possible to shut down one of the units when its area is 
not in use. In addition, multi-thermostats can control cooling room by room, 
and timers can turn systems on and off according to a predetermined and, it is 
hoped, a more energy efficient schedule. 
</P>
<P>
For those homeowners planning to replace their old central air-conditioning 
units, care must be taken. Chances are, if a unit dates back much before 1980, 
the piping contains asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
"The EPA estimates that there are 300,000 homes here in Orange County with 
asbestos piping," says Tony Grupensperger, Karsten's partner at Benchmark. "As 
long as it isn't smashed or damaged, it's OK. But if a (homeowner) starts 
tearing it apart and handling it improperly, he'll have major problems." 
</P>
<P>
Major as in money . . . or worse. Once piping that contains asbestos is 
damaged, it must be removed and replaced. And only a licensed asbestos remover 
can do the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Most distributors and installers can't touch it," Grupensperger says. "It's 
the law and it's punishable by imprisonment, and that includes the homeowner 
who tries to fool with it." 
</P>
<P>
Indoor air quality is a growing concern to homeowners, especially if a family 
member suffers from serious allergies. Dust, lint, smoke, pollen and bacteria 
circulate through air-conditioning systems, traveling to all parts of a house 
unless intercepted by a filter. 
</P>
<P>
Throwaway fiber filters remove large airborne particles such as dust, but more 
advanced -- and more expensive -- electrostatic and electronic filters are 
needed to trap various microscopic debris that may include animal dander, fungi 
and even dead skin, according to the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The ACRI also points out that a dirty filter isn't much good for anything 
except cutting air flow to your system. It is recommended that filters be 
replaced or cleaned at least once a month during steady use. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping your cool by installing central air in a typical two-bedroom home can 
run $3,000 to $4,000, according to Grupensperger. And for homes without 
existing duct work, sheet metal and labor costs can add another $500 to $1,000 
to the total. 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to beat the heat on a budget, there is the economy-class 
alternative to central cooling, the room air conditioner. Although still noisy 
despite many manufacturers' claims to the contrary, new models can be 
surprisingly effective at cooling smaller areas. 
</P>
<P>
Prices range from about $300 to $500 for machines with load capacities of 5,000 
to 7,000 BTUs that will adequately cool and dehumidify areas the size of a 
medium bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Installation of room units is usually a do-it-yourself job, although you will 
need help during positioning because the units are heavy (from 50 to 90 pounds) 
and awkward. People living on upper floors need to ensure the installation is 
secure. Two years ago, an air conditioner slipped from a seventh-floor window 
in New York City and plunged to the sidewalk, killing a pedestrian. 
</P>
<P>
Of far more global concern than the errant air conditioner dropping from the 
sky is the use of chlorofluorocarbons that can escape and pose a threat to the 
ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have been experimenting with various approaches to air conditioning 
-- both old and new -- that would eliminate the need for CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
One promising device based on old technology cools air by blowing it through a 
water mist while at the same time managing the neat trick of removing humidity. 
It accomplishes this by adding a desiccant, lithium bromide, to the water to 
"dry" the air as it passes through the spray. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are also working to find environmentally safe refrigerates to 
replace CFCs. If effective substitutes can be found, the millions of 
residential and commercial air conditioners now in use could be made 
ozone-friendly with a simple recharge of the new cooling agents.

DON'T OVERWORK YOUR AIR CONDITIONER 
</P>

<P>
To help you get the best and most economical performance from your air 
conditioner (room or central), here are a few simple hints to recall as the dog 
days of summer send the thermometer red-lining skyward. 
</P>
<P>
If your house has an attic, vent it with a fan so that heated air does not seep 
into living areas. 
</P>
<P>
Use shades and Venetian blinds on windows to keep out sunlight; install outside 
awnings. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as possible in the evening, shut off air conditioning and use a window 
fan to pull in cool air. 
</P>
<P>
All duct piping should be well-insulated, especially in high-heat areas such as 
the attic or in ceiling runs. 
</P>
<P>
Set your thermostat at 78 degrees. Southern California Edison Co. says that 
raising indoor temperature from 70 to a still-comfortable 78 can mean a 30% 
savings on your electric bill. 
</P>
<P>
Install tinted windows to help reflect hot sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Close the fresh-air vent when running a room air conditioner. It will cool more 
efficiently. Also, on humid days, set the fan speed on low; you will sacrifice 
some cooling but more moisture should be pulled from the air. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid installing a room air conditioner in direct sunlight. Solar heating of 
metal parts can slow dissipation of room heat. 
</P>
<P>
If your room air conditioner has plenty of cooling capacity, set up a fan or 
fans to help spread cooling to other rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Heat from nearby lamps and televisions may be sensed by thermostats, causing 
air conditioners to run longer than needed. Keep these appliances away from air 
conditioning controls. 
</P>
<P>
Be careful when turning off air conditioning systems if you have small pets in 
the house. According to Cheri McCully, a veterinary technician at Grand Avenue 
Pet Hospital in Santa Ana, 85 degrees is about tops for caged animals such as 
hamsters and birds. Cats and dogs tolerate heat better, but temperatures much 
above 90 degrees are not recommended for long periods of time. Older pets or 
those in poor health will need cooler environments. If you are going to be away 
from home for the day and it is expected to be a scorcher, set the thermostat 
accordingly. McCully also warns not to turn on fans for pet cooling while you 
are gone because of the danger of electrical fires. CLARK SHARON

If you have a question about a plant or need help with treating exposure to 
what you think is a poisonous plant, call the UC Irvine Regional Poison Center 
at (714) 634-5988 or (800) 544-4404. Because it is difficult to furnish names 
of all plants from a telephone conversation, the center recommends making a 
list of all the plants you do not know that are in your yard or home and take 
them to a nursery so they can be identified.

</P>
<P>
PROGRAMMING: ENTERTAINMENT DIVISION'S NO. 2 MAN WANTED TO BE NO. 1, AND GOT THE 
JOB. HE MAKES IT CLEAR THAT HE'LL BE CALLING THE PROGRAMMING SHOTS FOR THE NO.

By RICK DU BROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warren Littlefield went to his boss back in January and told him that he wanted 
to be president of NBC Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
He was prepared to leave NBC if he didn't get the job. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, his boss was the president of NBC Entertainment, Brandon 
Tartikoff. 
</P>
<P>
Littlefield, who had been head of the network's prime-time programming since 
1987, also made his wishes known to NBC President Robert Wright. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Littlefield got the job, just days before the Aug. 1 deadline on his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
And Tartikoff was moved upstairs as chairman of the NBC Entertainment Group, 
remaining his successor's boss. 
</P>
<P>
"I articulated back in January to Brandon and also to Bob that I had goals and 
aspirations for moving into this position at NBC," Littlefield told The Times 
in an interview. "And the sense that I got from both of them was that it could 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"Brandon clearly said to me, 'I'm ready to get into a new transition also. I 
don't think you should leave this company. I think we can work this out.' That 
was all I needed to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Littlefield, who is 38, bearded, genial and looks like perfect casting for 
"thirtysomething," says he "probably would have" quit NBC if he didn't get the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
He had, in fact, paid his dues for a decade at NBC, working closely with his 
friend Tartikoff and helping to take the network from the basement to the 
penthouse in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
In the five years Littlefield headed the comedy department, NBC developed such 
hits as "Cheers," "The Cosby Show," "The Golden Girls" and "Family Ties." 
</P>
<P>
"If you go through every half-hour on our prime-time schedule today," he says, 
"there's nothing on it that hasn't been developed under my aegis. Every time 
period, every program." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff agrees. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, Tartikoff has cast such a giant shadow in TV in his 10 years at 
the top -- and has become such a well-known personality -- that it is easy to 
overlook his lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
Littlefield is only human. "It's painfully clear to me," he acknowledges, that 
some people "don't have a clue" about his major input. "But the production 
community does." 
</P>
<P>
The considerable task of filling his boss's shoes was all too clear when 
Tartikoff passed the baton to Littlefield on Thursday at a news conference for 
the nation's TV columnists during the summer press tour at the Century Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff tried to remove all doubt that Littlefield would be in command, 
saying flatly: "Ultimately, the buck will stop on his desk." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there was something else in the air for many in the packed house -- a 
certain wistfulness, rare in a business gathering, over the outgoing NBC 
Entertainment president who has been so central to TV history. 
</P>
<P>
Littlefield knows he has a tough act to follow. And if he has a secret weapon, 
it is his directness about NBC, including criticism of the network's mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
He admits, for instance, that ABC, with such series as "thirtysomething" and 
"Twin Peaks," has taken away NBC's reputation for unique shows. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," he says. "The fact of the matter is, we did to some degree lose the 
mantle of innovation and the mantle of quality. We want it back." 
</P>
<P>
He does not, however, think that the aging of NBC's three top hits -- "The 
Cosby Show," "Cheers" and "The Golden Girls" -- is a danger to the network's 
dominance. 
</P>
<P>
Sizing up the 6-year-old "Cosby Show" -- which will be challenged head-on by 
Fox's "The Simpsons" in the new season -- he says he doesn't know how much 
longer it will last. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have a better sense -- and this is the way Bill looks at it -- once we 
start the season," says Littlefield. "We're introducing new characters. We've 
got an entirely new writing staff. And we have a very energized Mr. Cosby. To 
be honest, the way we've approached it with Bill is one year at a time. That's 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
Which means, says Littlefield, that there's no guarantee that "Cosby" will 
return after this season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's right. I think Bill wants to feel that there are more stories to tell." 
</P>
<P>
And "Cheers"? 
</P>
<P>
"I think 'Cheers' can go forever. America is delightfully comfortable with the 
concept. 'Cheers' moved into first place in the ratings after 40 weeks of this 
52-week season. It will most likely finish the season as the No. 1 show." 
</P>
<P>
But what if "Cheers" star Ted Danson leaves the series? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'd cross that bridge when I got to it. But if you said, 'Could I 
envision "Cheers" without Ted Danson?' -- yes, I could, though I'd prefer not 
to." 
</P>
<P>
As for "The Golden Girls," Littlefield says simply, "I don't see a weakness 
creatively." 
</P>
<P>
To Littlefield, these three hits "are important tent-poles to our schedule," 
but he thinks NBC will be well served for years to come by such other series as 
"Unsolved Mysteries," "Empty Nest," "Dear John," "Midnight Caller," "In the 
Heat of the Night" and "Carol &amp; Company." 
</P>
<P>
What worries NBC's new top programmer is that the network, in Tartikoff's 
recent years, may not have been receptive enough to Hollywood's creative 
community because of its filled-up, successful schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff admitted this week, "What was getting harder and harder for me was 
saying no to people who helped NBC to get to the position" that the network has 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a little history to that," says Littlefield. "One of the things that 
(former NBC President) Fred Silverman taught us was, 'You create your own 
ideas. You must be the master of your own destiny. You can't wait for someone 
to knock on your door and hand you a hit.' It was a great message. We were all 
thrilled, and no one more than Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened, though, is that as we got successful, I think there's been a 
sense among creators that 'Well, these guys know exactly what they want to do 
and therefore maybe they don't want to hear our ideas.' As I look at how we can 
improve who we are and how we do business, that's an area I think we can 
improve in." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff is famous for supposedly jotting down two words, "MTV cops," and then 
having that concept turned into the series "Miami Vice." And at Thursday's news 
conference, he brought down the house by coolly doing a rap number (in dark 
suit and tie) about NBC with rap music star Will Smith, the star of the 
network's big sitcom hope for fall, "Fresh Prince of Bel Air." 
</P>
<P>
But Littlefield says quietly that he's also plugged in. No, he says, he doesn't 
rap -- "I haven't tried. But I'll tell you one thing: When (producer) Quincy 
Jones pitched 'Fresh Prince,' I had seen Will Smith on MTV. I knew who the guy 
was. And nobody else in the room did." 
</P>
<P>
Not even Tartikoff, who's been touting Smith and his series like crazy? 
</P>
<P>
"No," says Littlefield. 
</P>
<P>
The new NBC Entertainment chief was appointed to his job effective immediately. 
A native of Montclair, N.J., he is married and has two children. Asked what 
he'd like to do that Tartikoff didn't, Littlefield says his boss "did a lot," 
but he adds: 
</P>
<P>
"I think the challenges now are far greater -- and not just things like cable. 
We're competing for America's leisure time, and life has gotten far more 
complex, far more rushed. What we have to do is put on something that's 
important enough, or entertaining enough, for the audience to say, 'I want to 
seek that out.' Somehow, our programming has to make it into that list of 
priorities."

THANKS TO AMERICA, KING IS THE REAL CHAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He remains, nearly 20 years after walking out of an Ohio penitentiary, one of 
the most remarkable figures in American sports. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, on an income-tax evasion charge, the federal government spent 
several million dollars trying to put Don King, the flamboyant boxing promoter, 
in prison. It couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
And last week, in a New York federal courtroom, Buster Douglas and John 
Johnson, seeking to break a promotional contract with King, couldn't bring him 
to gaff, either. In a settlement agreement, King will be paid a reported $4.5 
million not to promote the Douglas-Evander Holyfield fight in Las Vegas this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, the heavyweight champion, stands to earn $24 million from Mirage Hotel 
President Steve Wynn for the bout. 
</P>
<P>
King cackles all the way to his bank, praising the U.S. Constitution, the 
greatness of the American judicial system . . . and shrieking: "Only in America 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
This 58-year-old, 250-pound man with high blood pressure has reason to be a 
patriot. "I never married no boss' daughter -- there was never nobody for me 
but me," he likes to say. 
</P>
<P>
He was raised in grinding poverty on Cleveland's east side in the Depression. 
His father died in a steel mill accident when King was 10. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, the fast-talking King became a highly successful numbers 
runner. A 1966 manslaughter conviction stemmed from a confrontation with a 
rival who died after a street fight. 
</P>
<P>
So, when he was released from prison in 1971 after serving four years, who 
would have given odds that, two decades later, Don King would be one of the 
wealthiest and most successful sports promoters of the 20th Century? 
</P>
<P>
His big break came in 1972, when he talked Muhammad Ali into fighting three 
exhibition bouts one night for a Cleveland charity. Actually, others call it 
his big break. King has always insisted that his big break was being born in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
For two decades, he has infuriated, confounded and been cussed by rival 
promoters, fighters and their managers, television and hotel executives and 
sportswriters, who have been knocking him since the mid-1970s, often with good 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
Among King's most-criticized practices: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tying up the careers of fighters with exclusive, long-term promotional 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Contractually requiring fighters to work out at his Ohio training camp, 
then charging them up to $1,000 a day to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Requiring fighters to hire his stepson, Carl King, as their manager. 
</P>
<P>
When Tim Witherspoon and Bonecrusher Smith fought in 1986 in New York, Carl 
King was manager or co-manager of both fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Outrageous? Of course. That's Don King. Only in America, and only in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
King takes advantage of the fact that his sport is hopelessly fractured by five 
governing bodies, whose officials are primarily focused on fat sanctioning fees 
and their frequent-flier accounts. 
</P>
<P>
When Mike Tyson took on Douglas, a 42-1 shot, last February in Tokyo, King 
couldn't lose, as Donald Trump pointed out during testimony last week. 
</P>
<P>
Contractually, King was the promoter of both boxers. To secure a title bout, 
Douglas was required to sign a contract that made him a King fighter through 
1992, heavyweight champion or not. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, after Douglas knocked out Tyson, two rounds after Tyson had Douglas 
down for what King claimed to be a long count, King blew his cool. 
</P>
<P>
He raved, ranted and fumed afterward, protesting the eighth-round "long count." 
Douglas and his manager, Johnson, fumed, too. They thought that King not only 
yanked the spotlight off a guy who'd just pulled off one of the century's great 
sports upsets, but breached his contract by failing to attend to Douglas' "best 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
In court, however, it was apparent from day one they couldn't prove that King 
sought to manipulate the result. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the fight, in a Tokyo hotel room, Douglas lay quietly on his 
bed, smiling at the scene swirling around him. Men who were getting very drunk 
hugged each other, cried and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
All but Douglas and Johnson. It seemed sad that at such a moment they were 
angry. The manager told reporters: "Don King may never promote another Buster 
Douglas fight again." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, in yet another courtroom, Johnson and Douglas were only the 
latest to learn that boxing's heavyweight champion is not a fighter, but a 
big-bellied, frizzy-haired promoter. 
</P>
<P>
Only in America. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Holmes visited Ontario the other day and announced he will fight in an 
exhibition match for a promoter named Bob Rey at the Ontario Red Lion Inn on 
Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of problems. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, 40, will need a California boxer's license to appear, even in an 
exhibition match; and because he's over 36, he will be required to appear at a 
California Athletic Commission meeting for special consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Rey doesn't have a California promoter's license. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Ruelas, half of Ten Goose Boxing's Ruelas act, will fight Alejandro 
Armenta on July 31 at The Country Club in Reseda, then will take on Jobe 
Walters of Long Beach, N.Y., on Aug. 17 at Bally's in Las Vegas. Older brother 
Gabriel Ruelas, who suffered a broken elbow against Jeff Franklin in his last 
bout, has been cleared for gym work beginning in three weeks and could fight as 
soon as September. . . . Gerry Coetzee, one-time World Boxing Assn. heavyweight 
champion from South Africa, is vacationing in Orange County with his family. 
Coetzee, 34, has told friends he's pondering a comeback. But his trainer, 
Jackie McCoy, says the fighter hasn't mentioned it to him. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Edson, event coordinator for Bob Arum's boxing shows, tells this story 
about Aaron Pryor, before the 1983 Pryor-Alexis Arguello fight in Miami: "I 
checked Aaron into his hotel suite two weeks before the fight and watched the 
bellman haul up 72 -- and I counted 'em -- pieces of luggage. Aaron tipped him 
three dollars. I said: 'Aaron!' And he said: 'Hey, nobody ever helped me on the 
way up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that of the two major Nevada boxing shows held on the 
same July 8 afternoon, the Las Vegas Hilton's Jorge Paez-Troy Dorsey draw 
easily outgrossed the Mark Breland-Aaron Davis bout -- won by Davis -- at 
Harrah's Reno. Paez-Dorsey did $152,240, Breland-Davis $21,204. In addition,

COURT WAS BRENNAN'S LIFE AND HE GAVE IT HIS LAST ENERGY

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The resignation of Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. caught most of 
Washington by surprise Friday night, but it was not totally unexpected among 
those who had sufficient personal contact with him to see the increasingly 
visible signs of his deteriorating health. Among those observers was Times 
staff writer Jim Mann, who covered the Supreme Court from 1976 through 1984 and 
who returned three months ago to interview the 84-year-old jurist. 
</P>
<P>
When I walked into Justice William J. Brennan Jr.'s chambers last April, I 
hadn't talked to him for more than six years, not since I had left the Supreme 
Court beat back in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
What I saw, and what he said, took me by surprise. At the age of nearly 84, 
Justice Brennan, the court's senior member, was quite evidently failing -- and 
he came very close to admitting it. 
</P>
<P>
"Recently, my doctor told me I'd better not make any speeches or other outside 
activities," Brennan told me in one of his last interviews as a member of the 
court. "I'd better just stick to my work here . . . . I apparently have some of 
the ills that afflict 84-year-olds, and therefore I'd better pace myself better 
than I've been pacing myself." 
</P>
<P>
His once-booming, gravelly voice was low and weak. His body was thinner. His 
mind and mood were good, but he seemed preoccupied with his health -- so much 
so, in fact, that he dwelt on it in the sort of detail Supreme Court justices 
usually avoid. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back from Israel a couple of years ago with a terrible case of 
shingles, really a miserable case of shingles," Brennan said. "Then I had a 
serious reaction only last fall to antibiotics that I was taking for influenza 
. . . at about that time. And I'm not out of that yet . . . . It was the 
reaction to those things that prompted my doctor to say that you just better 
slow down." 
</P>
<P>
Confronted by such problems and doctor's orders, Brennan decided to conserve 
all his remaining energy for the Supreme Court. He clung to the court as 
tenaciously as men cling to life itself. For Brennan, that was natural: for 34 
years, the Supreme Court was his life. 
</P>
<P>
He canceled 12 scheduled speeches and other public appearances. "Right now, my 
wife and I are busily trying to figure out what in hell we're going to do this 
summer," he said, the frustration evident in his tired voice. 
</P>
<P>
Others in similar situations have elected to step aside and to spend their 
precious time with their families, away from the tensions and demanding 
schedule of a full-time job. On the court over the last decade, Justices Potter 
Stewart and Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Chief Justice Warren E. Burger all chose to 
step aside before their health began to fail. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a crucial difference between Brennan and the other three 
justices. Stewart, Powell and Burger were all moderate-to-conservative justices 
who knew their replacements would be selected by President Ronald Reagan and 
his conservative Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan, by contrast, was the acknowledged leader of the liberal wing of the 
court. His successor was not likely to be as avowedly committed to the causes 
of individual justice and freedom as was Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Brennan insisted that he never thought of such political 
considerations. "It's never for a minute dawned on me that it was important to 
my decision whether or not to retire who sat in the White House," he told me. 
"Never gave it that much thought." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Brennan knew full well he was by far the most effective remaining advocate 
of the traditions of former Chief Justice Earl Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Even in his last months on the court, more than two decades after Warren had 
retired, Brennan was eager as ever to proclaim the values he felt the Warren 
Court had embodied. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of the Warren Court was, he said, "an application of the 
Constitution to enhance and further human dignity and individual rights. Rather 
than, as was the case for a long while, to have the court put its clout on the 
protection of interests other than the interests of the individual." 
</P>
<P>
On the bench, Brennan pressed forward in the Warren Court tradition until the 
very end. But he also became philosophical about the seemingly inevitable 
swings in public opinion and changes in the direction of the Supreme Court 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps that's the very nature of our democracy, that, as a democracy, we 
don't stand still," he said. "We're always pushing ahead, to goals that we've 
had from our beginning. And again, in individual rights and individual 
liberties, we'll get back to them in time." 
</P>
<P>
He said "we," but he was referring to mankind, not himself. Brennan knew that 
his own time on the court was running out.

PRETTY FACE, UGLY CRIMES: KILLER BACK UP FOR PAROLE

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He could have stepped out of a pulp novel: young, rich, dark, exceedingly 
handsome and very spoiled. First he charmed women. Then he terrified them. 
Finally, he involved two of them in murder. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Mark J. Baker, now 33 and serving life in prison for bludgeoning a 
friend to death on a Dana Point beach, will have his fifth shot at parole. 
</P>
<P>
His latest ex-wife, whom he wooed and wed while she was working in the prison, 
says Baker deserves another chance. Not so Baker's prosecutors, who say he is 
still manipulative and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that he's a sociopath," said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Jay Moseley. "How many guys do you know who've been prosecuted for murder on 
both coasts by the age of 20?" 
</P>
<P>
The scion of a wealthy Indiana family, Baker's past spans military academy, 
jewelry theft, a cocaine habit that depleted his trust fund, a girlfriend whom 
he shot in the head, a fiancee who stood beside him while he testified against 
the girlfriend, two wives and two murder trials. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was reared in Tipton, Ind., the pampered son of a prosperous interior 
designer and furniture store owner. According to his second wife, Janet Pekrul, 
Baker enjoyed the family's lakeside home, Chicago penthouse, Fort Lauderdale 
condominium and the Firebird his parents gave him as a high school graduation 
present. 
</P>
<P>
"He got everything he wanted, and he just thought he could get away with 
anything. . . ," Pekrul said. "He got too much, too fast, too young, and he 
just lost control." 
</P>
<P>
At 19, Baker, who was already on parole for theft, was charged with the murder 
of a Ft. Lauderdale doctor's wife. According to prosecutors and trial 
testimony, Baker and his girlfriend, Karen Lynn Jensen, went to the home of 
Marion Pitone, 56, whom Jensen knew, with the intention of robbing Pitone of 
her jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen later testified that she talked her way into the home with Baker, and 
then went to the bathroom. Inside, she heard two shots, and when she emerged, 
she testified, she saw Baker fire two more shots into Pitone. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker testified that it was he who went into the bathroom and heard the 
shots. He told the jury that he emerged to find Jensen standing over Pitone and 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
The Broward County prosecution contended that Baker had wiped prints from the 
murder scene, dumped the gun in a canal and had his bags packed when police 
arrived to arrest him -- a pattern that he was to repeat in Orange County, 
Moseley said. 
</P>
<P>
But as the prosecution's star witness, Jensen was deeply flawed. She had been 
picked up by police for another burglary, and granted immunity from prosecution 
in return for testifying against Baker. She also admitted that she had falsely 
accused another man in the past -- because, she said, Baker had told her to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen also testified that Baker had beaten her regularly, giving her two black 
eyes and several broken bones, and had once shot her in the head. She showed 
the jury the scar on her head where the bullet grazed her. A police report 
taken at the time records the shooting as accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen testified that she was afraid of Baker, but that she loved him. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury believed Baker, and acquitted him of first-degree murder on April 
15, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
According to Broward County prosecutors, on the second day of his trial, Baker 
had offered to plead guilty if the state would reduce the charges against him 
from first- to second-degree murder. The prosecutor refused the plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"He killed her and he fooled the jury," the victim's husband, Dr. A. Joseph 
Pitone, said in a telephone interview Friday. Pitone said he believes Baker had 
carefully planned the murder, checking with his office to see when he would be 
away and killing Marion Pitone so she would not be able to identify Jensen. "I 
hope he stays (in prison) for the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
"He was a nice-looking defendant, and that carries a lot of impact," Moseley 
said. "People think, 'What does a murderer look like?' They may not expect 
horns and fangs, but they do expect somebody who looks the part. . . . The more 
horrible the crime, the less likely people are to attribute that to a 
clean-cut, nice-looking person." 
</P>
<P>
Baker himself was stunned by his acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel beautiful," Baker told reporters at the time. "I didn't expect it. I 
have no idea what happened, but by the grace of God, it came through. And now, 
I'm going home." 
</P>
<P>
Five months later, Baker eloped to Las Vegas with a Newport Beach heiress, 
Suzanne Volkman. 
</P>
<P>
On a police form, Suzanne was later to list her occupation as "lives off trust 
fund." But the trust fund did not go far enough. Baker told police and family 
that his new wife had credit card debts, and that he had spent an inheritance 
"doing a lot of cocaine." Baker later confessed he stole a $10,000 diamond 
necklace from his mother-in-law and pawned it to pay his wife's debts. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 11, 1978, Mark and Suzanne Baker and a friend, Karl Marcus Chancellor, 
19, who also lived in Newport Beach, drove to what is now Salt Creek Beach 
Park. While Suzanne waited in the car, Baker bludgeoned Chancellor to death 
with the butt of a shotgun, and stole money and a vial of LSD from Chancellor's 
body, which was found by surfers the next morning, according to police and 
prosecutors. Then Baker went home, washed the murder weapon and dumped it in a 
swamp in Garden Grove, where it was later recovered. 
</P>
<P>
According to the victim's father, Lee Chancellor, Baker threatened to kill 
Suzanne if she testified against him. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when Suzanne learned Baker had pawned the necklace, she told her 
mother about what had happened on the beach. Her mother took her to the police, 
according to Moseley and Pekrul. 
</P>
<P>
Baker pleaded guilty to first-degree murder as his trial was getting under way, 
telling the judge, "I don't want to die in the gas chamber." He was 21. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, and has 
been serving his sentence at the California Medical Facility at Vacaville. His 
marriage to Suzanne was annulled about six months later. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1984, he met Janet Pekrul, then 20 and a clerk in the prison 
file room, where Baker worked. He had started lifting weights. They had long 
conversations through the window that separated their work areas. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very attractive," said Pekrul, who has since divorced Baker and 
remarried. "He's got very nice blue eyes and straight white teeth. He doesn't 
have tattoos." 
</P>
<P>
Pekrul quit her job and began visiting Baker. They were married in the prison 
chapel on Jan. 19, 1985. Contributing to their decision to marry, Pekrul said, 
was the policy of conjugal visits every other month for married couples. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1988, Moseley said, information damaging to Baker's chances of 
parole twice disappeared from his files. Among the missing items: the autopsy 
pictures of Chancellor, showing a face battered almost beyond recognition; a 
letter in which Baker confessed to his mother-in-law that he had taken $5,000 
from the body, but had told the court he stole only $1,000; and a sheaf of news 
clippings about Baker's first murder trial in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Pekrul insists that she did not tamper with the file. She said she could not 
have done so since she had left her job long before, and had been ostracized by 
her former co-workers for marrying an inmate. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'Ooooo, she was taken in and manipulated by an inmate,' " Pekrul 
said. "It's like, either you're a cop or a convict. You're disowned, you're a 
scarlet woman, like put a big 'C' on my shirt. . . . But I loved him. I really 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Pekrul said Baker was widely liked by the prison staff and has never had 
disciplinary violations. "There's a lot of gross people in prison, and when you 
see him, it's like, 'What's this man doing here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Moseley, however, charges that "some very curious things have occurred with 
relationship to him in this facility." Among other things, Moseley said, "I've 
heard them gush about how good-looking the guy is." While being admitted to the 
prison for Baker's 1988 parole hearing, the prosecutor added, he overheard a 
female prison guard telling Baker's defense attorney: "He's my baby. You better 
get him out." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's parole is opposed by the Orange County sheriff and two other dedicated 
foes. The first is Moseley, whose job it is to keep career criminals from 
slipping though the cracks and out the cell door. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only guy between him and the end zone," Moseley said. "If he gets past 
me, he's out." 
</P>
<P>
The second foe is Lee Chancellor, who became a crusader for victims' rights 
after his son's murder. Chancellor is a member of the group Citizens for Law 
and Order, has spent thousands of dollars tracking Baker's case, and plans to 
attend Baker's parole hearing Monday accompanied by the mother of murdered 
actress Sharon Tate. 
</P>
<P>
"I hesitate to discuss this for fear that this psychopath will somehow get good 
press," Chancellor said. "They still refer to this murderer as 'Mr. Baker.' I 
don't want him referred to as anything but 'murderer Baker.' " 
</P>
<P>
After 13 years, Chancellor acknowledges he is still enraged -- at Baker, at 
Baker's parents, who have supported their son, and at what he sees as a 
bankrupt system of justice. Among other things, Chancellor objects to his son's 
confessed killer being permitted conjugal visits and being granted his first 
parole hearing four years after his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, through a prison spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed. His ex-wife, 
however, said it is the Chancellors who have kept Baker behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done nothing wrong since he's been there. . . ," Pekrul said. "People 
have done such worse things and gotten out. I can't see why the district 
attorney has it in for him so bad, except that the victim's family has been so 
involved in it. They're keeping this alive . . . as if he's a dangerous person, 
which he's not." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from Indiana, Baker's father said he believes his son 
has changed. James Baker said his son has a job waiting if he is released. 
</P>
<P>
"He would be welcomed by his family, friends and peers. They all ask about him 
to this day. They think it was a tragic situation, but he has their support," 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Pekrul said Baker has changed profoundly in the last 13 years, in large part 
due to "the realization that his father could not get him out of this jam." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would have been better had he gotten a second-degree (conviction in 
Florida) and done some time, 'cause then he would have learned," Pekrul said. " 
. . . He got in over his head. His father couldn't help him, the best lawyers 
couldn't help him and he is paying for it. And he's going to keep paying for it 
because that family is not going to forget." 
</P>
<P>
Pekrul said she divorced Baker not because she did not love him but because she 
wanted "a normal life." Despite her support for her ex-husband's release, she 
says she now has more sympathy for the Chancellors. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a baby now. And if anyone ever hurt my baby, I would see them burn in 
hell," she said. "They lost their son. It was their baby. So I can understand 
what they're doing. I would do the same thing."
