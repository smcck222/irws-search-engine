BENJAMIN TAMMUZ; ISRAELI AUTHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Benjamin Tammuz, 70, a prominent Russian-born Israeli author, sculptor and 
proponent of Jewish-Arab coexistence. Tammuz was known as one of Israel's 
foremost modern writers whose books contained humorous and introspective 
portrayals of that nation's pioneer generation. He published dozens of books, 
short stories and satirical columns in the prestigious Haaretz daily. Among the 
most popular is a humorous sketch of pioneer days called "The Life of Elyakum." 
He was also among the leaders of the defunct Canaanite Movement, which 
left-wing poets and artists began before Israel's founding in 1948. The 
movement sought a way of forging Jewish-Arab cooperation. In his last televised 
interview about a week ago, Tammuz suggested that the 19-month Palestinian 
uprising in the occupied territories had reinvigorated his Canaanite beliefs. 
Tammuz studied history at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1950-51 and later edited Art 
in Israel, a survey of Israeli art trends in the 1960s. He was a sculptor who 
designed a monument to fallen Israeli pilots that is now at Tel Aviv's 
Independence Park. In Jerusalem on Wednesday of cancer.

NIGEL DENNIS; SATIRIST, PLAYWRIGHT AND NOVELIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nigel Dennis, the dramatically satiric playwright and novelist whose book 
"Cards of Identity" with its fantasy and black humor won cult status among 
disenchanted young Britons in the 1950s, has died at the age of 77. 
</P>
<P>
The award-winning novelist, playwright and reviewer, who specialized in 
dehumanized comedy, died Wednesday after what his family described only as a 
long illness. 
</P>
<P>
During the early 1930s, Dennis sold clothes door to door and contributed 
articles to weekly periodicals. In 1934, he left Britain for the United States, 
where he remained until 1949. While in America he worked as secretary to the 
National Board of Review of Motion Pictures in New York City and as assistant 
editor and book review editor of the New Republic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Novel a Satire 
</P>
<P>
His first novel, the comic satire "Boys and Girls Come Out to Play," appeared 
in 1949. It was praised by reviewers but had little commercial success. 
</P>
<P>
He was drama critic for the British magazine Encounter from 1960 to 1963, was 
joint editor of Encounter from 1967 to 1970 and meanwhile was chief book 
reviewer for the Sunday Telegraph of London from 1961 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
He established a reputation as one of Britain's most incisive and amusing 
reviewers, once describing D.H. Lawrence's "Lady Chatterley's Lover" as "that 
mournful, squawking, tedious little book." He also was noted for his criticisms 
of "two-volume biographies of one-volume persons." 
</P>
<P>
"Cards of Identity" appeared in 1955. Satirizing high-minded pretensions and 
people's craving for security, it describes a conference of the Identity Club 
whose aim is to rule the world by manipulating people's personalities. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis turned "Cards of Identity" into a play the following year and it was 
staged at London's Royal Court Theater. His play "The Making of Moo" was staged 
at the Royal Court in 1957. The satire on religion drew some protests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Play Commissioned 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, the organizers of the Edinburgh Festival, the prestigious arts 
festival held annually in the Scottish capital, commissioned a play from him, 
"August for the People," in which Rex Harrison starred. It was staged the same 
year at the Royal Court Theater and shown on television. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis' biography of the 18th-Century Irish satirist Jonathan Swift appeared in 
1964 and won a Royal Society of Literature award. 
</P>
<P>
His last novel, "A House in Order," set during a third world war, appeared in 
1966 when he won the Heinemann Award for Fiction.

AL MARTINEZ: A QUIET PLACE ON THE TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture this: I am strolling up a quiet trail in the Santa Monica Mountains, 
whistling a charming ethnic tune my mother taught me and listening to the 
twitter of rufous-sided towhees. 
</P>
<P>
From far off I hear a faint whirring sound and cup one hand to my ear, like a 
maiden in a fairy tale harking to the buzz of an insect in the chaparral; 
perhaps a cricket rubbing its thighs together to summon a love of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Then I hear the shout, "Go, dude, man rip 'er out," and I realize this is no 
love-smitten cricket. I leap to the side of the trail, barely escaping three 
teen-agers from hell coming at 40 m.p.h. on fat-wheeled bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
It's happened. 
</P>
<P>
The birds and I have had to scatter for our lives to escape the dimwits howling 
down on us like banshees, leaving shattered serenity and an enraged, otherwise 
peaceful stroller in their wake. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, one of many, occurred on a fire trail in Topanga State Park, 
where I often spend my leisure. As a result of these encounters, my attitude 
toward mountain bikes is not what you would call forbearing, unless you 
perceive forbearance in the attitude of the Israelis toward the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
I therefore view with alarm the possibility that these kamikaze cyclists will 
soon be allowed not only on fire trails but on hiking trails as well. Heaven 
help the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
Even as I write, a policy regarding bikes in the Santa Monica Mountains is 
under review by the California Department of Parks and Recreation. Should they 
or should they not be allowed on hiking trails whereupon stroll decent, 
God-fearing, flag-loving people like you and me? 
</P>
<P>
The Park Department's Dan Preece, who oversees the Santa Monica Mountains 
District, has made his recommendations to Sacramento but won't tell me what 
they are. I'm hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say I believe everyone on a mountain bike is thoughtless and 
demented. Many of them no doubt read and write, have learned to tie their own 
shoelaces and are kind to puppies. 
</P>
<P>
But the others have little regard for bones or speed limits, and set out each 
weekend to break them with impunity on the fire trails of the mountain parks. 
To allow them on hiking trails would be to put rattlesnakes in a baby's crib. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club feels the way I do, only more so. It would allow only coyotes 
and barefoot children in the park and views with horror the possibility of 
wheeled vehicles on the trails, including bicycles. The jury is still out on 
baby carriages and wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
One big problem, says Sierra Clubber Dave Brown, is that you can't hear the 
bicycles coming, except for the insect-like whirring sound. Brown is chairman 
of the club's Santa Monica Mountains Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
"The silence, speed and growing numbers of them make them incompatible with the 
natural outdoor experience," he said. "They will take over easy hiking trails 
used by senior citizens and bird watchers. Old ladies will be in danger of 
being clobbered." 
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens and bird watchers cartwheeling down a mountainside, while 
amusing, would certainly not add to anyone's enjoyment of the parks. 
</P>
<P>
I put all this to Peter Heumann, who is on the steering committee of the 
Concerned Off Road Bicycle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Peter is one of the good guys. He is not, as he puts it, a 15-year-old trying 
to take your elbow off on a downhill run. 
</P>
<P>
If Peter on his bicycle and me on my feet happened to meet unexpectedly on a 
precipitous trail, I know Peter would ride off into space rather than 
jeopardize my safety. 
</P>
<P>
Peter, in short, is a saint. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure there are irresponsible cyclists," St. Peter said, "just as there are 
irresponsible hikers and irresponsible equestrians, but the Sierra Club doesn't 
own the mountains. We pay taxes and have a right to enjoy them too." 
</P>
<P>
If bicyclists don't belong on the trails, he adds, then equestrians don't 
belong on the trails either. 
</P>
<P>
"Your right to peace," St. Peter declared, "should also include not stepping in 
horse manure." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with talking to reasonable people on both sides is that you end up 
like a feather in the breeze, floating somewhere between them. 
</P>
<P>
But I still don't think even St. Peter is going to be able to control kamikaze 
bicyclists on mountain trails, and they don't belong there until someone can. 
</P>
<P>
I want to go back to listening to the Rufous-sided Towhees and the love call of 
crickets without fear of being skewered on somebody's handlebars.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOSPITAL ANNOUNCES COST-CUTTING MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its latest effort to close a $9-million revenue gap, San Pedro Peninsula 
Hospital said this week it has consolidated several departments and 
reclassified a number of management positions and will eliminate the equivalent 
of 100 full-time jobs -- some through layoffs -- by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital President John Wilson said job reductions will involve attrition, 
reduction in hours and reclassification. He said there will be some layoffs 
beginning next week, but he does not know how many. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the reorganization plan is the final segment of a program under way 
since January by the national accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney to stem 
the flow of red ink. The plan was unanimously approved by the hospital board, 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Previous Ernst &amp; Whinney recommendations put into effect have included 109 
layoffs, reduction in work hours of 26 other employees and elimination of the 
family practice residency program and in-patient psychiatric services. The 
hospital also sold its outpatient dialysis unit to Innovative Dialysis Systems, 
which is continuing to operate it.

MAN'S ANGER OVER BRUTAL SEXUAL ATTACK IN INGLEWOOD TURNS INTO HELP FOR 
SURVIVORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marvin Feldman says that when he heard the radio news report, he felt "like 
someone had hit me in the stomach." 
</P>
<P>
A man had broken into a home near Hollywood Park race track in Inglewood, raped 
two women and a girl, then shot each several times as they lay bound on the 
floor. A 19-year-old victim died, but her 32-year-old house mate and the older 
woman's daughter, 14, survived. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, a Van Nuys public relations consultant, did not know any of the 
victims, but he had a chance meeting with a friend of the murdered woman a few 
days after the June 3 attack and decided: "Let's do something." 
</P>
<P>
The result was formation of a group called Help Each Life Please, which so far 
has collected $4,500 in donations for the mother and daughter and for the dead 
woman's two orphaned children. 
</P>
<P>
HELP has also recruited a doctor, Santa Monica ophthalmologist Marshall J. 
Keyes, who will donate his services to help the teen-ager, who lost an eye in 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
A suspect, J. C. Metoyer, 19, was arrested in the Crenshaw District a week 
after the attack. The reputed gang member is scheduled to face a preliminary 
hearing next Friday in Los Angeles Municipal Court on 11 felony charges, 
including murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Every now and then I just sit and think, 'Why?' " the surviving mother said in 
a telephone interview. "I think, "Why me and why my daughter?' " She is living 
with her four children at a friend's house in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo Bank at 400 S. Market St. in Inglewood is collecting the donations.

SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS: SHOULD CONFEDERATE FLAG BE BANNED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raskin failed to recall that the name of the country the Confederate flag flew 
over was the Confederate States of America. If he would ban its use, would he 
also ban the flags of all other republics that were in this country that are in 
use today, including the state flags of California and Texas? Also the flag he 
refers to was never the national flag of the Confederacy but only a banner 
flown on the field of battle. 
</P>
<P>
As to the reference of it representing a burning American flag, that is absurd; 
it is a St. Andrew's cross with 13 stars representing the states of its nation. 
</P>
<P>
Raskin's statement about armed rebellion and treason is incorrect; the states 
simply seceded, as was their right at the time, and were forced to defend that 
right and defend their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Raskin's attempt to perpetuate the myth that the Confederate states fought for 
slavery is an injustice coming from a man with his knowledge of the law. The 
Confederacy fought for the right of the states to govern themselves, as the 
Supreme Court has ruled in many cases. 
</P>
<P>
Raskin also forgets that many of the leaders of that short-lived nation went on 
to serve the reunited country as senators, congressmen and even on the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
It is because of rash statements such as Raskin's that this flag is misused by 
bigots and misguided radicals, and wrongly thought to represent slavery by 
many, when in fact it represents freedom, pride, and our right to defend that 
freedom.

HIGH COST OF THE B-2 STEALTH BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, the B-2 stealth bomber is, in the words of Air Force Secretary Donald B. 
Rice, "the most efficient option available" to threaten well-defended Soviet 
targets. ("Capitol Hill Has 'Sticker Shock' Over B-2," Part I, July 13). 
</P>
<P>
Which war are we fighting here? This is all old talk. No nation today can 
afford major war, let alone the nuclear winter a nuclear war would bring. This 
is just pork-barrel politics the way Americans have always liked it. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Western world is in debt up to its eyeballs. If America wants to 
make a contribution to the security of the West, if nothing else, it can put 
its financial house in order. Then, short of nuclear exchanges with the 
Soviets, we at least won't die at the barricades over food riots in a few 
years.

HIGH COST OF THE B-2 STEALTH BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a professional estimator I deal with what can be bought for a given sum of 
money. Here are two lists showing what can be had for roughly $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
The first list: building of a new VA hospital, two small medical research 
centers, 20 ten-unit apartment buildings, and 10 drug rehabilitation centers. 
Also included are purchases of two F-16 fighter planes, 1,000 pickup trucks, 
1,000 personal computers, five police helicopters, and funds to repair some 
5,000 miles of highways. 
</P>
<P>
The second list shows only a purchase of one B-2 stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps President Bush and Congress should study these lists. Maybe they might 
come up with other lists of items financed by our tax dollars.

HIGH COST OF THE B-2 STEALTH BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"One small step for defense, one giant leap for deficits." As usual Conrad hits 
the nail right on the head regarding the B-2 bomber (July 18). 
</P>
<P>
In an ad commemorating the U.S. landing on the moon, Rockwell International 
claims: "20 years later America's imprint on history is deeper than ever." 
That's right, never before has the U.S. had a deficit as high as we have now. 
So, the Air Force is imposing "strict military secrecy" on the "significant 
growth of the B-2 cost." Are we already living under a military dictatorship? 
</P>
<P>
The B-2 bomber does not bring us one iota closer to space exploration. It does, 
however, bring us closer to financial disaster.

SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS: SHOULD CONFEDERATE FLAG BE BANNED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raskin's column delivers an extremely simplified version of the Civil War, not 
unlike a Classic Comic version of "Hamlet." He has boiled the Civil War down 
solely to the issue of slavery vs. emancipation. This is a view too often held 
these days by many who are lacking education in Southern history. He failed to 
recognize that the seeds of the Civil War were planted during the nullification 
crisis of 1832, when North Carolina refused to comply with taxation that 
unfairly burdened Southerners and provided newly constructed roads for 
Northerners. 
</P>
<P>
Raskin wrote, "It (the Confederate flag) was flown by those states that 
conspired to bring down the U.S. government through an act of war." The 
Confederate States of America did not wish to "bring down" the U.S. government, 
but wished to peacefully coexist. He failed to mention that President Lincoln 
refused to open negotiations with the Confederate government regarding Fort 
Sumter. He failed to mention that the Confederate government offered to let 
merchant ships into the harbor to sell goods but were refused. 
</P>
<P>
Why was it that in a nation born of rebellion to its British rulers, less than 
100 later people who sought a peaceful escape from the constant maligning of 
their constitutional rights were destroyed? 
</P>
<P>
The Confederate flag is not a symbol of slavery to all, and for those to whom 
it is, I pity. I hope that Raskin realizes someday that flying the flag of the 
Confederacy can be a memorial to those who sought to protect their rights under 
a Constitution that they thought would protect them but failed. It is a part of 
this nation's history which we cannot ignore, but should be remembered in hopes 
that we can learn from it.

HIGH COST OF THE B-2 STEALTH BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On July 18, the lead story in The Times hailed the first flight of the B-2 
stealth bomber. Of course, also referenced was the price of $530 million per 
plane, and a total of over $70 billion to fund the total quantity requested by 
the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the front page that day was a story relating how 39 million 
impoverished Americans (that's 17% of the total population) lacked access to 
health care and would die needlessly from cancer. That estimated 39 million 
living below the poverty level would have a survival rate up to 15% below that 
of other Americans for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
On Page 6 of that same issue, a story related how the U.S. was prepared to pay 
$30 million to survivors of passengers who perished on the ill-fated Iran Air 
Flight 655 accidentally shot down by the U.S. cruiser Vincennes. 
</P>
<P>
During his 10-day swing through Europe, President Bush offered to provide 
Poland with $100 million as a gesture of good will. During that same 10-day 
period, the news media carried a story that the U.S. is participating in a 
multibillion debt reduction plan for Mexico. This in spite of the fact that we 
are the world's greatest debtor nation (in excess of $547 billion). 
</P>
<P>
Have we got our priorities mixed up? Where, may I ask, is Bush's "kinder, 
gentler America" that he promised during his campaign? In what direction are 
his "thousand points of light" pointing? 
</P>
<P>
When will our political leaders open their eyes to the multitude of problems in 
our country and stop giving away the store? Even worse, when will the American 
voters stop believing in the fairy tales related by a "charismatic 
ex-President," his successor, and the "snake oil sales" of politicians? Isn't 
it time to clean house or must we wait for the house to completely collapse?

SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS: SHOULD CONFEDERATE FLAG BE BANNED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If a man had burned an American flag to protest higher taxes, or a big fat pay 
raise for Congress, or a ban on all firearms, I wonder if there would be this 
popular outcry for a constitutional amendment to prohibit the desecration of 
the flag?

HIGH COST OF THE B-2 STEALTH BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I watched the TV news footage of the B-2 bomber fly into reality I was 
filled with sadness. 
</P>
<P>
$500,000,000 a copy (count the zeros!) to construct a machine to threaten and 
to oppress. Is this how we solve our fears? 
</P>
<P>
It amazes me how we justify our priorities. We are told constructing these 
bombers employs thousands of people so they can finance their lives and rear 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
We are taking blood money for making machines whose sole purpose is the death 
and destruction of our fellow citizens on this earth. Then we go home and teach 
our children to be loving and caring people?

CARWASH SUPPORTERS TO 'FAX WACHS'; 
</P>
<P>
MONUMENT ADVOCATES DIAL LAST-DITCH APPEAL TO COUNCILMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Studio City leaders hope electronics can keep their save-the-carwash campaign 
from bursting like an overblown soap bubble. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they will set up a facsimile machine at the carwash counter on 
Monday so carwash supporters can ask Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs to 
use his influence to get the structure designated a city cultural monument. 
</P>
<P>
Studio City residents have pressed for the monument designation as a way of 
delaying demolition of the carwash and a Unocal gas station and Tiny Naylor's 
coffee shop by a developer who wants to build a $15-million mini-mall at the 
corner of Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs, whose council district includes the corner, is chairman of the council's 
Recreation, Library and Cultural Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
That committee oversees the city's Cultural Affairs Department, whose Cultural 
Heritage Commission on Wednesday rejected a bid to designate the carwash as a 
cultural landmark. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting the 'Fax Wachs' program," Jack McGrath, the carwash campaign's 
organizer, said Friday. "It will be instantaneous democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the commission's 4-0 vote, McGrath urged Wachs to ignore the 
commission action and ask council colleagues to approve the cultural 
designation anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said late Friday he did not know what he will do. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't really decided," he said. "I'll talk to a few people next week and 
review the commission testimony. I'll talk to both sides before coming to a 
conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Nelson, one of Wachs' chief deputies, said his staff was researching a 
series of questions about the carwash that the councilman raised Friday. The 
primary one is whether Wachs can legally take up the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Carwash supporter Walter McIntyre said he tested the "Wachs Fax" on Friday by 
sending a letter to the councilman that characterized the carwash's 
55-foot-tall boomerang-shaped tower as "an above-ground time capsule" that 
could be used to illustrate the 1950s to Studio City residents in the 2050s. 
</P>
<P>
A landmark designation would delay demolition of the carwash for up to one 
year. McIntyre said that would give the community time to come up with a way of 
incorporating the carwash, gas station and coffee shop into developer Ira 
Smedra's proposed two-story Laurel Promenade project. 
</P>
<P>
"Council members pay attention to what's going on in their districts. I'm 
optimistic," McGrath said.

3 WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AFTER SOCCER GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three men who had just finished playing soccer at a Pacoima schoolyard were 
apparently mistaken for gang members and wounded in a drive-by shooting, Los 
Angeles police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings occurred at 9 p.m. Thursday at the corner of Pierce Street and 
Glenoaks Boulevard, police said. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were identified as Carlos Lopez, 27, who was hit in the face; 
Guillermo Martinez, 21, who was struck in the chest; and Benigno Gonzalez, 25, 
who was struck in the legs. All three are from the Pacoima area, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and Martinez were taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, 
where Lopez was in critical condition and Martinez was in serious but stable 
condition, hospital officials said. Gonzalez was taken to Olive View Medical 
Center and was in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Jay St. John said police found no indication the victims were 
affiliated with gangs. He said they regularly played soccer at Charles Maclay 
Junior High School in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them carry daytime jobs and gather there afterward to play," St. John 
said. "I don't know of many gangsters who spend their nights playing soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the three men had finished playing on the school grounds and walked 
across Pierce Street to use a phone at a service station. While one man used 
the phone and the other two stood nearby, a red car carrying two or three men 
drove slowly by. 
</P>
<P>
"Some sort of gang challenge was spoken by the suspects in the car," St. John 
said. "Then they fired shots. We don't know how many."

9,000 PHONES TEMPORARILY DISCONNECTED IN ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A construction firm digging trenches for new phone cables damaged existing 
phone lines in Palmdale Friday, disrupting service to about 9,000 customers in 
the Littlerock and Lake Los Angeles communities of the eastern Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The outage began about 10 a.m. and affected phones with the 261 and 264 
prefixes in the Lake Los Angeles area and the 944 prefix in Littlerock, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Customers did not lose complete service, but were unable to call outside of 
those prefix areas or receive calls from outside those areas, Pacific Bell 
spokeswoman Charlene Baldwin said. Pacific Bell repair crews had restored 90% 
service by 4 p.m., Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency calls to 911 were rerouted to a switching station, where a Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputy stood by with a radio to handle emergency 
calls. The deputy had received only one 911 call as of 4:30 p.m., sheriff's 
officials said, and no other problems resulting from the outage had been 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin refused to identify the private construction company whose workers 
caused the outage at 47th Street and Palmdale Boulevard in Palmdale, saying the 
telephone company would investigate the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"They were doing excavation in order to lay conduit for new underground 
cables," she said. "They hit our cable and severed part of it." 
</P>
<P>
A crew of about 15 was working to repair the damage, she said. Although she 
predicted full restoration of service by early evening Friday, Baldwin said 
there might be temporary service disruptions after that before all repairs are 
completed.

MOORPARK TO GIVE UP LAND, GET PARK BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The largest residential developer in Moorpark, Urban West Communities, has 
entered into an agreement with the city to build a $1-million community center 
in exchange for permission to expand a proposed commercial center onto land set 
aside for public use. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark City Manager Steve Kueny said the agreement allows the city to have a 
community center that could not have been built "in the near future" because of 
a lack of city funds. 
</P>
<P>
The center, to be built off Tierra Rejada Road southwest of downtown Moorpark, 
will feature a full-size basketball court, a stage, meeting rooms and a 
kitchen. It will be styled after a community building in Borchard Park in 
Newbury Park. Construction should begin next year, said Tom Zanic, Urban West 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The city, in turn, has agreed to allow Urban West, a Santa Monica-based firm 
that developed Mountain Meadows, a 2,500-home planned community, to expand a 
proposed shopping center onto three acres that the developer had set aside for 
public use. 
</P>
<P>
The community-use acreage was required by the city when it gave the nod in 
January, 1988, to the final 1,000 Mountain Meadows homes. The project, to be 
completed in 1992, includes two elementary schools, a new high school, the 
shopping center and a 69-acre park where the community center will be built. 
The new homes will be priced from $300,000 to $450,000, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bend Over Backwards' 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark City Councilman Paul Lawrason, who worked on the four-month 
negotiations, said Urban West had been very generous in the arrangement. "I 
realize that Urban West never does anything from the standpoint of generosity, 
but they did bend over backwards for this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zanic said Urban West's "business in Moorpark happens to be a large one -- and 
it's a risky business of home building -- but our attitude is to be as good a 
community member as one can be." Although he said his company is in business to 
make money, "the good marketplace of the past several years allows us to give 
back to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Relations between Urban West and the city have not always been good. Soon after 
receiving permission to build its final phase, the company sued the city over a 
municipal slow-growth initiative, adopted in 1986, that limits the building of 
residential units to 250 a year. Urban West claimed that it was exempt from the 
process because Mountain Meadows is a planned community. 
</P>
<P>
The court found in favor of Urban West, ruling that the city had granted 
preliminary approval to the entire development before the initiative was 
approved.

GUNSHOT KILLS MAN IN PICKUP TRUCK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A shot fired after an argument between two men in Van Nuys Friday night struck 
and killed a friend of the intended victim, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman fired several shots at a pickup truck carrying the victim and his 
friend on Kester Avenue just south of Victory Boulevard after he and one of the 
pickup's occupants had earlier argued outside the truck, Los Angeles Police 
Sgt. Fred Haptonstal said. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified suspect fled after the shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man's name was not released. Police said it was not immediately known 
if the shooting was gang-related.

MOORPARK MIRROR TO BE SOLD TO RIVAL PAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Moorpark News weekly newspaper has tentatively agreed to purchase its 
cross-town rival, the weekly Moorpark Mirror, for an undisclosed amount, 
according to an announcement made Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The News is jointly owned by two newspaper companies, Harris Enterprises and 
John P. Scripps Newspapers. The Mirror is owned by its publisher, Daniel J. 
Schmidt, who started the News in 1978 before selling it a year later. He 
founded the Mirror in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The News claims that about 1,500 copies of its newspaper are sold weekly, and 
it delivers an additional 1,000 free copies in an effort to spur new 
subscriptions. The Mirror says it has about 500 paid subscribers and circulates 
3,700 free copies. Moorpark's overall population is nearly 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt said there are still several details that need to be worked out before 
the sale can be completed. For example, he said he wants the Mirror to continue 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
Debra W. Ryono, editor and publisher of the News, said the question of whether 
the Mirror remains "is all open for discussion. Nothing is definite yet."

THE DODGERS' PROBLEM? THERE ARE FEW ANSWERS BUT SEVERAL QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's wrong with the 1989 Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
In order of importance: 
</P>
<P>
1. Living in the past, i.e., 1988. 
</P>
<P>
2. Fred Claire's ego. 
</P>
<P>
3. Peter O'Malley's softness. 
</P>
<P>
Living in 1988, example one: Gibson, batting .219 and waiting for Tom Lasorda 
to take him out, which Lasorda will not do. Why not? Because in 1988 Gibson was 
an absolute miracle. Taking Gibson out, even for a week, would help the team 
and help Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
Living in 1988, example two: John Shelby, batting .156. Still, at every 
opportunity Lasorda inserts him, as a pinch-hitter, no less. Why? Because in 
1988 he helped the team. Today, the Dodgers should give him away. Fred Claire: 
He made that swap for John Tudor. So what -- lots of trades turn out poorly. 
But in order to prove it was not a bad trade, he rushed Tudor into the 
rotation, which threw off the entire staff. 
</P>
<P>
Claire will mature when he accepts that some trades work out real well and 
others do not, and it is not required of him to prove over and over how smart 
he is. 
</P>
<P>
Peter O'Malley: He's a nice guy lacking the iron in his soul to bawl out Claire 
when it's needed. After he suffers through a money-losing year (which has not 
happened), he will acquire the steel to be chief executive. Till then, he is a 
pleasant spectator, allowing Claire and Lasorda to screw up the team.

... AND ONE VOTE FOR HIS NATURAL WIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Stewart is wrong again when he says that Ronald Reagan "doesn't do well 
without a script." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's natural wit is legendary. He had no script when he delighted the 
nation with his quips after the attempt on his life in 1981, and he generally 
did well during his presidency answering hostile questions from journalists.

With the departure of columnist Scott Ostler, and the regular use of color art 
(such as it is) in The Times sports section, would it be fair to say that the 
only special feature remaining in the Monday Special is the italic typeface on 
photo captions?

WHITTLETON, MALDONADO TO STUMP FOR SLOW-PITCH SOFTBALL AS EXHIBITION SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
OKLAHOMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The game had been forfeited but Ron Whittleton, who was supposed to umpire, 
just couldn't bring himself to walk away from an empty ball field. 
</P>
<P>
So with an hour to kill, the umpire went to his car, pulled a bag of balls and 
a couple of gloves out of the trunk, returned to the vacant diamond and did 
what he has done countless times in 26 seasons as an amateur athlete. 
</P>
<P>
He practiced pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Were his name Clemens, Gooden or Ryan the sight of Whittleton's pitches arcing 
invitingly toward home plate might have been fairly stimulating. 
</P>
<P>
However, there was about an 85 mile-per-hour difference. 
</P>
<P>
Whittleton is a slow-pitch softball player, meaning his tosses are of the 
underhand variety and cross home plate with an arc of somewhere between six and 
12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
All of which put his workouts right there with "Lassie" reruns on the 
thrill-o-meter. 
</P>
<P>
"I just try and go out there and hit spots," Whittleton says. 
</P>
<P>
Time after time. And knowing all the while that if, by chance, his work should 
pay off and he hits the corners and changes the speed of his offerings just 
right, that he might -- just might -- hold the opposition to, say, only 15 or 
20 runs next time out. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's a hitter's game," Whittleton says with a shrug. "You will get hit." 
</P>
<P>
And rather hard at that. Weather conditions permitting, more than two dozen 
dingers might be swatted during a well-pitched game. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to pitch to a batter's weakness, if he has one," says Whittleton, a 
6-foot-4 right-hander. "Of course, the ball comes in about three miles an hour, 
so as far as weaknesses go it's not like they swing and miss." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they might hit a double instead of a homer, particularly during the 
upcoming week when pitchers will have little margin for error. 
</P>
<P>
Whittleton, a Sepulveda resident, and infielder Manny Maldonado, another 
Valley-area player, will be taking part as slow-pitch softball makes its debut 
as an exhibition sport in the U. S. Olympic Festival, beginning today at Hall 
of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
They will be playing for the South team, which opens against the East at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Whittleton and Maldonado were among the 60 competitors chosen by virtue of 
their performance in last year's American Softball Assn. Super National 
Championships. Both played for Broken Drum Insulation of Northridge, which was 
eliminated from the 16-team tournament after one round. The team disbanded 
shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
The four, 15-man squads participating this week represent the best players 
drafted from the ASA nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Whittleton, 41, is the senior member of the South squad. He took up softball at 
age 15 and has played on championship-caliber teams since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Before this year, the ASA nationals were the highlight of his season. Now he's 
not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
He expects the competition to be fierce despite its "exhibition" tag. 
</P>
<P>
"Intensity is something that's hard to gauge until you get right out there, but 
I do know this," Whittleton says during a pause at practice. "I know there are 
people on this team and the other teams, too, who aren't much on losing. It's 
nice to have a good time and all, but it's even better when you win." 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado, a North Hollywood resident, learned he had been selected in May. And 
at first he wasn't too excited about it, figuring it was "just another 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
"Then I started getting brochures saying who would be here and what was going 
on," he says. "Then I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Whittleton, who played basketball, football and baseball as a youth in 
Medina, N.Y., Maldonado's formative years were spent racing Go-Karts and 
motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
He first played softball in a "beer league" with his father at the age of 16. 
He started at the C division and gradually moved up. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was 20 he was playing five nights a week. But he wasn't getting 
any better. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I found out that working out was more important than playing in so many 
leagues," Maldonado says, "so I worked out twice a week." 
</P>
<P>
Like, with weights? 
</P>
<P>
"No, just hitting," said Maldonado, 5-10, 230 pounds. "I hate lifting weights. 
I hate exercising. I can come here and run 40 laps around the bases without 
getting tired, but if you ask me to run a half-mile I'd be dead." 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado is relatively inexperienced when compared to Whittleton, who has 
traveled to 39 states to take part in various tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Whittleton already is a member of the U. S. Slow-Pitch Softball Assn. Hall of 
Fame. Conversely, six years ago Maldonado was still playing at the B level. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 33, Maldonado, an All World selection last year, is entering his 
prime as a slow-pitch player. He batted .638 and was flawless defensively in 
the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
Whittleton and Maldonado were teammates for three seasons before Broken Drum, 
the only major division team in California, disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
Both still play locally. Whittleton, who was on the road for six consecutive 
weekends taking part in various slow-pitch tournaments, plays in a Wednesday 
night fast-pitch league. He umpires A division slow-pitch on Mondays and 
Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado plays on an A team in Newhall, and also is a member of a co-ed team. 
</P>
<P>
Both shy away from popular unlimited arc slow-pitch leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do that anymore. I can't handle that high stuff," Maldonado says. 
"People would ask me out and tell their friends, 'Hey, I got Manny out. Watch 
him.' Then I'd go out and swing as hard as I can and embarrass myself. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on I'm sticking to what I'm good at."

CARSON FACED TOUGH ODDS FROM THE START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Circumstances may have doomed Dave Carson to failure at Hart High long before 
he was forced to resign after just one season as coach of one of the area's 
most successful football programs. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Laurence Strauss called for Carson's resignation Thursday and then 
installed defensive coordinator Tim Azevedo as interim coach after meeting with 
the staff Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Carson ran a successful program at Burbank for five years before enduring a 
disappointing first season in 1988 in which the Indians finished 6-5, failed to 
win the league title and lost in the first round of the Southern Section 
playoffs. But problems ran deeper than that. Strauss cited philosophical 
differences between himself and Carson, who claims the principal told him he 
must resign because he ran a negative program and used obscene language. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss said Thursday that he reprimanded Carson last year for excessive use of 
profanity with players. At a meeting in April, according to Carson, Strauss 
directed him to create a more positive attitude and clean up his language. 
Carson claims he worked toward those goals, instituting a no-swearing policy on 
the team. He said that he was shocked by his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
"Strauss said I didn't make any changes and was incapable of making changes," 
Carson said. "I'm disappointed that I didn't have ample opportunity to make 
those changes. That hurts. I may not be the right coach for Hart but I still 
know that I'm a good football coach and teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Although his Burbank players support that assertion, some at Hart remain 
unconvinced. They characterize him as an overzealous disciplinarian, a coach 
given to yelling fits who too often pointed out his players' shortcomings while 
overlooking their successes. Quarterback Rob Westervelt, who passed for 2,130 
yards and 21 touchdowns last season as a junior, said that he was relieved when 
he learned of Carson's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sad for him but I'm glad he's not there," he said. "It's the best thing 
for the program. It was evident very early that it wasn't working out. There 
were too many negatives. Everyone was afraid to mess up because you'd get 
yelled at." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Allen, Hart's All-Southern Section tight end who has signed with UCLA, 
echoed those sentiments. "I hate to say this but everyone disliked him," Allen 
said. "We just didn't play well for him. You have to teach kids, not just yell 
at them. There was always a lot of tension in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Some of that tension may have preceded Carson. He replaced the popular Rick 
Scott, an easygoing man with a folksy touch with his players. He frequently 
punctuated practices with jokes and made sure his players enjoyed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Scott also was a winner. In the four seasons before he resigned to coach Buena 
High in Ventura, he led Hart to four consecutive Foothill League titles and 20 
consecutive league wins, including four over Burbank. He also coached the 
Indians to the Southern Section Northwestern Conference championship in 1986 
and compiled a 41-9-2 record before moving to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have hired Don Shula or Vince Lombardi reincarnated and he would 
have a tough time following Rick Scott," Canyon Coach Harry Welch said. "Carson 
is a very intelligent coach with a great football mind but is obviously more 
the disciplinarian than Scott." 
</P>
<P>
Players chafed under Carson's rule but they had a gripe before he arrived. 
After Scott resigned, a group representing the players asked Strauss to hire 
popular assistant coach Mike Herrington and his brothers Rick and Dean, but 
when Strauss chose Carson, he may have inadvertently stacked the deck against 
his new coach. 
</P>
<P>
"The players wanted the Herringtons and people didn't like Carson from the 
beginning," said Brian LaMarre, last year's starting defensive tackle and an 
assistant freshman coach this year. "After the first game, the players shut him 
off. They thought they could do it on their own. The players are spoiled. When 
they didn't get their way, they'd go cry to their parents who would talk to 
Strauss. Sometimes as a person Coach Carson got on my nerves, but I thought he 
was a great coach." 
</P>
<P>
Carson didn't help his cause when he directed a a racial slur at Howard 
Blackwell, a black running back, after he fumbled during a game last year 
against Schurr. Carson said he immediately apologized to Blackwell and later 
apologized to him in front of the team. 
</P>
<P>
Carson says that he is free from racism and regrets hurting Blackwell. "I made 
a mistake and took appropriate action by saying I was sorry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank lineman John Cotti, who played for Carson as a junior and will play for 
Cal State Fullerton this fall, remembers a different man from the one portrayed 
by some Hart players. 
</P>
<P>
"He was there for you if you needed him," he said. "His players came first and 
he made us feel special. He had a lot of discipline and didn't put up with crap 
from anyone, but that's why we had a good team. I liked him a lot and I'd play 
for him again." 
</P>
<P>
Carson, 41, wants another chance to convince players he has those coaching 
skills. He sold his house in Pasadena and moved to Saugus when he took the Hart 
job. He has a contract to teach physical education there this school year but 
will look for other coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
His faith in his coaching abilities remains unshaken and he regrets that he was 
denied more time to sell the Hart players on his program. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a different personality than what they were used to and it was a 
difficult adjustment for them," he said. "The Burbank kids bought my program, 
but the Hart kids never did. 
</P>
<P>
"They may have looked down on me because Hart always beat us at Burbank. One 
kid asked me what was the most games I won in a season. I told him seven and 
these kids were used to winning 10, 11, 12 games a year. I don't think I 
convinced the kids that I could lead them to a championship. I had to earn my 
rite of passage and I don't think they ever accepted me." 
</P>
<P>
Azevedo, 32, joined Hart last year after five years as an assistant at St. 
Joseph High in Santa Maria, his alma mater. He also served as an assistant for 
three years at Eastern Oregon State College where he was as an offensive 
lineman. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss said that Azevedo will run the program until the first week of August 
and that any future hire would also be on an interim basis. Next year, Strauss 
said, a permanent coach would be selected after interviews and a full-scale 
background check. 
</P>
<P>
"The position will be interim, whether its someone from outside our staff or 
within our staff," he said. "Because of the time element, there's no way we can 
implement the normal selection process."

REISNER'S VERSATILITY SAVES WOODLAND HILLS EAST, 5-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brett Reisner came through in the fifth with his glove, and then with his bat. 
And thanks to his efforts, his Woodland Hills East teammates are alive to play 
another day in the District 20 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Reisner made an over-the-shoulder catch in left field to save at least two runs 
and then lined a two-run single in the bottom of the inning to lead East to a 
5-1 win Friday over Encino-Crespi in a third-round consolation-bracket at 
Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
With two Encino-Crespi runners aboard and East leading, 3-0, Reisner made a 
catch in deep left of Chris Romero's drive. His single in the bottom of the 
inning gave East pitcher Eric Rothman a couple of insurance runs. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman (4-3), a right-hander, pitched eight scoreless innings, allowing seven 
hits. He walked one and struck out none. 
</P>
<P>
East (15-10) will play Newhall-Saugus today at 11 a.m. at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Shapiro, Reisner and Allen Puana each had two hits for East. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Mark Venturine had two hits for Encino-Crespi, which finished 14-11. 
</P>
<P>
In another District 20 playoff game: 
</P>
<P>
Newhall-Saugus 4, Lancaster 2 -- Outfielder Ben Ealy was five for five and 
scored two runs in a third-round consolation game at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Scott Warr (3-3) threw a seven-hitter, struck out three and walked 
six. It was his third victory over Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Byars was two for five with an RBI for Newhall-Saugus (19-6), which plays 
Woodland Hills East today at 11 a.m. at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall-Saugus will start right-hander Doug Maggiora.

MOTIVATED WOODLAND HILLS WEST ROMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ah, incentives. Let us count the ways these personal inducements affected 
Woodland Hills West in its 11-3 pasting Friday of Panorama City in an American 
Legion District 20 championship-bracket playoff game at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
First, we had West right-hander Lance Gibson, who was gunning for his 20th 
career Legion victory. Not a bad objective to have as the playoffs roll around. 
</P>
<P>
Second, there was shortstop Ricky Banuelos, who was ejected from a second-round 
game Thursday for throwing a bat -- and not at a baseball. Not a personal 
highlight. 
</P>
<P>
Third, there was the ever-popular championship bye in today's round, which goes 
to the team that starts the double-elimination tournament with a 3-0 record. In 
other words, West gets to sit in lawn chairs today, sip a few cold ones and 
watch three other teams fight sunburn and smog as they burn even more of their 
own pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Previous embarrassment is always good for an extra kick in the double-knits, 
too. Last season, West was the top-seeded team in the playoffs but was 
eliminated in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Factor in poor offensive outings in its first two playoff games and top-seeded 
West had all the edge it needed to pound three different Panorama City pitchers 
for 13 hits. West (22-3) now advances to Sunday's play. It would have to lose 
twice to blow a berth in the 6th Area playoffs, which begin next week at 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the pressure's on the other teams to come back," said Gibson, who threw a 
six-hitter, improved to 7-1 and became only the second District 20 pitcher this 
decade to win 20 games. "We haven't been swept in a doubleheader all year, and 
now every other team has to win three in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Panorama City (19-5) will play the winner of today's 11 a.m. game 
between Newhall-Saugus and Woodland Hills East today at 3 p.m. All three teams 
are 2-1 in tournament play and would have to beat West twice on Sunday for the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
West pummeled Panorama City right-hander Dave Unter (5-1) for nine earned runs 
in 4 2/3 innings, after he had allowed just 12 earned runs in 48 1/3 innings 
all year. 
</P>
<P>
West scored three times in the first inning, once in the second and once in the 
third to take a 5-1 lead. Panorama City, however, made its one big run at 
Gibson in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
With a runner aboard and West leading, 5-2, West center fielder Carl McFadden 
fought off the sun to rob Shane Wight with a two-out, diving catch at the fence 
in left-center, saving at least one run. With West's offense scoring four times 
in the fifth to take a 9-2 lead, it was all over. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (McFadden) I was glad he followed it all the way," said Gibson, who 
struck out nine and walked four. "That was a spectacular play." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Banuelos threw the bat around, but this time, he did it in the 
batter's box. Banuelos was four for five, drove in two runs and scored two 
more. He was one of six West starters to drive in at least one run. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out here to redeem myself," Banuelos said. 
</P>
<P>
A catchy team theme, or what?

DAVE DISTEL: IF BILLY JOE IS SO GOOD, WHAT WERE THE CHARGERS WAITING FOR?

Dan Henning was kidding, I think, when he walked into a conference room packed 
with writers and sportscasters and said: "This is more guys than we'll have in 
camp." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the football season, in its own way, is about to begin. Training camp 
opens today for Charger rookies and free agents and a handful of veterans. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was Thursday as Henning was talking, and a total of 21 players were 
still unsigned. In fact, none of the nine draft choices had yet signed. 
</P>
<P>
Henning, about to begin his first year as the Chargers' head coach, thus could 
be excused for wondering exactly what players he would be coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Would this team with a ghost of a chance in the AFC West begin training with a 
ghost of a team? 
</P>
<P>
It became obvious, once Henning had worked his way through the litany of camp 
procedures, that one position and one person concerned him most. 
</P>
<P>
As you might have guessed, the position is quarterback. Anyone who has watched 
the Chargers since Dan Fouts retired could come to that conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
And this year's cast of characters at quarterback includes (a) the AFC's 
lowest-ranked passer the past two years, (b) a promising youngster coming off a 
devastating knee injury, (c) a veteran who will answer no one's prayers and (d) 
an untried rookie drafted near the bottom of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
It was hard to imagine that any of these people would have dominated Henning's 
pre-training camp observations. 
</P>
<P>
But Billy Joe Tolliver, who comes under the heading of untried rookie, was the 
man of that hour. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joe Tolliver? 
</P>
<P>
The impression I got from Henning is that there is no more pressing business 
for Steve Ortmayer, the director of football operations, than getting Billy Joe 
Tolliver under contract and into camp. 
</P>
<P>
This is rather heady stuff when it is considered that Tolliver was not the 
first player the Chargers took in the draft. Burt Grossman was. Tolliver was 
not the second player the Chargers took in the draft. Courtney Hall was. And it 
was not that both of them already were signed, because neither was. 
</P>
<P>
It also was noteworthy that stars such as Gary Anderson and Lionel James were 
unsigned, as were 10 other veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joe Tolliver seems to be an obsession with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
I can think of two possible reasons: 
</P>
<P>
* He is a marvelously skilled quarterback who represents the future (and maybe 
even the present) of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
* The coaches are mortified at the prospect of trying to win (or even be 
respectable) with any of the other three. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that this is a marvelously skilled "instant quarterback" is belied 
by the fact that he was the 51st player selected in the draft. If he is that 
good, there are 28 stupid teams in the National Football League. I include the 
Chargers, because it would have been stupid to let anyone that good slip past 
their first second-round selection. 
</P>
<P>
It is a little more understandable that the Chargers would be, to say the 
least, greatly concerned about being competitive with bottom-ranked Mark 
Malone, rehabilitating Mark Vlasic or journeyman David Archer. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, almost anyone else looks prettier. 
</P>
<P>
Is that Billy Joe Tolliver's charm? Is he pretty or just prettier? Is he an 
answer just because everyone else is a question? 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Henning went on and on about the importance of Tolliver being at UC 
San Diego today. It was almost as if he was portraying Tolliver as a son who 
had gotten in with a bad crowd, the "bad influence" in this case being agent 
Vic Vines. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Billy Joe will be making an error if he doesn't come in here on time," 
Henning said. "And his agent would be making a superior mistake if he doesn't 
work things out." 
</P>
<P>
The agent, of course, represents only one side of the negotiating process. And 
Vines has been paying attention to all the rhetoric about just how wonderful 
the Chargers think his client might be. Coincidentally, I am sure he has hiked 
the price tag just a bit (maybe a big bit) in response. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' problem, as I see it, is that they now must pay the price for 
their own selling job. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they have been just a little bit overanxious and overzealous in their 
assessment of Billy Joe. Maybe they should have introduced him as a 
developmental project. Maybe they should have yawned and said the kid QB from 
Texas Tech would do a good job carrying the clipboard for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe, just maybe, they were (and are) panicked over the quarterback 
situation. They don't need someone to carry a clipboard. They desperately need 
someone who can carry the team, or at least move it.

KING BREAKS TWO WORLD MARKS, WANTS TO GO FASTER YET

San Diego's James King didn't look or sound like someone who has broken two 
Masters track world records in two days and three in two weeks. As the 
public-address announcer showered him with accolades, King shook his head and 
talked about what a pitiful race he had run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating," King said after running a world age-group record of 53.56 
seconds Friday afternoon to win the men's 40-44 400-meter hurdles at the 
TAC/USA National Masters Track &amp; Field Championships. "I was too close on 
my second hurdle, and it changed everything. I chopped almost everything after 
that. I wasted a lot of effort trying to recoup." 
</P>
<P>
King came back Friday evening and set a world 40-44 record in the flat 400 
meters, running 48.61 to erase the 48.75 of France's Roger Hagues. 
</P>
<P>
But the man who twice just missed going to the Olympics in the 400 hurdles was 
frustrated by his failure to go faster in his specialty. Two weeks ago, King, 
40, broke the previous 40-44 record world record of 54.01 with a 53.88. It was 
evident he was looking to go much lower than 53 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty-two should have been there today; I just didn't take it," he said. "I 
was thinking too much about the record instead of just running through. I think 
51 was possible. I can run a 48 (second) 400 meters, and you're supposed to add 
three seconds for the hurdles. So 51 can definitely be reached." 
</P>
<P>
Who does this guy think he is, Edwin Moses? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for a while there, King felt as if he was at least good enough to beat 
Moses. 
</P>
<P>
"I came close twice," King said. "You had to surprise Edwin. Edwin was the 
money-maker, we figured if you beat Edwin, you'd be in the money too." 
</P>
<P>
King ran a modest 51.44 in the intermediate hurdles while at San Diego State in 
1971 but by 1975 was in his prime, winning the event at the Pam Am Games. He 
was the ranked No. 3 in the world heading into the 1976 Olympic Trials, but two 
weeks beforehand pulled a muscle in his leg. He went on to finish a 
disappointing sixth in the final. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, King and Andre Phillips were running a comfortable second and third 
behind Moses, but misfortune struck on the last hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
"Phillips hit his hurdle and rolled off into my lane," King said. "I never 
recovered, and two guys passed us. We both had the team made, and he screwed it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the 1983 Pan Am Games in Caracas, Venezuela, when King became 
disillusioned with track. King said drugs were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It shocked me," he said. "I couldn't believe so many people I knew were on 
drugs. I was basically running at a handicap. That was really the final blow." 
</P>
<P>
That actually came in 1984, when King was knocked out of the Olympic Trials in 
the preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
"After '80, I just figured, it's not meant to be," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Did King every consider using performance enhancing drugs? 
</P>
<P>
"The money in Europe got real good," he said. "A lot of guys wanted to get that 
edge, and they had to turn to drugs. I thought about (taking drugs) in Caracas, 
but I was too old for it. I didn't know how it would change my body." 
</P>
<P>
These days, King's body seems to be unchanged. In fact, just a year after '84 
Olympic Trials, he was breaking the Masters world record in the 35-39 age 
category with a 46.3 in the flat 400 at age 36. 
</P>
<P>
"That record will stand for a while," King said with a bit of smugness. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was somewhat hesitant at first to continue his track career, King 
is now setting his sights on every record he can reach. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the 45 (age group) record, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
King says that with his new training techniques, no record is safe. 
</P>
<P>
"If knew then what I know now, I could think I could have done a lot more," he 
said. "My workouts are completely different now. I also know my body a lot 
better now. You learn how to back off and get through the pain barriers." 
</P>
<P>
How long will he continue to fight through them? 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I can run," said King, who is a cook at the San Diego Princess 
Hotel and a part-time assistant track coach at San Diego City College. "I like 
it. It's a clean sport. It's not a business. Everybody is running on their 
ability here."

RECORDS DROPPING AT MASTERS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW ZEALANDER RUNS BEST IN 800 METERS, AND FINAL STILL TO COME

There were several U.S. and world age-group records set at the second day of 
the TAC/USA Masters National Track and Field Championships at San Diego State 
Friday, but perhaps none was as surprising as that of 62-year-old Derek 
Turnbull in the men's 60-64 800 meters. 
</P>
<P>
It was surprising because the race in which Turnbull set the world record of 
2:14.90 was only a qualifying heat, in which one usually breezes to the final, 
where it's then time to kick in the afterburners. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising, too, because Turnbull would have been expected to save something 
for the 400-meter final he was to run just a couple hours later. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, it came as a surprise because it would be assumed that Turnbull 
must conserve some energy for today's 1,500 and 5,000 meters, both of which he 
is scheduled to run. 
</P>
<P>
So why, then, would Turnbull go all out so early in the meet? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," a somewhat bashful Turnbull replied, "I didn't intend to . . . I knew 
I'd have another chance on Sunday (in the finals), but as I was coming down the 
stretch, I saw the clock and knew I was within reach, so I decided it was worth 
a lick." 
</P>
<P>
And besides, it wasn't that much of a chore, at least not compared to the work 
on Turnbull's 600-acre farm on the south island of New Zealand, where he herds 
2,000 head of sheep and 150 head of cattle. Herds? Actually, that's how he 
trains, and he claims the farm work is the secret of his success. 
</P>
<P>
"If you enjoy your training, you'll get your results," he said. "But if you 
don't enjoy your training, you'll become bored and get no results at all." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Turnbull, the records broken by San Diego's James King were somewhat 
expected. King ran in his first Masters Championships in the 40-44 age group 
and set two world records on the day. 
</P>
<P>
The first was in the 400-meter hurdles, where he ran 53.56; the second was in 
the 400 meters, which he won in 48.61. 
</P>
<P>
Another American, Irene Obera from Palo Alto, also ran her first races in a 
higher age group, the 55-59 group, and claimed one American record and one 
world mark. 
</P>
<P>
Her U.S. record came in the 100 meters. Her 13.84 missed the 13.6 world mark of 
Australia's Shirley Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the afternoon, Obera managed a world record of 1:08.41 in the 400 
meters, beating the 1:08.6 run by Australia's Daphne Pirie in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
While Turnbull was apologetic about his record, Obera didn't even want to 
acknowledge her's. 
</P>
<P>
"My main goal is to just try to get loose for next week (when the World Masters 
Championships will be held in Eugene, Ore.)," Obera said after her 100-meter 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after her 400 win, she said, "I run to place, not for a record." 
</P>
<P>
Added her coach, Enver Mehmedbasich, "Irene runs to place. Records are there if 
it is required she runs that fast." 
</P>
<P>
What runner and coach prefered to speak of was the fact that the races were her 
first of the year after she battled some heel problems during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
"To run her first quarter (400 meters) of the year at that pace," Mehmedbasich 
said, "is quite an accomplishment. Hopefully she'll do even better next week."

BUSH CALL FOR MARS MISSION SEEN AS RHETORIC; 
</P>
<P>
BUT S.D. PHYSICIST FINDS PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT OF PROGRAM A MILESTONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the opinion of Bruce M. Cordell, a physicist who studies advanced space 
systems planning for General Dynamics' San Diego-based Space Systems Division, 
President Bush's call this week for a manned mission to Mars was heavy on 
rhetoric and light on substance. 
</P>
<P>
"You could argue that this was the most minimal statement that a president 
could make" and still support a manned Mars mission, Cordell said Friday. "But 
it would be unfair to characterize (Bush's initiative) as being totally devoid 
of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Several Democratic congressmen have done just that: One lambasted Bush for a 
proposal that contained "no money, no timetable and no plan." Another 
legislator, mindful of the program's multibillion-dollar price tag, quipped 
that "there is no such thing as a free launch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faced With Lunar Landing Anniversary 
</P>
<P>
Cordell on Friday speculated that Bush "was faced with the 20th anniversary of 
the lunar landing, and he wanted to make a public statement." Unfortunately, 
"NASA is simply not ready to unveil its detailed plan" for a Mars trip, 
according to Cordell. That detailed space plan won't be available until the 
early 1990s, said Cordell, a former physics professor who joined General 
Dynamics five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bush on Thursday used the 20th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's moonwalk to 
propose a three-pronged space program that includes an Earth-orbiting space 
station , a moon-based scientific station and a manned mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Bush's speech marked a milestone, despite its "bare-bones approach," 
Cordell said. "For the first time ever, an American president has publicly 
endorsed a manned Mars mission," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agnew Made Similar Proposal 
</P>
<P>
Bush's endorsement of a Mars mission came 20 years after then-Vice President 
Spiro T. Agnew, who headed a space task force, made a similar proposal, Cordell 
said. "Needless to say, that got swamped in the Vietnam War and Watergate." 
</P>
<P>
Cordell believes that Americans will look past the enormous -- but as yet, 
undetermined cost -- and embrace what Bush described as a "journey into 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
"I find tremendous interest in the prospect of humans exploring the solar 
system, particularly in Mars colonization," said Cordell, who regularly talks 
about space missions "before all types of groups -- from kids in school to 
military groups and Rotary clubs." 
</P>
<P>
Although opponents will balk at the cost, Cordell argued that "a Mars program 
is not a budget-busting program . . . it's not something that will bankrupt the 
U. S. Rather, it's an investment in the future of the United States and of 
global civilization." 
</P>
<P>
A manned Mars mission would be "the greatest human adventure of our time," 
Cordell said in a speech earlier this month during an American Institute of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Mars mission offers "important new scientific knowledge, a 
compelling stimulus for technological growth, potentially great economic return 
. . . a chance for improved international relations, and a profound opportunity 
for the evolution of human civilization and consciousness into the cosmos," 
Cordell said during that speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenging, Risky Mission 
</P>
<P>
Cordell's grand description of a Mars mission's benefits doesn't ignore the 
fact that a manned Mars mission would be expensive, technologically challenging 
and risky. 
</P>
<P>
To limit risk, Cordell cautioned against turning the Mars mission into a "space 
race" between the United States and Russia. That warning echoed former 
astronaut Sally Ride's 1987 statement that a space race to Mars could 
compromise astronaut safety. 
</P>
<P>
Ride in the fall will become director of the of the California Space Institute 
on the UC San Diego campus. Ride has repeatedly urged national policy planners 
to establish a permanent lunar research outpost and to develop a coordinated, 
long-term space exploration plan. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not developed, the space program will be fragmented," Ride said in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Cordell suggested that "a 'moon-first' philosophy . . . (would be) more 
consistent with the incremental increases in mission difficulty and risk that 
were evident during the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs." 
</P>
<P>
If the United States does mount a Mars mission, he said, there would be several 
challenges: 
</P>
<P>
* Medical experts must deal with the effects of "microgravity" upon astronauts' 
bones, muscles and cell tissue during the two-to-four-year Mars mission. 
</P>
<P>
* Waste recycling would be critical during a Mars mission because space 
limitations would prohibit astronauts from stocking and maintaining an adequate 
supply of air, water and food. 
</P>
<P>
* Doctors are studying the effects of radiation, which will be 100 times 
heavier than levels encountered during Apollo lunar missions. 
</P>
<P>
* During the years-long adventure, astronauts will face all of the leading 
causes of death -- cancer, heart attack, suicide, trauma, etc. -- facing their 
fellow earthlings. 
</P>
<P>
* Social scientists also are studying how a highly trained group would react to 
an "isolated and confined" space ship. They also are studying "the slightly 
touchy subject of sex in space" because there is a "high likelihood of 
mixed-gender crews," Cordell said.

Former San Diego Urban League President Herb Cawthorne unveiled his new venture 
Friday -- a for-profit development company "with a social philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
In a luncheon speech Friday, Cawthorne, who resigned his Urban League post June 
7 amid rumors of financial improprieties and conflict within the organization, 
championed free enterprise as a means of solving inner-city problems. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne said economic development is the key issue for minorities and backed 
the creation of "free enterprise zones." Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Jack Kemp recently proposed tax breaks and other incentives for 
businesses relocating to such zones in underdeveloped neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital will not come here because it is sentimental," Cawthorne told an 
audience of community leaders and corporate executives. "Capital will come 
because it gets a return. I want to make the return here better than any place 
else in San Diego."

<P>
The newly established Cawthorne Co. will "improve the opportunity to create 
wealth in (the) community" by developing Southeast San Diego, Cawthorne said. 
The business, now operating out of a church, is still looking for a permanent 
home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cawthorne opposed tough development curbs sought by slow-growth 
activists and argued in favor of a less restrictive proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Business investment can cure many of the social ills afflicting San Diego, 
Cawthorne said. "Education and health care are not social work problems, they 
are business and economic problems," he said in his speech before the Logan 
Heights Family Health Center Foundation. "Social work is important, but you 
feel like you are walking on a treadmill," he later added. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne refused comment on his resignation from the Urban League, and on last 
Tuesday's departure of league chairwoman Carolyn Smith after a four-week 
tenure. He has previously said that Smith left because she lacked the support 
of Urban League board members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Move Beyond Controversy' 
</P>
<P>
"The Urban league was not made up of Herb Cawthorne, or of any single member of 
the board," Cawthorne said in his address. "It should move beyond controversy 
to provide the services needed in the community." 
</P>
<P>
School Principal Cecilia Estrada introduced Cawthorne as "a man who will always 
be controversial because he is willing to take risks." She later said she was 
referring to Cawthorne's stands on public issues, rather than to "that Urban 
League fight." 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Cawthorne "is very effective, and his ideas are excellent, but he 
just takes on the issues that aren't popular with the majority." 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne pledged Friday to start an association of small businessmen in free 
enterprise zones, and to seek such zone designations for parts of the downtown 
and much of Southeast San Diego. He also said he would lobby in Sacramento and 
Washington to require greater bank lending in the poor neighborhoods, and seek 
to revitalize Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
"If San Diego is to remain a strong and powerful city, if its businesses are to 
continue to grow . . . you need the black and the Hispanic community," 
Cawthorne said. "You cannot have one part of the community that's bleeding."

NO SENTENCE YET FROM LUCAS JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors deciding the fate of multiple murderer David Lucas went home for the 
weekend Friday without reaching a decision on whether to sentence him to death. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is expected to resume deliberations Monday morning. It apparently was 
dismissed about 11 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters and the public were excluded from the courtroom by Superior Court 
Judge Laura Hammes, and it was not known what occurred during the closed 
hearings attended by lawyers in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, 34, a Spring Valley carpet cleaner, was found guilty by the same jury 
June 21 of the first-degree murder of two women and a child and the attempted 
murder of a third woman. 
</P>
<P>
The jury will decide whether to sentence Lucas to death or life in prison 
without parole.

MINISTER IN PLOT TO BOMB ABORTION CLINIC WILL GET OUT OF PRISON EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Dorman Owens, who was convicted in the attempted bombing of a San 
Diego abortion clinic, will be released from prison in the next few days after 
serving 16 months of a 21-month sentence, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, 55, is the former pastor of the fundamentalist Bible Missionary 
Fellowship in Santee. He and several of his followers were implicated in an 
unsuccessful attempt to bomb the Family Planning Associates Medical Group on 
Alvarado Road in July, 1987. A church member placed an explosive charge in the 
building, but it failed to detonate. 
</P>
<P>
Owens was sentenced last July to 21 months in prison after pleading guilty to 
lying about the bomb plot and tampering with a federal witness. He received 
credit for four months he served in prison before his sentencing and for good 
behavior, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Learned His Lesson' 
</P>
<P>
A federal prosecutor in the case said Friday that he believed Owens has 
"learned his lesson." Owens will begin serving five years' probation upon his 
release from the federal prison at Terminal Island near San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping for the best," said Larry Burns, an assistant U. S. attorney. "He 
kept a low profile while he was in prison. I don't think he'll violate the 
terms of his probation." 
</P>
<P>
Under those terms, Owens is prohibited from participating in anti-abortion or 
anti-homosexual demonstrations, Burns said. He is also barred from encouraging 
others to picket clinics that provide abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Rominger, acting executive director of Womancare, a San Diego clinic that 
was routinely picketed by Owens and his group, said she was "sorry to see he's 
getting out." She said she believes Owens will continue to encourage others to 
shut down clinics that provide abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to believe he has been rehabilitated," Rominger said. "The 
most frightening thing is that he still has friends and acquaintances that are 
active in Operation Rescue. He has connections involved with the present 
harassment and blockades." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue, a national anti-abortion campaign, has gained widespread 
attention for its practice of forming human blockades to prevent women from 
entering clinics that provide abortions and for its participants' willingness 
to go to jail for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
Owens' release during a time of heightened anti-abortion activity following the 
recent Supreme Court decision on the issue was "very bad timing," Rominger 
said. "We hope San Diego police are going to do their duties and make sure 
these kinds of things don't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Warwick, Owens' attorney, declined to give the pastor's release date. 
</P>
<P>
"My client has instructed me not to discuss his case," Warwick said. "He just 
wants to stay out of the public eye. He doesn't want any more publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Of five others convicted in connection with the attempted bombing, two are 
still in custody and another is about to begin serving his sentence, Burns 
said. Eric Svelmoe, who planted the bomb, and Jo Anne Kreipal, a mother of two, 
have completed their terms, Burns said.

WITNESS SAYS HUNTER WAS ANGRY AT BEING EXCLUDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Hoover Hunter complained about being shut out of a closed-door meeting 
conducted in the office she shared with J. David (Jerry) Dominelli at 
Dominelli's investment company, according to testimony Friday in Hunter's fraud 
and tax-evasion trial. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Hart, former executive assistant to Dominelli and Hunter, said that 
Dominelli occasionally excluded Hunter from meetings in the year before the J. 
David &amp; Co. investment firm collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by defense attorney Richard Marmaro, Hart testified 
about a 1983 meeting attended by Mark Yarry, a top J. David salesman who faces 
a 26-count indictment stemming from the firm's huge Ponzi scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"The door slammed, and Nancy Hoover came out," Hart said. She "was angry, 
visibly and vocally, about being excluded from the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Hart testified that her desk was outside the spacious office shared by 
Dominelli and Hunter at J. David's La Jolla headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said she could not remember Hunter's exact words, but "the substance was 
that she had been excluded from a meeting and she didn't like Jerry doing that 
to her when she was supposed to be a principal of the firm." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is on trial in the federal court of District Judge Earl B. Gilliam in 
San Diego on a 234-count indictment that alleges she played a key role in the 
Ponzi scheme. Dominelli is serving a 20-year prison term for his part in the 
fraud.

The conversion of KKGO to a classical format will have no impact on the jazz

One waits in vain for Charlie Parker, Art Tatum, Lester Young, etc., only to

'PHANTOM' INSIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Charles Champlin's July 11 column, "Catching Up With the 'Phantom': A Night 
of Opera," in which a friend asks him what "The Phantom of the Opera" is all 
about: 
</P>
<P>
 May I make a suggestion to those planning to attend the stage musical? Before 
seeing "Phantom" in New York, I read Gaston Leroux's original story (available 
in paperback), and this made all the characters and stage interpretation clear 
and recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
To fully appreciate later what one has experienced, read the book "The Complete 
Phantom of the Opera" by George Percy (available in stores and some libraries). 
This book is magnificent in historical content, color photographs and 
descriptions of costuming and staging. The libretto is included. 
</P>
<P>
I plan to see "Phantom" again. It is not "canned soup," as Times critic Dan 
Sullivan has said, but rather nectar of the gods.

IRVINE MEADOWS PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a rock concert on July 8, it took me 2 3/4 hours to get out of the 
parking lot of Irvine Meadows Amphitheater. This was a deterioration from two 
months earlier, when it took just under two hours to get out after a show. 
</P>
<P>
Once the concert managers have our ticket money and concessions money, they 
don't seem to care what happens to us; after all, we are a captive audience 
when the concert is over.

A DANCE OF THE SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the excellent article by Chris Pasles on the Tibetan Buddhist 
monks from Namgyal Monastery ("Tibetan Monks to Dance a Protest of Brutality at 
Home," July 17). It is unfortunate, however, that the headline misrepresents 
the monks' motivation for performing their ritual dances at UCLA and on their 
forthcoming U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
As the article itself indicates, Tibetan Buddhist rituals are spiritual 
activities performed to eliminate negative states of mind and to generate 
happiness and peace. These dances are not performed as a form of political 
protest.

PUBLIC RECORDS LED SUSPECT TO ACTRESS-VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT WELKOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old "obsessed fan" accused of murdering Rebecca Schaeffer at her Los 
Angeles apartment house had hired private investigators in his hometown of 
Tucson to track down where the young actress lived, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks before Schaeffer's killing, Robert John Bardo walked into the Anthony 
Agency, a Tucson firm that advertises its ability to find missing persons, and 
showed private investigators a studio publicity photo of the television and 
film actress, Los Angeles police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of the firm told The Times that Bardo had said Schaeffer was an old 
friend and he wanted her current address so he could send her a gift. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he had been writing letters to her in the past and he wanted a current 
mailing address," recalled William Johnson, who works for the investigation 
firm but did not personally handle the case. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the photograph of Schaeffer that Bardo carried contained her 
signature and a personal message scribbled on the print by the actress. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he knew her from some (Hollywood) studios," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The private investigators said they had no knowledge that Bardo may have been 
intent on killing Schaeffer: "Naturally," said Johnson, "if they knew what he 
would do, they wouldn't have taken the case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$250 Fee 
</P>
<P>
For a fee of $250, the private investigators contacted a person in California, 
whom they refused to identify, and asked that person to find Schaeffer's 
address through public records. 
</P>
<P>
"We just made a request of someone over there (in California) to do a check," 
Johnson said. "Apparently, they got a driver's license with an address." 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Motor Vehicles, for a nominal fee, regularly 
provides driver's license information to the public. Authorities said that it 
is virtually impossible to fully shield a person's residence if it exists in 
public records. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have all left a paper trail, be it voter records, tax or motor 
vehicle records," said LAPD homicide detective Dan Andrews. "If a person is 
inquisitive enough, that trail can be found." 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer, 21, who co-starred in the TV series "My Sister Sam" and recently 
appeared in the film "Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills," was 
shot to death Tuesday morning at the glass security door to her Fairfax 
District apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seized in Tucson 
</P>
<P>
Bardo, a high school dropout who worked occasionally at fast-food outlets, was 
arrested the next day in Tucson as he walked into oncoming traffic on a 
downtown highway. 
</P>
<P>
Bardo is being held in a Tucson jail on $1-million bail, awaiting an Aug. 18 
extradition hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said that the Tucson private investigators called police and said they 
had been contacted June 5 by Bardo. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, Bardo had sent a stream of fan letters to Schaeffer. Recently, 
authorities said, he mailed an ominous-sounding letter to his sister in 
Knoxville, Tenn., indicating that if he could not have the actress, no one 
would. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of Schaeffer said her assailant had pulled out her photo and asked if 
they knew the exact building where she lived. Police suspect he was guided to 
the street by the information he purchased from the private investigators, but 
may have been unsure of the specific building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Exceptions 
</P>
<P>
With some exceptions, California law states that "every person has a right to 
inspect any public record." The exceptions are home addresses of judges and 
peace officers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, California legislators were angered when a Northern 
California newspaper obtained the driving records of each lawmaker. But, DMV 
officials said, there was nothing they could do but release the information. 
</P>
<P>
DMV officials said the records of 19 million licensed drivers are open to the 
public for inspection under state law. 
</P>
<P>
For as little as $1, a person can go into any of the DMV's 170 field offices, 
fill out Form 70 stating who they are, what person they want information on, 
the reason they are requesting the information and how they intend to use it. 
The information is delivered on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
During the last year, more than 16 million requests were made by the general 
public for driver and vehicle information in California, according to the DMV. 
Many requests are made to verify information supplied by job applicants, loan 
seekers and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone comes in and says, 'We have a class or armed forces reunion and we 
need this information,' we are going to say, 'That is an acceptable reason,' 
and give out the information," said DMV spokesman Bill Gengler. 
</P>
<P>
But, Gengler added, "If a person comes in and says a driver has made an obscene 
gesture and they want to get the driver's license because they are mad at them, 
or they saw a person in a car and want to get together with them socially, they 
would be turned down." 
</P>
<P>
DMV employees are told not to release information if they believe the applicant 
might seek to harass or harm someone else. But officials concede that, as with 
any form, people can lie. 
</P>
<P>
Gengler said he doubts there would have been any way to stop Bardo from getting 
the information if it came through legitimate channels. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any way this particular person could have been 
protected from this because of the public information laws and the way they are 
written."

PRODDED BY STRIKES, HE CALLS FOR 'NEW BLOOD' TO OUST PARTY CONSERVATIVES

<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with worsening ethnic and labor unrest, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
appeared Friday to be turning to new and more radical tactics in his struggle 
to reform the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to regional Communist Party leaders published in Friday's issue of 
Pravda, Gorbachev made his strongest attack yet on the party conservatives he 
accuses of frustrating his policy of perestroika, or restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"The ranks of party officials need an infusion of fresh blood," Gorbachev said, 
emphasizing that the renewal is required "at all levels" from basic party 
organizations up through the 13-man ruling Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strikes a Factor in Decision 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a member of Gorbachev's inner circle of economic advisers confirmed 
in an interview that strikes by Soviet coal miners were a factor in Gorbachev's 
announcement, at the same party conference, of plans to import consumer goods 
valued at 10 billion rubles -- $16 billion at the official rate of exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision to import consumer goods definitely was speeded up by the 
strikes, although discussions on the subject were under way a long time ago," 
said Nikolai Y. Petrakov, deputy director of the Central Institute of 
Mathematical-Economic Research and a deputy in the newly reconstituted 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The reputedly stormy party meeting was held earlier this week, but Gorbachev's 
remarks were not made public until Friday. His implied threat to purge 
conservatives from the party, as well as the decision to import consumer goods, 
represents a shift from what has been his relatively cautious program of 
domestic reform. 
</P>
<P>
For all the apparent daring of many of his foreign policy moves and the 
attention-grabbing candor of his glasnost, or openness, in discussing failings 
at home, Gorbachev has generally been careful to strike a balance between those 
he says want to reform too fast and those who want no reform at all. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that a flurry of ethnic conflicts and, even more 
important, the coal strikes that began earlier this month may have spurred him 
to bolder action. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as five months ago, Gorbachev had resisted proposals to increase 
imports of consumer goods, arguing that it would be better in the long run to 
spend the money on machinery to make consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints on Shortages 
</P>
<P>
Twelve days ago, however, shortages of everything from tea and butter to shoes 
and television sets were high on the list of complaints when Siberian coal 
miners walked off their jobs. The strikes spread and at their peak are believed 
to have shut down as much as a third of the country's daily coal production. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, most Siberian mines were reportedly operating normally after a 
high-level government commission agreed to a 35-point plan including 
significant increases in supplies of consumer goods in the Kuznets region, 
where the strike was centered. 
</P>
<P>
Petrakov, the research institute official, said that such strikes were not 
surprising and that they could spread to other industries. 
</P>
<P>
"The demands presented do not relate to miners alone," he said. "Shortages of 
consumer goods are pervasive, and very difficult working conditions are 
widespread. The only way to avert this spreading of strikes is to finally face 
the real needs of the people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Of Crucial Importance' 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that this cannot be accomplished overnight, but he said it is 
"important for people to feel that an improvement of their situation is under 
way." 
</P>
<P>
"This is of crucial importance to stabilize the social tension in the country," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told the party conference that eliminating shortages of consumer 
goods is an "especially pressing" task. 
</P>
<P>
"All the resources inside the country are being used," he said. "And beyond 
that, opportunities have been found to replenish the market through imports 
totaling about 10 billion rubles." 
</P>
<P>
The coal strikes, which the official news media said were continuing Friday in 
the Ukraine and other areas of the European part of the Soviet Union, were also 
directed at local party and government officials accused by the miners of being 
insensitive to their needs. These bureaucrats are the same people Gorbachev 
blames for frustrating his effort to make the Soviet system more efficient by 
decentralizing it. 
</P>
<P>
Tass reported Friday that the 35-point agreement with Siberian miners says the 
mines "will receive full economic and legal autonomy" and that "the existing 
production amalgamations, with their top-heavy management structure, will be 
replaced by associations or other voluntary forms of organizing coal mining." 
</P>
<P>
Miners also are to get the authority, beginning Aug. 1, "to set their own norms 
of production, pay rates and some other indices," Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said at the party meeting that party bureaucrats are holding back the 
perestroika program rather than leading it. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone still has it in his mind that this worsening situation . . . can be 
controlled through reliance on old methods and approaches, he falls into the 
most profound delusion," he warned. 
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he now sees the primary danger to his program as coming 
from "conservative and dogmatic forces," rather than from those who are 
pressing for more daring reform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leningrad Leaders Removed 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's call for "an infusion of fresh blood" in the party followed by only 
a week a visit to Leningrad, where he presided over the removal of one of the 
country's most powerful party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Former Leningrad party chief Yuri F. Solovyov, who is a non-voting candidate 
member of the Politburo, was defeated, along with most of his fellow city party 
leaders, in last spring's national elections for the new Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Removing Solovyov, a Western diplomat commented, "signaled that (Gorbachev's) 
patience with local officials who don't implement perestroika and solve local 
problems has run out." Now, the diplomat said, it seems likely that he will use 
the disaffection showed by the strikes to purge the party of more dead wood. 
</P>
<P>
Given the extent of the inertia built into the Soviet system, it is not certain 
that a party purge or the import of more consumer goods will do much to help 
the reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
For example, $16 billion in imports equals less than $60 a person in this 
country of 280 million people -- a drop in the bucket compared to what Petrakov 
described as the "catastrophically poor consumer market." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Might Buy Gorbachev Time 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here say, it might buy Gorbachev a little more time to show 
the kind of economic improvement that perestroika must achieve if it is to win 
sustained support from the skeptical public. 
</P>
<P>
In another move to enhance the party's image in society, Gorbachev pushed 
through a pledge at this week's party conference to donate 500 million rubles 
($800 million) out of party membership dues to help the neediest people. 
</P>
<P>
He said the party's donation would cover about 30% of the total required, 
according to Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
"That will be a good step," Gorbachev was quoted as saying. "Do you support 
this move? Good! That's on, then."

SOVIET MARSHAL TELLS U.S. OF FEARS OVER 'STAR WARS' 
</P>

<P>
The highest-ranking Soviet official ever to appear before Congress warned 
Friday that Moscow fears the United States still seeks military superiority 
over the Soviet Union with its so-called "Star Wars" program and its refusal to 
negotiate reductions in naval strength. 
</P>
<P>
In an appearance before the House Armed Services Committee, Soviet Marshal 
Sergei F. Akhromeyev said the Kremlin expects to cut its military spending by 
one-third to one-half before 1995 if current conventional and nuclear arms 
control negotiations are successful. 
</P>
<P>
The slight, 66-year-old officer, now a senior adviser to Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, also said Moscow expects the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization to pursue a policy of "non-interference in the home affairs of 
socialist countries" in Eastern Europe as tensions between NATO and the Warsaw 
Pact are reduced over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Akhromeyev spoke to the committee at the invitation of Chairman Les Aspin 
(D-Wis.). Lawmakers characterized the appearance by the retired Soviet chief of 
staff as unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing almost scholarly despite his beribboned uniform, Akhromeyev was at 
times direct, at times humorous during his long session before the committee. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, noting that the United States spends 11 times as much as the 
Soviet Union on military pay, Akhromeyev remarked that U.S. admirals and 
generals get higher salaries than their Soviet counterparts. Rep. G. V. (Sonny) 
Montgomery (D-Miss.) asked good-naturedly if he was suggesting a cut in pay for 
the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"God forbid!" the Russian replied. "I don't want to fight with them (the 
American officers). I just started becoming friends with them." 
</P>
<P>
Another congressman, Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), noted that Akhromeyev was 
precise in divulging existing quantities of some types of Soviet weapons, but 
in the case of sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs), he referred only to 
"certain numbers" of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't tell us how many SLCMs you have," the Russian responded with a 
smile, "so in this case, that's how I'll base my answer. . . . (But) we're 
prepared to exchange that information." 
</P>
<P>
In his formal presentation, Akhromeyev said the Soviet Union is "convinced that 
political means to achieve security will predominate in the 1990s, while the 
role of military means must decrease. However, the war danger has not gone 
away." 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you in all candor," he continued, "that we see the reason for war 
danger in the position-of-strength policy pursued by the U.S. and NATO." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, he said, if a so-called "Star Wars" anti-missile system is 
created, the United States would achieve a major military advantage by having a 
defensive space-based system that the Soviets would not possess. A new arms 
race in space would result from implementation of the Strategic Defense 
Initiative, he predicted, and the proposed strategic arms treaty to cut 
offensive weapons by 50% "would become inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, "a major prerequisite for further improvement in Soviet-American 
relations" is a series of talks to reduce naval forces and limit military 
activities at sea, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Position of Strength' 
</P>
<P>
"We are greatly concerned" at U.S. reluctance to begin such talks, he said, 
because it suggests that the United States, after an agreement on cutting 
ground forces in Europe, could "then build up its naval forces without any 
constraints, especially its carrier battle groups, thus gaining military 
superiority in order to dictate its will to the U.S.S.R. from the position of 
strength." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Akhromeyev said, the Soviets have adopted a military doctrine of 
"defensive sufficiency, which means the minimum resources possessed by a state 
or an alliance needed to repulse aggression." 
</P>
<P>
The results have included reduced military budgets and weapons production, he 
said. Soviet military spending this year will total 77.3 billion rubles (about 
$125 billion at the official exchange rate), he said. Cuts of 30 billion rubles 
($48 billion) will be realized over a three-year period ending in 1990, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Weapons production will be down an average of 19.5% by the end of 1990, he 
said, with some systems cut more than others. Production of new tanks, for 
example, will be reduced more than 40%. Asked if the Soviet Union produced 
4,000 tanks a year, Akhromeyev said the correct figure is 1,700. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Differing Estimates of Strength 
</P>
<P>
Aspin questioned Akhromeyev at length on the differing estimates of Soviet 
military spending. U.S. intelligence officials estimate that the Soviets spend 
between 130 billion and 160 billion rubles, roughly twice as much as the 
official Soviet budget claims. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin noted, and Akhromeyev agreed, that the U.S. estimate includes many 
categories excluded by the Soviets, such as the costs of KGB security police 
who guard the borders, civilian workers of the Defense Ministry and military 
construction groups who are often engaged in non-military work. 
</P>
<P>
But even with such factors are taken into account, the Soviet budget should be 
about 100 billion rubles, rather than 77 billion, Aspin said. The two men then 
agreed that the lack of a realistic pricing system in the Soviet Union, as well 
as the artificially low values now placed on raw materials there, probably 
account for much of the disparity.

HIGH-LEVEL U.S. ENVOY SUSPECTED AS SOVIET SPY 
</P>

A 30-year State Department veteran who recently served as the No. 2 official at 
the U.S. Embassy in Vienna and now heads a division dealing with European 
affairs is suspected of spying for the Soviet Union, federal officials 
confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The official is Felix S. Bloch, who sources said was videotaped giving a 
briefcase of materials to a Soviet agent. A State Department spokesman 
confirmed Friday night that Bloch has been placed on administrative leave and 
is the subject of an FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Illegal Activities' 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security is cooperating with an 
FBI inquiry into reports of illegal activities involving (Bloch) and agents of 
a foreign intelligence service," said the spokesman, Richard Boucher. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the case involves a potentially serious breach of highly 
sensitive information that could damage U.S. national security interests. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Vienna handled all contacts with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization until the United States opened direct talks with the PLO in 
Tunisia, and the contacts were directed by Bloch, a source familiar with U.S. 
intelligence said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, 54, currently serves in Washington as director of the Office of Regional 
Political-Economic Affairs in the State Department's Bureau of European and 
Canadian Affairs, the bureau that helps set American policy toward Western 
Europe, Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch's own unit is in charge of U.S. policy towards the European Community. 
But one State Department official said Friday night that as an office director, 
Bloch also would have had access to materials on State Department deliberations 
on high-technology items that the United States and its European allies would 
not allow to be sold to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
While the second-ranking official in Vienna, Bloch had access to secret 
communications sent to and from the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Access to Top Secrets 
</P>
<P>
"He had access to top-secret, compartmentalized information and was at a level 
where it all comes together to be fed into the decision-making process," one 
federal official said. 
</P>
<P>
Another official said Bloch was not directly involved in Soviet policy or in 
arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch has not been arrested, and a source familiar with the investigation said 
that much of what happens in the investigation depends on any explanation he 
may give to FBI agents. "He has some tall explaining to do" about the incident 
in which he was allegedly videotaped giving a briefcase to a Soviet official, 
the source said. 
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the FBI has been interviewing Bloch's friends and 
associates for more than a week. News of the investigation was first made 
public Friday night by ABC News. 
</P>
<P>
Until about two years ago, Bloch served as deputy chief of mission, the 
second-ranking official, at the U.S. Embassy in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch was the senior Foreign Service officer in the U.S. Embassy, serving under 
two ambassadors who were political appointees of the Reagan Administration and 
had little previous experience in foreign policy. The first was Helene A. von 
Damm, who went to Vienna after serving as President Reagan's secretary and 
administrative assistant. The second was businessman Ronald Lauder. 
</P>
<P>
"Under a politically appointed ambassador, it's the DCM (deputy chief of 
mission) who runs the show and knows what's happening," a senior American 
intelligence analyst observed. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch fell under suspicion two years ago while serving at the U.S. Embassy in 
Austria because superiors believed that he maintained unusually close ties with 
the Austrian government, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
He was eventually asked to leave that post by then-Ambassador Lauder, according 
to sources close to Lauder. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known when Bloch is alleged to have handed over the briefcase to a 
Soviet agent in Vienna or for how long he is suspected of engaging in spying 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Born in Austria 
</P>
<P>
According to a biographical register once published by the State Department, 
Bloch was born in Austria in 1935, graduated from the University of 
Pennsylvania and joined the department in October, 1958, as an intelligence 
research specialist. 
</P>
<P>
In his early career, he served overseas as a commercial officer in Duesseldorf, 
West Berlin and Caracas. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher, the department spokesman, said Friday night that Bloch's State 
Department pass "has been withdrawn pending resolution of this matter" -- 
meaning that he will not be entitled to enter the building. He would not say 
when this action was taken or when Bloch was placed on administrative leave. 
</P>
<P>
Preston Pitts, a neighbor of Bloch in downtown Washington, said Friday night 
that agents have been staking out Bloch's home for about three weeks. "There 
were six or seven cars with two people in each car. The cars stayed there every 
day in the same position," Pitts said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitts said he was sure Bloch knew he was being watched. "I saw him walk his dog 
two weeks ago, and all the cars followed him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In major investigations where the FBI is attempting to obtain information from 
the suspect himself, it routinely employs obvious surveillance as a means of 
pressuring the suspect to cooperate, at least to the extent of offering an 
explanation for his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the investigation said the videotape of Bloch in Vienna was 
not made by the FBI but by another investigative agency, which he would not 
identify. The source would not say whether the CIA has participated in the 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
Cases of suspected spying by State Department diplomats are rare, and no 
high-level officials have been implicated publicly in many years. In the most 
celebrated espionage case touching the department, Alger Hiss, a 10-year 
veteran official, was convicted of perjury in 1950 in connection with the 
passing of department documents to the Soviets in the late 1930s.

With prospects for a military victory by Afghan resistance groups beginning to 
fade, the United States announced Friday that it will conduct a new round of 
talks on Afghanistan with the Soviet Union to explore the chances for a 
political settlement there. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, to begin in Stockholm on July 31, will be the first between U.S. and 
Soviet experts on Afghanistan since the Bush Administration took office and the 
Soviet Union completed its withdrawal of troops from the country early this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
One State Department official said the United States hopes "to once again weigh 
in with the Soviets on how to get the (Soviet-backed regime in Kabul) out of 
control." 
</P>
<P>
"A political solution would be great," this official said. "However, the 
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (Kabul's Communist regime) is not in 
on the deal. A resolution is going to have to be one without a PDPA presence." 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that during the talks, the U.S. 
delegation also expects to talk with the Soviet Union about developments in 
Iran. The U.S. delegation will be headed by John Kelly, the assistant secretary 
of state for Near East and South Asian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini last month, Hashemi 
Rafsanjani, the powerful leader of the Iranian Parliament, visited Moscow and 
concluded a series of agreements upgrading economic cooperation between the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ready to Discuss Iran 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets have indicated to us that they'd be prepared to answer questions 
about Iran," one U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Soviet Union finished pulling its troops out of Afghanistan on Feb. 
15, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent a personal message to President 
Bush, urging the United States to help in bringing about a peaceful settlement 
of the conflict between the government in Kabul and the anti-Communist Afghan 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials also urged that the United States stop supplying arms to the 
rebels. But Bush turned down the Soviet overtures, saying that -- because the 
Afghan government possessed a huge stockpile of arms left behind by the Soviet 
troops -- it would "not be fair" for the United States to cut off supplies to 
the Afghan resistance. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, many U.S. officials suggested that the Afghan resistance groups 
were in a strong position to win a military victory over the Kabul government. 
But over the last five months, the rebels have failed in repeated efforts to 
capture the strategic eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, which lies along the 
main road from Kabul to the border with Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials have said that the unexpectedly weak performance by the 
Afghan resistance groups on the battlefield is at least partly the result of a 
huge increase in arms shipments from the Soviet Union to the Afghan government. 
</P>
<P>
But a second factor has been the divisions among the resistance groups. On July 
9, as many as 30 military leaders -- including seven commanders -- of one rebel 
group were ambushed and killed in northern Afghanistan in an attack blamed on a 
rival guerrilla group. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Friday whether the United States is now reevaluating its policy on 
Afghanistan to take account of the weakening position of the resistance groups, 
one State Department official replied, "There's always a reevaluation of Afghan 
policy."

2,000 ARRESTED, 450 REPORTED SLAIN IN WEEK OF DISTURBANCES IN SOMALIA

A human rights group said Friday that security forces in Somalia arrested about 
2,000 people after religious disturbances last week and killed more than 300, 
bringing the week's death toll to 450, including 46 people taken to a beach and 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Africa Watch, in a report based on interviews with residents of 
the Somali capital of Mogadishu, said 90 civilians and 20 soldiers died in 
fighting outside the city's mosques a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Random firing of automatic weapons from armored personnel carriers into crowded 
residential buildings, combined with arrests and executions in following days, 
brought the estimated toll to 450. More than 1,000 people were wounded, the 
independent rights group said in the report written in London and made public 
in Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
The army mounted house-to-house searches two days after the religious 
disturbances, whose cause remains obscure, the report said. Most of those 
arrested that night were taken to prisons and detention camps, but 46 were 
taken to the Jezira beach south of the capital and executed, it said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the reports of 
summary executions are "credible." 
</P>
<P>
"We have raised our concerns with the government of Somalia," Boucher said.

A 39-year-old Briton caught seven years ago trying to smuggle heroin out of the 
country in his boots and underwear was hanged at dawn Friday, his last plea for 
help to Queen Elizabeth II unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gregory, of Surrey in southern England, walked out of his grim cell at 
Kajang Prison to the gallows at 6 a.m. local time, leaving behind a photograph 
of his 7-year-old daughter he had kept with him constantly in his final days. 
</P>
<P>
"The sentence was carried out," a prison official said curtly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory, in a last-ditch attempt to save his life, had sent a message to Queen 
Elizabeth asking her to intervene on his behalf. A spokesman at Buckingham 
Palace said she did not. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's Pleas Ignored 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher earlier made two appeals to Malaysian 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed but was unable to persuade the Malay 
government to alter the death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"The British government had hoped that the representations made at all levels 
to the Malaysian authorities making a plea for commutation of the death 
sentence on humanitarian grounds would succeed," said a statement from the 
British High Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed that they have not and offer our sympathies" to Gregory's 
family, it said. 
</P>
<P>
After the hanging, Gregory's body was taken from the prison to a nearby 
hospital, and the British High Commission completed arrangements for it to be

RULING PARTY'S CREDIBILITY ERODES IN DISPUTE OVER MEXICO STATE ELECTION 
</P>

<P>
The credibility that the Institutional Revolutionary Party gained earlier this 
month after conceding its first governor's race in 60 years is rapidly eroding 
with opposition charges that the official party stole a state legislature 
election in Michoacan. 
</P>
<P>
Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, whose Democratic Revolutionary Party claims 
to have won a majority of the legislative seats, and the right-wing National 
Action Party have called for an independent tribunal to review the disputed 
results of the Michoacan election. 
</P>
<P>
However, the National Action Party said it also distrusts Cardenas' claim to 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confusion Cited 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much confusion and scarcity of trustworthy figures that perhaps 
the only conclusion that can be drawn in Michoacan is that there were no 
legitimate elections," National Action President Luis H. Alvarez said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The Michoacan State Electoral Commission has declared that the PRI, as the 
ruling party is called, won 12 of the 18 direct election seats. The commission 
is dominated by the official party. 
</P>
<P>
National PRI spokesmen on Friday rejected the proposed independent tribunal as 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"To proceed in that way would be to disavow the respectability of the electoral 
process," said Dionisio Perez Jacome, a member of the PRI executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Mexico's electoral process has been fighting for respectability for years. 
The ruling party has been accused of stealing several local elections, 
including the mayorship of Mexicali in 1983 and the governorship of Chihuahua 
state in 1986. The opposition charges that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
did not really win last year's federal election. 
</P>
<P>
That history of doubt is why the PRI's loss in Baja California was seen as a 
major boon to its credibility. A few days after the vote, PRI President Luis 
Donaldo Colosio conceded his party's defeat to National Action candidate 
Ernesto Ruffo Appel. 
</P>
<P>
Colosio's announcement apparently headed off efforts by state PRI officials to 
usurp the election. Colosio said that, although painful for the PRI, the loss 
proved Salinas' commitment to democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
But as the controversy over Michoacan has grown, political analysts have begun 
to talk of the president's "selective democracy" in favor of the conservative 
party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shadow of Baja' 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Michoacan is the shadow of Baja California," said Federico Reyes 
Heroles, a political analyst and member of the PRI's critical current faction. 
</P>
<P>
"While in the case of Baja California the government managed to show that 
political will could overcome fraud, in Michoacan it did not. For this to have 
been a true show of democracy, there would have to have been fair play. It is 
evident that there weren't just irregularities in Michoacan, but true electoral 
crimes," Reyes Heroles said. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted a PRI-National Action alliance on future economic policy and a new 
federal electoral law. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference this week, Cardenas charged the government and ruling 
party with having annulled ballot boxes with a majority for his party, altered 
the results of other ballot boxes in favor of the PRI and fabricated results 
for ballot boxes that were never installed on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
For example, charged Amalia Garcia, a federal deputy from Cardenas' party, 
polling station 10-A was never installed in the village of El Salto and yet the 
final results gave the PRI 98 votes there. Federal Deputy Leonel Godoy said 
official results gave the PRI 636 votes in polling station 86 in Paracuaro, 
although there were only 193 legally registered voters there. 
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates not selective democracy, but that he who makes electoral 
decisions uses his personal criteria on which to accept or reject the defeat of 
his party. It is a selective criteria," Cardenas said. 
</P>
<P>
On Election Day, each party was to receive a carbon copy of the official tally 
that is placed into each ballot box for the district-wide count. Cardenas 
presented his copies of tallies from most of the ballot boxes and called for 
the PRI to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
PRI official Perez Jacome rejected the call and said the carbon copies are easy 
to falsify. While Cardenas' documents may have the "appearance of truth," he 
said, they amounted to a "strategy of trickery" by the Democratic Revolutionary 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraud Charges Denied 
</P>
<P>
Perez Jacome and other PRI officials denied the charges of fraud and said 
Cardenas supporters were the ones who stole ballot boxes and used violence 
against PRI voters. They said the commission also annulled ballot boxes where 
the PRI claimed a majority. 
</P>
<P>
But while the PRI is clearly on the defensive in Michoacan, so is Cardenas 
struggling to defend his fledgling party. Cardenas broke away from the PRI last 
year to run against Salinas with a coalition of four parties and won an 
unprecedented 31% of the official vote count. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas has since broken with the coalition to form the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party, known by its initials PRD, and the leader acknowledges 
that he needs an electoral victory to keep his momentum. Cardenas defended 
supporters who have blocked federal highways in Michoacan to protest the 
reputed fraud but said he will work though the legal system to try to prove his 
party's victory. He has filed criminal charges against Michoacan officials for 
allegedly falsifying election documents. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Revolutionary Party is formed by ordinary people," said Reyes 
Heroles. "What hope do they have in Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and the PRD if they 
can't protect the vote in their home state? This could strangle the PRD."

CHINA CUTS UNIVERSITY ROLLS BY 30,000 IN BID TO CURB DISSENT

China's government, further clamping down on intellectuals and education after 
crushing the student-led pro-democracy movement, said Friday that 30,000 fewer 
students will enter universities this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese sources said Beijing University, a traditional hotbed for political 
dissent and a center of the recent movement, was singled out in the cutback. 
First-year enrollment will be slashed to 800 from 2,000, and no new graduate 
students will be admitted, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Government television quoted a State Education Commission spokesman as saying 
the overall number of students entering universities this fall would be reduced 
to 610,000 from 640,000. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching and living conditions could not be kept up and some graduating 
students have been unable to find or hold down jobs, the education commission 
was quoted as saying in explanation. 
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that some academic programs have strayed from the 
Communist Party line. 
</P>
<P>
"Some subjects, for instance the humanities, are not well defined," the 
spokesman said. "They must be reorganized to serve the needs of socialist 
construction." 
</P>
<P>
Political education had become a weak link and students of all disciplines 
"were imbued with bourgeois ideas of every description," the spokesman added. 
"Political terms such as democracy, freedom and human rights are much in vogue 
among students." 
</P>
<P>
Universities were centers for the democracy movement that spread across China 
in April and May. The movement was crushed June 3 when the army fired on 
unarmed crowds in Beijing, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands. 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, 18 journalists of the pro-China newspaper Wen Wei Po resigned 
Friday in support of the newspaper's director, Lee Tze-chung, who was sacked 
for condemning the crackdown. Under Lee's direction, the Hong Kong paper had 
published a number of articles describing the military attack on student-led 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 3,000 people are confirmed to have been detained and at least 29 
executed for their roles in the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
China's most prominent dissident, Fang Lizhi, was dismissed as vice chairman 
and council member of the Natural Dialectics Research Society, an independent 
scientific research organization, the Beijing Daily reported. 
</P>
<P>
Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, have been sheltered at the U.S. Embassy since 
June 7 despite China's demands they be handed over to face charges of 
"counterrevolutionary" crimes.

SOVIET WARSHIPS IN PORT FOR A TASTE OF U.S. HOSPITALITY

With the American flag snapping atop its mainmast, the guided-missile cruiser 
Marshal Ustinov, flanked by two smaller Soviet warships, sailed Friday into the 
home port of the Navy's Atlantic Fleet on a good-will mission that will give 
1,000 Soviet sailors a five-day taste of Virginia hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
"Peace has got to start somewhere," said Todd Oiesen, a 19-year-old fireman 
aboard the vessel Harry E. Yarnell, who swapped a white seaman's cap and a can 
of Coca-Cola for two colorful pins from a young Soviet sailor. 
</P>
<P>
"This visit is part of making that peace," Oiesen added. "I'm definitely proud 
to have them here." 
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Marshal Ustinov, the destroyer Otlichny and the oiler Genrikh 
Gasanov marks the first time in 14 years -- and only the second time since 
World War II -- that Soviet warships have visited the United States. In 1975, 
two guided-missile destroyers spent six days in Boston while two U.S. Navy 
vessels sailed to the Soviet port of Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
The three Soviet ships sailed into a U.S. naval nerve center at a time of great 
change in Soviet society, giving the mission more significance than the earlier 
visit, U.S. and Soviet officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Yuli Dubinin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, who was on hand to 
welcome his countrymen, said the visit "underscores the great, deep changes in 
Soviet-American relations. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a big event . . . a clear, tangible manifestation of the new spirit, the 
new thinking" in relations between the two superpowers, Dubinin said. 
</P>
<P>
From the mightiest officer swathed in gold braid to the lowliest cadet in a 
tasseled cap, the Soviet seamen seemed delighted with their new roles as 
ambassadors of friendship -- and just as pleased to make port after a 22-day 
sail from their home base in the northern reaches of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Seas and oceans do not only separate continents, they also unite peoples 
living on these continents," said Vice Admiral Igor V. Kasatonov, the first 
deputy commander in chief of the Soviet Northern Fleet, who oversaw the voyage. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand for converting the seas and oceans of the Earth into the zone of 
cooperation, of mutual assistance and friendly contacts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kasatonov walked down the Marshal Ustinov's gangplank and was escorted by his 
American hosts to a small table bearing a loaf of freshly baked bread and a 
dish of salt, traditional Russian tokens of hospitality. Bowing formally, 
Kasatonov took a bite of bread and dipped it in the salt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're lucky to come here," said Roman Tachenko, a 21-year-old seaman 
from a suburb of Odessa. "They are two great countries," he said through an 
interpreter. "We must cooperate and solve all great questions together." 
</P>
<P>
Tachenko and his comrades will get to experience everyday life in this city -- 
scheduled lunches at McDonald's and Domino's Pizza; trips to a shopping mall, a 
supermarket and a hardware store, and a minor league baseball game one night. 
There are special events as well -- daily excursions to the Busch Gardens theme 
park near Williamsburg and a pig roast tonight, complete with an outdoor 
concert and fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal for the Navy and the city has been to put on a show," said Lt. Cmdr. 
John W. Lloyd, a Navy spokesman. "We want to look our best." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, for their part, are offering public tours of two of their ships 
this weekend, although cameras will be prohibited on board. A Soviet 
song-and-dance troupe will perform during the visit, backed up by the 20-piece 
Soviet Navy band that played Sousa selections at dockside Friday.

WALLACH DENIES ATTEMPTING TO IMPRESS CLIENTS 
</P>

<P>
E. Robert Wallach, the San Francisco lawyer-lobbyist who had a close 
relationship with former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III, took umbrage Friday when a 
prosecutor suggested that he was an inveterate name-dropper. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not drop names," Wallach said flatly to Assistant U.S. Atty. Baruch 
Weiss, who is trying him with two associates on racketeering and 
influence-peddling charges in U.S. District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
But, in one of the lighter moments of his five days on the witness stand, 
Wallach's scowl dissolved into a sheepish grin when Weiss read him a memorandum 
in which Wallach had boasted about name-dropping. 
</P>
<P>
In an Aug. 8, 1985, memo to Swiss businessman Bruce Rappaport on a meeting with 
U.S. Export-Import Bank President William Draper, Wallach reported: "I dropped 
every major political name involved, understanding the effect it would have on 
him and his staff." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jury Also Smiles 
</P>
<P>
Wallach turned with a broad grin toward members of the jury, who also had 
smiles on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach's reference to political names apparently included Meese and 
then-National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane, to whom Meese had 
introduced him. Wallach has testified that besides approaching Meese -- a 
longtime friend -- about helping scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., a Bronx-based 
defense contractor, he also contacted Meese and McFarlane in 1985 about an 
ill-fated Middle East pipeline project that was unrelated to Wedtech. 
</P>
<P>
The pipeline venture that Wallach and Rappaport were promoting eventually was 
backed by the Export-Import Bank but collapsed when Iraq, the host country, 
said it was dissatisfied with assurances from Israel that it would not sabotage 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach, who was on the witness stand all week and will return to it Monday, 
has sought to downplay his contacts with Meese in attempting to gain government 
contracts for now-defunct Wedtech. But prosecutors have introduced dozens of 
memos written by Wallach in which he bragged about his contacts at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In one such memo dated March 2, 1984, Wallach told Wedtech executives that they 
and Meese were "my two major East Coast clients." He was referring to his 
representation of Meese at stormy Senate hearings that year on Meese's 
nomination to be attorney general. Meese, a longtime confidant of former 
President Ronald Reagan, had been White House counselor. 
</P>
<P>
The memos show that Wallach advised Wedtech officials to do some gentle 
name-dropping when they spoke with a Navy program manager in Washington, Capt. 
David de Vicq, about obtaining a prospective multimillion-dollar pontoon 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"He should be aware of Wedtech's general ally structure," Wallach wrote about 
De Vicq. "He doesn't have to know it in detail. The fact that we have it, and 
his awareness of it, ought to be gently indicated." 
</P>
<P>
Wallach and his co-defendants, former Wedtech consultants W. Franklyn Chinn of 
San Francisco and R. Kent London of Honolulu, are accused of conspiring to 
obtain nearly $2 million from the struggling company under false pretenses. 
Wallach illegally extracted at least $525,000 himself on a promise to use his 
influence with Meese, concealing from stockholders the purpose of these 
payments with false letters and invoices, the federal grand jury that indicted 
him has charged.

CRASH SURVIVOR TAKES TO AIR AGAIN -- IN HER LUCKY SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before she got on her flight for Chicago Friday afternoon, Katy Bressieux 
decided it might be a good idea to stop in the bar at the Omaha airport -- just 
to take the edge off with a nice glass of wine. 
</P>
<P>
Once on board, she checked out the emergency exits, removed the safety 
information card from the seat pocket in front of her and actually read it, 
then stared obediently as the flight attendants ran through the pre-takeoff 
safety briefing that most passengers routinely ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Despite appearances, Bressieux, a 35-year-old development consultant, is no 
run-of-the-mill, white-knuckled flier. She is one of the survivors of 
Wednesday's deadly crash of a crippled United Airlines DC-10 jetliner in Sioux 
City, Iowa. And United Flight 146, a Boeing 727 bound from Omaha to Chicago, 
was her first experience in the air since that ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
After the crash, Bressieux's husband, Jean Pierre, flew to Iowa from their home 
in Boulder, Colo., to be at her side. Although she was far from panicked, Jean 
Pierre said it took some coaxing to get his wife on the plane to Chicago, where 
her parents were anxiously awaiting her arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, she didn't want to, but then I said 'to get over this you need to do 
it right away or you'll never get over it,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suffered Scratch on Head 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Friday's flight went much smoother for Bressieux than the previous 
one, which ended with her strapped upside down in her seat after the DC-10's 
fuselage rolled over and broke apart on impact. Her only injury was a scratch 
on the head. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not exactly an average flight, either. The airline ferried the 
couple by bus from Sioux City to Omaha. In an eerie coincidence, Bressieux was 
assigned seat 17B when she checked in at the counter, the same seat she had 
occupied on Wednesday's ill-fated flight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," she told the ticket agent. "That's the seat I was on, and I 
survived it. It's a good seat for me." 
</P>
<P>
On board, she was the center of attention. Other passengers came up to shake 
her hand, and flight attendants stopped by to chat and deliver bottles of 
complimentary wine. Reading her first newspaper accounts of the incident, she 
marveled at the skill of Capt. Alfred C. Haynes, the pilot who kept the plane 
aloft for 41 minutes after an engine blew up and his hydraulic systems failed. 
</P>
<P>
"We got to drink to this guy, Al Haynes, he's great," Bressieux said, clinking 
her glass against her husband's. 
</P>
<P>
Despite brief lapses, Bressieux said, she was surprised at how cool and 
unemotional she remained both before and after the crash. When told to brace 
herself for the worst, Bressieux calmly removed some pearls and keepsakes from 
her purse and put them in her pocket so she wouldn't lose them. 
</P>
<P>
"My mental state through the whole experience has been absolutely clear," she 
said. "I was never anxious. I was very aware of everything that was going on. I 
could see that a lot of people didn't make it, I saw blood, but it wasn't 
computing inside. That's why I think I may still be in shock." 
</P>
<P>
Not until hours after the crash, when she tried to sleep, did the impact of the 
horror she escaped sink in. "I laid down for a couple of hours and I started to 
have all kinds of flashes, memories, and I got terrified of the idea of going 
on a plane again," she recalled. "But I don't feel that way now. I don't feel 
anything in particular. I'm feeling happy. I'm feeling good." 
</P>
<P>
Any preflight jitters she may have had seemed to melt away en route as 
Bressieux talked almost non-stop on her way to Chicago. She hardly seemed to 
notice when the plane touched down smoothly on the runway and taxied to the 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike on Wednesday, the only mark that Bressieux would carry away from the 
airport was a red smear of lipstick on her cheek from her mother's kiss.

Each side blamed the other Friday for a clash between hundreds of supporters of 
suspended Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald and tribal police officers that left 
two people dead and nine injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police "randomly opened fire on Navajo civilians" during a protest late 
Thursday at the tribal government complex, MacDonald said in a statement. He 
said he was "shocked, appalled and angered" at the police actions. 
</P>
<P>
Police and tribal officials said officers opened fire in self-defense after 
being attacked by the crowd, which numbered more than 300. MacDonald incited 
supporters and was indirectly responsible, tribal spokesman Duane Beyal said. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald was placed on administrative leave by the governing council of the 
nation's largest Indian tribe after allegations at U.S. Senate hearings in 
January that he accepted bribes and kickbacks. He has denied any wrongdoing, 
and followers believe he was deposed illegally, although tribal courts have 
upheld the move. 
</P>
<P>
There were no further signs of unrest Friday, although about 50 people were 
camped just across the New Mexico line. Large stones and shards of glass 
littered the road running through the tribal government complex. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the demonstration got out of hand when the crowd attacked Navajo 
police Lt. Daniel Hawkins, who led a May 24 sweep of the tribe's administration 
building during which MacDonald appointees and supporters were evicted from 
offices they had refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"They took his Mace, his revolver, handcuffed him, kicked him a few times and 
left him on the ground," Beyal said. The tribal spokesman said the crowd then 
went after a second officer, taking his revolver and beating and handcuffing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
An "elderly gentleman" took Hawkins' gun and shot Sgt. Daniel Lee in the thigh, 
Beyal said. According to varying accounts, Lee or other officers then shot the 
man, identified by MacDonald as James Dickson, 57, and by others as Jimmy 
Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said the other man killed was Arnold Lee Begay, 27. Begay was shot by 
an unidentified officer who saw him about to hit another officer from behind 
with a club, Beyal said.

An Amtrak train carrying survivors of the crash of a United Airlines jetliner 
in Sioux City, Iowa, Friday struck and killed a 6-year-old boy who was crossing 
the tracks in Cheriton, Iowa, Amtrak officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Zephyr hit Jason Lee Howie as the boy walked his bicycle across 
the railroad tracks, an Amtrak spokesman said. The train, which picked up 
survivors from Wednesday's crash of Flight 232 in Omaha, arrived at Chicago's 
Union Station late Friday.

SEAT DESIGN CITED IN SURVIVAL OF MANY IN DC-10 CRASH 
</P>

<P>
While blind luck and fortunate circumstances helped more than 180 passengers 
survive the fiery DC-10 crash in Iowa, firmly anchored seats were cited Friday 
as an important factor in keeping the death toll lower than initially feared. 
</P>
<P>
A number of experts have said they were astonished at the relatively low death 
toll in the crash of United Airlines Flight 232, bound from Denver to Chicago 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Experts said that many of the survivors lived because their seats remained 
fastened to the aircraft floor, sparing them from potentially fatal injuries as 
the jetliner crashed into the ground, burst into flames and separated into 
three sections. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers injured or killed were thrown out of the airplane and 
hurled down the runway, still strapped into their seats, according to David J. 
Greco, emergency medical director of Marian Health Care Center in Sioux City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Injuries 
</P>
<P>
"They looked as if they had been rolling for up to half a mile at high speeds," 
Greco said, noting that many suffered massive head, arm and leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed a rule -- which must be 
approved by the secretary of transportation -- that would require airlines to 
install seats with even greater crash resistance by June, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"Stronger seats are less likely to break out of the seat tracks. If the seats 
break out, it's rather devastating," said Henri Branting, manager of the FAA's 
technical analysis branch. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the NTSB (National Transportation 
Safety Board) in their final report (on Wednesday's crash) urges the FAA to 
expedite the rule," said Nancy Gilmer, coordinator of air safety and health 
research for the American Assn. of Flight Attendants. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, aircraft seats are designed to withstand up to nine G-forces, or 
nine times the force of gravity. The proposed rule would order installation of 
seats capable of withstanding 16 G-forces, said Gilmer, who noted that most 
automobile seats can withstand up to 20 G-forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Impact 
</P>
<P>
Stronger seats can absorb more impact in a crash, Gilmer said, and they are 
less likely to separate from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
United Airlines spokesman Herb Gardner in Chicago said that he could not 
discuss the type of seats installed in the DC-10 that crashed Wednesday because 
the company has turned all maintenance records over to the NTSB. "I'm certain 
the seats comply with current FAA standards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The DC-10 came down in a cornfield yards short of a runway at Sioux City after 
the pilot reported that he had lost all control. The disaster apparently was 
caused by an explosion in the plane's tail engine and the subsequent failure of 
its hydraulic systems. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into what experts called a "controlled collision" with the runway, the 
plane pitched to the right and scraped its right wing. It cartwheeled, breaking 
into pieces as it rolled. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the survivors were seated in Rows 9 to 19 in a section of the plane 
that landed upside down after the crash. They were able to unbuckle their seat 
belts and walk away from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
A number of unusual circumstances enabled such a large number of people to 
survive, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the aircraft was in a landing position, "it hit in a flat manner," said 
Allan Mears of the Flight Safety Foundation. "The clipped wing caused it to 
roll, and the impact forces were not tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
The DC-10 broke into three sections: the cockpit, the main body and the tail 
end of the plane. "Those (seated) away from the immediate break points probably 
had a good chance of surviving," said Wayne Williams of the National 
Transportation Safety Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But experts said that there is no predictably safe place to sit on an airplane 
since the impact of every crash differs. "There are too many variables in an 
accident," said Michael Benson, spokesman for the National Transportation 
Safety Board here. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the wings increase the strength of the middle section of a plane, 
that area is surrounded by fuel tanks. Flight 232, which had flown for more 
than two hours before it crashed, may have used most of its fuel, lessening the 
fires that broke out when it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
"Fire, smoke and toxic fumes really kill most people in these crashes, rather 
than the crash itself," said Edmund J. Cantilli, executive director of the 
Institute for Safety in Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Fire-resistant seat cushions, required in all airplanes under a 1988 FAA rule, 
probably slowed the spread of the fire in the cabin. In the past, seat cushions 
made of polyurethane foam spread fire quickly, emitting toxic gases in the 
process.

The United Mine Workers presented a proposal Friday to resolve its 3 
1/2-month-old strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc., but no agreement was 
reached and the two sides decided to recess. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears there is nothing new in it," Pittston spokeswoman Susan Copeland 
said. The company will respond to the proposal next week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Each side said the other asked for a recess until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really frustrating," said Bruce Bratten, administrative assistant to UMW 
vice president Cecil Roberts. "We came in here and stated we were willing to 
stay and continue this on. It's hard to come to an agreement when you can't get 
someone to sit at a table across from you." 
</P>
<P>
A four-person negotiating team from the union and Pittston Vice President Joe 
Farrell spent the day meeting in separate rooms and federal mediators shuttled 
proposals back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
The union presented two proposals, Bratten said. One was a formal request that 
the two sides meet face to face. The other proposal would address Pittston's 
need for miners to work Sundays if Pittston would consider the miners' need for 
job security, Bratten said.

Cuban President Fidel Castro has said communism is not in decline and 
scathingly attacked capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Capitalism "is a society of beasts, a zoo where the lions run free and the 
powerful devour the weak," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the hourlong speech, televised on Thursday night and published in Friday's 
official newspaper Granma, Castro spoke in glowing terms of Cuba's free medical 
care, educational system, child care centers and schools for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"Which of those dehumanized (capitalist) cities have those services?" he asked. 
"Imperialism thinks socialism is in decline, but what is declining is 
imperialism and captitalism."

AIR FORCE OFFICIALS TO FIGHT START PACT IF B-2 IS KILLED 
</P>

The nation's highest-ranking nuclear field commander warned lawmakers Friday 
that he and other senior Air Force officials would oppose the Administration's 
stance in the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks if Congress kills the stealth 
bomber program. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you right now, I could not support a START agreement" without 
assurances that the Air Force would get the go-ahead to build the B-2 stealth 
bomber, Gen. John T. Chain Jr., chief of the Strategic Air Command, told the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I would come and testify before your committee against a START agreement," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing Chain's remarks, Gen. Larry D. Welch, Air Force chief of staff, told 
the lawmakers that it is "largely inconceivable that we could continue with 
current negotiating positions without the B-2. In my view, we would simply have 
to go back to the drawing board and virtually start over in crafting some new 
negotiating position." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cuts in Both Chambers 
</P>
<P>
The generals' remarks were part of a push by the Air Force to preserve funding 
for the bomber, which has suffered cuts in the House and Senate. A showdown on 
the program is expected to come next week, when both chambers consider their 
defense bills. 
</P>
<P>
Welch's and Chain's cautions drew an angry response from Sen. Timothy E. Wirth 
(D-Colo.), who called the warnings "a squeeze play," and "a very dangerous 
political game." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's debate the B-2 on its merits," Wirth said in a statement issued late 
Friday. "Pressuring Congress to fund a weapon by threatening to derail START is 
not a very good way for the President to begin negotiations with Congress over 
defense budgets and arms control." 
</P>
<P>
The House bill would cut $800 million from the Pentagon's $4.8-billion request 
for the bomber. The Senate bill proposes to trim $300 million from the program. 
The Senate Armed Services Committee's draft bill also would bar the use of any 
B-2 funds in 1990 before the first series of flight tests is completed. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush met Thursday and Friday with lawmakers, including several 
Republican skeptics, to rally support for the program. White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the President would continue the effort next 
week by placing calls to other lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional supporters of the program Friday also called B-2 test pilots 
Bruce Hinds and Col. Richard Couch to witness tables in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Welch, who was appearing before Congress for the third time in two weeks, 
argued that delaying the program or trimming the numbers of the bomber would 
only boost the plane's price tag of about $530 million apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that would be tantamount to killing the program," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
At an estimated cost of $70 billion, the 132-plane program has generated 
widespread "sticker shock" among lawmakers. Although the House and Senate Armed 
Services committees have rejected bids to kill the program outright, several 
lawmakers plan to propose amendments next week that would delay the program or 
scale back the number of planes built. 
</P>
<P>
Welch told The Times that the Air Force's Capitol Hill effort is designed to 
dissuade "people who would take bites out of the program" rather than to 
convert the "very few" he said would kill the program outright. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the reason we're having this discussion, the reason we're up here 
today, is not because of (the B-2's) performance, its capabilities or its 
needs. It's because of the cost. It's the cost that critics have focused on." 
</P>
<P>
But Welch and Chain saved their strongest rhetoric for the B-2's potential 
impact on arms control. Because of the unique counting scheme proposed for the 
arms agreement with the Soviet Union, they said, the bomber would become a 
nuclear workhorse if the treaty is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Under START constraints, for example, manned penetrating bombers like the B-1B 
and the B-2 would carry one-third of the United States' strategic nuclear 
warheads, the Air Force maintains. Without such constraints, one-quarter of 
such warheads would be carried by bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed START counting rules, each side's arsenal would be limited 
to 6,000 nuclear weapons, of which no more than 4,900 may be carried on 
long-range ballistic missiles. Each bomber aircraft and each air-launched 
cruise missile would count against the remaining 1,100 permissible weapons. The 
B-2, which can carry up to 50,000 pounds of bombs, thus would count only as a 
single weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"As we evaluated the sufficiency of the START positions that we have advanced 
in these negotiations . . . we have particularly counted heavily on the 
contribution of the manned penetrating bomber," Welch said. "I simply cannot 
believe that we could proceed with negotiations on that basis were we to have a 
drastically different expectation about the contribution of the manned 
penetrating bomber."

HUD TO FIRE 4 IN FIELD UNIT, OFFICIALS SAY

Three officials of the Housing and Urban Development Department's troubled 
Washington field office were told Friday they will be fired in 30 days and a 
fourth will be told next Tuesday, HUD officials disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
These are the first people dismissed as part of the department's investigation 
of mismanagement during the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington field office was the base of operations of escrow agent Marilyn 
Louise Harrell, who became known as "Robin HUD" after she confessed to 
diverting $5.5 million of the department's money to charities. 
</P>
<P>
The four officials were placed on leave in June, then given temporary 
assignments at headquarters when their leaves expired earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
They are Margaret White, former head of the office; Robert B. Warner, director 
of housing management; Charles W. Womble, loan specialist, and Everett 
Rothschild, head of property disposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lax Controls Found 
</P>
<P>
An audit of the office found that lax financial and management controls allowed 
agents like Harrell to delay transfers of funds or not make them at all. 
Auditors have estimated the office is missing a total of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, who made known the dismissal notices on condition they not be 
identified, said all but Rothschild were given letters informing them they will 
be dismissed in 30 days unless they can refute charges of mismanagement against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild is out of town and will be given his letter on Tuesday, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
White had wide support among Washington politicians and many protested when she 
was placed on leave. The District Urban League also wrote Secretary Jack Kemp a 
protest letter. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech Friday to agency workers at the swearing in of HUD's new general 
counsel, Francis Keating, Kemp repeated his pledge to root out fraud and 
mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp told the workers he would have "zero tolerance" for mismanagement and said 
any employees who felt they could not live up to higher standards should quit.

Despite a barrage of criticism from religious fundamentalists, the authors of 
proposed guidelines for science textbooks refused Friday to back away from 
their recommendation that evolution be taught as accepted fact in California 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that prompted fundamentalists to demand the resignation of its 
chairman, the Science Committee of the California Curriculum Commission agreed 
to make no "substantive" changes in its controversial proposal. The committee 
decided to delay its request for a formal commission endorsement until 
September, however, to give it more time to prepare the document. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's war they want, it's war they're going to get," said the Rev. Louis 
Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition. "The issue still 
continues to be the same -- that this framework is stating that evolution is a 
fact. When it does that then it (evolution) becomes a religion de facto."

which had been scheduled to vote on the proposed guidelines Friday, presents 
recommendations to the 11-member state Board of Education, which then makes the 
final decision. 
</P>
<P>
Fundamentalist religious groups had demanded that all references to the 
teaching of evolution as fact be erased from the proposed framework and that it 
make provisions for science teachers to present other theories on the origin of 
man, including creationism. 
</P>
<P>
After an informal review of the Science Committee's proposed framework, the 
state board urged the committee in a letter to modify the guidelines so they no 
longer included "an advocacy statement for evolution." 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Science Committee) have now thumbed their noses at the state board's 
request, which probably will lead to an impending crisis this fall," Sheldon 
said. "The Curriculum Commission and its Science Committee are on a collision 
course with the board, and the board is going to have to dump somebody, and 
we're calling for the committee chairman's resignation. She needs either to 
resign, be fired or repent." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Discussion 
</P>
<P>
"I'm leaning toward repentance," said Elizabeth Stage, the professor who now 
heads the California Science Project at the University of California's 
statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
Stage, a prime author of the proposed framework, said in working on the 
document, the committee will answer the board's request by providing additional 
discussion in the guidelines on why scientists say evolution is a fact. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, it will discuss the facts, the evidence on which the theory is 
based. The facts and the evidence about which there is not much doubt," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will also address criticism of the various theories within 
evolution, she said, but "substantively we won't change" the framework. 
</P>
<P>
People for the American Way, a 270,000-member organization that has promoted 
the teaching of evolution, said the committee's decision -- while a "defeat for 
anti-evolution forces" -- will now mean both sides will be focusing their 
attention on the state board. 
</P>
<P>
"The battle is far from over as the anti-evolution forces will put a full-court 
press on the members of the Board of Education," said Michael Hudson, Western 
director for the organization.

Police raided a summer camp in northern Israel for Israeli Arab children, 
charging it has been used by radical Arabs to promote the Palestinian uprising, 
a police commander said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Police Thursday arrested the camp director and two counselors from the Israeli 
Arab village of Shfaram on suspicion of subversive political activities, said 
Shmuel Mermelstein, commander of Shfaram village police. 
</P>
<P>
The woman and two men arrested are members of the radical Palestinian Sons of 
the Village movement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that camp for children aged 4 to 15 contained placards with Palestinian 
slogans "everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Posters with Palestinian slogans and songs were hung at the entrance of the 
camp. Painted on a large piece of cardboard, the words to the song, "My Eyes 
Are Fixed on the Poor Prisoners Who Are Rotting in the Israeli Prisons," was 
posted on a tree, police said.

CHILEANS FACE DOWNSIDE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH -- STAGGERING AIR POLLUTION 
</P>

SANTIAGO, Chile 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a clear winter day in downtown Santiago, you can see a couple of blocks. 
Overhead, the sky is blue, but at street level the view gives way to a 
rat-colored haze. The Chilean capital is choking on its own prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
By most measures, Santiago is the world's third most-polluted city, after 
Mexico City and Sao Paulo, Brazil. Every winter season, roughly May to August 
in the Southern Hemisphere, thermal inversions in these windless skies trap 
sour, noxious smog on the floor of Santiago's valley. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, geography is a factor. Stunning mountains, rarely seen in winter, 
encircle the city, and access on three sides is by tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Headlong Race 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, Chile's headlong race toward economic development, 
with few environmental controls, has brought pollution to crisis levels -- made 
especially acute this winter by the absence of rain to clean the air. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution meters, newly improved to give more accurate assessments, registered 
"critical" or "dangerous" levels on nine days from May 1 to mid-June. Most of 
the rest of the time there were readings of "fair" or "bad," which doctors 
describe as perilously dirty. 
</P>
<P>
This unprecedented filth has suddenly produced a consensus in favor of costly 
and imaginative changes that would create a better balance between growth in a 
Third World country and environmental safety. 
</P>
<P>
Facing growing public pressure, the government invoked emergency measures for 
the first time in late June, ordering half the buses off the roads and closing 
50 industries until the levels of pollution dropped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reviving Trolleys 
</P>
<P>
Longer-term proposals include re-creating a network of electric trolley-buses 
that were phased out in recent decades and a toll system for vehicles graded 
according to their contamination output. 
</P>
<P>
"All countries pass through a phase of terrible pollution," Dr. Mario Munoz, 
director of the government Environmental Health Department, said recently. 
"Governments prefer to encourage industrialization, forgetting the hazards, 
until the people demand change. Now we are seeking solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Chile's problem comes less from gases such as carbon monoxide and ozone than 
from particulates -- mainly hydrocarbons from incompletely burned fuels, 
especially the fuel burned in diesel buses. At their worst, the levels of 
particulates have exceeded 500 micrograms per cubic meter, over the top of the 
scale. This has occurred on six days in recent weeks and at one station reached 
a record 878 on June 9. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards dictate that more than 150 
micrograms per cubic meter is unacceptable. The highest reading at a Los 
Angeles-area testing station in 1988 was 289. 
</P>
<P>
Every winter in the Santiago Valley, which is home to 4.5 million of Chile's 12 
million people, hospitals are packed with respiratory patients suffering from a 
variety of afflictions linked more or less directly to the foul air. 
</P>
<P>
One day recently at Luis Calvo McKenna Hospital, a major pediatric hospital for 
Santiago, dozens of mothers filled the emergency waiting room with their 
wheezing, gasping infants and toddlers. Inside, doctors gave most of the 
children oxygen for a couple of hours, placed them in purified plastic 
enclosures and gave them injections to reduce inflammation in the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Claudio Alegria, acting director of the hospital, said respiratory 
illnesses have always been common in Chile during winter, when cold and rain 
contribute to viruses. This year, there has been drought, but the number of 
cases has remained constant, he said, "which makes us think that the smog is 
keeping the levels high." 
</P>
<P>
"We can resolve the medical problems easily, but the child then goes back out 
into the same environment, and he needs to come back here three or four days 
later," Alegria said. "The hydrocarbon particulates are the worst because they 
are so small that they penetrate the smallest pores of the lungs." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Quintero Aguilera was waiting with her 2 1/2-month-old son, Nicholas, to 
see a doctor for the second time in four days. The boy was red-faced and 
struggling for breath. Like many others, including specialists, Quintero said 
she could not be certain about the smog's role in such illnesses -- but she 
knew her baby was suffering, and she blamed the bad air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Crying and Suffering' 
</P>
<P>
"The eyes go red, the breathing is difficult," she said. "They gave us this 
oxygen spray can and a tube to give him clean air when he fights to breathe, 
but it doesn't help much. He quiets down and can sleep a few hours, but he 
wakes up and starts crying and suffering again." 
</P>
<P>
Lionel Gil, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Chile, found in a 
recent study that the particulate pollution in Santiago includes seven 
cancer-causing substances, among them benzopyrene. Depending on his success in 
getting funding, he plans more research to try to measure the actual threat to 
humans from these carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem we could have in Santiago," he said in an interview, "is that 
these genetic mutations can 'sleep' for 20 years and then transform into tumors 
in the body. So, we may not see the impact of the contamination now but in 10 
or 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
The number of recorded fatalities from lung and bronchial tumors in one annual 
survey rose from 500 to 1,400 from 1960 to 1985, Gil said, at a time when 
cigarette smoking declined and better treatment for these diseases reduced the 
fatality rate. He emphasized that it is impossible to link that increase 
definitively with air pollution, for lack of adequate research. 
</P>
<P>
"One doesn't want to alarm the population," he said, "but people should know 
the risks. Countries usually think about their environment when they have 
already developed, but by then the damage may already have been done." 
</P>
<P>
The pollution "is a result of economic development without regard for the 
environment," Gil said. He noted that the number of vehicles in Santiago 
increased from 358,000 in 1985 to 423,000 in 1987 and estimated that the number 
will be 500,000 by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Chileans of all political shades are caught up in the debate over what to do, 
and this is regarded as a vital first step in dealing with the problem. Many 
want the environment to be a major issue in the election campaign to choose a 
successor to President Augusto Pinochet in December. 
</P>
<P>
Students take part in pollution "die-ins" at major intersections, and Roman 
Catholic priests wearing white-gauze face masks have staged protest marches. 
The Roman Catholic cardinal of Santiago recently urged that pollution be made 
an urgent priority to protect the people, especially the young and the aged. 
</P>
<P>
Humberto Jorquera, a professor of engineering and adviser to the Transport 
Ministry, said developing countries "have had to sacrifice the optimum for the 
possible." After years of comparatively healthy growth, he said, society is 
focusing on the hidden costs in improved health care. 
</P>
<P>
Jorquera is in charge of longer-term planning, including the trolley-bus 
program that will soon become a reality. The main source of particulate 
pollutants in Santiago is the bus system: 11,500 aging, diesel-powered buses. 
</P>
<P>
Exemplifying the hazardous priorities of the past, in the 1950s and 1960s, bus 
operators were urged to convert from gasoline to cheaper diesel, and 
trolley-buses were phased out. 
</P>
<P>
The private bus fleet, allowed to grow willy-nilly during the free-market 
Pinochet years, must be reduced substantially, most analysts agree, and the 
remaining buses need to be better maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Jorquera said the inspection system was revamped in January and that buses 
built before 1968 were ordered out of service. Since then, 2,000 more buses 
have been retired, although many are believed to be operating clandestinely. 
</P>
<P>
A pilot program has put 16 buses on the roads using a variety of alternative 
sources of fuel and catalytic converters, and studies are under way on creating 
electric-powered suburban rail lines to exploit the hydroelectric potential 
from the nation's wealth of rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Guido Girardi, a health expert for the opposition Party for Democracy, 
estimates that the cost of smog-related visits to doctors reaches $5 million a 
year. Living in Santiago, he said, is like smoking 10 to 20 cigarettes a day. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that a Japanese scientist, Hiroshi Kiwi of the Fukuoka Environmental 
Research Center, ranks Santiago No. 1 in the world in qualitative terms of 
pollution, with particulate levels 20 times higher than in other industrial 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Jorquera put it this way: "Pollution is the most democratic of afflictions. It 
affects everyone, regardless of their beliefs. Yet, the concern about air 
pollution in Santiago is only about five years old. Historically, we all share 
the blame. "

MUSEUM BOOSTERS SEEK TO CAPTURE SAN DIEGUITO'S ESSENCE FOR HISTORY

Nowadays, when Frank Knechtel gazes across the expansive Carmel Valley, he can 
only dream of what once was -- field after field of lima beans, one of North 
County's staple crops for much of this century. 
</P>
<P>
In the Depression years, when Knechtel was a boy racing about his father's 
farm, more than a hundred lima bean growers thrived between Del Mar and 
Carlsbad. Twenty years later, his own lima bean crop sprawled across 500 
fertile acres. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Knechtel (pronounced Necktel) is one of the last lima bean growers left 
in San Diego County. And, after this year, even he is calling it quits. 
</P>
<P>
But the 72-year-old is leaving behind a little memento of those years when 
farmers like himself worked their fields under the scorching Southern 
California sun. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's a rather large memento -- a 40-by-14-foot lima bean harvester 
that has been used to help reap North County bean crops for much of the past 
half century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of Many Donations 
</P>
<P>
The harvester is one of scores of objects d'history that have been donated for 
a proposed San Dieguito Heritage Museum, which a group of residents wants to 
see built in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
The mementos include old photographs, horse-drawn buggies, antiques and Indian 
artifacts, many of which hark back more than 100 years to an era when North 
County was being settled by the first waves of ambitious European and Japanese 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
But none, perhaps, are as large -- or as cherished -- as Frank Knechtel's 
harvester. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked me about the harvester, and I said I'd donate it when they have a 
place to put it," he said. "I think that would be a better place for it than 
some junkyard -- where it would probably end up because there's nobody else 
around here with any use for it." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed museum is the dream of a cadre of Encinitas residents who are 
trying to interest local officials in helping them locate a tract on which to 
build their monument. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, members of the San Dieguito Heritage Museum steering committee 
escorted Encinitas Mayor Anne Omsted and other city officials to the Oceanside 
Heritage Park and Museum, betting that a tour of another local museum would 
spark their curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get some ideas on just how the Oceanside museum has been such 
a success and inspire our city officials to follow their lead," said Maura 
Wiegand, museum steering committee president, whose family also was in the lima 
bean growing business. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for an Encinitas-area history museum has circulated for years, longer 
than the recently incorporated city has been around. 
</P>
<P>
"Just drive around and you see so many artifacts and memorabilia people have 
kept around for three and four generations, you know, little objects that speak 
so well of the past just sitting around in people's home and yards, not being 
treated as well as they should be," Wiegand said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the makings of a very nice collection already donated. Now we just 
need a place to put a museum." 
</P>
<P>
The group has raised $25,000 and has even received offers of ready-made 
buildings to house the collection. Now they hope city officials will help them 
locate a benefactor to donate a 2- to 5-acre tract of land -- preferably in 
Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Touching History 
</P>
<P>
"We want part of our museum to be set aside strictly for children, a hands-on 
area so they can learn about the past by reaching out and touching it," Wiegand 
said. "We want an archives for documents and photographs and an outdoor area to 
show how people once lived on this land." 
</P>
<P>
That outdoor area, most likely, will be the last resting place for the lima 
bean harvester that served Frank Knechtel so well for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a day when there was a lot of need for this harvester," Knechtel 
recalled. "We used to use it to go from farm to farm and harvest the crops. 
There was a community spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the land got too valuable just to raise beans. They figured it was better 
to put houses on it." 
</P>
<P>
Now those houses have closed to within a quarter mile of Knechtel's precious 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
"That's progress," he said. "You just have to accept it. I just hope they build 
this place to preserve a little bit of the past as well." 
</P>

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: JUGGLING HOUSES WON'T ERASE TAX WOES

QUESTION: I read with interest and some remorse your recent column on buying a 
new home for less than you sold your original house. I was certainly unaware of 
the potential tax consequences of doing this. But I got to wondering if there 
was a possible way out of the problem, since I now face a huge tax bill. 
Suppose I sell my less-expensive second house within the two years I am allowed 
to find a replacement house of equal or greater value than the first and then 
buy a third house that is more expensive than what I sold the first one for? 
Will this nullify my tax problem? -- L. G. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Not entirely, but your tax problem could be eased. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the situation. The Internal Revenue Service says you are liable for 
taxes on any profit that you realize from the sale of your principal residence 
that you do not invest in a new home. (Homeowners over age 55 are allowed to 
shelter $125,000, but that's the only exception to the law.) The IRS gives you 
24 months in which to buy a replacement house. According to our experts, the 
government allows you to designate the house to be considered this replacement 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the plan you have suggested could work. Let's say you sold your 
original house for $500,000 and bought a replacement for $350,000. You would 
potentially face paying taxes on $150,000 worth of gain that was not 
reinvested. But if within that 24-month period, you sold this second residence 
and bought a third for $600,000 and designated that house as your replacement 
one, the original tax bill would be erased. 
</P>
<P>
However, you would face taxes on any gain you realized from the sale of the 
second residence. So, if that second house sold for $380,000, you would be 
taxed on a $30,000 gain that was not reinvested because you are not allowed to 
reinvest gains from two houses into a third. 
</P>
<P>
Also, be prepared to file an amended tax return for the year of the first sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Choosing Between Ex-Husbands' Benefits 
</P>
<P>
Q: I was married for the first time for 21 years. My second marriage lasted 10 
years. Which ex-husband's Social Security benefits may I apply for? I 
understand that I am technically eligible to apply for either one's benefits 
since both marriages lasted at least 10 years before the divorce. But I know 
that my first ex-husband's Social Security account is larger. How do I find out 
how much money I would be entitled to draw under his account when I reach 
retirement age, and how do I get his Social Security number? -- S. B. 
</P>
<P>
A: You are allowed to draw Social Security benefits under the accounts of 
whichever ex-spouse you wish. No doubt you will choose the account of the "ex" 
whose earnings were higher and who is entitled to the higher benefits. However, 
if you were still married to husband No. 2, you would not be able to claim the 
benefits of husband No. 1, even if his account were more attractive. (There is 
one exception: If you remarried after age 60 and your former spouse has died, 
you are entitled to claim benefits on your deceased spouse even if you are 
currently married.) 
</P>
<P>
You can obtain the Social Security number of your ex-spouse by contacting your 
local Social Security office and giving them all the identifying information 
you have. Your ex-husband's birth date, last known address, employers, mother's 
maiden name and birthplace are some of the important facts you should collect. 
Also be prepared to prove that you are an ex-spouse who is entitled to draw 
benefits. At the very least, you will need to produce a marriage and divorce 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
A Social Security worker will open a file for you and help you get the 
information and benefits to which you are entitled. By the way, the payment 
rate for ex-spouses is 50% of the primary wage earner's benefits, minus a 
certain percentage if you elect to draw Social Security benefits before turning 
age 65. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Give Away Money Tax-Free 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know that an individual may give up to $10,000 tax-free to another 
individual each year. But I don't exactly understand the timing. Does the 
Internal Revenue Service require these gifts to be made a year apart, or could 
they conceivably be made in December of one year and again in January of the 
next year? This is a very pressing problem for me and I cannot get either my 
attorney or accountant to give me an answer. -- E. L. F. 
</P>
<P>
A: Oh, dear. There's no reason to get upset about this. Nor is there any reason 
your attorney or accountant couldn't have given you an answer. It's all rather 
simple. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the IRS is concerned, what counts is the calendar year in which you 
make your gift. You may give $10,000 to someone in December and turn around and 
do it again in January; the gifts could be made a month apart or a day apart.

Withdrawing Funds From a 5-Year Account 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1987, when I was 64 years old, I rolled over a $28,000 pension payout 
into an individual retirement account. The account was a five-year certificate 
of deposit paying 8.6% interest. I remember signing a form calling for a 
penalty for early withdrawal. Now I am wondering if I can take all or part of 
my account out and transfer it into another IRA without being penalized. -- S. 
K. 
</P>
<P>
A: In all likelihood, the agreement you signed leaves you liable for an early 
withdrawal penalty from your savings institution should you decide to move your 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simply that you agreed to make a five-year investment; you cannot 
withdraw your funds before this investment matures. The nature and type of 
penalty will be set by the institution, not the government, which only imposes 
a penalty if you withdraw and use your IRA funds before turning age 59 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
If your IRA were in a shorter-term investment or an account that permitted you 
access to it, you would not face this penalty. The government allows all IRA 
holders to move their accounts without penalty if the transaction is completed 
within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, the penalty you face from the savings and loan institution would be 
imposed regardless of whether your funds were being held in an IRA or some 
other type of savings account. The institution is merely enforcing the maturity 
date of the investment you made.

Ingersoll-Rand: The Woodcliff Lake, N.J., industrial equipment manufacturer 
reported record second-quarter earnings of $52.4 million, up 30.7% from the 
same period a year ago. Sales were up 16.4% to $907.4 million. The firm 
attributed the profit rise to sales increases in every segment of the company.

FACES . . .: A HI-BYE GIRL RECALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Betty Garrett is still amazed that fans remember her from her stints on 
"Laverne &amp; Shirley" and "All in the Family." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't knock it," she says of the recognition. "But it's hard to believe 
those parts made such an impression. I always felt I had very little to do on 
the shows. I was lucky if I had one scene. Rue McClanahan, who was on 'Maude,' 
used to refer to us as the 'hi-bye girls.' You came through the door, said 
'Hi,' told a joke, said 'Bye' -- and that was your part for the week." 
</P>
<P>
Although the actress enjoyed her six years on "Laverne &amp; Shirley," there 
were no regrets when the series was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"I was actually kind of glad," she says. "You drive on the lot every day, the 
guard says, 'Good morning, Miss Garrett,' you have your own parking space, a 
dressing room with a refrigerator and typewriter -- it's like another little 
home. The whole thing gets dangerously comfortable. When it was over, I 
realized I hadn't been doing a lot of the creative work I'd wanted to do. So 
that really got me off the dime." 
</P>
<P>
The result was a one-woman show of anecdotes and music, "Betty Garrett and 
Other Songs" (Theatre West, 1974, and Westwood Playhouse, 1976). Now she is 
back with a new piece, "No Dogs or Actors Allowed," at the Pasadena Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no singing in this one," she says. "And it's not so much about my 
life, although some of the stories are about me. They're famous theatrical 
stories, dealing with the trials and tribulations actors go through -- most of 
them funny . . . at least the ones I talk about." Props are limited to a sign, 
a chair and an on-stage music stand with Garrett's cue sheets. "When you tell a 
bunch of stories," she says with a laugh, "it's hard to remember what comes 
next." 
</P>
<P>
The title, "No Dogs or Actors Allowed," refers to housing prejudices that 
theater people faced in turn-of-the-century Britain. "We've come a long way," 
Garrett says, "but I'm still not sure the public really trusts us. How often 
have you heard a mother say, 'I wish my daughter would meet a nice young actor 
and get married' -- or a father who says, 'Why do you want to be a lawyer? Why 
don't you go into something respectable like the theater?' " JANICE ARKATOV

FACES . . .: FILM TOO 'TECHNICAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PECCHIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"They get into the technical (stuff); how wonderful this shot is, or that 
special effect. They don't show the humanity of the people anymore, like they 
did in the Spencer Tracy movies." 
</P>
<P>
So laments Frederic Forrest, the veteran character actor and Oscar nominee (for 
"The Rose") about these newfangled movies that tend to favor hardware over 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
The gravelly voiced actor hails his new movie, "Valentino Returns," as a 
throwback to the days when movies put a lump in your throat. Forrest plays a 
philandering '50s lounge singer whose wife abruptly leaves him and whose 
teen-age son has just obtained a sparkling new pink Cadillac, which he takes 
out to find adventure, romance and sex -- but only finds trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Forrest, having been directed by the likes of Francis Coppola, Costa-Gavras and 
Arthur Penn, did wage the occasional battle with first-time director Peter 
Hoffman on this project. 
</P>
<P>
"We fought a lot, and I was kind of hard on him, but I had to tell him the 
actor's viewpoint," says Forrest, while stressing that Hoffman showed growth 
throughout the shoot. "He'd been to film school and so forth, he didn't know 
the acting experience as well as someone who had come out of the Actors Studio, 
but he handled it very well." 
</P>
<P>
Forrest is finishing up his stint on "The Two Jakes," which "Joker" Jack 
Nicholson directs and stars. Forrest, God help him, was on the set the day 
after Nicholson's beloved Los Angeles Lakers were swept clean away by the 
Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
"Awww, Jack was OK," said Forrest, who once sauntered up to Nicholson, hoping 
to enlighten him with a Lakers-Pistons update. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't mention it, you snake," says Forrest, affecting an impeccable imitation 
of Nicholson, "talk to me later, 'cause I taped it." DAVID PECCHIA

PIANIST MARCUS ROBERTS MAKES HIS LOCAL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a temporary leave of absence from the Wynton Marsalis Quintet, the widely 
praised 25-year-old pianist Marcus Roberts made his local debut as a leader 
Thursday at the Vine Street Bar &amp; Grill, heading his own acoustic quintet. 
</P>
<P>
Like Marsalis, Roberts has elected to pattern himself along the lines of the 
1960s hard-bop groups, using mostly conventional instrumentation and material, 
with trumpet, saxophone, bass and drums for company. 
</P>
<P>
If Roberts has not yet found a strongly individual route to follow, he 
compensates through his often ingenious incorporation of a variety of early 
keyboard styles. 
</P>
<P>
Three pervasive elements of the set were the blues, John Coltrane and 
Thelonious Monk. Of the six tunes, four had a blues basis, beginning with 
Roberts' own "Country by Choice," continuing with Monk's "Blue Bolivar Blues" 
and ending with the quirky "Raise Four." A Todd Williams original entitled "For 
Coltrane" (also a blues) showcased well-crafted soprano and tenor sax solos by 
Herbert Harris III, whose other feature, "I Wish I Knew," is a 1945 pop song 
best known through Coltrane's recording. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the group were the capable Scotty Barnhart on trumpet, and two young 
musicians from St. Louis, Maurice Carnes on drums and Chris Thomas on bass. The 
latter pair had a little trouble establishing the steady, sympathetic pulse 
that could have given the rhythm section a fuller measure of cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, only the opening "Country by Choice" was excerpted from Roberts' 
successful debut album. He would be well-advised to use more items from that 
diversified collection. We bow to no one in our admiration for the blues, but 
isn't four of six a trifle excessive? 
</P>
<P>
Roberts closes Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER

SWING AND SWAY THE SERGIO MENDES WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All that's left of the latest wave of Brazilian music that has swept the United 
States in the last few years is the commercial backwash. Witness recent albums 
by Djavan and Ivan Lins, whose Brazilian roots seem to have been more affected 
by American pop music than the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
That's why it was refreshing to hear Sergio Mendes and his latest group, Brazil 
99, play to a near-capacity Strand Supper and Dance Club Thursday night. Over 
his long career, Mendes has never presented himself as anything but a pop 
artist. One of the first musicians to introduce Brazilian rhythms and lyricism 
to Top 40 charts, Mendes has nevertheless not forgotten the source of his 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Mendes makes no bones about giving in to the temptations of the pop/rock 
allure. The latest edition of his band is orchestrated with electric bass and 
guitar, and his synth and electric piano are supplemented by an additional rack 
of electronic keyboards manned by Steve Bach. 
</P>
<P>
But the majority of the tunes that he and the group performed, and certainly 
those that met with the greatest reception, were heavily flavored with 
Brazilian touches: percussive play, swaying samba rhythms and the beautiful 
sounds of the Portuguese language. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the various Mendes editions has always rested with the strength 
of his vocalists, and he was well-represented this night. Singers Angie Jaree, 
Kevyn Lettau and Mendes' wife, Gracinha Mendes, provided smooth, lyrical 
sensuousness, whether singing in unison or exchanging solo lines in English and 
Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
Mendes' brief keyboard breaks were played with passion and brief displays of 
agility, but were so short they added little to the overall mood. The guitar of 
Dori Caymmi, a Brazilian star in his own right, was, for the most part, buried 
under the mix. 
</P>
<P>
The attractiveness of this music is its danceability, and by the end of the set 
the audience was swinging and swaying. The dinner tables were removed from the 
dance floor for the second set and then the real party began. 
</P>
<P>
Mendes will appear tonight at the Ventura Concert Theatre. BILL KOHLHAASE

PLANT OF THE WEEK: CATALPA CHILOPSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FRENCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chitalpa 
</P>
<P>
A cross between Catalpa bignonioides and Chilopsis linearis 
</P>
<P>
Deciduous, flowering tree, to 30 feet 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the chitalpa is a striking tree, but the most interesting thing about 
it may be its background. A cross between two native American trees, the common 
catalpa and the desert willow, its roots are in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main purposes of botanical gardens in the Soviet Union is to test 
and introduce new plants for potential use in the various climates of that 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The climate of the Botanical Garden of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences in 
Taschkent is not unlike the Southwestern part of the United States: It is hot 
and dry, and the summers are without rain. From seeds probably obtained through 
a seed exchange list, Catalpa bignonioides, popular in the East, and Chilopsis 
linearis, from the Southwest, were crossed. The result, which is now called 
"chitalpa," was first described in 1964 in a botanical journal in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds and cuttings of the chitalpa were obtained by the United States in 1977 
through an international botanical exchange program under the direction of Dr. 
Thomas S. Elias, now director of the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden in 
Claremont. The specimens were taken to the New York Botanical Garden, where 
they were grown and, in 1982, distributed to growers and other botanical 
gardens in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Chitalpa has "a lot of potential as a medium-size ornamental tree," Elias says, 
with "the best qualities of both parents." It is drought resistant and takes 
the cold to about minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. In Southern California, it 
begins to bloom in March and can go strong all the way until September. The 
big, catalpa-like pale-pink flowers bloom in branched, upright clusters. The 
leaves of catalpas are broad and rounded, and those of desert willows are 
narrow. Chitalpa leaves are narrow and elliptical, giving the tree a light and 
airy appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Rounded in overall form and growing to about 30 feet, it tends to be 
multi-trunked with low, spreading branches to 18 to 20 feet. (If left to its 
own, it cannot be walked under.) Most trees available in Southern California 
are trained to standard tree, or lollipop, form. 
</P>
<P>
This is what is called an intergeneric hybrid -- hybrids are usually crossed 
species, but the parents of chitalpa are from different genera (however, they 
are closely related -- from the same family, Bignoniaceae). The offspring have 
yet to produce fruit or seed, but the plant roots easily from cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
One drawback to the new tree is that it can get leaf mildew as crape myrtles 
do. 
</P>
<P>
Chitalpa trees can be seen now, in bloom, at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden, 
planted in the parking lot and in the Experimental Garden. At age 6 or 7, they 
are 12 to 14 feet tall, about half the size they're going to be when mature. 
</P>
<P>
Available from local nurseries, which can order 5-gallon containers directly 
from Monrovia Nursery Co. in Azusa. LINDA FRENCH

FAMILY SPOTS: COMIC 'CRUISE' TO KICK OFF MOVIE SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN MELINKOFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If this summer's movie schedule of flying super-heroes and shrunken kids seems 
too big and too slick, then head for Paramount Ranch on Sunday night for a peek 
at movie-making at its simple best. 
</P>
<P>
"Silents Under the Stars" begins its second season Sunday night with a 
screening of the silent film "The Cruise of the Jasper B," starring Rod 
LaRocque (now there's a name). 
</P>
<P>
Families are encouraged to come early and picnic in the rolling hills of 
Paramount Ranch, which has been a popular location for Western films and 
television productions since the silent-film era. 
</P>
<P>
The screening will be in the open-sides pavilion, originally built by Paramount 
Studios to house large props during the 1920s and '30s. In the film, Jerry 
Cleggett (LaRocque) must marry on the rotting deck of the cruise ship in order 
to inherit the family fortune. He rejects a sea of hopefuls for an impoverished 
heiress, and together they make their way through comic obstacles to the altar. 
</P>
<P>
The film begins at dusk, about 8:15 p.m. To reach Paramount Ranch, take the 
Kanan Road exit south from U.S. 101. Drive three-quarters of a mile south to 
the left-hand turn lane. Turn left, then immediately right onto Cornell Road. 
Continue 2 1/2 miles to ranch entrance. Flashlights are recommended. 
Reservations are suggested: (213) 874-2276 or (818) 888-3770. Tickets are $6. 
</P>
<P>
The series continues on Aug. 20 at 7:45 p.m. with "Hotel Imperial," starring 
Pola Negri, and ends with "The Mark of Zorro" with Douglas Fairbanks at 7:15 
p.m. on Sept. 17. The programs are sponsored by the National Park Service, 
Hollywood Heritage and the Silent Society.

DAY HIKE: PINE MOUNTAIN VISTAS OF PEAKS AND VALLEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The invigorating scent of pine, great views and a dramatic ridgetop trail are 
some of the highlights of a hike atop Pine Mountain. The mountain, which 
straddles the Mt. Pinos and Ojai ranger districts in Los Padres National 
Forest, is composed of several 7,000-foot-plus peaks, each offering a different 
back-country panorama. 
</P>
<P>
Wilderness-bound travelers have always had a difficult task in deciding what to 
call the rugged mountain terrain arranged in a very wide semicircle around Ojai 
and Santa Barbara. The padres left behind many names, but none of them took. 
Geologists aren't much help either. They call the land the "Transverse Ranges 
Geomorphic Province." Unlike other areas of Southern California, there isn't a 
single dominant mountain range, but a number of smaller ones with names such as 
Sierra Madre and Santa Ynez, Pine and Topatopa. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever this land of great gorges, sandstone cliffs and wide blue sky is 
called, it's guaranteed to please. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes Peak and Reyes Peak Trail, as well as a nearby camp and creek, are named 
for an early California family that began ranching in the Cuyama Valley in the 
1850s. One descendant, Jacinto Reyes, was among the first forest rangers of the 
Santa Barbara (later Los Padres) National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
For most of its length, Reyes Peak Trail stays atop, or contours just below, 
the ridge top connecting Reyes to its sister peaks. The well-constructed 
footpath is shaded the whole way by white fir, Jeffrey, Ponderosa and sugar 
pines. Inspiring views are offered from uninspiringly named Peaks 7,091, 7,114 
and 7,416, as well as from the saddles between the summits. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: From U.S. 101 in Ventura, exit on California 33 
and head north 47 miles (32 miles past Ojai) to the signed turnoff for Pine 
Mountain Recreation Area. Follow the narrow paved road past some campgrounds. 
After six miles, the paved surface ends, and you'll continue east one more mile 
on a dirt road (suitable for most passenger cars) to road's end, where there's 
a modest amount of parking. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Follow the dirt road (closed to vehicles beyond the trailhead) about 
150 yards. As the road curves southeast, join the unsigned eastbound trail that 
begins on the east side of the road. The trail descends slightly and soon 
passes below the pine- and boulder-covered summit of Reyes Peak (7,500 feet), 
high point of the Pine Mountain massif. Pine and fir shade the trail, which 
alternately follows the ridge line and contours just below it. 
</P>
<P>
You'll look down to the northwest at the farms and ranches of Cuyama Valley, 
and beyond to the stark sandstone Cuyama Badlands. 
</P>
<P>
There are occasional pine-framed views of Mt. Pinos (elevation 8,831 feet), 
highest peak in Los Padres National Forest. From the ridgetop, you'll be able 
to peer southwest down into the Sespe River gorge. 
</P>
<P>
After about 1 3/4 miles of travel, you'll be treated to a view of the canyon 
cut by Potrero John Creek. The eroded cliffs at the head of the canyon recall 
Utah's Bryce Canyon National Park or Cedar Breaks National Monument. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes Peak Trail continues east through pine and fir forests. After two more 
miles of travel, you'll spot an orange, triangular-shaped, metal forest-service 
marker. 
</P>

CROWDS CUE UP AT CHIC POOL HALL; 
</P>
<P>
THE LAST BASTION OF BLUE-COLLAR MANLINESS FALLS TO YUPPIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The pool hall, the last bastion of blue-collar manliness, has gone chic. 
</P>
<P>
Q's Billiard Club recently opened on the 11800 block of Wilshire Boulevard with 
smoking and nonsmoking sections (although no cigars or pipes), a dress code, a 
doorman, valet parking and waitresses serving drinks and food. 
</P>
<P>
Although open only a month, there are already lines to get in on Friday and 
Saturday nights and a waiting list to play on one of the 11 (seven nonsmoking) 
pool tables at $10 an hour for two or $15 an hour for four. Playing time is 
limited to an hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Players are escorted to their pool table by a host or hostess, who cleans the 
table of chalk dust and racks up the balls. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the young, attractive, well-dressed crowd -- nearly half women -- 
sip cocktails and imported beers between knocking balls around the red-felt, 
six-pocket pool tables. The women giggle, the men smile as the white cue ball 
misses its target and drops into the corner pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Players can also glance up at wall-mounted televisions showing the latest 
sporting events via cable and a satellite dish. Others waiting for a pool table 
can also watch a large screen television and several smaller screens. 
</P>
<P>
Backgammon, checkers and chess games are also available for patrons to amuse 
themselves while waiting for a table. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen stays open until 1 a.m. weeknights and until 1:30 a.m. Fridays and 
Saturdays. The menu consists of chicken, ribs, burgers and salad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Term 'Billiard Club' Preferred 
</P>
<P>
But hold the California jokes, please. The upscale pool hall -- the owners 
prefer the term "billiard club" -- is not the first of its kind. The honor, 
according to entertainment publicist Richard Lewis, belongs to Chelsea 
Billiards, which opened last year in New York City. Others have opened since in 
Chicago and Boston, and now there are several in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"People were looking for an alternative way to meet other people away from a 
dance floor and away from inebriated people," Lewis said. "They took the dark, 
musty, seediness out of pool halls and made them bright, with nice carpeting. 
They changed the whole atmosphere of the pool hall. They made it a nice place 
where nice people want to go." 
</P>
<P>
Chelsea Billiards in Manhattan is a 15,000-square-foot, two-level pool hall 
with 53 tables. Like all pool halls licensed in New York City, the sale of 
alcoholic beverages is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Haller, one of the owners, said the idea behind Chelsea Billiards was to 
create a pleasant environment where people could play pool. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing extremely well," Haller said. "We have students as well as men in 
shirts and ties and women in business suits." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said at least two new billiard clubs are planned for Hollywood -- one of 
them, he said, by the former general manager of Chelsea Billiards, who wants to 
build the largest billiard club in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be much more upscale than Q's," Lewis said. "It will have private 
rooms, nice restaurants and probably more than 60 regulation-size tables." 
</P>
<P>
Q's owners say they initially opened their place out of frustration at not 
finding a place to play pool. 
</P>
<P>
Owners Avi Fattal, 33; David Houston, 25, and his wife, Sheri Hellard-Houston, 
24, said they noticed lines at billiard parlors in the Westside and the San 
Fernando Valley, where they live. They decided that by drawing from that 
existing demand and catering to affluent Westsiders, they could create a new 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to create a combination of a sports bar, a restaurant and a pool 
hall, yet someplace where women would feel comfortable," Fattal said. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth partner, Yossi Kviatovksy, a billiard table manufacturer, later joined 
the other three. 
</P>
<P>
The owners said they originally hoped to open a place in the Valley, closer to 
their homes, but when a restaurant failed at the current location, they decided 
the Westside was better for the clientele they hoped to attract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clean-Cut Clientele 
</P>
<P>
"Q's is in a location that will cater to yuppies. It's a very clean-cut 
clientele. You're not going to get any Fast Eddies in there," said Lewis, 
referring to the Paul Newman character in the movie "The Hustler." 
</P>
<P>
So far, business has been beyond expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"After a month, we're where we thought we'd be after three months," 
Hellard-Houston said. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely feel comfortable here," said patron Lore Lutz, 26, who has been 
to the club several times. "I like to play pool, and I like to meet people. The 
guys help me play pool. And there are some cute guys here too." 
</P>
<P>
"You can definitely meet women here," said one well-dressed male pool player 
who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Another male player said: "I met a woman attorney here last week, and we went 
home together." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, less than two miles west of Q's on Wilshire, patrons at the more 
traditional House of Billiards greeted the new emporium with a mixture of 
indifference and disdain. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a pool hall, it's just a hangout for yuppies," said Jim Smotherman, 
37, who has been coming to the House of Billiards for 15 years. "I haven't seen 
anyone in (Q's) who knows how to shoot pool." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longtime Player 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing pool since I was 11 or 12 years old," said Ron Hall, 59, 
"but if (Q's) was the only pool hall around, I still would never walk in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
At the House of Billiards, which has occupied the corner of Wilshire Boulevard 
and 19th Street for about 20 years, two players can play evenings at one of 20 
tables for $5.50 an hour, with an extra buck each for a third or fourth player. 
</P>
<P>
No hard alcohol is served, but a draft beer goes for $1.10, a pitcher of beer 
for $4.25, a glass of wine for $1.50 and soft drinks for 50 cents. Pizza slices 
and sandwiches are also served. Bartender Aundre Speciale said the place gets 
full evenings and weekends, with a waiting list for tables most nights.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: U.S. PROBES ILLEGAL DUMPING CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal health officials, responding to a request by Rep. Carlos Moorehead 
(R-Glendale), are investigating allegations that toxic chemicals illegally 
dumped in Placerita Canyon by a defense contractor endangered public health and 
contributed to four deaths in a family that lived near the plant. 
</P>
<P>
If a preliminary study indicates a possible health risk from the chemicals, the 
agency will conduct a comprehensive study on the incidence of cancer and other 
diseases in the community, Mark Bashor, a toxicologist with the Agency for 
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services also is reviewing previous 
studies on the Space Ordnance Systems plant to determine whether a 
comprehensive health survey is warranted.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ESCAPEE GETS 15 YEARS IN OTHER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Victor Age, one of five inmates who escaped from the new federal prison in 
downtown Los Angeles last month, was sentenced to 15 years in prison Friday 
under a law requiring harsh penalties for armed career criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Age, 31, was awaiting sentencing on firearms violations when he and four other 
men hacked through a metal mesh enclosure on an eighth-floor exercise balcony 
of the Metropolitan Detention Center on June 17 and descended to freedom on a 
string of bedsheets. 
</P>
<P>
He was recaptured June 24 in Anaheim.

HONEST ESCAPEE WITH ABYSMAL TASTE IN CLOTHES PROMPTLY LANDS BACK IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps, in retrospect, honesty was not the best policy as far as Edwardo Osuna 
was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Osuna, 18, knocked on a Castaic resident's door Thursday night and asked for a 
change of clothing, explaining -- truthfully -- that he needed new clothes 
because he had just escaped from jail, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowner responded with a red T-shirt bearing the words "Suck 'em Up" -- 
giving Osuna such a distinctive appearance that he might as well have kept his 
jail garb of lime green pants and shirt with the words "L.A. County Jail" on 
the shirt back. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies easily picked him out of a crowd at a fast-food restaurant 
and put him behind bars again. 
</P>
<P>
Osuna and Ismael Mendoza, 25, both serving short terms for narcotics 
convictions, escaped from the minimum security lockup at the Peter Pitchess 
Honor Rancho in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Near midnight, a Castaic resident called the Sheriff's Department and said a 
man had just knocked on his door and asked for clothes, admitting he needed 
them because he had just escaped from jail. 
</P>
<P>
The resident, who was not identified, gave deputies a description of the 
clothes he gave the fugitive -- gray sweat pants and the distinctive T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, deputies spotted Osuna wearing that T-shirt as he asked 
for a ride from people at a McDonald's restaurant on Lake Hughes Road and 
arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza surrendered at the sheriff's station in Valencia at 11:30 a.m. Friday. 
Both inmates were being held in the full security jail and will be charged with 
escape, officials said.

3 TORCHES AT OLD DUMP REIGNITED; 
</P>
<P>
GLENDALE CUT OFF METHANE FLARES TO MEET AQMD ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale officials Friday reignited three fiery torches that burn off methane 
gas leaking from a covered-over landfill, reversing a decision to extinguish 
the flames more than 24 hours earlier that briefly raised fears that the gas 
could gather in nearby areas and explode. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale officials put out the flares at about 7 p.m. Thursday, saying they 
were bowing to a decree from the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
that the equipment at the Scholl Canyon Landfill did not meet state standards. 
</P>
<P>
City officials mounted a 24-hour watch on nearby neighborhoods, looking for 
signs that leaking, but unburned, methane was accumulating. City officials said 
that if they found such signs, they were prepared to defy the AQMD and relight 
the flares, justifying the action on safety grounds. 
</P>
<P>
No gas clouds were located, however, and the incident passed without further 
trouble when the AQMD reversed its order, allowing the flares to be reignited 
at about 8 p.m. Friday. An AQMD spokesman said the agency had not realized its 
order would cause the flares to be turned off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Covered Over 
</P>
<P>
The Scholl Canyon dump is owned by Glendale and operated by Los Angeles County. 
A large portion was closed in 1974, covered over and converted to a golf 
course, tennis courts and sports field. 
</P>
<P>
Methane gas from decomposing trash -- which reaches down to a depth of 245 feet 
beneath the golf course -- leaks from the soil. To dispose of it, the city in 
1983 installed a system that collects the gas and burns it. 
</P>
<P>
Leaks found in the system last September forced closure of the golf course and 
tennis courts. In addition, the city was also ordered to close the entire 
massive recreation center built over the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Since October, the AQMD has been attempting to get the city to replace its old 
system with modern equipment that releases less pollution. 
</P>
<P>
An AQMD hearing board on Thursday ordered the city "to either shut down the 
equipment or to abide by a set of conditions" set by the board to meet emission 
standards, said David Rutherford, an AQMD spokesman. The city was ordered to 
act immediately or face fines of up to $25,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
A roadway into the recreation area was blocked Friday and posted with warning 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
The flares were extinguished, but Glendale City Manager David H. Ramsay warned 
that the AQMD order could result in greater problems from the leaking gas than 
the emissions from the flare system. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay said it was feared that the leaking gas, if not burned, could gather in 
canyon pockets around the landfill, causing odors and posing the danger of an 
explosion. Ramsay complained that the city was forced into "a Catch-22 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variance Denied 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, they have denied our variance to use the flares, and on the 
other hand, we have the concerns about gas migration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, when the AQMD was contacted about the problem Friday by reporters, 
officials said they were surprised that the flares had been extinguished 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not the intention of the hearing board . . . to have the city shut the 
flares down," Rutherford said. "We feel that shutting off the flares could 
cause a potential risk to the public's health and safety." 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay said AQMD officials agreed not to cite the city over the weekend. He 
said city and district officials agreed to meet early Monday "to sit down and 
try to resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale City Council this week awarded a contract to install a new gas 
collection system, which is expected to be completed within a few months, 
officials said.

BIG OVATION FOR GAY MEN'S CHORUS; 
</P>
<P>
ENDORSEMENT BY COFFIN TURNS SNUB OF COLLEAGUE INTO AN INVITATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several months ago, it seemed unlikely that the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles 
or its director would even perform at a national gathering of church people, 
much less earn a warm, enthusiastic response. 
</P>
<P>
But the choir did perform this week and Jon Bailey, the director, called the 
reception "tremendously embracing." The performance drew prolonged applause at 
a packed Claremont worship service from delegates of the Fellowship of United 
Methodists in Worship, Music and Other Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The amicable scene was in marked contrast to what had happened last winter, 
when preacher-activist William Sloane Coffin Jr. threatened to cancel his 
appearance at the conference unless organizers halted their attempt to 
"disinvite" Bailey because of his leadership of the homosexual choir. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bid Based on Credentials 
</P>
<P>
Bailey had been invited to be a consultant for adult choirs at the five-day 
conference at Pomona College that ended Thursday. The invitation was based on 
his musical credentials as chairman of Pomona College's music department and 
former music director at Pasadena Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
"But soon after they found out I was also director of the Gay Men's Chorus, 
basically I was disinvited," Bailey said. "This kind of thing happens all the 
time, and at first I decided to do nothing about it." 
</P>
<P>
But then he resolved to ask Coffin, an old acquaintance who had also been 
invited to participate, for help in appealing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contemporaries at Yale 
</P>
<P>
The two men knew each other at Yale University when Coffin was chaplain and 
Bailey, a Yale Divinity School graduate, taught there. Coffin recently 
completed 12 years as pastor of New York's prestigious Riverside Church and now 
heads a Washington-based group lobbying for reductions in the U.S. military 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Coffin told fellowship leaders that he would not take part 
unless Bailey was retained, according to Bailey and others. In addition, Coffin 
"suggested that since he wanted to do a service focused on AIDS that the Gay 
Men's Chorus be invited to sing," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the 3,500-member fellowship, based in Atlanta, accepted Coffin's 
suggestion. "Once the issue was resolved, I have felt nothing but warmth and 
interest in who we are and how we make music," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Co-Sponsor Withdraws 
</P>
<P>
The only discordant note came from the nondenominational Choristers Guild, 
which withdrew its customary co-sponsorship of the national conference. 
</P>
<P>
The United Methodist Reporter, a Dallas-based weekly, said that correspondence 
between guild and fellowship officials showed that guild directors were willing 
to co-sponsor only if the Gay Men's Chorus was not identified as such in 
printed programs or by word of mouth. The newspaper said some guild directors 
were concerned that its conference sponsorship would imply approval of 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
But fellowship leaders said no. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accented in Program 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the printed program for the 90-minute worship service Monday night 
highlighted the participation of the 10-year-old chorus and its connections 
with the Los Angeles religious community. The group rehearses at Hollywood and 
Wilshire United Methodist churches and this year sang at a Catholic service of 
consecration for AIDS ministers led by Archbishop Roger M. Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
The 140-member chorus -- appearing at half-strength because of vacations -- 
sang five songs, including "Ave Maria." After its closing song, the 
tuxedo-dressed chorus received a standing ovation from about 900 delegates and 
visitors in the Claremont United Church of Christ Congregational. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reaction 'Disgraceful' 
</P>
<P>
Although Coffin declined to comment specifically on the controversy, he told a 
conference workshop that "homophobia" is "a thorn in the flesh of the United 
Methodist Church" and that the church in general "is behaving disgracefully" in 
reactions to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
From the pulpit during the worship service, Coffin suggested -- to much less 
applause than the chorus received -- that both state and church should extend 
their official benefits and blessings to stable, loving gay and lesbian 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
He declared that homosexual communities in major cities have taken the lead in 
providing resources and support to AIDS sufferers. Outside homosexual circles, 
"people have been acting out their fears based on misinformation," Coffin said. 
</P>
<P>
"God is warning us all again that the cost of ignoring truth is higher than the 
pain of seeing it," he added.

MAHONY CITES U.S. ROLE IN MIDEAST PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, back in Los Angeles after leading a U.S. Catholic 
fact-finding trip to the Middle East, said the overwhelming opinion there is 
that peace in the region "requires an active, engaged U.S. policy committed to 
justice and security for the Palestinian people and the people of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
At their Nov. 6-9 meeting in Baltimore, American Catholic bishops will consider 
issuing their first major statement on Middle East tensions since 1978. Mahony 
chairs the committee that will prepare the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony was joined by Archbishop William H. Keeler of Baltimore, another 
committee member, on the five-man delegation that visited the region earlier 
this month. The group made stopovers at the Vatican before and after the trip. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement issued through the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese, 
however, Mahony said little to indicate what recommendations the bishops will 
make. 
</P>
<P>
A principal objective of the trip, Mahony said, was to study the intifada, the 
20-month-long Palestinian uprising against Israeli authorities in occupied 
territories. The Catholic delegation visited refugee camps in Jordan, the West 
Bank and Gaza and held talks with Palestinian activists and Yahva Abdul-Razzah, 
minister of planning and education for the Palestinian Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Another major objective, he said, was to solicit views from a wide range of 
Israelis. The committee met with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Defense 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and made visits to Golan Heights, a kibbutz on the 
Lebanese border and an Israeli settlement on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also met with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and government 
leaders in Syria and Jordan. New York Cardinal John O'Connor, another member of 
the bishops' Middle East committee, visited Lebanon last May. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony added that "local Christian communities in each country" were 
particularly grateful "for the concern expressed by our visits with them."

Fernando Valenzuela overcame early wildness that included four walks in one 
inning to pitch the Dodgers to a 7-3 victory and a split of their doubleheader 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
John Smiley pitched a five-hitter and hit a tainted three-run double in the 
seventh inning as the Pirates won the opener, 4-1, to extend the Dodgers' 
losing streak to four games. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela (5-9) walked four batters in the second but did not allow a run 
because Barry Bonds was caught stealing. Valenzuela checked the Pirates on four 
hits over seven innings, walked six and struck out two in winning for the first 
time since June 24. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Howell worked the last two innings for his 18th save in 20 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall hit his first home run since April 16 in the second, starting a 
string of five one-run innings against Neal Heaton (1-7), who remained winless 
since May 21. Heaton allowed seven hits and five runs in 5 2/3 innings in his 
first start since June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray singled home a run in the third, then doubled and scored on Jeff 
Hamilton's double in the fifth. Alfredo Griffin singled with two out in the 
fourth and eventually scored on shortstop Rey Quinones' fielding error as the 
Dodgers won for the fifth time in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Smiley (8-5) ended a three-game losing streak by striking 
out four and walking two to win for the first time since beating St. Louis, 
5-3, on June 25.

STEWART HAS BRITISH OPEN RECORD OF 65 
</P>

TROON, Scotland

<TEXT>
<P>
Payne Stewart apparently got out of bed on the right side Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart set a Royal Troon record with a seven-under-par 65, putting him two 
strokes behind leader Wayne Grady of Australia after two rounds of the British 
Open. Grady shot a 67 for a total of 135. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said he was disappointed with his 72 Thursday, adding that his wife 
blamed it on his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"She said that I got out of bed with a real stone look on my face," he said. 
"She can tell how I'm going to play by the way I get up." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Stewart was attired in the colors of a National Football League team, 
in keeping with his contract with NFL Properties. He wore the silver and black 
of the Raiders Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said that a morning drizzle benefited those who played early in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"The rain settled the dust, and you could be aggressive with your putts," said 
Stewart, who made an eagle putt of 60 feet from slightly off the sixth green. 
He also had six birdies and a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was tied with Tom Watson for second place at 137. Fred Couples, Steve 
Pate, Scott Simpson, Mark McCumber and Mark Calcavecchia were at 139, which 
means seven Americans are within four strokes of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite, who has been irritated by the British press crowing that an American 
hasn't won a British Open since 1983 and that the European team has won the 
last two Ryder Cup matches, couldn't keep pace with his countrymen Friday. He 
shot a 74 and was at 144. However, He made the cut, which was at 146. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has finished in the top six at the British Open three of the last four 
years. It's the most successful showing by an American since Watson won five 
Opens, the last in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoy playing over here. It tests your patience and imagination in 
hitting different golf shots," Stewart said. "Playing here, you learn how to 
hit bump-and-run shots 30 yards short of the green, and it pays off." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus said at the outset of the tournament that Watson is playing 
better now than he has in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
But Watson, who shot a 68, said he isn't the same dominating player that he was 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the same golfer, but there's still a lot of it in me. I'm not one for 
giving up," he said. "The desire is there because I'm playing well. If you're 
not playing well, desire is a phony thing." 
</P>
<P>
Watson, 39, has won five British Opens, one short of Harry Vardon's record run 
that carried to 1914. And Watson won at Troon in 1982, the last time the Open 
was held here. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some luck, some magic, some bad shots and great shots today. It was a 
typical Tom Watson round. However, I'm in a good position to win," he said. 
"Now I just have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
First, however, Watson and Stewart must contend with Grady, who said he played 
smart, conservative golf. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing everything pretty well at the moment," said Grady, who got his first 
PGA tour victory last June in the Westchester tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"As a boy I always wanted to go to America," said the 32-year-old pro, who 
joined the tour in 1985. "I enjoy the life style there and traveling is much 
easier. And, although I'm a slow developer, I'm a pretty determined person and 
a lot of hard work is paying off." 
</P>
<P>
Grady missed only one green in his round of six birdies and one bogey. 
</P>
<P>
"So far I have not hit the ball in a spot where I've been in trouble," he said. 
"I'm sure I'll be a little jittery tomorrow, but that will make me concentrate 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
Couples shot a 71. Britain's Nick Faldo, a pre-tournament favorite who was 
paired with Couples, also shot a 71 and was at 142, seven strokes behind the 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have to shoot two good rounds to get back in there," said Faldo, who 
won the Masters last April. Curtis Strange, the two-time U.S. Open champion, 
shot a two-over-par 74 and was at 144. Seve Ballesteros had a 73 for a total of 
145. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had holed my five-foot putt at No. 16 for a birdie and parred the last 
two holes, instead of missing all three putts, I would have come in with a 70," 
said Ballesteros, the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm too far behind." 
</P>
<P>
The Scottish-born Lyle, the local favorite, barely made the cut at 146. Ian 
Woosnam of Wales, another pre-tournament favorite, also squeezed in at 146, as 
did Ben Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Wayne Stephens, the first-day leader at 66, shot a par 72 for a 138. 
Stephens received congratulatory phone calls into the night after his 
unexpected showing Thursday. He even watched his round on television, saying: 
"It's quite embarrassing to see yourself on TV." 
</P>
<P>
"Its hard to believe," Stephens said of play thus far. "I hope my name is still 
in the papers on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
The field was reduced to 80 players by the cut, with 33 Americans making the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Said McCumber, who shot a 68 (139): "I feel I'm right on the cutting edge of 
being in the groove and I'm very excited to be in the position I'm in," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He has been in somewhat of a groove all summer, winning the Western Open and 
tying for second in the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
British Open Notes 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer finished last in the field after two rounds. He was at 164 with 
82s Thursday and Friday. Jack Nicklaus was still around, however. He made the 
cut at 145 after a 71 Friday. . . . Lee Trevino, who was two strokes out of the 
lead Thursday, shot a 73 Friday. "I have to shoot a good score tomorrow, 
praying for a lot of wind," Trevino said. "When you are that far behind, you 
have to have some bad weather to try to make a move." . . . Australia's Wayne 
Grady, the second-day leader, when asked where he comes from: "Didn't your 
mother ever tell you?"

ANOTHER EASY ONE FOR TYSON; 
</P>
<P>
THE TRUTH HURTS AS BOUT IS STOPPED AFTER 93 SECONDS 
</P>

<P>
Mike Tyson stopped challenger Carl (the Truth) Williams Friday night in a 
93-second heavyweight championship fight that ended in a torrent of boos and 
jeers from the crowd of 11,112 at Atlantic City's Convention Hall. 
</P>
<P>
After Tyson decked Williams with a left hook to the jaw, Williams arose at the 
count of six. The referee, former boxer Randy Neumann, could be seen speaking 
to Williams, who had briefly closed his eyes after rising. 
</P>
<P>
Then Neumann waved his arms, signaling the end of the fight. Howls of protest 
began rolling down from the balcony of the cavernous Convention Hall, but 
howling loudest were Williams and his trainer, Carmine Graziano. Graziano said 
that Neumann "choked." 
</P>
<P>
Crowds in Atlantic City are getting tired of one-round heavyweight title 
fights. In June of 1988, in the same building, Tyson knocked out Michael Spinks 
in 1:31. 
</P>
<P>
After Friday night's bout, a defiant Tyson and promoter Don King met the media. 
King handed $100,000 in cash to the champion, and Tyson flipped the two bundles 
to his cornermen. "I told Mike before the fight tonight that I'd give him 
$100,000 for every knockout," King said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a knockout, but no one much cared. 
</P>
<P>
What most wanted to hear was Neumann's explanation of why he stopped the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Neumann said he feared Tyson's left hook had given Williams a concussion. Only 
he, Neumann said, was looking into Williams' eyes -- and he didn't like what he 
saw. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, many thought Williams was able to continue, although at that point 
his chances of winning the fight appeared hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a 10-second judgment to make, and he (Williams) could not answer a very 
simple question. That, plus the look in his eyes, told me he was not in very 
good shape," said Neumann, a former heavyweight who is now a New Jersey family 
financial planner. Tyson-Williams was his 12th world title fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he was holding his hands up, but I was looking for more of a response 
than that. He closed his eyes for a couple of seconds, and then I got a blank 
stare. I asked him, 'Are you all right?' and didn't get an answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I had 38 fights, I'd been there, too. When you get up from a knockdown, you 
gotta be ready to fight, not just be an erect target. Most fighters will go out 
of their way to show you they're ready to continue. He didn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Neumann was asked if he would have stopped the fight under similar 
circumstances if it had been Tyson who had been down. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him 'Are you OK?' twice, the first time he gave me a long blink, the 
lids came up . . . and there were barren eyes behind them." 
</P>
<P>
Williams came out gunning for Tyson. He didn't retreat from the champion's 
explosive charges, but he was using his left forearm in close to hold Tyson's 
head down. Neumann warned him about holding in the first minute. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson seemed more under control this time than he was in his five-round victory 
over Frank Bruno last February in Las Vegas. Gone this time were the wild, 
leaping punches. This time, working inside, he unloaded crisp, powerful blows 
on his 6-foot-4 opponent. About a half-minute before the end, he hurt Williams 
with a right hand to the ribs. 
</P>
<P>
The finisher was half-hook, half-uppercut. It came from down low and caught 
Williams squarely on the chin. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned, sure," an angry Williams said later. "I wasn't hurt, though. I 
wasn't wobbling all over. I was standing up straight, ready to fight. This is a 
heavyweight championship fight, a guy goes down and you stop the fight? Excuse 
me? What is this, a one-knockdown state? 
</P>
<P>
"Something really funny was going on with this fight," he said. "This is 
business, right? You know the plays, you know the game." 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the fury surrounding Neumann was Tyson's readiness to fight his most 
prominent challenger, unbeaten Evander Holyfield, who watched from ringside. 
When Holyfield's name came up during the news conference, Tyson almost sneered. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I tell you somethin'?" he said. "I would love to fight Evander Holyfield. 
Right now, tonight. How about if we go down in the cellar right now, and the 
one who comes back up the stairs with the key is the champion?" 
</P>
<P>
Tyson described the fight-ending punch as "not that hard," denounced writers 
who'd reported "that my head was all . . . up," and said he still considered 
Muhammad Ali "the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
But King, who calls the shots in the 23-year-old champion's life, was being coy 
about the Tyson-Holyfield matchup, expected for early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We're considering a number of opponents for Mike," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a negotiating ploy, most believe. King wants a promotional option or two 
on Holyfield, in the event he wins, and Holyfield's manager, Ken Sanders, said 
Friday he wouldn't let King have one. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who earned $4 million Friday (Williams got $1 million), improved to 37-0 
in his quest for Rocky Marciano's record of 49-0. It was his 17th first-round 
victory. Williams is 22-3.

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL ATHLETES GET MARCHING ORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine the problem facing the U.S. Olympic Committee and organizers of the 
U.S. Olympic Festival who were planning Friday night's opening ceremonies held 
at the University of Oklahoma: How to cajole more than 3,500 athletes into 
behaving themselves in front of a national television audience -- and former 
President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight previous multi-sport Olympic Festivals, this one in Oklahoma is 
the first to have such a concern. Because of criticism regarding the manner in 
which the American team marched into Seoul Stadium during the opening 
ceremonies of the 1988 Olympic Games, USOC officials have been attempting to 
indoctrinate a new generation of athletes in proper marching technique. 
Starting here Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Seoul gaffe, captured in detail by television and beamed around the world, 
still embarrasses some U.S. officials. What the world saw was American athletes 
wearing Mickey Mouse caps, carrying "Hi, Mom" signs, breaking rank and running 
off the track and even going into the stands. Worse, as the delegation grew 
ever more ragged, it caused a traffic jam among other nations marching in. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was not unlike American entrances at other Olympics. What many in 
the U.S. delegation regarded as exuberant, youthful behavior was seen by many 
in the Olympic family as a display of boorish manners. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply had no idea," said one USOC official here of the world reaction to 
the Seoul spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
They found out soon enough, though. An official in the International Olympic 
Committee wrote an angry letter to the USOC delegation. The letter suggested 
that the Americans' rowdy display had offended their Korean hosts. 
</P>
<P>
The USOC got the message. Starting here, American athletes are being taught to 
behave themselves while marching. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday night's ceremonies these young athletes, most of whom have not 
competed internationally, were given a warning regarding what one official 
called "horsing around." 
</P>
<P>
The suspense was over early. The East team emerged from the northwest tunnel 
and strolled around the perimeter of the field in a peppy but orderly fashion. 
In fact, the East team's officials were in more ragged formation than the 
athletes, a scene that held true as all four regions marched in to a medley of 
tunes by John Phillip Sousa. 
</P>
<P>
While the official admonitions appeared to have reined in the athletes during 
the march into the stadium, little could be done to mollify bored athletes as 
they stood around the infield during the early portion of the evening's show. 
No lecture could have prevented the impromptu line dancing, handsprings and 
mugging for cameras. 
</P>
<P>
No one seemed to mind. After all, some allowances must be made for human 
nature. And youth. 
</P>
<P>
By festival standards, Friday night's show was the most glitzy and, quite 
probably, the most expensive. The crowd was the festival's largest ever for 
opening ceremonies, 76,014. Comedian Bob Hope was merely a warm-up for the main 
act, Reagan, who saluted the athletes and asked them to "Win one for the 
Gipper." 
</P>
<P>
Triple Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith Joyner carried the festival 
flame into Memorial Stadium, clad in her signature one-legged tights. 
</P>
<P>
As far as these football-field-as-stage extravaganzas go, this one lacked none 
of the standard gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Air Force jets buzzed the stadium. Skydivers carrying smoke devices landed 
on the 20-yard line. Hot air ballons. Fireworks. Laser light shows. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Oklahoma High School All-Star Band blared out songs that sought to 
"Salute Oklahoma's role in America's westward expansion." Which meant they 
played songs like the themes to TV's "Rawhide" and "Wild, Wild West". 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the act or whoever the star, the message never drifted far from 
evening's central theme -- Oklahoma. And those who have lived in it and still 
do and why. Famous Oklahomans such as James Garner, Patti Page, Mickey Mantle 
and Curt Gowdy were brought out to tremendous applause. Singers Roger Miller, 
Reba McEntire and the Oak Ridge Boys performed to tremendous applause. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, everything on the program was met with tremendous applause. 
</P>
<P>
The loudest applause was saved for the entrance of the South team, favorite 
sons here. In a remarkable development, the state's most favorite son was among 
those who escorted the South team. Former Oklahoma football coach Barry Switzer 
was introduced, and the crowd went wild. That was fanned when another celebrity 
escort, former Sooner running back Billy Sims, spontaneously grabbed Switzer in 
a bear hug. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer, who recently resigned while his football program continued to wilt 
under intense scrutiny from the National Collegiate Athletic Assn., walked 
quietly amid the tumult.

They met six years ago in a neighborhood gym in White Plains, N.Y., Mike Tyson, 
then a 16-year-old amateur boxer being nurtured by the late Cus D'Amato, and 
Carl (The Truth) Williams, 23, a promising professional heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
They would test each other's strength and courage three straight days, but now, 
not surprisingly, each remembers these learning experiences quite differently. 
</P>
<P>
"That first day, he came at me like I'd cursed his mother," said Williams, who 
challenges Tyson for his undisputed heavyweight title at the Convention Center 
on Friday night.

"We'd been told by D'Amato not to try to hurt his kid. That he was just a baby, 
getting his feet wet. But he tried to tear my head off and bloodied my nose. 
</P>
<P>
"I went home raging mad, and all I could think about was getting even," 
Williams added. "The next two days, I kicked some butt and D'Amato wouldn't let 
us near him again." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, on the other hand, remembers getting all the best of it and sending his 
older, more-seasoned rival into hiding. For public consumption, the champion, 
turned 23 and a granite-like 219 1/4 pounds, says, "They were real good 
workouts, but that was then, and this is now." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. While Tyson made a meteoric rise through the heavyweight ranks and 
solidified the title while stretching his unblemished record to 36-0, including 
32 knockouts, Williams (22-2, 17 K0s) has been on a treadmill since May 1985, 
when, as a decided underdog, came close to dethroning then-heavyweight champion 
Larry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
The prohibitive 12-1 odds indicate Williams is given even less of a chance than 
Tyson's last four title challengers -- Holmes, Tony Tubbs, Michael Spinks and 
Frank Bruno -- who lasted a combined 12 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams and his handlers insist that he will not be like these previous 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all heard it before," said Williams' trainer, Carmen Graziano. "A lot of 
guys have said that they were going to beat Tyson and then let him walk all 
over them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been associated with four champions, and Williams has a better jab than 
any of them. You only see it on the way back. You don't expect a guy 6-4 and 
218 pounds to be this fast. Tyson is quick, but my guy is quicker.

Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver rallied after losing the second set to beat her unseeded Canadian 
opponent, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.

Jonas Svensson and Mats Wilander gave Sweden a commanding 2-0 lead over 
Yugoslavia in their Davis Cup semifinal after both won singles matches Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, ranked fourth in the world, struggled before defeating Goran Prpic, 
7-6, 6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Svensson beat teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic, 6-4, 7-6, 3-6, 6-4, on the 
clay courts at this seaside resort. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden, trying to reach the final for the seventh consecutive year, has never 
lost a Davis Cup best-of-five competition after winning the first two singles. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of this semifinal will play the United States-West Germany winner. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Edberg, replaced by Svensson in singles after spraining his ankle last 
weekend, and Anders Jarryd will be heavily favored to wrap up the Swedish 
victory in today's doubles. 
</P>
<P>
The reverse singles are Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"This looks good. I've felt all the way that we would win this Davis Cup 
match," said John-Anders Sjogren, Sweden's captain and also Wilander's personal 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander saved a set point at 6-7 before winning the first-set tiebreaker, 9-7. 
Prpic lost the last point when he hit a forehand wide as the Swede was coming 
to the net. 
</P>
<P>
After the second set was tied, 1-1, Wilander won 11 consecutive games. Prpic 
had only one break point during that run, but Wilander saved it to go to 4-0 in 
the third set.

CURT BYRUM LEADS BY ONE AT COAL VALLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Curt Byrum, looking for his first victory in seven years on the PGA Tour, beat 
the wind and rain to finish with a three-under-par 67 Friday and take the 
second-round lead in the Hardee's golf tournament at Coal Valley, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Byrum finished just before a storm hit the Oakwood Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
The foul weather, a constant on the tour this year, caused play to be suspended 
for more than an hour in the late afternoon. Showers also delayed the start of 
the round for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Byrum's total of seven-under-par 133 put him a stroke ahead of defending 
champion Blaine McCallister and Greg Ladehoff. 
</P>
<P>
McCallister shot a 69, his sixth straight subpar round in this tournament, 
while Ladehoff had a 65. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Alcott just missed an eagle at the 18th hole, then settled for par, a 
four-under-par 68 and a share of the lead with Penny Hammel, Shirley Furlong 
and Cathy Marino after two rounds of the LPGA's Boston Five tournament at 
Danvers, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Hammel shot a 69, Furlong a 66 and Marino a 67. 
</P>
<P>
All were at eight-under-par 136, one stroke ahead of Beth Daniel and two ahead 
of Kathy Postlewait and Cindy Rarick. 
</P>
<P>
Alcott, seeking her 28th victory in 15 years on the tour but winless so far 
this year, had cleared a large pond and was about 30 yards from the cup in two 
shots on the 485-yard, par-five final hole. Her pitch hit the pin, then the cup 
but rolled about six feet away. She missed the putt that would have given her a 
one-stroke lead. 
</P>
<P>
Chick Evans, a last-minute entry, birdied six straight holes on the back nine 
for a six-under-par 66 and a share of the first-round lead with Dick Rhyan in 
the first Ameritech Senior Open at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Evans did not find out he was playing until Bob Goalby dropped out Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Former Masters champion Charles Coody and South African Harold Henning were one 
shot back at 67, while Larry Mowry, 1964 PGA champion Bobby Nichols and Jimmy 
Powell were at 68.

The top Raider rookie, Penn State guard Steve Wisniewski, agreed to terms 
Friday and reported after a one-day holdout. 
</P>
<P>
Wisniewski was the top pick in the second round. Of the players selected ahead 
of him in the draft, only two have signed -- Troy Aikman with Dallas, and Andre 
Rison with Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
George Karras, who handled negotiations for the Raiders, did so from a hospital 
bed, after undergoing foot surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Wisniewski is thought to be in the running for the starting right guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Emanuel King, a free agent from Cincinnati, hurt his right shoulder 
in the morning drill Friday. X-rays were negative and it is thought to be a 
bruise. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Wilson, the free agent from Chicago who is coming off knee surgery, is 
working out without pads. Said Raider Coach Mike Shanahan: "He's not 100% at 
this time. We want to build his conditioning level up. When we think he's 
ready, we'll put him in pads." MARK HEISLER

LINEBACKING CORPS ON THIS TEAM IS AN ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's an old saying in football that you can never have enough linebackers. 
Or is that an old baseball saying about pitchers? 
</P>
<P>
Whichever, the Rams have enough linebackers to start a dance troupe. They 
opened training camp with 17 on the roster, about a dozen more than you might 
use on a given day. 
</P>
<P>
If they needed anything on draft day it was inside help, because of the loss of 
veterans Carl Ekern (retirement), Jim Collins (free agency) and possibly Mark 
Jerue (knee surgery). 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams passed on inside linebacker Keith DeLong in the first round and 
drafted two more outside rushers in the second -- Notre Dame's Frank Stams and 
Auburn's Brian Smith. Sticking to their theme, they took another outside 
linebacker, George Bethune, in the seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
It all sounds a bit crazy, though the Rams claim to know what they're doing. 
Last year they unveiled something called the Eagle defense, a five-linebacker 
scheme that featured only two down linemen. They gave up bulk for quickness and 
rushed the opposing quarterback in waves, leading the league with 56 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Smith and Stams, when he eventually signs, will give the 
defense even more versatility. The plan is to attack an opponent with even more 
multiple shifts of youthful faces. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson said the team might keep 10 linebackers on the 47-man 
roster, which should provide a pretty good fight for playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about that now," Robinson said. "I'm worried about getting the 
best guys playing." 
</P>
<P>
Here's an early handicap in order of job security: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kevin Greene. The Eagle defense made him a star last season. He finished 
with 16 1/2 sacks, second in the National Football League only to Reggie White. 
Here's the difference: White is demanding in excess of $7 million to play in 
Philadelphia the next five seasons. Greene will earn $250,000 this year, 
subject to renegotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mel Owens. The nine-year veteran was off to his best start last year before 
suffering an ankle sprain that forced him out of the last nine games. Owens has 
been asked to play some inside linebacker this year because of the lack of 
depth at the position. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't switched positions, it's just additional responsibilities," Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Wilcher. The Rams would love for him to return to the form of 1985, 
when he had 12 1/2 sacks. He fell to 7 1/2 sacks last season, but remains a 
load of talent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Larry Kelm. He takes over for Carl Ekern at inside linebacker and calls the 
signals on defense. He has been groomed for three years for this job. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fred Strickland. The second-year man from Purdue takes over the other 
inside spot for Jim Collins/Mark Jerue. Robinson thinks Strickland could soon 
be one of the great players in the league. Strickland capped his rookie season 
with 13 tackles and four sacks in his final two games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frank Stams/Brian Smith. These rookies are safe because teams don't cut 
second-round draft choices. Smith is 6-foot-6 and already swatting down passes 
in practice. Stams remains a holdout. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brett Faryniarz. He made the team as a free agent last season, but the line 
at outside linebacker forms at the rear. He'll need another great training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mark Jerue. With two good knees, Jerue would be near the top of the list. 
But he's fighting off another arthroscopic surgery and is trying to make one 
last charge in August. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Byron Darby. He signed as an unprotected free agent in the off-season after 
spending the last two years with Indianapolis. He's a versatile veteran who can 
also play a little nose tackle. That helps his chances. The sprained ankle that 
will keep him out a week or so does not. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Davis. He also signed as an unprotected free agent and can play Mel 
Owens' spot over the tight end in the Eagle defense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- George Bethune. The seventh-round choice from Alabama is impressing coaches 
in camp. His problem? He's an outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mark Messner. An interesting project who's being looked at in Jerue's 
roving linebacker/nose-tackle position. Messner lacks the size of a down 
lineman and speed for a linebacker but finished with 71 tackles at Michigan 
last season. He doesn't do anything real well except play football.

P&amp;G LOSES DIAPER DUEL WITH KIMBERLY-CLARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<P>
A federal judge has ruled against Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in a patent dispute 
with Kimberly-Clark Corp., defeating the consumer products giant's bid for 
control of the $3-billion disposable-diaper market. 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble had charged that the Dallas-based manufacturer of 
"super-absorbent" Huggies diapers had copied Procter &amp; Gamble's design of 
"super-absorbent" Pampers. 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, was seeking removal of Huggies from 
store shelves and unspecified monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins ruled Thursday that a Procter &amp; 
Gamble patent for its diaper is unenforceable because the company intended to 
deceive a patent examiner. 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman Carol Boyd said the company plans to appeal 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble is the leader in the disposable-diaper industry, with 47% 
of the market. Kimberly-Clark is No. 2, with about 30% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the lawsuit was a Procter &amp; Gamble patent to combine wood 
pulp fluff and super-absorbent material to produce a thinner diaper. 
</P>
<P>
After the application was rejected several times, Procter &amp; Gamble was 
awarded a patent in 1985 based on new test data that convinced a patent 
examiner that the development was unique, the ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
But Hawkins said Procter &amp; Gamble did not provide the U.S. Patent Office 
with results of 1983 tests challenging the 1985 data and that the attorney 
handling the matter was "grossly negligent" for failing to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"The finding of intent to deceive is bolstered by the highly material nature of 
the false affidavit," the judge said in his 58-page ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble attorneys argued during the 17-day, non-jury trial that 
the firm lost $300 million a year because of the alleged patent infringement by 
Kimberly-Clark. The trial ended May 31. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins also ruled that an antitrust complaint filed by Kimberly-Clark against 
Procter &amp; Gamble in a separate lawsuit may proceed. That case is expected 
to go to trial in Charleston early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly-Clark operates a diaper plant in South Carolina.

CALFED'S CHIEF QUITS AT REQUEST OF THE DIRECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John R. Torell III quit Friday as chairman, president and chief executive of 
CalFed Inc., the parent of California Federal Bank, two days after the Los 
Angeles thrift's board of directors asked for his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Torell headed CalFed just short of one year, joining the company last Aug. 1 
after 27 years as an executive with Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in New York. 
Torell effectively will be replaced by Jerry St. Dennis, most recently the 
company's chief financial officer and chief economist. St. Dennis' title will 
be president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, director Arthur W. Schmutz was named chairman and a three-member 
"Office of the Chairman" was formed that includes Schmutz and directors Howard 
P. Allen and Richard C. Lawton. With $28.3 billion in total assets, CalFed is 
the nation's fourth-largest thrift. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Friday, Torell, who said the board asked for his 
resignation Wednesday, said his differences with CalFed directors did not stem 
from disagreements over his policies, which included an overhaul of much of 
CalFed's operations. Rather, he said, the differences were that CalFed's 
directors believed "that West Coast thrift culture is different than the 
culture that I brought." 
</P>
<P>
Torell declined to specify those differences. But thrift executives and 
industry analysts said CalFed had trouble adapting to Torell, an intense, often 
impatient man. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tough-guy way about him," said Peter Treadway, an analyst who 
follows the company for the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham. 
</P>
<P>
As a former New York banker, Torell came from a much more formal corporate 
environment than is found at CalFed. Torell, for example, asked executives to 
wear their suit jackets when walking around the company building and office. He 
also made it known that he wanted to end CalFed's annual meeting with 
shareholders quickly this year. The meeting took less than 20 minutes, compared 
to more than an hour in past years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Each Other 
</P>
<P>
CalFed directors and St. Dennis did not return a reporter's calls Friday. 
Despite being fired by CalFed's directors, Torell praised them as a "neat 
board" that he respects. 
</P>
<P>
"We like each other just fine," Torell said.

Torell joined CalFed soon after quitting as president of Manufacturers Hanover, 
where he had been viewed as the eventual successor to John McGillicuddy as 
chief executive. Torell said then that he left because of a growing frustration 
that he would not lead a big bank soon. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, that drive to run things was a factor earlier this year when CalFed was 
in merger talks with GlenFed, the parent of Glendale Federal Bank -- a 
combination that would have created the nation's largest thrift. 
</P>
<P>
But the talks broke off, in part because of disagreements between Torell and 
GlenFed Chairman Norman M. Coulson over who would be head of the merged 
institution. Some analysts speculated Friday that Torell's leaving may result 
in the renewal of those talks, although executives familiar with the 
discussions said they believe that they are off for now. 
</P>
<P>
Torell came to CalFed looking for a turnaround situation and got one in a 
company whose earnings had lagged and that had diversified into far-flung 
areas. Among his actions were to dispose of some insurance businesses and part 
of its trust operation and to sell a $500-million loan portfolio. He also set 
CalFed on a course of expanding its branch system and buying other savings and 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Squeeze on Capital 
</P>
<P>
Despite the changes that Torell made, CalFed has problems. It has some $566 
million in intangible assets called goodwill that it will not be able to 
consider as capital under new, tougher standards about to be approved as part 
of the nation's savings and loan bailout package. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one expects CalFed to have difficulty meeting the minimum 
requirements that will be set, some industry analysts and thrift executives 
believe that it may not have adequate capital to grow and buy choice thrifts 
that come up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The news of Torell's resignation came one day after CalFed reported a 50% drop 
in earnings to $19 million in the second quarter. The decline was due largely 
to lower profit in its financial services segment, caused by higher short-term 
borrowing costs.

WHISTLE-BLOWER SAYS MCDONNELL SEEKS TO SETTLE SUIT 
</P>

McDonnell Douglas is preparing to settle for several hundred thousand dollars a 
civil lawsuit alleging that the firm overcharged the Army for attack 
helicopters, according to Rod Stillwell, the plaintiff in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Stillwell, a former subcontracts administrator at McDonnell Douglas Helicopter 
Co., sued the firm in 1987 under the federal False Claims Act. Stillwell 
alleged that the company had overcharged the Army by $1.1 million on 
subcontracts for the Apache attack helicopter. He later amended the case and 
raised the alleged damages to $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell officials declined to comment on whether the firm is negotiating to 
settle with Stillwell. McDonnell lost an effort in the Stillwell case earlier 
this year to have the False Claims Act declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"McDonnell currently is pursuing pretrial appeals, one having to do with the 
retroactive application of the 1986 changes in the law and the second one being 
the constitutionality of the changes," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All Major Issues Resolved 
</P>
<P>
William Ramsey, Stillwell's Encino attorney, confirmed that he is negotiating 
to settle the case, but declined to discuss specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Stillwell said McDonnell has agreed to pay nearly a half million dollars and 
that all major issues have been resolved. The Justice Department is reviewing 
the settlement, because the government must consent to dismissal under the law. 
</P>
<P>
The False Claims Act gives the government the right to join the case as a 
plaintiff and share in the recovery. The Justice Department last year agreed to 
join the case and later withdrew, saying it could not establish that the 
government had been injured. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department official acknowledged that it is reviewing a proposed 
settlement in the case but that no decision has been reached. Under the 
proposed settlement, the cash damages would go to Stillwell, and McDonnell 
would not charge the government for certain of its legal expenses, according to 
Stillwell.

IRAN PAYS FLUOR $43 MILLION TO SETTLE DISPUTE; 
</P>
<P>
PAYMENT OPENS DOOR FOR IRVINE FIRM TO REBUILD OIL REFINERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fluor Corp. said Friday that it has received about $43 million in a settlement 
with the National Iranian Oil Co. for unpaid bills on a refinery construction 
job interrupted in 1979 by the revolution in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Potentially more important than the cash that Fluor received, industry analysts 
say, is that the settlement opens the way for Fluor to re-establish business in 
Iran, once a major Fluor customer and now eager to rebuild and renovate the gas 
and oil processing facilities ravaged in its war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Federal policy bars U.S. companies from doing business in or with Iran, but 
James Rollans, vice president of communications for the Irvine-based 
engineering and construction corporation, said that if that policy changes, the 
settlement would open the door for Fluor. 
</P>
<P>
Rollans said: "Over the last two years there have been a number of telephone 
calls from the National Iranian Oil Co. asking us to consider coming back and 
helping them with the reconstruction of some of the refineries that were 
damaged from the war and to upgrade older refineries." 
</P>
<P>
But Rollans said the company refused even to consider a new project in Iran 
until its prior claims were settled. "Now the door is open to see what they 
have specifically in mind and if it makes business sense for us to bid on a 
project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations Intensified 
</P>
<P>
Rollans said that when the Iranian revolution broke out Fluor had worked in 
Iran for 18 years and was the largest oil and gas processing plant builder in 
the country. He said Fluor had nearly completed a $750-million gas refinery 
project in the central Iranian city of Esfahan, about 150 miles south of 
Tehran, and was waiting for the last installment payment when the 
government-owned National Iranian Oil Co. stopped paying its bills in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Rollans said, Fluor filed a claim with the Iran U.S. Claims Tribunal, 
a special panel established at the Hague in the Netherlands to sort out claims 
and counterclaims between Iran and its foreign contractors. He said 
negotiations over Fluor's claim had intensified in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
As a condition of the settlement, Rollans said, Fluor agreed not to discuss the 
size of its original claim, which he said included "more than the direct costs 
involved," such as interest, damages and unpaid insurance losses. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can say is that we understand this settlement is roughly in 
line with the percentage of overall claims that U.S companies are receiving. 
They (Iran) have been fairly consistent in the awards," Rollans said. 
</P>
<P>
After taxes and other costs have been deducted, the settlement is expected to 
give Fluor a gain in its third fiscal quarter of about $8 million, or 10 cents 
a share. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Altman, engineering and construction analyst for Paine Webber Inc. in New 
York, said: "The $43 million is not material, overall" to Fluor's financial 
health because of the very large and expanding scope of the company's business 
and because the company long ago had written off the claims against Iran as a 
total loss. 
</P>
<P>
Altman said the most positive outcome of the settlement is the opportunity for 
Fluor to re-establish a business relationship with Iran.

COURT UPHOLDS $5.8-MILLION FINE FOR UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appeals court Friday upheld a $5.8-million verdict against a 
Pomona-based union local sued by two men who claim that the union illegally 
forced their Chino grocery store out of business during a 1975 strike. 
</P>
<P>
The award, made in 1987 by a Pomona Superior Court jury against a local of the 
Retail Clerks Union, now the United Food and Commercial Workers, attracted 
widespread attention in 1987 when the local filed for protection from creditors 
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The filing was made after the two men, Peter Vargas 
of Walnut and Kenneth Henderson of Chino, moved to attach the union's assets. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas and Henderson sued after closing their Chino Farms Market.

FIRMS GET BOOST IN GAS PIPELINE RACE TO STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The race to build a natural gas pipeline to California heated up Friday when 
Southern California Gas Co. announced an agreement to buy gas from the Altamont 
pipeline project, which would bring gas from Canada to Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Kern River Gas Transmission Co., which is proposing its 
own pipeline from Wyoming to California, said it had agreed to transport 
Altamont's gas on the final leg of its journey south. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements gave a boost to Altamont and Kern in their competition with a 
rival pipeline project of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. of San Francisco, 
which also proposes to transport the cheap Canadian gas desired by many local 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Kern's agreement with Altamont also is an apparent setback for the competing 
Wy-Cal Pipeline project, which would follow a route nearly identical to Kern's. 
</P>
<P>
All of the projects are competing with several others for federal permission, 
customers and financing to begin construction and ultimately win a share of the 
expected strong market for natural gas here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revives Interest 
</P>
<P>
Altamont also announced Friday that it had applied for federal permission to 
proceed with the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure whether (Altamont) could be a viable project," said Richard 
Bilas, a member of the California Energy Commission. "It certainly revives 
interest in Altamont project and shows that someone else is thinking about 
bringing in Canadian gas other than through the (PG&amp;E) system." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Gas said it would contract for 200 million cubic feet per 
day of Canadian gas through the Altamont line, a $580-million, 620-mile pipe 
from Wild Horse, Alberta, Canada, to Opal, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
At Opal, Altamont would connect with the proposed Kern River pipeline, a 
762-mile $750-million line that would bring the gas to California and gas 
company pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements followed by a month separate deals between Kern River and the 
Mojave Pipeline Co. to merge their pipelines at Barstow. SoCal Gas has 
previously contracted with Kern River for 150 million cubic feet per day of 
natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
The combined projects would afford Southern California Gas access to natural 
gas from Canada, Wyoming, Kern County and the Southwest, said gas company 
Senior Vice President Frederick E. John. 
</P>
<P>
Altamont is sponsored by Petro-Canada Inc., Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. Ltd. and 
Shell Canada Ltd. Kern River is a joint venture of units of Tenneco Inc. of 
Houston and the Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: TOO-PERFECT MAIL OFFERS SHOULD RAISE RED FLAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It sounded too good to be true. And it was. 
</P>
<P>
Postcards proclaiming, "You Are a Winner," sent to hundreds of thousands of 
consumers nationwide, told them that a Marina del Rey yacht club had awarded 
each of them a "sportster runabout outboard motorboat." All the lucky winners 
needed to do was send $165.17 to cover shipping and handling charges. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of getting a seagoing motorboat, recipients got a cheap, inflatable 
rubber raft. The yacht club was fictitious. The fraud's perpetrator, William 
Melville Harris of Los Angeles, was charged with false representation and 
agreed in a settlement to refund $500,000 to 4,000 victims. 
</P>
<P>
Free-prize scams like Harris' are among the most common variations of a growing 
problem of mail-marketing fraud. Pitching anything from free vacations to 
miracle health cures, unscrupulous operators are fleecing victims of hundreds 
of millions of dollars each year. Often, the goods are never delivered or are 
blatantly misrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
Mail-fraud scamsters also use telemarketing to make their pitches, as greater 
sales pressure can be applied to potential victims over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"As a general rule, mail fraud is more of a problem today," says Donald 
Obritsch, an inspector in the Postal Inspection Service's regional office in 
Pasadena, which is investigating several hundred mail-fraud cases in the 
Southern California area. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, local, state and federal authorities have been moving aggressively 
against such scamsters. Last year alone, some 1,488 arrests and 1,015 
convictions were obtained against mail-scam operators nationwide, Obritsch 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California judges also are handing out stiff sentences of as much as 
25 years in prison and are ordering restitution awards amounting to millions of 
dollars, says Terree A. Bowers, chief of the major fraud unit at the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But despite such efforts, scams will continue until consumers know enough to 
spot them and avoid getting ripped off. Mail fraud has many variations, but 
among the most common are: 
</P>
<P>
* Free-prize scams. They are probably the most popular fraud scheme, Obritsch 
says. They usually come as mailings that offer prizes ranging from television 
sets to recreational vehicles to burglar alarms. To win the prizes, however, 
you may be required to buy a product such as a water purification system, or 
visit a faraway resort offering vacation time-shares, or send a check to cover 
postage and handling. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, however, the product you buy is either inflated in value, poor in 
quality or not much in demand. The same is usually true of the prize. "Finely 
carved" grandfather clocks offered as prizes may turn out to be flimsy wooden 
boxes with cheap battery-operated timepieces. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes you may be required to donate money to a charity in exchange for a 
prize. But the charity may be fictitious, or it may never receive your money. 
</P>
<P>
In one recent case, a Southern California company told customers that part of 
the money they spent buying high-quality pens and key chains would go to the 
Statue of Liberty fund. Instead, none of the money did, and the pens and key 
chains were worth far less than advertised. Customers also were told they had 
won fishing and hunting boats but instead got cheap rubber rafts. The 
perpetrator of the fraud was sentenced to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
* Free-vacation schemes. These usually promise a free vacation in an exotic 
location. The rub is that you must cough up money to join a travel club, or buy 
a second airline ticket. The total cost may be greater than if you simply 
bought the ticket from a legitimate travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
* Merchandise frauds. These frauds simply sell products that are grossly 
overvalued or misrepresented. Examples include $59.95 "professional tool kits" 
that turn out to be cheap pieces worth 95 cents. Or $4.95 "bronze and copper 
busts of President Lincoln" that instead are single Lincoln pennies. Or $3.50 
"handy paint mixers" that end up being 10-cent wooden sticks. 
</P>
<P>
* Health frauds. These include pitches for medical products that don't perform 
as claimed or may not have been tested. In some cases they may even be 
dangerous to your health. 
</P>
<P>
Examples of such frauds, Obritsch says, include pitches for special teas 
promising to lower cholesterol. Or "Fat Magnet" weight-loss pills promising to 
attract and flush fat out of your body. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all mail pitches are bogus. There are many legitimate mail-order 
firms selling decent products. How do you tell the difference? 
</P>
<P>
First, use common sense. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If a 
pitch says you've won a free prize, but then asks you to send money to claim 
it, throw it away. And be aware that pitches offering you free prizes as an 
inducement to look at a distant condominium complex or buy a new product may be 
touting items that may be overvalued or of poor quality. 
</P>
<P>
Second, investigate. Get a phone number for the marketer. Call and ask 
questions about the products or prizes. If it's a scam, "nine times out of 10, 
you will not find their phone numbers listed," Obritsch says. 
</P>
<P>
Other steps to protect yourself: Consider paying by credit card. Under the Fair 
Credit Billing Act, you have up to 60 days from the time you're billed to 
contest a charge on grounds that the product was misrepresented. But don't give 
your credit card number over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Also, keep good records. Keep copies of the original solicitation, advertising 
materials, receipts. Take notes of phone conversations. This will help if you 
take formal action against the rip-off artists. 
</P>
<P>
If you didn't get what was advertised, ask for your money back. Some victims 
also have sued successfully. 
</P>
<P>
If these actions don't work, file a complaint. Otherwise, authorities may not 
have any record that you were victimized and thus may not get you restitution 
if action is taken against the fraudulent operation. 
</P>
<P>

and Ventura counties, call the Postal Inspection Service at (800) 847-8847. In 
San Diego, call (619) 233-0610. Or write: Postal Inspection Service, P.O. Box

SOARING SKY-HIGH FOR AIR SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
AIRPLANE EXHIBITS, FLYING AWARDS WILL BE OFFERED AT AVIATION EXPO '89 AT VAN 
NUYS AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Here's what this weekend offers: formation flying, fly-overs and the 
opportunity to see at close range both the latest in military aircraft as well 
as venerable World War II war birds. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the romance of an air show. And if you've been smitten with the Blue Lady 
of the Sky, what better place to rendezvous than at Aviation Expo '89 at the 
Van Nuys Airport this weekend? 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Greater Van Nuys Area Chamber of Commerce, this free event, 
scheduled for today and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., will feature 
demonstration flying, entertainment, tours of the airport, celebrities and 
static displays. 
</P>
<P>
Attracted by the technological power and sheer beauty of flight, millions of 
spectators flock to air shows each year. Many seem to share the sentiments of 
author ("Sympathy for the Devil") and air-show devotee Kent Anderson. "These 
performances give people an opportunity to experience flying with a certain 
immediacy not available to them on films or TV," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, this type of spectacle flying began in the late '20s when 
competitive races were held at Mines Field -- at that time open agricultural 
land -- which has developed into today's Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In 1929, Bobbi Trout, flying the Golden Eagle monoplane built by an Inglewood 
manufacturer, set an endurance record of more than 12 hours in the air. Trout 
landed at Metropolitan Airport, later renamed Van Nuys Airport, the busiest 
general-aviation facility in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
About as much emphasis will be necessary for automobile-traffic control as 
air-traffic control this weekend, when an expected attendance of more than 
100,000 people arrive for the Van Nuys show, which is themed "Aces in 
Aviation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bow to Contributors 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to honor the men and women who have made major contributions to 
flight, including pilots, engineers, designers and war aces," said Bob Hayes, 
airport public-relations director. 
</P>
<P>
The awards program will take place today and Sunday at 1:30 p.m. in the staging 
area. Among those to be honored are Bobbi Trout, who competed with Amelia 
Earhart in the late '20s to set distance and endurance records; she will 
receive the historical-achievement award. 
</P>
<P>
Among others slated for awards are John J. Fling, World War II radar engineer 
for Gilfillan Bros. Inc. (now ITT Gilfillan), and retired Air Force pilot Bill 
Anderson, who flew 200 Berlin Airlift missions. Astronaut Kathy Sullivan will 
receive a special-achievement award. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley chapter of the Ninety-Nines, an international 
organization of women pilots, will receive a community-service award. Col. 
William (Pete) Knight, X-15 test pilot and former vice commander of the Air 
Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, will receive a 
special-achievement award. United Airlines pilot Clay Lacy, who was aerial 
photographer for "Top Gun" and other films and set a round-the-world speed 
record with a Boeing 747, will receive recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ritchie, a Vietnam Air Force flying ace, will receive an award, as will 
Lt. Lori Melling, a Navy test pilot who is among a select group of women 
assigned to tactical fighter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Special awards will go to Bud Whalen for flight instruction; Allen Paulson, 
board chairman of Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., for general aviation 
contributions, and Norm Norton, air-traffic control supervisor at Van Nuys 
Airport, for air traffic-control achievement. 
</P>
<P>
The flying demonstrations will begin at 2:30 p.m. both days when an A-10 
Thunderbolt team, led by Capt. Jack King from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in 
Arizona, will perform. A squadron of fast-diminishing World War II P-51 
Mustangs will go through their paces, while sturdy C-130s, flown by the 
California Air National Guard, will perform flybys. 
</P>

<P>
'Limited Spectacle Flying' 
</P>
<P>
Because of the heavily populated area, Hayes said, "we plan limited spectacle 
flying." Expo '89, however, will feature more than 50 military planes in static 
display, including the F-14 Tomcats, the fighter plane featured in "Top Gun," 
and other high-tech aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Among the planes to be viewed, and, in some instances, whose capabilities will 
be explained by pilots and volunteers, will be the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the 
EA-7 Corsair from Pt. Mugu Naval Air Station, the KC-10 from March Air Force 
Base, the P-3 Orion, several attack helicopters, the B-1 bomber and a number of 
vintage aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
In the vintage-aircraft area, Bill Rheinschild, a pilot active in the 
Confederate Air Force, a Texas-based group that restores and flies World War II 
aircraft, will exhibit his P-51 Mustang, a T-28, T-33 and T-6. Winner of an 
award at the Reno Air Races this year for his Mustang "Risky Business," 
Rheinschild considers the P-51 a "wonderful craft to fly. It made long-range 
bombing possible and turned the tide of the war," he said. "One reason pilots 
participate in air shows is to demonstrate and explain their planes in an 
effort to further interest in aviation and help young people think about 
careers." 
</P>
<P>
"We also want people who served (in the military) to know their efforts aren't 
forgotten," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Guilford, chief pilot for the recently opened Museum of Flying in Santa 
Monica and founder of the EAA-Warbirds of America (an international 
organization to preserve antique craft), plans to exhibit several of his own 
planes: an A-1 Skyraider, an attack fighter used in Korea and Vietnam, and an 
A-26 Invader, which, Guilford reports, was the only U.S. bomber to see action 
in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. He also will display, and if possible fly, 
his British-built, Supermarine Spitfire Mk XIV. 
</P>
<P>
Entry and parking for this weekend's show are free. Enter at 8030 Balboa Blvd. 
at the California Air National Guard sign. Call for information (818) 908-5965. 
Sixteen organizations, from aeronautical clubs to service groups, will sell 
food and run concession booths. Proceeds will be donated to various civic 
groups and charities in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Other air shows are scheduled during the year throughout Southern California. 
Among them are: 
</P>
<P>
Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego has scheduled its show Aug. 12 and 13. 
The Navy's Blue Angels will perform, as will the Army's Golden Knights 
parachute team. Aircraft on display will range from World War II fighters to 
current strategic bombers. In its 40th year, this is considered a major 
military show. Follow Interstate 5 to the 805; take Miramar Road east to the 
entrance. Free admission. Information: (619) 537-4082. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards Air Force Base will have open house, Oct. 29, 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Nearly half 
a million people have been attracted to this Air Force base and NASA research 
facility in past years to see such experimental aircraft as the SR-71 Blackbird 
(a high-altitude reconnaissance jet) and a U-2 spy plane. This year, planes in 
the developmental stage will include the X-29 and the X-15 Eagle (modified for 
short take-off and landing). Also on display will be modified F-16 fighters and 
the B-1B. There also will be a number of restored antique aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m., the Air Force Thunderbirds, first launched as a demonstration team 
in 1953, will perform. 
</P>
<P>
From Interstate 5, take California 14. Look for Edwards AFB exit sign 11 miles 
north of Lancaster. Free admission. 
</P>
<P>
Pt. Mugu Naval Air Station has scheduled its annual show the weekend of Oct. 
28-29. The Thunderbirds are scheduled only for Oct. 29, but stunt flying, such 
as wing-walking and jet "dragster" racing, will be offered Oct. 28. At past 
shows, ground displays have featured a number of heavy-duty helicopters, many 
open for inspection. Because it's also the home of the Pacific Missile Test 
Center, Pt. Mugu is a good place to see models of advanced missiles and 
aircraft manufactured by such contractors as General Dynamics and Northrop. The 
air station is three miles south of Oxnard on Pacific Coast Highway. Free 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Aviation Air Show is scheduled for Nov. 11-12 at 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport, 3000 N. Clybourn Ave. in Burbank. The show 
will feature planes of the past, such as the Ford Tri-Motor, DC-2, Lockheed 
Constellation and Lockheed Electra; as well as planes of the future. Admission: 
$5; parking $2. 
</P>
<P>
Chino Municipal Airport is the site of an annual show that features planes on 
the endangered-species list, many from Chino's own Planes of Fame Museum. The 
shows are scheduled the third weekend in May. 
</P>
<P>
This year, using 20 craft from the museum and others that were flown in, pilots 
demonstrated mint-condition P-51 Mustangs, the F-4U Corsair, P-40, P-47 
Thunderbolt and B-17 Flying Fortress. Howard Wilson, the museum's general 
manager, says the high point was unique formation flying by a German 
Messerschmitt, British Spitfire, American Mustang and Japanese Zero. 
</P>
<P>
From Los Angeles, take the Pomona Freeway (California 60) through Pomona; turn 
south on Euclid Avenue to the airport. Air show is $10 for adults, $5 for 
children under 12. Entrance to the museum is $4.95; children under 12, $1.95. 
Call for group rates. Rides in vintage planes offered at museum for $300 
donation. Museum information: (714) 597-3722. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, Santa Ana (714) 726-2937. Show held each year 
in late April at home of the Third Marine Aircraft Wing. The last show featured 
skywriting teams and dogfight routines, plus a demonstration by the Marine 
Corps Air-Ground Task Force. From the Santa Ana Freeway, take Sand Canyon 
Avenue exit left to Trabuco Road. Turn right and drive 500 yards to the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 When attending an air show, it's a good idea to wear layered clothing to 
accommodate climate changes during a long day outdoors. Bring a lightweight 
folding chair (one with attached umbrella is especially useful). Sunscreen 
lotion is a must, especially for children, and don't forget sunglasses and 
binoculars. Parents of toddlers may want to bring strollers. You might want to 
keep a cooler of beverages in your car for an all-day expedition. If you're 
attending a show on a military base, be sure to fill up the gas tank before 
entering.

WILDLIFE -- UP CLOSE 'N' PERSONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE Z. COOKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time, oh best beloved, there was a summer school for all the wild 
animals of the field and forest, veldt and savanna, water hole and river 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The school was at the San Diego Wild Animal Park east of Escondido, where 250 
animal species, 47 of them endangered, roam over 700 spacious acres in the dry, 
sunny San Pasqual Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The summer school was for the birds -- and for the tigers, gorillas, 
wildebeests, rhinos and, yes, even for weak and puny man cubs. And for their 
parents, too. But at this school, the animals were the teachers and the 
students were the humans. 
</P>
<P>
The school was such a success and the humans learned so quickly that the 
animals got together and voted to continue the program. (Let the record show 
that the giraffes had to be bribed with carrots and that Gainda, the Indian 
rhinoceros, demanded more quality petting time.) 
</P>
<P>
So once again this summer, from now through August, the Wild Animal Park is 
offering one-, two-, three- and five-morning classes for youngsters from Grade 
1 through high school. The emphasis is on hands-on learning. Students join 
teachers, staff biologists and keepers to pet, feed, count, look at, listen to 
and -- most important -- learn about the creatures whose world we share. 
</P>
<P>
And for adults? They haven't been forgotten. From now through September, animal 
admirers and wildlife photographers ages 12 and up can sign up for special 
family and photo caravan safaris into the huge exhibits themselves. 
</P>
<P>
These open-air, bumpy expeditions, with 10 guests and two guides standing in 
the back of a truck, spend a couple of hours driving on the dirt roads through 
four of the park's five major habitats, the East and South African, and the 
Asian Plains and Asian Waterhole, about 320 acres in all. The guides stop the 
truck at various places to talk about the different animals and hand out 
carrots and apples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Taste of Africa 
</P>
<P>
"The caravans are a little taste of Africa," says Larry Killmar, curator of 
mammals. "They're not so rugged or stressful as a safari in Africa, but they 
get the people down close." 
</P>
<P>
Right! One minute you're adjusting your sunglasses, the next you're looking up 
to see three tons of beady-eyed rhino barreling up to the truck. Then he -- or 
she -- stops and thrusts that huge wrinkled face and rubbery lips right next to 
yours. 
</P>
<P>
You may want to shriek or faint. Yech -- kissed by a rhino! Instead, hand over 
an apple and grab your camera. This is a rare chance to shoot wildlife photos 
from a distance of six inches. 
</P>
<P>
Bring your telephoto lens too, to snap candids of this year's crop of shy 
babies. Says Killmar, who has been with the park since it opened in 1972: 
"April to August is the heavy calving season. We can have as many as eight 
births in a day -- they happen right out there in the exhibits." 
</P>
<P>
If feeding fruit to rhinos seems unnatural when the park's goal is to create an 
authentic living setting for the animals, you are right. And when excessive 
contact with humans does interfere with the animals' social group behavior, 
park biologists eschew it. 
</P>
<P>
But, Killmar says, offering treats to unpredictable and easily spooked Indian 
rhinos is the safest way to manage these 6,000-pound creatures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Familiarity Breeds Friendship 
</P>
<P>
"From day one we get the rhino calves used to touching by the keepers," Killmar 
says. "If you give them apples and carrots and goodies, they'll do anything for 
you. This allows us to move them around -- even crate them -- without using any 
tranquilizers." 
</P>
<P>
Each caravan has its own surprises. On a recent outing, Wild Animal Park 
spokesman Tom Hanscom spotted a newly laid ostrich egg lying on the muddy river 
bank. The eggs are a favorite target for hawks, so he stopped to collect it. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors handed it around and agreed it felt large, heavy and very hard. 
Just the right size for an omelet, someone commented. "Do you know how to cook 
an ostrich egg?" Hanscom asked. "You put the egg and a rock in a pot of boiling 
water. When the rock's done, so is the egg." 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters coming to the park from the San Diego area usually are dropped off 
by their parents or ride the bus from Escondido, but residents of Los Angeles 
probably will find that the park is too far for a daily drive. 
</P>
<P>
A solution is to enroll the child in a one-day class (held each Thursday 
morning) and combine it with an all-day family visit to the park. Human cubs, 
grades one through six, join a "Wild Walkabout," visiting koalas and kangaroos 
and all the other strange fauna and flora from the Down Under continent, while 
students in grades seven to 12 enroll in the class called "Close Enough to 
Touch," similar to the photo caravans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Budding Zoologists 
</P>
<P>
The older students actually accompany the keepers into the exhibits, through 
double-chain-link gates to help feed and count the zebras and gazelles and feel 
the giraffe's warm breath when it bends down for a carrot. 
</P>
<P>
If a budding zoologist begs for a three-day class, consider a mini-vacation for 
the family at one of the golf and leisure resorts east of Escondido or motel 
accommodations in that area. 
</P>
<P>
Start a day at the Wild Animal Park with a ride on the Wgasa Bush Line 
monorail. The monorail runs around the hills above the major habitats and 
provides an overview of the 2,500 animals that live behind special fencing 
called "inrigging." 
</P>
<P>
The fencing isn't all that tall, but it has a tremendous overhang at the top. 
As our monorail tour guide Becky Boomer announced: "The animals get up next to 
the fence and look up. When they see something over their heads, they think 
they can't jump out." 
</P>
<P>
On the ride, keep an eye out for a family of wild golden eagles circling 
overhead. The eagles are a few of the wild birds that have taken up residence 
in the surrounding hilltops and are getting fat on the gophers and mice that 
help themselves to animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
"We call them locals," Hanscom says, explaining that the Wild Animal Park 
spends between $41,000 and $46,000 monthly on animal food. The grocery bill 
would be higher, but the park actually grows some of its own browse food, such 
as eucalyptus, on the park's 1,800 acres. 
</P>
<P>
After the ride, visitors walk around the 1 1/4-mile Kilimanjaro Trail for a 
closer look into the special, smaller exhibits: the Sumatran tiger's woody 
hollow, the elephant enclosure, the lowland gorilla's lair and the cheetah's 
grassy plain. The animals are fascinating to watch, but their presence points 
to the Wild Animal Park's real purpose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protective Coloration 
</P>
<P>
The park's protective coloration -- the Nairobi Village's thatched snack bar, 
outdoor cafe, T-shirt shop, souvenir store, live animal shows, the petting 
kraal -- is designed like a theme park to attract humans. But, Hanscom says, 
the park's real purpose is 'to breed endangered species, and to study breeding 
problems of animals in captivity." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he says, researchers discovered that flamingos wouldn't lay 
fertilized eggs unless there were at least 100 birds in the flock. "It's the 
number that seems to click the hormones and make them go," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"And the Southern White Rhino . . . for years, the two in the San Diego Zoo 
just ignored each other. Then they brought 20 females out here to the animal 
park and moved the male out here to retire, but all he needed was space and a 
harem. In 11 years, he sired 65 calves." 
</P>
<P>
However, numbers aren't always a determining factor. There are cheetahs in the 
wilds, but genetic studies reveal that they're very inbred, probably because 
they live in isolated family groups. As a result, many females are sterile or 
there's a high infant mortality. So the park is breeding cheetahs with better 
genes, then making them available to other zoos. 
</P>
<P>
The park's summer programs are scheduled almost every day of the week. Photo 
caravans run on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday afternoons from May 
through September. Groups of 10 booking together can go any day. Each caravan 
is 1 3/4 hours long; tickets are $50 for adults 16 and older and $35 for 
children 12-15 with an adult. Children under 12 are not permitted on this 
caravan. The East African and the Asian Plains caravan leaves at 2:30 p.m. The 
caravan to the South African habitat and the Asian Waterhole leaves at 4:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
You can take both tours for a full 3 1/2-hour safari; $75 for adults and $50 
for children. Because San Diego Zoological Society members get a big discount 
on all special tours, it may be possible to save money by joining the zoo at 
the time you enroll. The photo caravans always are sold out and must be booked 
in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Caravans are similar to photo caravans but emphasize learning about 
and visiting family groups of animals rather than photography. They run Monday 
evenings from 5:30 to 7 p.m. Tickets are $55 for one adult with one child, and 
$80 for one adult with two children. Children must be 8 or older and be with an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day summer school runs Monday through Friday from 9 to 11:30 a.m., 
with a separate class for each grade level from 1 to 9. The three-day 
summer-school program runs Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 
p.m. The fee is $50 and five different classes serve different grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
The one-day program runs each Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and costs $22 
to $35. Different classes are designed for three age groups. 
</P>
<P>
The "Keeper Connection" is a two-session career exploration class for 
10th-to-12th graders who are considering animal-related careers. The fee is 
$50; the first session in August is on the 11th, and participants have a choice 
for the second second sesssion of any day between Aug. 14 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
You can enroll by telephone and pay by credit card. Call the Summer School 
Hotline at (619) 740-9383, or the San Diego Zoo at (619) 236-0163. You also can 
write to the Summer School, San Diego Zoo, P.O. Box 551, San Diego, Calif. 
92112-0551, but expect a several-week processing delay. 
</P>
<P>
Wild Animal Park hours are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. through Sept. 4 (Labor Day), and 9 
a.m. to 4 p.m. after. The park is 30 miles north of San Diego on Interstate 15, 
then east on Highway 78. From Los Angeles take Interstate 5 south to Oceanside, 
then California 78 east to the park. A ticket package (entrance, monorail ride, 
animal shows and exhibits) is $12.95 for adults, $6.20 for ages 3-15, ages 2 
and under free. Stroller and wheelchair rentals are available. No pets, please; 
the wild animals frown on it.

LOVE IN BLOOM: THE WEIDNERS AND THEIR BEGONIA GARDENS IN LEUCADIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shoppers trek to Leucadia from all over Southern California. As often as 
not, they bring grandmas, children, picnics and -- of course -- spades and a 
spare pot or three. 
</P>
<P>
Weidners' Begonia Gardens is not your typical neighborhood nursery. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Weidners' hosts its annual begonia festival, during which you can 
attend free lectures on everything from putting color in your garden to 
propagation tips. You also can dig up tuberous begonias for as little as $4.95 
a plant. 
</P>
<P>
Bob and Evelyn Weidner grew up in the plant business. "I was retail and married 
wholesale," Evelyn Weidner says. The couple owned Buena Park Greenhouses for 
years but decided they'd had enough, took early retirement in 1969 and moved to 
a lovely piece of land 10 miles south of Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
The retirement lasted two years. "Bob came to me one day in 1971 and asked if I 
would like a nice big patch of tuberous begonias," Evelyn Weidner recalls. "I 
thought he meant 50 for the back yard." But Bob Weidner planted 25,000 of the 
gorgeous plants in raised beds, and the family was back in the nursery 
business. Today, Evelyn and daughter Mary Witesman run the nursery; Bob Weidner 
died last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enormous Selection 
</P>
<P>
Weidners' Gardens is chock full of not only the tuberous begonias -- they do 
have thousands of them, in both regular and non-stop varieties -- but also an 
enormous selection of flowering plants from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, there were just the begonias. Then we hung a basket of fuchsias near 
the checkout stand and everyone wanted it, so we started carrying fuchsias," 
which are, like begonias, shade-loving, Evelyn Weidner says. "Then people 
started saying, 'But we have no shade,' so we put in Sunshine Alley." 
</P>
<P>
Weidners' thus began a tradition of adding a new type of plant every year. "We 
either look for something old that people have sort of forgotten about or we 
find something overseas," Weidner says. "That's why some of our plants' names 
don't mean anything to people, because they're nothing you've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
And Weidners' has what few nurseries have -- a green and inviting lawn dotted 
with picnic tables, a stream with a bridge, a pond with ducks and a petting zoo 
full of friendly goats, sheep and assorted unusual fowl. Stormy, perhaps the 
most patient pony ever born, whinnies at the corral's gate, eager to be fed a 
snack and willing to carry the smallest of children on his plump back. And the 
air is fresh with ocean breezes even on scorching days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gardener Motivator 
</P>
<P>
But the best thing about Weidners' is the inspiration it provides for the 
weekend gardener. Plants -- most are in pots; the begonias are usually the only 
things you dig yourself -- are meticulously tended and displayed; color is 
everywhere. Hand-written signs give simple, clear advice on how to grow your 
selections, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. And the prices are 
almost incredibly low: Many shoppers question the staff repeatedly to make sure 
they've heard correctly when told a 4-foot basket of wax-leaf begonias is only 
$7.95. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted this to look like a flower show all the time," Weidner says. "People 
shouldn't have to go all the way to Santa Cruz to see a big display of 
begonias." 
</P>
<P>
The begonias are at their peak now; many are 6 inches across and available in 
shades of orange, yellow, red and pink. They're planted in neat rows hundreds 
of yards long under high, white tarps to filter the sun. Fuchsias -- thousands 
of them in a rich range of hues -- spill from baskets hanging from the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
A prize specimen of one of the most spectacular plants available at Weidners' 
greets you just as you park: An 8-foot angel's trumpet tree (Brugmansia) drips 
with butter-yellow flowers more than 7 inches long. Angel's trumpet likes sun 
and space and will bloom three seasons out of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The front fence is densely covered with an Alice DuPont Mandevilla vine studded 
with deep pink, horn-shaped blossoms with golden throats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Covers Vast Expanses 
</P>
<P>
"The Mandevilla likes sunny to partially shady locations," Weidner says. The 
vine grows fast, allowing you to cover vast expanses of trellis by the end of 
summer, but it does freeze back. 
</P>
<P>
A close cousin to the Mandevilla is the Red Ridinghood Dipladenia, which 
Weidners' found in Australia. The plant doesn't vine but stays bushy and 
relatively small; cherry-pink blooms will flourish year-round in Southern 
California if you feed the plant every two weeks and keep it where it will have 
a bit of relief from midday sun. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find colored calla lilies in shades of yellow and pink. Gold coin 
daisies from the Canary Islands do beautifully in big pots. "The old blossoms 
on the gold coins just disappear, so you don't have to spend a lot of time 
dead-heading (removing faded flowers)," Weidner says. 
</P>
<P>
Peruvian lilies -- those delicate, orchid-like flowers that adorn so many 
restaurant tables and that last two weeks after cutting -- have been hybridized 
to stay short and compact for the home garden. 
</P>
<P>
Weidners' has them all, and more -- enough to keep your family busy for hours 
to allow you to enjoy your afternoon.

A quarterly earnings report in Friday's Business section included an erroneous 
statement regarding deposits at Home Savings of America, a subsidiary of H. F. 
Ahmanson &amp; Co. The correct information is as follows: Deposits at Home 
Savings increased by a record $1.3 billion during the second quarter, equal to 
a 17.6% annual growth rate. At the end of the second quarter, the company had 
$31.5 billion in deposits, compared to $29.3 billion at the end of 1988's 
second quarter. Also, the name of Ahmanson's chairman and chief executive, 
Richard H. Deihl, was misspelled.

MILITARY POLICE TURN RADAR GUNS ON SPEEDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Military police at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station have started using 
radar guns in combination with a radar display board to try to reduce speeding 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
An officer aims a radar gun at an oncoming vehicle and the display board 
sitting on top of the military police car flashes the car's speed. The military 
police are authorized to issue speeding tickets based on the radar reading, 
said Sgt. John P. Falcetti III, chief accident investigator. 
</P>
<P>
The location of the radar unit will change from day to day, and it will also be 
used off-base on Trabuco Road near El Toro Marine School. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, military policemen issued 1,540 speeding tickets on the base. So far 
this year, 500 drivers have been ticketed for speeding.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: ORANGE; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE RULES THAT GATES HAS KEY ROLE IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Friday ruled in favor of the city of Orange in its 
lawsuit with the county over expansion of the Theo Lacy Branch Jail, saying 
that Sheriff Brad Gates is actually the lead administrator on the project 
rather than the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Projections and studies done by the county about the impact of the jail 
expansion on the surrounding area have been based on decision-making power 
belonging to the supervisors. Under the judge's ruling, those studies would 
also have to analyze how the sheriff's decisions about jail operations might 
effect the area. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the county have already appealed the judge's decision, based on a 
similar preliminary ruling he had made earlier. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel Adrian Kuyper said Friday, however, that if the judge's decision 
is upheld, the county could be forced to redo its environmental impact report, 
causing significant delays for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county officials and the city of Orange are still negotiating a 
possible compromise for the jail expansion that could involve dismissal of the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
The county is planning to expand the capacity of the branch jail, on The City 
Drive in Orange, from 622 inmates to 1,326. The $45-million construction job 
was scheduled to begin last spring and the first new structures were to open by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion is a major component of the county's effort to relieve severe 
overcrowding in its jail system.

GUINNESS SAYS HO-HUM TO TONY'S WORLD FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the fast-changing and crowded world of aviation milestones, Tony Aliengena's 
name will be entered in the National Aviation Assn.'s books as the youngest 
pilot to circumnavigate the globe. 
</P>
<P>
There was no such category before. He is breaking nobody's record. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that his accomplishment is not worth noting, but editors at 
the Guinness Book of World Records said they passed on the San Juan Capistrano 
youngster's feat because there are so many young people clambering over each 
other to establish or break previous records set by other child pilots. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard about that youngster," Cyd Smith, assistant editor for the Guinness 
Book of World Records in New York City, said about Tony. "But we don't keep 
records on young aviators anymore. There are a lot of other youngsters who fly 
at that age. But they're not flying nonstop, and they're obviously not flying 
alone. They're flying with instructors and such. There was just no point in the 
category anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Tony himself said two years ago that it was news of an 11-year-old 
Texas boy's record-setting, transcontinental flight that prompted him to try 
the same thing last year. He did, and then his name replaced that of John Kevin 
Hill as the youngest person to make that trip. 
</P>
<P>
Hill is 13 now and living in Arlington, Tex. Told that Tony was about to arrive 
back home, Hill said he is happy for the California aviator, but conceded that 
he had not been following Tony's adventure. 
</P>
<P>
At the headquarters of the National Aviation Administration in Washington, June 
Gretchner, assistant secretary to the contests and record board, flipped 
through the pages of the record book, looking for the category into which 
Tony's trip might fit. She couldn't find one. 
</P>
<P>
She said the organization is widely recognized as the official recorder of the 
competitive and elusive accomplishments set in a variety of aviation 
adventures, in everything from hot-air balloons to Lear Jets to tiny 
two-seaters. 
</P>
<P>
In the NAA's record books are myriad names of people who claim to have made the 
fastest trip from one city to another, the longest nonstop flight from point A 
to point B, or the longest trip in a hot-air balloon, and so on. There are 
categories by size of craft, type of craft, age of pilot, geographical 
distance, speed and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Countless numbers of people have circumnavigated the globe in airplanes, she 
said, but the one everyone remembers is the nonstop, non-refuel, 
round-the-world-trip on the Voyager by Jeana Yeager and Dick Rutan. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Tony is not only establishing the record as the youngest person 
to circumnavigate the globe, but he is also the first American to fly across 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Some local pilots, however, have questioned the significance of the record 
because Tony had not done it alone. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Murrel, who piloted one of the chase planes that accompanied Tony early in 
the journey, objected to criticism by other pilots who said it is Tony's father 
who was planning the strategy for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's accomplishment, he replied, requires a "mature enough kid to handle the 
responsibility of flying an aircraft. It's not just a casual thing to do."

SPORTS KIDS MEET OFF; PROGRAM TO STAY ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Olympian Bob Mathias said Friday that his Irvine-based Sports Kids 
organization has called off its summer games for children in Mexico because the 
group has no money to stage the event. But he said the Sports Kids program will 
be kept alive because "it's too good an idea to drop." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really disappointed (about) what happened," Mathias told The Times in a 
telephone interview. "We are going to regroup and plan bigger and better for 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
Mathias, the first person to win back-to-back Olympic decathlons, in 1948 and 
in 1952, said that Sports Kids cash problems were the result of a Texas 
financier's failure to make good a promise to donate $5 million. The summer 
event, called Earth Games, was scheduled to begin Aug. 13 in Tijuana and run 
for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Kids official Chuck Foster said he has notified sponsors and others that 
the games will not be held. He said similar notification will be sent to more 
than 50 countries that had confirmed that they were sending children to the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"We have run out of time," Foster said. "If you can't do the games right, it is 
best we postpone them until we can do them correctly." 
</P>
<P>
The organization figured that it needed between $350,000 and $485,000 in cash 
to stage the games. Officials said more than $1 million in non-monetary 
contributions for the Mexico games had been received, but that cash was still 
needed to stage the event. 
</P>
<P>
According to the group's books, Sports Kids had a negative balance of $5 in its 
checking account Thursday and its current liabilities were listed at $550,000. 
Much of the deficit was in salaries owed to full-time staff members who have 
never received a paycheck, officials said. Sports Kids was founded about 18 
months ago by Mathias. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Kids officials said they were introduced to Houston businessman Michael 
A.C. Makris in January through a charity broker who described him as a 
multimillionaire who wanted to donate a large sum of money to a nonprofit 
organization devoted to the development of children. 
</P>
<P>
When Makris failed to make the first installment of the $5 million, Foster said 
he began checking with prominent people that Makris said he knew well. None of 
them knew him, Foster said, adding that he later learned that Makris had a 
criminal record and had served two prison terms for fraud and perjury. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Makris acknowledged that he had served time in 
prison, but contended that his convictions were "politically motivated." Makris 
said he would give Sports Kids $5 million if Foster, whom he called a poor 
administrator, resigned. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated July 12 to Sports Kids staff members, Makris wrote: "I was 
and I am still interested in funding, personally, the entire program." But he 
added that before he deposits $5 million, Foster would have to resign. Makris 
said he had offered Foster $100,000 to "peacefully leave." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
But Foster said he doesn't believe Makris has the money, and Mathias agreed: 
</P>
<P>
"We thought he was the white knight, someone who really wanted to help young 
people." Mathias said. "We still have these goals; apparently he does not. We 
don't want to deal with those kinds of people." 
</P>
<P>
Mathias said the Sports Kids staff "checked out Makris pretty thoroughly. We 
were just fooled by him." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, The Times reported that Sports Kids owed about $80,000 to former 
Irvine City Councilman C. David Baker. After Baker was convicted of forging a 
check to finance his faltering congressional campaign last year, he performed 
community service work for the organization and ultimately accepted a full-time 
job, although he resigned in April. 
</P>
<P>
Mathias said Baker was a "wonderful guy who liked kids," but that he did not 
"work out with our organization." 
</P>
<P>
Foster said Sports Kids had agreed to Makris' request not to raise money from 
any other sources. But he added that the organization will return to 
traditional fund-raising efforts now that the $5 million is not forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all disappointed, but we will regroup and set our goals for next year," 
Mathias said. "The concept is just too good an idea to drop." 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Kids program focuses on the character development of children from 5 
to 12 through participation in sports.

REGENTS SUPPORT UCI'S PROPOSAL TO CANCEL MEDI-CAL CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UC Board of Regents on Friday approved a resolution supporting UCI Medical 
Center's proposal to cancel its Medi-Cal contract if the state refuses to 
increase reimbursement rates for Orange County hospitals, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason told the regents he wants Medi-Cal officials to 
rebuild the network of Orange County hospitals willing to accept indigent 
patients to ease the burden on UCI Medical Center, said Susan Meister, a public 
affairs representative for UCI's Health Science Division. 
</P>
<P>
Meister said the Board of Regents' approval in San Francisco on Friday 
authorizes UCI Medical Center officials to proceed with the cancellation of the 
Medi-Cal contract should hospital officials decide to do so. But she emphasized 
that negotiations are continuing with the state over the medical care contract. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the school-run hospital in Orange want Medi-Cal officials to 
increase the amount of reimbursement given annually for treatment of poor 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Meister noted that the medical center maintains 6% of the hospital beds in 
Orange County but treats half the county's Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a truly equitable distribution of indigent patients before we 
will consider that the (Medi-Cal) network has been reconstructed" in Orange 
County, she said. 
</P>
<P>
There are 24 acute-care hospitals in the county, and only three accept Medi-Cal 
patients. Most of those declining to accept Medi-Cal patients terminated their 
contracts with the health group within the last year, Meister said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to take more than our fair share, but not half of the 
(Medi-Cal) patients (in the county)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other hospitals that currently have Medi-Cal contracts have indicated that they 
may drop out of the program if UCI Medical Center does so. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Medical Center is the only UC hospital that operated in the red last year, 
losing $11.2 million, and hospital officials said they are being reimbursed for 
less than half the cost of caring for Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
County health workers have warned that if UCI drops its Medi-Cal patients, it 
could create a domino effect in the county and the remaining hospitals that 
accept the state-supported patients would drop out of the program.

SUSPECTED ARRESTED AFTER HOTEL GUESTS ARE ROBBED IN PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buena Park police arrested a suspect Friday in a string of armed robberies in 
which a man approached hotel guests in parking lots, brandished what looked 
like a pistol and demanded money. 
</P>
<P>
Michael David Hollif, 19, of Kansas was arrested early Friday after police saw 
a man at the Embassy Suites Hotel, 7762 Beach Blvd., hold up a family in the 
parking lot, said Tom Shearn, a Buena Park police training manager. 
</P>
<P>
Hollif was charged with one count of armed robbery and is being held at Orange 
County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
The family, Jeffrey and Pamela Hirsh and their two daughters, all of Garland, 
Tex., were returning to the hotel at 1:37 a.m., Shearn said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect "creeped up behind them and yelled at them," he said. "He demanded 
their money." 
</P>
<P>
The Hirshes, who were not carrying wallets or purses, gave him an undetermined 
amount of money from their shirt pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Police then chased the suspect, who fled over a wall and into a strawberry 
field just west of the hotel. An officer fired one shot but missed the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Hollif was arrested at 1:51 a.m. when officers, assisted by a Costa Mesa 
helicopter and Anaheim police dogs, found him hiding in a shed in the 7700 
block of Dahlia Circle. The suspect was carrying a piece of wood that resembled 
a .45-caliber pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Victims have reported several other similar armed robberies since July 13, 
Shearn said, including one in which about $300 was taken at the Quality Inn, 
7555 Beach Blvd. Victims reported two other armed robberies, both at the 
Embassy Suites, on Monday and Wednesday, where a total of $1,000 in cash and 
traveler's checks were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect fits victims' descriptions of a man about 6 feet tall, and wearing 
a hooded sweat shirt under a plaid shirt, Shearn said. 
</P>
<P>
Police saw a man of that description Thursday morning at the Holiday Inn Buena 
Park, 7000 Beach Blvd., but a hotel security guard apparently scared him away, 
Shearn said.

UC IRVINE SAILORS DESERVE RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Murray rightly acknowledges the fine tradition and coaching of Eddie 
Merrins golf program at UCLA; and the focus on the 1988 National Collegiate 
Championship for UCLA golf team is surely justified. 
</P>
<P>
However, in recognizing other L.A. area national championship teams in 1988, he 
neglected to mention the UC Irvine sailing team. Collegiate sailing is perhaps 
the most demanding and competitive sailing in the world, and graduates of its 
ranks go on to be the sport's Olympic medalists and even America's Cup 
competitors. In 1988, Irvine won both the Dinghy National Championship and the 
Team Racing Championship. Irvine also had four skippers and one crew earn 
All-American honors. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, Coach Craig Wilson's Anteater sailing team deserves far more 
recognition and credit than has been afforded it by the L.A. Times.

For an inning at least, the Detroit Tigers snapped out of their woeful hitting 
and knocked the Angels' pitching silly Friday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The game took a decided turn for the worse for the Angels in the fourth inning, 
though they eventually rallied for an 8-7 victory on Wally Joyner's two-run 
homer in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible to be more specific, but the hits in that fourth inning all 
seemed to blur together. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the inning, the Angels led, 4-2. But two singles, three doubles and 
nine batters later, the lead had disappeared as had starter Mike Witt, who left 
after 3 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Witt was shaky from the start, allowing runs in the first two innings. But in 
the third, he retired the Tigers in order. 
</P>
<P>
Then the nightmarish fourth began. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Moreland started the inning with a single to right field. 
</P>
<P>
Chet Lemon, a lifetime .429 hitter against Witt but just a .250 hitter against 
the rest of the league this season, forced Moreland. After Doug Strange flied 
out, it all unraveled for Witt. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Pettis, fresh off a four-strikeout performance Thursday night, singled 
through Witt's legs and into center field. It was the second hit of the night 
for Pettis, who came into the game hitting .232 with three RBIs and one home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Lemon raced around to third on Pettis' single. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Mike Heath, who lined a double down the right-field line that scored 
Lemon and Pettis. 
</P>
<P>
Tigers 4, Angels 4. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Bergman placed a sinking liner just inside the right-field line for a 
double to score Heath. 
</P>
<P>
Tigers 5, Angels 4. 
</P>
<P>
Next up was Tracy Jones, who, just to be different doubled down the left-field 
line, scoring Bergman. 
</P>
<P>
Tigers 6, Angels 4. 
</P>
<P>
Three doubles and you're out was the way pitching coach Marcel Lachemann 
figured and he took Witt out of the game and replaced him with Rich Monteleone 
at that point. 
</P>
<P>
Monteleone watched as Jones took third base on Lance Parrish's passed ball. 
Then, he turned around and walked Lou Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Alan Trammell, the ninth batter in the inning. Trammell hit a sharp 
line drive, but it was right at second baseman Johnny Ray, who caught it for 
the third out. 
</P>
<P>
Four runs on five hits. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad showing for a team that ranks last in the American League in hitting. 
The Tigers came into the game with a paltry .242 team batting average. 
</P>
<P>
Only Moreland, who's hitting .313, is above .300. The next highest is Jones 
with a .283 average. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker, who hit his 20th home run of the season in the ninth inning, is the 
lone Tiger among AL leaders. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, catcher Matt Nokes, who is one of the few power-hitters 
on the Tiger roster, is on the disabled list with an injured knee suffered when 
Chili Davis collided with him in June. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder the Tigers are in last place in the AL East and have the worst 
record (33-60) in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
They've been there since June 7 and don't appear to be capable of moving out of 
there anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
But for an inning Friday, they seemed to put it all together.

HELMSLEY NOT FLATTERED IN COURTROOM TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The portrait of Leona Helmsley emerging in a Manhattan courtroom bears little 
resemblance to the smiling queen whose finicky attention to detail is trumpeted 
in slick magazine ads for her Helmsley Palace hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, both Leonas would demand the best. But the queen would pay for it, and 
the queen's English would be a bit more majestic. 
</P>
<P>
"You (expletive), you're not my partner; you don't tell me how to spend my 
money," Helmsley once said, according to a former underling who was a 
prosecution witness at her federal trial on extortion and tax fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, former Helmsley executive Jeremiah McCarthy, testified that 
Helmsley screamed at him when he refused to sign a phony voucher that billed 
work performed at her mansion to the Helmsley business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused in Payoffs 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley and two former employees allegedly engaged in a false-invoice scheme 
and used company money to pay for $4 million in work on the Helmsleys' 28-room 
estate in Greenwich, Conn. She is also accused of taking payoffs from Helmsley 
suppliers, sometimes in cash-plump envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
Her 80-year-old husband, Harry, was severed from the case because of a loss of 
memory caused by a series of slight strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the jury has heard only the prosecution case. The trial, in its third 
week, is expected to last two more months, and there is no indication of 
whether Helmsley will take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
She would have a lot to rebut. Each day, observers have been regaled by stories 
starring the 69-year-old queen of a $5-billion real estate empire. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, never the people's choice in a town where rents have skyrocketed, has 
become the people's pariah. Everette Dennis, head of the Gannett Center for 
Media Studies, said Helmsley has become a person of "singular unpopularity in 
New York." 
</P>
<P>
Impeccably dressed and coiffed, she sits in the courtroom, generally stoical 
but sometimes laughing, shaking her head or crying, as witness after witness 
describes her as an overbearing, abusive, capricious employer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negative Testimony 
</P>
<P>
There has been so much negative testimony regarding Helmsley's personality that 
U.S. District Court Judge John Walker has called for a moratorium. "I think 
this case would move much more quickly if we concentrated on the evidence 
rather than the personality issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury had already gotten an earful: 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy testified that Helmsley once refused to pay a $13,000 bill to a 
contractor who had built a barbecue pit. McCarthy pleaded the contractor's case 
-- the man had six kids, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't he keep his pants on? He wouldn't have so many problems," Helmsley 
said, according to the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Baum, a former housekeeper at the mansion, recalled remarking to 
Helmsley that the Helmsleys must pay a lot of taxes. She recalled Helmsley's 
response: "We don't pay taxes, only the little people pay taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley told Steven Chang, a Helmsley engineer, to duplicate at the estate an 
underground sound system she had seen at Disney World. Chang said she charged 
the $57,000 cost to the business, and then fired him because the hidden 
speakers were not hidden enough and they once went on at 4:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer, Gerald A. Feffer, has done little to challenge the unpleasant 
portrait of his client, except to point out that the Helmsleys did pay $58 
million in taxes from 1983 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Churlishness Underscored 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Feffer has gone out of his way to underscore Helmsley's churlishness. 
In his opening statement, Feffer referred to her as a "tough bitch" who was 
"abrasive" and "demanding" because of the pressures applied to a woman who 
fought to make it in a man's world. 
</P>
<P>
"In the United States we don't put people in jail for being unpopular," Feffer 
told the jury.

JOKERS HIT TACO BELL; 
</P>
<P>
BATMANIACS SWIPING MOVIE TIE-IN CARDBOARD CUTOUTS IN HUGELY SUCCESSFUL 
PROMOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Caped Crusader as an inspiration to crooks? 
</P>
<P>
For the past few weeks, a bunch of jokers have been invading Taco Bell outlets, 
swiping cardboard cutouts of Batman. The enormously popular cutouts are all 
part of Taco Bell's $10-million summer promotion -- a Batman Collector Cup 
giveaway that has shattered company sales records for promotional tie-ins. 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell has tied into movies before -- by handing out "Star Trek" glasses, 
for example. But Batmaniacs have made the latest promotion by far the chain's 
biggest and best yet, said Bob Phillips, company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Taco Bell store on Barranca Parkway in Irvine. Three weeks ago, the 
restaurant began displaying the larger-than-life Batman cutouts and handing out 
plastic Batman cups to customers who buy a large soft drink. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the promotion started, two people nabbed an eight-foot-tall 
Batman cutout and sprinted away. But most Batfans are more law-abiding and pay 
for their bat paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
Since the promotion, sales have been "unbelievable," said Frank Compani, 
manager of the Irvine store. "They come in for Batman cups, then they buy a 
meal with it." 
</P>
<P>
At Compani's store on Barranca, that translates to a sales jump of at least 25% 
since the promotion started. Where the store ordinarily sells no more than 600 
large drinks each day, "we're going through about 1,000 a day now," said 
Compani. 
</P>
<P>
With the movie "Batman" predicted to do boffo business even before it opened, 
executives of Irvine-based Taco Bell knew the fast-food company's promotional 
tie-in would be popular. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Warner Bros. flick is this summer's biggest moneymaker, with 
earnings so far soaring to $167.6 million. The wholesale domestic revenues for 
official Batmania items -- including key chains, raincoats, hats and towels -- 
are projected at up to $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
So it was a sure bet for Taco Bell to shell out undisclosed bucks for the 
licensing rights. 
</P>
<P>
But holy taco shells! Even Taco Bell didn't realize it would be giving away 
Batman cups as fast as they're delivered to the restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell had planned on giving away about 10 million Batman cups by the time 
the promotion ends late this month. Instead, the company estimates that nearly 
double that amount -- or up to 21 million drinks -- already have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the cup manufacturer, Louisiana Plastics of Louisiana, Mo., has been 
operating around the clock at full-capacity to keep up with the Batcup demand, 
said Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell's competitors, Del Taco and Naugles, meanwhile, launched a summer 
promotion of their own at about the same time that Taco Bell began its Batman 
cup give-away. 
</P>
<P>
Del Taco and Naugles, both owned by Costa Mesa-based AWR II Inc., began selling 
10-cent burritos with any soft-drink purchase several weeks ago. Since then, 
the number of customers coming into the restaurants has climbed 15% to 30%, 
said company President Wayne Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Taco Bell's Batman promotion has not affected the Del Taco and Naugles 
restaurants, Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean that Taco Bell's Batcraze isn't a tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
To give you an idea of the demand, consider that 8% to 16% of Taco Bell 
customers ordinarily buy 32-ounce soft drinks. Since the promotion began, a 
sampling in the Los Angeles market shows that half of the customers are buying 
the large drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell doesn't have data yet on how the Batcraze has affected sales of other 
menu items at the chain's 3,000 restaurants nationwide. But "we're sure it has 
affected some of the other products," said Elliot Bloom, Taco Bell spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
And burritos and tacos aren't all that customers are walking out with. 
Batmaniacs from Orange to Alabama are still walking off with those eight-foot 
Batman cutouts, Batman banners and Batman counter-displays. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, said Phillips, "we're hoping maybe Batman himself will show up 
at the stores to rescue himself from overzealous fans."

$200,000 AMERICAN CONTINENTAL GIFT TO GLENN DISCLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) received $200,000 in undisclosed corporate donations 
for his political action committee in 1985 and 1986 from the head of a 
California thrift for whom he later intervened with federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn's disclosure, prompted by queries from Ohio reporters, brings to at least 
$1.35 million the amount in donations and gifts that Charles H. Keating Jr. and 
his American Continental Corp. of Phoenix raised over a two-year period for the 
favorite causes of five senators who argued Keating's position in meetings with 
top officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank board in April 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said he solicited $850,000 
from Keating for three voter-education projects, including one started by his 
son. It has been reported previously that Keating and his business associates 
contributed more than $320,000 to Cranston, Glenn and three other senators who 
attended the meetings on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's thrift, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine, was seized by 
regulators in April, a day after American Continental entered bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn, whose campaigns also have received $34,000 in reported donations from 
Keating, his family and employees, said in an interview Thursday that there was 
no connection between the Keating donations and the senator's decision to 
attend the meetings with thrift regulators. "Do you forget the $234,000? No, 
you don't," Glenn said. "But that doesn't have one thing to do with whether I 
would compromise a vote or access to my office or my personal principles." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn said he has known Keating, who is from Ohio, for years and has voted 
against other requests he made. He said he went to the meetings with regulators 
after investigating Keating's complaints about the length of an examination of 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, has said 
the meeting with the senators was a "grievous" attempt to "subvert the 
regulatory process." Glenn declined to respond to Gray's characterization. 
</P>
<P>
The previously unreported $200,000 in donations for Glenn were made to his PAC, 
the National Council on Public Policy. They were arranged by James Grogan, a 
former Glenn aide who became Keating's corporate counsel. Grogan also 
approached Glenn's staff about attending the meeting with bank board regulators 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
William R. White, a former Glenn aide who handled records for the now-defunct 
PAC, said Thursday that Grogan called him in the summer of 1985, saying Keating 
wanted to help Glenn. Grogran confirmed White's account, noting that Keating 
was a longtime supporter of Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the donations, Keating was actively campaigning to stop a 
proposed bank board rule that would limit Lincoln's direct investments outside 
the home mortgage field. 
</P>
<P>
A short time after Grogan's call, American Continental made the first of two 
$100,000 corporate contributions to the PAC's non-federal bank account. The 
second $100,000 check arrived in March, 1986. Such donations are legal. They 
also are controversial because they do not have to be reported publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn said his sole purpose in attending the meetings was to find out whether 
Lincoln was being treated fairly. According to extensive notes of the 
discussion at the April 9, 1987, meeting, Glenn said, "I'm not trying to get 
anyone off. If there is wrongdoing, I'm on your side. But I don't want any 
unfairness against a viable entity."

DRAMA-THERAPY TROUPE SPOTLIGHTS SEXUAL ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Shadow and Song," the Stop-Gap musical that premiered at South Coast 
Repertory's Second Stage on Thursday, represents the next step in the Santa 
Ana-based "drama-therapy" troupe's response to sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Originally entitled "When the Bough Breaks" when first produced by Stop-Gap in 
1982, it focused entirely on the pain suffered by a handful of children who had 
been mistreated. Now, with a new name and a revamped book by Orange County 
playwright John Weston, "Shadow and Song" centers on how the ache continues in 
adulthood, leading to ruined self-esteem, busted marriages, breakdowns and, in 
the worst scenario, turning the abused into the abuser. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty serious stuff for a musical. But "Shadow and Song" isn't so much about 
entertainment as it is about education. This isn't to say that Weston doesn't 
try to hold us with his story of grown-up Elizabeth cleansing herself of the 
past, but the show's primary goals are to provide insight for the public and a 
measure of catharsis for victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
It all fits in well with Stop-Gap's manifesto. This nonprofit group has, over 
the years, staged works probing a spectrum of issues and ills from alcoholism 
to date rape to AIDS. Even the less-accomplished productions could never be 
accused of apathy or heartlessness. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, it's easy to recommend "Shadow and Song." While Ron 
Creager's songs aren't really memorable, and the pivotal dramatic moments -- 
especially the confrontational resolution -- often jar with abrupt, pregnant 
importance, we still stay tuned. It has a message that everybody wants to hear: 
There is hope for victims. 
</P>
<P>
The show is really more of a drama sprinkled with several songs (many retained 
from "When the Bough Breaks," though they are not listed in the program) than 
what we generally think of as a musical. Exposition and dialogue aren't the 
threads that hold the tunes together, but the other way around. Here, what's 
significant are the facts we learn about Elizabeth (played as an adult by 
Sharon Murray and as a teen-ager by Karen Angela). 
</P>
<P>
Most of those are revealed through her interaction with the other characters, 
especially her dad (Douglas Rowe), a weak man who was physically abused by his 
own father. He dotes on Elizabeth and seems to be devoted. He also visits her 
bedroom for sex -- more than 40 times, we later learn (she's made a mark on the 
bedpost for each encounter). 
</P>
<P>
When she gets a little older, Elizabeth runs away and meets up with a street 
sleaze who preys on girls at the bus station. He crawls over and tries to get 
her involved in pornography. These brief scenes are the play's least 
convincing, bearing that inauthentic or cliched feel that so often taints 
made-for-TV movies on the same subject. But perhaps this is just how things 
develop for many victims; Stop-Gap should know. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth eventually becomes a successful songwriter and singer, but her last 
performance ends in an on-stage collapse. The feelings associated with the 
abuse overwhelm her. As she prepares to make a comeback with the help of a 
supportive manager (a spirited and natural performance by Catherine Rowe), 
Elizabeth has to deal with all that's been paralyzing her. 
</P>
<P>
Director Don R. Laffoon gets able performances from his cast. Karen Angela 
imbues the adolescent Elizabeth with buried turmoil, equal parts confusion and 
anger. Those feelings evolve in Sharon Murray's adult Elizabeth into a 
desperately impenetrable veneer erected to hide her vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
Angela and Murray sing all the songs, with Angela, a young actress, performing 
competently enough, and Murray, a singer with a rich voice, shining through the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe is unsettling as the father. It's creepy when he gives advice -- a little 
too earnestly -- on how "daddy's little girl" should dress more attractively, 
all the while caressing her shoulders, a little too affectionately. But you 
also feel a degree of sympathy for him when, at the conclusion, he reminds us 
that he too was a victim. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Elizabeth, having faced her father and condemned him for what he 
did, emerges triumphant. Now more confident, she belts out the last number. 
It's a contrived, even hokey, finale, but it does put Stop-Gap's banner of 
optimism under a bright light. 
</P>

The Fullerton College troupe that will stage "Tracers" at the Edinburgh 
Festival in Scotland, one of Europe's major international arts gatherings, has 
raised $21,000 so far toward the cost of the trip. A benefit performance of the 
Vietnam War drama last week added $2,000 to their fund-raising goal of $28,000, 
theater department chairman Bob Jensen said. Local and national corporations 
have contributed only $250, he said, despite a vigorous campaign seeing their 
help. "A number of companies wrote saying, 'Thanks, but no thanks," Jensen 
noted. "I was told informally that some of them thought the play was too 
controversial to support." Jensen said there is "no chance" the troupe will not 
go to Edinburgh for its scheduled performances (Aug. 16 to Sept. 3). The cast 
and crew of 18 people have agreed to ante up $7,000 if more donations can't be 
raised, he said.

STUNNED PRODUCERS OF 'GYPSY' TO SEE SHOW TESTED AT ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Broadway producers of "Gypsy," stunned by the show's anemic box office in 
Los Angeles, are looking to its second week at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center for signs of drawing power. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Weissler -- the main producer with her husband, Barry -- said they would 
be coming to see the show Sunday in Costa Mesa. "We're going to find out 
whether Orange County is a two-week market," she said from her office in New 
York. "It would be nice to think it is." 
</P>
<P>
"Gypsy" had the advantage of a subscription audience this week at the Center, 
which means a test of the show's "legs" will have to come next week. The 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion had no subscriber cushion. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the gross at the Chandler gave the producers a shock. "Gypsy" did only 
a third of capacity in its first week there and less than two-thirds in its 
second. "Can't you just die?" asked Weissler. "If you think it was weak, how do 
you think we feel?" 
</P>
<P>
The straight-talking Weissler volunteered that when people hear the word 
"Gypsy," they don't rush out to buy tickets because the musical is perceived as 
just another revival. "Certain shows obviously excite them, and this one does 
not," she said. "But then we open, and business doubles." That is precisely 
what happened at the Chandler, once the rave notices appeared. The box office 
gross leaped from $280,417 to $501,203 (out of a weekly potential of $837,954). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Weissler hopes to get the word out sooner for the rest of the 
"Gypsy" tour by shooting additional TV commercials. She said the new spots 
would be filmed Tuesday and Wednesday at the Center, for airing in New York and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
When the show leaves Costa Mesa after closing July 29, it heads to Houston for 
a week. Then it is scheduled for six weeks at the Kennedy Center, followed by 
an open-ended run on Broadway at the St. James Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
HAMMETT REVISITED: Arthur Laurents, who wrote "Gypsy" and directed this 
production, is already writing the libretto for his next show, "Nick and Nora." 
Yes, it's about Dashiell Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles. No, it's not like 
"The Thin Man" pictures of the '30s. 
</P>
<P>
"When you begin to examine those two characters, they're alcoholics," Laurents 
said. "She is this rich little Dresden doll who sits around while he solves the 
murders. He's very macho, puts her down all the time. What I've developed is 
that while they're investigating murder, they're investigating their 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
"Nick and Nora" will also be about over-weaning arrogance, which is why it is 
set in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"No place outside of Washington has more hubris," said Laurents, who has worked 
in movies on and off since the '40s. "Hollywood has the same arrogance as they 
do in the government. They think that because of who they are they can get away 
with anything, including murder." 
</P>
<P>
The show, with music by Charles Strouse and lyrics by Richard Maltby, is to go 
into rehearsal in March for a Broadway opening next summer, Laurents said. 
</P>
<P>
PHANTOM OF ANAHEIM: An official of the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim finally 
broke a week of silence -- sort of -- about last week's reports in The Times on 
the cancellation of Ken Hill's "The Phantom of the Opera" (not to be confused 
with Andrew Lloyd Webber's version). 
</P>
<P>
"I have no comment," said Nick Masters, the Celebrity's booking manager. The 
theater had advertised the show and sold tickets without the producer's 
authorization. Masters refused to confirm or deny that $100,000 in tickets had 
been sold, but he did confirm that refunds can be obtained at point of 
purchase.

THE DEBATE OVER JACKSON BROWNE'S 'WORLD IN MOTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mickey Baker's letter to the editor (July 15) regarding Randy Lewis' review of 
Jackson Browne's "World in Motion" (album) exemplifies the naivete that 
typifies today's rock-music fan. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, Baker's assertion that "rock 'n' roll has always been in 
the forefront of social change" is plain nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days, rock music's themes rarely strayed beyond those of teen-age 
lust, romance and good times. Just try to find a social message in "Great Balls 
of Fire," "Sweet Little Sixteen," "Surfin' Safari" and "I Want to Hold Your 
Hand." 
</P>
<P>
In reality, it wasn't until the '60s and its fusion with folk music that rock 
became the liberally biased social mouthpiece it is today. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the real point here. Baker, in her mindless idol worship of 
Jackson Browne, Sting and all the other musicians " . . . who have the guts to 
tell the truth . . . " fails to see that their "truth" is actually an extremely 
narrow interpretation of the facts surrounding the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than providing intelligent, balanced discourse on problems such as 
homelessness, pollution and world hunger, rock musicians pontificate about 
human indifference, cry out in self-righteous indignation against the evils of 
materialism and self-interest, and poetically plead for increased social 
spending and government intervention programs that rarely, if ever, make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Geldof's feed-the-world efforts were a perfect example of this. After all 
the hype and self-congratulation settled and all the money squandered, Geldof 
and his followers had to face the fact that it wasn't indifference or drought 
that kept Ethiopians in starvation, but Communist oppression and bankrupt 
socialism. Not surprisingly, the rock-music world seemed to miss this point 
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and others like her need to realize that the Jackson Brownes and Stings 
of the world have no more grasp on the truth than our government has on 
economic reality. 
</P>
<P>
If she is really concerned about social problems, Baker ought to search for the 
truth through books and periodicals and spend less time pondering the shallow 
poetics of boobs like Jackson Browne.

BATTLE IS STILL RAGING OVER VITAMIN-MINERAL SUPPLEMENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD S. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps no other subject arouses as much acrimony among nutritional authorities 
as vitamin and mineral supplementation. 
</P>
<P>
Firmly entrenched on one side are the skeptics who, like researchers at the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, call supplementation "a questionable and 
potentially harmful practice." On the opposing side stand the apologists, who 
claim that taking megadoses of vitamins and minerals can extend the life span 
and boost the body's immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Between these two extremes are the many nutritionists and physicians who 
cautiously endorse taking a daily multiple supplement with 100% of the 
Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) as "insurance" against nutritional 
deficiencies. The Food and Nutrition Board, the government agency that sets 
nutritional standards, defines the RDA as the amount of each nutrient necessary 
to keep most people in good health, based on available scientific knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"Supplementation may be warranted after age 50 because nutritional needs change 
and because the American fast-food diet makes it difficult to get complete 
nutrition," said Maryanne Painter, a dietitian for Health Care Pharmacies in 
San Diego. "You may be a candidate if you don't consume two servings of milk 
products daily, two servings of protein foods (such as lean red meat, fish and 
poultry), four serving of fruits and vegetables (one-half cup each) and four 
servings of starches, including cereals, breads and rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Supplements should not provide more than 100% of the RDA, she warned, because 
certain vitamins, such as Vitamins A and D, become toxic in excessively high 
concentrations. High doses of Vitamin A, for example, may cause blurred vision 
and headaches, while excesses of Vitamin D may cause vomiting and diarrhea, 
weight loss and muscular weakness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wholesome Food 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than megadosing on vitamins to make up for an inadequate diet, I 
recommend eating healthful, wholesome food and using vitamins as an adjunct to 
your diet," Painter said. "If you listen to your body and eat a varied diet 
that incorporates your favorite foods in moderation, as Hippocrates said, 'food 
will be your medicine.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some nutritionists, however, claim that given our present agricultural and 
food-processing systems, relying strictly on unsupplemented diets can only 
create nutritional deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
Getting adequate nutrition from food "was possible 100 or even 50 years ago, 
when all foods were grown on fertile soils, were unrefined, and unprocessed, 
and contained all the nutrients nature intended them to contain," writes Paavo 
Airola, a well-known nutritionist, in "The Holistic Health Lifebook." "But 
today, when soils are depleted, when foods are loaded with residues of hundreds 
of toxic insecticides and other chemicals, the addition of vitamins and food 
supplements to the diet is of vital importance. "Nutritionally inferior and 
poisoned foods of today cause many nutritional deficiencies, derangement in 
body chemistry, and lowered resistance to disease." 
</P>
<P>
Some nutritional authorities do not fault the food system itself, but people's 
lack of knowledge in balancing meals for adequate nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
"Satisfying the RDAs at the dinner table is a wonderful goal but unrealistic," 
said Paul Saltman, a University of California biology professor and author of 
"The California Nutrition Book." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Net 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you're a superb nutritionist and know how to balance foods to provide 
the essential micronutrients, you need supplements to act as a safety net to 
catch needs that fall through the dietary cracks." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, government studies of older men and women reveal that more than 
half get less than two-thirds of the RDAs for calories and several vitamins and 
minerals, he said. Common deficiencies of the aging include shortages of 
calcium and Vitamin D necessary to combat osteoporosis, the trace minerals zinc 
and iron, and essential B vitamins, such as thiamine, Folacin, B-6 and B-12. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if seniors consume 100% of the RDA, the figures established by the 
government may be inappropriate for them," Saltman said. "There is only one set 
of RDAs for all men and women over 50, yet there is substantial evidence that 
people's nutritional needs vary dramatically between 51 and 65 or 75." 
</P>
<P>
Nutrition-minded seniors intent on getting adequate amounts of key nutrients 
may encounter another problem: absorption. According to David Olson, a 
chiropractor in San Diego, many seniors have trouble absorbing calcium because 
they cannot produce sufficient stomach acid. Older adults also have trouble 
with Vitamin B-12 absorption, putting them at risk for pernicious anemia. 
</P>
<P>
As the digestive system becomes less efficient in later life, supplementation 
may help offset problems caused by decreased absorption, he said. But people 
also can make life style changes to aid the digestive process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eat Calmly 
</P>
<P>
"To increase absorption, it's important for people to eat calmly," he said, 
"otherwise digestion is hindered by anxiety. And people should chew their food 
throughly before swallowing, because an enzyme secreted in the mouth, ptyalin, 
begins to break down carbohydrates, facilitating digestion." 
</P>
<P>
Olson also recommends eating small, frequent meals throughout the day, easing 
the burden imposed on the digestive system. He also cautions taking fiber 
products -- such as oat bran, apple pectin and wheat bran -- apart from meals, 
because fiber blocks the absorption of certain key minerals. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors who use over-the-counter and prescription medication need to be 
especially conscious of food-drug interactions, which may deplete bodily stores 
of important nutrients, said Jerry Hammond, a pharmacist and president of the 
San Diego County Pharmacists Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Aspirin, for example, impairs assimilation of Vitamin C, he said. Mineral oils, 
found commonly in laxatives, decrease absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins, 
A, D, E and K. Diuretics deplete bodily stores of calcium, potassium, magnesium 
and zinc. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take medication that interferes with vitamin intake, a multiple 
supplement may help replenish depleted nutrients," Hammond said. "I recommend a 
supplement with 100% of the RDA, along with a calcium supplement to slow down 
the development of osteoporosis." 
</P>
<P>
Still, supplements cannot take the place of a well-balanced diet. 
</P>
<P>
Advised Roslyn Alfin-Slater, professor of nutrition at UCLA's School of Public 
Health: "Eat a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, get plenty of fruits, 
vegetables and whole grains, increase fiber consumption and drink eight glasses 
of fluid daily. Exercise the body and mind regularly, and in the process be 
sure to enjoy all the food that contributes to your health."

AUTHOR SHOWS HOW TO GET MOST THE MOST FROM PILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sigmund Miller, author of "LifeSpan Plus," offers the following advice on 
taking vitamin-mineral supplements: 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to inform your doctor. Certain vitamins interfere with the action of 
medications. L-dopa, used to treat Parkinson's disease, is reduced by taking 
Vitamin B-6. 
</P>
<P>
Take your supplements with or shortly after a meal. This ensures a higher rate 
of absorption of the micronutrients. 
</P>
<P>
Never gulp down a handful of pills with a glass of water and think of this as a 
meal. Always eat healthful, wholesome food, and use vitamins as adjuncts to 
your diet, not a substitute for it. 
</P>
<P>
Take vitamins and minerals in combinations that provide the complete range of 
nutritional substances. Vitamins and minerals work synergistically -- in 
combination with each other.

JOSEPH N. BELL: CRITIC, 11, GETS LAST WORD ON DISNEY WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have just emerged from Disneyland East -- four nights, three violent 
rainstorms, 100% humidity, at least 10 million people and a mixed bag of 
reactions at what is called, with disarming candor, Walt Disney World. That it 
is. 
</P>
<P>
I picked up my wife and the 11-year-old kid in my household at the airport in 
Miami. They flew; I drove. After spending two days with relatives in Miami -- a 
fairly dreadful city -- we drove to Orlando for the centerpiece of our trip -- 
four days with Uncle Walt Disney. We arrived shortly after noon and spent the 
first afternoon and evening at the just-opened Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park. 
The next three days were divided between Epcot Center and the Magic Kingdom 
Park, which is Florida-ese for what is known in Anaheim as Disneyland. My most 
vivid recollection of Disney-MGM is that sometime during our 45-minute wait to 
get on "The Great Movie Ride," which starts in a pale replica of Hollywood's 
Mann's Chinese Theatre, it occurred to me that in the same amount of time at 
home I could drive in to see the real thing. Oh, well. I must say that I found 
Disney's version of Hollywood Boulevard -- a gauzy, Midwestern fantasy 
rendering -- a lot more pleasant than the one in California. 
</P>
<P>
The two major attractions at MGM-Disney are "The Great Movie Ride" and the 
"Backstage Studio Tour." The former makes use of remarkably well-crafted 
robotic figures of Hollywood luminaries to dramatize a history of the movies. I 
found it interesting and ingenious. The "Backstage Tour" seems to me modeled 
rather shamelessly on the Universal Tour in Los Angeles and not as good. 
Probably the high spot of MGM-Disney was dinner in a restaurant called the 50s 
Prime Time Cafe where a TV set at your table plays excerpts from old sitcoms 
(the tape is much too short, repeating itself several times during dinner), 
while the menu favors the Disney conception of Mom's old favorites. It works 
pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic Kingdom -- with a few not particularly notable exceptions -- is a 
clone of Disneyland. The biggest difference lies in the surroundings. Where the 
compactness of Disneyland is accentuated by the parking lots and jungle of 
motels that surround it, Florida's Magic Kingdom -- built on exactly the same 
scale -- gives the impression of spaciousness because it is surrounded by 
spacious grounds and water. A ferry boat has to deliver you from the parking 
lot to the gates of the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Once you are inside the park, the contrast with Disneyland is minimal. The 
Magic Kingdom has Liberty Square in place of the New Orleans portion of 
Disneyland, and there are several rides that are different. Otherwise, you 
could just as well be at Disneyland. Our principal adventure there was a 
violent rainstorm that hyped the sale of Disney-packaged ponchos ($3.50 for 
adults, $3 for kids) and soaked us quite thoroughly. The rain was persistent 
enough to cancel the fireworks and electrical parade and send us back to our 
hotel squeezing water out of our shoes at every step. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural centerpiece of Walt Disney World is Epcot Center, and we spent the 
bulk of our time there. More than anything else, Epcot reminded me of a rather 
constricted copy of some of the world fairs I've attended. It is divided into 
two distinct parts: the World Showcase and Future World. The former consists of 
11 national pavilions (including the United States) showcasing the glories and 
the foodstuffs of each country. The latter is a series of gee-whiz natural and 
technological marvels of yesterday, today and tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
In general, I found the technological exhibit, including the Journey Through 
Imagination, surprisingly unimaginative, and the national pavilions 
surprisingly superficial -- architectural facades that front mostly for shops 
and frequently good restaurants. (We had our best meal at the French pavilion.) 
But Epcot is so pleasantly spacious that you seldom feel the press of humanity 
except in the omnipresent lines for Future World rides. 
</P>
<P>
A few random notes jotted down at Epcot: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The best ride is General Electric's Horizons, and the most disappointing is 
General Motors' Motion, which starts out smashingly and then degenerates into a 
GM commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the U.S. pavilion, the choice of Americans quoted in large block letters 
on the wall is fascinating. They include Ayn Rand, Charles Lindbergh, Sam 
Walter Foss, Wendell Willkie, Althea Gibson and Walter Elias Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The rides finally fuzz into an amorphous whole to the point where we were 
saying, "Well, we can check that one off; now what's next?" 
</P>
<P>
A word should be said about prices. We were amply forewarned that Disney World 
would be outrageously expensive. It isn't -- at least to those accustomed to 
Orange County, Calif., prices -- if you exercise a little judgment about where 
and how you eat. The theme parks are expensive, especially if you buy a single 
day's admission. Four- or five-day passes are the best way to go (Disney no 
longer sells a three-day pass since the Studio park opened). The four-day pass 
costs $97 for adults and $77 for kids. But the biggest expense -- at least for 
Californians -- is getting there. 
</P>
<P>
If all this sounds a bit jaundiced, I must admit I was often overpowered by the 
almost oppressive commercialism of the place from the 50 cents we were charged 
in our hotel for each credit card call to the plastic ponchos with the Disney 
label to the hundreds of stores and stands relentlessly pushing Disney 
artifacts. The spaciousness and beauty of the place and the variety of things 
to do is attractive, but I feel strongly that I've made my lifetime trip to 
Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old kid, suspecting I would take such an approach, would like to 
enter a demurrer. He was enchanted, rushing from ride to ride with the 
dedication and energy and unquestioned acceptance of fantasy -- even badly done 
-- endemic to youth. He wants the readers of this column to know that Walt 
Disney World is a wonderfully exciting place. And it seems right and proper 
that he should have the last word.

13,000 PEOPLE A YEAR DO SO AT NATIONAL ARCHIVES IN LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least once a week for the past 10 years, Lois Salmans' search for her 
ancestors has taken her from her Newport Beach home to a massive, 
pyramid-shaped building nestled in the hills of Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
There, in the National Archives on the first floor of the seven-tiered Chet 
Holifield Building, Salmans spends nearly eight hours glued to a microfilm 
reader, poring over names in federal census schedules dating back to 1790. 
</P>
<P>
After all these years, Salmans has still not grown tired of her quest for the 
descendants of James Chichester, her immigrant ancestor who landed in Salem, 
Mass., in 1640. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, good heavens, no," said Salmans, 66. "I just hope I live long enough to 
finish what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
Salmans is one of the more than 50 people a day -- about 13,000 a year -- who 
do research at the Pacific Southwest regional branch of the National Archives. 
Like Salmans, the majority of patrons are working on their family trees. 
</P>
<P>
But whether they are genealogists, biographers, scholars, lawyers, 
environmentalists, social historians or students, if it's federal documents 
they want to peruse, they've come to the right place. 
</P>
<P>
The regional archives is a virtual treasure trove of historical documents -- a 
repository for everything from territorial Arizona court records to a cache of 
Richard Nixon's pre-presidential papers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the treasures to be found among the archives' stacks are: 
</P>
<P>
A copy of a letter from then-Vice President Nixon to Nikita Khrushchev, the 
Soviet Union's Council of Ministers chairman, inquiring about the fate of 11 
missing men aboard a C-130 U.S. Air Force transport aircraft shot down over 
Soviet Armenia in 1958. "It is impossible for the American people to believe," 
Nixon wrote, "that these 11 crew members disappeared without a trace and that 
nothing is known about them by the Soviet authorities. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Pilot Chuck Yeager's notes from his flight breaking the sound barrier in 1947 
over what is now Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Errol Flynn's 1946 registration for his yacht Zaca. It certifies that Flynn 
will use the boat for pleasure, which the legendary Lothario underscored by 
having the word pleasure typed in capitals followed by five exclamation points. 
</P>
<P>
The regional archives, which include material from federal agencies in Southern 
California, Arizona and Clark County, Nev., houses more than 17,000 cubic feet 
of original records. That's not to mention documents on 48,000 rolls of 
microfilm spanning everything from Revolutionary War military service records 
to immigration arrival records. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of paper work produced by federal agencies over the years is 
staggering, and the National Archives in Laguna Niguel is one of 11 regional 
branches where the most historically and informationally significant material 
winds up for safekeeping (related story, Page 6). 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if the Smithsonian Institution is the nation's attic, the National 
Archives is the nation's filing cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
The federal agency prefers to call itself "the nation's memory." 
</P>
<P>
"To me, 'filing cabinet' sounds more like it's closed and people can't use it, 
and really the drawer is open," said Diane Nixon, archives regional director. 
"We like to think of the 'filing cabinet' as being accessible and open to 
everybody. And we want people to know this exists." 
</P>
<P>
The National Archives, at 24000 Avila Road, is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. 
Monday through Friday and on the first Saturday of each month for microfilm 
research only. 
</P>
<P>
All 11 regional archives opened in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically every (federal) agency has regional offices so they might as well 
keep those records in the region so they can be used by that agency and 
researchers in that area," said Nixon, regional director since 1984. "Our motto 
is, 'You don't have to go to Washington to visit the National Archives.' " 
</P>
<P>
The National Archives-Pacific Southwest Region and the Los Angeles Federal 
Records Center moved into the Chet Holifield Building from an unsafe and 
deteriorating facility in Bell in 1975. (The 1.5-million-square-foot building, 
known as the "Ziggurat" because of its resemblance to an ancient Babylonian or 
Assyrian temple, also houses offices of the Internal Revenue Service, 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Geological Survey and other 
federal agencies.) 
</P>
<P>
The National Archives is housed on the same floor as the Federal Records 
Center, which currently stores more than 600,000 cubic feet of non-current 
records for federal agencies. Federal agencies are not required to store their 
documents in the Records Center, but Nixon said most do so because it is the 
most cost-effective way of keeping them. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-seven percent of the documents in the Records Center will ultimately be 
disposed of; only 3% -- those records deemed "permanently valuable" by 
archivists -- will be transferred to the National Archives. 
</P>
<P>
Still, that's about 500 to 700 cubic feet of records a year. (One cubic-foot 
storage box, according to Nixon, will hold about 3,000 sheets of paper.) 
</P>
<P>
The National Archives has the atmosphere of a library -- without books. 
</P>
<P>
The public portion of the archives includes a glass-enclosed textual research 
room where researchers can examine original documents, some dating back to 
1851. Next to it is the microfilm research room, which has 40 microfilm readers 
for examining copies of records deposited in the National Archives building in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
To view original records, researchers are advised to make an appointment at 
least one week in advance. Although researchers are responsible for conducting 
their own research, an archivist brings the records into the room and is 
available for assistance. To protect the records, no record may be removed from 
the room, and researchers may bring in only a pen or pencil, writing paper and 
essential reference books. An archival technician also is present at all times. 
So far, no one has been caught attempting to steal any records. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been fortunate," said Nixon, "but we'll always have someone looking over 
your shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Because Hollywood falls under the regional archives' domain, famous names 
regularly crop up among its holdings of original material -- so much so that, 
according to assistant director Suzanne Dewberry, "we're fondly known as the 
Hollywood branch." 
</P>
<P>
Searching through the files for a planned "Hollywood at the Archives Exhibit," 
Dewberry found yacht registrations for Johnny Weissmuller, Hal Roach, Paulette 
Goddard, Lou Costello, Dana Andrews, Humphrey Bogart, John Barrymore, James 
Cagney and Errol Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
The most fascinating movie star documents, however, are the declarations of 
intention for naturalization, many of which contain black-and-white mug shots. 
There are records for Ladislav Lowenstein (Peter Lorre), Archibald Leach (Cary 
Grant), Alfred Hitchcock, Bela Lugosi, Eric Von Stroheim, Victor McLaglin, 
Reginald Alfred Jones (Ray Milland) and Flynn. Perhaps the most intriguing 
original material, however, is Richard Nixon's pre-presidential papers 
(1948-1964). Nixon deeded most of the 400 linear feet of material to the 
federal government just before he became President, and it was transferred to 
the regional archives in the mid-'70s while he was living in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the documents cover Nixon's vice presidential period, from 1953 
to 1961. Correspondence files include copies of every letter Nixon sent out and 
every letter he received. Represented are Nikita Khrushchev, Warren E. Burger, 
John Foster Dulles, Gerald Ford, Barry Goldwater, Dwight Eisenhower, Chiang 
Kai-shek, Willy Brandt, Omar Bradley, Jimmy Hoffa and Eleanor Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the material stored in the archives is on paper, however. 
</P>
<P>
Dewberry said the archives occasionally receives court exhibits that are 
considered permanently valuable, such as zippers used that were part of a 
patent dispute, engine parts and money. 
</P>
<P>
The archives even stored a set of former President Gerald Ford's golf clubs 
until his presidential library was built. 
</P>
<P>
Microfilm holdings include military service, pension and land records relating 
to the Revolutionary War, the Index to the Compiled Service Records of 
Confederate Soldiers, immigration and passenger arrival records, land records 
and Indian records -- all of which are invaluable to people tracing their 
family histories. 
</P>
<P>
They also have microfilmed minutes and dockets of the U.S. Supreme Court from 
1790 to 1950 and records of the U.S. chief counsel for the Nuremberg war crimes 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
But the majority of the archives' 48,000 microfilm rolls are federal population 
censuses from 1790 to 1910. (The censuses are not open to the public for 72 
years; the 1920 census won't be available until 1992.) 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the interesting individuals who crop up in the censuses, 
Dewberry showed a copy of the 1900 Census featuring the Marks family from the 
borough of Manhattan. Listed are the father, Samuel; mother, Minnie; and five 
children, Pauline, Leo, Adolph, Julius and Milton. Brief biographical 
information shows that Samuel Marks was a tailor, that his mother-in-law, Fanny 
Schonberg, lived with the family and that all the children were in school. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't mention, however, that the Marks boys will later change the spelling 
of their last name and gain worldwide fame as Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo 
Marx. 
</P>
<P>
Off limits to the public -- and behind a combination-locked security door -- is 
the stack area of the National Archives and the Federal Records Center: a 
massive warehouse filled with row upon row of eight-foot-tall metal shelves. 
(The 8,400-square-foot Archives stack area is dwarfed by the 
214,000-square-foot Records Center.) 
</P>
<P>
Some records arrive at the National Archives in bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
Dewberry and Nixon said they have heard of records being found stored in 
chicken coops and root cellers on Indian reservations. Records also 
occasionally arrive severely damaged by water and bugs. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the damage bugs can do to valuable historical records, 
Dewberry pulled a 1900 Arizona court record book from the shelf which appeared 
to be in excellent condition except for a few tiny holes in the heavy cardboard 
cover where bugs had bored in. Opening the cover, Dewberry revealed that the 
bugs had chewed a maze of holes throughout the record book's pages. 
</P>
<P>
While most records arrive at the regional archives in good condition, Nixon 
said virtually every record is on acidic paper and "anything that contains acid 
ultimately will deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
Once documents arrive at the archives, the archival staff arranges them, writes 
a description of each record for a computerized listing and does preservation 
work: Documents are stored in acid-free folders and boxes and are kept in a 
temperature-controlled environment of 60 to 70 degrees and 40% to 50% humidity. 
</P>
<P>
As director for the past five years, Nixon acknowledged an affinity for the old 
documents under her care. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important to preserve historical materials," she said. "The 
National Archives is the nation's memory. We play an important part in 
preserving that memory, and I think that's extremely worthwhile. And you see 
the numbers of people who come here all the time, and I think they share my 
feelings for the records." 
</P>
<P>
Lois Salmans does. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the day I pick daisies, I call it, the day I do what I want to do," 
she said, taking a break in her microfilm search for the husband of a 
19th-Century relative whose maiden name was Katherine Waring. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely is exciting," she said. "I tell you I'm going to go through the 
ceiling when I find out who her husband is and what his connection is to 1640." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AMONG THE BEST FINDS IN LAGUNA NIGUEL'S NATIONAL ARCHIVES 
</P>
<P>
The National Archives-Pacific Southwest Region in Laguna Niguel stores original 
records from 27 different federal agencies in Southern California, Arizona and 
Clark County, Nevada. Among the highlights are: 
</P>
<P>
Bureau of the Land Commissioners' docket books, which list California rancho 
land decrees. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona territorial court records. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court rolls of attorneys, which list the names of attorneys who 
were certified to practice before federal judges. Among the original signatures 
is that of William Howard Taft before his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Indian records. The largest holdings are correspondence from the commissioner 
of Indian affairs to the superintendents of the various Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard and Customs records, including unit logs for vessels beginning in 
1971, official merchant marine vessel log books, and yacht registrations. 
</P>
<P>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration records. 
</P>
<P>
11th Naval District records, which include the administrative correspondence 
files for San Diego and San Pedro-Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Army Corps of Engineers records from 1898 to 1935, including the original plans 
and survey notes for the development of Ft. Pio Pico and Ft. MacArthur.

PHOTOGRAPHY: AFRICAN SAFARIS CHALLENGE THE ABILITY TO PREPARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost everyone likes to take photographs of animals, but after awhile they do 
start to look the same. After all, how many pictures can you get of a bear 
waving as the tour bus goes by? 
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, you may be ready for the next plateau -- an African 
safari. 
</P>
<P>
The price -- $2,500 to $4,000 -- may be an obstacle for most, but the adventure 
behind it is certainly appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Those who decide to take an African safari should know that shooting Kodachrome 
slides of elephants and lions in their natural habitats can't be done well 
without proper advance planning and research. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people think that going to Africa is like going to the San Diego Zoo," 
said Bob Greenburg, a nature photographer and Newport Beach 
obstetrician-gynecologist who is planning his fifth trip to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"It is totally a misconception because wild animals are unique. They are alert, 
alive, they have personality, they look at you and they interact with you. 
Animals that are in a zoo, like any captive creature, have their spirit broken 
and are nervous and circle their cages. 
</P>
<P>
"African animals in the wild have to be alert because if they're not, they're 
lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few of Greenburg's recommendations for a successful safari: 
</P>
<P>
Selecting a tour -- The best tour operator is one who comes recommended by a 
friend or someone that has been on a recent safari. Don't be misled by 
brochures making grandiose claims. Some of the better operators may be a little 
more expensive, but the extra money will probably greatly increase your 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
You should find out how many people will be in each van. The tour companies 
usually have mini-vans that seat nine people, which, with luggage, can be a 
tight fit. The maximum should be four or five. 
</P>
<P>
Professional photographers leading the tour -- If there is a professional 
photographer leading the trip, check his or her references. You will be paying 
for his trip to Africa, so he can take photographs to fill his stock files. Be 
sure the references are from a recent trip. Ask if the photographer caters to 
both beginning and advanced shooters. The photographer should help you with 
your pictures so when you come home the results are worthy of your investment 
in the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment -- For the average traveler, Greenburg recommends a wide-angle lens, 
28- or 35-millimeter up to a telephoto lens of 300-mm. at the minimum. For 
animal photography, a 400-mm. lens is best. 
</P>
<P>
A bean bag or a Steady Bag is a great way of steadying the camera and lens on 
the van. Trying to use a tripod while shooting through the roof of the van 
becomes awkward. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't wish to carry a Steady Bag should take an empty bean bag with 
them and at the first market fill it with dried rice, beans or peas and use it 
as a camera support. After the safari give the rice or beans to your driver. 
Food is very expensive and will be appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Always take an extra camera body along. The African dust can ruin the moving 
parts of your camera. 
</P>
<P>
Film -- Double the amount of film you originally plan to take. Greenburg shoots 
mostly Kodak's Kodachrome 64-slide film. He also shoots a lesser amount of 
Kodachrome 200 for low-light situations. He takes the film out of the box, puts 
it into a sealed plastic bag and has it hand-examined at the airports, making 
sure it is not put through X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to pace yourself. A rule of thumb is four rolls of 36 exposures 
a day when shooting in the national parks. Greenburg says he has shot up to 25 
rolls in one day at a lodge where a herd of elephants was approaching the water 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations -- Tour operators offer accommodations ranging from very nice 
lodges at the national parks with all the comforts to tents. 
</P>
<P>
Mosquitoes -- They are probably the only insects you'll have to worry about. 
Most of the camps and lodges at night provide mosquito protection and spray the 
rooms at sundown. 
</P>
<P>
Medicine -- Greenburg recommends taking protective products for the eyes and 
lips. You may also need medication for sore throats, sunburn and scrapes. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations -- Reservations should be made at least six months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Mornings -- You usually wake up at 5:30 a.m. and have coffee at 6 a.m. You then 
drive to the game preserves until 8:30 a.m., stopping when you see animals. 
</P>
<P>
The Safari -- In game parks it's a law that you have to stay in the vans. 
Animals view you as no threat when you're in a van. The drivers are specially 
trained for these situations. Some of the game lodges offer bunkers or verandas 
from which to shoot. They can give you a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting Photographs -- The experience of shooting pictures is phenomenal. It's 
an unbelievable feeling when you look through your camera at a lion roaring in 
your face. Using a fast shutter speed such as 1/250 or faster can greatly 
improve your nature shots. Also try to shoot a highlight in the animal's eye, 
which can make a photograph come to life. Without this, the animal might as 
well be stuffed in a museum. 
</P>
<P>
Also drape a focusing cloth over your head and the camera to enhance your 
ability to focus accurately in the bright sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Don't overextend yourself, because fatigue can make you rush your photographs 
and cause you to get careless with focus and composition. Select a tour with 
fewer parks so you'll be able to get more detail at each stop. Remember, 
patience is a virtue while on safari. 
</P>
<P>
Natives -- Try to establish a rapport with people you want to photograph. 
Introduce yourself and ask their names. Don't just stick a camera in their face 
and start snapping. Many times the natives will ask to have a photograph sent 
back to them. Rarely do people ever keep their promise. So, Greenburg takes 
along a Polaroid camera and just gives them that picture. 
</P>
<P>
Music -- Most of the gift shops at the lodges sell recorded music of the local 
tribes. Consider buying a cassette for background music for your slide show 
when you return. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations -- Greenburg's favorite park is Mountain Lodge at Mount Kenya 
National Park in Kenya. It's an opportunity to be in a beautiful rustic 
building overlooking a water hole and salt lick. 
</P>
<P>
It has an underground viewing bunker or you can shoot from the balcony of your 
room or the roof of the hotel. It also has some rarely seen animals such as 
bush pigs and giant forest hogs in addition to elephants, cape buffalo, 
antelope and gazelles. 
</P>

Another favorite is the Mara Serena Lodge at Masai Mara National Park in Kenya. 
It was built as a replica of a Masai tribe's village, but with all the 
amenities of a resort.

Q. Recently, I went to the optical department of a store to have my 
prescription lenses replaced. Instead of purchasing new frames, I decided to 
use the old pair. After giving the store a check, I noticed that there was a 
disclaimer of responsibility on the receipt that said the store was not 
responsible for loss or damage to a frame provided by a patient. I asked the 
optician about this, but he told me not to worry because no frames had ever 
been lost. He said the disclaimer was there because the frames were sent to 
another place where the lenses were made. 
</P>
<P>
Can the store make such a disclaimer of responsibility? What happens if the 
optician intentionally throws my frames away? Would the store have no 
responsibility? This hardly seems fair! 
</P>

A. The relationship that you have with the store is called a bailment. A 
bailment is when a person deposits personal property with another under an 
agreement or a contract for a specific purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The general rule is that the bailee (the person who receives the property) must 
use the same care that an ordinary prudent person would toward his property. 
</P>
<P>
The general rule, however, can be changed by an agreement between the parties 
such as the one you have described. This agreement would basically protect the 
bailee from liability for simple negligence. The bailee would still be 
responsible for fraud or intentional injury to property.

Q. I have been sick for the last three months and have been unable to work. I 
spoke to the manager of my apartment building and explained my problem with 
paying the rent. He said he understood, and that I didn't have to worry because 
I had always paid on time before. 
</P>
<P>
You can imagine how shocked I was when I got the eviction papers! I tried to 
talk to the manager, but he said he would see me in Municipal Court in Santa 
Ana. I want to fight this because I feel I was tricked. 
</P>
<P>
I understand that I have to pay a fee to file papers in my defense. What 
happens if I can't afford this fee? 
</P>

A. You may avoid paying the fee for filing what is known as an answer if you 
are receiving assistance from certain types of governmental programs such as 
Food Stamps and County Relief. You may also be eligible for the waiver of the 
fee if your gross monthly income is less than the amount contained in a 
schedule kept by the Municipal Court. The amount varies depending upon the 
number of your dependents. Waiver may also be obtained if your income is 
inadequate to pay for both the fee and for support of you and your dependents. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk's office in the Santa Ana Municipal Court has an information sheet 
that contains the court's schedule and lists the requirements for obtaining the 
waiver. The clerk's office will also have the forms you must complete in order 
to apply for the waiver.

Q. Our 19-year-old son pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense of 
shoplifting. He had never been in trouble before and was told to pay a fine. He 
was also given something called informal probation. What is this? 
</P>
<P>
CW, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
A. Informal probation is a type of probation where the defendant is given 
certain terms and conditions to obey as part of his sentence. It differs from 
formal probation in that there is no probation officer to whom the defendant 
reports. The defendant, instead, reports to the court upon whatever terms the 
court may direct. 
</P>
<P>
If the defendant violates the conditions of his probation, e.g., by not paying 
the fine, the court can impose additional penalties on the defendant.
