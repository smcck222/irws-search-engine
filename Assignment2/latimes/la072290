BRODERICK MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under a bill (AB 2613) proposed by Assemblyman Jerry Eaves (D-Rialto), a woman 
who commits premeditated murder, shooting her husband in his sleep, would be 
entitled to go free if she could claim to have been a victim of battered 
women's syndrome. Similarly, a woman who kills her child may now defend a 
murder charge by pleading postpartum psychosis. 
</P>
<P>
Women who abuse their husbands ought to be arrested and forced into a treatment 
program for female batterers. Unfortunately, there are no such programs in 
California. Our state has adopted radical, feminist policies that see men as 
inherently violent and marriage as inherently demeaning to women. The feminist 
party line says only men can be capable of initiating violence within the 
family. As long as the California Legislature continues to enact 
domestic-violence laws based on these flawed assumptions, real solutions to the 
problem of female violence against men will remain elnusive.

<TEXT>
<P>
As an RN student who just finished my psych rotation at the county 
mental-health facility, I did not find it surprising that someone as troubled 
as Mrs. Broderick got through the system only to carry out the murders. 
</P>
<P>
A 72-hour hold on someone so disturbed is not enough. Time after time I saw 
patients released who were violent when brought in and who weren't ready to 
leave after only 72 hours. I've always wondered if the paranoid schizophrenic 
who was my case study ever got around to harming someone. The ACLU may have had 
good intentions when they overhauled the mental-health system in the 1960s, but 
they really blew it.

Betty Broderick is a pathetic, vindictive and psychotic ex-wife who deserves to 
be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, including the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Not a soul should shed a tear for this cold-blooded and deranged killer. The 
only sympathy I feel is for her badgered and verbally abused children, who bore 
the brunt of her tantrums over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Dan and Linda Broderick were never allowed to begin their new life together. 
And Betty stands to pay the price.

I was saddened by Wallace's story on the Broderick marriage and its tragic 
consequences -- but not surprised. It is too bad that a woman allowed herself 
to assume complete control of rearing her children while encouraging her 
husband to be the sole financial support of the family. The duties of either of 
these roles are enough to make anyone crazy.

In your June 24 Movies of the Week column, Kevin Thomas wrote "While the 1934 
version of 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' is entertaining in its own right, it is 
of most interest in revealing how Hitchcock improved upon himself in the 1956 
remake." 
</P>
<P>
As author of the film's story with my name on both the original and the remake, 
I have to differ with Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of color and heavy expenditure, I found the remake to be a muddled 
mishmash of what had once been a good film. Star-studded though it was, it came 
out as just a pathetic shadow of the original. Hitchcock shared my view. In 
1958 he said to me, "Redoing that film was the greatest error of my life, but I 
learned my lesson -- never remake a classic."

<P>
It was with a heavy heart that I began the article on Linda and Dan Broderick, 
"Till Murder Do Us Part," by Amy Wallace (June 3). Many others have missed the 
mark, trying to rationalize Betty's actions. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time I finished, I knew that Wallace had gotten it right. Betty 
refused to get on with her life despite generous alimony and every conceivable 
advantage. Larry Broderick is also right: It was cold-blooded murder. 
</P>
<P>
The terror and havoc Betty caused were obvious at key times in Linda's and 
Dan's lives, and yet they carried on with grace, good cheer and love for each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Linda's devotion to Dan and the children in spite of Betty's horrible verbal 
and physical attacks has left a lasting impression on those of us who had the 
pleasure of knowing her. Linda had to have lived in great fear for herself and 
Dan yet stayed with Dan to the end. 
</P>
<P>
Two very special people are gone and four children's lives savagely altered 
because of Betty's calculated vendetta. As a society, we have got to find a way 
for spoiled people like Betty to get through a divorce short of destroying 
their families.

My soul, mind and heart go out to Betty Broderick. I have been in her position 
as far as the kind of betrayal she has endured by her husband, the courts, 
judges, lawyers, her own family and cronies of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows or understands this kind of situation until they have been through 
it. I am totally 100% in Betty Broderick's corner.

OUTTAKES: STALLONE'S CHALLENGE

<TEXT>
<P>
If producer David Brown can get "The Midnight Club" going, co-producer 
Sylvester Stallone will star as New York's best detective -- in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie will have state-of-the-art, wheelchair, hand-to-hand combat," Brown 
tells us. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about a New York police detective determined to extinguish a crime 
overlord. . . . In his single-minded desire to wipe out this man, the detective 
is paralyzed from the waist down and almost killed. 
</P>
<P>
"Stallone goes from a man of intense activity to a wheelchair, and the action 
continues from the wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
The script, by John Herzfeld, is based on a book by James B. Patterson, former 
CEO of the J. Walter Thompson USA ad agency. The movie, to be financed by 
Stallone's Carolco Pictures as a Tri-Star release, is expected to start 
shooting early next year. First up for Stallone: the comedy "Oscar," which 
begins shooting this fall. Daniel Cerone

Some critics took shots at Warren Beatty's performance as straight-laced cop 
"Dick Tracy," complaining that he paled alongside the big-budget, effects-laden 
picture's colorful villains. 
</P>
<P>
For his follow-up film, Beatty may have a prescription for those critical 
ailings: He trades in his machine gun for a stethoscope to star in "The 
Doctor," which a Disney spokeswoman calls "an intimate, character-driven 
drama." 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to begin shooting in the fall on a "moderate budget" for Disney's 
Touchstone Pictures, "The Doctor" has Beatty as a successful doctor and family 
man who is himself hospitalized, getting a patient's-eye view of his 
profession, and reassessing his own bedside manner.

FOR TODAY'S BRIDE blushing about the state of our environment, there's a 
floor-length paper wedding gown decorated with such recyclables as grocery-bag 
flowers and dental floss. Made of non-woven interfacing and trimmed with stuff 
most people consider trash -- coffee filters, Q-tips, tin-foil -- the dress 
looks like a real wedding gown. 
</P>
<P>
The paper wedding dress is a creation of bridal-designer Susan Lane, a 20-year 
veteran of the "I do" business. 
</P>
<P>
Lane's most recent nuptials creation was designed to draw attention to 
recycling. "A bridal dress represents the most beautiful thing a woman can 
wear. My dress shows you can use trash to make something beautiful." But trash 
doesn't come cheap. Lane's dress for environment-conscious brides sells for 
about $180 plain; additional decoration by Lane herself runs $100 to $600.

RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 THE TIME "PANDEMONIUM" PAISLEY PARK/REPRISE: ALBUMS ARE

Billed as "the return of the magnificent seven," this reunion album from the 
Twin Cities funk-rock fusionaries almost lives up to such hype-hopes. And why 
not? The main reason the group broke up was that there were simply too many 
talented people in it -- among them singer Morris Day, who went on to have 
several solo hits, and keyboardist Jimmy Jam and bassist Terry Lewis, who 
became a mega-platinum production team. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, they're all back for this flipped disc, and if they don't really add 
too much new to their signature sound, well it's only because 'twas all so 
plu-bleepin'-perfect in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The single "Jerk Out" and the title track are super-fine examples, with Day 
jes' talkin' trash. Scheming, flattering, transparent trash. Sexy, funny, 
endlessly tongue-in-cheek trash. 
</P>
<P>
Mean-wild, back at the raunch, the band plays its collective bootissimus 
maximus off. While "It's Your World" comes straight from the all-night 
funkadelicatessen with a message of self-determination, "Blondie" and 
especially the cast-iron "Skillet" rawk! the listener gently, gently with a 
chain saw. All of which proves there's no Time like the right Time, and, baby, 
the right Time is here 'n' now. DON WALLER

RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 SHINEHEAD "THE REAL ROCK" ELEKTRA: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A

Shinehead's 1988 debut album "Unity" placed the Jamaican-born, New York 
City-bred reggae rapper in the forefront of reggae's new generation and 
established him as one of the freshest young artists in any genre. His 
pastiches blended a wide array of sources and stances without slipping into 
forced eclecticism. 
</P>
<P>
"The Real Rock" is a mystifying follow-up because Shinehead has abandoned the 
panoramic sweep for a one-dimensional, electronic reggae/rap groove. Only the 
version of Sly Stone's "Family Affair" creates the excitement of never knowing 
what's going to come flying at you next. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining material just explores facets of Shinehead's sound one at a time. 
The skeletal foundations are catchy enough -- particularly the dynamic 
techno-roots groove to the Christian-themed title track -- but the gleeful 
embellishments that made "Unity" memorable are missing. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, there are lightweight novelties and facile exhortations to maintain a 
positive attitude. "Good Things" and the Everly Brothers' "Till I Kissed You" 
are more satisfying displays of Shinehead's singing skills in a '50s R&amp;B, 
innocent vein. But even the strongest songs are more well-crafted than 
inspirational, and the cleverest verbal forays are undercut by the musical 
retrenchment. DON SNOWDEN

TIM HAWKINSON -- MANIPULATING EVERYDAY OBJECTS AND NOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An American penny becomes a cobra snake with a long thin mass of copper 
stretched between the coin's "head" and "tail"; a nurse's cap becomes a 
mother's breast complete with a nipple sculpted from human hair; a crucifix 
becomes an old-fashioned scale, with the weights consisting of two bags of gold 
resembling figures in mourning; and an American flag becomes a literal 
black-and-white, stars-and-stripes image with the stars coming from a 
photograph of the night sky. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the works of mixed-media artist Tim Hawkinson, who manipulates 
everyday objects and the notions we hold about them to create a diverse body of 
artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the work comes from an investigation of social and personal views of 
the objects," said Hawkinson, who has a one-person show at Wilshire Boulevard's 
Ace Gallery through Saturday, and will be included in a three-person show 
opening at Santa Monica's Michael Kohn Gallery on Thursday (through Aug. 25). 
"There's just this kind of general urge to corrupt everyday objects that we 
find." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkinson, 29, works in a variety of mediums and says that he has no special 
trick to coming up with the diverse ideas. "I just use whatever medium is most 
suited to the ideas, but the ideas always come first" the soft-spoken, clean 
cut Hawkinson said, noting that he must sometimes "invent" objects to use as 
materials for his pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Hawkinson's pieces are romantic, such as a manipulated lunar calendar 
made of a 10-foot-long pearl necklace. Some refer directly to already existing 
artworks, such as the copy of Simone Martini's famous "Annunciation" painting 
that Hawkinson put onto an envelope so that the cancellation stamps became 
halos around the deities' heads. 
</P>
<P>
And still others are based on his own body. Three recent "self portraits," for 
instance, include a photographic collage of "the area I can not see in the 
periphery of my body," a cast lead sculpture of "the maximum mass I could get 
into my mouth," and a sculpture of the artist's legs where "the height of the 
sculpture was determined by (the amount of lead needed to equal) my body 
weight." 
</P>
<P>
But most of Hawkinson's pieces stand on their own, unrelated to other work he 
has done. An example seem during a recent trip to the artist's downtown studio 
-- which he shares with his painter wife Patty Wickman -- was a rather pretty 
rose window composed of medical slides from the pap smears of 300 women. The 
piece, Hawkinson explained, shows "the relationship of the (pap smears) to the 
history of the church and religion: There are two ways of seeing things, 
through the window and through the microscope." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkinson, who normally works on a number of pieces at one time, says he likes 
to keep variety in his work, which has "remained consistently inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
"I've avoided the idea of working in any kind of a series format," he says, 
noting that the variety helps him avoid falling into a formula and keeps his 
work more honest. "I'm much more interested in the ideas themselves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
Melrose Avenue's Cure Gallery is making its own contribution to the debate over 
"obscene" artworks and National Endowment for the Arts funding. Included in the 
gallery's current three-man show, called "Collaborative Views," is South 
Pasadena-based artist Theodore's 72-by-48-inch texturized acrylic painting 
depicting a large, erect penis. The work's title: "What Does Jesse (Helms) 
Want?" Also included in the show is Studio City-based artist Steve Montiglio's 
oil painting, "Helms Deep," which features two intermingled nude females. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first two weeks of September, cancel everything; just drop it now!" 
began L.A. Festival director Peter Sellars as he addressed an enthusiastic 
crowd of more than 100 members of the Fellows of Contemporary Art at its recent 
new members party. 
</P>
<P>
While Sellars' Pacific-themed festival doesn't officially begin until Sept. 1, 
the first two of the more than 25 visual art exhibitions included under its 
banner open this week. "Images of Faith: Religious Ivory Carvings From the 
Philippines" opens at Pacific Asia Museum today, and "Tongues of Flame," the 
first comprehensive exhibition of works by controversial New York artist David 
Wojnarowicz, goes on view Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Three emerging L.A. artists are hoping to make a go of it with a new art space 
opening up today in the downtown Santa Fe Artists Colony. Alan Blizzard, 
Richard Gerrish and Heidi Von Kann have joined together to form Millenium, 
which they have committed to run for one year and would like to open up to both 
visual and performance artists if adequate financial support can be found. 
</P>
<P>
As its first event, Millenium (at 2401 S. Santa Fe Ave., Studio 22) is holding 
a special $100-per-couple opening today from 2-5 p.m. to benefit the charity 
Vital Options. RSVP: (213) 587-5902. 
</P>

OVERHEARD 
</P>
<P>
"I probably have stuff around my house that would fit in this room," said a 
middle-aged woman in a black-and-green pantsuit as she glanced at the 
"funny-looking teapot" and other works in the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art's 20th-Century Ceramics room during one of the museum's special 25th 
Anniversary Member's Evenings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HAPPENING 
</P>

THE WATCH ON THE WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
German wines, the conventional wisdom says, are sweet and should be served with 
dessert. This inaccurate belief has left some of the best German wines 
languishing on store shelves and wine lists. Thus prices for the best of them 
haven't risen as fast as they would have in a more enlightened world. 
</P>
<P>
The wine list at Knoll's Black Forest is a happy surprise for the savvy wine 
buyer, laden with fine German wines that are dry and go well with food. Even 
better, their prices are very reasonable. Pricing, at between 2.0 and 2.5 times 
wholesale, is fair, with the German wines representing better value than the 
French or California wines. Most wines are between $20 to $30. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Knoll, son of the owners, has been responsible for the restaurant's wine 
list for three years. Although Knoll's has always had a large selection of 
German (and California wine), along with a smattering of French ones, Ronald 
has improved the German selection. 
</P>
<P>
It was a labor of love. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked in Germany for a year, for a restaurant in Munich, and I also did a 
seminar at the German Wine Academy in the Rheingau," he said, adding that he 
spoke German from childhood. 
</P>
<P>
He is now in the process of reorganizing the list to make it easier to use. 
"We're going to divide the wines not by region, but by sweetness," he said. 
Thus the driest wines (trocken and halb-trocken) will be listed first, and then 
the softer, sweeter wines (listed as "lieblich"). 
</P>
<P>
He was prompted to do this because a number of excellent Spaetlese Trocken 
wines on the list have been confusing to many people. "When people see the word 
spaetlese, they think sweet, because that word has always been translated as 
'late harvest,' which is technically accurate, and every California late 
harvest wine is sweet. But I have some Spaetlese wines that are trocken (dry), 
and all this means is you get a wine that is richer, fuller, with higher 
alcohol, maybe 11% to 12%. But it's dry." 
</P>
<P>
Knoll recommends the 1983 and 1986 German wines as good wines; the '83s because 
they were bought when the German mark was lower priced than it now is, and the 
'86s because they appear to be coming around faster than the marvelous 1985s. 
He said the 1987s and '88s had very high acidity and are good food wines. 
</P>
<P>
Knoll's also offers some interesting wines rarely seen in restaurants such as 
barrique-style wines like Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, and German Pinot Noir aged 
in small oak barrels. German red wines are lighter in color and style, and 
offer interesting aromas and flavors at reasonable prices. Look for important 
German names as Bert Simon, Fritz Haag and Robert Eymael.

THE BLACK FOREST WITH A PATIO; 
</P>
<P>
WITH GERMANY AT THE TOP OF THE NEWS, KNOLL'S SANTA MONICA ESTABLISHMENT -- THE 
AREA'S PREMIER GERMAN RESTAURANT -- RATES A VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When people talk about Germany these days they tend to natter on about such 
things as the impending unification of East and West, the place of a reunited 
Germany in the "new" Europe, and the future of the deutsche mark. That's all 
very well and good -- but, hey, let's not forget the important stuff: How's the 
food over there these days? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, which will surprise most Americans, is that it's often pretty good. 
German cooking has a reputation for being heavy, fatty, overstated. There's 
something to that, of course: This food is basically cold-weather stuff, full 
of the smoked, the salted and the pickled. 
</P>
<P>
But when German food is well-made, its inherent richness is modulated with 
acidity and with the haunting aromatic overtone of spices. Fresh fish, fruits, 
vegetables and other natural ingredients are greatly appreciated and 
imaginatively used in their proper seasons. Asparagus is practically a cult 
object in some corners of the country. German plums, apples and cherries are 
famous. There are superb oysters and sole from the North Sea coastline, and at 
least some salmon, of high quality, still swimming in the Rhine. Wild game and 
wild mushrooms flourish, and are treated with respect in German kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
And the top contemporary-minded chefs of Munich, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and even 
Berlin (never particularly famous for the refinement of its cooking) can make 
magic out of foie gras, truffles, lobster, lamb and pigeon. It is perhaps worth 
remembering that several of the best chefs in Los Angeles -- among them Joachim 
Splichal of Patina, Raimond Hofmeister of the Century Plaza Hotel and Hans 
Rockenwagner of Rockenwagner and Fama -- are German-born. (And then, of course, 
there's that Austrian kid named Puck.) 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, German food will probably never become a great fad in 
Southern California; we have neither the climate nor the historic temperament 
for it. But Los Angeles should certainly be able to support at least one or two 
good German restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Here is my imaginary picture of such a place: It is decorated warmly and 
rustically. Live plants and fresh flowers abound, and there is a little patio 
framed in greenery. The menu is small but appealing, offering a combination of 
traditional German dishes (smoked pork loin or kasseler Rippchen, Sauerbraten, 
roast goose, and the like), made with the finest products; a few lesser-known 
regional specialties; and perhaps a few contemporary German dishes. There is 
certainly a good choice of German beers, and a first-rate selection of 
Germany's excellent but sadly neglected and misunderstood wines. 
</P>
<P>
This hypothetical German restaurant, alas, is not Knoll's Black Forest Inn in 
Santa Monica. Knoll's is undeniably Los Angeles' premier German restaurant 
anyway. But, painted chests, stags' heads and an undeniably attractive patio 
aside, the chairs are covered in vinyl, there are tacky plastic-looking 
fixtures in the terrace room and the flowers and plants are mostly artificial. 
The menu does indeed offer traditional, regional and contemporary German 
dishes, but it's big, as if trying to be all things to all Germans, and 
occasionally includes such distinctly non-Teutonic specials as grilled ahi tuna 
with sun-dried tomato sauce. Worse, the cooking is regrettably inconsistent, 
and sometimes positively reactionary in its dullness. 
</P>
<P>
Only the wine and beer selection really fulfill the dream; Knoll's might well 
be the single most important restaurant in Los Angeles for real wine-lovers (as 
opposed to mere label-drinkers), offering a treasure trove of wonderful 
vintages all but unknown in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
Knoll's chef and co-owner Norbert Knoll is obviously skilled and experienced in 
the kitchen, and he obviously uses products of good quality (and, incidentally, 
makes his own sausages, sauerkraut, noodles and such). And sometimes his 
cooking is quite good, in a hearty, appealingly straightforward sort of way. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a special one evening was Lachsrahmsuppe, a creamy smoked salmon 
soup with green peppercorns and dill: convincingly modern-German in style and 
quite delicious. So was Feldsalat mit warmen Pilzen and geraucherter Forelle, a 
big salad of bruised mache with subtly smoked trout and sauteed mushrooms in a 
sweetish garlic dressing. Bratheringe, cold fried herring with marinated raw 
onions and lightly briny cucumber pickles, is a great warm-weather appetizer. 
Maultaschen, homemade Swabian-style ravioli filled with spinach and ground 
meat, are excellent in several different guises. Kalbsleber mit gerosteten 
Zweibeln und Apfelring (sauteed calf's liver with fried onions and apple rings) 
is tender and good. And though the various homemade sausages here tend to be 
underseasoned, the four different kinds offered, each at $13.50 per generously 
garnished plate (with soup or salad included), are a very good dinner deal. 
</P>
<P>
But then there's the verschiedene Lendchen or mixed grill, composed one night 
of dried-out little pieces of pork loin, veal and beef, plus some underdone 
bacon and some unusually bland Weisswurst. And the Sauerbraten, chewy and 
hardly sauer in the least, was accompanied by unpleasantly gummy potato 
pancakes. A Schwarzwaldplatte or Black Forest plate one day was 
</P>
<P>
merely middling, with decent Knackwurst, underseasoned Bratwurst, flavorless 
(though obviously homemade) Spatzle, and a piece of smoked pork loin that must 
have been sitting in the no-smoking section by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the dishes are perfectly all right but sort of boring -- for instance, 
the Rinderroulade, stuffed beef rolls with fried potatoes, red cabbage, and 
homemade applesauce. Others seem careless, as with a special one day of roast 
veal with morel mushrooms in which the veal tasted as if it had spent too long 
in the refrigerator and the morels had been either soaked or cooked in wine and 
still retained a dose of unevaporated alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts at Knoll's are honest but don't have much finesse: a big, frilly, 
buttery Black Forest cake, for instance, or an apple strudel in damp, gluey 
pastry. 
</P>
<P>
I hope Los Angeles one day gets a chance to experience German food at something 
approximating the quality it can have in Germany today. Norbert Knoll could 
probably provide this opportunity, but he doesn't -- at least not all the time. 
Simply by founding and building up his successful restaurant (with his wife 
Hildegard, who conscientiously oversees the dining room, as partner), he has 
probably fulfilled his own dream. He just hasn't yet fulfilled ours.

ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY?

<TEXT>
<P>
In his diatribe against rock's "rusty" stars, Hilburn manages to fault the 
artists, the fans, record companies and radio programmers. 
</P>
<P>
But wait a minute . . . what seems to be missing from that list? Critics, 
perhaps? Specifically, critics who continuously rattle out gushing reviews of 
the same old dinosaurs (Tyrannosaurus springsteen) while ignoring newer bands 
experimenting with newer rock forms. 
</P>
<P>
Rock has always been a medium that thrives on the energy of youth. Instead of 
the next installment of "Dear Bruce," why doesn't Hilburn use the space to 
explore the work of young artists, the ones who just might keep rock 'n' roll 
from rusting out completely?

Doesn't Hilburn (after all, it is his job) listen to musicians such as Eric 
Johnson, Jeff Healy, the Pretenders, Neil Young or Jeff Beck? There is great, 
exciting rock 'n' roll out there if one doesn't limit him/herself to popular FM 
air play.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hilburn, as usual, is right on the money. Searching the radio dial for anything 
remotely meaningful is a frustrating experience for anyone tired of oldies and 
the prefabricated snot that the under-20 crowd prefers now-adays. 
</P>
<P>
The death of rock as a vital form of popular music doesn't bother me, though. 
All things must pass, and rock has had its day. The depressing thing is that 
nothing is taking its place. 
</P>
<P>
We've had the Jazz Age, the Big Band Era, the Rock 'n' Roll Years. Since the 
turn of the century forms of popular music have left their marks on 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s will be very empty indeed if the only original means of musical 
expression is rap, which will never appeal to more than a small, angry 
minority.

ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a 16-year-old who likes classic rock, especially Paul McCartney's and 
David Bowie's. But I also enjoy such recent groups as Depeche Mode and Ziggy 
Marley. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a bad idea for David Bowie to vow to never sing any of his old hits 
in concert again. If I paid to see Bowie or McCartney or any other of the "10 
artists who should follow the lead of David Bowie," as stated in Hilburn's 
article, I would definitely want to see them perform some of their old, classic 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the recent works of these artists are great too. But what would a 
McCartney concert be without an old Beatles tune, or a Bowie concert without

ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago I came to the same conclusion as Hilburn's article -- rock was, 
indeed, running on empty. However, I got off my duff and began cruising the 
radio dial to see if it had changed coats and moved on, and by God -- I found 
it! 
</P>
<P>
Punk/alternative/new wave/college music or 
whatever-the-hell-you-want-to-call-it has single-handedly carried the rock 
flame through the '80s with all the imagination, guts, humor and passion of the 
original. 
</P>
<P>
Oingo Boingo, Midnight Oil, the Cure, Depeche Mode, Morrisey, Billy Idol and 
U2, among others, have each created a body of work that rivals any of the 
so-called legends of rock, and, remarkably, they've done it, for the most part, 
without Top 40-format radio. 
</P>
<P>
No, Robert, rock as a creative, exciting, fun, Mom-and-Dad-still-hate-it entity 
is not running on empty -- it just put on a little eye shadow and moved up the 
dial to 106.7 (KROQ).

ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why look to the same small set of artists and expect decade after decade of 
inspired work? Most now have families and (let's face it) financial empires to 
tend to. 
</P>
<P>
There is much vital new blood that is for the most part being kept locked out 
by the conservative business orientation of the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
It's no small wonder that we see an endless slew of Led Zeppelin caricature 
bands that are more interested in their hairdos and ancillary merchandising 
than the songs they write. 
</P>
<P>
The radio and record execs endlessly rehash the same tired formulas, and the 
bands (if they know what's good for them) get with the program. 
</P>
<P>
The reason that rap has proven so vital is simply that being a 
"non-market-tested genre," there was no old guard standing at the castle door.

OLMOS AS CROCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reference to your July 1 Outtakes item on actor Edward James Olmos playing 
the late inger Jim Croce: Will this start a new Hollywood fad? If so, why not 
Eddie Murphy as Abraham Lincoln? John Lone as Jack Kennedy? Or Cheech and Chong 
as the Wright Brothers? Since Olmos isn't required to sing, why not save Rob 
Lowe from obscurity and cast him, with a little heavy makeup, as Sammy Davis 
Jr.? 
</P>
<P>
I guess Hollywood figured casting an Italian-American actor to play an 
Italian-American like Croce might give them the idea they could play roles 
other than Mafia dons, pimply juveniles and oversexed buffoons. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, this would not gain Hollywood the same brownie points for its 
assumed liberalism as would choosing Mexican-American Olmos.

ROCK AS IT NEARS 40: RUNNING ON EMPTY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ho hum . . so Times pop critic Robert Hilburn suggests that rock is dead or 
dying (July 15 cover story, "Is Rock Running on Empty?"). 
</P>
<P>
Haven't we heard that before? Critics have been periodically writing rock's 
obituary since 1959 -- despite that rock has continued to grow in popularity 
and today has its largest worldwide following ever. 
</P>
<P>
Hilburn tends to overlook that from a creative standpoint rock is cyclic and at 
the present we are going through a stagnant period. Don't worry, Bobby, they'll 
write your obituary decades before they'll write rock's (and I am assuming 
you'll live to at least 100).

POLICEMAN TESTIFIES SEEING NO DRUGS ON BARRY VISIT 
</P>

<P>
A third member of Mayor Marion Barry's police protection unit testified at 
Barry's cocaine and perjury trial Friday that he saw no drugs on a trip to the 
Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Ulysses Walltower, a 20-year police veteran, said he saw no cocaine 
or other drugs used on a trip with Barry to St. Thomas in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Barry had gone there in connection with a personnel project that his city had 
with the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Barry's defense team called two other members of the Barry 
protective detail who said they saw no cocaine or other drugs used by Barry on 
that four-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
But as the other policemen testified, Walltower also said he was not in Barry's 
company every moment of the trip in a hotel or during a boat ride. 
</P>
<P>
A convicted drug dealer, Charles Lewis, testified at Barry's trial they used 
drugs in the Virgin Islands and four women also gave testimony to seeing drugs 
there. 
</P>
<P>
But Walltower said he saw Barry in the company of no women other than a city 
employee who went on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, 54, is on trial on 10 charges of cocaine possession, one charge of 
conspiracy with others to get or buy cocaine and three charges of perjury for 
allegedly lying to a grand jury about Lewis' alleged connections to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is 26 years in prison and a 
$1,850,000 fine -- a penalty unlikely to be imposed on any first-time convicted 
drug offender. 
</P>
<P>
In office for 12 years, Barry announced recently he would not seek a fourth 
four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Walltower was the fourth defense witness among an estimated 14 that Barry's 
chief lawyer, Kenneth Mundy, said would be called before concluding the defense 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors ended their case Wednesday after calling 25 witnesses, 10 of whom 
said they saw Barry use cocaine scores of times between 1983 and Jan 18, 1990 
-- the day Barry was arrested by FBI agents in an elaborate hotel sting after 
videotaping him allegedly smoking addictive crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
As he has done every day of the seven-week trial, Barry sat at the defense 
table intently following each witness. 
</P>
<P>
His wife was in the first row of spectators looking on without expression.

NEIGHBORS SAY FARMER WAS NO BROTHER KILLER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For decades, the Ward "boys" tended the dairy herd on their farm at the end of 
a dirt road and, neighbors say, pretty much minded their own business. 
</P>
<P>
"They live off by themselves, but they're not hermits or recluses," said Emilie 
Stilwell. "They're a throwback to the pioneer days. They stick to themselves, 
but if you were raising a barn they'd be the first to arrive and the last to 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
Four brothers, four bachelors. That all changed forever on June 6 when William 
Ward died -- of suffocation, authorities said -- and Delbert Ward was arrested 
and charged with second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny rural communities of Munnsville (pop. 400) and Stockbridge (pop. 140) 
have rallied around Delbert Ward. His neighbors say he could not possibly have 
killed his brother. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 900 people have signed petitions calling on the county prosecutor to 
review the autopsy report on William Ward. When a judge set bail at $10,000 on 
June 25, Delbert Ward's supporters raised the sum outside the courtroom within 
a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Delbert, 59, has been advised by his attorney not to discuss the case. At a 
July 8 banquet that raised almost $1,500 for his defense, he told about 1,000 
of his supporters: "I have a lot of friends all over this county. I thought I'd 
be left in jail, but my friends brought me home." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Wilson of Munnsville, who contributed $500 on the spot to Delbert's 
bail, said: "You have to act on your beliefs when something like this happens. 
I just know there's no way he could have killed his brother." 
</P>
<P>
State police investigators testified at a preliminary hearing that Delbert told 
them the death of 64-year-old Bill was a mercy killing. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say that Delbert told them he smothered Bill in his sleep. 
According to the initial autopsy report, a benign tumor the size of a golfball 
was found in Bill's neck, and he had kidney and prostate tumors that might have 
been cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill had trouble with his head. He accidentally cut his jaw with a chain saw 
(years ago) and got blood poisoning," said Roscoe Ward, 70, the eldest brother. 
"He was doing farm chores up to the day he died, but he wasn't doing too good. 
He'd be burning up, and the next time he'd be shaking all over." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he thought Delbert was innocent, Roscoe Ward replied: "I sure 
do." 
</P>
<P>
The Wards' small farm is on a hill overlooking the undeveloped Stockbridge 
Valley, about 30 miles southeast of Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
A lifetime's collection of odds and ends, old appliances and crumbling farm 
machinery is strewn about the old, unpainted farmhouse where the brothers have 
lived since their childhood. 
</P>
<P>
They have running water and electricity but no telephone and not much else in 
the way of conveniences. 
</P>
<P>
"Their parents lived there and they took care of them until they died, and they 
just stayed," Stilwell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wards, especially Delbert and Bill, whom friends say were inseparable, were 
often seen at The Shack, the Munnsville coffee shop where Stilwell works. They 
made frequent trips to town to shop and buy new parts for their farm machinery. 
None of the four had a driver's license; they would drive their tractor the 5 
miles into town. 
</P>
<P>
At the July 8 banquet, Stilwell sold several pictures of Delbert and Bill 
riding on the tractor for $3 each. 
</P>
<P>
The Wards are described as happy and generous neighbors, self-educated and 
hard-working. Delbert is the youngest. Bill was called the leader. Roscoe never 
stops talking once he starts. Lyman is bashful. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't difficult to get townsfolk in Munnsville to rally around the Wards 
after Delbert's arrest, Grant Kroneck, a local insurance agent, said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in Munnsville since 1947, and I've never seen a community come so 
solidly together on one side of an issue that like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours after Delbert's arrest, Stilwell and Kroneck were circulating a 
petition challenging a medical examiner's report that Bill was killed and 
asking for a second autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we had some friends," said Roscoe Ward. "I just didn't know we had 
friends like that." 
</P>
<P>
Madison County District Attorney Donald Cerio Jr. agreed to a review of the 
autopsy findings. He has said he will not seek a grand jury indictment before 
that review is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular case is quite unique in the intensity of emotions stirred by 
those persons acquainted with the Ward family," said Cerio. He said he doesn't 
believe Delbert is dangerous, but he is confident that he is being justly 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Jars and plastic containers were set out at businesses in town and within days, 
$1,800 was collected, said Stilwell. The money was used to hire two private 
investigators to bolster Delbert's case. The total raised since has climbed to 
almost $3,500.

WEST INDIES: RESIDENTS ENJOY IDYLLIC EXISTENCE SCANT 21 MILES AWAY FROM 
DISINTEGRATION ON SISTER ISLAND OF TRINIDAD.

<P>
A sign on the beach sums up the hazards of Tobago: 
</P>
<P>
Beware of Falling Coconuts. 
</P>
<P>
There is no record of how many casualties have been caused by coconuts on this 
sleepy island of 45,000, where people rarely bother to lock their cars or homes 
and consider themselves a world apart from Trinidad, the bigger of the two 
islands that make up the republic of Trinidad and Tobago. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been there (in Trinidad) for years," said a shopkeeper in the 
village of Plymouth on Tobago's north coast. "Ain't safe, too fast, too noisy." 
</P>
<P>
How Tobagonians managed to evade many of the problems of their sister island, 
only 21 miles away by sea, is almost as mysterious as the inscription on the 
tombstone of Betty Stivens who died near Plymouth in 1783: 
</P>
<P>
"What was remarkable about her, she was a mother without knowing it, and a wife 
without letting her husband know except by her kind indulgences to him." 
</P>
<P>
Tobagonians have given up trying to solve the Stivens riddle. But in Trinidad, 
there are ready explanations as to why Tobago appears to enjoy an idyllic 
existence at a time of severe economic crisis on the bigger island. 
</P>
<P>
"This man Robinson is looking after his own. He is spending millions and 
millions on Tobago," said a businessman in Port of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson comes from the Tobago village of Castara and 
according to many of his critics, he has worked unceasingly since a landslide 
electoral victory in 1986 to ensure prosperity for his home island. 
</P>
<P>
Under Robinson's administration, the runway at the Tobago airport has been 
lengthened to accommodate wide-body aircraft and the harbor at Scarborough, 
Tobago's capital, is being extended to provide berths for cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
The projects are part of the government's efforts to diversify an economy whose 
dependence on oil led to a steep decline in living standards after the collapse 
of oil prices in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of the Robinson government appears to come chiefly from citizens of 
Indian descent, whose forefathers were brought to the islands as indentured 
laborers after the 1838 abolition of slavery created a labor shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Government statistics say Indians account for 40.7% of the population, 
descendants of African slaves for 40.8%. The rest are European, Chinese, and 
mixtures of all description. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who is of African descent, won 1986 elections that broke with 
Trinidadian tradition of voting along racial lines. He ran as candidate of an 
opposition coalition that embraced both Indian and African parties. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance collapsed in 1988, when Robinson fired four Cabinet ministers, all 
Indians, who had criticized him for autocratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is following racist policies," said Basdeo Panday, who lost 
his posts of deputy prime minister and foreign minister in the 1988 sacking. 
"All his actions show that he is a racist." 
</P>
<P>
Panday now heads a new party he says is organized on multiracial lines. 
Government supporters insist that it draws most of its backing from the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians from both major ethnic groups accuse each other of fostering racial 
frictions that they say barely exist at grass-roots level. Still, ordinary 
citizens use racial epithets frequently and freely. 
</P>
<P>
Census figures tend to confirm that on a personal level, race plays a role of 
diminishing importance: the percentage of the population defined as "mixed" has 
risen steadily and now stands at 18%. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no perfect racial harmony here," said the Indian owner of an 
import-export company who is married to a Chinese woman with two children from 
her first marriage to a white Trinidadian. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is nothing like the bloody racial conflict I experienced when I 
lived in Miami and New York." 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper circulation has declined over the last few years because of the 
economic crisis but the republic, which has a literacy rate of 97%, still 
enjoys an unusually varied press. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from two daily newspapers, there is a wide array of popular weeklies 
whose rich fare of anti-government criticism, news and the supernatural could 
put the U.S. supermarket press or European mass circulation papers to shame. 
</P>
<P>
Fierce competition pits The Bomb against Blast, which claims to be the islands' 
circulation leader and has a regular court page -- Blast in Court -- with a 
devoted following. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say the weeklies provide a good pointer to Trinidad and Tobago's 
laid-back attitude toward life and citizens' appetite for wine, women and song. 
</P>
<P>
Court cases in a recent issue of Blast included the theft of coconuts from a 
neighbor's garden and the cocaine trial of Eric Ramjit, who told a judge he had 
taken the drug to soothe fierce toothaches. He was fined $175.

INDIA RECRUITS CITIZENS IN TERRORIST FIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
If anti-terrorist squads have their way, New Delhi's landlords will be more 
inquisitive, citizens more cautious and growling watchdogs ever vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing a rise in bombings linked to two separatist movements, police launched 
a citywide campaign designed to help uncover terrorists and thwart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic idea is to create security awareness," said New Delhi Deputy 
Commissioner of Police Neeraj Kumar. 
</P>
<P>
Although the focus of the effort is terrorism, police are also warning that 
general crime around the nation is expected to rise by 100% during the decade, 
according to government estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The "Crime Prevention" program has an added significance in India's capital, 
where 16 people have been killed and 109 injured this year in bomb blasts 
blamed on Sikh militants. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are also worried another separatist battle waged by Muslim factions 
in the northwestern state of Jammu-Kashmir will spread to the capital. At least 
300 people have died since government troops began a crackdown in the province 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
"New Delhi is a favorite target of the extremists. And any crime-prevention 
program in New Delhi in the present circumstances cannot ignore terrorism," 
said a senior police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Around the city of about 6 million residents, posters urge to keep a lookout 
for terrorists. A leaflet, "How to Terrorize Terrorists," is being distributed 
along with free door chains. 
</P>
<P>
Police are also conducting seminars on safety measures and appealing to people 
to adopt a puppy, which could become a formidable watchdog. Cash awards are 
offered for helpful information about extremists. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, seven bombs have exploded in New Delhi. In addition, several 
high-powered explosive devices were found and defused. One was discovered in 
the crowded New Delhi railway station. 
</P>
<P>
Several suspects have been arrested in connection with the blasts, but no one 
has been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Sikh militants, fighting for a separate homeland in the rich farming state of 
Punjab, have been blamed for many terrorist attacks since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a series of bombs, often concealed in transistor radios, killed at 
least 87 people in the capital. Two years later, Sikh gunmen fired on a 
birthday party south of New Delhi, killing nine people and injuring 14. 
</P>
<P>
Sikhs have been blamed for more than 5,000 deaths around the nation since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has ordered high walls and watch towers 
around his New Delhi residence for fear of attacks by Sikhs, who assassinated 
his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-terrorist campaign is paying special attention to landlords, who 
police say often rent apartments without checking tenants' identification and 
background. 
</P>
<P>
"To instill fear in the terrorist's mind . . . be sure about the credentials of 
your tenant," says one police leaflet. 
</P>
<P>
And potential bombs could be anywhere or anything, authorities warn. 
</P>
<P>
"Always be alert for unattended luggage. While traveling in buses look out for 
passengers behaving in a suspicious manner. If you spot any suspicious-looking 
object do not touch the object. It may be a bomb," according to a police 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
At least one police official said the campaign has been successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Just try leaving your camera at any major intersection. Nobody will pick it up 
and it will lie unclaimed for weeks," said the official, who wished to remain 
anonymous.

AFTER 45 YEARS, A FALLEN SOLDIER FROM THE FIELDS OF FRANCE IS BROUGHT HOME TO 
REST

<TEXT>
<P>
A Georgia soldier killed nearly 45 years ago on the war-torn fields of France 
is finally coming home for burial, and his widow hopes she now can put to rest 
the haunting memories of their life together. 
</P>
<P>
Theo Wilburn Underwood was a 24-year-old Army private fighting in his first 
battle when he was killed Sept. 10, 1944, by a shell that collapsed his 
foxhole. Two weeks later the Army notified his 21-year-old pregnant wife, 
Ernestine, that he was missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
Theo Underwood was declared officially dead July 20, 1945, but his remains 
weren't found until this year, when metal detectors wielded by two French 
youths picked up the soldier's helmet. The youths began digging and found the 
body, the Army told his widow. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone is missing like that, you have a feeling that it could happen. 
And, a lot of times it would run through my mind when I thought about him it 
could happen. But you never really expect it to happen," Ernestine Underwood 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
"When it does happen, it's a whole new ballgame. It didn't depress me. It made 
me sad," she said of the memories that flooded into her mind when the Army 
notified her June 6 that her husband's remains had been found. 
</P>
<P>
The irony of the Army's timing did not escape her. Theo Underwood left New York 
City aboard the Queen Mary on June 6, 1944, bound for the battlefields of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"He never came out of his first and only battle. I felt like that when the boys 
came home in 1945 and 1946, they received recognition. Now, he's coming home 45 
years later and I feel like he deserves recognition," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ernestine Underwood had known all along that her husband was dead. Another 
soldier, Dale White of Bluefield, W.Va., saw Underwood buried by the collapsing 
foxhole and told her. But, without a grave to visit, it was difficult to let 
go. 
</P>
<P>
It also was difficult to convey to her daughters -- one 5 years old when Theo 
Underwood died, the other not yet born -- and later, her grandchildren, that he 
had truly existed. 
</P>
<P>
"The youngest daughter was born after her father was killed, and she always 
wanted a father. So, I think this will give her a father," Ernestine Underwood 
said. "I think it will help our three grandchildren. They can say now, 'I do 
have a grandfather.' Before, all they had was me talking and pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be good for all of us. Because (the remains were) missing, it 
took me 7 to 10 years to put him aside. It was kind of hard to do when you 
don't have something to hold to or look at and say, this is his grave." 
</P>
<P>
A military funeral is planned for Aug. 11 in Savannah, where Ernestine 
Underwood moved after her husband's death. Theo Underwood's cousins, some of 
whom are too young to have known him, have asked to be pallbearers, his widow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's somebody that the older (cousins) remember and the younger ones have 
heard him talked about. He was 6 feet 2, weighed 160 pounds, brown hair, brown 
eyes, olive complexion. He was really good-looking. He was the best-looking guy 
there (in Jeff Davis County). He captured my heart," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Underwood's widow, who married him at age 14 against both families' wishes, 
never remarried. Until recently, she kept a framed 8-by-10 picture of him in 
her bedroom. She had to store it, fearing that sunlight would fade it.

NEW YORK PRISON FINDS INMATES CAN BE A SOFT TOUCH -- FOR ANIMALS

Like wallflowers at a junior-high dance, the Rikers Island inmates hung back. 
Maybe they knew their street-wise facades were about to be punctured by puppy 
love. 
</P>
<P>
For two hours, these teen-agers could almost forget the manslaughter, kidnaping 
or car theft charges that landed them behind bars. Instead, they played with 
seven visiting dogs and cats, a rare touch of tenderness provided monthly by 
volunteers from the Animal Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends think I'm totally nuts, but it's not dangerous as people perceive 
it," said Edith McBean, the center's outreach coordinator, who goes to Rikers 
with Casey, a Jack Russell terrier puppy, and Keen, a Labrador retriever. 
</P>
<P>
"For those two hours, the machismo is dropped; they're just little boys," said 
Diane Smith, coordinator of volunteer visits for the Rikers health services 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
The goals of these visits, which started three years ago, are to decrease 
depression, stress and loneliness and to improve self-images, social skills and 
self-control. The inmates, ages 16 to 19, were chosen because their families 
and friends don't visit. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they're not family, it's something. These people go out of their 
way," said James, a 19-year-old inmate who dreams of becoming a mechanic and 
having a cat. "It makes you feel open, good inside. It gets your mind away from 
the problems you've got. It makes you feel special." 
</P>
<P>
"We're coming in without an agenda -- we're not writing a paper, not there to 
save souls," said Susan Cohen, a therapist on the Animal Medical Center staff. 
"Pets are an icebreaker. Otherwise, what would we say to them: 'Do you come 
here often?' " 
</P>
<P>
The results haven't been analyzed, but at least one effect is evident. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of fights among the adolescents: slashings and stabbings, that 
sort of thing," said Smith. "Once they're put into a relaxed mood, there's less 
of a chance of fighting -- at least, that day." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent night, 10 volunteers arrived in an ebullient conga line, cats 
yawning and dogs yapping as they passed through four security checkpoints. Some 
are employees of the medical center, some are volunteers there and most bring 
their own pets. 
</P>
<P>
Toys, water bowls, dog treats and bags of cookies were piled in the 
otherwise-dismal visitors' room. The five dogs raced around, wagging, sniffing 
and barking. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the 16 inmates huddled in knots of three or four. Under the gaze of 
uniformed officers, the volunteers fanned out, helping the pets introduce 
themselves. The two cats were coaxed from their carriers and gently placed on 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoners, eyes filled with uncertainty, masked their vulnerability with 
bravado. Several bragged that they had once owned the meanest dog on the block. 
Some teased the dogs, holding toys or food out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them to knock it off in a nice way. They stop, maybe after you've said 
it five times," said McBean. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, everyone started to relax. "It's nice to see how they soften up," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The beefiest inmates zeroed in on the brawny dogs, like Teddy, an Appenzeller 
brought by Debra Liccardi, a dog walker, and Nick G. Hayden, vice president of 
a real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
"Teddy's got a tough-looking appearance that a lot of guys at prison love," 
said Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden and Liccardi have been going to Rikers for five months with pets they 
borrow from her clients. She gets the inmates acquainted with the dogs; he 
talks to them about other things. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of sitting there and listening," said Hayden. "They're all 
extremely polite. It's sometimes hard to keep in perspective that they're not 
all saints." 
</P>
<P>
At least until he hears their stories. 
</P>
<P>
"One kid attempted murder a couple of times; another was in for possession of a 
9-millimeter gun, an Uzi and vials of crack. I'm sure if I'd seen him on the 
street, I'd have known he was trouble and walked away," Hayden said. "But I sat 
there, talking to him for an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Some inmates sat quietly, stroking the more tranquil pets, as they spoke with 
the volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to observe them; they have their own little world," said Danny, 19. "I 
wonder what they think about us." 
</P>
<P>
"There are times you do get lonely," confessed Jamar, 18. "I miss my family, 
girlfriend, brothers and sister." 
</P>
<P>
"My brothers are facing hard time; I pray for them every night," said James. 
"After a visit (from the animals), it's hard when you go back to the house." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long, though, before James went back. 
</P>
<P>
An officer bellowed; the inmates filed out. The dogs, panting, sprawled on the 
floor; the cats hid beneath blankets in their carriers. A corrections worker 
searched for the key that would return the visitors to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"You spend a couple of hours and feel like you do something good for them," 
said Hayden. "But you leave very confused, frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he concluded: "If we can get one guy out and keep him out, I think it's 
worth it."

CAMEROON'S TIME-BOMB LAKES TICKING; 
</P>
<P>
DISASTER: NYOS AND MONOUN ARE BEING RECHARGED WITH KILLER CARBON DIOXIDE. 
ANOTHER FATAL BURST IS FEARED.

LAKE NYOS, Cameroon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is new evidence that two Cameroon killer lakes -- Nyos and Monoun -- are 
being recharged with deadly carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1986, Nyos, a jewel-like crater lake, erupted with a burst of deadly 
carbon dioxide gas that killed 1,700 people. Smaller Monoun, 59 miles to the 
south, had already stunned the West African nation two years earlier with an 
outburst that left 37 dead. 
</P>
<P>
Probes of Lake Nyos' bottom waters by a team of U.S. scientists found a 26% 
buildup of carbon dioxide since May, 1987. "It's a stick of TNT waiting to go 
off," said research scientist George W. Kling, who recently finished his 
analysis of Lake Nyos water samples at the Marine Biological Laboratory in 
Woods Hole, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"Our data is still incomplete but we think Monoun is recharging too," said 
Michele L. Tuttle, a U.S. Geological Survey research chemist and a member of 
the scientific team that is studying the lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists have argued that the 1986 release of gas from Lake Nyos was 
caused by a volcanic eruption. 
</P>
<P>
Kling and his colleagues are now convinced that carbon dioxide, formed deep 
inside the Earth, feeds into the lake from one or more underground springs. But 
differences in water temperature and mineral concentrations keep the gas near 
the bottom of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The lake's waters form two layers. The weight of the upper layer acts as a lid 
and holds the gas on the bottom until a violent event such as a landslide, an 
earth tremor, or a volcanic eruption stirs the supercharged bottom waters 
upward. The result is a violent, foaming eruption much like the uncorking of a 
warm bottle of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
A dense, colorless gas, carbon dioxide weighs 1 1/2 times as much as air. A 
concentrated form is used in fire extinguishers because it pushes air aside and 
robs fire of the oxygen needed for burning. 
</P>
<P>
These consequences were evident at Lake Nyos. The eruption of lake gas formed a 
ground-hugging cloud that, as it moved, pushed aside breathable air. A similar 
thing happened at Lake Monoun. In both cases, the victims were robbed of oxygen 
and asphyxiated. 
</P>
<P>
A shallower and smaller lake than Nyos, Monoun doesn't have the capacity to 
release as much gas as its neighbor. But a future eruption could be just as 
deadly as the last, depending on wind direction. 
</P>
<P>
"If another event occurs and the wind is blowing south, it would carry the gas 
right into a small village," said Kling, whose work in Cameroon has been 
supported by the National Geographic Society. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun tragedies are the only recorded events in 
which gas released from lakes has caused the loss of human lives. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the gas, Lake Nyos' waters are a threat. Any future disaster at 
the lake might undermine a natural dam of soft volcanic rock that holds the 
lake within the crater. 
</P>
<P>
"The dam has been steadily eroding since its formation about 400 years ago," 
said John Lockwood, a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian 
Volcano Observatory. "Its collapse would be like letting the Mississippi River 
rampage for a half-hour or so. Floodwaters from Lake Nyos would probably reach 
Nigeria, 65 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood advocates installing a pipe on one side of the lake that would carry 
out water, lowering the level enough to prevent a flash flood if the fragile 
spillway collapses.

YUGOSLAV 'FORBIDDEN ZONE' TO BE OPENED

KOCEVSKA REKA, Yugoslavia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large area in the wooded mountains of northern Yugoslavia was a "forbidden 
zone" for 40 years. With the erosion of communist power, the people finally are 
learning why. 
</P>
<P>
An underground warren was built in the mountains to protect the Communist Party 
elite of the Slovenian republic from any disaster, ranging from nuclear war to 
insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of political prisoners are said to have built the shelter in the 
heart of a heavily guarded 56-square-mile area 40 miles south of Ljubljana, 
capital of Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
On a tour organized by Slovenia's new non-communist government, journalists 
were taken through police roadblocks to a mountain that has been transformed 
into a well-concealed maze of tunnels, galleries and shafts. 
</P>
<P>
Igor Bavcar, the Slovenian interior minister, said the government in Ljubljana 
has been told that similar shelters were built by the other five republics. He 
expressed confidence that, as democracy spreads, "the veil of secrecy will be 
lifted from all of them." 
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-square-yard facility in Slovenia "could accommodate at least 100 
people, and if the need arose, probably several hundred more," said Marko 
Kadunc, an engineer employed there since 1961. He said stocks of fuel, food and 
water were sufficient for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Slovenia and Croatia, the westernmost of Yugoslavia's republics, are ruled by 
center-right parties that defeated reform Communists in the first multiparty 
elections since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
All the other republics except the largest, Serbia, have scheduled multiparty 
elections and free federal elections are expected in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after taking office, Slovenia's new government formed a commission to 
investigate the guarded zone and determine whether political prisoners helped 
build it. 
</P>
<P>
Well-lighted corridors wind through the mountain past dozens of bedrooms, a 
kitchen and conference rooms. There is a small infirmary and a fully equipped 
operating room. 
</P>
<P>
Small, oval steel doors like submarine hatches subdivide the underground area, 
and entry is through a decontamination room. "This place was designed to 
survive a nuclear war," said Kadunc, the engineer. 
</P>
<P>
The complex was finished in the mid-1960s, used for occasional training 
exercises and gradually mothballed after 1978. More than 400 employees 
remained, to maintain the shelter and run a large cattle farm and logging 
operation inside the restricted zone. 
</P>
<P>
An intelligence report published in June by the daily Borba in Belgrade said 
German prisoners of war started the work on the shelter, and Yugoslav prisoners 
took over after the POWs were freed in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Political prisoners and captured officers of various armed groups that fought 
the communists in World War II blasted the tunnels in the mountain, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The zone is just a few miles from Kocevski Rog, a mountain where up to 15,000 
anti-communist fighters who surrendered were executed when the war ended in 
1945.

ELLIS THACKERY; SPECIAL EFFECTS EXPERT FOR MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ellis Thackery, 87, who created special effects for the classic films "King 
Kong" and "The Jazz Singer." 
</P>
<P>
Thackery is credited with developing new uses for a technique to shoot 
background scenes called the "glass shot." The technique involves placing a 
painted glass scene in front of the camera lens and shooting through it. The 
American Society of Cinematographers said Thackery used the technique in the 
1933 RKO Pictures version of "King Kong" and also in Al Jolson's "The Jazz 
Singer." Thackerey's special effects work in the 1941 movie "Women of War" was 
nominated for an Academy Award. On Sunday in Los Angeles of natural causes.

EGIL AARVIK; NOBEL OFFICIAL ENCOURAGED HUMAN RIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Nobel Peace Prize committee chairman Egil Aarvik, who used the Nobel Peace 
Prize to encourage human rights, has died. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
Aarvik died Thursday at Norway's national hospital in Oslo. The cause of death 
was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
A retired journalist and Christian People's Party politician, Aarvik was 
appointed by Parliament to the Norwegian Nobel committee in 1974 and became its 
chairman in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Under his influence, the committee began to use the Peace Prize to encourage 
pro-democracy efforts and human rights. Some awards angered governments. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, China criticized Aarvik when the Nobel committee awarded the 
1989 peace prize to the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled leader. 
</P>
<P>
South African Bishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984 Nobel laureate, told newspapers 
today that the prize to Poland's Lech Walesa in 1983 "and the recognition of 
the church's battle against apartheid were brave decisions that Aarvik has a 
great deal of the credit for." 
</P>
<P>
Aarvik was born on Dec. 12, 1912, in the central Norway town of Borsa. The son 
of a laborer, Aarvik wanted to be an auto mechanic as a youth but went to work 
as a farmhand. 
</P>
<P>
His higher education was limited to a year at college and three months at Bible 
school. 
</P>
<P>
His journalism career began in 1946 with the Christian newspaper Dagsavisa, in 
Trondheim near his hometown. He also published a number of books. 
</P>
<P>
Aarvik was elected to Parliament in 1961 and served until 1977. He was minister 
of social affairs from 1965 to 1971 in a non-socialist coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
Aarvik is survived by his wife, Anna Cathrine, three sons, a daughter and 11 
grandchildren.

HOMELESS FAMILIES FIND GATEWAY OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hattie Long turns toward the chain-link fence that separates her dream from 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
On her side is a temporary shelter, the place where Long, her daughter, Dovie 
Meredith, and her four grandchildren live and hope to mend their broken plans. 
They left St. Louis for California in May to start over. They found only 
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that fence, as Long stands and gazes, dusk settling over a hilltop, are 
the faintly twinkling lights of nearby houses. She knows that, if destiny 
dropped her family here, it can also deliver them across the road, into one of 
those fine homes on the hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
Meredith says what her mother leaves unspoken: "It makes me feel determined. I 
can get over this fence and live on one of these hills." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, they'll live on their strong spirit. That, and the ice cream cones 
Meredith buys her children to assuage their fears. They've never been without a 
home before. And they won't be much longer if an unusual experiment to help the 
homeless works. 
</P>
<P>
They live at Gateway Family Community, a square enclave of 15 small mobile 
homes on what, just a few months ago, was a dusty patch of earth beside the 
Mission San Luis Rey in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say Gateway is the only mobile-home shelter for homeless 
families in California. Even so, with a $200,000 federal grant, $300,000 from 
the city and so few units, Gateway can't help most of Oceanside's estimated 
1,000 homeless. 
</P>
<P>
(In downtown San Diego, a much larger facility for homeless families is run by 
St. Vincent de Paul, which provides 150 bed spaces in a dormitory-like shelter 
for families. The shelter offers medical care, job training, child care, 
educational and recreational programs.) 
</P>
<P>
The Gateway community is determined to prove that families, especially those 
with grit and determination, can turn their lives around in about 30 days. 
That's how long families can stay at Gateway, and, although a month's extension 
might be granted, it's still not much time. 
</P>
<P>
The families chosen to live here possess some undefinable spark that convinces 
Gateway's staff they've got the drive to make it back into the community. Back 
to normal lives of mowing the lawn, hanging out the sheets to dry, and tacking 
pictures on their own walls. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the fire in some of their eyes," said Ron Mazone, a Houston-born, '60s 
generation optimist who was a VISTA volunteer before becoming Gateway's 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Gateway, he said, with its individual units for families and specialized 
counseling, "is new and different." The mobile homes have two bedrooms, a 
living room and kitchen, and are furnished with donated goods. 
</P>
<P>
Mazone's staff looks for families with the drive to succeed. Applicants are 
also screened by the Oceanside Police Department to make sure there's no 
history of felony convictions, drug or alcohol problems, child or spousal 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The first families, some virtually without possessions, gratefully moved into 
the mobile homes in May. A few have already found their way back into permanent 
housing. The others hope that day is near for them. 
</P>
<P>
Mazone believes in his families and defends them from a stereotype that 
homeless are mostly winos and derelicts who have committed homelessness on 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at some of these families," he said. "You think they're 'Leave It to 
Beaver' families." 
</P>
<P>
Despite austere surroundings, the simple grassy play area and some recently 
planted trees, Gateway is like any other tiny neighborhood where the people are 
quite ordinary, except for one thing. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, the bottom fell out of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Stout used to be a pastor in Arizona. Now, the strapping man with sandy 
hair, his wife of five years, Dennie, and their two daughters live in a little 
mobile home, where they talk without bitterness about the misfortune that 
brought them here. 
</P>
<P>
"I never blamed God for it, or myself," Stout said, choosing to regard the 
experience as a divine message. "God has shown me that security doesn't lie in 
our circumstances. It's with family." 
</P>
<P>
The problems started about four years ago, after the Stouts returned to North 
County from their stint in Arizona. Stout said he liked serving the Lord, and 
he expects to again some day. But the family needed money to raise the 
children, and he knew he'd make a fatter paycheck plying another of his skills, 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
But, in 1986, soon after arriving in California, he ruptured disks in his 
spine, ending his days of strenuous physical work. Surgery to remove the 
damaged disks cost $22,000, and even though 80% was paid by insurance, it left 
the family broke. 
</P>
<P>
The Stouts lived on welfare, with benefits totaling $500 a month. Their 
apartment alone cost $575 a month, and, after seven months, the kindly landlord 
who had carried the family asked the Stouts to leave. 
</P>
<P>
They lived in another apartment four months, but lost that one, too. Then they 
house-sat for a friend, and, finally, lived temporarily in a motel room. 
</P>
<P>
Then, nothing was left except Gateway, where, Stout said, "We're resolved to 
the fact that, until finances come in or something dramatic happens, this is 
where we'll have to be for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Daughters Sarah, 4, and Amanda, 20 months, seem oblivious to their parents' 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah has climbed onto the family car, where she's perched on all fours and is 
happily pounding away on the hood like a baby Gene Krupa. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, while Mom and Dad talk, Amanda is getting crabby. She's somehow mashed 
her face sideways into the carpet, hoisting her tiny bottom into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Although Stout said he and his wife, both 36, look at this poverty as "a 
growing process," there are moments when it's hard to be circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
"I've caught myself being embarrassed even with friends, telling them where I 
live. That makes me feel isolated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennie adds, a bit less forgivingly: "That's their problem." 
</P>
<P>
She finds no great privations at Gateway and described it as being "like any 
other neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Friendships are made as the children play together and parents meld into small 
social groups to share confidences, sorrows and hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Gateway lends a quiet but conspicuous helping hand to the families, making sure 
they look right and feel right so they'll be presentable as they seek jobs and 
permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
Dennie said a woman routinely visits to cut hair, and a doctor comes around in 
a van to drive anybody needing medical attention to a clinic in Vista. 
Gateway's seven-person staff provides job counseling, helps families apply for 
welfare, teaches about good nutrition, health and how to draw up a household 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, an adequate budget is still a fantasy to the Stouts. 
</P>
<P>
Dan works full time as a security guard at a large industrial plant in San 
Marcos, earning about $7 an hour. He enjoys the job, but is looking for 
something that will pay a higher wage to support his family of four. 
</P>
<P>
When that happens, the Stouts will get an apartment and continue where they 
left off. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to be a typical, happy nuclear family with a house and a stable 
job," he said. "It'll happen, I know it will." 
</P>
<P>
Two units away, Long and Meredith sit on the front steps, quietly watching the 
night descend, inventing plans to put some luster back on that California dream 
they had when they left St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it is a typical story. Meredith's marriage collapsed, so she packed 
up her mother, the four children, ages 7 to 14, and arrived by train in San 
Diego to start over. 
</P>
<P>
She had done uniformed security work, but there was little demand here for a 
guard who didn't own a car and couldn't find public transportation to work 
odd-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
The family came in May and entered Gateway in June. Meredith found a low-paying 
job to try to tide them over, but her mother, a widow in her '70s, became ill 
with a lung ailment. 
</P>
<P>
"She was on a job, but I got sick and she took care of me, and they fired her," 
said Long, who lived in California once before, back in World War II, when she 
helped build ships at Mare Island in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, Meredith, 30, ventures out to find work or a place to live, but often 
returns to Gateway a little discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go for a job, I say I stay at a temporary shelter. They look at 
homeless as bums. They don't see people who are really struggling to get 
somewhere," Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
Long knows her family has troubles, but her mirth and faith bring them a 
stability no money can buy. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we're not what you call downright suffering. It's just that we've got to 
have money to get into a house," she said. Her eyes scan the family's borrowed 
mobile home, and she added, "It's as good as being in a rich home, but I 
haven't got a maid. Living is living." 
</P>
<P>
That's hard to understand for Meredith's children, who watch television, read 
and wonder what's going to become of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably just a little confused," said 12-year-old Gregory. Some of 
Meredith's kids want to go back to St. Louis, others want to stick it out in 
California, waiting for a break. 
</P>
<P>
Long has opportunity of all kinds in mind and, as a visitor leaves, she 
buoyantly calls, "If you see a nice old man with a lot of money, send him over 
to me at the shelter." 
</P>
<P>
Bob and his wife, who live near the back of the enclave, count the days until 
they can rent an apartment and leave an experience Bob admits had defeated him 
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's streak of bad luck started in May when Bob took a job transfer 
that brought them and their child from Nevada to California. After nine years 
as a semi-trailer mechanic with the same company, his job went sour and a thief 
took almost all of their belongings from their truck. 
</P>
<P>
They found themselves living in a motel room for $49 a night. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared the hell out of me. I was starting to think crazy, I was so scared," 
said Bob, who didn't want to be identified by his last name because he's 
already lost work when employers hear he lives at a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
His wife is afraid she will lose her new clerical job in Del Mar if her boss 
finds out where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
They entered Gateway at the end of May and are nearing the end of their allowed 
two-month stay. Between the clerical work and Bob's landscaping jobs, the 
couple expects to move soon. 
</P>
<P>
Bob said Gateway's staff encouraged him, helping restore his lost self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has learned how frail and precarious the human condition is, and how 
judgmental people can be. 
</P>
<P>
"Society is designed where anybody can be homeless, you're only one paycheck 
away," he said.

<P>
TRANSIT: THE SAN DIEGO TROLLEY'S CRIME RATE IS NEARLY NIL, BUT RECENT INCIDENTS 
HAVE SOME PEOPLE WORRIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Around dusk on July 4, the man boarded the trolley and sat down. He carried 
with him a large satchel, which he later told police contained the makings of a 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
At the corner of 12th and Imperial avenues, the trolley exploded with gunfire. 
The "celebration" came from a 12-gauge shotgun, which, in discharging 
accidentally, ripped a hole through the satchel and penetrated the wall of the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
The man was arrested at the 47th Street Station in Southeast San Diego. No one 
was injured, but the firing of the gun raised a serious concern: 
</P>
<P>
How safe is the San Diego Trolley? 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, the answer is clear. The number of reported crimes occurring on 
or near the trolley is extremely low. Langley Powell, president and general 
manager of San Diego Trolley Inc., said the service suffers .25 incidents of 
crime per 100,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
But Powell said figures don't tell the full story. On any mass transit system, 
feelings and perceptions are almost as critical as statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Trolley officials are concerned about what appears to be a growing apprehension 
among riders about the safety of the trolley, in part because it passes through 
some of the highest-crime neighborhoods of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are somewhat apprehensive, and that concerns us," Powell said. 
"But we've provided a level of security that we hope eases that to a certain 
degree." 
</P>
<P>
Powell said that, since its inception July 26, 1981, the trolley has hired 
Heritage Security Services of Loma Portal to police its 16-mile South Line. 
(The 18 1/2-mile East Line was added in 1989.) Fifteen guards were hired in 
1981, and just recently -- after the shotgun incident -- the 39th was added. 
They work at random locations throughout the network -- on foot, in patrol 
cars, on the trolley itself, in parking lots and depots -- from 4:45 a.m., when 
the trains roll out, to 1:45 a.m., when they stop. 
</P>
<P>
The operators of the trolley face a much different situation than that in Los 
Angeles, where 108 county sheriff's deputies were recently hired to work the 
new light-rail Blue Line, which follows a 19-mile route from Long Beach to Pico 
Boulevard in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. George Saldamando, who heads the street gang unit for the San Diego Police 
Department, said that any amount of gang activity along San Diego's East or 
South line is nothing compared to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles and San Diego are completely different when it comes to gangs," 
Saldamando said. "In L.A., it's not uncommon to have a dozen gang-related 
homicides in a weekend. There it's a tremendous problem, almost uncontrollable. 
So crime along the Blue Line was a huge concern." 
</P>
<P>
Despite three recent gang-related shootings near trolley stations in Southeast 
San Diego, Saldamando said, the service is safe and, at the moment, not at risk 
because of gang activity in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Tereschuck, vice president in charge of security for San Diego Trolley, 
said that, although no one from a law enforcement agency has been hired to work 
for the service, law enforcement officers do assist as advisers and were 
instrumental in picking Heritage Security Services. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that, when the trolley opened, "security was not the concern it 
now represents." The growth of the system -- and the growth of the city and 
county -- have made it a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth has been phenomenal," Tereschuck said. "We've gone from a 15.9-mile 
system to a 35-mile system. We've gone from seven or eight park-and-ride 
centers to twice that many. We first parked 1,000 cars a day (in trolley 
station parking lots). Now we park twice that many. Our passenger load has 
increased from 12,000 a day to more than 50,000 on a typical weekday." 
</P>
<P>
Almost a decade after cars began rolling from the Santa Fe depot to San Ysidro, 
the East Line opened in June of last year. Just recently, the Bayside Line 
opened, connecting Seaport Village, the Gaslamp Quarter and the San Diego 
Convention Center to C Street. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the low crime figures, do people feel safe on the trolley? 
</P>
<P>
Tereschuck said the "question of perception is difficult to answer." He said 
much of the mail he gets is from people who marvel at the system's security, 
while others complain heatedly about having had their cars stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"Perception is most affected by what's happened to you," Tereschuck said. 
</P>
<P>
Trolley station parking lots report about a dozen stolen cars a month. But 
Tereschuck noted that "one out of every 42 people in the county can expect to 
have their car stolen during the time they live here. Compared to that, I'd say 
our stats are great. But, even so, I want perception to be consistent with the 
record. That's what we're striving for." 
</P>
<P>
Although San Diego is no match for Los Angeles in gangs, Tereschuck said they 
are a concern. 
</P>
<P>
On a wall near the trolley station at 54th Street and Imperial Avenue, large 
red graffiti visible from passing cars reads "Crips!" 
</P>
<P>
Powell noted one recent incident in which a trolley car was almost strafed by 
gunfire during a shoot-out between rival gang members near the 47th Street 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of graffiti, slashed seats and broken windows -- the bane of mass 
transit -- Powell said the trolley's policy is to remove or fix such problems 
immediately. If a cut seat or broken window can't be replaced at once, or 
graffiti removed before it spreads like a virus, the car is put out of service 
immediately. He calls the ploy "deliberately psychological" and says it works. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Leitner, spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transit Development Board, the 
agency that oversees the trolley, said there are more complaints about security 
during non-daylight-saving time months, when it gets darker earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said particular stops are more trouble than others. He named 12th Avenue 
and C Street near City College as among the worst; 47th Street is another. 
</P>
<P>
Near City College, women students have reported being harassed by vagrants, 
both at the station and on the cars. Police say that drug dealing, especially 
of crack, is a problem at 12th and C. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy has cast a shadow on the 47th Street station since the East Line 
started in '89. Powell said the district is considering a redesign of the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"The tracks are up high in comparison to the street," he said. "You have to 
climb this dark flight of stairs, and it makes people nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Powell said the trolley's most persistent crimes are graffiti, cut seats, 
broken windows and stolen automobiles. Tereschuck calls the incident of "a man 
on board with a gun" the most serious the trolley has faced. 
</P>
<P>
Tereschuck said that crimes committed in neighborhoods near the trolley are 
sometimes wrongly perceived as occurring on the trolley. He said a recent 
stabbing victim trudged from 25th and Imperial -- where the crime occurred -- 
to the tracks at 25th and Commercial, where his body was discovered by police. 
</P>
<P>
"The crime had nothing to do with the trolley, but it was perceived that way," 
Tereschuck said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the daughters of James Oliver Huberty, the gunman who killed 21 people 
in a San Ysidro McDonald's restaurant in 1984, was once quoted as saying that 
her father enjoyed "playing chicken" with the trolley with her on the back of 
his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said games of chicken are not uncommon. He said a sailor died near the L 
Street Station in Chula Vista in 1984 in what officials have since labeled a 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many riders interviewed by The Times expressed concern about 
security on the trolley. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:03 on a recent weeknight, Michael Byers boarded in La Mesa. Byers, a 
20-year-old salesman, takes the East Line several times a week from his home 
near Euclid Avenue to Grossmont Center, where he works. 
</P>
<P>
Byers said he's never experienced "real danger" on the trolley, "but a lot of 
weird things happen all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Byers was sitting across from a man who had a sweater draped over 
three walnut shells. When he and the stranger made eye contact, Byers said, the 
man swung the sweater over his shoulder, like a magician pulling back a cape to 
reveal a dove. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess which one the dollar bill is under," the man demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Byers guessed -- wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess again," the man said. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong again. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," the man said, "let's play double or nothing for $25. Let's see your $25 
first." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Byers got up and moved to another seat. 
</P>
<P>
Byers and a companion, Amos Johnson, 26, said fights often break out on board. 
</P>
<P>
"One night, there was this really vicious one between three security officers 
and two other guys," Byers said. "I knew the guys had to be on something, 
because the way they went after these security guards was just insane. Here are 
these guards with guns and nightsticks and these idiots -- who have nothing but 
their hands to work with -- are going after these guys with everything they've 
got." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who get on are in their own little world," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Many riders complained that "drunks and crazies" are, by far, the most annoying 
nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
On the South Line on a recent afternoon, a well-dressed man sat in a corner, 
looking out the window, talking only to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Another man tried, in vain, to engage anyone he could in conversation -- but 
only about horror movies, the bloodier and scarier the better. He announced, in 
a voice that seemed to rattle the windows, that Freddy Krueger should be the 
next President. 
</P>
<P>
A third man entered, tattooed from head to bare feet. Everyone tried to avoid 
looking at his face. 
</P>
<P>
Mike and Judy Noe may have summed up best what riding the trolley is like, 
almost 10 years down the line. The Noes, an East County couple, took the East 
Line the other night from the El Cajon Station to the Civic Center depot to see 
a play at Horton Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The Noes looked out of place at near the midnight hour. They were quiet, 
well-dressed and circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
They said they ride the trolley whenever they venture downtown for a play or 
dinner, which is often. 
</P>
<P>
And they've never experienced a problem. They consider the trolley impeccably 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sometimes an education to listen to the language around here," Judy Noe 
said, "but we've never been confronted by anything unpleasant. We love it. As 
to whether we always will -- who can say? No one call tell about the future." 
</P>

LOW-COST HOUSING: PRECIOUS COMMODITY; 
</P>
<P>
CITY MUST NOT ALLOW DECREASE IN THE LIMITED SUPPLY OF UNITS FOR THE POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the city of San Diego, where 80,000 families need help paying the rent but 
just 18,000 have received some form of assistance during the past 10 years, 
low-income housing should be viewed much like water -- as a precious, 
endangered commodity. 
</P>
<P>
The city's pricey rents compound the urgency of an emerging nationwide housing 
crisis that could begin this fall. In September, a congressionally imposed 
moratorium is scheduled to expire, allowing developers of federally subsidized 
housing projects to pre-pay their mortgages. Once that's done, they will be 
able to raise rents to market rates, in many cases to levels that the current 
low-income tenants cannot afford. The very real possibility of eviction looms 
for some. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, the owner of a 200-unit complex has advised the San Diego Housing 
Commission that she intends to pre-pay her federal loan. Another, the principal 
owner of 800 more apartments in two complexes in Rancho Penasquitos and 
Clairemont, intended to do the same thing, until the Housing Commission came up 
with this novel proposal: it would form a nonprofit corporation and buy the 
projects from him for $38.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
That sounds like a huge sum -- Mayor Maureen O'Connor and Councilman Bruce 
Henderson already have balked at the idea -- until one examines the 
alternatives. Then it becomes abundantly clear that the idea is a sound one. 
The City Council should embrace it. 
</P>
<P>
Housing officials estimate that rents in the two complexes could rise from a 
current average of $315 monthly to as much as $750 when restrictions are taken 
off. About 85% of the tenants would be unable to afford those increases. 
</P>
<P>
Government must help. But how? Congress is considering legislation to stave off 
the impending crisis, but it and the Housing Commission want to ensure that 
tenants never face this situation again. The commission could subsidize market 
rents, but purchase of the units would guarantee that they are reserved for the 
poor forever. 
</P>
<P>
At about $47,000 per apartment, purchase is an expensive proposition. But, 
largely because of land prices, it costs more than $100,000 per unit to build 
housing for the poor in middle-class neighborhoods like North City West. 
Acquisition of existing housing costs between $75,000 and $95,000 a unit. The 
city is committed by policy to building affordable housing outside the poor 
neighborhoods where it has traditionally been placed. 
</P>
<P>
Another argument in favor of purchasing is that, when the useful life of the 
apartments ends, the commission also will own a valuable asset -- the 
increasingly expensive land on which the units stand. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the purchase would come from a combination of bonds and the sale 
of tax credits. Money for rehabilitation would be borrowed from the state at 3% 
over 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
If the whole idea seems daunting, try thinking about low-income housing the way 
the drought is teaching us to think about water: If we don't conserve today, 
there won't be enough to go around tomorrow.

Now, let me get this straight: La Jolla Gallery manager Joy Ortner is upset 
because "people think they can spend $3 on a hamburger and be provided a place 
to sit with a view like someone dining in a restaurant in a dignified way." 
("Fast-Food Outlet's Benches Stir McStrife in La Jolla," July 15) Well, excuse 
me! 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder that La Jolla Village businesses are not prospering: Traffic 
there is a nightmare, parking is next to impossible and many stores and 
galleries employ people who share Ms. 0rtner's elitist attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it: The McDonald's benches really are not contributing to declining 
sales in the surrounding businesses; they're just benches, for Pete's sake. 
Maybe, if Ms. Ortner and her disgruntled neighbors were more willing to be 
courteous, pleasant and non-judgmental to the variety of people who visit La 
Jolla's Village, their businesses would actually improve. How about it, Joy? It 
just might work. Lord knows, it couldn't hurt.

THE SOUL-SEARCHING ROAD TO ONE'S ROOTS; 
</P>
<P>
ADOPTION: THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE PENDING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD OPEN 
ADOPTION RECORDS TO BIOLOGICAL AND ADOPTIVE PARENTS AND ADOPTEES.

<P>
After almost three decades of a love that has weathered temper tantrums, 
unfinished homework, preteen confusion, adolescent anguish, and addictions 
ranging from cookies to amphetamines, I could not say "No, Judi, do not search 
for your birth mother." 
</P>
<P>
Our daughter was 28 years old. Her decision to search for her roots was 
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
That was 12 years ago. It has been a long time since I have thought about our 
daughter's trip to North Carolina to find her "first" mother. When I read that 
the state Assembly had passed a bill that "would end confidentiality in 
adoptions," the memory became current once again. 
</P>
<P>
The pending legislation would allow records of adoptees between 1938 and 1984 
to be open to adoptive parents, biological parents and, of course, themselves. 
Although I agreed with Judi's decision to search, I am ambivalent about this 
new, potential erosion of confidentiality in adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
As the mother of two adopted children, I have enjoyed an anonymity that 
protected my husband and me from intrusion and my children from possibly 
unpleasant surprises. On the other hand, I remember the many troubling 
questions our children asked over the years that I was unable to answer. 
</P>
<P>
As a toddler, our daughter tolerated a consistently asked question from 
strangers on the street and even visitors in our home: "Where did you get your 
blond hair?" She would look at me and my black bob and shrug her small 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
As she grew, Judi had questions of her own? "Were my 'first' parents Jewish?" 
"Why do I have such high cheekbones?" "Do you think that my other mother had 
any other children?" My answers had to be generalizations and platitudes. I had 
so little information. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '50s, agencies gave adoptive parents only the most basic facts. We 
learned that our baby was physically and mentally healthy, that her mother was 
small and her dad was tall, that she cried and laughed a lot. She was named 
Barbara at birth. 
</P>
<P>
When Judi was 28, she asked a challenging question, one she had never posed 
before. "Tell me, Mom, did 'she' have cancer, kidney disease, problems with her 
period, diabetes, etc.?" Our daughter had awakened to the fact that the answers 
she was giving on her doctors' questionnaires concerned her adopted parents and 
grandparents, but their genes and disabilities were not relevant. Judi was 
having medical problems and she needed family history. 
</P>
<P>
She hesitated to tell us that she wanted to find her biological mother, lest 
she hurt our feelings. But our parenthood was not threatened. We supported and 
encouraged her. 
</P>
<P>
Judi contacted a social worker in North Carolina, at the agency that had placed 
her in a foster home, temporarily, and then in our home. At the worker's 
invitation, she traveled there. 
</P>
<P>
The social worker shared her birth mother's first name and the general location 
where she had lived. That's all. Feeling cheated, Judi continued her journey 
through the mountains, speaking to farmers and their wives, sharing coffee and 
chatter with anyone who would take the time. 
</P>
<P>
She returned to the city of her birth and, using the name supplied by the 
social worker, her own birth name, her birthdate and the hospital, found her 
mother's full name in the city clerk's records. 
</P>
<P>
But, suddenly afraid of confronting her birth mother, our daughter did not 
proceed further. She simply flew home. 
</P>
<P>
Judi's social worker had opened the file as far as she was permitted by law. 
When we adopted our children, we were told that when they were 18 years old 
they could see their records. But by the time our daughter tried to exercise 
that privilege, the law had changed. 
</P>
<P>
Not every adoptee shares Judi's desire to find her biological parents. We know, 
because 18 months before we adopted Judi, we adopted Jeff, who can't understand 
his sister's search for the past. When Judi suggested that Jeff obtain similar 
information, his impatient response was, "Who needs it?" 
</P>
<P>
When Jeff, now 41, was a teen-ager, we visited the community in which we 
adopted our children. He refused to walk down the street or stay in a local 
motel. Years later, he confided that, at the time, he had been afraid that his 
birth mother would recognize him and "steal" him back. 
</P>
<P>
Every child is different. I shudder when I try to imagine what it would have 
been like if confidentiality and anonymity had not protected our son. What if 
his birth mother had known where to find him? 
</P>
<P>
There are two sides to this legislation. There is a wealth of information that 
can help adoptive parents understand the infants who become their very own. 
There is a real and deep-seated need among some adoptees to find their "roots" 
and satisfy themselves that they were not heedlessly abandoned. And there are 
many parents who relinquish babies in the children's best interest, who might 
suffer less if they could learn, at the very least, that the children are 
thriving. 
</P>
<P>
But safeguards must be included in any legislation. If I were a new adoptive 
parent today, I would need to know that no one could arrive at my doorstep to 
confuse my child, demand him or her back, or harass us. I would also hope that 
biological parents could be protected from confrontation and embarrassment. 
Finally, I would wish that adopted children would be able to seek and receive 
the family medical histories of their birth parents. 
</P>
<P>
Each member of the adoption "triad" has special needs. Not one of those needs 
should be met at the expense of any one of the members. 
</P>
<P>
Judi would still like to know if her mother was a towhead. But the possibility 
of opening wounds for her biological mother, who now must be close to 80 years 
old, have kept her from completing her search to this day.

BORDER SEWAGE PLANT, FINALLY AT HAND, MUST PROCEED APACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than half a century after Mexican sewage began to seep across the border, 
the first real chance for long-term relief from what has become a torrent of 
effluent is finally at hand. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Mexico have signed a historic pact calling for 
construction of a $200-million border sewage treatment plant. The facility will 
process the 10 million to 12 million gallons of raw sewage that each day pours 
into the United States via the Tijuana River, cascading down canyons from 
Tijuana's poorer neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The sewage has resulted in the quarantine of a 2 1/2-mile stretch of beach just 
north of the border since the early 1980s. It also fouls a sensitive wetland 
bird sanctuary and border-area horse farms. It has prompted decades of angry 
rhetoric and frustration, symbolized by then-Imperial Beach Mayor Brian 
Bilbray's 1980 bulldozer ride against the rising tide of sewage. 
</P>
<P>
Now just two major obstacles stand in the way of the plant's opening in 1994 or 
1995: funding and the outfall pipe's potential harm to the environment. We hope 
that neither will block this most crucial of public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact review is under way to determine whether the huge pipe 
that will dump treated sewage at sea will cause harm. The conduit will enter 
the surf at a site not far from two federally protected ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the pipe and the plant do not damage the environment, Congress, 
the state and the city must pay for most of the various components of the 
treatment plant and the pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
To date, only about $32 million of that money is earmarked. The Mexican share 
is expected to be about $41 million, money that will be put up front by a U.S. 
loan program. 
</P>
<P>
The funding must be swiftly and consistently approved, and construction should 
proceed apace. Our two governments are too close to solving one of our region's 
most enduring problems to allow any delay.

GROWTH AN ISSUE IN SEWER PACT REVISIONS; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: LOS ANGELES MUST UPDATE ITS CONTRACTS WITH ADJACENT CLIENT 
COMMUNITIES. FEDERAL CLEAN-WATER RULES MUST BE OBSERVED; RATES WILL RISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than two dozen cities and agencies, including El Segundo and sewer 
districts serving small portions of San Pedro and Terminal Island, are 
preparing to negotiate new sewer contracts with the city of Los Angeles that 
officials predict will mean higher rates for residential, commercial and 
industrial users in most of those areas. 
</P>
<P>
The new contracts, moreover, may give the Los Angeles City Council the power to 
monitor -- and perhaps stymie -- planned development in some of its neighbor 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The coming negotiations represent the most ambitious effort yet to standardize 
and make more equitable Los Angeles' agreements with so-called contract cities 
and agencies, some of which have been dumping waste into its sewer system under 
contracts that date to the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
The talks will also give Los Angeles a chance to bring the contracts in line 
with federal clean-water regulations that have been hanging over the city's 
head for more than a decade. State officials charged with enforcing those 
regulations have threatened to withhold sewer-related grants from the city -- 
estimated at $50 million over the next five years -- if the contracts are not 
updated. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are not expected to begin before September, but potentially 
troublesome issues have already emerged in preliminary talks. Key among them is 
the Los Angeles City Council's intention to use the new sewer agreements as a 
growth-control tool with the contract cities and agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The council, at the request of members Marvin Braude and Ruth Galanter, voted 
this month to require all cities and agencies with new sewer contracts to 
furnish Los Angeles with regular reports about zoning changes and building 
permits. The council also voted to give itself, rather than city staff, control 
over contract cities' and agencies' requests for additional capacity in the 
sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Refusing such a request could thwart development in a community covered by a 
Los Angeles sewer contract. 
</P>
<P>
"The interest of the city is in controlling the regional decisions that are 
made," Braude said at a recent council committee meeting. "Those are going to 
be the key decisions in the next decade. . . . If the city had utilized its 
power more aggressively (in the past), we could have limited the growth in the 
Malibu area and prevented congestion on Pacific Coast Highway, we could have 
controlled what goes on in the Marina del Rey area in a much more effective 
way, and perhaps other areas, as well." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is already locked into legal disputes with several contract cities 
that have refused to comply with similar reporting requirements for zoning 
changes and building permits, clauses in a temporary sewer-limitation ordinance 
the council passed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from those cities -- El Segundo, Culver City, Burbank, Glendale -- 
and others have accused Los Angeles of trying to exert too much influence over 
their cities' affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our perception is that Los Angeles is using the (federal clean-water 
regulations) to change a lot of other things in the contracts," said Ora 
Lampman, director of public works in Burbank. "The Los Angeles City Council is 
apparently looking for some type of land-use controls of areas outside its city 
boundaries. Our position is that Los Angeles doesn't have any authority to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said grumbling from the contract cities and agencies is to be 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't criticize them for that," she said at a recent council committee 
meeting. "It is their job to maintain as much autonomy and control as they can, 
but it is our sewer system, and they are buying into it." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials predict that the new agreements, to take effect next 
summer, will earn the city an additional $80 million over 10 years, mostly from 
higher sewer fees. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials have been unable to say how much the new contracts will 
cost each client community, but bills are expected to go up across the board 
because the city intends to pass along costs associated with the $3.4-billion 
renovation of the Hyperion sewage treatment plant at El Segundo. The expansion 
and upgrading project at Hyperion, begun in 1987, is due to be completed in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
For years, sewer users within Los Angeles and some contract areas have been 
subsidizing those in other contract areas because many agreements do not 
adequately cover the cost of services, officials said. One of the goals of the 
contract talks, they said, is to treat all users alike. 
</P>
<P>
"The contracts are so old they are just not reflective of the system that the 
city now operates," said Jim Gratteau, head of financial management for the 
county Sanitation Districts. Gratteau's agency has several sewage agreements 
with the city, including one covering unincorporated county territory in San 
Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Los Angeles and its contract cities and agencies have been 
meeting for more than two years to prepare for the formal contract talks, which 
both sides acknowledge are likely to be rocky at times. Several officials have 
said privately that they expect to end up in court before the negotiations are 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is trying to jockey for position," said one negotiator for a contract 
city. "Each agency is trying to minimize its costs. The city of Los Angeles is 
sitting all alone on the other side of the table." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations at first were to open late last year, but delays in drafting a 
model contract -- to serve as the city's starting point with each of the 29 
contract cities and agencies -- have pushed the opening session into September. 
The delay means that the city will not be able to keep its promise to state 
officials that new contracts would be approved by Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, no one knew how complex this would be," said Fred Hoeptner, a 
senior civil engineer for Los Angeles who is overseeing the talks. "It is 
something you do once in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
State officials, increasingly impatient with the slow progress toward talks, 
announced last week that they will impose a new deadline for meeting the 
federal clean-water regulations after the first round of negotiations is over. 
Frank E. Peters of the State Water Resources Control Board said he may "have no 
alternative but to stop payments" on grants to the city because "cooperation 
seems to be dwindling" between the city and the contract groups. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the federal guidelines, the city must base its charges on both the 
volume of sewage flowing into the system and the strength of the flow. Current 
charges are based on volume only, so cities that dump particularly strong 
effluent requiring extra treatment pay the same rate as cities dumping waste 
that is more easily treated. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed rate structure, for example, Burbank would have to pay 
higher fees than Beverly Hills because Burbank dumps concentrated sludge into 
the Los Angeles system, while Beverly Hills dumps mostly residential effluent, 
which is less costly to treat. This difference is not considered in the rates 
the two cities now pay. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations also require the city to revamp the contracts so that each 
agency pays a fair share of construction, operation and maintenance costs of 
the system, and that users of the three treatment plants within the Hyperion 
system are treated equitably. 
</P>
<P>
Although the contract cities and agencies say they want a more equitable fee 
system, Los Angeles city officials predicted that the transition will not be 
easy.

LIBRARIES READ SIGNS OF CHANGE, GO ETHNIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Perkins, Inglewood's head librarian since 1962, has a rule of thumb about 
the relationship between the faces of library visitors and the books he must 
stock on the shelves: When one changes, so must the other. 
</P>
<P>
When the city's population shifted from white to black years ago, the library's 
collection expanded to include materials on black issues. Today, as a large 
population of immigrants from Mexico, Cuba and Central America moves into the 
city, Perkins is rearranging the shelves again. 
</P>
<P>
The library is hiring a Latino librarian and staff member this year to handle a 
$116,000 expansion of its Spanish-language periodical collection. The new 
Hispanics Services Division was created when librarians began noticing the many 
Spanish-speaking visitors and the popularity of Latino-oriented materials. 
Latinos make up more than a third of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
"A library is always changing," said Adalin Torres-Zayas, who will manage the 
Latino collection. "If it doesn't change, it just becomes an empty building." 
</P>
<P>
The libraries in other South Bay cities also are adapting to ethnic changes. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance Public Library has added to its Chinese, Japanese, Korean and 
Vietnamese collections in recent years, and a study on the library's future 
recommends more emphasis on Asian-language materials. 
</P>
<P>
The Carson Regional Library, which is part of the county library system, has 
expanded its dial-a-story service to include children's stories in English, 
Spanish and Japanese. The library offers orientation tours in English and 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"What libraries are trying to do is base their collection on their population," 
said Jim Buckley, the head librarian in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Among Inglewood's plans are a language lab to teach Latinos English, more 
books, newspapers, magazines, videos and compact disks in Spanish, and new 
bilingual library information brochures and maps. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood library officials are planning to survey families in predominantly 
Latino neighborhoods to determine what the community wants from the library. 
They also hope to lure to the stacks Latinos who may not currently use the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
"If you come from a country in Latin America, the only contact you have with a 
library is in the university," said Torres-Zayas, a Puerto Rico native who is 
the library's head of circulation. "The public library system is very new in 
Latin America. People are not used to going to the library. We have to say, 
'This is what we can do for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood's Spanish collection already includes more than 4,000 book titles, 25 
magazines and newspapers and 400 records, paperback books and pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most popular items are English-as-a-second-language materials, 
comic books for children with such titles as "Pato Donald" ("Donald Duck") and 
"Conan el Barbaro" and romance comic books for adults. 
</P>
<P>
In conversations with visitors, Torres-Zayas said, she has found a need for 
more how-to books on such subjects as helping children with their studies, 
disciplining children and preparing for careers. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Garcia, 27, a native of El Salvador who was checking out a stack of 15 
Spanish-language books on a recent morning, said he fully supports expanding 
the Inglewood collection. Among his books: a history of Rome, an encyclopedia 
of medical terms and a biography of King Juan Carlos I of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Carrio, the bilingual coordinator for the Inglewood Unified School 
District, said the library can be an important resource for newly arrived 
immigrants. He welcomed the proposed expansion and said providing reading 
material in Spanish for Latino youngsters keeps them in touch with their 
culture and helps to preserve their self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
Getting newly arrived Latino immigrants into the library with Spanish-language 
materials will also eventually help them learn English, Carrio said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres-Zayas said the essence of the expansion is to make the Inglewood library 
more welcome to people from other cultures. As part of that effort, about 60% 
of the staff has completed a short course on basic Spanish phrases. 
</P>
<P>
The staff members didn't learn any arcane vocabulary or the conjugations of 
irregular verbs, Torres-Zayas said, but "now they know how to say, 'I don't 
speak Spanish, but I can get someone who does.' " 
</P>
<P>
While Inglewood is beefing up its Spanish-language collection, other libraries 
in the South Bay are concentrating on different populations. 
</P>
<P>
In Torrance, where the 1980 census counted 20% of the population as Asian and 
8% as Latino, there are 400 items in the Spanish collection and between 2,500 
and 3,000 in Asian languages. In recent months, Chinese-language materials have 
been checked out more often than other items in the Torrance foreign-language 
collection, followed by Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Spanish, the Carson library has materials in Hindi, Samoan, Korean, 
Tagalog and several other languages. 
</P>
<P>
"Every culture, every ethnic group, can find information about themselves in 
our library," said Billie Frierson, the community library manager in Carson. 
"If we don't have it, we can find it. We're here as a resource for everyone."

RANKS SWELL AT GOLF CLUB AFTER MEMBERS DECIDE TO BUY IT

<P>
Nearly 500 people -- far more than expected -- have joined the North Ranch 
Country Club in Thousand Oaks since members announced two months ago that they 
are purchasing the club and championship golf course from Prudential Insurance 
Co. of America. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials had hoped to sell 400 memberships by Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not expect this type of response," said members' attorney Tony 
Ciasulli. 
</P>
<P>
He said a competitive club fee and an aggressive marketing campaign contributed 
to the early success of the membership drive. 
</P>
<P>
Memberships for golf course privileges were selling for about $42,500, with an 
additional $4,250 for tennis court privileges. 
</P>
<P>
Ciasulli said officials hope to sell an additional 100 memberships at $60,000 
each. 
</P>
<P>
The members decided to purchase the club for $28 million after the New 
Jersey-based company announced several months ago that it is selling its golf 
courses and country clubs. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ciasulli, the members were fearful that foreign investors might 
purchase the 27-hole golf course, 12 tennis courts and clubhouse on 250 acres 
of rolling hills north of the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The sale will transfer control of the club to members and change the membership 
to an equity or share in ownership of the operation. TINA DAUNT

The Ventura Port District has decided not to renew a Canadian company's option 
to develop a 400-room hotel because the company failed to make a $125,000 
payment by the June 20 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Cavendish Resorts has held an option since 1987 to develop the 20-acre site -- 
the largest remaining piece of undeveloped property within the port of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter received last week by the district, the company cited economic 
concerns and the city's moratorium on new water hookups as reasons for its 
failure to make the payment. 
</P>
<P>
The district is free to consider proposals from other developers, although it 
will not actively seek them, said Richard Hambleton Jr., chairman of the 
district board of commissioners. "The board is hopeful that Cavendish can and 
will present another plan," Hambleton said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has invested more than $2 million in the project, Hambleton said.

ROLLING HILLS IS EXPECTED TO BAN MOUNTAIN BIKES FROM HORSE TRAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Rolling Hills is preparing to pull in the reins on mountain bicyclists who are 
attracted to the city's 24 miles of equestrian trails. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members, who say that horses are being frightened by bicyclists 
and that serious accidents could occur, are expected to pass an ordinance 
Monday outlawing bicycles and other wheeled vehicles on the trails. Motorcycles 
and all-terrain vehicles are already banned there. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've ever ridden a horse, you know they can be pretty unpredictable and 
easily startled," said Councilwoman Jody Murdock. "The trails were created for 
walking and riding and not wheeled vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that the trails are up and down and have a lot of blind spots," 
said William Martin, president of Caballeros del Rancho Palos Verdes, the 
equestrian club that proposed the ordinance. "Mountain bikers come flying down 
these things and spook the horses." 
</P>
<P>
The rugged horse trails in Rolling Hills and elsewhere on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula are a natural lure for mountain bike enthusiasts. For example, the 
Portuguese Bend area of Rancho Palos Verdes, next to Rolling Hills, is popular 
among riders, said Troy Braswell, who owns a Redondo Beach bike store and heads 
the BC Riders, a mountain bike club. 
</P>
<P>
Braswell said that he does not ride the trails in Rolling Hills and that his 
club tries to discourage bicyclists from using the trails. He said the club's 
code of ethics calls for bicyclists to respect equestrians everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, (the code) is to yield and be courteous," Braswell said. 
</P>
<P>
In Rolling Hills, city officials said the problem with mountain bikes is not of 
crisis proportions because the entrance to the community is gated and access to 
the trails around its perimeter is limited. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they cited a noticeable increase in the number of bicyclists 
using the trails as the sport grows in popularity. "They'll come in, 20, 30, 40 
of them on the weekend, and ride the trails," said Councilwoman Ginny 
Leeuwenburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Although no injuries have been reported, officials said there have been some 
close encounters between horses, their riders and bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance calls for signs to warn mountain bicyclists that they 
are unwelcome. Scofflaws could be ticketed by sheriff's deputies, who routinely 
patrol the trails on all-terrain vehicles, officials said. Offenders face a 
$500 fine or six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Braswell said he wants the trails to remain open to bikers but understands the 
concerns of Rolling Hills residents. "I wish it was otherwise," he said, "but 
they are a very horse-oriented community, and there is some sensitivity."

CITY'S CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM MAY SOON REACH 80,000 HOUSEHOLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 80,000 households in San Diego could be offered curbside recycling 
service by early next year under a plan to extend the use of city landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The city now picks up materials for recycling at the curbsides of about 13,000 
households under a pilot program established in 1988 in University City. 
Another 27,000 residences will get the service this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's expansion proposal would increase the number to 80,000 households 
throughout the city, or a little more than 25% of all San Diego residences. 
</P>
<P>
Trash collection and curbside recycling services are free, but if voters 
approve a possible November ballot measure, customers would be charged a 
monthly fee of $8.50 per household for both services. 
</P>
<P>
The citywide fees would generate about $250,000 a year, or about one-fourth of 
the estimated $1 million it will cost the city to expand its recycling 
services, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The city would raise additional funds by selling the materials for recycling. 
Residents would not be paid for materials left on their curbs for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is the only city in the county that does not charge a fee for trash 
collection and disposal. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's Public Services and Safety Committee on Wednesday sent the 
recycling expansion proposal to full council, recommending its passage. The 
council is expected to approve the measure later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for pickups to be phased in from September through April, 
1991. Recycling drop-off points would be established at all city recreation 
facilities. City crews now pick up the materials, but a private contractor, 
Waste Management of San Diego, would take over half of the expanded program. 
</P>
<P>
Receiving the new service would be areas of Bay Park, Clairemont, Hillcrest, 
Mission Hills, North City West, Otay Mesa, Paradise Hills, Point Loma, Rancho 
Bernardo, San Carlos, Scripps Ranch, Skyline, Southeast San Diego, University 
City and Uptown. 
</P>
<P>
The areas were selected based on trash collection dates, access to freeways and 
other factors, including dividing the service among the eight council 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, curbside collections would be on regularly scheduled 
collection days. Residences would get free color-coded containers in which to 
put materials. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are not concerned about losing revenue to "scavengers," people 
who illegally take and sell materials left on curbsides before the city 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen some scavenging, but it is relatively small. We don't think it will 
have a major impact," said Ernie Anderson, deputy director in the city's Waste 
Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
The council's goal of recycling 25% of the city's annual trash load by 1992 is 
"definitely attainable," said Councilwoman Judy McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
Recent recycling efforts have extended the life span of the Miramar Landfill 
from 1995 to 2003, and a task force is trying locate sites for new landfills, 
McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're moving forward with our recycling efforts," the councilwoman added. 
"This is something that everyone should be doing, and now it will be much 
easier." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also will expand the types of materials that will be picked up for 
recycling to include a variety of paper products and plastic containers. 
Newspapers, glass, and aluminum and tin containers are now accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The November ballot proposal, which would require a majority approval, is 
designed to offset expenses of the expanded curbside recycling program and make 
all residents pay an equitable share for trash collection. 
</P>
<P>
Trash collection, which will cost the city about $25 million this fiscal year, 
is paid for from the city's General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the city's recycling services, set at $3.8 million in fiscal year 
1991, is partly paid for through landfill dumping fees. 
</P>
<P>
A grand jury report in May concluded that San Diego needs to undertake a 
massive recycling to extend use of its landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The report said San Diegans generate 3.5 million tons of waste annually, a rate 
that is increasing 10% a year, creating a "serious environmental problem" in 
establishing new landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling should be mandatory if voluntary efforts fail, the report concluded.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE IN AIR CONDITIONER CRITICALLY BURNS 2 MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two repairmen were critically injured Saturday at a Glendale convalescent home 
when a flash fire started in an air-conditioning compressor they were working 
on, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The repairmen, Alfred Galindo, 40, and Salvador Gallardo, 57, were in critical 
condition Saturday at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, hospital nursing 
supervisor Eric Chew said. 
</P>
<P>
They suffered second- and third-degree burns over 30% of their bodies as well 
inhalation burns caused from breathing the flames, said Susan Marchman, a 
dispatcher with the Glendale Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The men's names were being withheld until their relatives could be contacted. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 59 elderly patients at Dreier's Sanitarium in the 1400 block of 
West Glenoaks Boulevard were injured in the 1:25 p.m. explosion, nor was an 
evacuation of the building ordered, Marchman said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was out by the time firefighters arrived several minutes after it was 
reported, Marchman said. The fire started inside a utility shed in the 
building's parking lot and did not spread beyond the air conditioner, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marchman said one of the injured men works for the sanitarium and the other is 
employed by a private repair company.

DOCTOR GETS 3-YEAR PROBATION ON DRUG CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Torrance family doctor who surrendered his medical license after 
pleading no contest to illegally dispensing diet pills was sentenced to three 
years probation Thursday on a charge of cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Martin Bain, 62, pleaded no contest in May to the cocaine charge stemming 
from a November, 1988, traffic stop by a sheriff's deputy, who told officials 
that Bain was driving erratically on Palos Verdes Drive North. 
</P>
<P>
After stopping Bain, the officer said he found a syringe, a vial containing 
4.93 grams of liquid cocaine and other drug paraphernalia in Bain's car and 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Bain stopped practicing medicine last May after undercover medical regulators 
charged that he prescribed diet pills for them without first conducting a 
complete medical examination. He was fined $5,640 and placed on three years 
probation in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Bain told the judge on Thursday that he has retired from medicine, has put his 
practice up for sale and is training to become a real estate broker. A 
probation officer noted that he is living off more than $1 million in personal 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
Several friends, including Redondo Beach City Atty. Gordon Phillips, wrote 
letters of reference for Bain, praising him as an upstanding member of the 
South Bay community who took a bad turn after overworking himself for too long.

SNUB OF OXNARD REAL ESTATE TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the article "Oxnard's Identity Crisis" (Thursday). I honestly 
wish my efforts to attract real estate brokers to see Oxnard had generated a 
different result. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Inter-Neighborhood Council Committee representing Oxnard 
Shores and the Colony at Mandalay Bay, I was disappointed to read INCC 
Chairwoman Eleanore Branthoover's remarks that she couldn't be happier about 
not attracting land-buyers. I believe her remarks to be personal and not 
representative of INCC. 
</P>
<P>
Real-estate buyers are also borrowers for local lending institutions, are 
taxpayers for local governments, are consumers for local merchants, are 
advocates for preserving the quality of life that attracted them and us to the 
Channel Islands area in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
These real estate buyers are also employers or key employees who influence the 
future locations of their companies' facilities. Their decisions to locate 
businesses in the area create job opportunities for our citizens. Those 
companies become borrowers for local lending institutions, taxpayers for local 
government, "consumers" for local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"Fast-" or "slow-"growth positions are bad business and/or quality of life 
decisions. We need "thoughtful growth" which comes from having alternatives on 
how we grow and at what rate. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard -- indeed Ventura County -- is a fast train on its way to "discovery." 
Are we going to "engineer" the growth or let it run over us?

My husband and I have been fighting this abuse of the system for several years. 
We have spent many hours at the county government center reviewing reams of

There are hardly any other buildings around, let alone onlookers to watch and

It is McMann's job, with the help of a waist harness attached to the peak, to 
waterproof the framework for the tower of the new building on Skypark Drive in 
Torrance, just a stone's throw, so to speak, from Torrance Airport. HARRY CHASE

CONTAINER SHIP CAPTAIN ACCUSED OF INTOXICATION RELIEVED OF DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The captain of a container ship anchored in the Port of Los Angeles was 
relieved of duty when he was found intoxicated only hours before the vessel was 
scheduled to depart, Coast Guard officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The skipper of the Kaimoku, a 744-foot ship bound for Oakland, was discovered 
late Friday afternoon with a blood alcohol level of .26 -- more than six times 
the legal limit of .04 to operate a vessel, said Lt. (j.g.) Bill Drelling, a 
command duty officer at the Coast Guard's Los Angeles Marine Safety office. 
</P>
<P>
Drelling, one of the investigators involved in the case, said the unidentified 
captain's condition was first reported by two Coast Guard marine safety 
inspectors who had been examining a repair job on the ship. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two inspectors on board conducting a routine inspection," he said. 
"They got the impression the (captain) was intoxicated and called the 
investigators. The police . . . were called and they gave him a field sobriety 
and Breathalyzer test." 
</P>
<P>
After the tests, the captain was taken off his vessel and the ship was 
detained, said Drelling. He added that although the captain was not arrested, 
the case remains open. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still under investigation, and the end result could be an administrative 
hearing," Drelling said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kaimoku, owned by San Francisco-based Matson Navigation Co., left the port 
two hours after its scheduled departure for Oakland. The ship's chief mate, who 
also has a master's license, replaced the captain, Drelling said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the second in the last 16 months near the Los Angeles/Long 
Beach breakwater involving a ship captain accused of being drunk on duty. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the captain of a cargo ship was relieved of duty after being accused 
of being drunk at the helm as his vessel neared the Long Beach harbor 
breakwater. 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard report at the time indicated that panicked crew members on board 
the Century Hope had radioed for help after the 728-foot ship began weaving 
erratically. According to the Coast Guard, alcohol tests taken 5 1/2 hours 
after the incident showed that the ship's captain, Alan Jones, had a blood 
level of .07, although the Coast Guard calculated that his blood alcohol level 
was more than double that when the crew radioed for help. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a British citizen, conceded that he had had "one whiskey about an hour 
before sailing" but denied that he had put his ship at risk or was unfit to 
navigate.

GIFTS TO UCSD WILL FUND CANCER RESEARCH CHAIR, EXPAND SCRIPPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
University of California regents accepted more than $2 million in gifts to aid 
UC San Diego Friday. 
</P>
<P>
One will endow a cancer research chair at the medical school and the other will 
fund about a quarter of the cost of a building project at Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting at the UC Santa Cruz campus, regents accepted $250,000 to establish the 
Evelyn and Edwin Tasch Endowed Chair in Cancer Research. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the new position are being sought, a UCSD spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Tasch of Rancho Santa Fe donated the money in memory of her late 
husband, a retired New York businessman who died last year of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
He had been a patient at the UCSD Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
The other gift is $1.95 million from a foundation established by Texas 
Instruments founder Cecil H. Green of Dallas and La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
The gift will go toward the $7.3-million cost of an addition to the existing 
geophysics building at Scripps, and will be called the Cecil H. and Ida M. 
Green Geophysical Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
The Cecil and Ida Green Foundation for Earth Sciences has given previous gifts 
to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 
</P>
<P>
These include an international seismic network operated by Scripps; a 
geophysical observatory at Pinon Flat, Calif.; and a scholarship program that 
supports visiting scientists.

</P>
<P>
Trailing by six points late in the third quarter Friday, the West faced third 
and 10 from the East 39. Wallace, the West quarterback, rolled left, but his 
wall of offensive linemen caved in quickly. 
</P>
<P>
An instant before being leveled by a quartet of East players, Wallace flicked 
the ball off to his left without so much as peeking in that direction. A 
streaking Joey Tushnet snatched the flying football and dashed 35 yards to set 
up the West's tying touchdown. The extra point gave the team a 14-13 lead and 
the West eventually won, 20-13. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fluke," Wallace said of the pitch. "The opening came at the last 
moment and I pitched it. I couldn't do that in a million tries, but I did the 
one time it really counted." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Herrington, co-coach of the East, lamented, "I thought it was a lucky 
play, but the ball seemed to go right to the running back's hands." 
</P>
<P>
Tushnet had already hit full stride when he cradled Wallace's toss and cut 
toward the middle of the field. Several defenders lunged at him around the line 
of scrimmage, but the 5-foot-8 running back dodged them. Tushnet, who plans to 
join the Marines after playing baseball at Pierce College, broke two tackles 
downfield before finally being halted at the four-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"Joey's job is to stay in relation to the quarterback down the field," said Bob 
Francola, co-coach of the West. "Jesse doesn't have time to look around and 
see. Jesse told me later he didn't know if Joey was there, he just pitched it." 
</P>
<P>
Like a good Marine, Tushnet followed orders -- despite not believing that 
Wallace could get him the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think (Wallace) would get it off," Tushnet said. "He had about four 
guys on him so he threw me the ball. I was praying for it when he tossed it. At 
that point, I was hoping to make it to the end zone. Things were open almost 
all the way." 
</P>
<P>
When Tushnet, who finished with 63 yards in six carries, shifted into high 
gear, momentum shifted the West's way. 
</P>
<P>
The East had taken a 13-7 lead on big plays: a 53-yard punt return by John 
Johnson set up the team's first touchdown and a 77-yard option pass from 
fullback Jerome Casey to wide receiver Chad Miyata scored the second. 
</P>
<P>
The West, however, neutralized the numbing effects of those big plays with an 
electrifying play of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Said West running back Colin Havert: "We had started to get down when we 
couldn't move the ball, but that play just picked us right back up."

BAD LUCK PLAGUES VOGES; STANKOWSKI HOLDS LEAD HEADING INTO LAST ROUND; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: SIMI VALLEY MAN TUMBLES TO SEVEN OFF THE PACE IN SCGA AMATEUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER A THIRD-ROUND 75. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Not everything that could go wrong did go wrong for Mitch Voges on Saturday in 
the third round of the Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
He did not, for example, fall on a porcupine. Nor did a single one of the 
Wilshire Country Club's hundreds of towering palm trees topple onto his head. 
And not once in 18 holes of golf did a stranger walk up to him and poke him in 
the eye with a dart. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everything else, however, did go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Voges, 40, of Simi Valley, entered the round just a stroke off the lead in a 
strong bid to win the SCGA Amateur title for the first time. But he ended the 
day with a 3-over-par 75 and tumbled seven strokes behind the leader, Paul 
Stankowski of Oxnard. In all likelihood, the day spelled the end of his chances 
of winning the prestigious event. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm history," he said. "I'm too many strokes behind now. I knocked myself out 
of the game today." 
</P>
<P>
Not accurate. Voges actually played well, striking the ball just as well as he 
had on Friday when he posted rounds of 72 and 68. The difference on Saturday 
was a woman. Lady Luck. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days are like this," Voges said. "It's the agony of the game. Golf is not 
a fair game. It never has been. But I won't complain and I know I can't fight 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Voges' ill-fated day began with a marvelous pitching-wedge shot from about 100 
feet on the first hole. The ball landed just 10 feet from the flag. 
</P>
<P>
But then, churning with backspin, the ball retreated more than 30 feet, leaving 
Voges not with a decent birdie attempt but with a long and difficult putt just 
to set up a short putt for par. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have known what I was in for right then," Voges said. "That ball 
sucked back so fast I couldn't believe it. It was unbelievable. I knew then it 
might be one of those days. I was right." 
</P>
<P>
His misfortunes on the greens were highlighted by four birdie putt attempts 
that caught the lips of the cups and spun out. None of them were rolling very 
fast, but all circled the hole almost in slow motion and stayed out. It was, 
for Voges, agonizing. 
</P>
<P>
"Four putts lipped out today, and I haven't lipped out that many in months," he 
said. "I had all of them going at the right speed, dying at the hole. I didn't 
smash any of them. But out they came. There is just no explanation for that." 
</P>
<P>
And when the gods of the greens weren't jumping up to bite Voges on the nose, 
the gods of the fairways were. 
</P>
<P>
"It started on the fourth hole," he said. "I ripped a big tee shot and only had 
about 100 yards to the green. But the ball trickled off the fairway and stopped 
two feet into the rough. In six inches of grass. It was just impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Voges' woeful round left him at 215, seven strokes behind Stankowski -- who won 
the tournament last year -- six shots behind second-round leader Pat Duncan of 
Rancho Santa Fe and four strokes behind Bob Clark of Santa Ana, who matched 
Stankowski for the low round of the day with a 68. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Wi of Thousand Oaks, the 18-year-old who won the California Amateur 
Championship last month, came back with a round of 69 after opening rounds of 
73 and 76, but he was out of contention, 10 strokes behind Stankowski, whom he 
defeated in the semifinals of the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Zambri of Thousand Oaks shot a 73 and was at 217, nine shots off the 
lead. Chris Etue and Don Baker of Canoga Park were tied at 220 after shooting 
72s. 
</P>
<P>
But none was more disappointed than Voges. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing so well, I just couldn't believe I could come out here today and 
shoot a 75," he said. "I really expected to play well and score well today. I'm 
really surprised at what happened to me. And how it happened." 
</P>
<P>
His fall began on the sixth hole when he missed a three-foot putt for par and 
settled for a bogey. He bogeyed the ninth hole after pulling his tee shot into 
some trees. 
</P>
<P>
And on No. 10, the slide began in earnest. His tee shot on the par-3 hole came 
up short of the green, and his ball was lodged against a small clump of grass. 
His chip shot caught the grass and fell quickly, just halfway to the green. And 
then came one of his four lipped-out putts, and he had himself a fat 
double-bogey. 
</P>
<P>
His drive on No. 11 strayed just inches off the fairway and into a heavy patch 
of clover. He recovered, but lipped out putt No. 2, this one a slow, agonizing 
one that seemed to hang on the edge of the cup forever before spinning out. He 
took a bogey 5. 
</P>
<P>
On the 13th hole, he was the only player in the group that included Stankowski, 
Duncan and Clark to hit the par-3 green off the tee, stopping his ball just 13 
feet from the flag, and had a big chance to pick up a stroke on them. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Voges watched in disbelief, Clark first holed out a 50-foot blast from 
a sand trap for a birdie and then Duncan rammed in a 45-foot putt from off the 
green for his birdie. And suddenly, Voges had to make his putt just to keep 
from losing yet another stroke. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't. The putt caught the left lip of the cup and, maddeningly, spun out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a long day in the park," Voges said. "A long day with no fun. What a 
struggle. I felt like I was out there for 20 years today. When things go bad 
you draw the funny lies and the putts don't fall." 
</P>
<P>
But Voges, a veteran golfer and a winner of dozens of tournaments in his long 
golfing career, will be back today. In fact, the more he talked about his 
dismal round, the more his outlook improved. 
</P>
<P>
"I am as capable as anyone out here of getting hot and running the table," he 
said. "I need four or five or six birdies in a row and I could climb back into 
this thing. I'll have to shoot a 63 to win, but you know what? It can be done."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / JOHN LYNCH; 
</P>
<P>
OFF-COURT DISTRACTIONS PUT ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON BASKETBALL COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sudden departures of two area basketball coaches this summer may underscore 
a disturbing trend in high school coaching. 
</P>
<P>
When Marc Paez unexpectedly announced his resignation as the Cleveland High 
coach last month after just one season on the job, he leveled a broadside at 
such coaching pressures as recruiting, parental interference and the growing 
competition from unregulated spring- and summer-league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hoffman also abruptly ended his tenure as coach when he severed ties with 
Chaminade two weeks ago, just two months after he was hired. Hoffman, 34, had 
posted a 22-24 record at Calabasas in two seasons and was 12-10 at St. 
Genevieve in one season before replacing Mike Lynn at Chaminade in May. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said that a desire to spend time with his 3-year-old son and to 
concentrate on his baseball card store prompted the decision, but he also 
indicated that he sympathized with Paez. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have called me about work since I quit, but I'm not looking for a 
new job," he said Friday. "If I was interested (in coaching) I'd still be at 
Chaminade." 
</P>
<P>
But after two months with the varsity, Hoffman left, questioning his commitment 
to the profession. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been involved in basketball for 27 years and I'm going to put basketball 
on hold for a while," he said. "I agreed with a lot of the things that Paez 
said about the distractions. I'm not sure I want to get back into coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Add Chaminade: Hoffman's departure surprised the Chaminade players, according 
to Mark Wiltshire, one of two returning starters from last season's team. 
Wiltshire, a 6-foot-2 off guard, said he benefited from Hoffman's brief reign. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good coach and had helped me a lot," he said. "He was making us 
strong and united." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but not all the Eagles supported Hoffman. Some questioned his practice 
techniques and chafed under the demands the new coach placed on them, Wiltshire 
said. At least a couple of players had considered quitting the team, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of the younger players were having problems and complained that he 
expected too much out of us," he said. "But there were about eight of us that 
were working hard." 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil has upset Lynn, who resigned as coach at Chaminade after 11 
seasons. He also quit as athletic director and will move his family to 
Sacramento. He handpicked Hoffman and proclaimed in May that Hoffman was 
potentially one of the best coaches in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happening to the program is disappointing," Lynn said. "I put 11 years 
of my life into Chaminade and I can't walk away and say I don't care any more. 
I still respect Dave and we're friends. It's troubling to know the kids are 
struggling with this." 
</P>
<P>
Wiltshire claims the players have adjusted well to the loss of Hoffman largely 
because assistant coach Rob Kurowski has jumped into the breach. "He's not only 
a coach but a good buddy," Wiltshire said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's been a difficult time for Chaminade and Principal Tom Moran, the 
former St. Francis baseball coach who inherited the situation when he assumed 
his new post July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"My chair is not warm yet and I feel fortunate when I find my way back to my 
desk from the water cooler," Moran said. "I had heard good things about Dave as 
a coach and we're disappointed this happened. There's never a good time for 
these things, but it's better now than closer to the basketball season. We're 
going to take our time before we hire a new coach." 
</P>
<P>
New kid at the end of the block: One of the premier football positions in the 
area the past decade has been tight end at Hart. The tradition of talented 
players started with Darryl Ingram, a current member of the Minnesota Vikings 
who played at Cal. He starred for Hart in the early 1980s and played a key role 
in the team's championship season in 1983 when Hart defeated North Torrance for 
the Southern Section Coastal Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the decade, David Lee was a two-time All-Foothill League tight 
end who played baseball at USC. Brian Allen, a Times All-Valley selection, 
earned all-league recognition in 1987 and '88 and led Hart to a semifinal-round 
berth in the Northwestern Conference playoffs in '87. He plays at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Hart Coach Mike Herrington has moved one of the team's top athletes to the 
position, which may help to keep the tradition alive in the 1990s. George Kase, 
a 6-3, 230-pound senior, has drawn the attention of college recruiters for his 
play as a defensive end but will play on both sides of the ball this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"He concentrated on defense last year and was successful," Herrington said. "He 
could probably play on either offense and defense in college. He's fast and 
quick, and will catch his share of balls like all the tight ends at Hart." 
</P>
<P>
Where were these guys?: If anyone accuses Canyon Coach Harry Welch of 
recruiting, he'll gladly plead guilty. But instead of searching outside the 
Santa Clarita Valley for talent, Welch has focused his efforts on the Canyon 
campus, where his persuasive powers finally worked on three Canyon athletes who 
have joined the football team. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Troy Aldridge, a second-team All-Southern Section volleyball player, has 
joined the team as a receiver, and senior Matt Sinnott and junior Jim Zopalis 
have virtually nailed down jobs as the team's outside linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Welch's sales pitch this year carried an enticing twist. Not many 
coaches at Canyon can offer their players a road trip to Hawaii as part of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon is one of four area teams that will open the season in Hawaii next 
month. The Cowboys will join Crespi and Montclair Prep in Aloha Stadium in 
Honolulu Aug. 30 for games against Hawaiian teams. The next day, Chaminade 
plays Konawaena on the big island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the enthusiasm the trip has generated in Canyon Country -- the Cowboy 
contingent will reach 300 -- the trip has brought its headaches for a football 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest excursion in Santa Clarita history," Welch said with only 
slight exaggeration. "It's been nonstop around here and the kids have been 
caught up in the excitement. That's wonderful, but that's not what a football 
coach is thinking about. When you're thinking about Waikiki, you're not 
thinking about X's and O's."

Q &amp; A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Please let me know what Wall Street thinks about Union Carbide Corp. What is 
the present health of the corporation now that the accident in Bhopal, India, 
is behind it? -- Allentown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
A: You can always get information on the record from analysts who follow a 
company. But sometimes it is the off-the-record stuff that's more intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
One Wall Street source, who is very familiar with Carbide, says he doesn't 
expect much of an improvement in the company's earnings, mainly because its 
commodity chemical business is suffering along with the rest of that industry. 
And he doesn't expect an internal restructuring that could unlock some of the 
company's value. In short, says this source, "the management continues to screw 
up." He thinks that the stock could be worth more than $40 if a restructuring 
took place. It was selling at around $20 last week. 
</P>
<P>
The only hope for shareholders may be an unfriendly takeover attempt. And since 
junk bond, bust-up takeover bids by corporate raiders seem to be a thing of the 
past, the only potential buyer would be another chemical company or maybe an 
oil company. "Oil and chemical companies are the natural buyers, but they don't 
make unfriendly offers. And this would have to be unfriendly -- management 
likes its job," says my shy source. 
</P>
<P>
There are some admirers of Carbide, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out a 
few weeks ago. But for the most part, experts see a company whose earnings are 
slipping because of bad business conditions and because it is still paying off 
the restructuring it undertook a few years ago to escape a takeover attempt by 
GAF Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Seimer, a long-time chemical analyst now with Chemical Research Corp., 
expects Carbide's earnings to fall sharply to around $2.35 a share this year 
and down again in 1991 to around $2 a share. Carbide earned $4.07 a share in 
1989, even after a big extraordinary charge. 
</P>
<P>
Seimer is one of the more pessimistic analysts. According to Institutional 
Brokers Estimate System, the average estimate of all analysts who follow 
Carbide is for earnings of $2.67 a share this year. The most optimistic analyst 
thinks that earnings could be $3.80; the most dour prediction is $2.09. 
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for the stock all depends on a restructuring," says Seimer, 
echoing my off-the-record source. "Everyone is expecting that, at some point, 
(Carbide) will restructure itself." 
</P>
<P>
Seimer says the company might decide to sell its carbon products business and 
might spin off its industrial gases operation to shareholders. When? Probably 
not this year -- the company needs the cash that these businesses generate 
right now, Seimer says. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have made several attempts to check the status of certain savings and loan 
institutions in my area, with no success. I started with my senator and was 
given the phone number of a regulatory office in San Francisco. This office 
interrogated me as to my need for the information. 
</P>
<P>
I explained that I was investing in jumbo certificates of deposit and wanted to 
be sure that I was not putting the money in an S&amp;L that was in danger of 
being taken over. They told me that they could not give me the information I 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know if such information is available? Is it being kept secret? -- 
Malibu, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
A: Information as to which S&amp;Ls are in trouble certainly is being kept 
secret. If it weren't, there would probably be a run on all the unhealthy 
savings institutions in the nation, and the federal government would have an 
even bigger mess to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision, of course, has a list of all the 
nation's troubled S&amp;Ls. I asked a spokesperson whether the government would 
like to share that information with my readers. "Heck, no," was the reply, 
"because that would make them go under. And they are doing a good job at that 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
But there is hope. Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., a Wall Street investment 
firm, keeps very close tabs on the nation's banking and savings industry. The 
firm recently issued a major report on California thrifts. It also does reports 
on banks and S&amp;Ls in other regions. The firm has an office in San Francisco 
at (415) 434-3390. 
</P>
<P>
But the long and short of Keefe Bruyette's advice is: Put your money into one 
of three large California thrifts if you don't want to be troubled by a 
takeover. The firm considers Great Western Financial, Golden West Financial and 
H. F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. safe. 
</P>
<P>
But keep in mind that your deposits are insured up to $100,000, even if a 
thrift institution does get into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to know if a bond I have, drawn by the state of North Carolina 
and dated 1868, has a value as a bond rather than as a collector's item. -- 
Dunkirk, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
A: The bond appears to be worthless, according to Everett Chalk, assistant 
director of North Carolina's division of state finance. Here's why. 
</P>
<P>
When the American Civil War ended in 1865, carpetbaggers traveled south to make 
their fortunes. In many instances, Chalk says, they floated bond issues for 
projects that were never really intended to be built. It took an amendment to 
the Constitution, but the carpetbaggers' debt was generally repudiated by the 
Southern states, although some did pay off bonds at far less than their face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk says the bonds that you hold do not show up on his list of North Carolina 
securities that are redeemable. But he suggests that you write to him at the 
Department of the Treasury, 325 N. Salisbury St., Raleigh, N.C. 27603, for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My dad passed away recently and my mother found in his belongings shares of 
stock in a company called Cheyenne Resources Inc., dated Sept. 10, 1981. She 
would like to know if the company still exists. I've searched the public 
library, and looked through financial books and papers, but could not find any 
listing. -- Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
A: Cheyenne Resources does exist, but just barely. 
</P>
<P>
According to Robert Fisher of R. M. Smythe &amp; Co., the New York company that 
specializes in finding long-lost companies, "Cheyenne was incorporated under 
the laws of Wyoming and is still in existence." Its address is 3001 Henderson 
Drive, Suite A, Cheyenne, Wyo. 82001, (307) 632-6437.

LACKING PRIVATE INVESTMENT, GOVERNMENT AID IS NEEDED TO HELP BLACK 
ENTREPRENEURS GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a black attorney with a deep concern and commitment regarding black 
enterprise, I read with interest the June 26 article, "Black Entrepreneurs: 
Lost in the Crowd?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, I was a founder and vice president of the Los Angeles Area Economic 
Development Agency, a nonprofit corporation established to promote small 
businesses in Los Angeles County among blacks, minorities and the 
underprivileged. 
</P>
<P>
When this federal program was terminated in 1968, only four of the 100 small 
businesses initiated had failed. The 4% failure rate is a great achievement in 
view of the national failure rate of 85%. 
</P>
<P>
The success of this program was due in most part to the monitoring of the new 
business, including access to real estate brokers, accountants and consultants 
for the Small Business Administration, which supervised the program. 
</P>
<P>
The need for this type of program among blacks and minorities was due to the 
lack of investment funds. Metropolitan private banks and institutions were 
unwilling to invest in a black business, especially one without a successful 
track record. 
</P>
<P>
The article mentioned that immigrants frequently pool their resources to help 
each other. However, despite the success of a few blacks in the business arena, 
there are not enough of them to provide sufficient money to establish a 
business and keep it going until it reaches the break-even point. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that government funds to assist minorities are fast drying up without 
any alternative is leading to frustration in the black community.

ASIA BETTER WISE UP ON ISSUES OF CONSCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Asian Market Heats up for U.S. Furriers" (July 9) further convinced me that 
Asian consumers and business leaders need to work on their humanity. It also 
convinced me to make a greater effort to boycott Japanese and South Korean 
products; I'm sure glad I didn't buy that Acura Legend last year. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Americans and Europeans have become more aware of the cruelty and 
waste involved in utilizing both wild and "ranch-raised" animals, it's time to 
tap the consciences of those who will listen in Asia and to continue to wind 
down the entire existence of a fur trade in any country, especially the United 
States. Interestingly, it's also the Asians who continue to trade in illegal 
ivory, promote drift nets in the eastern Pacific and slaughter certain 
creatures for the aphrodisiac properties of some small part of their anatomies. 
</P>
<P>
With due respect for positive qualities in Asian countries, many U.S. consumers 
find all of that disgusting.

READERS HAVE THEIR SAY ON DANNEMEYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How terrible it would be if this wonderful, multifarious country were governed 
solely by the likes of William Dannemeyer, whose controlling vision encompasses 
only what suits his own needs. Posed at his tidy desk with cold eyes crinkled, 
Dannemeyer stares off into a vision of Utopian America born of an MGM back-lot 
fantasy -- a Mickey Rooney world of malt shops, town squares and manicured 
lawns that fronted perfect homes filled with well-fed, straight Caucasians. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sentimental illusion that perhaps only a white heterosexual male could 
get sentimental about. Meanwhile, the blacks, the gays, and all the others who 
only appear as noisy, amusing extras in such fantasies, have a different view 
of what's been lost and gained in this country. Dannemeyer says he sleeps at 
night. Of course he does. Anyone so out of touch would no doubt sleep like a 
baby.

Several times in the Dannemeyer piece, the word "sincere" is used to describe 
(or explain?) the representative's condemnation of anyone who does not live his 
lifestyle or hold dear his prejudicial attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
I don't recall ever meeting a bigot who wasn't sincere, unfortunately.

Thank God for William Dannemeyer. Perhaps we still have a few members left in 
Congress who aren't there to use drugs, line their pockets, womanize, hit the 
bottle, and who otherwise don't give a damn about their country. 
</P>
<P>
They only know how to spend our money and then scream for new taxes to bail 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer has the down-to-earth morals and principles I thought were 
completely gone from this Earth. He also has the guts to fight for them. 
</P>
<P>
Keep it up Rep. Dannemeyer. We need a few dozen more just like you, then we 
might return to a "Nation under God."

Rep. Dannemeyer claims that his views on homosexuality reflect probably 
three-fourths of the American people. However, a New York Times article on July 
10 -- "Studies Discover Clues to the Roots of Homophobia" by Daniel Goldman -- 
states that recent polls "show more Americans are beginning to accept 
homosexual men and women and support their rights". 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer's Proposition 102, his 1988 attempt to halt anonymous AIDS testing 
in California, failed at the polls. It even lost badly in his own conservative 
Orange County congressional district. Furthermore, because his embarrassing 
Prop. 102 was so at odds with the entire public health Establishment, including 
President Reagan's Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, the 1988 Bush presidential 
campaign dropped Dannemeyer as a surrogate speaker in California. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer is out of step with the societal change taking place in America: the 
increasing openness of gays and their becoming accepted even in his own 
Republican Party. In a recent flap within the California Republican Party over 
whether the gay Log Cabin Clubs should be thrown out, Dannemeyer again lost. 
Both Gov. George Deukmejian and U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson supported the continued 
inclusion of the gay clubs over Dannemeyer's vociferous objection. 
</P>
<P>
Since Dannemeyer is a self-avowed Christian, it's not too late for his personal 
redemption. Jesus Christ, the author of Dannemeyer's own religious faith, never 
ever spoke one negative word about gay men, lesbians or even about 
homosexuality, Dannemeyer's self-righteous obsession. In fact, Jesus frequently 
socialized with the outcasts of society, preferring them to the stiff-necked 
Pharisees, the conservative fundamentalists of his day.

SANTA MONICA AND VENICE BEACHES BREED THE TINY SAND CRABS THAT FISH CAN'T 
RESIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH HANANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To certain cognoscenti of fish bait, the waterline along the beach in Santa 
Monica and Venice is one of the Earth's special places. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every morning in summer and fall, they scour the low tide for fresh 
miniature sand mounds as the waves recede, stalking their quarry, Emerita 
analoga -- better known as the sand crab. 
</P>
<P>
Fanning across the surf lines, the crabbers scoop the mud, sifting it until 
they get their translucent 1 1/2-inch-long treasures. 
</P>
<P>
One of the top crabbers is 28-year-old Robert Pastel Jr. of West Los Angeles, 
who says he can catch 50 sand crabs an hour -- an ability that earns him 
near-legendary status among his fellow diggers. 
</P>
<P>
But just as not all fish eggs are caviar, neither are all sand crabs valued 
treasures. To anglers, the plankton-eating crabs are valuable only while they 
are molting, their tender bodies succulently soft during the several days it 
takes their new shells to harden. 
</P>
<P>
Put a molting sand crab on a hook, and fish will start biting within minutes. 
Put out an unmolted, hard-shelled crab, and a bite may not come for days. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Tarvyd, professor of marine biology at Santa Monica College, explains that 
shore fish "are genetically coded to eat sand crabs. Over tens of thousands of 
years, they have evolved digestive enzymes for this particular nutrient." They 
will almost always prefer a sand crab to any other bait. Earthworms, for 
example, are a foreign substance that some fish may find a acceptable 
substitute, Tarvyd said, but sand crabs are clearly the food of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Pastel agrees. At low tide, he says, he has seen barred surf perch, California 
corbina and young croakers "swim in with the white water, digging their heads 
in the sand, looking for crabs," sometimes in water so shallow that their eyes 
stick out above the surface. 
</P>
<P>
But finding molting crabs takes patience and persistence. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Crouch, curator at the Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro, estimates 
that in its two- to three-year life span, the average sand crab will molt an 
average of only 20 days -- a mere 2% of its life. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Santa Monica-Venice beach special, veteran crabbers say, is not 
just its high crab population but its high percentage of molting crabs. When he 
digs crabs with friends in Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach, Pastel said, his 
ratio is sometimes as poor as 100 hard-shelled crabs for every molting one. In 
Santa Monica, he said, about one out of every six sand crabs he digs up is 
molting. 
</P>
<P>
According to Crouch, the sand crab is native to the Western American coast from 
Alaska to Baja California, and is also found along the coast of Peru and Chile. 
Within this range, she said, certain spots -- such as Santa Monica -- have a 
combination of tides, currents, waves and sand that add up to ideal conditions 
for sand crabs to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
Sand crabs' lives, adds Crouch, are fraught with peril. Those that manage to 
avoid human and piscine predators are still in danger of being dug up and eaten 
by shore birds, such as the sanderling and the Western sandpiper. And sand 
crabs fleeing to deeper water are hunted by the larger spiny crabs.

shells.

LITTER: FREEWAY CLEANUP CREWS FIND THE DARNDEST THINGS -- FROM LOOSE CASH TO 
PHONE LISTS TO PLAYBOY MAGAZINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Litter pickup crews working the Foothill Freeway near Santa Anita Park have 
found so much cash that they have given the stretch a nickname: "The Money 
Strip." 
</P>
<P>
Bills of every denomination, it seems, blow from the car windows of 
horse-racing aficionados traveling to and from the Arcadia track. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week I found a dollar bill. Somebody else found a fifty and two 
twenties," said 20-year-old Tom Nguyen, dressed in the standard Caltrans orange 
hard hat and vest. 
</P>
<P>
On a blistering hot Thursday, he and 10 other Department of Transportation 
workers, most of them doing community service work instead of jail time for 
misdemeanor convictions or traffic violations, were picking their way through 
the trash-strewn oleander hedges along the Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
In a state where nearly 200,000 cubic yards of litter are collected in a year, 
cash is by no means the only thing thrown or blown from cars, trucks and 
motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
All finds go straight into the bright orange bags labeled CARE FOR CALIFORNIA. 
On a recent morning, the San Gabriel Valley booty included the resume of an 
actress ("HAIR: Honey blonde. EYES: Hazel Blue"), an onion peel, a yellow 
soccer ball, a sheet of sandpaper, a street map of San Diego, a dead pigeon and 
a 16-ounce cup from 7-Eleven with an emblem showing trash, litter basket and 
the words "Pitch In." 
</P>
<P>
"People throw it out as fast as we can pick it up," said Stan Lisiewicz, chief 
of Caltrans' maintenance field branch for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
State officials estimate that this year's litter pickup will cost the taxpayers 
$25 million, more than double what it cost four years ago. Nationally 
recognized litter expert Daniel Syrek of Sacramento says California's litter 
tab is closer to $100 million when adverse affects on tourism and property 
values are considered. 
</P>
<P>
For all its environmentalism, Syrek said, California lacks a comprehensive, 
preventive approach to litter. He has designed such programs for six states, 
including Texas, which started a "Don't Mess With Texas" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Litter isn't toxic in the classic sense," Syrek said. "It's probably not going 
to kill you, though there are some cases where it has caused deaths, such as 
spills on the highway. But we concentrate on what comes out of the exhausts. 
Why don't we concentrate on what comes of the windows too?" 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, when Caltrans picked up 155,000 cubic yards of trash, officials 
said that if the debris were put in dump trucks, it would fill a convoy 
reaching from San Diego to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although figures are not maintained for specific geographic areas, such as 
Pasadena, West Covina or La Verne, Caltrans officials estimate that in the 
northern half of the San Gabriel Valley alone, 100 cubic yards of trash -- or 
as much as 800 bags full -- are collected every week. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Caltrans office based in Bassett, which covers the southern 
half of the San Gabriel Valley and surrounding areas, takes in as much as 2,000 
bags of trash on some weekends. 
</P>
<P>
A key factor in the statewide litter program, especially in Los Angeles County, 
is the use of special programs in which community service workers are referred 
by the court and welfare systems. These crews do the work of 600 employees each 
year; statewide, they take the place of almost 3,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Without them, we'd probably be ankle deep in trash," Lisiewicz said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is impossible to keep roadways free of litter. "If we go through this 
area with a fine-toothed comb, it would take us forever. We've got too big of 
an area and too few people," Caltrans Foothill division foreman John Thome said 
as he surveyed scores of cigarette butts, apparently dumped from car ashtrays, 
in an area that his crew had cleaned minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"But it looks good at 55 m.p.h.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like a message in a bottle, litter creates roadside mysteries for the Caltrans 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
With pistol-grip, rubber-tonged forceps, Tom Nguyen hoisted an unopened can of 
Budweiser from the sun-beaten ivy near the Rosemead off-ramp in Pasadena. 
Maybe, he surmised, somebody tossed the beer because they saw a cop? 
</P>
<P>
With a "just-the-facts-ma'am" approach, he and several other Caltrans workers 
mused on the nature of litter on the 210 Freeway, a debris-lined Main Street 
for the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a young man working off a 60-day commitment in lieu 90 days in the 
county jail, retrieved parts of a shredded Bible and put them in his litter 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
He did not want to reveal his last name because he said he was embarrassed by 
his crime: being caught drunk and trying to break into a grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
As he disposed of Psalms, Proverbs and parts of the New Testament, he told of 
spending four days in jail before being given the choice of picking up litter. 
Sweating, he said: "This is better than jail." 
</P>
<P>
After looking at a crumpled $28.50 check from the account of a Pasadena couple 
who bank with Far East National in Alhambra, Martin stuffed it into his litter 
bag. The April 13, 1990, check, payable to the Home Shopping Club, was 
unendorsed. 
</P>
<P>
A major litter problem in the San Gabriel Valley is garbage-filled trucks, 
often uncovered, on their way to dumps such as Puente Hills, the nation's 
second-largest landfill, and others in West Covina and Azusa. "The trucks have 
got stuff boiling out," said Bud Jones, Caltrans Bassett supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
A big rig pulled onto the shoulder next to Martin. The driver stepped out, ran 
to the truck bed and pulled a board from the side. "This was about to fall 
off," he said, handing Martin a board with nails in it. 
</P>
<P>
After the truck drove away, Martin said: "They say, when you first start, maybe 
you'll find money or a dead body or Playboys. Sure enough, I found one, a 
Playboy." 
</P>
<P>
(It was a magazine, he explained, not a dead playboy.) 
</P>
<P>
Martin said, "You find family pictures out here too." 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later he plucked from the shoulder a color photograph of a 
squinting, grinning, bald baby in a stroller. 
</P>
<P>
Just as there are said to be no atheists in foxholes, no one on a cleanup crew 
is a litterbug. "I've thrown out bottles and beer cans," Martin said. "I'll 
think about it before I'd do that again. I'm for Greenpeace and all that -- 
saving the rain forest -- but I never paid any attention to litter." He spoke 
above the roar of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"These freeways are a mess. People should realize how much harm they are doing 
to the environment. Pretty soon, we'll just have to make a landfill out of the 
whole place." 
</P>
<P>
A business-sized sheet of purple paper stood out from the other debris. Martin 
snapped it up. 
</P>
<P>
It belonged to one Cheryl Chase of Burbank. Smudged and slightly torn, the 
single sheet testified to the brief motion picture, television and theater 
career of the 31-year-old actress, who these days is auditioning in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted by telephone there Thursday, she said she had no clue as to how a 
copy of her resume ended up on the Foothill Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow!," she said. "The what freeway? Is the resume purple? I must have been 
visiting my aunt in Sylmar. Where's Arcadia? I wonder if it blew all the way 
there? I live in Burbank. It must have been a miracle. Or a pigeon. Maybe I 
submitted it for an audition. I was a crazy person, driving all around last 
month. Maybe I gave it to somebody and they threw it out."

FOR GEORGE C. PAGE, THE PITS ARE A PLEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The museum at the La Brea tar pits exists because of an orange. 
</P>
<P>
Early in this century, when George C. Page was a 12-year-old schoolboy in his 
native Nebraska, a teacher gave him an orange from California. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so awed by the beauty of that piece of fruit that I said I hope someday 
I can live where that came from," Page, now a trim, energetic 89, recalled in 
an office of the Hancock Park museum that bears both his name and his personal 
stamp. 
</P>
<P>
At 16, Page hitchhiked to Los Angeles with $2.30 in his pocket, living on 
Hershey bars and 10-cent bowls of bean soup fortified with crackers and 
ketchup. He knew no one here, but "any place that produced that piece of fruit 
must have merit," he believed. He got work as a busboy, although he was so 
naive that at first he thought the job involved driving a bus. 
</P>
<P>
On his single day off each week, Page did what many curious young Angelenos 
with little money did for fun. He went to the ostrich races in Pasadena -- once 
he and a bunch of his pals shared a scrambled ostrich egg. He went to Busch 
Gardens, formerly in Van Nuys. And one day he went to Hancock Park to see the 
oozing pools of asphalt famous around the world as the La Brea tar pits. 
</P>
<P>
Fascinated by the puddles that had trapped saber-toothed cats, mastodons and 
other ancient animals, he was dismayed to learn that the only way he could see 
the fossilized bones was to travel seven miles to the Museum of Natural History 
in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
"What a pity they haven't been exhibited on the site where they were found," he 
thought. Then, he recalled, "a half-century goes by before I'm in a position to 
do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
What Page did about it was to give Los Angeles a $4-million museum for its La 
Brea treasures, a unique cache of thousands of remains, some caught in the 
lethal goo 40,000 years ago. But, more than that, he shaped the George C. Page 
Museum of La Brea Discoveries, which opened in 1977, bringing his years of 
experience in marketing and packaging to the building and its contents. 
</P>
<P>
Although Page never went to business school (his formal education ended with 
eighth grade), he knows packaging. When he was 17, living in a $3-a-month attic 
room in downtown Los Angeles, working days busing tables and nights jerking 
sodas, he started the company that would make his fortune. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to send a box of California fruits to his mother and brothers back 
in Nebraska as a Christmas gift. He artfully lined the box with red paper and 
decorated it with tinsel. The teen-ager's gift was so attractive that 37 other 
roomers in his boarding house offered to pay him "what's right" to make up 
similar boxes to send back to their Midwestern families. The result was Mission 
Pak, the gift-package company Page operated until 1946. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, to open the purse, you had to appeal to the eye," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his professional life, Page was always aware of the power of 
attractive packaging. On a trip to France when he was 21, he saw a new material 
called cellophane and grabbed up as much as he could to beautify his gift 
baskets. He once operated a small business that made spiffy auto bodies to 
upgrade the appearance of battered but functional cars. And, as a developer, he 
was sensitive to the importance of landscaping in enhancing the value of a 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Page wanted to create a setting for the La Brea fossils that would "be right 
for the subject and something that was different and outstanding." He rejected 
the proposals of five established architects whose designs included a kind of 
open-air circus tent and a gigantic three-leafed clover. On the recommendation 
of a friend, he talked to two young men not long out of architecture school: 
Willis E. Fagan and Franklin W. Thornton. Using their own limited funds, the 
pair spent a month touring the museums of America, asking professionals what 
they would do differently if they could re-create their institutions. Finally, 
they came to Page with a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"You've taken them out of the ground here," the young architects said of the La 
Brea discoveries. "Why don't we put them back in?" 
</P>
<P>
They proposed building a burial mound for the collection, a museum half 
underground to conserve energy and to keep the park grounds as intact as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Once construction was under way, Page got a trailer and was on the site at 7 
o'clock every morning, including Christmas, for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Page was only committed to paying for the museum's shell. But it 
soon became clear that if he wanted to see the museum operating in his 
lifetime, he would have to do more than that. 
</P>
<P>
He is not impressed by how long it takes the county to get things done nor how 
much it ultimately costs. 
</P>
<P>
"What they do," he said, "is they call in an expert, and he calls in an 
assistant expert." 
</P>
<P>
Page used his money and energy to streamline the process. "I happen to be a 
persistent cuss," he said, "and when I start something, I finish it." 
</P>
<P>
He was horrified when he first saw them at how the La Brea discoveries had been 
displayed at the Museum of Natural History. The skeleton of the imperial 
mammoth was propped up with plumbing pipes, and the bones fell with every 
good-sized tremor. Even worse, in his view, "they had the 9,000-year-old woman 
stretched out on plywood, covered with dust, and the kids would look at her and 
yawn." 
</P>
<P>
"I was determined to breathe life into every exhibit," he said. If the fossils 
were not exhibited skillfully, he feared, visitors would see nothing but 
"bones, bones, bones." 
</P>
<P>
Page was especially concerned about displaying the bones of the woman -- the 
only human remains found in the tar pits -- to maximum effect. He makes it 
clear that not everyone appreciated the fact that he, an amateur and a 
non-scientist, had strong views on the museum's displays. 
</P>
<P>
There were those at the parent museum, he said, who wondered "how can a man 
who's been lucky in the jungle of commerce presume to arrange a museum in a 
professional manner?" Eyebrows were raised, he said, when he sought advice -- 
not from the museum but from the Walt Disney Co. -- on displaying the 
9,000-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
Page approached the creator of the spectral figures for Disneyland's Haunted 
Mansion attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"There's what is known as Pepper's ghost," Page was told, describing an optical 
illusion in which an object seems to turn into another image and back again. As 
a result of that conversation, when visitors to the museum look into a dark 
case containing a cast of the ancient woman's skull atop a modern woman's 
skeleton, the bones seem to become a young girl. 
</P>
<P>
The effect is created with the composite skeleton, a model of a young Indian 
woman with long, black hair, careful lighting and a piece of plate glass. (The 
17 bones actually belonging to the 9,000-year-old woman are in the museum's 
ossuary.) A similar display shows a skeleton seemingly transformed into a 
snarling saber-toothed tiger. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidently I've done it right, because the kids squeal with ecstasy," Page 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the objections of purists, the museum features a "dinosaur theater," where 
visitors can see a short film about that most-charismatic of creatures. No 
dinosaur bone has ever been found at the tar pits, but virtually every visitor 
to the museum expects to see their remains. Page thinks the youngsters who come 
by the thousands should be educated, not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Page also insisted that there be two theaters, not one, so visitors can see an 
explanatory film about the tar pits. "People don't like to wait," he said. The 
theaters are next to the entrance because Page says he thinks visitors should 
have a vivid image of what life was like in Los Angeles of the Ice Ages before 
they see the inanimate remains in the rest of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
In Page's view, pictures are far better than words at engaging the public. He 
likes pithy explanatory cards, not epics, next to exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to put a book on the card," he said. He is also proud of the way 
that painted backgrounds, showing the La Brea "monsters" as they were in life, 
flesh out exhibits of skeletons and plaster models. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Hancock Park, Page is a hands-on patron who continues to keep 
close tabs on the museum. When natural asphalt proved inappropriate for a 
display that shows visitors how strong the sticky stuff can be, he found a 
chemist to develop a synthetic version that didn't harden up like the real 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"When they have these problems come up, they call George," he said. When he 
walks through the museum, he notices everything from the health of individual 
plants in the atrium garden -- "That sego lily looks a little sick," he warned 
the gardener -- to the condition of the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
The carpet is emblematic of his ongoing involvement. Page wanted carpet, not 
marble or ceramic tile, on the floor because it is more comfortable to walk on. 
</P>
<P>
He thought the present carpet would stand up well when he chose it 13 years 
ago. And he's glad he got a 10% overrun: It's proved invaluable for repairing 
spots damaged by high heels. 
</P>
<P>
But 13 years is 13 years, and half a million people walk on that carpet every 
year. Recently, Page said, he heard that a European manufacturer has developed 
an ultra-durable tile that might be just the thing for the museum floor.

STAR CLUB GETS ITS CASE ON TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Culver City discount electronics store, stung by a major distributor's 
accusations that it was trying to pass off refurbished goods as new, struck 
back at its accuser with a sting of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Star Club, a discount shop on Sepulveda Boulevard, has sued Canon USA Inc., the 
American distributor of products by Canon, the Japanese maker of photographic, 
video and office equipment. 
</P>
<P>
To bolster their contention that authorized Canon dealers were disseminating 
what they say are unfounded allegations against Star Club, owner Aviv Mizrahi 
and his brother Alon mounted an impromptu sting operation. They posed as 
customers at competing stores and, using a floor-model camcorder, videotaped 
the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
One tape they submitted to a judge shows a Canon sales representative repeating 
the accusations. On the basis of the tape and other information, the brothers 
obtained a Los Angeles Superior Court order last August barring further 
dissemination of the allegations made in a letter from a Canon regional sales 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents and the attorneys involved, it was in July, 1989, 
that the Canon manager wrote to several authorized Canon dealers that Star Club 
was selling, as new, video cameras that had been refurbished and were not 
covered by Canon's U.S. warranty -- allegations that Star Club denies. The 
letter, from Glenn Scharaga, video division sales manager for Canon's Western 
States region, said this had been discovered from a tracing of camcorder serial 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"Please advise your customers not to purchase these units (from Star Club)," 
which is not an authorized Canon retailer, Scharaga wrote. 
</P>
<P>
When the Mizrahi brothers heard about the letter from comparison-shopping 
customers, they went shopping themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Having learned from an advertisement that a Canon sales representative would be 
on hand to show off some Canon products, Aviv and Alon Mizrahi went to Audio 
Video City in Culver City. As one of the brothers worked a demonstration Canon 
camcorder, the other discussed camcorder prices with sales representative Russ 
Avisson and mentioned that the same model at Star Club cost "a couple hundred 
dollars less" and was backed by a good warranty. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not an authorized dealer, and he's selling open refurbished goods," the 
videotape shows Avisson replying. "They (Audio Video City) are not going to 
match prices with that. That's like buying a brand new Cadillac and then coming 
back and saying, 'I found a Cadillac for half the price, but it's four years 
old and it's got 100,000 miles.' " 
</P>
<P>
Avisson referred to a copy of Scharaga's letter that was on display. "Canon 
does not even honor (Star Club's) warranty," he told the Mizrahis. 
</P>
<P>
The sting operation was repeated at four other authorized Canon retailers, 
three on the Westside and one in the San Fernando Valley, Alon Mizrahi said. In 
each shop, Scharaga's letter, framed, was sitting on the sales counter, Mizrahi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Star Club filed its suit seeking unspecified damages in August charging Canon, 
Scharaga, Avisson and the authorized dealers with unfair competition, libel, 
slander, interference with its business and antitrust violations. A trial is 
expected this fall in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Star Club is drumming up attention to its cause. It played the sting 
video on big-screen TVs at a news conference earlier this month at the store, 
which drew, among others, a Japanese television station and newspaper. Loyal 
customers stood by for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a publicity stunt," Canon's attorney, Carl W. Shapiro, said of the 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to clear my name," Aviv Mizrahi said. 
</P>
<P>
Star Club sees the situation as nothing less than a campaign by Canon to 
eliminate it as a competitor to Canon's authorized dealers. The 5-year-old 
store, which sells below manufacturers' suggested retail prices and will not 
quote prices over the telephone, is "a real force in the retail market here," 
Star Club attorney Paul H. Rochmes said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I sell at a volume basis, I believe I will be able to sell at a heck of a 
lot less than the manufacturer's (suggested price)," Aviv Mizrahi said in an 
interview. "If I would decide to make less profit, it's my business. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would a major Japanese company like Canon pick on me?" 
</P>
<P>
Canon attorney Shapiro insisted that there was no vendetta against Star Club. 
Plenty of retailers sell at discount, he noted. Canon believes that "authorized 
dealers are able to provide better services and support" to customers, he said. 
"But Canon as a company does not go out and attack unauthorized dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an isolated incident by a local sales manager," Shapiro said, and only 
when Star Club filed suit did Canon's headquarters learn of Scharaga's letter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of those things you don't anticipate happening," Shapiro said. 
"Canon would have preferred if (Scharaga) would have checked with someone" 
before he sent the letter. The regional sales manager, as well as sales 
representative Avisson, have been "counseled," but they remain in their 
positions at Canon, Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Scharaga, at Canon's offices in Costa Mesa, declined to comment, other than to 
read a statement issued by Canon headquarters in New York: "The employee 
involved and the person who wrote the letter acted on information they believed 
to be accurate. . . . Without admitting or denying the allegations . . . such 
alleged behavior by its employees has never been approved by Canon management 
and would never be condoned." 
</P>
<P>
As for the video, Shapiro said, the Star Club representatives "goaded the 
people into making statements." 
</P>
<P>
Star Club says its reputation has been sullied, and the lawsuit alleges that 
the resulting loss of sales and profits exceeds $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although he insisted that sales have suffered at the store, Star Club President 
Isaac Ziv declined last week to disclose any sales figures. He said camcorders 
account for about one-quarter of the store's business, which also includes 
televisions, VCRs, boom boxes, telephone answering machines and stereos. 
</P>
<P>
"Before a person is going to spend $1,000 on a camcorder, he will go and shop 
around. And when you shop around in other stores and see such a letter, would 
you go to buy at Star Club? We have no idea how many people saw that letter -- 
hundreds, maybe thousands," Ziv said. 
</P>
<P>
Aviv Mizrahi said: "We'll never, never be able to know how bad it (sales) was 
affected." 
</P>
<P>
Canon attorney Shapiro responded, "They haven't come forward with any evidence 
of any injury to their business," such as sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
Ziv, who manages the store's day-to-day operations, said that even now, nearly 
a year after Canon retracted the letter under court order, "if (we get a call 
from a potential customer about) a camcorder, the second question is if that 
merchandise is new." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE STAR CLUB STING 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some excerpts from the sting videotape recorded by Star Club owner 
Aviv Mizrahi and his brother, Alon. 
</P>
<P>
Alon Mizrahi: What do you mean when you say that if you find a better price 
within a month, you can come back? 
</P>
<P>
Russ Avisson, Canon sales representative: Yeah, they guarantee their prices. 
</P>
<P>
Alon Mizrahi: But we found, in Star Club. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Avisson: But that's not an authorized dealer, and he's selling open refurbished 
goods. They (authorized dealers) are not going to match prices with that. 
That's like buying a brand new Cadillac and then coming back and saying, "I 
found a Cadillac for half the price, but it's four years old and it's got 
100,000 miles." 
</P>
<P>
Aviv Mizrahi: The guy tells me he has an American warranty. 
</P>
<P>
Avisson: He can tell you whatever he wants to tell you. I don't know what he's 
telling you. . . . All it is I know is that we have traced back serial numbers 
and we found out that he's selling goods that do not have a United States 
warranty, and they are refurbished goods. So it's your choice. . . . But that's 
what the factory found out. 
</P>
<P>
Aviv Mizrahi: Give us your best price. 
</P>
<P>
Avisson: Well, it's marked here, $1,299. That's the suggested price. What have 
you found so far? 
</P>
<P>
Alon Mizrahi: Star Club was much cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
Avisson: Yeah, but Star Club is not even selling you new goods. So I'm not even 
going to consider those guys. . . . He does no warranty. If it's a warranty, 
it's his own, because Canon does not even honor his warranty. 
</P>
<P>
Aviv Mizrahi: You're sure? 
</P>
<P>
Avisson: You just read the letter.

GROWTH KEY ISSUE IN SEWER PACT REVISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than two dozen cities and agencies, including a sewer district serving 
portions of Pasadena, South Pasadena and Alhambra, are preparing to negotiate 
new sewer contracts with the city of Los Angeles that officials predict will 
mean higher rates for residential, commercial and industrial users in most of 
those areas. 
</P>
<P>
The new contracts, moreover, may give the Los Angeles City Council the power to 
monitor -- and perhaps stymie -- planned development in some of its neighbor 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming negotiations represent the most ambitious effort yet to 
standardize and make more equitable Los Angeles' agreements with so-called 
contract cities and agencies, some of which have been dumping waste into its 
sewer system under contracts that date to the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
The talks will also give Los Angeles a chance to bring the contracts in line 
with federal clean-water regulations that have been hanging over the city's 
head for more than a decade. State officials charged with enforcing those 
regulations have threatened to withhold sewer-related grants from the city -- 
estimated at $50 million over the next five years -- if the contracts are not 
updated. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are not expected to begin before September, but potentially 
troublesome issues have emerged in preliminary talks. Key among them is the Los 
Angeles City Council's intention to use the new sewer agreements as a 
growth-control tool with the contract cities and agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The council, at the request of members Marvin Braude and Ruth Galanter, voted 
this month to require all cities and agencies with new sewer contracts to 
furnish Los Angeles with regular reports about zoning changes and building 
permits. The council also voted to give itself, rather than city staff, control 
over contract cities' and agencies' requests for additional capacity in the 
sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Refusing such a request could thwart development in a community covered by a 
Los Angeles sewer contract. 
</P>
<P>
"The interest of the city is in controlling the regional decisions that are 
made," Braude said at a recent council committee meeting. "Those are going to 
be the key decisions in the next decade. . . . If the city had utilized its 
power more aggressively (in the past), we could have limited the growth in the 
Malibu area and prevented congestion on Pacific Coast Highway, we could have 
controlled what goes on in the Marina del Rey area in a much more effective 
way, and perhaps other areas, as well." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is already locked into legal disputes with several contract cities 
that have refused to comply with similar reporting requirements for zoning 
changes and building permits, clauses in a temporary sewer-limitation ordinance 
the council passed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of El Segundo, Culver City, Burbank, Glendale and others have accused 
Los Angeles of trying to exert too much influence over their cities' affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our perception is that Los Angeles is using the (federal clean-water 
regulations) to change a lot of other things in the contracts," said Ora 
Lampman, director of public works in Burbank. "The Los Angeles City Council is 
apparently looking for some type of land-use controls of areas outside its city 
boundaries. Our position is that Los Angeles doesn't have any authority to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said grumbling from the contract cities and agencies is to be 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't criticize them for that," she said at a recent council committee 
meeting. "It is their job to maintain as much autonomy and control as they can, 
but it is our sewer system, and they are buying into it." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials predict that the new agreements, to take effect next 
summer, will earn the city an additional $80 million over 10 years, mostly from 
higher sewer fees. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials have been unable to say how much the new contracts will 
cost each client community, but bills are expected to go up across the board 
because the city intends to pass along costs associated with the $3.4-billion 
renovation of the Hyperion sewage treatment plant at El Segundo. The expansion 
and upgrading project at Hyperion, begun in 1987, is due to be completed in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
For years, sewer users within Los Angeles and some contract areas have been 
subsidizing those in other contract areas because many agreements do not 
adequately cover the cost of services, officials said. One of the goals of the 
contract talks, they said, is to treat all users alike. 
</P>
<P>
"The contracts are so old they are just not reflective of the system that the 
city now operates," said Jim Gratteau, head of financial management for the 
county Sanitation Districts. Gratteau's agency has several agreements with the 
city, including one covering western portions of Pasadena, South Pasadena and 
Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Los Angeles and its contract cities and agencies have been 
meeting for more than two years to prepare for the formal contract talks, which 
both sides acknowledge are likely to be rocky at times. Several officials have 
said privately that they expect to end up in court before the negotiations are 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is trying to jockey for position," said one negotiator for a contract 
city. "Each agency is trying to minimize its costs. The city of Los Angeles is 
sitting all alone on the other side of the table." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations at first were to open late last year, but delays in drafting a 
model contract -- to serve as the city's starting point with each of the 29 
contract cities and agencies -- have pushed the opening session into September. 
The delay means that the city will not be able to keep its promise to state 
officials that new contracts would be approved by Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, no one knew how complex this would be," said Fred Hoeptner, a 
senior civil engineer for Los Angeles who is overseeing the talks. "It is 
something you do once in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
State officials, increasingly impatient with the slow progress toward talks, 
announced last week that they will impose a new deadline for meeting the 
federal clean-water regulations after the first round of negotiations is over. 
Frank E. Peters of the State Water Resources Control Board said he may "have no 
alternative but to stop payments" on grants to the city because "cooperation 
seems to be dwindling" between the city and the contract groups. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the federal guidelines, the city must base its charges on both the 
volume of sewage flowing into the system and the strength of the flow. Current 
charges are based on volume only, so cities that dump particularly strong 
effluent requiring extra treatment pay the same rate as cities dumping waste 
that is more easily treated. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed rate structure, for example, Burbank would have to pay 
higher fees than Beverly Hills because Burbank dumps concentrated sludge into 
the Los Angeles system, while Beverly Hills dumps mostly residential effluent, 
which is less costly to treat. This difference is not considered in the rates 
the two cities now pay. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations also require the city to revamp the contracts so that each 
agency pays a fair share of construction, operation and maintenance costs of 
the system, and that users of the three treatment plants within the Hyperion 
system are treated equitably. 
</P>
<P>
Although the contract cities and agencies say they want a more equitable fee 
system, Los Angeles city officials predicted that the transition will not be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
"The agencies are going to be most concerned about the bottom line," said 
Hoeptner, the Los Angeles engineer overseeing the negotiations. "They are not 
going to be too concerned about fairness and consistency. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the dollars. . . . No matter what system is implemented, some will be 
winners and some will be losers. There is no way of avoiding that."

ISSUES OBSCURED IN HOTEL COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its coverage of the proposed luxury hotel on the Santa Monica beach 
(Westside, July 15), The Times has placed too much emphasis on personalities 
and not enough on the public policy dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The first issue is the impact of private development on the public environment. 
Building a $300-a-night hotel on public parkland is a bad idea. Nearly 50% of 
California's beaches are in private hands already. 
</P>
<P>
This non-essential project will generate 3,000 more vehicle trips per day on 
the already-choked Pacific Coast Highway. It will pollute the air with 
construction dust in excess of allowable levels for two years. It will increase 
the sewage flow from 11,000 to 25,000 gallons per day on a sewage system 
already past its limit. Water usage will increase from 24,000 to 45,000 gallons 
per day while the rest of us are trying to conserve. 
</P>
<P>
The second issue is whether we should exploit a finite environmental resource 
to generate revenue for social programs. The hotel purports to provide "public 
access," mainly through a community center, showers, a restaurant and a 
sculpture garden -- token gestures to buy support for the luxury purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is defended as a cornucopia of revenue for beach cleanup, local 
schools, parks and other social programs. The Times repeats the developer's 
false claim that these benefits will total $3 million per year. In fact, the 
owners are relieved of providing full guarantees after the first year, and the 
rest of the benefits depend on a booming 80% occupying rate and a 
three-year-old economic analysis that was prepared when hotels were more 
profitable than they are now. If the hotel goes bust, the mortgage holder is 
not required to provide the key public access promises. 
</P>
<P>
Why not turn to general revenue or fees to clean up the beach? Why pay for 
schools and homeless programs by exploiting public parklands? The "logic" is 
folly when you consider that environmental resources are limited and the cost 
of social programs is unending. Why not sell off the rest of the environment to 
pay for the city's social agenda? 
</P>
<P>
There is no need for what the developer himself calls a "Bel-Air Hotel on the 
beach." We have a duty to preserve our threatened environment and pay for 
programs through the open budget process.

PRESERVATION AND PROPERTY RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've maintained my home in Hollywood for 40 years, still enjoy it despite many 
changes it has undergone over that span of four decades. 
</P>
<P>
I read with interest of the efforts of the city's Cultural Heritage Commission 
to "save" the building at 1717 Vine St. that housed the Ontra Cafeteria (Times 
Westside, Sunday, July 1). 
</P>
<P>
That building, the home of Hollywood's first post office, was destroyed by fire 
a few months ago. The city has demanded of the building's owner, who already 
has a considerable investment in the property, that he invest still more to pay 
for earthquake reinforcement. The owner has decided instead to level the 
structure and put a parking lot there. Incredibly, the commission forced the 
owner to secure a court order to make that use of his own property. Superior 
Court Judge William Masterson reached the sound and correct conclusion that the 
commission had, indeed, abused its authority in declaring that the structure is 
a historic monument, thus shielded from destruction by its owner. 
</P>
<P>
Displeased with the only logical and lawful decision the court could make, the 
commission's chairman complained that "The judge has made the wrong decision, 
without (even) looking at the building." Had His Honor looked at the building, 
he'd have been all the more certain that its owner should not be restrained 
from leveling it to make way for a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know the commission chairman or the property owner. My concern is the 
commission's utter disregard for the latter's rights and for inexcusable waste 
of taxpayer monies to defend the commission's groundless actions. To me, it is 
clear that the commission needs some personnel changes.

TOLERANCE OF UCLA DEVELOPMENT URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a longtime resident of Westwood and a UCLA graduate, I have followed with 
interest the articles concerning planned development of the UCLA campus and 
reactions from the community, which at times have been hostile. I would like to 
urge a fairer, more balanced view. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA by any standard has made tremendous strides and has developed into one of 
the finest academic institutions in the world. Its contributions to Los Angeles 
are incalculable. I applaud UCLA for its achievements and continued 
contributions to the intellectual and cultural life of Los Angeles. I 
congratulate their athletic teams for their accomplishments and for the 
enjoyment provided to their fans. Recognition must also be given to the 
important role provided by the UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Any vital organization must be permitted to grow with the growth of our 
community and must be permitted to adjust with the changes in our society. 
Accordingly, I urge tolerance for reasonable construction growth and 
development at UCLA in recognition of the tremendous value and benefit Los 
Angeles receives through UCLA's existence.

Reader Tip of the Week From Philip Drucker, Los Angeles: "In Europe, I saw an 
ad in a Munich newspaper that promised inexpensive lodging in and around 
Prague. The company, PASAT, delivered a room for three persons 10 minutes from 
the center of Prague for the equivalent of $7 a night. PASAT also pointed out 
the city's many attractions. The owner speaks English. His list of offerings: 
rooms in private homes or hotels, tickets for cultural and sports events, 
language programs, exchanges between sports teams and cultural groups, etc. In 
addition, PASAT helps with plans for vacationers wishing to go horseback riding 
or needing car rentals. Contact PASAT, Vaclav Blaha, Na Vyspe 8, 14700 Prague 
4, Czechoslovakia."

Mexico Without Stress: C.E. of Del Mar asks for the name of a "quiet village in 
Mexico that's low-key but with atmosphere." Our vote goes to Copala. In the 
Sierra Madre range about 40 miles east of Mazatlan. Takes about an hour by car 
or bus. Donkeys share the cobbled streets. Visitors check in at the little 
five-room Hotel Posada San Jose. Excellent Mexican meals. You dine in the 
patio. The menu lists eggs ranchero, enchiladas and a plate that's loaded with 
tortillas, tacos, tamales. The beer is cold and the service is top-notch. 
Others choose Daniel's, a restaurant on the approach to town. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Posada San Jose faces a plaza and the church of Copala. After 400 years, 
little has changed in this village, which was founded by the Spaniards. 
Wrought-iron lamps line the square. The tolling of bells can be as startling as 
thunder. A fine retreat for travelers looking to escape crowded coastal 
resorts. No night life. Only one cantina. Copala is the colonial town that 
Puerto Vallarta once was -- only without an ocean. 
</P>
<P>
For the latest on Copala, contact the Mexican Government Tourism Office, 10100 
Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 224, Los Angeles 90067. Telephone (800) 262-8900 or 
(213) 203-8191.

VIDEO EVOLUTION MEANS TRAVELING CAMCORDERS NO LONGER FORCED TO PLAY THE ROLE OF 
HEAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEFFINGWELL, Leffingwell is a Times staff photographer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time was when home video stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
The early video cameras were bulky, two-piece affairs that prompted bystanders 
to wave in the background and ask what channel they were going to be on. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, is the era of the two-pound, one-piece camcorder that fits in a 
large handbag yet packs more features than some studios offered a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
With plenty of options available -- tapes alone come in six formats -- a 
vacationer should talk with a knowledgeable salesperson before buying a 
camcorder and heading out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Burger of Samy's Camera in Los Angeles points out that camcorders using 
the VHS format are the number-one sellers. That's no surprise, considering VHS 
is the most popular format for home videocassette players. 
</P>
<P>
But he adds that the popularity of VHS is waning. "VHS' biggest drawback is its 
size and weight," he said. "We ask customers what their use will be." 
</P>
<P>
The most highly recommended camcorders are those that capture the clearest 
image in the lightest and smallest package. But convenience of playback is 
another consideration. A bulkier, less-expensive camcorder is more likely to be 
compatible with the cassette player you already own. 
</P>
<P>
Following are the main tape formats: 
</P>
<P>
 -- VHS and Super VHS. Super offers 66% greater resolution. Both types of 
cassette run for two hours and can be played on most home VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- VHS-C and Super VHS-C. "C" stands for compact. The cassettes are less than 
half the size of VHS but run only 20 minutes. Both adapt easily to play on most 
home VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eight-millimeter and Hi-8. The cassettes are the same size as VHS-C but 
offer two-hour recording and slightly better resolution. They cannot be adapted 
to play on most home VCRs. However, with a simple cable, the 8-millimeter or 
Hi-8 camcorder can be plugged directly into a TV set for playback. (The same 
can be done with VHS and VHS-C camcorders.) 
</P>
<P>
Newer TVs with better resolution are best for Hi-8 play. For either 
8-millimeter or Hi-8 you can buy a special cassette player, but, honestly, 
you're better off saving your money for vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Burger's cut-to-the-basics recommendation:

"For quality, weight and size, buy regular 8 or Hi-8. There are more than 30 
camcorders to choose from, from $699 up to $2,500. Hi-8 is the best bet, with 
new televisions capable of showing more lines of resolution. But if your TV is 
old, put the extra money into accessories." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, accessories . . . 
</P>
<P>
Buyers' foremost concerns reflect the effectiveness of advertising. Auto-focus, 
power zooms with long ranges, high-speed shutters and super-impose capabilities 
are all features that customers demand. 
</P>
<P>
But Burger says some questions reflect more advertising knowledge than 
technical familiarity. "People ask how many 'pixels' a camcorder will have. Or 
they'll ask what is the 'lux' level. What they know is that the higher the 
pixels the better, and the lower the lux the better." 
</P>
<P>
A pixel is a "picture element," the dots that make up the image on the screen. 
Lux is a measure of light intensity under very specific conditions. The more 
pixels, the greater the contrast and definition on the screen, while low lux 
numbers reflect a camera's ability to record an image in low light. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many manufacturers, both Sony and Canon offer a full line of 
8-millimeter camcorders. Both make their own equipment to cover a broad price 
range. And both offer purse-size lightweight cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Sony's TR-5 weighs just under two pounds (all weights are quoted without 
battery or tape). 
</P>
<P>
Canon's equivalent E06 weighs two pounds. Both feature 6-1 zoom lenses, auto 
focus and auto-exposure. But expect a premium price for the miniaturization. 
Sony's TR-5 sells for $999, while Canon's EO6 costs $1,299. 
</P>
<P>
The difference? Canon's has stereo sound recording, a "FlexiGrip" viewfinder 
and a wireless remote controller, enabling the user to put himself in the video 
more creatively. 
</P>
<P>
If you're willing to lug a few more ounces, prices drop. Canon's low-end E51 
sells for $899. But it still has the remote controller, stereo sound and 
FlexiGrip. Sony's version is the F33 at $799. But the Sony zooms out to a wider 
view without accessory lenses. The Sony weighs 2 pounds 10 ounces, the Canon 2 
pounds 7 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-range, both companies' 8-millimeter camcorders get intensely creative with 
features. Sony's F77 (2 pounds 10 ounces; $1,295) has an 8-1 zoom, stereo 
sound, programmable "exposure" ("sports" switches to a higher shutter speed to 
freeze the action crisply, while "portrait" softens background focus to center 
interest on the subject), freeze frames, slo-mo, super-impose functions (which 
allow you to copy a title, put it in memory and then call it up for recording 
when the scene matches the title), a wireless remote control and a 
through-the-lens auto-focus system. 
</P>
<P>
Canon's E808 (2 pounds 11 ounces; $1,449) offers a similar 8-1 zoom, FlexiGrip, 
remote controller, a built-in title-maker and high-speed shutters for sports 
video. Canon's auto focus uses an infra-red system that reacts more quickly and 
is more accurate in very low light. 
</P>
<P>
At the high end, numerous features make virtually anything possible. Sony 
offers the V101 Hi-8 (replacing the V99, which was the first Hi-8 camcorder). 
</P>
<P>
Priced at $1,559, the Sony Hi-8 (2 pounds 10 ounces) produces 410,000 pixels. 
Four auto-exposure modes provide sport and portrait settings, as well as 
shutter or aperture priorities just like sophisticated 35-millimeter cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Canon, not to be outdone, has just introduced a most-unusual-looking Hi-8 
machine, the A1 Mk II. At $1,888, the Canon (3 pounds, 5 ounces) features 10-1 
zoom, seven shutter speeds and all the rest, matching Sony's 410,000 pixels. 
</P>
<P>
But before you head for the airport, be sure to test all your equipment 
thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Charge the batteries (always carry a spare), make a tape, try some titles, 
shoot some sports and some portraits, and shoot in the dark. Then pack extra 
blank tapes. Better to have too many than too few. 
</P>
<P>
Now sling that two-pound-something camcorder over your shoulder, just where the 
snappy 35-millimeter camera used to hang, and start making pictures that move 
and speak.

B&amp;BS IN SAN BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS OFFER ESCAPE FROM SUMMER HEAT

BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blue skies, evergreen forests, azure lakes and a host of bed and breakfast inns 
promise relief from the megalopolis in midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot nicer up here than it is down there," said Janice Hague, who was 
having a leisurely breakfast with her husband Chris on the back porch of the 
Eagle's Nest B&amp;B in this quiet alpine community. 
</P>
<P>
Lounging in their bathrobes, a mile high in the San Bernardino Mountains, the 
couple was escaping the heat and smog that recently covered their San Fernando 
Valley home and much of the Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
Although Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead have long been fresh-air retreats for 
Southlanders, an increasing number of B&amp;Bs now offer a greater variety of 
lodgings and locations. They range from one room in a private house, where a 
continental breakfast is served, to a more traditional inn featuring 10 guest 
rooms and a full breakfast with home recipes. 
</P>
<P>
These days, more than a dozen B&amp;Bs are scattered in the mountains at Lake 
Arrowhead, Skyforest, Blue Jay, Running Springs, Fawnskin, Big Bear City and 
Big Bear Lake. All rates quoted in the following B&amp;Bs are per room or 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
The Hagues were staying just off the main highway in Big Bear Lake at the cozy 
five-room, five-bath Eagle's Nest, owned and operated by Jim Joyce and Jack 
Draper. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening their log cabin lodge three summers ago, the dedicated innkeepers 
have added three private cottage suites in a separate building. 
</P>
<P>
"The suites are for guests who want a more secluded getaway," Joyce said. "They 
are very popular with honeymooners." 
</P>
<P>
Each suite has a wood-burning fireplace, a TV set, mini-refrigerator, microwave 
oven and coffee-maker. Two of the suites feature Jacuzzis, the other a sleeper 
to accommodate children. Nightly rates are $80 weekdays, $130 (with Jacuzzi 
tub) and $110 (with sleeper) on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Guests in the suites cook their own breakfast or go out to eat. "We recommend 
The Landings Cafe in the terminal of the Big Bear City Airport," Draper said. 
</P>
<P>
B&amp;B guests in the main house are served a bountiful breakfast by the 
innkeepers. Weeknight rates are $70, weekends $85/$95. Call (714) 866-6465 for 
reservations at Eagle's Nest. 
</P>
<P>
The best-known B&amp;B at Big Bear Lake is the historic Knickerbocker Mansion, 
named for the man who began building the four-story home of vertical logs in 
the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
After 44 years, Bill Knickerbocker was still working on the imposing structure 
when he died at the age of 89. It became a B&amp;B five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Almost the entire top of the house was recently turned into a honeymoon suite, 
complete with a double-size Jacuzzi and a wood stove. A VCR accompanies a huge 
projection TV screen, and guests in the suite also enjoy an audio system with 
CD and cassette players. The spacious accommodation is $150 per night. 
</P>
<P>
The other five guest rooms in the rather rustic mansion share two baths and 
rent for $85 per night. Four more rooms, all with private bath, were created in 
the hayloft of the adjacent carriage house. Rooms are $95 per night in the 
carriage house, which was the meeting site of Big Bear's first Masonic lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Ask owner Phyliss Knight, who moved from Fullerton to take over the B&amp;B in 
1987, more about the old home's history. 
</P>
<P>
Her assistant, Valerie Prehm, can explain about the bullet lodged in a door 
jamb in the dining room. Another of the innkeepers, JoAnna Derrington, will 
relate her experiences with the resident ghost. 
</P>
<P>
People like the informality of the Knickerbocker Mansion. "We want guests to 
feel like they're visiting grandma's house," Derrington said. In the kitchen, a 
cookie jar is filled with help-yourself treats, and coffee and tea are always 
available. An expanded continental breakfast is offered in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
A hammock beckons lazing visitors to the second-floor porch, where rocking 
chairs also give views through enormous pine trees to the lake. Croquet, 
Ping-Pong, darts and a Jacuzzi on the sun deck are other diversions. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-acre property adjoins a national forest with hiking trails. In the 
opposite direction, it's a three-block walk to the center of town. For 
reservations at the Knickerbocker Mansion, call (714) 866-8221. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposite side of the lake in Big Bear City is Gold Mountain Manor, 
another vintage log house that was restored as a B&amp;B five years ago. Since 
being erected in a pine forest in 1926 as a private club's mansion, the 
three-story structure also has been a bordello and a boarding house. 
</P>
<P>
A Victorville grade school principal, Conny Ridgway, and her husband, John, 
bought the seven-room inn last year and have put it into tiptop shape. 
</P>
<P>
The rooms have fireplaces and individual decors, including the downstairs suite 
with a pioneer-Indian motif that's named for a Big Bear outdoorsman, Ted Ducey. 
It features a private Jacuzzi, a half bath and a nightly tab of $150. The 
presidential suite, which has a full private bath, costs the same. 
</P>
<P>
The Honeymoon Room with half bath is $130. The other four rooms in the manor 
share two baths and cost $110/$115, except the small Wildcat Room, which has no 
fireplace and goes for $75. 
</P>
<P>
Rates include a home-cooked breakfast. Guests like the quiet location and 
woodsy grounds of this historic inn, which has been the background for a number 
of clothing ads and catalogues. Call (714) 585-6997 for a room at Gold Mountain 
Manor. 
</P>
<P>
The much newer Inn at Fawnskin also is on the north side of Big Bear Lake, but 
near its western end. G.B. and Susie Sneed left Orange County and the savings 
and loan industry to open their four-room B&amp;B in a contemporary log home 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We came up here and fell in love with the place," G.B. said. It shows. The 
comfortable, well-kept inn has country decor befitting its knotty pine 
interior, along with special features ranging from a grand piano to a 
basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
A pool table, wide-screen TV with a selection of 200 videotapes and a wet bar 
(bring your own liquor) are found in a separate game room. Novels line 
floor-to-ceiling shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"Families and small groups of friends sometimes rent the entire inn," G.B. 
said. "We're happy to socialize as innkeepers or just retreat to our own cabin 
and leave them alone." 
</P>
<P>
The four upstairs rooms are from $75 for the smallest to $155 for the master 
suite, which has a private bath, rock fireplace, TV and VCR. 
</P>
<P>
For breakfast, stuffed French toast and Susie's cinnamon rolls are favorites of 
the guests. For reservations at the Inn at Fawnskin, call (714) 866-3200. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from Lake Arrowhead, along Rim of the World Drive at Skyforest, is the 
Storybook Inn. This rambling, glass-fronted home was built in the 1940s for the 
man who designed the original Lake Arrowhead Village. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Kathleen and John Wooley of Glendale purchased the three-story inn, 
which has nine large guest rooms and suites, all with private bath. Rates are 
$95/$155, less on weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
A special attraction is a rustic 1930s log cabin that resembles a hunting lodge 
with mounted fish and game trophies, stone fireplace and knotty-pine paneling. 
It sleeps six in two bedrooms and a loft, and there are two baths plus a full 
kitchen. The rent is $175 for two, plus $30 for each extra person. 
</P>
<P>
Guests get a hot tub and sun deck with views of the valley on non-smoggy days. 
In the morning, a hot breakfast is brought to each room with the daily 
newspaper, or guests can eat in the dining room or solarium. For reservations 
at Storybook Inn, call (714) 336-1483. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to Lake Arrowhead is the 6,500-square-foot home of Jody and Oscar Wilson 
that they transformed into the impressive six-room Chateau Du Lac Bed &amp; 
Breakfast Inn in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakeview Suite has the best view of Lake Arrowhead and comes with an 
outdoor balcony, Jacuzzi and fireplace. The tab is $250, including a gourmet 
breakfast and lavish afternoon tea. Jody, who was a caterer in Palos Verdes, 
also can prepare special dinners by request. 
</P>
<P>
All rooms feature queen-size beds, TVs and telephones. Only two rooms share a 
bath, and they are the least expensive at $95 per night. Guests relax in the 
upper-level library or the dining room, where there is a game table. A canary 
serenading visitors in the dining room adds to the charm of this handsome inn. 
For reservations at Chateau Du Lac, call (714) 337-6488. 
</P>
<P>
Also near the water is the first B&amp;B at Lake Arrowhead, the homey Bluebelle 
House that Lila and Rick Peiffer opened in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Bluebelle's five rooms are decorated in motifs recalling the 
innkeepers' travels to Paris, Bavaria and Austria. The others have romance and 
country themes, including silk flower displays that reflect Lila's background 
as a floral and interior designer. 
</P>
<P>
Nightly rates are $75/$110, including a home-cooked breakfast. Call (714) 
336-3292 for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Another B&amp;B at Lake Arrowhead is Eagle's Landing, where four rooms in 
Dorothy and Jack Stone's modern home rent for $85/$155. Call (714) 336-2642. 
</P>
<P>
For other bed and breakfast inns in the area, call the Big Bear Chamber of 
Commerce at (714) 866-4607. Also contact the Lake Arrowhead Communities Chamber 
of Commerce: (714) 337-3715. 
</P>
<P>
Be warned that many B&amp;Bs have prohibitions regarding smoking, children and 
pets. A two-night minimum stay often is required on weekends, with three nights 
over holiday weekends. Ask about midweek and senior citizen discounts. 
</P>
<P>
To reach Big Bear Lake via Lake Arrowhead, drive east from Los Angeles on 
Interstate 10 to join Interstate 215 north. Follow the freeway direction for 
Highland Avenue/Mountain Resorts, California 30, then take the Cresttline/Lake 
Arrowhead exit, Waterman Avenue, which is California 18 and winds up the 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative route is to continue east on California 30 about five miles 
beyond the California 18 exit and join California 330 up the mountain to Big 
Bear Lake via Running Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Big Bear Lake is 210 miles.

TRAIL RUNS DOWNHILL FROM MOUNTAINS TO BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skyline to the Sea Trail, as its name suggests, drops from the crest of the 
Santa Cruz Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, it runs downhill on its scenic 35-mile journey from Castle 
Rock State Park to Big Basin Redwoods State Park to Waddell Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Views from the Skyline -- redwood-forested slopes, fern-smothered canyons and 
the great blue Pacific -- are superb. 
</P>
<P>
This gem of a trail has many friends. During one weekend in 1969, dedicated 
members of the Sempervirens Fund and the Santa Cruz Trails Assn. turned out 
more than 2,000 volunteers to dig, clear, prune and otherwise improve the 
trail. Area volunteers put together an annual Trails Day that is now a model 
for trails organizations throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
A fine backpack for a three-day weekend would be to trek the 35 miles of 
Skyline from Castle Rock State Park to Big Basin, then onward to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Castle Rock, perched on the western ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains, is in 
turn connected by trails to parks and open-space preserves in the Santa Clara 
Valley. With judicious use of a map, a longer backpacking trip could be 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
The wildest and most beautiful part of the Skyline stretches from park 
headquarters at Big Basin to Waddell Creek Beach and Marsh. It winds through 
deep woods and explores the moist environments of Waddell and Berry creeks. 
</P>
<P>
Springtime, when the creeks are frothy torrents and Berry Creek Falls cascades 
at full vigor, is a particularly dramatic time to walk the Skyline to the Sea 
Trail; during summer, the cool world of the redwood canyons is a great place to 
escape the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Big Basin -- California's first state park, set aside in 1902 -- survived last 
October's Santa Cruz earthquake in pretty good shape. Park roads were cracked, 
electric lines went down and pipes ruptured. The park was closed immediately 
after the quake, but was soon reopened. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers believe that few, if any, of the tall redwoods toppled because of the 
quake, though many trees lost heavy branches. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From Santa Cruz, drive 12 miles north on Highway 9. 
Turn west on Highway 236 and proceed nine miles to Big Basin Redwoods State 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
If you're hiking from Big Basin to the sea, you'll need to arrange a car 
shuttle. Waddell Beach, at trail's end, is 18 miles upcoast from Santa Cruz on 
Highway 1. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, take the bus, which stops at both the state park and Waddell Beach. 
One suggestion: Leave your car at the Santa Cruz bus station (920 Pacific Ave.) 
and take the 7:45 a.m. (weekends) bus bound for the state park. You'll arrive 
about 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Hit the trail and take the 5:15 p.m. bus from Waddell Beach back to Santa Cruz. 
Schedules are different on weekends and weekdays and change frequently. Call 
the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District at (408) 425-8600 for the latest 
bus schedule. The $2 daily ride pass is a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: The trail begins in the nucleus of the park on Opal Creek flatlands 
at the bottom of the basin. From park headquarters, join Redwood Trail, which 
crosses a bridge and travels a few hundred yards to a signed junction with 
Skyline to the Sea Trail. You'll turn toward the sea and begin a stiff climb 
out of the basin, passing junctions with other park trails. 
</P>
<P>
After climbing, the trail descends through deep and dark woods, first with 
Kelly Creek, then along the west fork of Waddell Creek. Ferns and mushrooms, 
salamanders and banana slugs occupy the wet world of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
Some four miles from the trailhead, just short of the confluence of Waddell 
Creek and Berry Creek, you'll intersect Berry Creek Falls Trail. The falls 
cascade over fern-covered cliffs into a frothy pool. 
</P>
<P>
An ideal lunch stop, or turnaround spot, is Sunset Trail Camp, located a mile 
up Berry Creek Falls Trail and near another falls -- Golden Falls. 
</P>
<P>
Skyline to the Sea Trail descends with Waddell Creek and passes through the 
heart of the beautiful Waddell Valley. Rancho del Oso, "Ranch of the Bears," as 
this region is known, has second-generation redwoods, Douglas fir and Monterey 
pine, as well as lush meadows. 
</P>
<P>
A mile and a half from the ocean, you'll reach Twin Redwoods Camp. As you near 
the sea, the redwoods give way to laurel groves and meadow land. Near trail's 
end is a freshwater marsh, a favorite stopping place for migratory birds on the 
Pacific flyway. 
</P>
<P>
A wildlife sanctuary, Theodore J. Hoover Natural Preserve, has been established 
in the heart of the marsh area for more than 200 kinds of native and migratory 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
The trail ends at Highway 1. West of the highway is a bus stop and wind-swept 
Waddell Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Maps detailing the Skyline to the Sea Trail are available at park headquarters 
or by mail. 
</P>
<P>
One map covers Castle Rock to Big Basin, another covers Big Basin to the sea. A 
third is a general map of Big Basin Redwoods State Park. The maps, $1 each, are 
available from the Santa Cruz Mountains Natural History Assn., 101 N. Big Trees 
Park Road, Felton, Calif. 95018.

Maria Anderson came all the way from Minneapolis to outfit her daughter's 
wedding at one of Filene's Basement's legendary bridal gown sales. Every price 
tag in a sea of white lace and pastels had been slashed to $199. 
</P>
<P>
Although she and her daughter were weary, they posted trophies: a flowing 
antique white extravaganza (original price: $2,000), a silver-gray gown (from 
$850) and four square-necked, peach-colored bridesmaid's dresses (each reduced 
from $700). 
</P>
<P>
Filene's Basement's bridal sales occur two or three times a year. Sales of 
women's designer-label suits ($150 to $285 reduced to $75) are held twice 
yearly, and sales of men's designer suits ($185 to $235 reduced to $79) are 
held once a year. Discounts of 50% to 70% on casual to formal clothing and some 
home accessories occur every day. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of its items are available in limited sizes or colors and labels 
are often removed, Filene's Basement draws shoppers from around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The granddaddy of New England's off-price stores, Filene's Basement was founded 
by Edward A. Filene, who sold marked-down goods in the basement of his pricey 
department store. 
</P>
<P>
Filene's Basement became a separate business in July, 1988, with its own chain 
of stores. The flagship is still in the basement of Filene's at 426 Washington 
St. Seven other stores are in the Boston environs: Framingham, Burlingon, 
Danvers, Dedham, Saugus, Braintree and Kingston. Still others are elsewhere in 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
Don't believe for a moment that the Andersons' pre-nuptial trek to Filene's 
Basement was unusual, because discount shopping is one of New England's top 
tourist attractions. In addition to Filene's Basement, hundreds of discount 
outlets, selling everything from shoes to top-quality porcelain at 30% to 50% 
off regular retail prices, abound. 
</P>
<P>
Outlets at factories or in nearby stores offer shoppers an opportunity to see 
how goods are made. 
</P>
<P>
The Cheese Outlet, 398 Pine St., Burlington, Vt., is in a huge 120-year-old 
brick building next to a factory that gives mouth-watering tours. Happily, the 
firm sets out samples of Vermont cheddar, gouda, feta and all sorts of imported 
cheeses. In all, the store carries about 100 varieties of cheese at low prices. 
Creamy French brie is only $1.99 per pound. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Steve Lidle says that the Cheese Outlet also sells other 
gourmet goodies. "Three times a year we offer pure Vermont maple syrup for $20 
per gallon, and there's always a selection of about 30 close-out and 
private-label wines for $3.99 each, or two for $7. We ship everything, except 
wines, so shoppers don't have to carry their purchases, including our crustless 
Vermont Velvet cheesecake." 
</P>
<P>
About 50 miles to the north, Johnson Woolen Mills Factory Store, on Main Street 
in Johnson, Vt., punctuates an otherwise rural experience with some high-tech 
weaving and wonderful bargains on hundreds of woolen and natural-fiber 
blankets, sweaters, outerwear, sportswear, mittens and fabrics. These are sold 
at 20% to 40% off list. A seconds and samples section also reduces prices, by 
50% to 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Discounters, offering overruns or second-quality local and imported goods, put 
otherwise obscure towns on the map. In Mount Washington Valley, N.H., the 
stretch of Route 16 near North Conway Village boasts 39 discount outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for home accessories? You'll find Corning/Revere, Dansk, Gorham (china, 
crystal and Norman Rockwell prints at 60% off list) and Alpine Sheets and 
Towels (Fieldcrest and other labels). For clothing: Izod, J. Crew, Jonathan 
Logan, Calvin Klein, Evan Picone, Guess?, Leslie Fay, Liz Claiborne, London 
Fog, Levi Strauss, Timberland, Andrew Marc, Aileen, Anne Klein and others. For 
shoes and accessories: Swank, Converse, LeSportsac, Johnston &amp; Murphy, 
L'Eggs/Hanes, Dexter Shoes, Reebok/Rockport and others. 
</P>
<P>
Some chain store discounters have identical stores in several popular discount 
malls. Anne Klein, Calvin Klein, Harve Bernard, Dansk, American Tourister and 
Villeroy &amp; Boch are frequently featured. 
</P>
<P>
For out-of-towners, discount malls are best bets for variety of merchandise. 
Connecticut's two examples of the well-groomed New England mall are easily 
accessible from New York City by car or public transportation: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Milford Factory Outlet Center, 321 Post Road, Milford. Its super shops 
include Harve Bernard (men's shirts for $30 and slacks for $39 to $79, silk 
ties for $12 and women's gaberdine coat dresses for $200 and suits for $149 to 
$220, silk scarves for $20, Van Heusen (men's shirts for $12 to $40 and silk 
ties for $7 to $20, women's jeans for $19 to $25 and sweaters for $33, all with 
the Van Heusen label), Micki's Designer Separates (washable silks for $40 to 
$75 each), Leather Loft (briefcases by Carlo Anabaldi from $70 and Renwick for

firsts at $150 per setting, and figurines from $99 to $500 or about 20% off 
retail), Villeroy &amp; Boch (open stock on bone china seconds are at least 35% 
off list), plus Harve Bernard, Van Heusen, Micki's Designer Separates (each 
with the same merchandise and prices as at Milford), and more. 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts' biggest concentration of discount shops is in Bristol County at 
Fall River and New Bedford, actually closer to Providence and Newport, R.I., 
than to Boston. The area has more than 90 factory-direct and off-price outlets, 
including Hickey Freeman, Alexander Julian, Oleg Cassini, Vakko Leather &amp; 
Suede, Fenn Wright &amp; Manson, WilliWear, Gitano, Carlos Falchi and others, 
at 50% to 75% off list. 
</P>
<P>
In Freeport, Me., the L. L. Bean Factory Store on Main Street, offering 
discounts on discontinued catalogue merchandise, has been surrounded by dozens 
of other factory outlets, including those of Laura Ashley, Jones New York, 
Patagonia, Bass Shoes, Cole-Haan, Coach Leather, Mikasa and others, offering 
30% to 50% off list.

LAPP MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I happened to catch the Times Shopper article on Sami crafts by Jennifer Merin 
in the June 24 Travel Section. 
</P>
<P>
By fortuitous coincidence, I discovered a Lapp (Sami) movie at the Laemmle Fine 
Arts Theatre: "Pathfinder." The movie recounts a 1,000-year-old Lapp legend of 
a young boy who saves his people from murderous invaders and features Lapp 
actors speaking the Lapp language. It's a fascinating view of another time and 
culture. Anyone who found your article on the Sami traditional techniques in 
craft-making interesting would enjoy "Pathfinder" as well.

NO HELP AT EMBASSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Referring to the story on embassy help by Richard Gilbert in the June 17 Travel 
Section ("Abroad and In Trouble? An Embassy Can Help"), I dare say he didn't 
ever work at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, and two days before leaving Paris for home, my purse with all 
our travel documents was ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
We went immediately to the embassy and were met by two men with deep accents 
who advised us to report to the local gendarmerie. We did, with much 
language-barrier difficulty. Then the two men said the embassy only deals with 
French-American problems and we would have to go to the consulate (which was 
closed for the weekend). We had to wait until Monday for any aid. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately we were with friends who helped tide us over. At the consulate, we 
had to buy new passports with cash only (no traveler's checks, no credit cards) 
and new pictures, and we also had to wait a full day, almost missing our flight 
home. The consulate people weren't very pleasant about it either. They behaved 
as though we had committed a sin. 
</P>
<P>
While we sat waiting all day at the consulate, we watched how some of our 
citizens were treated by the French employees of our consulate. Students that 
had been robbed of everything were not even allowed to make collect calls home 
for a full 24 hours to get funds. They were advised to apply to some charitable 
agency for help in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
What possible excuse is there for treating our own citizens in such a cavalier 
fashion? Is this the government we support with our taxes? Thanks for letting 
me unload a lot of long dormant anger.

VICTORIA'S 'BEST' PUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We enjoyed the article by Travel Editor Jerry Hulse, "Victoria, B.C. -- 
Everything But the Queen" (June 17), but believe he missed the best pub there. 
According to our experience (considering spirits, food and atmosphere) and 
recommended by the locals, the pub is Spinnakers, which is located just west of 
downtown over the Johnson Street Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
At 308 Catherine St., the pub has a view of the harbor from its windows or 
outside tables. It is not a tourist hangout. The food is exceptional, the beer 
made in the on-site micro-brewery is excellent, and the place, as large as it 
is, is always crowded. Prices are set for the local market. It is not a 
conventional pub with a long bar and side benches, but a sort of 
grab-your-own-seats-at-sitdown-tables kind of place. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Hulse's article only mentioned access to Victoria from Vancouver. For 
many, easy entry is provided via Seattle and two year-round ferry lines. One 
offers a three-hour trip on the Victoria Clipper, and the other is four hours 
on the Vancouver Island Princess or Princess Marguerite. You also can get to 
Victoria from Port Angeles on the Olympic Peninsula, by sea ferry or from north 
of Seattle on state of Washington ferries.

SIGNS OF CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reading the article "Lack of Hospitality," by Arnold Stone (June 24), reminded 
me of our drive last July from Vancouver, B.C., through Washington, Oregon and 
into California. 
</P>
<P>
There were many helpful directions and signs for tourists all through 
Washington and Oregon, but the moment we crossed the border into California, 
the first sign we saw was "$500 Fine for Littering." Very few directional signs 
were evident along the California coast. Winding through the hills near Bodega 
Bay, we were strictly on our own, fervently hoping that we were heading for San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
No welcome station at the California border is necessary, but more hospitality 
and signs would be appreciated.

MEXICO'S HUMAN-RIGHTS IMAGE TAKING A BEATING; 
</P>
<P>
REFORM: PRESIDENT SALINAS' ECONOMIC PROGRESS HAS NOT BEEN MATCHED BY A MORE 
OPEN POLITICAL SYSTEM -- AND THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jorge G. Castaneda, Jorge G. Castaneda is a graduate professor of political 
science at the National University of Mexico.

<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Growing human-rights violations in Mexico have begun to alter foreign 
perceptions of the country and its political system. The abuses have touched 
many sectors of society. Observers and analysts of Mexican society -- including 
this writer -- have suddenly become unwilling participants in Mexican politics. 
</P>
<P>
The highly favorable foreign view of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari rested 
on a credible -- yet false -- premise. His administration, it was believed, had 
undertaken a bold economic modernization program that, unfortunately, had not 
yet been matched by a similar drive to reform the country's political system. 
In time, though, politics would open up. 
</P>
<P>
Explanations in the foreign press for this unevenness varied. Some articles 
attributed it to the inertia common to an authoritarian system undergoing 
change. Others cited resistance within the ruling Partido Revolucionario 
Institucional. Still others blamed Salinas' ambition and thirst for power. But 
whatever the reason for the political-economic imbalance, the consensus abroad 
was that it would be worked out with time. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the foreign applause for the Mexican administration's economic 
policies was partly blind. If Salinas' program were generating the expected 
results -- price stability, economic growth, greater competitiveness reflected 
in rising exports -- it should produce the liberalizing effects that successful 
economic policies bring. Thus the enigma: If, thanks to a widely praised 
economic program, the economic and social welfare of most Mexicans is 
improving, there is no reason to keep on fearing democracy. If the economy is 
working, why not open up the political system and win across-the-board? Why is 
Salinas stubbornly unwilling to carry out true political reform and banish, 
once and for all, electoral fraud from Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
Because the economy has not been performing the way it was expected, and thus 
the awaited political effects have not materialized. Any political opening 
would pave the way for an electoral debacle for the ruling party. Therefore, 
there is no true democratization in sight. 
</P>
<P>
The big problem with Salinas' economic program is that its main justification 
lies more in the failure of previous policies than in its merits. The program 
requires huge amounts of external resources that are simply unavailable, a type 
of entrepreneurial elite that Mexico has never had and something that the 
Mexican president does not have -- time. In the long run, his conservative 
economic program may work; in the short and medium terms, it doesn't look like 
it will. 
</P>
<P>
Not that all is gloom and doom. There is no economic crisis on the horizon. 
Indeed, the Salinas term is looking more and more like an improved version of 
his predecessor's. Instead of the net zero economic growth during the 
administration of Miguel de la Madrid, the economy is expanding at a rate of 2% 
to 2.5%, roughly the equivalent of population growth. The Mexican economy can 
pay its foreign bills, but only keep pace with population increases. Or if it 
receives a much greater infusion of foreign funding to meet its debt service 
and trade gap, the economy can grow faster than the population. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, economic growth barely surpassed that of population growth. This year, 
it will probably fall behind -- not because of error or accident but because of 
a deliberate cooling of the economy by the Salinas administration. It lacks the 
hard currency to finance a higher rate of expansion. The foreign trade figures 
for the first four months of this year were ominous: The trade deficit reached 
$874 million. At that rate, the yearly gap would be nearly $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Meager economic growth and pressures to open up the political system have led 
to an atmosphere of domestic tension and external one-upmanship. The tension at 
home stems from continuing electoral fraud: In every vote, the PRI and the 
government, at all levels, do everything they can to win. They concede defeat 
only when faced with absolutely no alternative. The consequences: attrition, 
disenchantment and discredit not only for the government but also for the 
opposition, particularly the center-left. 
</P>
<P>
The external one-upmanship is equally apparent. As the economy slows down and 
the influx of foreign funds tapers off, the Salinas administration feels forced 
to make greater concessions to and advances toward its chief benefactor -- the 
United States. It proposes a free-trade agreement without weighing the 
consequences of using strategic economic policy instruments to solve short-term 
cash-flow problems. It pursues increasingly radical, supply-side economic 
policies that shift the government farther and farther from the political 
center. It launches an ill-conceived but much-vaunted war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Tragically, anti-drug cooperation is one of the factors leading to the 
deteriorating human-rights situation in Mexico. As U.S. cooperation in 
obtaining funding becomes more and more decisive, Mexican cooperation in the 
war on drugs becomes ever more necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In its terrifying report on human rights in Mexico for 1989-90, Americas Watch 
stated: "Disappearances, murder, torture and other violent abuses of human 
rights by the security forces have become institutionalized in Mexico . . . 
This pattern of excessive violence and abuses can only mean either that the 
Mexican government has adopted a policy that consists in tolerating this 
behavior, or that it has lost control over its security and law enforcement 
agencies." 
</P>
<P>
This is the result of cooperation with the United States at all costs: the 
emergence of security forces that are out of control because of demands made on 
them that they cannot fulfill. The Mexican judicial police -- corrupt, violent 
and dramatically poorly trained -- cannot be transformed overnight into Elliott 
Ness' "Untouchables." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the radicalization of the government's program or the Salinas 
administration's extremism has left a vacuum at the center of the political 
spectrum. Many sectors of the opposition and many independent intellectuals 
have begun to build an alternative to the government's program. 
</P>
<P>
This alternative rests on three premises. The first is the true democratization 
of Mexico in electoral matters and beyond -- in labor unions, political parties 
and associations and, perhaps most of all, in the nation's perversely 
controlled mass media. 
</P>
<P>
The second is economic in nature. It involves a broad sum of nuances that, 
collectively, amount to a substantively different program. The point is not to 
close the Mexican economy again. Rather, it is, as former Finance Minister 
Jesus Silva Herzog has said, to open it less, more slowly, more selectively. 
Nor is the point to suspend payments on Mexico's still overwhelming foreign 
debt. Rather, it is to negotiate less hurriedly and with other debtors. And no 
one wants to conserve an oversized state sector within the economy. But 
privatization because of ideological reasons or external pressure is not a 
sensible policy, either. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Mexico's dramatic social crisis. Mexican society is only now 
beginning to grasp the magnitude of the extraordinary "social debt" contracted 
during the De la Madrid years. With children dying of measles on the streets of 
Mexico City because of lack of vaccine, with real spending on education nearly 
halved in a country where half the population is under age 18, the extent of 
the disaster that Salinas inherited becomes evident. Even today, more than 60% 
of the federal budget is devoted to servicing the domestic and foreign debt. 
Net social spending on the poor is barely being maintained. This is why the 
third leg of an alternative to Salinas' program is social: It implies finding a 
remedy and putting an end to this shameful state of affairs. 
</P>
<P>
A more balanced foreign view of Mexico will be better for Mexico. Closing one's 
eyes to Mexico's problems or prematurely celebrating fleeting or incomplete 
achievement helps no one. Entering the world means peering out over the horizon 
and being scrutinized from abroad. It's the price of fame and fortune.

<P>
BRITAIN: DESPITE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION, AMERICA'S LONGTIME SPECIAL 
RELATIONSHIP WITH LONDON SHOULD NOT BE ABANDONED.

By Joel Kotkin, Joel Kotkin, co-author of Third Century: America's Resurgence 
in the Asian Era (Ivy), is a fellow at the Pepperdine University School of 
Business and Management and at the Center for the New West. He recently 
returned from Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
By accusing Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl of masterminding a German "racket" 
to take over Europe and then comparing him to Adolf Hitler, British Minister of 
Trade and Industry Nicholas Ridley -- who resigned under fire last Saturday -- 
neatly fits the stereotype of the narrow-minded, xenophobic Englishman. However 
appropriate to Ridley himself, this assessment trivializes the true nature of 
British concerns over the impending unification of Europe and its long-term 
meaning for North America. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of their European counterparts, the bulk of British businessmen and 
the ruling Conservatives, including Ridley, strongly favor some form of 
European union, and a broader alliance with Eastern Europe and non-European 
Economic Community member states. Their problems focus not so much on the 
principle of integration but on the future relationship of Europe with the rest 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in the British business class want a united Europe, but they want 
to keep the global market open," said one London executive, who is close to 
leading Conservative circles. "The French and Germans have their first interest 
always in Europe. There's a huge gap in the emphasis between us and them." 
</P>
<P>
Viewed from this perspective, the British, far from conforming to their insular 
image, actually stand, along with the Dutch, as the strongest advocates of a 
cosmopolitan and open Europe -- closely tied to trading partners in North 
America, Asia and other regions of the world. This globalist view conflicts 
strongly with those on the Continent, where a united Europe means a challenge 
to the long-entrenched economic power of North America and of Japan and the 
Pacific Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Americans and others around the world have been slow to focus on this latest 
permutation of Euronationalism and its potential threat to the U.S. position in 
the world. Already, Italy's Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis and French 
President Francois Mitterrand's adviser, Jacques Attali, see in the rise of the 
"new Europe" a harbinger of U.S. decline in international science. 
</P>
<P>
Having dismissed the supposedly declining United States, the Euronationalists 
primarily see the European Community as a means to resist further economic 
advances by the Asian-Pacific Countries. Attali, recently named director for 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, envisions the new united 
Europe emerging along with Japan as one of the two "cores" of the advanced 
industrial world. France's willingness to ally with its historic German enemy 
-- a posture that Ridley compared to that of subservient "poodles" -- stems 
from a deep-seeded fear of Japan. "They have an appetite for revenge, they have 
a desire to conquer the world," claimed Edith Cresson, France's Minister for 
European Affairs. "They buy the Rockefeller Center, things that are 
significant." 
</P>
<P>
To the British, such a vision of Europe threatens not only their long-standing 
ties to the United States but their basic economic interests. Although Britain, 
like other major European countries, now does a majority of its product trade 
on the Continent, its economy is far more dependent on investments, financial 
flows and technological links with non-European partners. In a European 
superstate cut off from the global economy, many fear Britain would become a 
second-rate power compared with France or Italy, not to mention Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Our links to the world are our last power base. If we didn't have our 
connections with the Americans and others we'd become a minor state, a state on 
the fringe of Europe," said Sue Birney, professor at the Canfield School of 
Management near London and an expert on the dynamics of the British economy. 
"It's what we are . . . . It's our history, it's our skill." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is this more true than in London, the European financial capital that 
remains the core of Britain's last claim to worldwide prominence. As a center 
for stocks, financial consulting, accounting and other services, the financial 
center dominates Europe, with a volume of outstanding loans three times those 
of France and almost six times those of its German rivals. Only Tokyo comes 
close as an international source of debt capital. 
</P>
<P>
London's pre-eminence is based not on the strength of the British or even 
European economy, but on its critical links to other critical money centers. 
Japanese, U.S. and other non-EC banks, for example, account for roughly 
two-thirds of the international loans made from London, while other EC 
countries account for a mere 15%. 
</P>
<P>
The globalism of British financial circles, traditionally a critical pillar of 
the Conservative Party, also shows in their investment patterns. In contrast to 
those on the Continent who see a European resurgence set against a backdrop of 
a declining American and a growing Asian threat, British capitalists continue 
to hedge their bets, keeping their largest investments in regions outside of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1980s, British firms solidified their position as the 
pre-eminent investors in the United States, with 1988 flow levels running 
nearly twice the level for the entire European Community. British interests 
also remain closely tied to more far-flung regions such as Africa and Asia. In 
Hong Kong, the estimated book value of British-controlled holdings is estimated 
to be as high as $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Britain also began depending on non-EC investment. Last year, 
Britain attracted at least 38 U.S. projects, the most in Europe and more than 
twice the number for West Germany or France. They also received nearly half 
Japan's roughly $12 billion direct investment in the European Community, more 
than six times that in Germany or France. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly critical has been investment in Britain's long-deteriorating 
industrial sector. Largely incapable of competing with West German and other 
continental powers in such fields as electronics and automobiles, Britain has 
turned to the United States and Japan for expertise and industrial investment. 
</P>
<P>
In Scotland's high-tech "Silicon Glen," U.S. firms now account for roughly 
four-fifths of manufacturing. Similarly, British-made Japanese Hondas, Nissans 
and Toyotas -- mostly from sparkling new plants -- along with locally made 
Fords and Vauxhalls (General Motors) increasingly dominate British roads. 
</P>
<P>
As in financial services, such linkages create British political attitudes in 
conflict with both their major continental counterparts and neo-mercantilist 
European bureaucrats in Brussels. Britain has been feuding bitterly, for 
example, with the European Commission's plans to limit Japanese cars made in 
Britain with 80% European components as "imports." That move could essentially 
throttle any resurgence in this once vibrant British industry because the cars 
would be counted within quotas for Japanese imports. 
</P>
<P>
Given these realities, Britain is likely to emerge in the coming decade as the 
strongest advocate within Europe of a political economy friendly toward the 
United States, as well as the Pacific nations. Today, fashion calls for the 
United States to abandon its long-standing "special relationship" with Britain 
for the embrace of Germany and other continental European states. A more 
prudent course would be to remain close to Britain -- a nation whose economic 
realities, as well as historical ties, make them our most reliable ally on a 
potentially hostile continent.

WILLIAM WHYTE; 
</P>
<P>
ENSURING THAT CITIES GIVE PEOPLE A 'PLACE FOR DREAMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Simon, Scott Simon is host and chief correspondent of National Public 
Radio's Saturday news show, Weekend Edition. He interviewed Whyte at the 
sociologist's office in Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William H. Whyte enjoys stories in which the accidents of fortune win out over 
the deliberation of planning. He recalls the time when the buildings of an 
industrial office park were finished and inhabited before connecting sidewalks 
could be laid. "Wait," he recollects the architect saying. "Hold back a few 
months and see where people walk. That's where you put the sidewalks." 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 76, Whyte is an elder statesman of urban design who still 
cultivates the outlook of a rebel. "Street Corner Society," first published in 
1943, is still widely read in college sociology courses. Whyte was one of the 
first American thinkers to suggest that the modern American city was not some 
monument to be plotted, paved and puffed up to expectations, but was something 
that had already taken shape -- out of a gorgeous conglomeration of different 
peoples, passions and dreams. "What the city has to do -- still more important 
than ever, I think -- is to give people a place for dreams." 
</P>
<P>
He was born in Springfield, Mass., and educated at Swarthmore, Harvard and the 
University of Chicago, where he became a professor of sociology. Some of his 
more than 14 books appear to be technical tomes -- "Human Relations in the 
Restaurant Industry" (1948), or "Higher Yielding Human Systems for Agriculture" 
(1984) -- that attracted a reputation outside their industries and disciplines 
because of Whyte's wit and insights. The largest part of his academic career 
was spent at Cornell, where he taught industrial relations, applied 
anthropology and social science. 
</P>
<P>
"City: Rediscovering the Center" (1989), out in paperback, represents the 
conclusions he and 10 years of students developed by observing the way people 
conduct themselves on the streets of Manhattan. The sociology is footnoted; but 
Whyte's enthusiasm and affection for urban peoples is what stands out. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Whyte commutes daily to his mid-town Manhattan office, overlooking 
Central Park. It is not the post-card view; water-towers, scarred gravel roofs, 
alleys and fire-escapes fill most of his window, but you sense these features 
captivate Whyte more than the rolling green plain of the park that lends a 
sense of peace to the city. "I like to see the guts of a city working," says 
Whyte with a gesture to the view. He offers visitors a cup of coffee, then sets 
out on a 15-minute voyage that involves rinsing, heating, brewing, pouring and 
maneuvering through hallways and storerooms in his office building, to return 
with a single, graciously presented cup. "Dr. Whyte," says a secretary in an 
office across the hall, "loves going off on one of his adventures." 
</P>
<P>
Question: You say that there seems to be a holy war going on against the 
streets in our major cities, and the miscreants are not necessarily muggers and 
scoundrels, but often urban planners. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Exactly, exactly. They are doing all sorts of things for the streets -- 
except strengthening them. They are putting the streets up in sky-bridges. They 
are putting streets in underground concourses. What they are not doing is 
strengthening the good, old streets as we know them. The street, I figure, is 
the river of life of the city. You stick it underground, you put it up in the 
air, and you have diluted your constituency. It deadens the city. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Doesn't that come in response to the fact that urban planners and architects 
and retailers and hotel owners concluded that people were frightened by a lot 
of what was going on in the streets? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. A man put it very well to me. I had been jumping on him, saying, "Why 
are you pushing these off-street streets, and also the megastructures," and he 
said, "OK, they are somewhat anti-urban. But we will never lure people, middle 
class, back to the city unless we offer them security from the city." That's 
the reason for these huge megastructures that look like fortresses . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Like in Detroit, the Renaissance Center . . . for example, they have that great 
big berm -- sort of a long hill -- which actually contains their air 
conditioning. It is part of what is meant to be an invitation to come in and be 
safe from Detroit. I think that some of us have thought, "That's a hell of a 
way to sell the center of the city." It's defensive, it's apologetic. Heavens, 
the way you get people back into the town is to say, "Hey! We have something 
here that you will like." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why does it seem that so much of what has been designed to revitalize the 
city has not worked, and rather more of what just naturally fell into place 
seems to survive? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think that some of the things were sort of doomed. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, planners go on these pilgrimages. They say, "Let's look at some 
of the other cities which have done well, we can get some ideas." So, they go 
to Minneapolis, and they see it's a successful downtown and they see these 
skybreakers. And they go to Montreal, and there are these wonderful subways and 
underground concourses, in both Toronto and Montreal. So they go back home with 
visions and plans for underground concourses and overhead walkways. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I don't blame people in Minneapolis and Montreal for wanting to be a 
little warm in terribly cold weather. But then you get to a place like Dallas, 
with all that warm weather -- they've built the most complete network of 
underground walkways and sky-bridges. They boast you can go from one building 
in Dallas to any other building without ever having to go up on the street. And 
the question I would throw out is: Why? Why do they go to all this trouble to 
take people off the streets? 
</P>
<P>
Q: Reading between the lines of much of what you have written in recent years 
suggests to me that two of the principal motivations in urban planning over the 
past generation have been fear and greed. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, that is true. And of the two, I don't mind greed so much, because that 
can impel a lot of merchants to do a better job of merchandising, but I think 
that the fear is itself an aggrandizing factor. For instance, it is a very 
unhappy sight when you go in and see spikes in public places, like in the 
Peachtree Plaza, Atlanta -- spikes. And you ask them, "Why this?" And they say, 
"Oh, so bums won't spend the night." Well, suppose a bum did spend the night. 
So what? 
</P>
<P>
So I think one of the big negative factors in downtowns today is the fear, the 
almost obsessive fear, that if you fix up a place to attract people, you will 
attract undesirables, ergo, don't fix it up. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You have set up cameras on the streets of New York to observe how people 
behave. Let me ask you about a few of your discoveries. For example, people 
don't walk where there is space to walk; they walk where people are already 
walking. 
</P>
<P>
A: The 100% conversation, I call it. If what we found out is true, then an 
awful lot of the principles of city planning as now practiced are wrong. When I 
started this, in 1970, the big cry then was: Let's reduce this terrible 
congestion that is throttling the city. And you had a lot of documentaries 
then, which, again, were almost neurotic on the subject. Their favorite scene 
was shot from the telephoto lens, and so you see this tremendous compression, 
all these poor people jammed together -- 
</P>
<P>
Q: -- cattle being herded is the impression. 
</P>
<P>
A: Exactly. You know it's just all wrong. I'm not saying that everybody's 
deliriously happy on the streets of New York, but I took sensational, 
authentic, undoctored film of people on the streets of New York smiling . . . . 
</P>
<P>
We were testing hypotheses on-camera, most of which blew up in my face. One of 
my hypotheses was when people meet on the street and say, "Hi, how are you 
doing?" "Long time no see," and that sort of thing, they would move into that 
foot of space along a building front. Quite the opposite. With very good 
exceptions they move into the center of traffic, what I call the 100% location 
-- which is what real-estate people call the busiest street corner. It's 
crowded, but it's also the place of maximum choice. They don't get off in a 
corner somewhere; they don't let themselves get trapped. 
</P>
<P>
That was a most valuable finding, because of the tendency, the thrust, of so 
much pedestrian planning, downtown planning, is let's be more spacious, let's 
give more room, don't cram them in. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about some other findings your film seemed to reveal, that people are 
not the slobs they have been blamed for being. 
</P>
<P>
A: No, they are not. Our film showed people carrying trash around with no place 
to put it. They couldn't see anywhere to throw it away. The minute a trash 
container gets filled, that's when you get the slob. What is he to do? He puts 
the trash in on the top of the thing and it blows away. 
</P>
<P>
Let me tell you about a pet peeve I have: Stairs are unnecessarily steep. Of 
course, they have to be steep enough so that the flight can be contained in the 
lateral space. But, for example, take the 27 steps from the Lexington Avenue 
subway stop to Grand Central -- 27 uninterrupted steps. It is really a job 
getting up these things. And unnecessarily steep, because at the top you have 
got all the room in the world. They could have used that space to make fewer 
steps. You see this kind of thing all over. They don't use the space for where 
people actually walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There seem to be a lot of blank walls in cities. 
</P>
<P>
A: You know, I used to take a lot of pictures of blank walls because they are 
very photogenic. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's that on your office wall? 
</P>
<P>
A: That is my favorite. AT&amp;T's Longline Division headquarters in Manhattan. 
It is about 50 stories high. 
</P>
<P>
Q: And the small sign at the bottom saying -- 
</P>
<P>
A: "No ball or frisbie playing." I love it. But the walls, they really shut 
people out. 
</P>
<P>
Q: No signs of life visible? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. And once you put up a blank wall, it is self-proving. Building owners 
and/or developers can think of all sorts of excuses, for the heating, for the 
air conditioning, but it is justification for a blank wall, to dullify 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Q: They did put a window in John Portman's Los Angeles Bonaventure Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
A: They were finally driven to it because of tremendous criticism from types 
like myself. You bring up the subject of Bonaventure, any of his (Portman's) 
stuff, and everybody says, "I was just in a conference there, I couldn't find 
my way." All these horror tales. You go inside this thing, and they have got 
the Cocktail Plaza, they have got water walls, and you don't know where is 
north, where is south, and it is all sort of circular. Very confusing. And I 
think it is ironic that only about 30 miles away, down in Anaheim, people pay 
good money to walk along a replica of an old-fashioned street in Disneyland. 
See, the market is saying something. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let me see if I can get you to be a bit indiscreet. What North American 
cities do you most enjoy walking around? 
</P>
<P>
A: The pedestrian cities, which, generally speaking, are pedestrian for a 
number of reasons, but one is the ancient street pattern. Boston is a 
delightful place really to walk around. And yet you could argue that the really 
old parts look very perverse, very twisty and so forth, but it is a wonderful 
example of pedestrian scale. OK, what other ones? Well, I am hopelessly 
provincial -- I like New York. It is a great pedestrian town. Philadelphia, 
also. They tend to be 18th Century cities. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there's Seattle. And Portland -- a city that is really coming around. I 
think that the thing that runs though, and you can see my bias, is that they 
look like cities. They don't look like the suburban thing. San Francisco, of 
course -- everybody's favorite city. And Chicago, Toronto, Montreal. These are 
ones -- they tend to be a little on the big side, except for Portland, so they 
have a strong identity. Everybody jumps on Chicago and says it is gritty. Well, 
that is one of the reasons it is great. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some of those North American cities you least enjoy walking 
around? 
</P>
<P>
A: I hate to name any particular. Most middle-western smaller cities, I think, 
have thrown away some of their great attributes. They seem unusually vulnerable 
to the siren song of a suburbanized downtown. With a lot of them, it is too 
late, although I've been to Dayton (Ohio) and they are doing wonderful things. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Where does the 20th-Century city, Los Angeles, fit? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, Los Angeles is very difficult to place. It is a very urban place, make 
no mistake. I mean, everybody says so many suburbs in search of a city, but it 
is an urban place. They have a downtown that is beginning to take shape again. 
I think Los Angeles is a very dynamic city, very exciting, fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
They are trying to work their way to a strong center. There is a downtown, but 
it doesn't fit any category of the others. For instance, Broadway -- it is 
mostly Mexican, a damn lively place, it really is. I mean, you want to see 
street life, boy oh boy, Broadway on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You have been writing about and walking about the streets of the city for 50 
years now. How are North American cities different today from what you might 
have imagined 50 years ago? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think they are better. They really are. It is interesting that the most 
interesting part of the city is downtown. It is not the mall, because as people 
say, one mall looks just like another. They are really amazingly identical -- 
1,000 feet from anchor to anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Would you have guessed, 50 years ago, that there would be so much concern 
about our cities becoming vacant rather than congested? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That was a big change, a big change. But you know, these things people say 
stem from a philosophic base that cities are basically bad places and we have 
got to protect ourselves from the city. That battle is now over, and I think 
sort of ideologically won. 
</P>
<P>
Q: That lesson notwithstanding, how much progress can be made until Americans 
feel that they are not only safe in the middle of the city, but that they can 
send their youngsters to school there, or hold a job in that area? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, this is the big problem. We certainly don't see any solution how. 
</P>
<P>
You know, it is interesting about crime. As far as downtowns go, downtown is 
about the safest place there is in America. Really. I went to a conference of 
police chiefs, and got the computer printout of all the reported crimes in 
Dallas. And, hell's bells, I mean, it is in the suburbs, the suburban mall. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I don't want to say too much bad about the suburban malls, because they 
obviously fulfill a purpose. But the parking lot of a suburban shopping mall is 
a very dangerous place. Something in the layout -- they are scary places. If 
you park way out there, and then if, by the time you take your car most of the 
intervening cars have since left, it is spooky. 
</P>
<P>
So what you are talking about -- crime and homelessness -- is part of a huge 
social problem. And that is just as much a problem, it seems to me, for the 
suburban shopping malls as anywhere else.

ABORTION THE CLASH OF ABSOLUTES; 
</P>
<P>
BOOK MARK: POSITIONING IN THE FIGHT OVER ABORTION LEAVES NO ROOM FOR 
COMPROMISE. THE INTENSITY THAT SEARS BOTH EXTREMES PREVENTS EACH FROM 
ACKNOWLEDGING THERE MIGHT BE POINTS OF AGREEMENT. IN "ABORTION: THE CLASH OF 
ABSOLUTES," LAURENCE TRIBE EXPLAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Laurence H. Tribe, Laurence H. Tribe's most recent book is Abortion: The 
Clash of Absolutes (Norton), from which this is excerpted. He is the Tyler 
Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard University.

Most people are torn by the abortion question. There is something deeply 
misleading about discussing the abortion debate solely in terms of a clash 
between pro-life "groups" and pro-choice "groups," as though each of us could 
properly be labeled as belonging to one camp or the other. For nearly everyone, 
the deepest truth is that the clash is internal. Few people who really permit 
themselves to feel all of what is at stake in the abortion issue can avoid a 
profound sense of internal division. Whatever someone's "bottom line" -- 
whether it is that the choice must belong to the woman or that she must be 
prevented from killing the fetus -- it is hard not to feel deeply the tug of 
the opposing view. 
</P>
<P>
A story told in a recent newspaper interview by Dr. Warren Hern, director of 
the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Colorado, demonstrates this. Hern recounts 
calling one of his closest friends, a "strongly pro-choice" physician who had 
"done abortions himself." When Hern told his friend that he was at work at his 
office, his friend asked, "Still killing babies this late in the afternoon?" 
Hern recalls: "It was like a knife in my gut . . . it really upset me. What it 
conveys is that no matter how supportive people may be, there is still a horror 
at what I do." 
</P>
<P>
Something akin to horror must be felt by everyone involved in the question of 
abortion who has not become anesthetized to the reality of what is at stake. 
This feeling may be less intense with abortions performed in the beginning 
stages of pregnancy, when the embryo is a tiny, visually undifferentiated, 
multicelled growth without discernibly human features. But certainly by some 
point in pregnancy, as soon as abortion involves a fetus recognizably human in 
form, or involves a fetus one might imagine feeling pain, few can avoid the 
sense of tragic choice each abortion entails. 
</P>
<P>
The "absolutes" at issue are the fetus' right to life and the woman's right to 
liberty. Neither "absolute" is really that. Whatever right a woman might have 
to choose abortion would be undermined if the fetus could be saved without 
sacrificing the woman's freedom to end her pregnancy. Most would intuitively 
sense the force of any such fetus' claim to life. 
</P>
<P>
The principal case in the abortion battle is named Jane Roe vs. Henry Wade, 
where the Supreme Court said that, except in narrow circumstances, the U.S. 
Constitution does not permit the government to interfere with a woman's right 
to choose abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Roe vs. Wade is many things. It is a legal decision by the Supreme Court; a 
rallying cry for both sides in the abortion debate. But it is also, and was at 
first, an entirely human story, one that has become by now familiar to many, a 
story similar to other stories repeated all over the United States every day. 
</P>
<P>
"Jane Roe" is not a real person's name, but a pseudonym. "Henry Wade" is the 
real name of a Texas official, enforcing the criminal laws of a legislature 
that had decided to protect unborn lives. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the Supreme Court's decision in Roe vs. Wade, "Jane Roe" revealed 
who she was. Her name was Norma McCorvey. She explained that as she walked home 
from work late one summer evening in 1969, 25 years old and unmarried, she 
became the victim of a gang rape. Her anguish grew several weeks later, she 
said, when she learned to her dismay that she was pregnant.

Abortion was illegal -- except to save the woman's life -- in Texas where she 
lived, and she lacked the resources to travel to a place where a legal abortion 
might be obtained. McCorvey had little education, and did not realize the 
attention her case might receive. When her lawyer informed her that the case 
would be presented to the U.S. Supreme Court, McCorvey was dismayed. "My God," 
she said, "all those people are so important. They don't have time to listen to 
some little old Texas girl who got in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
A decade and a half after the court handed down its decision in Roe vs. Wade, 
McCorvey said she had made up the story to hide the fact that she had gotten 
"in trouble" in the more usual way. Many reacted with dismay. How could the 
heroine of the most important abortion-rights case have deceived the advocates 
of such rights? Few asked why she had felt a need to deceive them. In a 
different sort of society, the life she would have faced as an unwed mother 
might not have been nearly so lonely. In such a society she might not have made 
up a story about how she became pregnant. In such a society she might not have 
chosen an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
It seems telling that in Roe vs. Wade both the woman on one side of the 
"versus" (Roe) and the fetus on the other (represented by Wade) are nameless. 
In much of the debate over abortion in our society, one side or the other is 
reduced to ghostly anonymity. Many who can readily envision the concrete 
humanity of a fetus, who hold its picture high and weep, barely see the woman 
who carries it and her human plight. To them, she becomes an all-but-invisible 
abstraction. Many others, who can readily envision the woman and her body, who 
cry out for her right to control her destiny, barely envision the fetus within 
that woman and do not imagine as real the life it might have been allowed to 
lead. For them, the life of the fetus becomes an equally invisible abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows the names of the countless women who have died from painful and 
illegal abortions? What of the names of the countless babies who would have 
been born but for all the abortions, legal as well as illegal, that have been 
performed in recent decades? Melissa Able would have been aborted if Sandra 
Race Cano, the "Mary Doe" in the case of Doe vs. Bolton, another abortion case 
decided by the Supreme Court on the same day as Roe vs. Wade, had been able to 
obtain in Georgia the abortion she sought there. Because abortion was so 
heavily restricted, Cano ended up giving birth to a daughter -- Able -- whom 
she put up for adoption. Biological mother and daughter have since met; indeed, 
for several months they even lived in the same house. Remarkably, Cano and Able 
are now playing out on a personal level the clash of absolutes with which so 
many of us are familiar. 
</P>
<P>
Although she was once a key pro-choice litigant, Cano believes today that 
abortion should be illegal. She is now active in the pro-life movement. Her 
daughter Able -- herself now a mother -- disagrees. Able knows she would never 
have been born if abortion rights had been established sooner, but she said, in 
November, 1989, that she believes women have the right to choose. Cano, Able 
and McCorvey are three real individuals. That the names of millions of others 
-- the women, the fetuses not born and the many who were born but unwanted -- 
are not known to us should not make them any the less real. 
</P>
<P>
We must see the reality that "Roe" and "Wade" stand for if we are to move 
beyond the clash of absolutes. Giving voice to the human reality on each side 
of the "versus" -- keeping both the woman and the fetus in focus -- may be the 
only way to avoid the no-win battle that mercilessly pits women against their 
unborn children and leaves us all impoverished losers. 
</P>
<P>
America is at a crossroads. In 1989, the 16-year era of judicial protection of 
legal abortion rights that began with the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe 
vs. Wade, ended with that court's 5-4 decision upholding certain state 
regulations of abortion in the case of Webster vs. Reproductive Health 
Services. A right that, since the time of Watergate and Vietnam, had been kept 
by judges from the rough-and-tumble of local politics is now subject to 
regulation -- and possibly even prohibition -- by our elected representatives. 
A right that many Americans took for granted is now up for grabs. As the 1990s 
dawn, the complexion of politics in America is changing daily, and the shadow 
of the question of abortion rights grows, with widespread significance for our 
society. 
</P>
<P>
The debate is unending. None of its participants ever seems even mildly 
persuaded by the arguments of the other side. As the apparently irresistible 
force of the pro-life movement bears down on the seemingly immovable object of 
abortion rights, local politics may at times be overwhelmed by the kind of 
single-issue campaigning that has already distorted the face of national 
elections. If this happens, the losers will be the democratic process and the 
American people. 
</P>
<P>
The traditions that divide us and the myriad difficulties that plague all 
attempts at compromise in matters touching the absolutes of life and liberty, 
and lying at the crossroads of power and sex, may seem overwhelming. But we 
should not let them obscure the common ground we all can stand on. 
</P>
<P>
If advocates on both sides of the abortion debate would just pause, they would 
recognize at least one shared interest: working toward a world of only wanted 
pregnancies. Better education, the provision of contraception, indeed the 
creation of a society where the burden of raising a child is lighter, are all 
achievable goals lost in the shouting about abortion. For while solving the 
puzzle of the abortion dispute will take a journey of self-discovery, nearly 
all of us agree that we should strive for a society in which every child a 
woman conceives is wanted and every child born has someone to love and nurture 
it.

<P>
I'm shocked by the City Council's lack of foresight in approving the Porter 
Ranch development project. This project epitomizes the kind of rampant and 
ill-conceived development that currently plagues our entire city. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, just the impact of this one massive project on our already 
considerable traffic, air pollution and waste disposal problems has the 
potential of bringing this great city to its knees. Yet the council approves 
this project unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
This vote flies in the face of all reason and the overwhelming majority of 
citizens who oppose it. The repercussions of this vote will be far-reaching and 
costly. It will cost the taxpayers to clean up the mess it brings. It will cost 
the city its reputation as a quality of life world leader and it will cost 
those shortsighted council members at election time their status as 
representatives for having shown the voters that they stand with the developers 
against the interests of Los Angeles and the desires of the citizens.

On July 11, The Times reported that the dutiful, public-spirited citizens of 
Los Angeles reduced their June water consumption by 15%. On the very same day, 
the Los Angeles City Council, obviously relieved that the water shortage crisis 
is now over, voted to allow construction of over 3,000 new residences for 
11,000 new Angelenos in the massive Porter Ranch development. To the citizens 
of Los Angeles I say: I hope you enjoy your brown lawns, suckers!

ROSENFIELD ON ENFORCING AUTO INSURANCE ROLLBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rosenfield's column was on target, but his time frame for change is still too 
tolerant of the insurance pirates. We can't wait one, two, or 20 more years for 
insurance reform. 
</P>
<P>
As drivers in California, we are offered the choice of either lining the 
pockets of these greedy bozos or breaking the law. The "peoples' 
representatives" in Sacramento must move immediately to establish a California 
Non-Profit Insurance Fund so that we don't have to make this choice. Otherwise, 
mass civil disobedience will be our only alternative. 
</P>
<P>
If government requires us to carry auto insurance, government must make it 
affordable and responsive to our needs -- or else we as drivers and consumers 
must refuse to be squeezed between the law and the insurers.

<P>
I am continually astounded that someone who talks as incessantly as Rosenfield 
can display such naivete about his intended subject. 
</P>
<P>
Would he really replace the relatively streamlined insurance industry with a 
government bureaucracy which would be even less efficient? And does he really 
think the people of California are so stupid as to believe it would work to 
their advantage? 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield is right on one point: So far, it's only the lawyers who have 
benefited from the insurance reform effort. I would urge him to turn his 
attention to that sector if he sincerely wants to reduce the cost of insurance, 
since that is where 75% of his premium dollars are going.

Where is the water to come from the Porter Ranch development? Do the City 
Council members think that they like Moses can stand on the rock and strike the 
rock and water will come out of it? This appears to be about the only source 
left if the Southern California development interests are to continue to 
prevail against the increasingly clear constraints of diminished sources of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
And what is the mayor saying about "conservation?" Conservation for what, more 
Porter Ranches?

PERSPECTIVE ON EDUCATION; 
</P>
<P>
'BO BELIEVED' -- IN HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT P. KOPPES, Father Albert P. Koppes, academic vice president of Loyola 
Marymount University, is on sabbatical. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the afternoon of Friday, May 11, I met with Bo Kimble to discuss his role in 
the delicate situation of awarding Hank Gathers' diploma, which would be done 
posthumously. Bo, as usual, was calm and confident that everything would go 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Having settled his responsibilities and the arrangements for the award, talk 
turned to the one-on-one contest, in which eight of the best college basketball 
players who would turn pro compete. He had just been named one of the 
competitors. Where did he think he might finish? His response was 
matter-of-fact: He would be ready; he would do exactly what was necessary to 
win. He would win. His response did not surprise me. 
</P>
<P>
I first met Bo, along with his best friend Hank, about five years ago in my 
office. Basketball Coach Paul Westhead had brought me to be interviewed as the 
last stage of their possible admittance to Loyola Marymount University. They 
were in their second semester at USC. Kimble and Gathers brought first-semester 
transcripts with them and a list of the courses they were taking then, their 
second semester. Both were somewhat confused, obviously hurting and a little 
defensive. They had decided to transfer after their coach at USC was replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Hank, as was his nature, was more evidently emotional and upset. Bo, however, 
was very calm and deliberate, not overly talkative, but willing to answer any 
and all questions. Yes, LMU was his first choice for a transfer. Yes, he wished 
to earn a degree, expected to earn a degree. Yes, he definitely was interested 
in a television and film career. He understood that there would be no more 
physical-education credits. He needed philosophy, theology and basic courses 
before he would be able to take communications classes. No problem. He was 
confident that he could take and pass the courses necessary to receive a 
diploma. He never doubted that he would graduate. He believed. 
</P>
<P>
We accepted him on the basis of his USC work and received the high-school 
transcript later. There wasn't a great deal in his high school records that 
would predict success for him in college. That element was not evident in 
anything we had on paper, but was very evident in the interview. He had 
tremendous confidence. He was spectacularly motivated in the sense that he 
believed he could accomplish whatever he wished. And, more important, he was 
willing to do what was necessary to achieve his goals. 
</P>
<P>
Earning his degree, overcoming a knee injury, winning the one-on-one, dealing 
with the death of his best friend and bringing together a team after the 
tragedy of Gathers' death are both testimony and tribute to his belief in his 
own self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo believed" is a significant element in the success story of Bo in the 
classroom and on the court. A second element, namely the system -- that is, the 
university -- must also come into play. First, the system has to function 
properly, right from the beginning. Universities must develop ways to evaluate, 
to judge this intangible of "believing." Universities now look at courses, at 
grades, at SAT scores, at teachers' and counselors' recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
High school athletic stars are brought to campuses, interviewed by coaches, by 
faculty members, by learning-resource people and even occasionally by academic 
vice presidents. But are we asking the right questions? Are we looking for the 
right information? How are we evaluating the likelihood of success for this 
young person? Does he wish to develop his talents and skills so that he can be 
a contributing person to society, not just to a basketball player? Does he want 
to read better, write better, communicate better? Is he interested in questions 
and problems, not just his own, but others? Is searching for answers more 
important than just being given answers? 
</P>
<P>
These are not easy questions to ask, not easy questions for an 18-year-old high 
school basketball star to answer. As a matter of fact, they are probably not 
the easiest questions for any 18-year-old to answer. But these may be the 
questions we need to address when we interview scholarship athletes. I am not 
sure SAT scores tell us very much. The high school curriculum and grades offer 
a view of the past, but if the past is an inner-city environment these things 
may not tell us much about a possible future. What Bo proved is that believing 
in himself may be the most important ingredient for success in a college 
education. Universities need to understand and develop ways of evaluating this 
belief in young athletes, not just belief in themselves as athletes, but also 
as student athletes. 
</P>
<P>
One additional thought on assessing this most difficult character trait or 
attitude in a young athlete: If we are unable to determine its presence or 
absence in the interview process, perhaps we need a full year to assess 
students. Perhaps we need to ask these young people to come to college and go 
to school, to learn, to prove to themselves and to others that they can and 
want to learn. Often their backgrounds do not automatically qualify them to 
believe that they can succeed. A year of learning, with minimal basketball, 
might accomplish wonders. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Bo and Hank, they had one year in which they were not permitted 
to compete, which helped create perspective and stability. Of all the selfish 
and self-serving rules that the NCAA continues to promulgate, freshman 
eligibility is at the top of the list. I will never understand why university 
presidents have not stood up to the system and said that all freshmen come to 
school first, play basketball or football second. Then, by the end of a true 
freshman experience, a true college experience, the student athlete may well 
believe that he can complete his education, earn a degree and contribute to 
society in many, many ways other than sports. 
</P>
<P>
If belief is there, the system can and will work. It worked for Bo and Hank. It 
can work for others. Paul Westhead refers to his style of basketball coaching 
as "run the system." Bo proved that you can "run the system" off the court, 
too. Lots of people need to be committed to making the system work: coaches, 
faculty, support people, family, friends. Just as in basketball, the system 
will fail unless everyone is playing together and supporting one another. The 
system should work for far, far more of our student athletes than it is doing, 
whether at LMU or hundreds of other institutions of higher learning. 
</P>
<P>
On May 12, 1990, we presented Bo Kimble with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 
communications. We presented a degree to an educated young adult, a young man 
who is able to think, to reflect, to understand and to communicate. He has 
dealt with pain, in himself and in others. He has seen suffering, even death, 
and moved forward. He has rallied his friends, faced his competitors, won and 
lost, and moved on. Bo learned because Bo believed in himself. Bo ran the 
system on and off the court. I do not know whether Bo will be a star in the 
National Basketball Assn. What's more important, he is ready and able to lead a 
useful, productive and rewarding life. 
</P>
<P>
If the past is an inner-city environment, high school grades may not tell us 
much about a person's college future.

By GREGORY NAIMAN, former president of the Assn. of Graduate Business Students 
at USC, is an advocate of student volunteerism. He commented on the image of 
students pursuing MBA degrees: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MBA students are not perceived as being particularly sensitive to the needs of 
their community. We have tended to be very focused on getting that MBA degree 
and getting out into business. 
</P>
<P>
We have probably placed too much emphasis on career . . . but that image has 
been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
We are beginning to let people know that we care. Close to 500 MBA students at 
USC donated time and money to community causes in 1989 and 1990. That number is 
close to the entire number enrolled on a full-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
We recently raised $1,700 for the homeless. We've done work with Big Brothers 
and Big Sisters. Some students did personal finance for the rehabilitated 
homeless, lending advice on financial matters to people trying to put their 
lives back together. 
</P>
<P>
MBA students are getting more involved in communities surrounding their 
schools. As future business leaders, it's incumbent upon us to be leaders of 
our community as well.

CALL A SUMMIT FOR CITIES, POOR HITTING BOTTOM; 
</P>
<P>
AS IN EASTERN EUROPE, IF PEOPLE'S NEEDS ARE NOT MET THEY WILL REPLACE THEIR 
LEADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson writes a syndicated column from 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There have been three important summits recently. Such meetings are useful 
instruments. And that is why we need a new kind of summit for the people of 
urban and rural America. 
</P>
<P>
Summits foster direct communication, break down barriers and build 
relationships. The Bush-Gorbachev meeting in Washington continued to reduce 
tensions East and West and built bridges of understanding between the Soviet 
and American peoples -- even as Mikhail Gorbachev sought U.S. economic 
assistance for the ailing Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the NATO summit in London. With the changes taking place in the 
Soviet Union, and the democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe in 1989 and 
1990, NATO is having to adjust its purpose and structure. It is shifting from 
providing stability primarily by using military might to maintaining stability 
through political and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Following the NATO meeting was the G-7 economic summit in Houston. The seven 
most industrialized nations in the world gave special attention this year to 
the environment, world agricultural policy and aid to the Soviet Union and 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Bilateral and multilateral summits help focus attention on trends and critical 
issues. They educate leaders and the general public, and they contribute to the 
public debate of important issues. 
</P>
<P>
In that spirit, what is most needed in the United States today is for President 
Bush to convene a "domestic summit." It is needed for the same reasons that the 
other summits were held: At their heart, all of these conferences focused on 
the need for social and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the unjust economic and bad social policies of the 1970s 
and 1980s appear to be cresting. The shift in wealth and income from the poor, 
the workers and the middle class to the rich has resulted in budget deficits, 
national debt, slow growth, slow job creation, high real interest rates, 
infrastructure collapse, non-competitiveness and more. 
</P>
<P>
It has also resulted in rising poverty, malnutrition, infant mortality, 
homelessness, a health-care crisis, an educational crisis, hopelessness and 
nihilism. If these underlying causes are not addressed, drugs, crime and 
violence will continue to rise also. And in response, more repressive, 
expensive and less effective policies for combatting these ills will emerge. We 
will build more jails and put more people to death. 
</P>
<P>
But how is this different from our fears about the Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe? We fear that if the underlying social and economic development needs of 
the Soviet and Eastern European people are not met, repressive and autocratic 
leaders will return to replace the current ones. They will repress democracy, 
and retreat to ineffective economic policies, in order to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
This year's international summits analyzed the problems confronting them, 
weighed the costs of inaction and came up with a plan, a budget and a timetable 
for solving them. But there is no such analysis, plan, budget and timetable for 
the social and economic redevelopment of America -- no plan for Philadelphia, 
New York or Chicago; for Flint, Mich., or Anderson, Ind., or for rural America. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, President Bush has inflamed racial fear rather than inspired our 
common hope for racial justice. In the debate over the 1990 Civil Rights Act, 
he used the term "quota bill" to incite fear and divide the people as he used 
Willie Horton in his presidential campaign for the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Why do we need a domestic summit conference? Because America needs an urban 
reinvestment plan, a rural redevelopment plan, and a plan to achieve gender 
equality and racial justice that has a budget and a timetable attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
My grandmother used to tell me how everyone would stop what they were doing and 
huddle up close to the radio when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt would 
give his fireside chats. There was hope and help in his messages. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is no such hope or help coming from the leadership in the 
White House. But if President Bush were to convene a domestic summit 
conference, inclusive of a representative and broad range of American 
leadership, and put forth a plan, budget and timetable for national economic 
and social development, the people would rise to the occasion and rally around 
him.

RICHARD EDER: MONSTER FRANKENSTEIN'S DOCTOR;

<P>
Emmanuel Carrere's "Gothic Romance" turns the dicta of contemporary literary 
theory into a sardonic mystery novel; a play of twists and reverses that mocks 
the frontier between the fictional and the real. It is what Umberto Eco did in 
"Foucault's Pendulum," and the two novels much resemble each other. 
</P>
<P>
Both are consistently and sometimes joyously clever; both are remarkably good 
at creating a world of suspense. And in both, the deconstructionist or 
deflationary process -- the joke to the effect that no figure in the story is 
any more real than something this figure may be imagining or making up a story 
about -- is a series of interlocking traps that spring at length and with 
maddening deliberateness. 
</P>
<P>
For his variation on the theme that anything written is an invention -- even 
history and biography, because although the events and personages existed, the 
way they are presented and written about is the writer's choice -- Carrere uses 
"Frankenstein" and the circumstances of its composition. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the novel, accordingly, is set in the early 19th Century at Lake 
Geneva, where Byron, Shelley and Mary Shelley shared adjoining houses and many 
rainy evenings. After a housebound spell of telling ghost stories, each decided 
to try writing one. Only Mary Shelley persisted; the result is a classic, far 
better known today than its author. This suits Carrere's purpose: the fictional 
work usurps its author. And the joke is double, of course. We have all made the 
mistake of assigning the name of the monster's creator -- Dr. Frankenstein -- 
to his creation. 
</P>
<P>
To his historical literary trio, Carrere introduces a fourth personage: Byron's 
doctor and secretary, J. William Polidori. (A similar enlargement of the 
forgotten Polidori was central to Paul West's 1988 novel, "Lord Byron's 
Doctor.") Carrere's Polidori is a drug-ruined wreck, a would-be writer, vain 
and fiercely jealous of his employer, as well as of the Shelleys. He claims, in 
fact, to have provided the inspiration for Mary's "Frankenstein"; and when hers 
is a success, he writes an alternative version. 
</P>
<P>
Carrere has made a witty pastiche in his alternative, the Polidori 
Frankenstein. Instead of constructing a creature and bringing it to life, this 
Frankenstein uses his wife, Elizabeth. He has to kill her first; she comes back 
full of life, though with a ruthless, wanton edge, and with eyes that have 
turned black. She promptly kills Frankenstein's brother, and the maid is then 
hanged for it. Frankenstein revives them both; they return, oddly fierce and, 
again, with black eyes. 
</P>
<P>
To Frankenstein's growing dismay, the killings continue and he is forced to go 
on with his work of revival. Before long, the entire city of Edinburgh -- the 
household has moved there -- is full of black-eyed zombies, and it's only a 
matter of time before Frankenstein himself will unwillingly become one of them. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the story. But it bleeds into the life of the Shelley circle. The 
Frankensteins meet the Shelleys one day at a Geneva hotel. Elizabeth tells Mary 
a cover story about her husband's work. To make sure this story will stick, and 
to mask the gradual takeover by the black-eyes, Mary is killed and then revived 
as a black-eye herself. She goes to work dutifully writing the 
pseudo-Frankenstein we read today. 
</P>
<P>
And then, this whole now-you-see-it-now-you-don't fiction-reality is hauled up 
into the present. Anne, a young woman living in Paris, is employed by a 
mysterious Captain Walton to write romances. One day, he gives her the 
manuscript of the Polidori Frankenstein to keep safe. It is stolen, and she is 
kidnapped for her own safety by Julian, another mysterious character, who tells 
her that the black-eyes -- now 98 % of the world's population -- are after her. 
</P>
<P>
Captain Walton, of course, is also the narrator in Mary Shelley's book. And 
now, in Anne's misadventures, he is both her real-life patron and one 
present-day manifestation of Polidori. Julian seems to be an alternate Polidori 
and also Lord Byron. Allan, Anne's lover, is Shelley. Not only has fiction (the 
Frankenstein stories) seeped into and taken over historical reality -- Byron 
and the Shelleys at Lake Geneva -- but both have now seeped into and taken over 
the contemporary "reality" that Anne represents. 
</P>
<P>
There are other elegant complications -- so many that these individually 
striking voices entangle and sink into a kind of heavy buzzing. Only God or 
Nature could make a bumblebee fly; fiction, I believe, needs more wing span in 
proportion to buzz-weight.

<P>
THE LION AT THE DOOR BY NEWTON THORNBURG (WILLIAM MORROW: $18.95; 288 PP.; 
0-688-08820-1) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Harris, Harris is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Newton Thornburg's latest suspense novel, big, strong, decent Tom Kohl sits 
in a Seattle bar with his cousin, Ken, and Ken's girlfriend, Diane. They are 
enjoying a light moment in the midst of darkening tragedy. Ken, driving drunk, 
has run over a pedestrian and fled rather than notify the police. The victim 
has turned out to be a gangster. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has gone along with the cover-up out of loyalty to Ken, a childhood 
playmate who took him in after Kohl's parents died and he lost the family farm 
in Illinois. Now, in the bar, Ken tells Diane jokingly about how Kohl, on a 
high school football team called the Lions, was twice named Most Valuable Lion, 
and we hear an unexpected note: 
</P>
<P>
"As (Kohl) remembered those brisk Friday nights under the lights, there was 
only one lion out on that field, and it was fear: fear of the coach and the 
crowd, fear of failure, and fear of success -- fear of life finally." 
</P>
<P>
Later, when the bodies -- including Ken's -- have begun to pile up, we hear it 
again: 
</P>
<P>
"(Kohl) was only now beginning to understand what Ken's death meant for him. . 
. . There was no one left now who really knew him. . . . (He realized) how 
totally alone he was, how bereft of his own life, his own past. . . . And he 
suddenly understood the old men who sat in bars talking at each other, never 
listening, pathetically trying to unburden themselves of histories known only 
to them, tales they would have to take to their graves." 
</P>
<P>
Such sensitivity and insight don't usually come in the same package with a guy 
who can harvest corn, build houses, overhaul diesel engines, pilot a boat and 
single-handedly dismantle an underworld empire, but the combination isn't new 
for Thornburg, who demonstrates again what good reading can be found on the 
border between genre literature and the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburg's specialty is to have a relatively innocent person stumble across a 
crime. In "To Die in California," a farmer refused to accept that his son's 
death was an accident. In "Cutter and Bone," a bitter Vietnam veteran and his 
womanizing pal pushed their pursuit of a murder suspect to the point of 
obsession, tainting themselves in the process. Elements of both plots are 
recycled in "The Lion at the Door." 
</P>
<P>
For most of this novel, Thornburg's border-straddling pays off. Along with the 
swift prose and guaranteed action of the suspense genre, he gives us vivid 
descriptions of Seattle and the Midwest and some acute and nasty commentary on 
how blue-collar workers went broke during the '80s while yuppies flourished. He 
has a good ear, too: Rural tycoons, black go-go dancers and Mafiosi all speak 
in convincing voices. 
</P>
<P>
The major characters are satisfyingly complex. If Ken weren't handsome but 
weak; if Diane weren't smart but cold; if Bobbi, the cocktail waitress who 
witnessed the cover-up, weren't flaky but country-shrewd -- in fact, if the 
bumpers on Kohl's pickup truck weren't extra stout -- the plot couldn't advance 
as it does. Yet everyone has valid personal reasons for his behavior, so that 
plot seems to grow out of character as much as the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
Only toward the end does this balance wobble. If Kohl weren't decent, he 
wouldn't stick by Ken; if he weren't big and strong, he wouldn't be able to 
avenge him. But even the beefiest ex-farmers aren't likely to win repeatedly in 
hand-to-hand combat with professional thugs. It isn't Kohl's down-home grit 
that propels him through his final heroics, but the runaway machinery of the 
plot. 
</P>
<P>
This may be a sign that Thornburg is getting bored with his specialty, careless 
about its demands or impatient with its limitations. Kohl is too nice a guy for 
the bloody task he is given; the price we pay for the excitement of the genre 
is to have him turn into a fantasy figure for a while. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a high price, in a novel as skillful and intelligent as this one. But 
it does make us wonder which side of the border Thornburg is going to work on 
next time.

THE MIND'S EYE: GRIZZLY YEARS IN SEARCH OF THE AMERICAN WILDERNESS BY DOUG 
PEACOCK (HENRY HOLT: $19.95; 296 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Peacock experienced just the kind of absurd Vietnam mishaps made legendary 
by filmmakers such as Oliver Stone: One day, he tried to keep his commander 
alive while American helicopters mistakenly rained bombs from above; the next, 
he watched his entire platoon fire rounds at an unarmed, but "suspicious" 
10-year-old. No wonder, then, that his behavior after the war also fit the 
filmic part: He blasted down a phone booth with shotgun salvos when it guzzled 
his last bit of change; left for a camping trip after packing all the necessary 
gear (a .22 magnum derringer, .357 and .44 magnum Ruger single-action handguns, 
a bolt-action rifle and 12-gauge double-barreled shotgun); and found it easier 
talking with bears than with priests. 
</P>
<P>
During one of these "conversations," however, Peacock finally began to regain 
some peace. While a grizzly he had met on a park trail was "gnashing his jaws 
and lowering his ears," the former green beret, deciding that his "shooting 
days were over," lowered his pistol. "I felt something pass between us. The 
grizzly slowly turned away from me with grace and dignity and swung into the 
timber at the end of the meadow." 
</P>
<P>
The experience distanced him from the mentality he had assumed during the war 
by helping him realize that deciding not to attack -- despite inner fears or 
officers' orders -- could be as much a sign of strength as attacking. "The 
grizzly radiated potency," Peacock explains. "He carried the physical strength 
and thorniness of disposition that allowed him to attack or kill most any time 
he cared. But, almost always, he chose not to. That was power beyond a bully's 
swaggering. It was a kind of restraint that commands awe -- a muscular act of 
grace." 
</P>
<P>
"Grizzly Years" is particularly compelling, though, because it is not the 
simple story of a man rediscovering serenity amid nature. In fact, Peacock 
seems to spend most of his time seeking out grizzlies because they are the one 
truly threatening creature in the forest. As with other rebels, from T. E. 
Lawrence to Hunter S. Thompson, Peacock lives on the edge of death because 
doing so sharpens the dimensions of life. 
</P>
<P>
By book's end, Peacock never manages to reestablish the ordinary social ties he 
lost during the war. He breaks up with his girlfriend even though they recently 
have had a child and remains in touch only with those who take a deliberate 
stand counter to the culture: solitary outlaws such as novelist Edward Abbey 
(who modeled the character George Hayduke on Peacock) and a biologist who, 
according to his boss, " 'lacked sensitivity in dealing with public-relations 
situations.' This meant that he had tried to bite a journalist from People 
Magazine." 
</P>
<P>
But loneliness is apparently the price Peacock has paid for the realization 
that the war he fought was not his own. It's a process of rebellion that seems 
to have begun when he crawled deep into a Viet Cong tunnel, passing rooms 
filled with corpses before hearing some live breathing. When he left the 
tunnel, his fellow soldiers asked him whether it was worth bombing. "I told 
them I had not found anything down there," Peacock replied, "that the tunnel 
was cold."

HOLLYWOOD JEW AND PROUD OF IT; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE WITH THE DEVIL BY KIRK DOUGLAS (RANDOM HOUSE: 320 PP.; $19.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stuart Schoffman, Schoffman, a screenwriter living in Israel, is literary 
editor of The Jerusalem Report, a new international weekly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fish, the traditional redemption symbol, seems to be the leitmotif of Kirk 
Douglas' steamy and searching first novel. In Kracow, the characters dine on 
carp; in Lisbon, cod; on the Sunset Strip, smoked salmon and caviar (the 
makings of "Jewish pizza" at Spago), and, at the home of Milt Schultz, 
Hollywood agent nonpareil, what else but gefilte fish? (Milt, closest friend of 
the book's tormented hero, movie director Danny Dennison, hates gefilte fish, 
which reminds him of "frogs in formaldehyde"). When Danny's marriage, to the 
exquisite but tragically deranged heiress, Stephanie Stoneham, goes kaput, an 
early signal is dead tropical fish floating in the couple's aquarium, which 
Danny will later smash with an empty vodka bottle. 
</P>
<P>
If the book's thematics aspire to the spiritual, its mainspring is strictly of 
the flesh. Incest (both mother-son and mother-daughter), child molestation and 
prostitution, and a bisexual menage a trois are just a few of the carnal 
possibilities offered the reader with clockwork dependability. On Page 14 (and 
this is not the first sex scene), 7-year-old Moishe Neumann and his older 
sister Rachel watch two horses copulate graphically on the south German farm 
where the family is hiding from the Nazis. Mameh (Mother) is aghast, but Tateh 
(Father) reassures his daughter that sex is quite natural. "There is . . . all 
kinds of sex," he says, and the author spares no effort in proving Tateh right. 
</P>
<P>
The Neumanns, betrayed by Hans the hired hand, are shipped to San Sabba 
concentration camp in northern Italy, where only little Moishe survives the 
war. So enraged is he over his Jewish fate that he tells the American GI who 
liberates him that he is a Gypsy named Danny, and not a Jew. Thus begins the 
big lie that forms the focus of Douglas' story. 
</P>
<P>
Danny is taken to a Catholic orphanage in Syracuse, N.Y., is adopted by an 
Episcopalian schoolteacher who takes him to movie matinees, and to bed. He 
studies film at USC, where he joins a fraternity that bars Jews, and embarks on 
a lucrative career as a director, specializing in Westerns with plots lifted 
from Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
For all his success, Danny feels empty, unfulfilled. His father, an amateur 
metal sculptor, had been a true artist. He, the crypto-Jewish hack (his 
adaptation of "The Prince and the Pauper" has triggered the tidal wave of teen 
movies), sees himself as a fake and a whore. To upgrade his situation, he 
undertakes a film version of the 15th-Century morality play "Everyman," 
against, needless to say, the advice of Milt, who sees it as too "Kafka"; " 
'Good Deeds? That's supposed to be a character? No plot. It's just one long 
sermon." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, too, is aiming at something more than mere entertainment, but he's 
less rash than his hero, and plants Danny's existential crisis upon a sturdy 
frame of melodramatic hokum: his divorce from Stephanie and the custody battle 
over their daughter, and an obsessive romance with oversexed, 20-year-old Luba, 
a London-based Polish refugee, sometime actress, budding artist, and like her 
voluptuous mother Magda, a prostitute of Olympic caliber. "Shame was not even 
in her vocabulary," writes Douglas of Luba. "He (Danny) lived with it every 
day." Luba's stunning honesty contrasts so sharply with Danny's lack thereof 
that his encounter with her drives him to cast off his deceptions and embark on 
a painful voyage of self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
"Dance With the Devil" invites comparison with Douglas' fascinating memoir, 
"The Ragman's Son" (1988), sharing with it the theme of rediscovered Jewish 
pride and no small number of incidents and characters, chief among them the 
author himself. It can't be accidental that Kirk Douglas, the all-American 
movie star who began life as Issur Danielovitch, calls his hero Danny Dennison. 
But the novel lacks the rough-hewn charm of the autobiography, if none of its 
candor and worthy ambitions; and apart from Danny, most of the 
characterizations are stuck in cliche. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Milt begins most sentences with "boychick"; the proper British ex-army 
officer who marries Magda is in fact a violent sadist; the teen-throb actor 
starring in Danny's latest film is crazed on coke; Stephanie's absurdly evil 
father, J. L. Stoneham, is "Dallas' " J. R. by way of John Huston in 
"Chinatown." And there's even a headwaiter named Tony. 
</P>
<P>
I liked a walk-on called Chaim, a Auschwitz survivor who meets Magda in a 
refugee camp. If you lapse into bitterness, he counsels her, "you lock arms 
with the Devil, and he makes you dance to his tune." Chaim's avocation is -- 
one guess -- fishing. One day Luba, aged 15, and her dog, Blue Boy, accompany 
Chaim to the river; Luba gets wet, strips off her clothes, and in a trice, 
Chaim becomes a lot less wise, and Luba downright unlikable: "Triumphant, Luba 
made love to her mother's lover on the bank of a river, next to a dead fish, 
with Blue Boy barking." 
</P>
<P>
Giddy prose, I guess, comes with the genre and offers a sort of pleasure -- in 
long supply in this book -- all its own. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit A: "In one orgasm, she had brought all his dead memories to life." 
</P>
<P>
Or B, where Danny says: " 'I had sex with my mother. . . . But she wasn't my 
real mother' . . . (Luba) molded her body against his. 'What you just said 
means a lot to me. You trust me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Enough carping. The story may be less than memorable; the characters' emotional 
states are announced -- as in a movie treatment -- rather than rendered; but 
the book is a brisk, enjoyable read, and Douglas, however unsubtly, is out to 
impart values that are worth imparting. Danny comes to realize that "helping 
others gave you such a sense of good feeling and took your mind off your own 
problems," and is reminded at book's end, by his long-lost pal Roy from the 
orphanage, now a lovable Bing Crosby-style priest, that "One is always at peace 
when one is true to oneself." 
</P>
<P>
"Moishe," said Tateh, back in Germany, "it's not easy being a Jew." For Danny 
at 55, it's as hard as ever, but there are no atheists in the foxholes, and 
mixing with young athletic Luba cannot fail to have reminded him that time is 
growing short. There is "no escape," he now knows, from being a Jew, and 
besides, as a reward for all the suffering, God "granted Jews extraordinary 
talent in proportion to their infinitesimal numbers," including the talent "to 
make movies that the world sees." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in a final scene, declaring "I must endure my pain because I am a Jew," 
Danny puts a yarmulke on his head, kneels before a crucifix, and whispers the 
bar-mitzvah-boy's credo: "Today I am a man." A bit weird, like lox-and-caviar 
pizza, but -- I gotta hand it to Kirk -- touching, too. 
</P>
<P>
Print it, it works.

A TEACHER'S WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Mathews' review of Samuel G. Freedman's "Small Victories: The Real World of 
a Teacher, Her Students &amp; Their High School" (May 20) brought back memories 
of New York's Lower East Side that haven't surfaced, except for the faintest 
ripples, in more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
How times have changed! The area was then predominantly Jewish, although there 
were also some Poles, Italians, Russians and other Middle-European immigrants 
who belonged to different religious groups. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What they had in common was their awareness that they were all, in some way, 
part of an underclass and that the only way to improve their lot was through 
hard work and schooling. 
</P>
<P>
These were boys who came to school only after having delivered papers, opened 
their fathers' small grocery stores or seen several younger members of the 
family off to school. The girls were surrogate mothers to large families, 
cooking, cleaning and sewing, and working after school when they could find 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Like today's students, they too required a great deal more of their teachers 
than often the teachers were equipped to give. I recall vividly the pain I felt 
when one girl in a civics class said she was ashamed that her father was a 
street cleaner. We spent most of that class hour trying to make her proud of 
the contribution he was making. Everyone got involved and there were a good 
many secrets revealed in class that day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I like to think that I may have helped a little. Somewhere I still have a poem 
by a young tomboy named Adele Kupchik, which, she told me, she had written to 
thank me for "making me see." I wonder what happened to Adele. I hope she 
doesn't live on Pitt Street any more.

Zhores Medvedev, in his (June 3) review of Dusko Doder's and Louise Branson's 
biography, "Gorbachev: Heretic in the Kremlin," considers it unlikely that 
Gorbachev could have had an older brother who died during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Maria Panteleevna Gorbachev did not become a teen-age mother, she could 
have had a stepson. I presume that it is correct to refer to a half-brother 
some seven years one's senior as just an "older brother." However, I doubt that 
Gorby would care to write a Russian "Roots" to clarify the matter.

Poetic and prosodic piffle need to be pinpointed. When tuition fees are so far

THE LIBRARY SWEATSHOP REVISITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing on behalf of the Librarians Assn. of the University of 
California-Los Angeles (LAUC-LA) in response to the "Endpapers" by Ron Kelley . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA Library is in the forefront of applying technological developments to 
the acquisition, processing and accessing of its vast collections. It is 
inevitable that as a traditional work environment adapts to a new technology, 
some employees may find it difficult to make the transition. This is true not 
only in the library, but in any work environment in which automation has 
altered the way information is being processed. 
</P>
<P>
Large research libraries are no longer a quiet refuge from the turbulence of 
the world. Vast amounts of information must be organized so that 
access/retrieval is possible. The computer has made this traditional library 
mission easier to accomplish; unfortunately, like most changes, it has raised 
other issues that need our attention. 
</P>
<P>
The negative portrayal of librarians presented by Kelley is far removed from 
the reality of the 150 librarians at UCLA. Librarians at the University of 
California are academic appointees who have completed a Master of Library 
Science program and are professionally active in state and national 
associations. The charge that "librarians typically achieve only the minimal 
level of 'computer literacy' to do their jobs" is particularly galling, since 
most of us spend many hours using computers to enable us to improve the quality 
of service we offer to the University community. 
</P>
<P>
As professionals, we are involved in all aspects of ORION, UCLA's 
state-of-the-art on-line information system, from its development and 
implementation to instructing library staff and library patrons in its use. 
</P>
<P>
One of the characteristics that does indeed separate librarians from library 
assistants is the broad perspective and core of knowledge that comes from the 
graduate education required for appointment.

'BREWSTER'S MILLIONS' MEETS 'DALLAS'; 
</P>
<P>
TYCOON BY TERRY PRINGLE (ALGONQUIN BOOKS: $18.95; 281 PP; 0-945575-30-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Laura Furman, Furman is a novelist and short-story writer who teaches at the 
University of Texas at Austin. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is sometimes said of the son of a rich man, "He was born on third base and 
thinks he hit a triple." 
</P>
<P>
"Tycoon," Terry Pringle's third novel, is narrated by William C. Brewster III, 
a rich boy who is content to stay on third all his life, commenting on the 
foibles and difficulties of those at bat. 
</P>
<P>
The setting for Pringle's novel is Abilene, Tex., a small city in west Texas 
dominated by money, oil and religion. The Brewster family is well established 
in Abilene, high up in the social ranking, having made its money early in oil, 
and having managed to hang on to that fortune. It took grit and daring for 
Boomer, Billy's grandfather, to prevail as an early wildcatter. It took savvy 
and determination for Billy's father to build an oil-exploration business that 
survives the cycle of good and bad times characteristic of the oil business. 
</P>
<P>
"The stories the two men told were as different as they were. Boomer would tell 
me about the time he'd rented a pool table to sleep on in Beaumont, with every 
room, cot and barber chair already taken . . . only to awaken the next morning 
to learn his boots had been stolen right off his feet. My old man would counter 
with a story about the time he'd plugged a well with drilling mud all by 
himself, carrying it in five-gallon buckets by hand from the mud pit, a process 
which had taken a week." 
</P>
<P>
But for Billy to excel -- that would take desire, and the only thing Billy 
Brewster exhibits much desire for in the whole novel is another chance to go to 
bed with his childhood sweetheart, Sally Ann. Early on, he explains, "Half the 
time we were good friends, half the time lovers, and she could behave so 
unpredictably she normally was driving me crazy. Her reasoning always was, 'I'm 
trying to keep things interesting.' " She refuses to marry him because it would 
ruin their good thing. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Ann is beautiful, rich, and wild (for Abilene), a male fantasy come true 
-- she is always seductive, always elusive, and nearly always willing. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Stanley Gaines, the son of a poor widow with a bad reputation. He is 
gawky, badly dressed and from the wrong side of town. As a boy, he was the butt 
of jokes, and Billy witnessed Stan urinating on his tormentors. As a man, Stan 
Gaines has a shameless aggression that will get him what he wants. And what he 
wants is essentially to be what Billy Brewster is -- socially accepted, rich 
and secure. With Billy's help, he gets a job with Brewster Drilling, persuades 
a stubborn landowner to permit drilling on her property, and his career is off 
the ground. With no background, knowledge or training, Stanley Gaines is an oil 
tycoon in the making. 
</P>
<P>
It is through Gaines' career in oil and real estate that Pringle narrates the 
economic history of Texas from 1965 to the 1980s. With no capital and nothing 
but "his best Dale Carnegie manner," Stan Gaines succeeds. He impresses Billy's 
father, who has been looking for a spark from his own son and never finds it. 
</P>
<P>
Stan becomes a partner in Brewster Drilling and founds Gaines Petroleum. He 
expands into real estate. He moves to Dallas, where all good media-Tex tycoons 
go to show off. (In the TV series "Dallas," Texas is not portrayed, but rather 
the mythical land of Media-Tex.) And, eventually, Gaines goes bankrupt, the 
latest plot twist in tales of the Texas rich. 
</P>
<P>
Although the economic drama takes up much of the energy of the novel, the only 
Gaines victory that stirs the narrator is Stan's wooing and winning of Sally 
Ann. The play of the poor man against the rich man is complete. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines seems to be taking Billy Brewster's place everywhere -- in his father's 
affection, in business, in love. Lucky Billy, born with everything, ends up 
with some money, a son he loves in a grudging way and a wife he despises. He 
narrates what should be a story of a triangle of frustration and failure -- 
each man keeping what the other really wants. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Pringle's gifts as a writer do not live up to his ambition. The 
loping, good-humored tone of the narrative is without variety, so that when 
Brewster comes back from Vietnam, finally angry about something, he sounds like 
an article from Time magazine. He professes to love his son, but the love never 
is convincing in action. He professes to be obsessed with finding out the 
secret of Stan Gaines' past, but the secrets turn out to be not so much and not 
so interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, the reader doesn't know how to react. The heroic Boomer's death is 
recounted in this way: "My grandfather had passed on during 'General Hospital,' 
and the last words he'd spoken had been: I told you to stay away from that 
woman. My mother had found him sitting in his ragged rocker-recliner, head 
forward, chin on his chest. . . . Boomer had watched the cattle come up the 
Western Trail, had been part of the free-wheeling, nitro-shooting, leg-to-leg 
derrick days. Control over the price of oil had passed out of the hands of the 
Texas Railroad Commission -- and out of the country altogether. With the death 
of Boomer and the Arab oil embargo, I somehow felt cut off, drifting. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I suppose it would be possible, in the hands of a master writer, to feel a lump 
in the throat at the thought of the losses suffered by the Texas Railroad 
Commission. But Pringle's characters are too wooden, flat and unchanging for 
the reader to feel much for them. Nostalgia for the Golden West has gone a long 
way in American entertainment and letters, but it doesn't really work here. The 
nostalgia strikes a particularly sour note in Billy and Sally Ann's pining for 
the comancheria, of which Abilene was a part before whites killed or ran off 
the Indians. Pity the poor capitalist, the novel seems to be demanding. Only if 
the writing were extraordinary would one be tempted. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the story goes on too long. Adultery between Sally Ann and Billy goes 
on until even Billy understands that Sally Ann's husband knows and doesn't 
care. The older generation passes through -- Billy's mother simply disappears 
from the book after she performs her Good Woman task of urging her son into a 
bad marriage. Stan's mother, Melissa, whom Pringle attempts to make an echo of 
Sally Ann's wanton sexuality with the added twist of Evangelical Christianity, 
never really becomes convincing, either as a seductress or as a religious 
tyrant to her son. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, when reading a novel about West Texans one thinks of Larry 
McMurtry. McMurtry's characters often are broadly drawn, but his energetic 
prose and infallible sense of story make his characters both touching and 
larger than life. McMurtry's people have the ring of truth, even his women, of 
whom Pringle's Sally Ann is a faint, literary cousin. McMurtry's portraits, 
even of scoundrels, are filled with affection and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Without a strong narrative gift, a novel such as Pringle's comes to sound 
didactic. It is full of information about the oil business but it lacks 
compelling characters. Unless the reader really cares about the oil business, 
the characters seem like an excuse for a novel, rather than its cause. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle's ambitious novel of West Texans and their loves and money fails 
because the prose is too ordinary, the characters too thin and the story not 
intriguing enough. For all the vast amounts of money mentioned, and all the 
barrels of oil, for the whole laborious process of getting rich and becoming 
poor detailed here, one can only say that Pringle's West Texas is too small.

A MARRIAGE (RE)MODELED ON GENESIS; 
</P>
<P>
ONION BY KATE BRAESTRUP (VIKING: $17.95; 194 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lynne Bundesen, Bundesen is a free-lance writer living in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a great book packaged badly. "Onion" is a story about the most 
difficult imaginable relationship: genuine heterosexual intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
From its obscure title and soft-mauve cover sporting a small etching of a cut 
onion, you might guess that it was a culinary love story. You would never guess 
that this is a brilliant, original, transforming, nourishing, profoundly 
religious, Biblically based story about spirituality, marriage, motherhood, 
husbands and lovers. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Elliot, its heroine, is a young woman married to a strong, caring, nice 
man -- a policeman. She thinks about, cares for and loves her young son, called 
"Onion." Her narrative concerns her abortion, her best girlfriend, her need for 
meaning, connection, security, her spiritual rebirth. She is Eve re-visioned. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen overcomes temptation and recognizes her spiritual origin. She revises her 
human history in the light of the most inspired interpretation of Biblical 
creation. She finds peace, love and happiness in her marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Viking has wrapped the book in a dust jacket that pitches "Onion" as a novel 
about Ellen Elliot, a feminist theologian, housewife and mother with esoteric 
sexual fantasies about a professor of electromagnetic physics. I quote from the 
inside flap: "As Ellen's and Potocka's imagined affair -- as much dialectic as 
erotic -- proceeds through discussions of Ohm's Law and Gnostic theology, it 
provides a counterpoint for Ellen's exploration of her past. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Say what? 
</P>
<P>
Apparently Viking was not going for the numbers. There are hardly more women 
who would rather curl up with a book about esoteric university types engaged in 
mental foreplay than there are regular, average women, mothers hungering for 
spiritual nourishment drawn from the Bible. What there is, I think, is an 
imaginary line drawn in the publishing business. 
</P>
<P>
That imaginary line separates "Christian" or "Religious" publishing from 
publishing, as if people who read the Bible are not people who read books that 
might find their way to the New York Times best-seller list. I don't want to 
accuse, only suggest that Viking is hiding the light of "Onion" under a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind. If you are one of the 70 million-plus women in the United States 
who attend church and read the Bible regularly, or if you are at all curious 
about what the Bible really says about the initial relationship between men and 
women, "Onion" is a must read. It dishes out Genesis smartly and succinctly. I 
quote from Page 56: "There are two distinct accounts of this inception in 
Genesis 1 and 2, and which you decide to quote most has tended, over the 
centuries, to depend on your sexual politics." 
</P>
<P>
Think of "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance." Then think of Phaedrus, 
universities and motorcycles replaced by God, theology and motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
The publicity that accompanied the reviewer's copy trivialized the book beyond 
all belief by likening it to "Diary of a Mad Housewife." Perhaps they did not 
look deeply enough inside its cover to the meat of this contemporary moral and 
spiritual tale of a young woman's daily life. Too bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Onion" is a sensitive and insightful sermon. From Page 186: "God made creating 
Her image in the conduct of an ordinary everyday human life a matter of effort. 
Why on earth would receiving God's blessings be as easy as only saying the 
right words once a week, when our well lived lives would be the finer prayer? 
And why, while we're on the subject, should God be something that blesses us 
outright, when it makes so much more sense that She would have encoded our 
blessings in the richness of our human intercourses, that we are meant to be 
each other's blessings?" 
</P>
<P>
And yet a tale that culminates in the epiphany of the female protagonist -- 
"That this at last is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone" -- is 
characterized by its publicists as "a tender and amusing look at the modern 
woman's predicament." No woman I know ever has characterized her married life 
or her struggle for spiritual identity and sexual union under the God of the 
Bible as a "tender and amusing predicament." 
</P>
<P>
Braestrup's book is a novel about a religious experience. It echoes Luke's 
report of Jesus' words: "To what can I compare the Kingdom of God? It is like 
yeast that a woman took and hid in a bushel of flour till it all rose" (Luke 
13:21).

CRAZED ABORTION MOM KIDNAPS FIRST LADY; 
</P>
<P>
THE AMENDMENT BY SUE ROBINSON (BIRCH LANE PRESS/ CAROL PUBLISHING GROUP: 
$17.95; 237 PP.; 0-55971-018-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rebecca Novelli, Novelli is a free-lance writer who has written frequently 
on legal and social issues for educational publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Set in the future, "The Amendment" begins in New Orleans where abortion 
conservatives are celebrating their victory: the ratification of a 
constitutional amendment denying all women in America the option of legal and 
safe abortions. Until recently, this premise seemed remote, perhaps even 
contrived. However, the passage in Louisiana legislature of an almost identical 
statute gives "The Amendment" a chilling prescience. 
</P>
<P>
The novel turns on a plot to kidnap First Lady Mary Morgan, leader of the 
Rights for the Unborn League, and to extort from her and the League the huge 
sum that will be required to set up an underground that will provide American 
women safe abortions in Sweden. Most readers will already have strong emotions 
and opinions on the subject of abortion. Author Sue Robinson, a former United 
Press International and Associated Press reporter, surely knows that their 
intense feelings will help carry this story and hold it together. 
</P>
<P>
The book exploits a white hats/black hats, David-and-Goliath mentality. The 
narrow-minded injustice and hypocrisy of the league engages the reader's own 
sense of vulnerability. A Southern-backwater sort of evil fills the reader with 
suspense: How will the league, now at the height of its power, be stopped? 
</P>
<P>
We know -- and hope we are wrong -- that young, innocent Hilary Foster, and the 
courageous physician who has risked his career to help her, will die at the 
hands of one of the league's back-street patrols that search out and destroy 
illegal abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Thus set up, I accepted the proposition that Hilary's unconventional but 
heretofore law-abiding mother will kidnap the First Lady. I wanted to know 
whether Mrs. Foster would elude the cynical Jack Riley, the league's mercenary 
bloodhound, who sniffs out her scheme. 
</P>
<P>
It was easy to side with Robinson's good guys, who also include a warm-hearted 
nurse in love with the murdered doctor/musician who, we are reminded, will play 
the dulcimer no more; the bright, capable Elizabeth McKinley, who suddenly 
finds meaning in life in avenging her best friend's death; a respectable 
girls'-school dean who risks her own position (Jean Harris with a good cause?) 
to help young ladies in need of abortions. Never mind that these characters are 
white, affluent, educated and very well-connected, or that their possible 
success will most likely benefit their sisters who are similarly situated. 
</P>
<P>
The bad-guy league members are the kinds of sanctimonious uglies we love to 
hate. Robinson pointedly suggests at the outset that they are contemptible: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . First Lady Mary Holt Morgan's voice vibrated to a high- fever pitch, 
soaring on hot-fevered wings across the high golden ceiling of the Louisiana 
Superdome, reaching out to the multitudes gathered there, their sweat-streaked 
bodies jammed tightly into every high-backed bleacher seat . . . their hot, 
shining eyes were fastened on the podium on the ramrod-straight, triumphant 
figure of the First Lady of the United States . . . the sweat of this exultant 
capacity crowd reeked not of the sour, salted crust of fatted perspiration, it 
ran sweet instead, sweet and pure as only the mother's milk of the righteous is 
sweet and pure . . . Saint Mary of the terrible swift sword of righteousness . 
. . Saint Mary, the glorious blond Madonna of the forces for life." 
</P>
<P>
Readers familiar with Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale" may be reminded 
of Serena Joy, another evangelical figure whose zeal in saving the unborn also 
is equaled only by her own self-deception and barrenness. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's overwrought and peculiarly repetitive style has a distracted -- and 
distracting -- life of its own. The volume of images (heat, lights, circles, 
mirrors, eyes, darkness, and especially sweat) stupefy like a night of restless 
dreams. Repetition of names, words, phrases and syntax, a mannerism currently 
practiced with success by Joan Didion, often seems to abduct the author 
herself, leaving the reader in a confusion of pointless echoes and mixed 
metaphors: ". . . It was Jonathan's eyes that startled Elizabeth. They were an 
extremely light blue, an almost transparent blue, as if lights were on behind 
them, and set in Jonathan's slender, aquiline face, and punctuated by his light 
eyelashes and eyebrows and his light-blond hair, his light eyes seemed to 
glitter across a long distance at Elizabeth, glittering transparently like 
clear water in bright sun. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Readers in search of an examination of the issue of abortion or the subtleties 
of sex and politics will not linger over "The Amendment" -- obviously. In fact, 
this novel is so generic that any of a number of other issues -- gun control, 
for instance -- could provoke equal emotional intensity for readers and provide 
a backdrop for this plot. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson relieves the reader of any responsibility for logic or consideration 
of diverse views and claims -- not to mention the broader contemplation of the 
meaning of life or the taking of it. The shape of our thinking on the matter of 
abortion and other gender issues and its implications is far better exposed in 
"The Handmaid's Tale." 
</P>
<P>
"The Amendment" entertains in the mechanical way a bizarre amusement park 
attraction entertains: a ride in the gloom accompanied by lots of special 
effects and action, but, in the daylight an experience that would be easy to 
forget were it not for its particular relevance to our darkest fears. 
</P>
<P>
It's summertime. For a quick thrill, take "The Amendment" on the airplane or to 
the beach and pass it on to a friend. With that idea in mind, more practical 
abortion liberals may want to wait for the paperback edition, and, meanwhile, 
write to their legislators.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: UNTOUCHABLE BY MULK RAJ ANAND (PENGUIN: $6.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a sweeper whose hereditary labor requires him to come in contact with dung, 
Bakha, the central character of Mulk Anand's novel, ranks among the lowest 
members of the lowest caste. Bright, strong and disciplined, he dreams of a 
better life while enduring the endless insults of his higher-caste neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Anand devotes nearly three-quarters of the book to Bakha's mistreatment (which 
becomes both repetitive and boring), then tries to shoehorn the bulk of the 
plot into the last few pages. After listening to a lecture by an ineffectual 
Salvation Army missionary and a speech by Mahatma Gandhi, Bakha decides that 
modern plumbing can remove the stigma of defilement and solve Indian's caste 
problem, a revelation that ends the book on a weak note. "Untouchable" is most 
interesting for its portrait of life under an ancient and virulent system of 
prejudice.

Marian Thurm's prose has a straightforward clarity that captures the essential 
details of her character's lives in these wry short stories. In "Sanctuary," a 
gay man, stuck at the bar mitzvah of his lover's only son, finds an unexpected 
ally in his lover's ex-wife; a divorcee struggles to overcome her father's 
conviction that she's messing up yet again when she decides to marry for a 
second time in "Flying." Thurm notes the follies and neuroses of daily life in 
urban America with the seemingly innocent fascination of a child watching the 
inhabitants of an ant farm.

<P>
D. H. Lawrence is the flip side of James Joyce. They are as Protestant to 
Catholic, country to city. 
</P>
<P>
Their celebratory rituals, the literary conferences, are as Vatican Council to 
Methodist encampment. The Joyceans are superbly organized. The James Joyce 
International Foundation holds an international symposium every second year in 
a place relevant to Joyce. The in-between year is filled by a conference in the 
United States. American Joyceans simply cannot go 24 months without convening. 
</P>
<P>
No Joycean has to wonder about the date. Joyce, Jesuitically trained, created 
his own personal ecclesiastical calendar. Conferences are held on the days 
surrounding either June 16 -- Bloomsday, the date on which the action of his 
masterpiece, "Ulysses," is set -- or his birthday, Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrenceans, like their author, are as rambling as an English garden. They 
never know when their next conference is coming, nor where. Lawrence wandered 
the globe before dying in Venice in 1930 at age 44. This summer, a combination 
of academic friendships and local largesse (plastic briefcases courtesy of the 
Conseil de la Region Herault) brought them to Montpellier in southwestern 
France, which last month saw the first major international gathering of 
Lawrenceans since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Joyce conference, which ended on June 16, was held in Monaco, the home of 
the Princess Grace Irish Library. Very few from Monaco made the journey 
westward to Montpellier. Lawrenceans are a different order from Joyceans. 
Joyceans believe in The Word. Lawrenceans believe in The Man. "I read Lawrence 
to learn about life," Prof. Chong-wha Chung of Korea University in Seoul told 
me. 
</P>
<P>
For those who braved them both, the conferences gave an opportunity to compare 
the two incompatible breeds. Absurdities both -- the Joyce, with nearly 300 
delegates, absurdly elegant and overproduced; the Lawrence, half that size, 
maddeningly scruffy, sweaty and ramshackle. Yet both were full of bright, 
genial people, mainly university teachers, willing to devote five days 
(Lawrence) or a full week (Joyce) to debating the meaning of life and love and 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce, who was born in 1882 and died in 1941, and Lawrence have much in common: 
two thin, shy, sickly, monogamous men who stayed clear of World War I, to write 
instead of the other war -- the war between the sexes. With their work, they 
changed the novel and burst the bonds of censorship for those who write in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrenceans, as a group, seem older, heavier and less merry than Joyceans. 
Their beards and sandals and loose shirts only accentuated the impression of a 
crowd of Lawrence look-alikes. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence seems to attract more American professors with last-for-first names, 
far fewer theorists, hardly a Marxist in the lot and few post-structuralists. 
In general, according to a leading American Lawrencean, Keith Cushman of North 
Carolina, they are far less cosmopolitan. 
</P>
<P>
"Joyce was truly international," he said. "Lawrence was much-traveled. But 
wherever he went, he remained English." 
</P>
<P>
But Lawrenceans give no quarter to Joyce, whom they find cerebral, unfeeling 
and, to their students, unreadable. They do not want luxury accommodation. Like 
their author, who lived in cottages and cabins from Cornwall to New Mexico, 
they are ready to rough it. 
</P>
<P>
Feminism, however, and the difference between the sexes, dominated both 
gatherings. "I hadn't expected such a gendered experience," said one Canadian 
attending her first Joyce international. At every Joyce conference there is a 
"women's caucus." 
</P>
<P>
Imagine their surprise this year, when they were told by the library that their 
speaker would be Shirley Conran, one of Monaco's resident English literati. 
"You mean, the woman who wrote 'Which of you bitches is my mother?' is going to 
talk to us about creative writing?" gasped one. 
</P>
<P>
Conran, however, cleverly sailed into the real gender dilemma of the female 
academic: how to get husbands to help with the housework. 
</P>
<P>
Academic scholars put divorce lawyers in the pale with their discussions of 
what constitutes evidence of the consummated sexual act. One American professor 
reported a student ringing up at 3 in the morning, having just finished 
"Ulysses." "Do Molly and Bloom sleep together again?" he demanded. (She 
couldn't say.) 
</P>
<P>
The Lawrenceans waded into real anatomy in discussing the "Excurse" chapter in 
"Women in Love." What actually happened down around the "back and base" of the 
loins? They were told of one academic couple -- named -- who took the book into 
bed with them and tried to work out what was supposed to be fitting into what. 
The result? No satisfaction nor elucidation. 
</P>
<P>
And Lawrence, the self-styled Priest of Love, himself? In a panel on biography, 
Jeffrey Meyers of the University of Colorado, whose "D. H. Lawrence" recently 
was published by Alfred A. Knopf (see Page 1), described an interview with the 
painter Dorothy Brett in which all he wanted to know is "Did you screw Murry 
(John Middleton Murry) in 1919"? (Cries from the floor: "She did!") 
</P>
<P>
More seriously, had Brett and Lawrence had actually "done it" in Ravello in 
1926? Brett, according to one version, said that Lawrence tried but failed, 
excusing the failure with a comment on a part of Brett's anatomy which he said 
was "wrong." 
</P>
<P>
My text reads "pubes" for the part in question. Another version has, instead, 
an American word rhyming with "pubes" but referring to another part of the 
anatomy. The learned consensus was that "pubes" was decidedly more Lawrencean 
than that American vulgarism. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrenceans, more than Joyceans, love the master's words read aloud. They 
linger lovingly over phrases like "a tumbling heap of pink petals." Unhappily, 
the same love envelops their own words. Long papers, honed on word processors 
in Tulsa or Swansea, were delivered in inaudible monotone to listeners 
somnolent in the Mediterranean heat. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Joyceans blur the line between art and life. (Some suggest that 
"Finnegan's Wake" contains hidden clues about incestuous relations between 
Joyce and his daughter.) Lawrenceans do it all the time. Seeing Lawrence as a 
prophet, complete with beard, piercing eyes and untimely death, they seem to 
expect a Second Coming. "The world needs Lawrence today," said one woman, "more 
than ever." 
</P>
<P>
But nobody's perfect. Anthony Burgess, Monaco's reigning literary monarch, said 
in the Joyceans' opening speech: "I write for a living. Joyce never did." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrenceans more openly acknowledge imperfections in their god: 
repetitiousness, poor endings, violence toward his fictional women, and toward 
his real-life wife, Frieda, too. Mark Spilka, speaking not only as a professor 
at Brown University but as a worker with "Wife-Abusers of Rhode Island," said 
jovially that Lawrence "would qualify for sentencing under current law." 
</P>
<P>
In death, both writers are united by 1990s problems with editions and estates. 
The Joyce world is in disarray over the "correct" text of "Ulysses," which 
contains many errors. Its scholars too write in fear of the author's grandson, 
Stephen Joyce, who appeared before them to say that he was taking a personal 
interest in all matters concerning his late grandfather. "You may not like it," 
he told them, "but that's the way it's going to be." 
</P>
<P>
The re-editing of Lawrence is even more controversial because Cambridge 
University Press considers that the new editions create new works of all the 
books, thus extending the copyright well into the new century. Gerald 
Pollinger, whose literary agency controls the Lawrence estate, is never shy of 
reminding writers that they must pay him for use of copyright material. 
</P>
<P>
At the Lawrenceans' final "banquet" -- self-service in the university cafeteria 
-- Pollinger, tall, heavy, powerful, strode to the microphone like the chairman 
of the governors at an orphanage's Open Day. He told little jokes. He gave away 
trinkets. Then he gave some unsettling news: 
</P>
<P>
A fine trove of new Lawrence material has been found -- letters from his 
Croydon years, documents, perhaps even a short story or two. . . . The Lawrence 
scholars would not have long to wait to see it. It would all be put up for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Preston of the University of Nottingham, amiable organizer of the 
conference, then announced that the university (near Lawrence's birthplace) is 
to set up a D. H. Lawrence International Centre and will bid for the new 
Lawrence material. 
</P>
<P>
Nottingham against the big American university libraries? In my view, it 
doesn't stand a chance. Unless, of course, a fairy princess comes along.

INTIFADA SHOWING SIGNS OF FAILURE, DISCONTENT;

ISRAEL: ARABS DISPLAY UNHAPPINESS AT MOUNTING PHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC LOSSES. 
INFIGHTING IS INCREASING.

IDNA, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Arab uprising, which for 31 months has been the focus of the Palestinian 
quest for independence, is showing signs of disintegrating. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the intifada, as the uprising is called in Arabic, continues 
without significant change: daily commercial strikes, spasms of stone throwing, 
cat-and-mouse resistance to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
If it is not actually winding down, it appears to be entering a new phase. No 
longer do you hear the triumphant cry that "an independent state is just a 
stone's throw away." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, there are hints of failure, murmurings of discontent at the mounting 
physical and economic losses. Fingers are being pointed -- at the Palestinian 
leadership in the occupied territories and at the Palestine Liberation 
Organization operating in exile. There are violent factional disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, a political leader of the uprising, recently told an 
Arabic-language newspaper: 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't control ourselves and unify our ranks, and (instead) allow tribal 
and factional differences to act up, then we will fail, and the price will be 
returning to square one." 
</P>
<P>
This sense of malaise dovetails with new Israeli government policy, which 
focuses not so much on asserting control at every moment in every town and 
village as on keeping the revolt at manageable levels. In some instances, the 
absence of Israeli troops on regular patrols has led to infighting and 
lawlessness among the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, Arab political leaders talk of the need to refocus the energies of 
the population. Such is the fragmentation of the underground leadership that it 
is not clear whether any person or group can take charge. Arrests and dogged 
pursuit by Israeli troops, who have sometimes targeted and shot down well-known 
activists in the street, have taken their toll. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the confidence of the people in the promise of the intifada is 
being lost," said Hamdi Farraj, a Palestinian journalist in Bethlehem. "We look 
for the intifada leadership to come up with new thinking." 
</P>
<P>
In May, an outpouring of street protests following the shooting of seven 
Palestinian workers in Rishon Le Zion by a civilian Israeli gunman was seen as 
a boost of adrenaline for the uprising. Mass demonstrations, combined with an 
intense army crackdown -- 21 Palestinians were shot to death -- seemed to 
signal a revival of the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
But the passion of Rishon Le Zion, as it developed, was an exception. Clearly, 
the Palestinians' distaste for the occupation had not flagged, but this was not 
channeled into new tactics. Palestinians quickly returned to sporadic, and 
sometimes self-destructive, activity. 
</P>
<P>
In Idna, a treeless hill town near Hebron, the uprising has been suspended 
because of a bloody dispute among families connected with different PLO 
factions -- with the Communist Party and the Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine on the one hand and with Fatah, the main faction of the PLO, on 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
Power struggles, religious differences -- the Communists and the PFLP are 
viewed as godless -- and family rivalries that predate the uprising are at the 
heart of the feuding. All this came to a boil in early July, when a Communist 
activist threw a hand grenade into a group of rivals, killing three youths, 
including a 13-year-old passer-by. 
</P>
<P>
"All the good done in Idna for the intifada has been obscured by this attack," 
an elderly resident said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Idna feud is the most heated, clashes have been reported 
elsewhere, mostly between Muslim activists and secular members of the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, a row between PLO members and rivals 
from the Muslim group Hamas turned violent after the PLO group spread rumors 
that a Muslim was a homosexual. Two PLO youths were stabbed and severely 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
At a mosque in Battir, a village near Bethlehem, Koranic books were ripped up, 
fueling a simmering quarrel. In the Israeli prison camp of Ketziot, Muslim 
prisoners from Gaza wrote a public letter accusing PLO inmates of abusing them. 
</P>
<P>
For many months of the uprising, as seasoned activists were jailed or killed 
off, youths ranging in age from the early teens to the mid-20s formed the core 
of the uprising. Some Palestinians worried that this youthfulness would lead to 
careless abuses of authority, something already highlighted by the continued 
assaults on suspected collaborators. Now, this practice may be expanding. 
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem and Hebron, high school gangs have forced teachers to rig final 
examinations to ensure that militants pass and get a chance at a college 
education. These strong-arm tactics are rationalized on the grounds that the 
students have not had enough time to study in the months since schools were 
reopened by the Israeli government. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just look at the final test," one student told an interviewer. "You 
have to look at the past three years. We have been throwing stones, we have 
been working for our society. We need help." 
</P>
<P>
A surge of robberies and shakedowns in Bethlehem has created tension between 
merchants and street activists. In one incident, a teen-ager demanded about 
$200 from a storekeeper, who refused. The storekeeper appealed to political 
leaders in Jerusalem for support, and they agreed that he should not pay. 
Still, the youth returned to the store, with friends, and demanded twice as 
much money -- and got it. 
</P>
<P>
Elias Freij, the mayor of Bethlehem, has complained of a rash of car thefts and 
break-ins at stores, compounded in his view by Israeli soldiers who are eager 
to stop demonstrators but uninterested in stopping petty crime. In one case, a 
municipal car was stolen from a guarded city lot. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no solution," Freij said, "unless people realize that the intifada 
requires people to be disciplined. Those who commit crimes are 
anti-nationalist." 
</P>
<P>
Generational resentment underlies some of the shakedowns. Younger activists 
commonly accuse veterans of withholding PLO money and pocketing the funds. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, a reporter visiting Nablus was in a drugstore interviewing Said 
Kanaan, a PLO contact, when three youths walked in and told Kanaan they were 
collecting money for a prisoner relief fund. He gave them a few shekels and, 
after they had gone, said: 
</P>
<P>
"They know there is money going to prisoners, but they ask the merchants 
anyway. People are fed up with this. Groups use nationalism as a cover to get 
spending money." 
</P>
<P>
The intifada has been unable to produce new forms of protest. Large 
demonstrations and marches rarely take place. Efforts at civil disobedience 
have failed to attract adherents. Few Palestinians pay attention to leaflets 
published in the name of the underground leaders, except to note the days set 
for general strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the uprising's sagging fortunes, many of the activists are taking a 
hard look at the situation. They feel that diplomacy -- the stalled effort by 
the Bush Administration to organize Israeli-Palestinian talks -- has reached a 
dead-end. They think Washington's decision to break off talks with the PLO 
indicates a failure of moderate diplomacy and has eroded the organization's 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
There are rumblings that the PLO, by taking charge of the uprising after the 
first few months, helped create a state of paralysis. Residents of the West 
Bank and Gaza wait passively for outside developments. 
</P>
<P>
"We always felt that the PLO should be our only representative," an activist in 
Battir said. "So the inside leadership always deferred to the outside. Maybe we 
needed a strong, visible inside leadership in case the PLO failed." 
</P>
<P>
Farraj, the journalist in Bethlehem, said: "When the intifada began, the slogan 
was 'No voice speaks louder than the intifada.' But as the months went on, 
everything was concentrated on the outside. The PLO did not give local leaders 
the freedom to do what we wanted. Now, we are in a state of waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli government's response to the uprising has been evolving, 
and the present level of the revolt fits into its plans. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, shootings, mass arrests, the demolition of houses, the curtailment 
of education -- universities are still closed, although elementary and high 
schools have been reopened -- and heavy taxation have all contributed to 
wearing down the revolt. More than 650 Palestinians have died at the hands of 
Israeli soldiers, and about 20 have been killed by civilian settlers. For their 
part, the Palestinians have slain more than 230 of their own people suspected 
of informing or being involved in crimes of vice. Forty-six Israelis have died 
in violence associated with the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the last year, the Israeli army focused on putting street leaders 
out of action. Soldiers were permitted to shoot on sight Palestinians wearing 
masks. Several cases of targeting and shooting down known activists in the 
street were brought to light. Arrests and rearrests continued. There are 
between 10,000 and 15,000 Palestinians behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
A new rightist government under Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir took power in 
June and committed itself to crushing the revolt. So far, it has shown 
comparative restraint and is concentrating on keeping stone throwers from 
disrupting traffic on main West Bank and Gaza roads. As a concession to Israeli 
settlers, the government is permitting armed vigilante groups to operate. 
</P>
<P>
In June, eight Palestinians died by army gunfire, the lowest monthly total 
since the uprising began. For the first time, none were killed in Gaza, 
although a Palestinian teen-ager was electrocuted while trying to hang a flag 
on a power line. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli observers speak of Defense Minister Moshe Arens' preference for the 
carrot rather than the stick. Publicly, Arens wants to encourage Palestinians 
to get on with their lives and leave the revolt behind. He is talking with 
traditional groups of "notables" from the West Bank and Gaza, urging them to 
accept Israeli terms for self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
Arens is also toying with new kinds of punishment that might deter stone 
throwing and avoid splashy headlines. Among them is banishing rebels from their 
home towns to other areas and relocating schools from the main roads. The army 
is recommending that jails be expanded and that the parents of stone throwers 
be fined. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, the very presence of soldiers seems to sharply boost the 
likelihood that violence and injury will occur. After several weeks of calm, 
the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Rafah erupted in violence Friday when soldiers 
began patrols after a long absence. Thirty Palestinians were wounded by army 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian analysts suggest that the changing Israeli strategy 
reflects the changed political views of the government. Under the previous 
coalition government, the Defense Ministry was under the control of Yitzhak 
Rabin, whose Labor Party favored giving up at least some of the West Bank and 
Gaza in return for peace. To ensure that the government would be in a strong 
position to make such a concession, Rabin maintained strong pressure on the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The Likud Party of Shamir and Arens rejects the land-for-peace formula. The 
Likud government, analysts say, believes it is more important to keep the 
uprising out of the news, to avoid offending Washington and to avoid building 
up pressure for talks it has no intention of entering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The intifada began inauspiciously enough, just another incident in a long 
string of violent incidents in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. On Dec. 
9, 1987, an Israeli driving a large truck rammed a van carrying Arab workers 
from the Gaza Strip to jobs in Israel. Four Arabs died. The rumor spread 
rapidly throughout Gaza that the crash had been an act of retaliation for the 
murder of an Israeli shopkeeper in Gaza days before. Arabs began throwing 
stones at Israeli cars and passers-by.

COULD VOTERS REJECT A LONG VACATION?; 
</P>
<P>
WORKERS' RIGHTS: A LAWYER IS TRYING TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT AN INITIATIVE 
GIVING EMPLOYEES A SIX-WEEK HOLIDAY. THE PROPOSAL IS TIED TO SOCIAL REFORMS. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like most Americans, Richard Such, 48, has always had to make do with only two 
or three weeks of vacation each year. 
</P>
<P>
But while sitting on a beach in the Yucatan last fall, the San Francisco lawyer 
decided to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
He whipped out the tools of his trade -- a pen and a yellow pad -- and wrote a 
ballot measure that would give most California workers the constitutional right 
to six weeks off with pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have done it sooner," he quipped, "but I have to work all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Such, who is now trying to raise money to print and circulate petitions for the 
initiative, needs the signatures of 675,000 registered voters to qualify it for 
the ballot. He said he does not believe he can get the signatures before 1991, 
at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Such said he drew his inspiration for the proposed constitutional amendment 
from news reports about Western Europe, where many workers have gotten four- to 
six-week vacations for years. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seemed like a basic worker's right that we ought to have," he said in 
a recent interview. "After all, our economy is just as advanced as theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Such took two days of vacation from his work at the First District Appellate 
Project, where he supervises lawyers who handle appeals for indigent Bay Area 
criminals, to write the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating complaints from employers that the initiative would force them to 
reward marginally effective workers, Such devised eligibility conditions that 
"offer workers a choice between . . . enjoying a six-week vacation and . . . 
maintaining lifestyles which are obstacles to efficiency on the job." 
</P>
<P>
He also had in mind certain social reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Here is what he came up with. To qualify for six weeks off under the "Such 
Effective Worker Scheme," an employee would have to: 
</P>
<P>
* Have worked for the same employer for two years. "That is only fair to the 
employer," Such said. 
</P>
<P>
* Have voted in the last election, on the theory that participants in the 
democratic process make more concerned workers. "Of course," Such acknowledged, 
"some workers can't vote because they aren't citizens. This condition will 
encourage them to overcome personal barriers to citizenship -- such as 
difficulty with English -- and that will make them better workers." 
</P>
<P>
* Have a high school education. Such said he wanted to encourage workers who 
have not graduated to go back to school to get a degree, and to discourage 
teen-agers from dropping out of school. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, newcomers to the work force would have to have graduated from a 
public high school to counteract "the present tendency of affluent families to 
give up on the public schools." 
</P>
<P>
To qualify, an employee would have to have used fewer than 10 paid sick days in 
the preceding year, and have refrained from smoking on the job and from abusing 
drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Workers who were convicted of drug possession or driving under the influence 
would lose their right to six-week vacations for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Government workers would be excluded from the long vacations -- a step that 
Such, a former public defender, took reluctantly to avoid charges that his 
proposed initiative would be too costly to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, private employees who met all but one of the requirements could be 
eligible for longer vacations if they agreed to a "bonus" condition: agreeing 
to commute by car pool, public transportation, bicycle or motorcycle to their 
workplaces, or working within 10 miles of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Whether six-week vacations would be too costly is a matter of dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The state legislative analyst, who has reviewed the initiative at the request 
of the attorney general's office, concluded that it would "substantially 
increase" costs to most businesses, and, by reducing their net income, lead to 
a "probably significant reduction in state tax revenues." 
</P>
<P>
But Such disagrees. He concedes that "a worker who works 46 weeks, instead of 
49, might produce less," but argues that most workers would become more 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said he was 
unfamiliar with the initiative and wondered if it was being seriously proposed. 
He said he had never heard of one "more likely to be opposed" by the chamber's 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it'll be taken seriously by very many people," he said. "The 
employers of this state are most eager to be competitive." If they thought 
longer vacations would improve their businesses, he said, they would be 
offering them now.

WILSON BLASTS FEINSTEIN FOR 'FLIP-FLOPS'; 
</P>
<P>
CONVENTION: HE TELLS GOP SHE WAFFLED ON THE DEATH PENALTY, ETHICS AND PARENTAL 
LEAVE. HER MANAGER DISPUTES ACCUSATIONS.

<P>
Moving to solidify his standing within his own party and hoping to attract any 
waffling emocrats, Pete Wilson lambasted Dianne Feinstein on Saturday as an 
architect of "election year flip-flops" who had adopted positions to pander to 
the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican senator and gubernatorial candidate, addressing delegates at the 
semiannual state GOP convention, accused Feinstein of three specific changes of 
heart involving 1990 campaign issues -- the death penalty, ethics and parental 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
To ringing applause, Wilson swiped a line Feinstein had used against her 
primary foe, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
"California deserves better than a governor who, in an election year, turns 
against what she is for and for what she is against," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's campaign manager Bill Carrick immediately denounced Wilson's 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
"The three issues are essentially bogus issues," Carrick said. "Of much more 
concern to Californians is that the senator is the biggest recipient of S&amp;L 
contributions. The campaign is going to be waged on those grounds." 
</P>
<P>
Carrick was referring to a recent study by Common Cause that showed Wilson had 
received more campaign donations from officials of the scandal-plagued savings 
and loan industry than any other senator. Wilson angrily disputed the study, 
saying it was guilt by association and that he had also raised proportionally 
more money than other senators from all sources, limiting the impact of the 
savings and loan contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Though Wilson was the star attraction here, it was Democratic nominee Feinstein 
who commandeered much of the attention. As delegates began to gather Friday 
afternoon, a host of prominent Republicans began a drum roll of criticism of 
Feinstein, particularly highlighting her intention to appoint women and 
minorities to state jobs in parity with the population. 
</P>
<P>
That recurrent theme, and Wilson's later attempts to portray Feinstein as a 
waffling candidate, spoke to Republican concerns that Feinstein is poised to 
skim off GOP votes, particularly those of women. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid raising an issue of particular sensitivity to women, GOP leaders here 
also tried to shunt aside discussion of the divisive topic of abortion. 
Ironically, it arose anyway with word Friday night of Associate Supreme Court 
Justice William Brennan's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has described himself as an abortion rights advocate, a position that 
puts him at odds with President Bush, who will select the next justice. Bush is 
under severe pressure from both sides of the abortion dilemma about his 
replacement for Brennan, who was the liberal leader on issues like abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after his speech Saturday, the senator would not say who 
he favors for the Supreme Court post, other than to say that it should be 
someone who will "apply the law as it is written and not substitute his or her 
own values for the written law." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed as to his druthers, Wilson said he would "probably" feel more 
comfortable with a judge adhering to Wilson's own positions. But he added that 
it would be "unseemly" to try to determine the appointee's personal positions 
on abortion before deciding whether to support him or her. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's speech, as can be expected at a party convention, was highly partisan. 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's name was mentioned -- derogatorily -- 14 times. 
Former California Chief Justice Rose Bird earned Wilson's enmity 16 times. 
Democratic Party Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr. was mentioned nine times. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Wilson asserted that if Feinstein won the governorship, Assembly 
Speaker Brown would "exert more power and be a lot more of a governor in fact 
than Jerry Brown ever was." 
</P>
<P>
As far as the alleged flip-flops were concerned, Wilson cited past Feinstein 
reservations about the death penalty, which Feinstein has said she opposed 
until 1973. Wilson charged that Feinstein in past years has not worked to 
uphold the death penalty at the state or federal level. 
</P>
<P>
"All she sought to change was her position so she could join the people of 
California who had voted twice for the death penalty by 70% margins," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On parental leave, Wilson said Feinstein's current support for a federal bill 
giving leave to new parents ran counter to a 1984 Feinstein quote that 
employers should not have to accommodate themselves to women having children. 
Feinstein's primary opponent, Van de Kamp, tried unsuccessfully to use that 
issue earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein aides, then and now, said that Feinstein had issued a clarification 
the day after her remarks appeared in a wire service story. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also accused Feinstein of changing her tune on ethics reform, saying 
that although she opposed a particular ethics plan in 1986, she now supports 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson himself has been accused of changing sides, most recently by supporting 
a bill requiring minors seeking abortions to have the consent of their parents. 
He has also changed his mind over time on the issue of criminalization of 
marijuana, which he now supports. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's charge against Feinstein was opened by Secretary of Labor Elizabeth 
Dole, who sharply disputed the notion that women would gravitate toward 
Feinstein in the general election as Democratic women did in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dole: "No one can put us in a box and call us 'hers' "

A black man hit by a truck after he was chased into a street by a group of 
whites remained in critical condition Saturday as police who patrol the mostly 
white neighborhood played down similarities with a 1986 clash in New York's 
Howard Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Jennings sustained severe head and chest injuries. He was walking with 
his white girlfriend in the mostly white neighborhood when a truck driver 
yelled at him, provoking three white pedestrians to join in with racial slurs 
and chase him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident resembled one in Howard Beach in which a mob of whites chased a 
black man to his death on a busy highway.

Cuban police sealed off the Canadian and West German embassies in Havana on 
Saturday and tightened a security cordon around the Spanish Embassy after nine 
more Cubans slipped through during the night and broke in. 
</P>
<P>
The latest arrivals brought to 18 the number of Cubans sheltering at the 
Spanish Embassy, further complicating a bitter diplomatic quarrel over the 
refugees that has seriously strained relations between Madrid and Havana. 
</P>
<P>
Another four Cubans are at the residence of the Italian ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
Fidel Castro's Communist government has been insisting that all asylum-seekers 
surrender to Cuban authorities without condition. The government has called all 
those who have gone into the Spanish, Czechoslovak and Italian embassies and 
diplomatic residences in recent days "scum" and habitual vagrants.

BALTICS MARK 'DAY OF TRAGEDY': ABSORPTION INTO SOVIET UNION

The Baltic republics on Saturday quietly marked what Lithuania called "a day of 
injury, humiliation and tragedy," the 50th anniversary of the absorption of the 
republics into the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Flags flew at half-staff in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, and Latvia 
announced that its lawmakers had voted to nullify the 1940 declaration of 
Soviet power. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, July 21 had been celebrated as an official holiday in Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania. But the three Baltic republics in the last year have 
expanded their sovereignty and announced their intention to break with the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's prime minister was quoted Saturday as saying that negotiations with 
Soviet officials on the republic's March 11 declaration of independence could 
start this week. 
</P>
<P>
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were independent of Moscow briefly between the 
two world wars. But under a secret agreement signed by Kremlin dictator Josef 
Stalin and Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler in 1939, they fell into the Soviet 
sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet soldiers moved in as Nazi forces attacked Poland, and under Soviet 
pressure the parliaments of the three republics voted to join the Soviet Union. 
They were admitted as Soviet republics in early August, 1940. Thousands of 
Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians were killed or sent into exile or prison. 
</P>
<P>
The Latvian Supreme Soviet voted Thursday to void the 50-year-old declaration 
of Soviet power, Aris Yansons, an assistant to Latvian President Anatoly 
Gorbunov, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The proclamation strengthened the Parliament's condemnation of the act in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's government said in a statement Saturday that "the 21st of July 
remains a day of injury, humiliation and tragedy in our memory." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's main newspapers carried articles Saturday backing the 
Kremlin position by depicting the Baltics' absorption into the country as 
voluntary and calling for "responsibility and common sense."

ETHIOPIA JEWS POSE ISRAEL DILEMMA; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: NATION MUST WEIGH CONTINUING TO SUPPLY SHAKY MENGISTU REGIME WITH 
ARMS OR RISK A CUTOFF OF REFUGEES.

<P>
A bloody conflict in Ethiopia is presenting Israel with a dilemma: whether to 
continue to supply arms to the battered Marxist government of Mengistu Haile 
Mariam and keep the flow of black Jewish immigrants open, or cut off the 
weapons and risk a bottleneck in Addis Ababa, Foreign Ministry officials here 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is complicated further by the sinking fortunes of the Communist 
government in Ethiopia. Eritrean rebels from breakaway regions along the Red 
Sea coast have made gains in their battle against the central government. By 
continuing to supply Ethiopia with arms, Israel risks alienating the possibly 
triumphant rebels, who also have hundreds of potential Jewish immigrants under 
their control. 
</P>
<P>
This week, thousands of potential immigrants have been reportedly lined up in 
front of the Israeli Embassy in Addis Ababa awaiting visas. No visas had been 
issued for the last week, and it is not clear whether the holdup had to do with 
bilateral disagreements or difficulties in discovering whether all the refugees 
are actually Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry sources say that there is some concern that many of 
the Ethiopians seeking to migrate to Israel may not be Jews but Christians who 
are trying to flee the nation's turmoil and hunger. 
</P>
<P>
The full nature of Israel's diplomatic relations with Ethiopia, which were 
re-established earlier this year after a 13-year break, have been shrouded in 
secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has denied supplying Ethiopia 
with cluster bombs -- deadly weapons that explode in midair and shower the 
ground with explosive pellets. But reports persist that Israel has become a 
major supplier of weaponry to the Marxists in what some Israelis quietly 
characterize as an arms-for-immigrants deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main interest in Ethiopia is to get the Jews out," said a Foreign Ministry 
official. "All else is secondary." 
</P>
<P>
There have been conflicting reports about whether Ethiopia has already decided 
to cut the flow of Jewish refugees to Israel. Mengistu, the Ethiopian leader, 
paid a secret visit to Israel early this month when the weapons and immigrant 
issues were discussed, Foreign Ministry sources confirm. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics printed in Israeli newspapers last week, about 3,000 
Ethiopians have arrived in Israel on refugee flights so far this year, with 
about 400 arriving in June alone. Between 12,000 and 15,000 more Ethiopian Jews 
reportedly remain in Ethiopia and, the Jerusalem Post reported, about 2,000 of 
those live in areas under rebel control. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's backing for the Marxist government drew the ire of Washington, which 
had long pressed for the expulsion of troops from Cuba that shored up the 
regime. Israel, in a pattern it has established in such far-flung countries as 
Guatemala and China, stepped in with weapons unavailable from the West. 
</P>
<P>
Although Israel gives priority to extracting Ethiopian Jews in its relations 
with Ethiopia, analysts here have pointed out that the arms program reaffirms a 
longtime policy of Israel to build alliances on the periphery of the Arab 
world. 
</P>
<P>
At different times, Israel joined with Iran, a Muslim but not Arabic country, 
to aid breakaway Kurdish rebels in Arab Iraq. In southern Sudan, Israel dropped 
weapons by air to Christian rebels. In Uganda, Israeli secret agents helped 
former dictator Idi Amin depose President Milton Obote. In Lebanon, Israel 
supported Christian Maronite factions in the country's long-running civil war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
In one of its most celebrated undertakings, Israel in 1984 brought out about 
12,000 Ethiopian Jews in a secret airlift that came to be known as Operation 
Moses. Ethiopia halted the operation after it became known in January, 1985, 
leaving many families divided. It was not resumed until Israel and Ethiopia 
resumed diplomatic relations nearly five years later.

SALVADOR PEACE HOPES SEEN AS WISHFUL THINKING; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: KEY OBSTACLE IS REBEL INSISTENCE THAT 200 ARMY OFFICERS BE 
PUNISHED FOR CRIMES. GUERRILLAS ARE EXPECTED TO SEEK POLITICAL CONTROL IN THEIR 
STRONGHOLDS.

<P>
Despite optimistic reports of progress in the peace talks between the 
Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, hopes 
for a negotiated end to the 10-year-old civil war seem to be based not so much 
on the evidence as on wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
This is the view expressed by government officials, military figures, diplomats 
and sources close to the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
The insurmountable obstacle, as they see it, is the rebel FMLN's insistence 
that the army dismiss and punish as many as 200 officers for human rights 
abuses and war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"If the guerrillas put forth a list of 200 guys for removal, it just won't 
happen," a Western diplomat with close contacts to the government and the 
military said the other day. "There will be absolutely no sweeping removal of 
officers or trials." 
</P>
<P>
This hard-line view was echoed by a military source who said, "Even if there 
are some corrupt or bad officers, no one can expect the institution to accept a 
purge list from the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
The best that could happen, diplomats and government sources say, is the 
gradual removal of some of the officers identified by the FMLN, but 
unofficially and without a schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"A year from now," the diplomat said, "the most notorious bad eggs will be 
gone. . . . I think there is a corps of officers seen as corrupt, abusers, 
etc., the majority of whom will be gone before an agreement is reached. The 
government won't want to be seen as giving in to the guerrilla demands." 
</P>
<P>
While this may appear to be a reasonable response, not even those who say it 
could happen believe that it will be acceptable to the rebels, even though they 
have backed steadily away from their original demands of political 
power-sharing and the dismantling of the entire military structure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not assured that the guerrillas will accept what they can get in these 
talks," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
An associate added, "After 10 years of fighting and thinking they can win or 
transform the society, I don't see them accepting an agreement that only gives 
them the right to take part in politics." 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the rebels agreed, and said it is particularly true if they 
perceive that the government is not serious about full political participation. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance," one source said, "the guerrillas want basically to take full 
political control of the area where they are strongest (about a third of the 
country). That means they don't want any military or central government 
presence. That way they can build an organizing base for quick electoral 
victories and later expansion." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials and some military officers say this is unacceptable, and 
Washington has made it clear that it will not provide any development or 
economic aid to areas from which the government is excluded. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FMLN has indicated that political participation is now a major 
goal, the issue of military reform is the controlling factor with the guerrilla 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
This view was stated most forcefully by Schafik Jorge Handal, one of the top 
five FMLN commanders, in a radio debate earlier this month. The guerrilla 
movement, he said, "will not sign a pact ending the hostilities while the army 
continues giving refuge to the beasts who ordered the blood bath in El 
Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
A Latin American diplomat who is privy to FMLN thinking said: "This is not just 
boasting or something for effect in the talks. The commanders think they have 
given up more than enough." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the rebels think the United States should support them 
since the U.S. Embassy here has said repeatedly, although not publicly, that it 
wants to see military reform and the removal of the same officers targeted by 
the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials deny any commonality of interests with the rebels. They say that 
although some officers have abused their positions, it is unrealistic to expect 
what the FMLN is demanding. 
</P>
<P>
These officials point out that it has been more than a year since reports 
surfaced that officers to whom the embassy objected would be removed, but that 
with few exceptions nothing has happened, even though the civilian president, 
Alfredo Cristiani, supposedly agreed with the American position. 
</P>
<P>
The optimism developed after the second round of peace talks ended in late 
June, in Mexico City, and has been fed by reports that the army is willing to 
give way on other rebel demands in the peace talks that were resumed Friday in 
Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
The army, besides indicating a vague willingness to permit the FMLN full 
political participation, including organizing unions and similar support 
groups, is also leaking reports of agreement in theory to proposals to separate 
the nation's various police forces from military control and to reduce the army 
from its current force level of 57,000 men. 
</P>
<P>
"What is going on here," a Salvadoran political expert said, "is a developing 
momentum that is slowly reducing the FMLN's options as the government makes 
concessions that really don't touch on the final issue, which is the role the 
military will actually have if the war ends. Some people say this is the way 
negotiations work as one side or the other takes advantage of its strength and 
tries to protect its weakness. I think on the government side it is more a 
question of deception masking a belief that if the rebels won't give in in the 
talks, they can be defeated militarily." 
</P>
<P>
No government official will publicly acknowledge that he believes this, but 
European diplomats said that some officials, particularly some army leaders, 
have indicated in private that they think the guerrillas were so badly hurt in 
last November's offensive that they can no longer mount a serious military 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Many diplomats agree that the rebels are going to be faced with an unpleasant 
choice: accept a peace that does not meet their most basic demand or resume a 
war that has not achieved anything resembling military success or political 
power. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say they are not assuming that the guerrillas are beaten. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the ability to fight, to cause damage for a long time," one said. 
"But as time goes on, events are leading to a precluding of options." 
</P>
<P>
"If that is what they believe," a source close to the guerrillas said, "they 
are probably right, but that shouldn't lead to the conclusion that the FMLN 
will give in. In fact, just the opposite. If you remove all their options 
except surrender, they won't."

Gov. James J. Florio signed into law a package of bills designed to combat 
water pollution and which would penalize violators by up to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
He signed the six bills at the Elizabeth Marina on the Arthur Kill, a shipping 
channel separating New Jersey from New York City. More than 1 million gallons 
of oil have spilled into the Arthur Kill and nearby Kill Van Kull this year. 
The new laws take effect over the next two years.

A man who bought 15 Texas savings and loans using only $1,000 of his own money 
and $70 million in loans also bought an Oklahoma bank at a good price despite 
failing to disclose he'd been indicted for securities fraud, the New York Times 
said in its Sunday editions. James M. Fail was able to buy the United Oklahoma 
Bank, later renamed the Oklahoma Bank, without filling out a required form, the 
paper said. The Phoenix man bought the bank and its approximately $100-million 
worth of assets for $500,000, which he borrowed, according to the Times.

PACIFIC RIM PROGRAM CHANGES TO KEEP UP WITH WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a new $8.8-million building overlooking the Pacific and a complement of 
almost 40 full-time and visiting professors, the University of California's 
grand experiment to prepare students for the economic and cultural challenges 
from Pacific Rim nations has moved into a critical stage. 
</P>
<P>
As the question of America's competitiveness in the world becomes a central 
national theme, the Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific 
Studies at UC San Diego sees itself playing a central role in shaping the U.S. 
response. 
</P>
<P>
The school, with a highly regarded group of academics, an unusually strong and 
diverse group of students, and a curriculum unlike any other at American 
universities, has already established its credibility for preparing students to 
address deficiencies in the policy-making skills of public and private 
institutions concerning Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
But its senior professors say the breakneck pace of change in worldwide 
economic and political events, on top of the growing pains inevitable at any 
new professional school -- let alone one with such a new and ambitious agenda 
-- are forcing continuing refinements and revisions. 
</P>
<P>
As it prepares to welcome its fourth class of graduate students in September, 
the school is altering the curriculum to respond to changing business needs, 
working to improve student job placements and seeking to recruit bright young 
professors to deepen the school's intellectual depth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're operating within a (world) situation of great flux," said Peter 
Gourevich, UCSD professor of political science and dean of the school. "We're 
still asking ourselves what does it take to prepare people for a rapidly 
changing American role in this new international environment?" 
</P>
<P>
Professor Chalmers Johnson, a longtime expert on Japan and China recruited from 
UC Berkeley, punctuated that assessment with reference to the 
multi-disciplinary needs of students for political, economic, historical and 
linguistic preparation. 
</P>
<P>
From an initial number of 30 students in September, 1987, the school has grown 
to 150 today, with a total of 400 expected by mid-decade. Most study a two-year 
syllabus leading to a master's degree in Pacific international affairs, with a 
handful pursuing doctoral degrees in the subject. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds specialize in Asia, with one-third concentrating on Latin 
America in their second year after a rigorous year of interdisciplinary core 
studies. More students plan careers in the corporate sector, as opposed to 
public policy/government positions, than originally anticipated by school 
planners. 
</P>
<P>
"The language requirement has been tough," said Megan DeJarlais, one of seven 
students spending the summer between her first and second year taking intensive 
Japanese to sharpen skills before taking the school's dreaded language 
proficiency exam. 
</P>
<P>
Placement of the students after graduation is critical to the school's eventual 
acceptance as a major academic institution, and the picture has been mixed with 
the first two graduating classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are putting more energy into career preparation, from the first week of 
orientation, to stress that they need to think about their goals, what job they 
want, how to put together a resume, how to interview," Gourevich said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, students have been placed in the private sector more easily than in 
government or foundation positions.

<P>
JAPANESE-AMERICANS: PAINFUL AND PLEASANT MEMORIES MINGLE AT REUNION OF 
INTERNEES AT RELOCATION CAMP IN ARKANSAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERNICE HIRABAYASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surrounded by photographs depicting life in a World War II relocation camp in 
Arkansas, Richard (Choo-choo) Tsujimoto and Marshall Sumida, both former 
internees, came face to face for the first time in 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of talking about how hard camp life was, they only talked about the 
happy memories they shared together during the war years. 
</P>
<P>
"You tend to block out the bitter memories," Tsujimoto, 65, said while a slide 
show chronicled the internment of 120,000 Japanese-Americans and Japanese 
immigrants. "I mostly recall the good times that I had. I came here to see old 
friends for the last time before I pass on." 
</P>
<P>
Tsujimoto and Sumida, 69, were two of more than 1,200 Japanese-Americans who 
converged on the Stouffer Concourse Hotel near Los Angeles International 
Airport this weekend for the first reunion of internees from the Rohwer 
relocation camp. 
</P>
<P>
The event is believed to be the largest of its type ever held. 
</P>
<P>
Guests came from as far away as Chicago and Japan to see old friends, many for 
the first time since the camp disbanded in 1945. They played in a golf 
tournament Friday and jitterbugged to big band music until late that night. On 
Saturday, they viewed a photo and slide exhibit and attended a banquet honoring 
41 of the surviving first-generation Japanese interned at Rohwer. 
</P>
<P>
Some who passed through the exhibit were quiet and thoughtful, searching a 
large map of Rohwer to find buildings in which they lived. Others pointed out 
faces in the photos, joking about how much more hair they used to have, or 
fending off jokes about how they had aged. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Katsuki, 67, chairman of the Rohwer First Reunion Committee, said he 
expected fewer than 400 people to attend. When a reunion ad appeared in a local 
paper and hundreds of ticket orders were placed, it became obvious he had 
underestimated the response. Katsuki canceled the facilities he had booked and 
found a banquet room that would hold more than a thousand people. The 1,200 
seats sold quickly and Katsuki had to start turning people away. Many said they 
would come anyway, banquet or no banquet. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 Japanese from California were interned from 1942-45 at Rohwer 
relocation camp, in southeast Arkansas, one of 10 camps nationwide. When the 
war was nearing its end, Jerome, a neighboring camp, closed and its residents 
were sent to Rohwer. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the internees at Rohwer came from Stockton and Lodi and the other 
half came from Los Angeles County. The majority of camp prisoners were 
high-school aged, said Brian Niiya, a staff member of the Japanese American 
National Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Honda, who has covered scores of veterans' and internees' reunions as 
senior editor of Pacific Citizen, a national publication on Asian issues, said 
the Los Angeles reunion is the largest reunion ever. 
</P>
<P>
The event was filled with nostalgia, poignant moments and some bitter memories. 
</P>
<P>
During Friday night's party, a man took Katsuki's hand, looked into his eyes 
and asked, "Nick? Nick?" 
</P>
<P>
After a pause, Katsuki recognized his former soccer teammate. "Oh, Bangle Boy! 
How 'ya doing?" 
</P>
<P>
The incident was repeated a hundred times throughout the ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been 45 years," said Alice Kajiwa, 62, "but when you start talking to 
people, you feel like you're 17 again. When you first see them, they look old, 
but after you start talking to them, you can see the same young face again." 
</P>
<P>
Hiro Ige clutched a list of about 60 names of people he wanted to see. He said 
the names were of neighbors, schoolmates and sports teammates. Half of the list 
had been checked off. 
</P>
<P>
Kajiwa and Ige said they still feel bitter about the internment. 
</P>
<P>
Ige remembered stuffing burlap sacks with straw to make beds at a temporary 
interment camp at the Santa Anita race track before being relocated to Rohwer. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was so disappointed that we had to live in a horse stable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kajiwa said the government apology offered in 1988 was not a voluntary gesture, 
but was a political response to efforts by Japanese-American politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't really mean it," she said. "They'd like to do it again if they 
could." 
</P>
<P>
Others seemed more willing to put the bad memories behind them. "What's done is 
done," said Susie Oshita. "There's no turning back. I'm just happy to see 
everybody again. This may be my last trip." 
</P>
<P>
Camp reunions started becoming commonplace about 10 years ago, as the redress 
movement, an effort to get Congress to compensate internees, gained momentum, 
said Niiya. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Wong, a visiting scholar at UCLA who is conducting a study of Rohwer 
internees, noted that terms like "concentration camps" and "prisoners" are much 
more frequently used now instead of "relocation camps" and "residents," 
demonstrating a growing acceptance of the reality of the internment. 
</P>
<P>
Kango Kunitsugu, who put the exhibit together, said he wanted the reunion to be 
more than just a fun event. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, the reunion is like getting everything out of your system. You never 
talked about the internment. This reunion is a way of letting off steam and 
releasing yourself of the experiences and hang-ups from the evacuation." 
</P>
<P>
Sumida's brother, Tetsu, said: "As we grew older, we started to understand the 
enormity of what happened. Back then, we were just doing our duty by complying. 
The interesting thing is, our children have been really raising hell with us." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Tsujimoto. "They'd say, 'Why did you go?' " 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the event will go toward restoring two stone monuments in a 
cemetery at Rohwer. One monument is dedicated to men from Rohwer camp killed 
while serving in the U.S. Army. The other was for people who died in the camp.

8 CHILDREN AMONG 11 INJURED IN COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven people were injured, including eight children, when a car and a station 
wagon collided Saturday evening at the busy intersection of Rosecrans Avenue 
and Figueroa Street in Los Angeles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the adults were critically injured and one was listed in serious 
condition, city fire officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
All of the children were hospitalized but with only minor injuries, Los Angeles 
City Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
Names of the injured were not released. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred at 6:45 p.m. as a station wagon traveling southbound on 
Figueroa Street collided with a car turning west onto Rosecrans Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police said at least seven children were traveling in the station wagon, all 
apparently of preschool age. None appeared to be wearing seatbelts or riding in 
protective car seats. 
</P>
<P>
Five rescue ambulances and two fire units responded to the crash and victims 
were rushed to Harbor-UCLA and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew medical centers.

HIGHLAND PARK WOMAN SETS HERSELF ON FIRE

<P>
A distraught 35-year-old Highland Park woman set herself ablaze on a 
neighborhood street early Saturday morning, suffering third-degree burns on 90% 
of her body, a Los Angeles police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Horrified neighbors saw Louisa Jiminez of 5514 Marmion Way engulfed in flames 
about 6:15 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor who ran to extinguish the flames with a garden hose told police 
that Jiminez tried to wave him away. 
</P>
<P>
Jiminez, a mother of three young children, was taken to Huntington Memorial 
Hospital in Pasadena and was in critical condition Saturday evening, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. John Johnston said Jiminez was apparently despondent and had asked her 
husband the night before to set her on fire to "purify" her body.

A TOUGH ROAD AHEAD: LIONS TO BE TESTED EARLY

The Loyola Marymount basketball team had better learn to make itself at home on 
the road, because it appears the Lions will be building up frequent flyer miles 
for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
By the time 1991 arrives, the Lions and Coach Paul Westhead will have traveled 
from Maui to Norman, Okla., to Atlanta and Baton Rouge, La., with quick 
in-state trips up to Santa Barbara and Stockton included as well. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, with only one date to be filled, the Lions do not expect to play an 
official home game before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' schedule of 11 consecutive road games, which features several 
attractive matchups, opens at the Maui Classic, where they will play three 
games Nov. 23-25. The eight-team field includes national powers Syracuse and 
Indiana, who are expected to be seeded 1-2. After Thanksgiving, Loyola will 
play in the UC Irvine tournament along with Bradley, Idaho State and the host 
Anteaters on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1. Then it will travel to Westwood Dec. 2 to play 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
During the next two weeks, the Lions travel to UC Santa Barbara and play a home 
exhibition game against Athletes in Action. On Dec. 15, the Lions travel to 
Norman, Okla., for a televised game against the equally run-loving Oklahoma 
Sooners. Then it's on to Louisiana State on Dec. 20 and Georgia Tech on Dec. 22 
-- both teams figure to be in the top 20 -- before returning to California for 
a brief Christmas break. On Dec. 27, the Lions play at at University of the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Seven consecutive home games begin on Dec. 29 when the Lions play St. Joseph's 
of Philadelphia, Westhead's alma mater. On New Year's Eve, Loyola plays LaSalle 
and on Jan. 5, U.S. International visits. Loyola and Oklahoma have set 
virtually every NCAA scoring record against USIU in the past two years. 
Westmont College, the only non-Division I opponent on the schedule, visits in 
the last nonconference tuneup. 
</P>
<P>
West Coast Conference play starts Jan. 11 with the Lions playing Santa Clara. 
Then comes San Diego and Pepperdine. The traditional home-and-away week with 
archrival Pepperdine comes early, at Loyola on Jan. 16 and the Jan. 19 game at 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The season concludes with the WCC tournament, March 2-4, at Santa Clara, where 
the Lions will be shooting for their fourth consecutive tournament title and 
the WCC's automatic berth into the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
At least six of Loyola's games are scheduled to be televised. 
</P>
<P>
A new feature this season in conference play will be men's and women's 
doubleheaders, with the women's game usually preceding the men's game. 
</P>
<P>
It might be the off-season, but Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball Coach Dave 
Yanai is managing to stay busy. Yanai returned from the U.S. Olympic Festival 
in Minneapolis, where he was an assistant for the West team, and this week he's 
scouting summer leagues and tournament games and running his basketball camp at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
Although the West team went 1-3 in Minnesota, its losses were so close that it 
actually had a positive scoring differential. And, Yanai is glad to report, "I 
would say Western basketball is alive and well. I thought we had some very fine 
players, I would say some of the (college) coaches who are getting these 
players are very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai said he enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the Festival camp, which 
allowed players and coaches from all the sports to mingle. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an interesting opportunity to see a variety of other sports and other 
athletes, and see the kind of dedication those other athletes go through to get 
here" he said. "Sometimes we get caught up in our own sports and kind of forget 
the others that are going on. I also enjoyed getting a chance to meet coaches 
from the other sports, informally, in the village and at meals. That's the kind 
of atmosphere they try to create." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai, who is one of the nation's most respected Division II coaches, also 
liked talking basketball with the festival's other coaches. "It's good to have 
a chance to exchange basketball ideas and experiences," he said. "We had a lot 
of nice talks about basketball. We all got along well. It was a nice 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai will be closing in on his 200th career victory when the Toros' season 
opens in the fall, and has high hopes for a strong team thanks to a solid core 
of veterans and a strong recruiting class. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be pretty good if the old coach doesn't screw them up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles can't seem to get enough of recent Loyola Marymount graduate and 
Clipper first-round draft choice Bo Kimble. The County Board of Supervisors 
declared Tuesday "Bo Kimble Day" and presented him with a plaque. 
</P>
<P>
As Kimble watched, the supervisors cited him "not only for his accomplishments 
on the court, but for providing a positive role model for Los Angeles' youth." 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, Loyola Marymount Athletic Director Brian Quinn said that baseball 
Coach Chris Smith had such a good staff, he feared it would be difficult to 
keep it intact. Quinn's premonitions were correct. In the past few weeks, Rick 
Ragazzo took a job scouting for the San Francisco Giants, Bill Geivett is 
expected to take an assistant coaching position at another school and Dave Kato 
has decided to teach school. 
</P>
<P>
That wipes out the coaching staff of Smith, who is hurriedly conducting 
interviews. And the sudden turnover might not be over: Smith, who has led the 
Lions to NCAA regional appearances in his two seasons at Loyola, said that if 
contacted he would consider the head coaching opening at Cal State Fullerton, 
although he said this week he hasn't actively pursued it. "You'd have to be 
interested," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for the Lions was that they came out of last month's pro draft 
unscathed. None of their eligible juniors -- notably outfielders Rick 
Mediavilla and Tim Williams -- left school and none of Smith's top recruits 
signed contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get hurt at all," Smith said. "We saved all our freshmen. We'll 
return seven starters and some guys with pitching experience." 
</P>
<P>
Now he's back recruiting -- a coaching staff.

INTERNAL EXILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIANNE WIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In February, 1989, Marianne Wiggins became, to use a phrase Moscow once favored 
for those it banished to Siberia, an internal exile -- from literary London to 
pastoral Wales. The American-born author of two warmly reviewed books of 
fiction had just published her most ambitious effort yet, the novel "John 
Dollar." But Wiggins was married to the Indian-born novelist Salman Rushdie, 
whose new novel, "The Satanic Verses," had brought an Iranian death sentence 
down on his head. Already emigres, the two writers became true exiles when they 
went into hiding in Wales, that little country so regularly and so wrongly 
counted among the English-speaking peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 The pages that follow were written two months later and may be read as a 
meditation by, on and from an exile. Since then, Wiggins and Rushdie have left 
Wales. Wiggins has returned to London where, still married to Rushdie but no 
longer in hiding with him, she is at work on a historical novel about the Bill 
of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
WE WERE ON the lam in Wales, running through the Black Mountains like unarmed 
smugglers from the righteous with their guns. Everywhere we went, there were 
slate tombstones, upright shadows on the hills. In the towns, there were slate 
houses, plastered-over slate walls with slate roofs. There was darkness, dead 
as coal, behind the windows of the houses. There were ravens in the fields and 
on the roads. English words from a Welsh poet seemed to sit on the horizon like 
an advertisement for the land: "This sad distracted abstract of my woe." 
</P>
<P>
The mountains wore a beard of snow, even as the pussy willows in the valleys 
bloomed. Pussy-willow trees in Wales are called goat willows, I found out, 
because goats like to eat their leaves. Only the male trees, with their yellow 
catkins, are called pussy willows. Where we'd found a hide-out for a while, 
there was a male goat-willow tree in bloom that I looked onto from my window. I 
cut some of its branches for a jar that I placed in the window in the kitchen 
of the house, but then the catkins, turning golden, made me sneeze. I learned 
about the goat name for the tree from a book called "Trees of Britain" that I'd 
found on the bookshelf in the kitchen next to cookbooks and some novels by 
Alistair MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
That's how I knew about the catkins, but I didn't know what catkin meant. I 
looked it up in the dictionary that I always travel with. Anyone who knows me 
knows that I can't spell. I have to keep a dictionary within reach even for 
something as simple as writing a letter. There are times when I can't spell 
sincerely. At home, where we used to live, I had a dictionary in each room. Now 
I have a single one and a good thing, too -- the people who are with us now 
depend on it for Scrabble. A catkin, I can tell you, is an inflorescence. I 
depend on books for meaning. I depend on them for definition. A catkin is a 
thing defined as "a reduced flower of either sex." 
</P>
<P>
Following the definition of catkin in my dictionary, there was the advice: "See 
ament." I didn't feel like seeing ament. Instead, I watched the thaw of snow 
across the tops of the mountains. The Welsh say that when there's snow on the 
mountains, it's an indication there'll be more. I learned that from a book 
about Welsh legends. Eventually I did see ament, and its definition was 
"another word for catkin." Its second definition, ament II, was "Noun. 
Psychiatry. A mentally deficient person." 
</P>
<P>
Next to the houses built of plastered-over slate along the roads, the houses 
with dark windows, there were hedgerows, yews and daffodils. No kitchen gardens 
grew. A kitchen garden -- chamomile, dill, parsley, carrots, rue -- is an 
English affectation; in Wales, the land around a house is purely land, no 
frippery, no spices. The potato did not root in Wales until a century 
post-Raleigh, and even in the middle of the 18th Century at the Aberystwyth 
market, potatoes were as expensive as the local cheese. Oats were what the 
Welsh ate then, in a porridge they called bwdram. Cawl, a vegetable hot pot 
with potatoes and a bit of bacon or a sheep joint added to it, is the 
traditional dish in Wales. Sheep are the common stock. Walking up a hill one 
morning, I found a sheep skull, embedded in the earth beside a corkscrew holly. 
Sheep were everywhere. We laughed sometimes and called the scenery the Big 
Sheep. 
</P>
<P>
On days when it wasn't pelting hail or rain or snowing, on days when they 
allowed me to, I walked and walked, straight up sheer hills, out of anger, up 
over turfy, lichen-strewn terrain punctuated now and then by those 
wind-bleached sheep skulls beached like whelks and by foxholes and those 
twisted holly trees surprising the horizon. Above me at scarifying intervals: 
jump jets, a Harrier's harangue, RAF, unmarked, some of them dark green and 
some of them with red-and-white striped bellies. These were the Hunters, I 
learned. And I learned other things: That a sheep can recognize another sheep 
but can't differentiate between a horse and a human. That a swede is a rutabaga 
and is used for cattle fodder. That sheep eat beetroots and molasses. That 
great tracts of Wales are designated by Great Britain solely for the practice 
of war games. Near where we were hiding, there was a Ministry of Defense 
training camp where paratroopers trained. Young men in green track suits with 
"Combat '89" stenciled on their sweat shirts practiced calisthenics in our 
road, and military Land Rovers outnumbered every other sort of vehicle I saw. 
</P>
<P>
I was afraid I would be recognized. Once a military Land Rover passed me on our 
road and slowed down and stopped and waited, and I took off, changed direction 
and headed back across the meadows. When I told this to the people with whom we 
have to live now, they told me that it wasn't that the person in the Land Rover 
had identified me as the person I am but that he had identified me as a woman. 
The people with whom we have to live now have taught me a few things about an 
all-male camp: For example, they like to look at women. Men do. So I'm told. 
Then once, too, I thought the woman in the health-food store in the market town 
I shopped in had recognized me, owing to the way she stared at me. But the 
people with whom we have to live now told me that she stared at me, most 
likely, because I have an accent. One of the people with whom we have to live 
now asked me, "Say, do you know Neil Schreiber?" No, I said. Who's Neil 
Schreiber? "Chap I know. American. He has an accent just like yours. I thought 
maybe you knew him." But in my village, I was tempted to reply, there are 
two-hundred-million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Another one of the people with whom we have to live now told me that when his 
wife, who's Thai, came to live in England, she thought the sheep were a foreign 
breed of dog. There were so many sheep where we were hiding that 100,000 were 
stolen last year around the town of Brecon. Brecon is a market town. At the 
Brecon market, there are barren cows, fat bulls, fat ewes, fat hoggets, weaned 
calves, breeding cows, bulling heifers, cull bulls, pedigree beef bulls and 
rams. I learned this by reading local papers. While we were in hiding, I read 
the papers like someone on a river, like the colonel in Garcia Marquez's story 
who reads the papers that come on the boat once a week, out-of-date papers from 
elsewhere, who reads every word of them, chronologically, front to back, 
everything, even the ads. 
</P>
<P>
The local paper that I looked forward to the most was published every week on 
Thursdays. Thursdays, then, held definite excitement. The paper cost 24 pence. 
No other journal -- not El Pais or Applausos or The Observer -- was more 
eagerly awaited by me than The Brecon-Radnor Express &amp; Powys County Times, 
16 pages every week. It was through that paper that I learned location, began 
to find out about where I was and who the people were that sometimes passed me 
on the road. I was not allowed to hold a conversation with a stranger. When I 
went into a store one day to buy some coal to fire the stove that heated the 
house where we were hiding, the question "Are you staying in the village?" 
prevented me from ever going back. I was the American -- Americans in those 
parts were few. Why was I there? What was my purpose? 
</P>
<P>
The coal stove in the kitchen was a Bosky. I learned about the different sizes 
of anthracite that one can buy. I learned why many of the sheep are painted 
colors -- blue, magenta, orange, like flash cards on the hills. One color means 
they've lambed; another means the ram has visited. Dafad is the Welsh word 
meaning "sheep," and dyfodol is the Welsh word meaning "future." I know this 
because in Brecon one day I bought a dictionary and a book called "Welsh for 
Learners." 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to find out how the daffodil became a symbol of the Welsh. I knew 
about the leek because a leek is on pound coins. There are three imprints of 
pound coins in Great Britain: One of them is English, one is Scottish, one is 
Welsh. All bear the Queen's profile on one side, although on the English and 
the Scottish coins, her image is much younger-looking than on the Welsh coin. 
The Scottish pound coin has, verso, a thistle set inside a crown. Around the 
edge of the Scottish version, there's the motto Nemo Me Impune Lacessit: "No 
one touches me without unpleasant consequences." On the verso of the English 
one, there's the coat of arms of England and a lot of French -- Honi Soit Qui 
Mal y Pense and Dieu et Mon Droit -- and around the edge of it, there are the 
Latin words Decus et Tutamen. On the Welsh pound coin, there's a fancy leek, 
looking like a fleur-de-lis, with its stem stuck through a crown just like the 
Scottish thistle. Around its edge are etched the words Pleidiol Wyf I'm Gwlad. 
I needed to find out what Pleidiol Wyf I'm Gwlad meant. Its meaning became a 
sort of test, a sort of project for me. 
</P>
<P>
My days were filled with projects: One day I cooked a swede, for instance. It 
seemed to take forever. One day, too, I catalogued the differences among the 
sorts of lichen I had found. One day I tried to learn about the game of rugby. 
I made a project out of watching birds for about a minute every other day, or 
when I saw an interesting, bright-colored one. A nuthatch -- or something blue 
and yellow-breasted -- liked to feed on certain catkins in the tree outside my 
window. And I learned the border-country legend that says one magpie brings you 
rotten luck, but when you see two magpies on the wing together, you're going to 
get a treat. So every time you see a single magpie, you're supposed to say, 
"Where's your mistress, Mr. Magpie?" and the magpie is assumed to answer, "By 
my side, but you can't see her." One day we got a letter from a friend in 
Canada whose 8-year-old daughter wrote that she was working on a project about 
blinking. This was a subject that I filed away for future use. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, I learned that plismon is the Welsh word for "policeman." But 
as for Pleidiol Wyf I'm Gwlad, I was having trouble cracking it. Gwlad, I found 
out, means "country." But the rest, the other words . . . the closest I could 
come to pleidiol was pledio, the verb that means "to plead." In hiding, as I 
was, the signs, the symbols, slogans, took on added meaning: I remembered a 
short story by Paul Bowles in which some Buddhists in (back then) Ceylon ask 
some Western gentlemen whom they encounter on a bus about the meaning of the 
stripes and colors of their ties. What did the stripes and colors signify? Why 
did some men wear ties while others did not? 
</P>
<P>
"Who can believe the story?" "Who can remember?" "What's reasonable these 
days?" These were sample questions from the book called "Welsh for Learners." 
"What's cooking in the oven?" "Who's perfect?" "What's in the soil?" "What's 
better than this?" "Who was collecting stones?" "Who had been crying?" "Which 
ones had failed?" "Who cleaned the edges?" Some sample sentences employing the 
conditional were "We could have purposely deceived them." "I should have taken 
the bitter medicine." "The woman should have suffered it." "They should pay 
half at least." I liked especially the Welsh expression yn eich elfen, which 
means "in your element," elfen meaning "element" but sounding small, manlike 
and mischievous. 
</P>
<P>
I made a project of learning to translate Welsh place names. I'd grown up in 
Pennsylvania never knowing that Bryn Mawr is Welsh for "big hill." I made a 
project of Welsh sounds. Bwl is easier to say when you know that it's the word 
for "bull," when you know that bwcl is the word for "buckle," bwm for "boom," 
bwlb for "bulb," bwrdd sgor, "scoreboard," bwrdd sbring, "trampoline." 
Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch is the longest place 
name on the map. It means "Saint Mary's Church of the pool of the white hazel 
near the rushing whirlpool of Saint Tysylw's Church, near the red cave." What's 
a red cave? I wrote down in my notebook. What makes it red? I kept trying to 
make sense from nothing. What is the name of that bird? I kept thinking to 
myself, What if these are the limits of life, what if this is the all of what 
is? 
</P>
<P>
Once a month, The Brecon-Radnor Express had a page called "W. I. News." "W. 
I.," I found out, stood for Women's Institute. Women's Institute was the name 
of a club, a service club, and hundreds of them were scattered throughout 
Wales. Once a month on the "W. I." page, I could read the reports from the 
clubs in the county -- from Three Cocks and Llanwrtyd and Aberhonddu and Bwlch 
and Defynnog and Garth. "A pleasant half-hour was spent looking at local and 
holiday slides taken by members, which proved to be very interesting. Japan is 
densely populated, but Mrs. Scutt saw no litter and found the people polite and 
friendly. Mrs. Ursula Pumphrey proposed a vote of thanks. . . ." From 
Crickhowell: "The competition, a Valentine verse based on bread, was won by 
Mrs. Freda Jones." From Builth Wells: "The competition 'Most Artistically 
Folded Napkin' was won by Mrs. Dilys Jones." From Penderyn: "The competition 
'The Most Unusual Teapot' was won by Mrs. Cooke." From Llangasty: "Refreshments 
were served and there followed a 'social time,' organized by Mrs. Wendy 
Griffith, during which members had some fun demonstrating how ambidextrous they 
were." From Garth: "The competition was for the longest apple peel." From 
Defynnog: "The competition for the most unusual button was. . . ." From 
Glasbury: "The competition for an unusual pebble was. . . ." From Tretower: 
"Competition winners for the best covered coat-hanger were. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
There was an article one week called "From Sheep to Shells," about a woman in 
the Brecon hills who had decided that her small holding would not provide her 
with a decent living raising sheep, so she had sold them and invested in a 
100-breeder-strong conurbation of land snails, African ones, said to be more 
tender and less rubbery than their North European cousins. It was by reading 
this article that I learned that the African land snail gestates in four months 
as compared to two years for the European species, and that Eastern European 
snails have been contaminated ever since Chernobyl. It was in The Brecon-Radnor 
Express, too, that I read that "a farmer who staggered into a neighbor's house 
half-naked, covered in blue dye, with his hands and testicles bound with rubber 
bands, has been cleared of the charges that he planted a hoax bomb and wasted 
police time. . . . Stephen Gilmore Williams said that he had crossed two fences 
with his hands tied behind his back and his testicles bound in a rubber band, 
but Detective Inspector D. A. Davies of Ammanford had tried to do the same but 
had failed to do so." Talk about your projects. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Only Jesus Saves," I saw one day painted on a railroad bridge when we were 
driving somewhere on the run near Merthyr Tydfil, and the plismon in my company 
remarked, "Not on our bloody pensions, Jesus couldn't." "Wales Is Not for 
Sale," I saw painted on some rocks in the Black Mountains. I learned that there 
had been an increase in the incidence of arson, that Welsh Nationalists were 
setting fire to the summer homes owned by the English. And there was murder, 
too. And racial violence. From The Express, I learned about the findings of an 
inquest -- "Jury Returns Verdict That Youth Who Died in River Plunge Was 
Unlawfully Killed" -- into the death of a 20-year-old boy from Trenewydd, 
Llanfaes, who had fallen 20 feet from the Llanfaes Bridge in Brecon into the 
River Usk the previous December. A Home Office pathologist had found that the 
deceased had died of brain damage resulting from a fractured skull. The doctor 
had discovered no evidence of drowning. The report, which I read in my room at 
my place of hiding, said, "Passing Christ College, the two defendants, who were 
quite merry by then, began singing a Max Boyce song about the English not being 
able to raise a rugby team to beat the Welsh. It was fairly rude, they added." 
Who's Max Boyce? I wrote down in my notebook. It was the 47th item on my list 
of things to find out, learn and do. No. 46 was Try to get a copy to reread Hal 
IV, Part I, re: Owen Glendower. No. 45, crossed out, had been Find out the diff 
betw scree and slag. 
</P>
<P>
"As they were a quarter-way across Llanfaes Bridge, still singing," the article 
continued, "a witness noticed two other youths on the opposite side of the 
bridge who were carrying paper-wrapped portions of fish and chips and eating 
from them. 'Because we thought we might have offended them,' the defendants 
said, 'we shouted, "Are you English?" ' Then all of a sudden, they testified, 
the blond-haired person charged across the bridge and grabbed one of them by 
the collar and was abusive towards him, calling him 'a wanker.' Aware that the 
other person, the deceased, had come across the bridge as well, one of the 
defendants testified, 'Something caught my eye, and I saw him against the 
railings. He flipped over backwards over the bridge. The whole incident 
happened within seconds.' At the outset of his summing up, the coroner told the 
jury what verdicts they could consider appropriate to return. The choices 
facing them, he said, were a) unlawful killing, b) accidental death or death by 
misadventure, and c) an open verdict." "Unlawful killing," the article went on 
to teach me, "means manslaughter or murder." What's an open verdict? I wrote 
down. I looked it up. An open verdict is a finding of death by a coroner's jury 
without stating the cause. Death by unstated causes: Death by death, in other 
words. Marw is the word in Welsh that translates "dead." It sounds like mort 
when spoken. Marwoldeb is the word that means "mortality"; marwol is the word 
for "lethal"; marwor is the word for "cinder, a dead fire." 
</P>
<P>
One night, watching news from elsewhere on the television, I saw the president 
of a bankrupt desert nation speak into a microphone while an English-accented, 
male voice translated his, the president's, intent to send a black arrow of 
revenge from that distant desert into my husband's heart. 
</P>
<P>
We were hiding in a legendary place, a place where legends grew from ground, 
Arthurian, Tolkienate. To learn to write was an ancient Celtic fear, an 
accomplishment charged with retribution and with danger. Caesar, encountering 
the Celts, judged their belief to be that knowledge, rite, wisdom, rune -- 
those who could write of those things held power; those who could write of the 
arcane, of rite and of worship, were people who deserved to be, who must be, 
feared. Hiding one's name, never writing it down, never committing one's name 
into symbol, is still a recurring motif in Welsh legends and stories. It's 
still dangerous to put one's name on paper. 
</P>
<P>
Warplanes fly sideways through the valleys. We wait for one aged psychopath to 
die. We try to study and to learn. Names of things. One legend says that Welsh 
fairies are afraid of iron because the fairies are the lost survivors of a 
tribe of never-aging children whose ancestors fell victim to a race of 
conquerors who conquered them with weapons made of iron. What is the name of 
that bird? What is ink made of? Could I write in blood? What are words made of? 
</P>
<P>
One time, long ago, I wrote a book about adventures on a desert island. Isn't 
that a laugh? Crusoe used to go around his desert island and, as Orlando did, 
Crusoe used to carve his name in trees. Crusoe and Orlando were both fictions. 
They weren't men. Others made them up and wrote them down. Tomorrow, in a book 
called "The Oxford Companion to the Mind," I will read an essay titled "Chinese 
Evidence on the Evolution of Language" so I can learn about the use of 
pictograms. Tomorrow, I will shout at planes and jets that come at us like 
arrows. Tomorrow, I will burn myself on what I take to be a cinder. Tomorrow, I 
will find the picture with the diagram inside the book that tells me finally, 
simply and beyond a doubt -- the way religion tells some things to some people 
-- This tiny thing of beauty in the tree outside your window is a chaffinch, 
Marianne.

THE PICTURE being painted for the future is not a pleasant one: dry, 
sand-colored lawns, prickly underfoot, dead from lack of water. Is this, as 
some experts believe, the inevitable fate of lawns in Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
During this fourth year of drought, with reservoirs drying up throughout the 
state, it is crucial to cut back on the use of water. Lawns, considered by many 
to be the thirstiest element in a garden, certainly seem the logical place to 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty hard to justify that big slab of green when you run out of water," 
says Santa Barbara nurseryman Ray Sodomka. "The lawn is an easy sacrifice, 
compared to trees and shrubs -- or taking a shower." 
</P>
<P>
Sodomka should know; his lawn has been brown for months. In Santa Barbara -- 
where special pumps are being installed in the reservoirs to suck water from 
the very bottoms -- lawns are as dry and crisp as native grasses. Those who 
tried to keep their lawns alive in early summer found in their mailboxes water 
bills for as much as $500, just one penalty for wasteful water use. 
</P>
<P>
So far, in Southern California, Santa Barbara's case is unique. But many people 
believe it's a preview of California's future: To save precious water, some 
say, Californians will simply have to get rid of their lawns. Incredible 
suggestions are being made as water-saving alternatives. Some seem ridiculous, 
such as filling entire front yards with artificial plants and dyeing lawns 
green. Others sound sublime, such as replacing water-needy plants with 
Mediterranean and California natives that can survive almost entirely on 
natural rainfall. There is talk among city and county officials not only of 
limits on how much area around a home can be planted with turf and of 
"official" plant lists that would mandate which plants can and cannot be grown, 
but of outright bans on lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Although only Santa Barbara has banned the watering of lawns, other areas have 
come up with incentives for cutting back of the amount of lawn in a yard. The 
North Marin County Water District, for instance, offers rebates of as much as 
$300 to those who limit their new lawns to 800 square feet or who tear up their 
existing lawns and plant ground covers, or any other plant for that matter, in 
their place. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone believes that dooming the lawn -- our symbol of suburbia and the 
good life -- will solve the water shortage or help the environment. "Whenever 
there is a problem, people are told to kill their lawns," says Beth Rogers, of 
Pacific Sod, who is involved in the newly formed Green Industries Council, a 
group representing nurseries, landscape contractors and designers. "We had a 
federal water officer in Northern California say that the sign of a good 
citizen is a dead lawn. Are lawns and gardens that unimportant?" 
</P>
<P>
California's estimated 1.38 million acres of lawn are thought to use the bulk 
of the water applied to the landscape. Studies done by the North Marin County 
Water District indicate that, at least in that region, lawns soak up about 90% 
of all water used outdoors in suburban areas. But researchers at the University 
of California, Riverside, have given us a new, and more complete, water-use 
breakdown for the entire state: Almost 80% of the water in California is used 
for agriculture, 12% by homes and industries and an additional 4% for 
landscapes -- which sounds like a drop in the bucket. In fact, Rogers and other 
lawn defenders consider this an inequitable distribution of water in a state 
that is rapidly becoming more urban than it is agricultural. "We need to 
protect the garden as a priority water use," says Rogers. "Plants are one of 
the few things that mitigate the urban environment. We don't live in a pristine 
natural environment but in an asphalt jungle. Plants are one of the few things 
that make it habitable; they cool and clean our air, hold down dust and runoff, 
and," she adds, "grass does these things better than most plants." 
</P>
<P>
Victor A. Gibeault, University of California Cooperative Extension 
environmental horticulturist at UC Riverside and an authority on turf grasses 
in Southern California, agrees. In an as-yet-unpublished report on California 
turf grass, he writes: "Turf grasses directly influence our immediate 
environment in many positive ways. Actively growing turf grasses have been 
shown to reduce high summer surface temperatures because of transpirational 
cooling. Turf grasses, often with trees, shrubs and ground covers, reduce 
discomforting glare and traffic noise and increase infiltration of water in the 
soil and the water quality." 
</P>
<P>
The actual amount of water that lawns require is also debatable -- not all 
grasses are created equal. "A lot of the information about lawns is not based 
on fact," says Gibeault. "Ten years ago we had no facts. Now we have some, and 
they show that, in Southern California at least, lawns may not use all that 
much more water than other commonly used plants." 
</P>
<P>
The research he is talking about, carried out at the Southcoast Field Test 
Station in Irvine, shows that some lawn grasses can get by on as little water 
as can Australian saltbush, a plant whose very name suggests its ability to 
survive in hostile environments. Common Bermuda grass and the hybrid Bermuda 
named 'Santa Ana' actually outperformed tough ground covers such as various 
saltbushes, yarrow (frequently suggested as a drought-resistant substitute for 
turf) and the rangy O'Connor's legume (a cultivated clover). 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many lawns in Southern California are planted with cool-season 
grasses such as bluegrass and ryegrass. With shallow roots and almost 
unquenchable thirsts, these are not tough or drought resistant. They do not 
spread, and they do most of their growing in winter and spring. Keeping them 
happy during the California summer is nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Gibeault champions warm-season grasses, which grow in the summer and may be 
dormant in winter. Bermuda grass, sometimes called "devil grass" because it's 
so invasive, is the most common, spreading above ground by ever-growing stems 
and underground by far-reaching roots. It is precisely this aggressive behavior 
that makes warm-season-grass lawns tough, and they are naturally 
drought-resistant -- their roots are strong and deep, their blades narrow and 
water-conserving. 
</P>
<P>
"With the warm-season grasses there's an automatic water savings of 20%. Plus 
these grasses can tolerate periods of drought," says Mike Henry, director of 
the Orange County office of Cooperative Extension. "You can reduce the amount 
of water to a level where they compare with all but the most drought-resistant 
plants." 
</P>
<P>
It takes about 38 inches of irrigation or rain to keep bluegrass alive. 
Research shows that only 18 inches of applied irrigation is necessary each year 
to keep warm-season grasses looking their best, but to be only reasonably 
green, they can survive on a mere six inches of irrigation for the whole year. 
These tests show that warm-season grasses can survive minimal watering and 
temporary drought. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is addressing the issue: Does it really take more water to keep a lawn 
a moderately green, dense cover than it does to keep some of the alternatives 
being suggested alive?" Henry says. "So far, our tests say no." 
</P>
<P>
Henry and others have found that warm-season grasses are in the same water-use 
ballpark as citrus and deciduous fruit trees and most ground covers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not true that lawns are using all the water in the garden and that ground 
covers use 80% less. They're actually quite close. The implication is that you 
can save a lot of water if you tear out your lawn, but to tear out a 
Bermuda-grass lawn and replant it with gazanias is a waste of time and will not 
save water," Henry says. "I'm not an advocate of wall-to-wall turf grass, but 
people should make a decision based on facts before they develop a garden that 
is lawn, coyote brush or pansies." 
</P>
<P>
But it is not Bermuda-grass lawns or the tough new university-developed zoysia 
grass that people are planting. The current favorite is tall fescue, a 
cool-season grass that uses quite a bit of water but looks very good. Sold 
under a variety of brand names, such as Marathon, tall fescues were unheard of 
10 years ago but today account for 80% of all sod sales. Homeowners have taken 
to tall fescues not only because they look more like Eastern lawn grasses and 
do not go dormant in winter but also because they've heard that tall fescues 
are deep-rooted and drought-resistant. Which they are, up to a point. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a better range of drought tolerance and can survive the missed 
watering," says Mike Henry. "But they can't survive on 10 inches of water a 
year like the warm-season grasses." 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, these new tall-fescue lawns look better simply because they are 
new, and owners, careful of their investment, are watering them more often. 
It's quite easy to keep a new lawn looking good for three, five, even 10 years, 
but then the soil becomes compacted, thatch (dead grass and runners) begins to 
build up, water begins to run off, and fertility drops. At that point, no 
amount of water is going to make it look good. A lawn of redone Bermuda grass 
or of newly planted warm-season grass would look as good as a new tall-fescue 
lawn but would require less water. 
</P>
<P>
One thing all experts agree on is that midsummer is not the time to make 
radical changeovers. If you are thinking of uprooting your lawn, or a portion 
of it, wait until the cooler weather in the fall, when new plants need less 
frequent watering to become established. Otherwise, you use more water 
beginning a new garden than you would maintaining an established one. 
</P>
<P>
Even without threats from city governments, some gardeners have already said 
their farewells to front lawns, the least used of lawns. "I got sick and tired 
of pushing a lawn mower for almost 80 years," says Robert A. Mitchell of Los 
Angeles, who tore out an aging Bermuda-grass lawn and replaced it with various 
succulents and ground covers, including gazanias and red-apple ice plant, and 
shrubs. "All that mowing, edging, fertilizing and weeding got to me. But I 
finally did it because I think it's important to save water. I think lawns are 
passe now." His new ground covers are irrigated (with the old lawn sprinklers) 
only once every two weeks; the lawn was watered two or three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks away, Michael Dula and Alison Sowden deep-sixed their lawn because 
"no matter how much we watered our lawn, it was never enough -- it never looked 
good," Dula says. Rather than redo the lawn and its rusty sprinkler system, 
they planted an attractive collection of drought-resistant ground covers, 
perennials and shrubs. "It started out as an ecological thing but turned into a 
hobby," says Dula, who, with his wife, is now tackling the back yard. Now they 
water every three to four weeks and are convinced that the new plantings are 
"definitely a lot less work and more fun." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of gardeners can sympathize with the Dulas -- very few Southern 
California lawns look all that good. Cooperative Extension researchers found 
that there is about three times as much lawn in the Southern California as 
there should be, considering the amount of water used. In other words, most 
people already are underwatering their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
If this doesn't sound right, it could be because lawns in Southern California 
range from lush green expanses (watered every day with automatic systems) in 
Beverly Hills to the half-dead patches in most neighborhoods. The vast 
difference among climates in California also affects how much water it takes to 
keep a lawn healthy -- obviously lawns in Pacific Palisades require less than 
lawns in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all the bad publicity lawns have gotten in the past few years, 
lawnless yards are still the exception to the rule, which seems to be "lots of 
lawn and birch trees," according to Thousand Oaks landscape architect Ken 
Smith. The person who literally wrote the book on water conservation for the 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ("40 Ways to Save Water in Your Yard 
and Garden"), Smith designs dozens of gardens every year. Still he has found 
precious few customers for his water-conscious ideas. "Someone finally asked me 
to do a garden with no lawn. They wanted unusual, drought-resistant plants 
instead. It was real exciting," Smith says. "But most clients still want a more 
traditional garden." 
</P>
<P>
It's true that a broad sweep of lawn defines a "traditional" garden. Developers 
know this, which is why some of the most expansive lawn installations can be 
found in or around new subdivisions and commercial developments. In the rapidly 
growing "new" communities from Lancaster to Temecula, bright green sod is as 
prominent as banners and flags on opening day. "People want a landscape now, 
and sod is an instant solution," explains Smith. "And it does have a lot going 
for it -- you can walk on it almost immediately, it stops erosion, holds down 
dust, prevents weeds, and it is easy and inexpensive to install and maintain." 
Unfortunately, most of the new sod around developments is the tall fescue, not 
the warm-season grasses; sprinklers run endlessly and water pours down the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
But even among developers, there are signs of change. Bob Reed convinced his 
partners to try a lawnless garden in front of one new house in their Riverside 
County tract. "It wasn't easy. All they could think of was cactus and gravel," 
says Reed. Landscape designer John DeForest did use cactus, and gravel, but 
also all kinds of other plants that make the front a fascinating tapestry. "It 
sure looks better than a lawn to my eyes," says Reed. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't just new condo complexes and trendy tracts that commit lawn abuse. 
Lisa Iwata, a San Clemente landscape architect and one of the organizers of the 
annual Southern California Xeriscape Conference, points to lawns that serve no 
purpose as water-wasters -- those around industrial buildings with "Keep Off 
the Grass" signs and lawns in median strips of boulevards. These she calls 
"silly lawns" that should definitely be gotten rid of. 
</P>
<P>
Many homeowners have their own strips of "silly lawn" -- the parkway planting 
between street and sidewalk. Little, narrow strips of lawn like this have been 
outlawed in North Marin County because they are impossible to water 
efficiently. Most city ordinances, however, require that these parkways be 
grass because any other plant would get in the way of an opening car door. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Ismay, primary consultant for Landscape and Water Management 
Consultants in Los Angeles and Laguna Niguel and a strong proponent of 
xeriscape, concurs with Iwata on silly lawns: "What the heck is a lawn doing in 
the middle of the street? Nobody can even walk on it. That's misusing it." 
</P>
<P>
Xeriscape, a term coined by the Denver Water Department in 1980, means water 
conservation through creative landscaping. Says Iwata, "Water-saving gardens 
require more careful thought and planning and initially are more expensive to 
install, but they pay off down the road." Iwata sees xeriscaping as a sensible, 
and necessary, next step for California gardens. "Many think xeriscape means 
you have to get rid of lawns," says Ismay. "Wrong. Xeriscape does not mean no 
more turf; it means we stop abusing and misusing it. Grass is not appropriate 
in the middle of the street. But it certainly is appropriate in parks and in 
play areas -- you can't ask your kids to go play on the coyote brush." That 
tough, drought-resistant, shrubby ground cover would provide an uncomfortable 
play area indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Iwata, in fact, is waiting for autumn's cooler weather to plant a small lawn in 
her own garden so that her 3-year-old has a place to play. Like most of the 
gardens she designs, her own garden is mostly landscaped with native and other 
drought-resistant plants. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think that xeriscape means 'zeroscape,' " she says. "But 
that's not the idea at all. In my garden I have all the plants people think 
they are going to have to give up -- from azaleas to violets, and, in a few 
months, a lawn. But as a whole, the garden uses very little water." 
</P>
<P>
"The ideal xeriscape," Ismay says, "and what we strive for, would use three 
times as many plants while also using less water. The idea is to plant more 
greenery, not less." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those advocating xeriscapes do see lawns as part of the landscape 
picture -- if planted wisely and less frequently. 
</P>
<P>
A key step in solving the lawn-and-water problem is to fine-tune watering and 
irrigation systems. People who water concrete and allow runoff to rush down the 
gutter give lawns a bad name -- concreto no crese ("concrete doesn't grow" in 
Spanish). "Accuracy is the new word in irrigation," says Iwata. "It's extremely 
important to put the right amount in the right place," she says. And help is on 
the way. There are new sprinklers that spray water in a flatter arc, so less is 
scattered to the wind, and that apply it at a lower rate so it can sink in and 
not run off. New automatic timers work in on/off cycles that also give the 
ground time to absorb the water. 
</P>
<P>
Lawn-placement planning can help, too. "It makes no sense to plant lawns in 
narrow areas or on hillsides where it cannot be watered efficiently," says 
Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Efficient watering is well on its way to becoming a science in Southern 
California. Using new calculations, experts can, for the first time, tell us 
how long to water as well. 
</P>
<P>
By measuring evapotranspiration (ET) rates -- how much water a plant loses to 
the atmosphere during any given period of time -- you can gauge more accurately 
how much, and how often, the plant should be watered. The San Bernardino County 
office of the Cooperative Extension has recently published "The Easy Guide to 
Lawn Watering," which makes ET use easy. The booklet uses what's called 
"historical ET" -- the average month-by-month ET rate for a specific area over 
the past 15 years. This information is gathered by California Irrigation 
Management Information System (CIMIS), a statewide system that monitors ET. 
CIMIS was developed for agriculture, but large urban turf users, such as golf 
courses and parks, are beginning to use it as well. Although home gardeners can 
work only with averages (golf courses and large turf installations can actually 
figure out each day's ET rate), they can still water their lawns more 
efficiently. Not all counties have this information available yet; telephone 
your county's Cooperative Extension office. 
</P>
<P>
It is crucial that we begin taking personal, well-informed water-saving steps. 
In an April Los Angeles Times article, Carl Boronkay, the general manager of 
the giant Metropolitan Water District, said, "This drought is focusing 
attention on the fact that things will be different from now on." Since the MWD 
will be supplying most of Southern California with its water, those are words 
to be heeded. 
</P>
<P>
A few good rainy years may postpone any enforced change in lawns and gardens, 
but regulations seem inevitable. It is possible that there will be a vast 
public outcry, that people will decide that lawns are worth the water they 
consume. They also might demand that the state change the way the water pie is 
divided among agriculture and urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
But it is even more likely that before anybody notices, and before all the 
facts are in, cities will pass ordinances that tell us what we can and cannot 
do in our gardens. "Already, they are planning ordinances all over the place 
telling you what you can and can't plant," Iwata says. "It's very scary." 
</P>
<P>
"When regulation by government extends to your own back yard," adds Ken Smith, 
"that's the last straw. Imagine the bureaucrats you will have to deal with to 
get permits to do anything in your garden." 
</P>
<P>
Most people involved with gardening and horticulture hope that we will steer 
the middle course -- that there will be less lawn in the near future but not no 
lawns -- and they hope that other plants will replace our much-loved grass. The 
worst-case scenario, however, is that when confronted with water restrictions, 
most people will take the easy way out and replace living landscape with 
pavement or gravel, which will add nothing to the urban environment. (In fact, 
this is exactly what's happened, with disastrous results, in true desert cities 
such as Phoenix.) 
</P>
<P>
Better gardeners will most likely discover all the new drought-resistant plants 
being introduced at nurseries, and convert more of their gardens to non-turf 
areas. What lawn remains will be more efficiently irrigated and will probably 
look a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect to see the end of the lawn as we know it," Iwata says. "Lawns will be 
smaller, more useful." 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to adjust our expectations," Ismay adds. "Gardens are going to be 
different. Not better, not worse, just different."

Once you've shed your office garb, forget pale solids and civilized stripes. 
This summer, the look in men's after-hours wear is the oversized print shirt. 
</P>

There's nothing traditional here: Bold florals, exaggerated paisleys, dots, 
modern art brush strokes, geometric and abstract patterns, all in rich, earthy 
and contrasted colors that carry through from summer to fall.

"Men used to be peacocks -- now we're at it again," says designer Luke Friedman 
of Cafe, a medium-priced line of men's printed shirts, shorts and pants. He has 
been designing print shirts for a couple of years, but customers were a select 
few. Then suddenly, this summer, men of all ages and occupations, in search of 
more personal expression in their casual wear, began snatching them up. "These 
shirts are an art form," Friedman says. "They make a very personal statement." 
In other words, choosing a shirt is like selecting a painting -- but at a much 
more affordable price.

IRONCLAD

<TEXT>
<P>
VERDIGRIS COPPER was the designer metal of choice in the '80s, but wrought iron 
is fast becoming the most popular material of the '90s. Previously used for 
outdoor furniture and garden decoration, today's ironwork feels comfortable 
inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
Designers and sculptor-blacksmiths hail its versatility: There is almost no end 
to the items that can be cast or wrought. Iron can be polished to a mirror 
finish, soaked to create an instant aged-rust patina or, as with the delicate 
ornamental iron seen here, simply painted. 
</P>
<P>
In this Pacific Palisades residence, Santa Monica-based designer Brian Murphy 
uses painted ironwork throughout the house. The chandeliers, newel post, 
banister, railing, decorative wall hanging, room divider and dining-room table 
have been fashioned from new or recycled materials. Murphy describes the effect 
as that of a Mexican wedding dress: layer upon layer of white, lacy iron. 
</P>
<P>
A master of celebrating the everyday object -- his work has included chairs 
made from old surfboards and wall sconces created from hula skirts -- Murphy 
prefers old, discarded ironwork, much of it found in junk shops or purchased 
from ironmongers. Here, a window transom becomes a chandelier with Tivoli 
lights, and two window grates form a table-top (an aluminum baseball bat 
pinch-hits for one leg; other legs are free-form, hand-wrought steel). 
Ornamental panels from old gates are turned into the stairwell railing, and 
three fan-shaped exterior transom-window grates become an airy room divider and 
wall tapestry. The hands-on craftsman quality of today's ornamental iron, 
coupled with its eminently tactile quality, gives it a contemporary spirit that 
resonates with tradition. Barbara Thornburg

<P>
It must be remembered that in last August's binding agreement between baseball 
commissioner Bart Giamatti and Pete Rose it was never spelled out that Rose bet 
on baseball games, the sin for which he was banished from the game. 
</P>
<P>
He was not accused of it, and his hot denials figured in the daily dairy of the 
case that lingered for six months. Why, then, did Rose agree to accept 
baseball's maximum punishment -- exile forever? Because they were dancing 
around all the implicits of the agreement: that Rose had been caught betting on 
ball games and was getting baseball's life sentence. It was to gain his end 
that Giamatti agreed to make no definite charges, and additionally specified 
that Rose could apply for reinstatement in a year. 
</P>
<P>
It worked. Rose, who recognized the weight of evidence against him, knew he was 
a dead duck, and grasped at the face-saving factor of the right to reapply, 
which would give his case a better light. 
</P>
<P>
But that last condition was merely part of the charades. Fifteen men have been 
barred from baseball, and none was reinstated. After his pact with Rose, 
Giamatti the next day said of Rose, "Yes, I have concluded he bet on baseball 
games, including those of the Reds." 
</P>
<P>
The reapply-in-a-year stuff was put in best perspective by a high source in the 
commissioner's office who said "we won't quibble about the language if Rose is 
agreeing to accept the electric chair." Rose's chances of being reinstated in a 
year, or ever, it must be concluded, are about as rosy as Pete's next five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
That prison sentence he drew for filing false tax returns immediately raised 
the question of Rose's prospect of ever being voted into baseball's Hall of 
Fame, for which he would be eligible in 1992. Is he so tarnished that 
Cooperstown would be diminished by Pete Rose's induction? There are all shades 
of opinion, voiced immediatedly in the newspapers, on television, on talk 
shows, all of which started the Pete Rose thing as an intriguing topic. 
</P>
<P>
The case is made, of course, that Cooperstown is populated by heroes who were 
no models of deportment. Babe Ruth and some others were known to be egregious 
womanizers; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker were accused of betting on ball games 
(they were cleared). But no convicted felon was ever honored with enshrinement 
at Cooperstown. That line against Rose may have been drawn long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has made election to Cooperstown a passion, saying his glorious baseball 
record, including the 4,256 hits that surpassed Cobb's record, should be a 
consideration (some spoilsports would note that it took Rose more than 2,000 
more times at bat than Cobb needed to set the record). But there can be no 
gainsaying what Rose did on the diamond. He was a great ballplayer. The 
opinions on Rose have been coming in from everywhere. Even former president 
Nixon chipped in with the belief that Rose should be in the Hall of Fame, which 
may or may not be a plus; many writers with the ballot would vote against Rose 
now, but say they would be willing to reconsider his case in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
A most poignant opinion was voiced by the Houston Chronicle's Harry Shattuck: 
"I'm still inclined to vote for him because he has Hall of Fame credentials as 
a player. But I hope the good people at Cooperstown put his statue and 
memorabilia in a dark corner of the museum with a sign that says 'Off Limits To 
Children' because he is no role model." 
</P>
<P>
It is to be remembered that the Hall of Fame voting must be based, in a large 
measure, on "a player's integrity, sportsmanship and character." In addition to 
the commissioner's office, Uncle Sam would also be a hostile witness in those 
important matters. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame is for heroes. Pete Rose is no hero. He was a great 
ballplayer, but hardly a person to evoke admiration and appoint to the game's 
highest honor. Who now, would want to elevate Pete Rose? He will not get my 
vote.

JIM MURRAY: FALDO PLAYS SPOILER -- OF GREAT STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. ANDREWS, Scotland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be Dempsey-Tunney. 
</P>
<P>
How about Tyson-Spinks? 
</P>
<P>
It was supposed to be the golf equivalent of a battle of the century, a 
heavyweight championship fight. In this corner, the Great White Shark, 
everybody's favorite, all those teeth and white-on-white hair, the most famous 
peroxide blond since Jean Harlow. Mr. Charisma, the flashy slugger from Down 
Under, the crowd-pleaser, the knockout artist. 
</P>
<P>
In this corner dour, dark, gloomy Nick Faldo, the guy who looks as if just got 
word his house is on fire and his insurance has lapsed. The cautious, 
counter-punching, back-pedaling ring general. Nobody's favorite but a hard man 
to beat, a hard man to lay a glove on. 
</P>
<P>
It was a one-round knockout, as one-sided as a Joe Louis bum-of-the-month tour. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Blah gave Mr. Charisma a lesson in heady, canny, strategic play. He knocked 
him through the ropes, all over the ring. 
</P>
<P>
If it were really a fight, they would have stopped it. At the 13th hole. No 
later. By then, Greg Norman was in no position to defend himself. He was 
glassy-eyed, wobbly, out of it. He looked -- and played -- like a guy looking 
up at the ring clock hoping for the bell. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Faldo spoiled one of the great stories of the year, one of the great 
matchups of golf history. We were looking for Hogan-Snead, Palmer-Nicklaus, 
Jones-Sarazen. We got one of the great mismatches of golf history. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo-Norman were supposed to play the two final rounds of this year's British 
Open toe-to-toe, trading blows, birdie-for-birdie, eagle-for-eagle. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was Secretariat at the Belmont, the Titanic against the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Faldo made Round Four of the 1990 British Open a formality. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be a tournament, it'll be a parade -- a recital by the artist. The 
great confrontation got sidetracked. Norman couldn't really answer the bell by 
the ninth hole. Faldo not only beat him to the punch, he turned him back with 
almost contemptuous ease without even looking concerned. By the time he got 
through, Norman wasn't even in his twosome for today's final round. He got 
shuffled all the way back to a starting time one hour before the leaders. Corey 
Pavin, Tim Simpson and Nick Price stood between Norman and Faldo in the 
pairings, to say nothing of Frank Nobilo, Paul Broadhurst and Craig Parry, all 
of whom shot past Greg. 
</P>
<P>
On a day when someone named Paul Broadhurst could shoot a 63, Greg Norman had 
to struggle to break 80. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo ruined the story -- but he had help from Norman. Norman is a specialist 
at disappointing his fans, but he usually does it by having somebody chip in 
over his head or come flying out of a sand trap into a hole or by sinking a 
170-yard seven-iron from out on the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo didn't need any of these heroics. He beat him shot by shot, hole by hole. 
He merely shot a nice, easy, steady 67. It so unnerved Greg he began hitting 
the ball all over the place, including into those little pot bunkers that 
freckle the place and should be as avoidable as a bore at a cocktail party. 
</P>
<P>
Greg, as he often does, went looking for trouble like a sailor on leave. Faldo 
simply went about business like a law clerk cataloguing torts. He could play 
his kind of golf in a three-piece suit. Norman hits the ball excitingly. Faldo 
hits it straight. 
</P>
<P>
He does it without changing expression. You can never tell from looking at him 
whether Nick Faldo has just made birdie or bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Except, he never makes bogey. He's only made two in this tournament over 54 
holes. And the one he made at 17 Saturday was at least semi-deliberate. Jack 
Nicklaus says that hole is really a par 4 1/2, not par four. If you hit for the 
green over the chasm-sized bunker, you may make it -- and you may also make 
nine from the road behind. Faldo hit his second shot short of the trouble and 
made his nice comfortable bogey. 
</P>
<P>
That's Faldo's game. He won a British Open three years ago hitting 18 
consecutive pars on the final round. That's like winning a fight on clinches, a 
baseball game on bunts, a Super Bowl on punts or a card game with treys. 
</P>
<P>
That's all right with Nick Faldo. He plays how, not how many. 
</P>
<P>
Don't bet he won't shoot a nice shrewd boring 72 or 73 today to smuggle his 
British Open into the clubhouse. He says he won't. But Nick Faldo never shows 
his cards. 
</P>
<P>
We now have to consider this old Nick -- Nick Faldo, MBE for Member of the 
British Empire, stepping stone to knighthood -- is not only one of the premier 
players of the day but the premier player. 
</P>
<P>
Golf has been waiting for a monarch for a long time. Golf functions best that 
way. It resists mob rule, even democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo, it has been pointed out, in the last 12 "majors," has won three and been 
in the top four in seven of them. He won the Masters this year (for the second 
time), he was second in our Open (for the second time) and he seems about to 
win his second British Open. 
</P>
<P>
Those are Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus feats. Those are not posted 
by the cookie cutter class of modern golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Nick is not outwardly impressed with all his statistics. He is a rather gray 
character who moves with the deliberateness of an old waiter, the singleness of 
purpose of a lord-high executioner. He is dogged, relentless, careful, not 
colorful. He is as phlegmatic as a border guard. He just goes out and shoots 
par golf. He's not running for President. He leaves the smiling to Norman. 
Faldo seems to be operating under a permanent cloud cover. 
</P>
<P>
You would never mistake him for anything but an athlete. Like Norman, he has 
the classic build of a Greek statue. His shoulders are broad, his waist narrow. 
He almost never raises his voice. When a fellow competitor, Scott Hoch, was 
quoted as saying of him that he "needed a charisma transplant," Faldo readily 
accepted Hoch's explanation that he never said it. Faldo didn't really care. It 
didn't cost him any shots. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad he can't win his Open (assuming he does) at St. Andrews. I mean, 
this course cannot be that hallowed cradle of golf, that wrecker of scores, 
that scourge of tournaments. This helpless piece of real estate is so 
vulnerable this week -- no winds rake its promontories, no rain gales lash its 
fairways -- that the leader board looks like an explosion in a ketchup factory. 
It's full of red numbers, all but three players under par. 
</P>
<P>
One of those under is MBE Faldo who has shot 199 or 17-under. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect jubilation from Faldo. Just another day at the office. Don't 
expect any theatrics. Faldo won't go for the record, he'll go for the trophy. 
Faldo doesn't play for the ages, Faldo plays for the victories. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they spoil good stories.

BELCHER FACES 27 PIRATES, WINS, 6-0; 
</P>
<P>
ONE-HITTER: DODGER PITCHER GIVES UP A FOURTH-INNING SINGLE AND A SIXTH-INNING 
WALK. SAMUEL HITS A HOME RUN, DRIVES IN THREE RUNS.

PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than 24 hours after one of their worst games and their ugliest off-field 
incident of the year, the Dodgers needed something to help them forget. 
</P>
<P>
None too soon, Tim Belcher had a night to remember. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the minimum 27 hitters, Belcher allowed the Pittsburgh Pirates one hit 
and two baserunners in leading the Dodgers to a 6-0 victory before 39,498 
Saturday night at Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher surrendered only Jay Bell's single to center field on an 0-and-2 
fastball in the fourth inning in pitching the first one-hitter of his 
three-year career. It was the first Dodger one-hitter since Tim Leary beat 
Philadelphia on May 25, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It is also believed to be the first time a Dodger pitcher has faced the minimum 
number of hitters since Sandy Koufax's perfect game Sept. 9, 1965. Bell was 
caught stealing, and Mike LaValliere, who walked to start the sixth inning, was 
eliminated on a double-play grounder by pinch-hitter Orlando Merced. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something, isn't it?" Belcher said about the 27 hitters. "In the last 
couple of innings, I started thinking about it. Then in the end, when the last 
guy I faced was a pinch-hitter for the pitcher, I put two-and-two together and 
figured it out." 
</P>
<P>
Not so easy to figure was the contribution of second baseman Juan Samuel, who 
hit his seventh home run and drove in three runs. He was released from a jail 
cell eight hours before the game after being arraigned with teammate Alfredo 
Griffin on charges of simple assault after an early morning bar fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I get about three hours of sleep," Samuel said. "But just because (sleep loss) 
works one day doesn't mean I should do it every day." 
</P>
<P>
About the incident, Samuel said: "What happened to us can affect us in 
different ways. Maybe it will get me going in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel had entered the game batting .200 in July. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher was having lunch Saturday when he heard the news of the fight. His 
first thought was that it made sense, because it happened when he was scheduled 
to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher pitched the day Pedro Guerrero was traded. He pitched the day it was 
announced that Orel Hershiser required shoulder surgery. He pitched the day 
Willie Randolph was traded. 
</P>
<P>
"I always pitch on the day something happens that can put a team in an 
emotional tailspin," Belcher said. "After a while, you learn to go numb." 
</P>
<P>
But then the Pirate hitters, ranked third in the National League in scoring, 
went numb with him. They hit only eight balls out of the infield and struck out 
six times. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a lineup in which six of the first eight hitters can bat left-handed, 
the Pirates have lost three times to the right-handed Belcher in his four 
starts against them this season. He has a 1.02 earned-run average against them. 
</P>
<P>
And he could have beaten them four times if, citing a tired arm, he had not 
taken himself out of a one-hitter in the ninth inning of a May 28 game the 
Dodger bullpen lost, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't going to come out of this game," Belcher said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates could only wish. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time when you have to agree that somebody has your number," said 
R.J. Reynolds, Pirate outfielder. "And Belcher has our number. For somebody who 
came in here at .500 (7-7), to do what he did to us, you have to say he's got 
our number." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds nearly struck out three times on nine pitches, saving some dignity in 
his final at-bat by chopping the third pitch in front of home plate, where 
catcher Rick Dempsey grabbed the ball and threw him out.

Wednesday at Jack Murphy Stadium, the San Diego Padres will put on their annual 
"Working Women's Day" promotion. Who better to sing the national anthem than 
Roseanne Barr? 
</P>
<P>
Tom Werner, Padres' managing general partner, happens to be co-creator of 
"Roseanne," Barr's television series. But before anyone makes a sarcastic 
remark in nasal tones, remember that singing is part of Roseanne's new standup 
act. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Seaver, Padres' public relations director, said he's not worried. "If she 
didn't think that she could do a good job, she would not have accepted Tom 
Werner's offer," Seaver said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's probably in her shower right now warming up."

Dialing for ducats: Chicago Cub pitcher Rick Sutcliffe, a notorious practical 
joker, last week found himself on the other end of the gag. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and teammates designed and paid $7,000 for a billboard showing a high 
school yearbook picture of Sutcliffe wearing shoulder-length hair. Alongside 
the picture was an invitation to call his home phone for game tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll pay for this," Sutcliffe said. "I've got some ideas, but I don't think 
I should reveal them right now." 
</P>
<P>
The conspirators were Sutcliffe's wife, Robin, actor Mark Harmon, agent Barry 
Axelrod, Mark Grace of the Cubs, and Wally Joyner and Bert Blyleven of the 
Angels.

Trivia time: Who holds the American League rookie records for batting average

<P>
World Cup Mass: Monsignor Lorenzo Bertolino, pastor of Salvatore Consacrata al 
Crocefisso parish in Palermo, Sicily, will say a Mass on Aug. 6 to celebrate 
the tournament-high six goals scored by Palermo's Salvatore Schillaci of 
Italy's third-place World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bertolino: "I had the idea when I saw on TV how Schillaci made the sign of 
the cross with his hands after every goal he scored. He is called Salvatore, 
just like my church, his mother is a devout Christian. A Mass to give thanks 
for so many goals at the soccer World Cup seemed proper." 
</P>
<P>
Equipment Czech: If the Hartford Whalers were monitoring every development 
during the peaceful Czech revolution of 1989, it was for more than humanitarian 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Holik, the Whalers' top pick in last year's draft, was a soldier in the 
Czechoslovak army. 
</P>
<P>
But the Whalers didn't need to worry. Holik, who signed a four-year, $800,000 
contract with the team in March and was released from the army on June 30, said 
he touched a gun only five times and fired one only once. 
</P>
<P>
"I shoot badly," said Holik, who will join the Whalers for the coming season. 
"I shoot the puck better." 
</P>
<P>
South Bronx Blues: To a Yankee fan, the word "harmonica" conjures memories of a 
less-troubled time, when Manager Yogi Berra quarreled with shortstop Phil Linz 
because Linz played his harmonica on the team bus after a tough loss. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the news that Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly has taken up playing 
the harmonica . . . to help take his mind off baseball. Mattingly, whose season 
has been anything but harmonic, says playing the instrument relaxes him. He 
takes it on road trips and plays in his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he should play it on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
That'll be Golfer Brad Lardon, who plays on the Ben Hogan Tour, told Associated 
Press about how he has improved his putting this year. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lardon: "Jack Burke of the Champions Golf Club in Houston gave me a great 
putting tip. He told me to use a five-iron and chip 100 balls on the green and 
around the hole. When I made 100 in a row I was told to come back for lesson 
No. 2."

Dave Mora wasn't considered good enough to wear the uniform of the United 
States team in the Goodwill Games marathon. 
</P>
<P>
But when the race was run Saturday in Seattle, there was nobody better than 
Mora. 
</P>
<P>
Mora, an added entry, burst into the lead with about four miles to go and won 
in 2 hours 14 minutes 49 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
A 26-year-old from Bloomington, Ind., who did not wear a U.S. uniform because 
he was the fourth U.S. selection, passed tiring leader Thomas Robert Naali of 
Tanzania and defeated Soviet Nikolai Tabak by almost two minutes in his 
best-ever time. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw (Naali) slowing down for a long time and I thought that if I would pace 
it, he would come to me," Mora said. "That's the way it worked. 
</P>
<P>
"And when I caught him, I threw a little surge -- and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Tabak clocked 2:16:27 for second place and Canadian Peter Maher finished third 
in 2:17:15. 
</P>
<P>
Naali, a 21-year-old prison guard running his first marathon, led the entire 
race until Mora passed him on a flat portion of the often-hilly course through 
the streets along Lake Washington, Lake Union and Elliott Bay. Naali finished 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not too big a mileage runner," said Mora, who trained primarily for the 
10,000 meters before this. 
</P>
<P>
Mora originally was left off because of a misunderstanding, then allowed to 
compete as an "invited guest" by The Athletics Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I would beat all the other Americans on the team," Mora said. "I had 
that feeling because I had been running very well. . . . I would have liked to 
have worn the U.S. uniform, but I'm still an American." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet gymnasts Vitali Scherbo and Valeri Belenki took the gold and silver 
medals in the men's all-around competition at Tacoma, while American Lance 
Ringnald won the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets dominated the competition, scoring highest in five of six events 
and tying in the remaining event, the high bar. 
</P>
<P>
Scherbo won the gold with a score of 59.20 points, and Belenki scored 58.65. 
</P>
<P>
Ringnald had 58.20 to take the bronze ahead of teammate Chris Waller, who had 
57.80, in the best U.S. finish in the all-around event in major international 
competition since Peter Vidmar's silver medal at the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Scherbo, who placed fifth in the 1990 European championships in 
the all-around event, scored a competition high 9.95 on the vault. His lowest 
score was a 9.75 on the parallel bars. 
</P>
<P>
While the Soviets easily won the gold and silver, it was a three-way battle for 
the bronze among Ringnald, Waller and Sylvio Kroll of East Germany, who ended 
up tied for sixth with China's Guo Linyao at 57.50. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union won four gold medals and East Germany took two in the first 
day of rowing. 
</P>
<P>
The top Americans were Kris Karlson of Keene, Conn.; Alison Townley of 
Minneapolis, who finished second in the women's open double sculls; Rob 
Shepherd of Lafayette, Calif.; Christian Sahs of Southborough, Mass.; Jeff 
McLaughlin, Warwick, R.I., and Patrick Manning of Hyde Park, N.Y., who were 
fourth in the men's fours with coxswain. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet winners were Girt Vilks and Valeri Dosenko in the men's open double 
sculls, Vladimir Romanishin, Igor Bortnitski, Sigitas Kuchinskis and Petr 
Petrinich in the open fours with coxswain, Tatyana Borisova and Liliya 
Aleshkina in the women's lightweight pairs without coxswain, and Sariya 
Zakirova and Svetlana Mazi in the open double sculls. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's Uwe Kellner, Thomas Jung, Frank Pawloski, Andreas Hache took the 
open fours without coxswain, and the East German women's eight of Birhte Siech, 
Heike Winkler, Annegret Strauch, Janette Barth, Antje Frank, Una Justh, Kathrin 
Haacker, Judith Zeidler and Daniela Neunast also won. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners were Vaclav Chalupa of Czechoslovakia in the men's open single 
sculls and Mette Block Jensen of Denmark in the women's lightweight single 
sculls.

Names and Numbers 
</P>
<P>
* Runless Redbirds: Whitey Herzog or not, the beat goes on for the St. Louis 
Cardinals, who through 90 games had scored three or fewer runs 50 times and two 
or fewer 38 times. Said Pedro Guerrero: "It's embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
I'd probably quit and go home like Whitey did if they'd tell me I'd still get 
my money, like he is." 
</P>
<P>
* Fearsome Twosome: Andre Dawon and Ryne Sandberg continue to brighten a dismal 
summer for the Chicago Cubs. Each is on a pace to drive in more than 100 runs. 
The Cubs haven't had two players do that since 1970, when they had three -- 
Billy Williams, 129; Jim Hickman, 115, and Ron Santo, 114. 
</P>
<P>
* Rebounding: Montreal Expos first baseman Andres Gallaraga has started to 
emerge from a long slumber, collecting five home runs, seven doubles and 18 
runs batted in during his last 17 games, through Thursday. Amid talk of a trade 
involving Gallaraga, Manager Bob Rodgers said: "He's been in a two-year slump, 
but if he ever gets going, like he's starting to now, he can carry a club. I 
say don't trade him." 
</P>
<P>
* Tribute: Don Robinson, battling an arthritic hip and timebomb knees, is 6-1 
for the San Francisco Giants. Said Manager Roger Craig: "He's the best 
competitor I've ever had play for me, the best I've ever played with and the 
best I've ever played against." ROSS NEWHAN

MCDONALD ARRIVES FOR ORIOLES A YEAR LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Baltimore Orioles made Ben McDonald the first selection in the 1989 
June draft, they thought the 6-foot-7 right-hander from Louisiana State was 
ready for the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it turned out he was a little more than a year away. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald made his first start Saturday night at Baltimore, pitching a 
four-hitter as the Orioles beat the Chicago White Sox, 2-0. It was only the 
second time the White Sox have been shut out this season. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, who was ineffective in six relief appearances last season and good in 
several this season after being called up in July, retired the last 16 White 
Sox after Ron Kittle's single in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
He had to be good, because former Stanford star Jack McDowell gave up only five 
hits and struck out 10. He retired the last 14 Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to finally get the start," McDonald said after needing only 85 
pitches to handle the White Sox. "I didn't know whether I would get it later 
this year, or not until next year. I felt I was ready to get one. I want to be 
in the rotation. I'm much more comfortable as a starting pitcher than as a 
reliever." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald made six relief appearances last season. He lasted only 7 1/3 innings 
and had an earned-run average of 8.59. 
</P>
<P>
This season, his progress was hampered by several injuries. He was 3-3 with an 
ERA of 2.86 when the Orioles brought him up from triple-A Rochester on July 3. 
He appeared several times in relief before Manager Frank Robinson decided he 
was ready to start. He was ready, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to see him finish like that," Robinson said. "He went right after 
the hitters." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Orsulak and Billy Ripken drove in runs for the Orioles, who have won three 
in a row over the White Sox and 10 of their last 13. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 2, Oakland 1 -- Dave Stieb is a good pitcher at Toronto, but on the 
road -- especially at Oakland -- the veteran right-hander is outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb (12-3) held the World Series champion Athletics to five hits in eight 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
George Bell and Pat Borders hit home runs to back Stieb's second-best 
performance of the season. His best effort was May 28, also at Oakland, when he 
pitched a three-hitter and won, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
"The A's pounded me in Toronto recently," Stieb said. "I've pitched two good 
games here. I like this ballpark. No wonder Dave Stewart and Bob Welch enjoy 
pitching here." 
</P>
<P>
Stieb is 6-0 on the road this season with an ERA of 2.78. The Blue Jays, 
battling Boston for first place in the East, are 25-20 on the road, the only 
team in the division with a winning record away from home. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the home run pitches to Bell in the fifth inning and Borders in the 
sixth, Scott Sanderson (11-6) was brilliant. He gave up only one other hit, an 
infield single by Bell, in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb easily could have had his second shutout of the year at Oakland. He was 
leading, 2-0, in the eighth and the A's had a man on second with one out. Jose 
Canseco hit a towering drive to center. Mookie Wilson lost it in the sun, it 
fell for a double. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 8, Texas 1 -- Cecil Fielder hit his major league-leading 31st home run 
to lead the Tigers at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, after not playing the previous two games, hit a three-run homer in the 
first inning to get Dan Petry off to a good start. 
</P>
<P>
Petry (7-6) gave up only two hits in eight innings to win for the first time in 
eight starts since June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 2, New York 1 -- Mark Guthrie gave up only four hits in 7 2/3 innings 
at Minneapolis and won for the first time since May 31. It was the 13th loss in 
18 games for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 4, Boston 2 -- Pinch-hitter Mike Macfarlane hit a two-run, go-ahead 
double in a three-run eighth inning at Kansas City that knocked the Red Sox out 
of first place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Boston had led the East since June 25 but fell one-half game behind Toronto 
after losing three out of their last four games. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 10, Seattle 3 -- Greg Vaughn hit two home runs and drove in a 
career-high six runs at Milwaukee to lead the Brewers' rout of the Mariners.

LUYENDYK GETS FINE, PROBATION FOR TRACK VIOLATION 
</P>

<DATELINE>

TORONTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arie Luyendyk of the Netherlands, winner of the Indianapolis 500, was fined 
Saturday and placed on probation for the rest of the season for a track 
violation during Friday's qualifying session for the Molson-Indy race. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Dallenbach, chief steward for CART, the Indy-car sanctioning body, said 
Luyendyk was penalized for failing to observe the checkered flag at the end of 
the 30-minute qualifying session. 
</P>
<P>
"I accept the fine and I understand why they are doing it," Luyendyk said. "All 
I can say is that I didn't do it intentionally and I'm sorry for any rules 
infraction. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think that probation is a bit harsh, but that's what's been decided and 
we'll put this incident behind us and go on with our program for the week." 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch driver reportedly ran three fast laps on the 1.78-mile, 11-turn 
temporary circuit after the checkered flag was displayed, then sped down pit 
lane with crew members, officials and media already over the pit wall.

MEARS TAKES INSIDE ROUTE TO VICTORY

<P>
Roger Mears used inside information to win the sports truck main event Saturday 
night in front of 46,347 fans at the Mickey Thompson Off-Road Championship Gran 
Prix in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Mears won only his third stadium race in the past 3 1/2 years by taking the 
inside line up the peristyle jump on the opening lap and breezing to a 
12-second victory over Danny Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Mears started on the pole along side crowd-favorite Ivan Stewart, but he left 
Stewart behind by taking the inside line up the hill. Stewart and Walker Evans 
elected to try the outside line and it proved to be a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Mears had a commanding lead after only one lap in what proved to be a very 
uneventful main event. Evans finished third and Rod Millen was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
For Mears, the victory was a long time coming after countless hours of testing 
and refining his Nissan truck at his shop in Bakersfield. Mears' last victory 
was in September in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
In the most exciting race of the night, Jimmy Nichols passed Frank Arciero on a 
series of double jumps in the 10th lap and went on to win the 1600cc dune buggy 
main event. Arciero battled Jerry Whelchel for the opening three laps of the 
12-lap race, but Whelchel was forced to retire with a broken front axle after 
colliding with a barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Arciero appeared to be headed for a victory, but Nichols made up ground going 
up the peristyle jump and then took the lead after sailing down the jump and 
heading into the double jumps. Arciero finished second and Wes Elrod was third.

NEWSWIRE: VOGLER KILLED IN SPRINT CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Vogler, five-time United States Auto Club midget champion, was killed 
Saturday night when he crashed during a sprint car race at Salem (Ind.) 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dan Anderson pronounced Vogler dead at 11:40 p.m. EDT at the Washington 
County Memorial Hospital in Salem, according to Bill Marvel, vice president of 
USAC. The crash occurred about 40 minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Floyd, an ambulance medic for the hospital, described the 39-year-old 
Vogler as having a "severe head injury." 
</P>
<P>
Vogler, leading the race at the time, was running alone when he crashed coming 
off the high-banked fourth turn. He was about to take the white flag for the 
final lap at the half-mile oval in a race televised nationally by ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
Vogler remained motionless for several minutes before being removed by 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the car were strewn about the front stretch between the turn and the 
start-finish line, but the protective roll cage and the driver's pod remained 
attached to most of chassis. 
</P>
<P>
The car hit the guardrail and destroyed a section of protective fencing near 
the grandstand. No other cars were involved and no other injuries reported. 
</P>
<P>
Vogler was declared the winner when the 30-lap race was red-flagged. Under USAC 
rules, the leader of the last green-flag lap before a race-ending red flag is 
credited with the victory. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his five midget titles, Vogler won the national sprint car 
championship in 1980. Before this season, he had 122 victories in sprints, 
midgets and dirt cars. Last year he won 16 of the 33 races en route to his 
fifth midget championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Indianapolis native raced in five Indianapolis 500s. He failed to qualify 
this year after an eighth-place finish, his best ever, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Vogler's father, Don, was killed in a crash in 1981 while practicing for a USAC 
midget race at the Indianapolis Speedrome. 
</P>
<P>
Vogler had been scheduled to make his debut in NASCAR Winston Cup racing by 
starting 32nd today in the AC Spark Plug 500 at Pocono International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Vogler ranked second only to A.J. Foyt in USAC career victories. Foyt has 158. 
</P>
<P>
Vogler is survived by his widow, Emily, and three sons.

DEPOSIT TICKET HOLDS ON IN JUVENILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deposit Ticket fought off the challenge of favored Avenue of Flags in the 
stretch to score a one-length victory in the $101,500 Hollywood Juvenile 
Championship Saturday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Racing to his first stakes victory, the son of Northern Baby took the early 
lead in the six furlong race and held it until challenged by Avenue of Flags 
midway down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
But the winner responded to the urging of jockey Gary Stevens to score the 
victory in the good time of 1:09. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth career start for Deposit Ticket, who scored his first victory 
last month with Stevens as his rider. Avenue of Flags raced closest to the 
leader, whose stablemate Iroquois Park was among the top three in the early 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
Deposit Ticket was coupled with Iroquois Park as the entry of trainer Wayne 
Lukas, which was sent off as third choice in the wagering to pay $7.40, $3.20 
and $2.40. Avenue of Flags paid $3.40 and $2.40 while Stone God, the third 
place finisher, returned $4.20. 
</P>
<P>
Broadway's Top Gun, unbeaten in three previous races, faded to fifth as second 
choice in the wagering. The winner earned a purse of $56,600 for the stable of 
Lukas and W.T. Young, of Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
The Juvenile in the past has been won by such outstanding young performers as 
Affirmed and Tomy Lee, both Kentucky Derby winners, and numerous other 
outstanding performers. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Stalwart Charger, winner of his last three stakes races, seeks his 
richest victory in the $200,000 Swap Stakes at one and a quarter miles. Silver 
Ending heads the opposition in the field of five, which includes Jovial and 
Toby Jug.

<P>
There are times when government regulations -- if not adequately enforced -- 
are counterproductive. Such may be the case with financial planners and other 
investment advisers. 
</P>
<P>
That's the conclusion of the General Accounting Office, the watchdog arm of 
Congress. It concluded in a report issued last week that regulations requiring 
investment advisers to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
submit to periodic review are not well serving the investing public. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the SEC is poorly staffed and, thus, does not adequately review 
registered advisers, whose numbers have more than tripled over the past decade 
to about 14,000 people managing about $4.6 trillion in assets, the GAO said. 
(Thousands more people who call themselves financial planners are 
unregistered.) 
</P>
<P>
And even when advisers are reviewed, often only inadequate disclosure or 
record-keeping problems are uncovered, the GAO said. The SEC does little to 
ensure that deficiencies are corrected, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, unscrupulous advisers can still run amok, fleecing investors out 
of hundreds of millions of dollars every year, according to some estimates. 
Current law "may be doing more harm than good" by lulling investors into a 
false sense of security that SEC-registered advisers "have a 'seal of 
approval,' " the GAO concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The agency noted that one unidentified investor who lost her life savings of 
$60,000 said she had been "impressed" that her adviser was registered with the 
SEC. 
</P>
<P>
Several efforts are under way to boost regulation of financial planners and 
other advisers. Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) has submitted a bill, generally 
backed by state regulators and the financial planning industry, that would 
require anyone offering investment advice -- including financial planners -- to 
pay to register with the SEC and provide clients with full disclosure of their 
qualifications. The bill also would give customers the right to sue for damages 
when they lose money because of law violations. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC also supports tightened registration requirements, SEC Commissioner 
Mary L. Schapiro told a House panel last week. The commission wants to use 
registration fees to help pay for enforcement, she said. Previously, the agency 
supported enhanced adviser oversight through a self-regulatory organization 
such as the National Assn. of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Even if regulation and oversight is toughened, the ultimate responsibility for 
scrutinizing advisers is yours, not the government's. The SEC, Congress and 
other watchdogs can only do so much; you must take steps on your own to be sure 
you're not ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some key pointers to help you in that effort: 
</P>
<P>
* Don't get a false sense of security. Just because a planner is registered 
doesn't mean he or she is honest and competent. To register under the federal 
Investment Adviser Act, all you have to do is pay $150 to the SEC, fill out a 
short form and wait 45 days for it to be processed. No professional standards 
must be met, or tests passed, to secure SEC registration. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, anyone can call himself a financial planner, whether registered or 
not. Indeed, someone once enrolled a dog as a member of a financial planning 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Far too many folks are calling themselves financial planners; the public has 
no assurance that the person they are dealing with is regulated in any way," 
says Dale E. Brown, director of government affairs at the International Assn. 
of Financial Planners in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
* Know the types of planners and their potential conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
There are three types. Some planners receive commissions for their services, 
much as stockbrokers do. But be aware that they may try to sell you certain 
products not because those products are best for you, but because they earn the 
highest commission. 
</P>
<P>
Another type, fee-only planners, generally receive an annual fee or an hourly 
fee -- usually between $50 and $200. The third type receive both fees and 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
* Use referrals. Ask friends or relatives for references. Ask one or more of 
the organizations that accredit financial planners for lists of planners in 
your area who meet their standards. 
</P>
<P>
One of these is the International Assn. of Financial Planners in Atlanta, (404) 
395-1605. It provides a booklet listing planners who have met its most rigid 
standards. The association also provides a free booklet, "Consumer's Guide to 
Financial Independence," available by calling the association or writing it at: 
2 Concourse Plaza, Suite 800, Atlanta, Ga. 30328. 
</P>
<P>
Another is the Institute of Certified Financial Planners in Denver, (800) 
282-PLAN. It will refer you to up to five certified financial planners in your 
area, and give you biographical information on them, along with their fee 
structure and work experience. It also offers a free booklet, "First Steps to 
Financial Security: A Guide for Selecting a Certified Financial Planner," which 
you can get by writing the institute at: 10065 E. Harvard Ave., Suite 320, 
Denver, Colo. 80231. 
</P>
<P>
* Interview more than one planner. And ask probing questions. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of Better Business Bureaus, in its booklet "Tips on Financial 
Planners," suggests the following questions to ask planners before selecting 
one: 
</P>
<P>
What is your professional background? How long have you been a financial 
planner? How long have you been in the community? Will you provide references 
from three or more clients you have counseled for at least two years? Will I be 
dealing with you or an associate? May I see examples of plans and monitoring 
reports that you have drawn up for other investors? What financial planning 
trade organizations do you belong to? 
</P>
<P>
You can obtain the council's booklet by sending $1 and a self-addressed, 
stamped business envelope to: Council of Better Business Bureaus, 4200 Wilson 
Blvd., Suite 800, Arlington, Va. 22203. 
</P>
<P>
* Recognize the "red flags" of financial planning fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of Better Business Bureaus suggests avoiding advisers who urge you 
to put money in anything with a "guaranteed" rate of return well above 
prevailing market rates. Such investments often entail much higher risk -- or 
are simply fraudulent. They might be so-called Ponzi schemes -- sham 
investments in which the promoter uses money from some investors to pay 
"profits" to others. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the council suggests, avoid planners who give you no investment 
alternatives. They could be trying to steer you into a fraudulent scheme or 
they may be more interested in making a fat commission than in serving your 
best interests. 
</P>
<P>
And be wary of planners without a staff. Those working without an office or 
permanent address may be fly-by-night operators. Try to visit the planner's 
office; make sure he or she has ties with other professionals, such as lawyers 
and accountants. That's because few planners have the expertise and credentials 
to provide all the investment services you'll need.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernie Rooney is the ultimate organization man. 
</P>
<P>
His shoes shine. His suit, tie and shirt look crisp. His personal calendar and 
office calendar, which always are at his fingertips, are penciled in perfectly 
and don't have messy scraps of paper and business cards falling out of them. 
</P>
<P>
He is on time. When he gives a seminar, he hands out neat yellow name cards. 
His reference materials are lined up tidily in front of him. A small, 
unobtrusive clock that he sets before him keeps him on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
He is enough to drive the average white-collar worker, who is a disorganized 
mess, crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney is with the paper police. As chief financial officer and a trainer for 
the Institute for Business Technology, a consulting firm that promises to 
increase white-collar productivity by getting people to organize themselves and 
their work, he has forced hundreds of Washington area office workers, managers 
and executives to do the unthinkable: Throw out their paper, reports, 
loose-leaf notebooks, memos, yellow stickums, ancient phone messages, useless 
magazines and dusty old issues of the company's revised employee handbook. 
</P>
<P>
He has gotten them to stop ignoring their voice mail and return phone messages 
immediately. They have stopped putting off big projects and now use the "salami 
technique," taking a small bite out of them every day. Their desks have three 
trays on them: "In," "Out" and "Pending." The "In" tray is not overflowing with 
mail from three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
They now have a file system that separates work into three categories: working 
files, research files and archives, which are removed from the office. The 
super-organized set up what Rooney calls "tickler" files to remind themselves 
of what they have to do that day. They set up "action plans" to persuade 
themselves that they will live by Rooney's rules of neatness and cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
And, those who become true disciples of IBT's personal efficiency program, or 
PEP, learn to scour their desks clean to the point where they have only one 
thing in front of them to work on. Their mantra is "Do It Now." Instead of 
putting off things that they hate to do, they "Do the Worst First." 
</P>
<P>
"Reorganization isn't the purpose of the program," said Rooney. "We come in to 
get you focused on your job. But you can't do it if you are disorganized." 
</P>
<P>
Improving the productivity of office workers is one of the truly important but 
difficult challenges confronting business. Although productivity -- hourly 
output per worker -- has declined throughout the business sector since the 
early 1970s, the slump in the service sector has been worse than in 
manufacturing. Boosting the efficiency and productivity of "knowledge" workers 
in an information-age office is a lot harder than for assembly workers in a 
production plant. 
</P>
<P>
To attack this problem, IBT charges $4,000 to put seven people through its PEP 
program, which includes a seminar, an office cleaning and follow-up visits to 
make sure what has been learned is applied. Then IBT comes back for surprise 
visits that span a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole goal of the program is to get you to be more efficient with the 
least amount of effort," Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing the Personal Efficiency Program has been relatively simple. IBT, 
which was founded in 1983 in Stockholm by marketing consultant Kerry Gleeson, 
plays on guilt and workplace truisms such as "Are you always short of time?" or 
"Do you work extra hours to catch up on what you don't do during normal hours?" 
and "Do you have too much to do?" 
</P>
<P>
IBT promises that once a hanging-file system and a decent desk calendar become 
part of its employees' work lives, companies can achieve bigger objectives such 
as improving quality, offering better customer service, reducing costs or 
weathering a reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
"This is to get people to produce, not teach time management," said Gleeson, 
who thinks his technique will do for white-collar workers what assembly lines 
have done for the blue-collar world. 
</P>
<P>
IBT, which has $3.25 million in sales and has put 200,000 people through the 
program in Europe, came to the United States two years ago. Gleeson hopes to 
franchise his idea beyond the offices he has already opened in Washington, 
Boston and Boca Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of managers and middle managers haven't the foggiest idea 
about how to work," said Gleeson, confiding that the secret to his success has 
been getting others to work. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, despite the federal Paperwork Reduction Act, looked like a natural. 
</P>
<P>
"We noticed a definite need in Washington," said IBT's Rooney. "It's a 
work-driven environment. Everybody is crisis-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
This morning at 8:30 sharp, Rooney has seven victims from Contel ASC in 
Rockville, Md., a provider of data communication networks, sequestered in a 
sunny conference room for the kickoff two-hour seminar and video. 
</P>
<P>
He lets them in on a few secrets, like 80% of your work is in 20% of your 
files. He promises that file drawers that now are stuffed too full to open will 
be half empty by the time he gets through with them by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
PEP participants are relieved of their regular duties for the day, and are 
advised not to take or make phone calls. Their bosses have been told not to 
bother them. Management has been advised to stock the supply room with plenty 
of trash cans and hanging file folders. 
</P>
<P>
They don't know what is about to happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Does anyone know what they are in for today?" Rooney asks with a smile. "We're 
known as desk busters. You're going to do it and I assist. Or if you don't do 
it, I do it for you." 
</P>
<P>
It's the ultimate in the invasion of workplace privacy. This is not like other 
time-management or executive-organization seminars where someone politely 
suggests that the key to being more productive at work is to make lists and 
delegate. 
</P>
<P>
This is Rooney doing hands-on housecleaning of desk drawers, files and offices. 
This is Rooney checking back not once, but several times, to make sure you have 
straightened out your work space, that you plan ahead and that you set goals. 
</P>
<P>
He acts like your friend, but he really is your mom. 
</P>
<P>
About 11 a.m. he gets down to business in the small, somewhat claustrophobic 
office of financial analyst Vicki Hatfield. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield, one of 72 Contel employees who have gone through PEP training, was 
voted as having the messiest office. She came prepared in blue jeans to fight 
overflowing files and the messes left by her predecessor in the job. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield already uses three trays. She has a calendar, a Rolodex and a stapler. 
Not much is stuck up on the bulletin board. Then Rooney pulls out her top left 
drawer. 
</P>
<P>
"What are all these?" he asks quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"All the materials from my quality training," Hatfield says, looking guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney pulls a Spiegel catalogue out of the drawer. "Don't keep anything 
horizontal in a small drawer," he says, dropping the catalogue in the trash 
can. 
</P>
<P>
He turns to the top drawer of her desk. "That's not bad. Everything is 
contained," he mumbles, automatically disentangling binder clips, paper clips 
and rubber bands that are jumbled together. 
</P>
<P>
He starts pulling out files. "The point is to get everything out," he says, 
creating a mountain of manila folders on Hatfield's desk that begins to fall 
over and spill out paper. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield looks pained. "I'm normally a very organized person," she says. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:30, it's over, at least until after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't dump your file cabinets until I get back," Rooney instructs on his way 
out to another mess down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney keeps asking each employee, "How do you feel so far?" as if he is 
guarding against nervous breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He warns them not to go to extremes on their first day because in his fight 
against procrastination and paper overload, Rooney has seen it all. One 
Washington executive had IBT in for a marketing presentation. His office was 
spotless. Not a thing out of place on his desk. Rooney and Ira Chaleff, 
managing partner for the Washington office, wondered why someone with such a 
neat office needed them. 
</P>
<P>
Then the executive took them down the hall to his real office, revealing that 
he was a closet slob. 
</P>
<P>
The key to IBT's success, says founder Gleeson, is that people are not left to 
face their messes alone. They get someone like Rooney to spend time with them, 
trying to figure out why they put reading material in their briefcases and then 
never read it. Or why they keep dozens of interoffice envelopes stuffed into 
bottom drawers. Or why they can't ever part with anything. 
</P>
<P>
"If I clean my office out it won't look like I do anything," said Contel 
treasury assistant Michele Brice, coming up with one of the classic excuses. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney, who considers himself a sort of personal trainer in efficiency, has 
observed that if people are left to their own devices, no more than 40% 
"initiate action when I tell them to get in there (and clean it up)." 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said about 75% of the people who go through the program get some 
benefit. The most basic pay-back is saving time: You save eight full days over 
a year if you pick up just 15 minutes a day at work that you wasted in 
meaningless actions such as picking up the same piece of paper 10 times before 
you act on it -- which is the average. 
</P>
<P>
"They brought some organization to the madness," said Thomas Veystrk, vice 
president of human resources for Jos. A. Bank Clothiers in Baltimore, which put 
10 of its top managers, including the company's president, through the PEP 
program recently. 
</P>
<P>
The hope was that managers would use their time more effectively and be able to 
juggle a number of projects at one time without losing control. 
</P>
<P>
Contel brought in IBT to help with a reorganization in its finance department 
and to complement an in-house program that stresses improving quality. 
</P>
<P>
"People are better able to plan and set priorities," said Margaret Brady, 
Contel vice president of finance. "As we bring new people into the company, we 
get them trained. It's only effective if everyone talks the same language." 
</P>
<P>
And the language is fairly simple. It boils down to three little words that can 
transform you from a person who has piles of files on your desk to one who has 
working files, research files and archives. 
</P>
<P>
"Do It Now," said Rooney.

<TEXT>
<P>
I have a lot of respect for the cable music channel VH-1. So I hope the channel 
stops its disreputable practice of continuously plastering VH-1 over all the 
videos. This is equivalent to a radio deejay whispering the call letters of his 
or her station over and over during the songs.

GOSSETT'S GONE GONZO; 
</P>
<P>
THE TOUGH GUY PLANS A FUNNY BAD GUY IN HBO'S WACKY WESTERN

Intimidating. No-nonsense. Dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
These words best describe Oscar- and Emmy Award-winning Louis Gossett Jr.'s 
screen personae. That is until "El Diablo," HBO's comedic Western adventure, 
which premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Gossett plays an aging gunslinger named Thomas Van Leek who helps a young 
schoolteacher (Anthony Edwards) rescue a beautiful young pupil from the 
clutches of the evil outlaw El Diablo. Van Leek chews tobacco and carries an 
arsenal of guns. 
</P>
<P>
Van Leek is a definite 360-degree turn from Gossett's Oscar-winning role as the 
tough drill instructor in "An Officer and a Gentleman." He's not above shooting 
his enemies in the back to save his own skin. He puts cotton in the sensitive 
ears of his old horse every time he becomes embroiled in a gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a ball doing stuff like that," Gossett said gleefully while relaxing on 
the leather sofa in the living room of his Malibu home. "For me it's a chance 
to be funny. It's not like 'Officer and a Gentleman' or 'Iron Eagle.' I got a 
chance to put tobacco in my mouth and get cantankerous and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
"Very, very good actors come out of the woodwork to do comedy," said Peter 
Markle, who directed "El Diablo." "We always knew Tony (Edwards) was funny, but 
not Lou. I think he aged himself about 15 years and adopted this gravely voice 
as this gunslinger in his waning years. It's an excellent part and Lou is a 
real pro. He reminded me of Gene Hackman (whom Markle directed in "Bat 21"). He 
has a great sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Before production began, Gossett created a history for Van Leek. "The history 
came with putting the wardrobe together," he said, petting one of his two cats. 
The actor opted for an old buffalo soldier cap, a makeshift military jacket and 
worn boots. "He's upwards of 60 and he's a gunfighter that's still alive. How 
do you do that? You don't give him a chance to face anybody. You shoot them in 
the back. That's how you survive. I got a gun for every occasion and three on 
my horse. You show your enemies that and most of the time they back off. He is 
weather-beaten and cantankerous. All of a sudden, he becomes fleshed out." 
</P>
<P>
Gossett has been searching for roles that will get him away from his stern 
image. "I am going against 'Officer and a Gentleman,' " he said. "When I go 
around the world, people want me to look and act like that all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Though Gossett has agreed to star in a sequel to both "Officer and a Gentleman" 
and "Iron Eagle," he turned down a series version of "Officer" and a commercial 
featuring his character. "It was a lucrative commercial," he said, "but I would 
have been stuck. The series would have been flat." 
</P>
<P>
Actors, Gossett maintains, are divided into two groups. "There are people who 
get discovered at 21 and they look young and wonderful," he said. "Then 20 
years later they are still trying to play the same part. It's terrible for your 
system. Then there are the Henry Fondas, the Jimmy Cagneys and Sean Connerys. 
They are the ones that grow gracefully in front of the camera. That is much 
healthier." 
</P>
<P>
At 54, Gossett is happy and healthy and wants his roles to reflect that. "I 
want to stay as versatile as possible," he said. "Versatility is synonymous 
with longevity." 
</P>
<P>
Gossett is not above taking smaller roles in low-budget features or cable 
movies such as "El Diablo." "I did one movie for Lifetime, 'Sudie and Simpson,' 
" he said. "It was a wonderful experience. ('Sudie and Simpson" is set to air 
Sept. 11). It wasn't a high-budget thing, but the part was wonderful. I think 
cable movies expand a career. You don't overload the budget of a movie and you 
get a chance to do things that are really relevant. I think 'El Diablo' is a 
major movie. It should be seen in the movie houses. It's a big budget looking 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
Gossett is eager to ride the range again. " 'El Diablo' was my first big 
feature Western," he said. "There are some people in history I would like to 
do-James Beckworth, a mountain man who founded the Northwest Passage and became 
chief of the Crow nation, and there is Deadwood Dick and Railroad Bill. There 
are a lot of wonderful stories." 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, Gossett wants to make audiences laugh. "I would love to do 
another comedy," he said. "It was wonderful to be funny. I have been serious 
too long. It's time for me to lighten up."

PIPER LAURIE'S PEAKS AND VALLEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I think wickedness is more effective in an innocent-looking package, don't 
you?," asked Piper Laurie. "People let themselves become more vulnerable around 
an innocent-looking package." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie, who looks the innocent even after 40 years in show business, has played 
her share of wicked ladies-including her Oscar-nominated turn as the religious 
fanatic mother in Brian De Palma's 1976 thriller, "Carrie," and currently as 
the scheming Catherine Martell on ABC's "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
But after playing a bevy of bad ladies, Laurie gets to show her human side in 
TNT's "Rising Son," which premieres Monday at 5, 7 and 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Dennehy stars with Laurie as her factory foreman husband. Their lives 
change when the factory closes and he's unemployed. "She is very soft and very 
open and loving," said Laurie. "It was nice (to play that) for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie is returning to "Twin Peaks," so Catherine Martell must have survived 
the mill fire of last season's cliffhanger finale, right? 
</P>
<P>
"Just wait," she said with a hearty laugh, "you haven't seen anything yet." 
</P>
<P>
The actress had met David Lynch, "Twin Peaks" co-creator and executive 
producer, several times. "I was fond of him," she said. "I thought it would be 
a stimulating, fun thing to work with him and I was right. When I was offered 
the part, I grabbed it. I didn't think it would go beyond the pilot, because 
most (pilots) don't." 
</P>
<P>
The actress had no inkling the series would become such a phenomenon. Recently, 
"a chef popped out of a restaurant kitchen and said, 'I am a 'Twin Peak-er.' 
Don't die in the fire.' " 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 40 years, Laurie's career has had many peaks and valleys. As a 
contract player with Universal Studios in the early '50s, the actress was cast 
as the ingenue in lightweight movies. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated with one-dimensional roles, Laurie walked out of her contract. She 
said, "I wouldn't work again unless someone gave me a decent part." 
</P>
<P>
Though Hollywood wasn't willing, live TV was. She got the chance to strut her 
stuff in the mid-'50s on an episode of "Robert Montgomery Presents." 
</P>
<P>
"I had a couple of flamboyant scenes, very dramatic," she said. "I remember 
afterwards (director) Joe Mankiewicz called my agent to say what a wonderful 
young actress I was. It was the beginning of people respecting me at all." 
</P>
<P>
She subsequently received Emmy nominations for her work in "Days of Wine and 
Roses," "The Deaf Heart" and "The Road That Led After." Her newfound success 
culminated with her Oscar nomination for best actress as Paul Newman's 
alcoholic, disabled girlfriend in 1961's "The Hustler." 
</P>
<P>
At the peak of her career, though, Laurie retired from acting, married and gave 
birth to a daughter. "I was in the McGovern campaign in upstate New York," she 
said. "We had a group of musicians and actors and we would travel to colleges. 
There were about a dozen of us and sometimes we played to groups that were 
smaller than we were." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie said she didn't miss the limelight: "My life was full. I always liked 
using my hands, and I always painted." 
</P>
<P>
But she finally started to get the urge to act about 15 years ago. "When I was 
beginning to feel that it would be fun to act again, somebody must have gotten 
those vibrations out there," she said. The somebody was director Brian De 
Palma. 
</P>
<P>
Her former agent called her up one day to tell her De Palma was interested in 
her playing the crazed mother of telekinetic Sissy Spacek in "Carrie." 
</P>
<P>
"I read the script and thought it was a piece of . . . ," Laurie said, 
laughing. She told her now ex-husband the only way she thought it would work is 
if she played it as a satire. "He said, 'You know, De Palma has a comedic 
approach, maybe it's suppose to be that way.' " 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't. "Sissy and I were rehearsing a scene," she said. "I worked out 
this piece of business in a dramatic moment and Brian said, 'Wait a minute, 
Piper, you can't do that. You are going to get a laugh.' 
</P>
<P>
"I stopped," said Laurie. "I had planned it for a laugh. I realized he didn't 
mean for it to be funny. He has a comedic sensibility that surrounds him, but 
that's not what I was suppose to be. But I really did't change my approach very 
much, and I still think I was funny in it."

SCHOOL OFFICIAL'S STATEMENTS OFFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a teacher, I was offended by the statements made by Norman Guith, the new 
superintendent of the Orange Unified School District ("Orange Schools Chief 
Hopes to Heal District's Ills," July 15). I wish my colleagues in Orange 
success, but I don't hold out a lot of hope for wonderful changes from an 
administrator who obviously considers teachers a minor part of the educational 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting Mr. Guith, "We didn't build these schools to give teachers a place to 
have a job in, we built them for children to learn in." (I hope the teachers in 
"these" classrooms know how to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition 
whenever possible.) 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what is Mr. Guith suggesting? Is he suggesting that if we placed 
children in "these" classrooms without teachers they would learn what Orange 
Unified has adopted as prescribed curriculum? 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside County superintendent stated that Mr. Guith is not afraid of 
surrounding himself with excellent administrators. Is he equally as willing to 
surround himself with excellent teachers? 
</P>
<P>
"This district has entered into a contract with its retirees, and we have to 
honor that contract -- it's the honorable thing to do; it's the gentlemanly 
thing to do." I believe, Mr. Guith, it's also the legal thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come into this district to let it go bankrupt." That's very 
interesting, Mr. Guith. As a veteran teacher of 33 years, your salary is 2.61 
times mine. Explained another way, my wife and I have a total of 60 years of 
teaching between us, and your salary package is about $27,000 more than our 
combined salary. If Orange Unified does go bankrupt, the blame, I'm sure, can 
be shared by all employees. Unlike in a big corporation, Mr. Guith is not 
working to increase profits at Orange Unified; his source comes from the same 
public funds as the salary of my wife and me.

OWNING UP TO FATAL ERROR TOOK A WHILE; 
</P>
<P>
PATIENT DIED AFTER RECEIVING WRONG MEDICINE, BUT NURSE GOT A CLEAN BILL OF 
HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do you tell the family of a terminally ill cancer patient whose death 
later turns out to be the result of a medication error? 
</P>
<P>
FHP Hospital in Fountain Valley is faced with some good questions in just such 
a case, not only from the family but from state investigators. Moreover, there 
are troubling dimensions to the case about the evaluation and licensing of a 
nurse who hospital officials say mistakenly grabbed the wrong bottle off a 
shelf. 
</P>
<P>
Francis J. Johnson, a Garden Grove woman suffering from breast cancer, died in 
November after a nurse, identified recently by the hospital as Maureen Daubert, 
administered a lethal dose of potassium chloride. The hospital now says it 
fired the nurse but owned up to the nursing error only recently, after 
conducting its own investigation and expressing uncertainty publicly about the 
cause of death for some time. 
</P>
<P>
But a hospital vice president, in acknowledging only recently that the nurse 
had quickly realized her error and tried to revive the patient, seemed to 
confirm the strong probability that some kind of cover-up might have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
After all, how much uncertainty could there have been, given the facts, and why 
did it take so long for the hospital to come clean? 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a hospital physician had signed the original death certificate, 
attributing Johnson's death to her cancer. It obviously was a misleading 
statement that resulted in the postponement of a crucial coroner's 
investigation into an accidental death -- which would have been required under 
the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office only recently was able to formally amend the death 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was this astonishing development: Although the hospital says it 
fired Daubert in November after the death, she received a favorable evaluation 
for a period as recently as April. 
</P>
<P>
Because no formal accusations were filed against her, her California nurse's 
license was listed as "clear," thus enabling her to get a job at the Veterans 
Administration Medical Center in Lebanon, Pa., where she found work in May. 
</P>
<P>
Because of FHP's tardiness in owning up to the accidental death, the California 
Board of Registered Nursing has been delayed in its investigation of the nurse. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital, by signing off on an erroneous death certificate, may have put 
off its day of accounting. However, it succeeded in raising some troubling 
questions that now must await the findings of state investigators.

BEING A 'CONSERVATIVE' DOESN'T MEAN LACK OF FEELING OR CARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must take issue with Costa Mesa City Councilman Orville Amburgey's recent 
characterization of my decision to allow charities and social services funded 
by Community Development Block Grants to continue their vital work of trying to 
help people in our communities as "not conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Conservative, in my view, is not a synonym for lack of feeling or caring, nor 
should conservative be anti-immigrant or anti-human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Quite the contrary, I believe a philosophical conservative can work for 
progress, change, reform and helping people help themselves in the tradition of 
Jefferson, Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
As President Bush reminds us, a "kinder, gentler" America is not inconsistent 
with working on policies -- such as the free trade zone agreement with 
President Oscar Salinas de Gortari -- which will benefit both Mexico and 
California -- indeed, all of America. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants do not come to America for welfare, they come here to seek 
opportunity and a better life for themselves and their children. While a 
country has a right -- and a duty -- to control immigration at its borders, it 
would be a sorry commentary on our society if we started dividing people in our 
own communities into "us" versus "them" in order to deny "them" even necessary 
emergency services, shelter or food. Such an approach can lead only to racial 
stereotyping and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Social service agencies are granted federal funds to deliver community 
services. They need to spend their time helping people, not turning themselves 
into mini-bureaucracies or immigration departments. 
</P>
<P>
I would also like to point out to Mr. Amburgey that names like San Diego, Los 
Angeles and Costa Mesa should serve as powerful reminders that newcomers to 
Southern California have always come from the south, not just the east. Those 
who have been blessed by this land should attempt to be a blessing to others.

LAGUNA NIGUEL BAN WAS THE RIGHT MOVE; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDING MUST HALT UNTIL PARKLAND TRANSFER IS SOLVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The novice Laguna Niguel City Council showed that it could make a tough 
decision last week when it voted to impose a moratorium on further construction 
of homes on a disputed portion of the Marina Hills development. 
</P>
<P>
A moratorium is essential to preserve the status quo until it is clear how 96 
acres of land intended for open space ended up in the hands of a developer, 
Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd. Nothing can be done about the 100 homes 
that have been built on the land, but the dozens more that are planned 
shouldn't be constructed unless all questions have been answered regarding this 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the moratorium, the council decided to file suit for possible damages 
against Taylor Woodrow -- a signal likely to reassure residents that it takes 
this troubling matter seriously. It is proper that the district attorney is 
conducting a criminal investigation of the mysterious transfer. 
</P>
<P>
This much we know: The land in question, which borders on Salt Creek Corridor 
Regional Park and is estimated to be worth $40 million to $70 million, was 
transferred to Taylor Woodrow in 1988, two years before the city's 
incorporation. James F. Krembas -- now a Laguna Niguel city councilman -- 
quitclaimed the acreage to Taylor Woodrow. Krembas was acting as a member of 
the county's Laguna Niguel Community Services District, which was set up 
pending cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Krembas has denied impropriety, saying he was deceived by Taylor Woodrow into 
thinking he was authorizing another agreement entirely. His credibility has not 
been helped, however, by the fact that his wife was hired by Taylor Woodrow 
three months after the land swap took place. Krembas last week wisely abstained 
from the council's decisions, which included a request for an investigation of 
the actions of two other board officials -- James S. Okazaki, then the district 
board's attorney, and James S. Mocalis, the chief executive of that board -- 
who were involved in the deed transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow says Krembas was merely completing a land transfer that 
previously had been approved by the county in return for a park and ball fields 
in another part of what was then unincorporated county land. There certainly 
appears to have been some fumbling on the part of the county planning staff 
that was charged with overseeing the area, pending cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
What can be said at this point is that many people dropped the ball. That even 
may include Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes the Marina 
Hills development and who should have been looking carefully at any large land 
transfers as Laguna Niguel approached cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
It may turn out, as Krembas has said, that the transfer was an unfortunate 
mistake. But no more development must take place until all legal proceedings 
have been completed. To do otherwise would be to risk compounding the error. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, in deciding to file suit against Taylor Woodrow, said it is 
not interested in calling into question the property rights of those who have 
purchased homes that are already in place. But the undeveloped home sites are 
another matter. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow President Gordon Tippell, appearing before the City Council last 
week, called a Marina Hills moratorium and lawsuit "drastic" measures and 
pleaded with the council to hold off. 
</P>
<P>
To its credit, the members correctly moved decisively instead to attempt to 
find out how valuable open space was forfeited to a private developer and to 
seek amends for area residents.

DEVELOPING VACANT LAND IN LAGUNA NIGUEL, LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a godsend to read in the newspaper earlier this month of the details of 
the Richard King Mellon Foundation's rescue and subsequent donation to the 
federal government of several wildlife refuges and historic sites for 
preservation in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
The Mellon Foundation president said the foundation hoped its gift would 
inspire others to buy and preserve properties. 
</P>
<P>
May the Richard King Mellon Foundation indeed be a trend setter and an 
inspiration to all of us! Listen up, Donald Bren! 
</P>
<P>
I cannot think of an area more in need of inspiration and tender loving care 
than Orange County. The people in my hometown, Laguna Beach, truly appreciate 
beauty and nature and tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
But we, alas, are now well into the third decade of our struggle to save Laguna 
Canyon from the jaws of the bulldozers of the mighty Irvine Co. Unfortunately, 
the amount of money we can raise by taxing our residents $100 a year for 20 
years cannot begin to satisfy the landowner. 
</P>
<P>
I say, Donald Bren, give us a break! Isn't it feasible, reasonable and 
appropriate for the Irvine Co. to donate Laguna Canyon to the City of Laguna 
Beach? Isn't it time to help save the habitat and natural environment that has 
been so wantonly exploited and overdeveloped?

DEVELOPING VACANT LAND IN LAGUNA NIGUEL, LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Laguna Beach argued before the California Coastal Commission that 
it was OK to develop and fill in 3 1/2 acres of the Laguna Greenbelt because it 
was only a little bit and because we had so much open space. Incredibly, the 
commissioners were persuaded by the argument! 
</P>
<P>
Opponents to the proposed Alta Laguna Sports Complex displayed slides of aerial 
photographs that dramatically showed the scar that the present five-acre graded 
park site has inflicted upon the beautiful, pristine open space. However, a 
number of the "swing vote" commissioners noted that the pictures showed how 
vast the Laguna Greenbelt was and that developing a little bit wouldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
This concerns me greatly regarding all the efforts to acquire the Irvine Co.'s 
Laguna Laurel acreage. The Irvine Co. has plans to build a 3,200-house 
development in Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
I believe it is essential to stop this development and to acquire the land and 
keep it natural for all future generations. It is most important for all our 
citizens' quality of life to have refuge from the urban sprawl that is 
engulfing us. 
</P>
<P>
But why bother acquiring the open space if projects will come up in the future 
to develop it, perhaps on a piecemeal basis? It is essential that as we are 
successful in acquiring this property, provisions are made to prevent 
development in the newly acquired open space in the future. 
</P>
<P>
If we acquire Laguna Laurel, developers will have even a stronger argument that 
"developing a little won't hurt" as we will have even more open space. We need 
to ensure that developing our open space can only occur by a vote of the 
people. Laguna Beach should have the Open Space Element of the General Plan 
ratified by the people in November with the proviso that no portion could be 
sold off or developed without the voters' concurrence.

WHY RUSH TO VEGAS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Am I missing something, somewhere, along the way? Admittedly, there are a lot 
of projects under way these days that I don't understand. Some of them are 
highly technical, and thus are beyond me. 
</P>
<P>
But there is one basically simple one that is nonetheless beyond my 
comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
Will somebody please tell me: What is the burning need -- or for that matter, 
any need at all -- for a high-speed rail line between Anaheim and Las Vegas? 
</P>
<P>
With so many really worthy projects that could better use the money, I have to 
ask: Who needs to get from Anaheim to Las Vegas -- or back -- in a hurry? For 
what reason? And if it's that important, why can't they do it by air?

WHEN AIRPORT FACES OVERRUNS, TAXPAYER PICKS UP TAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been reading recently about the cost overruns, funding losses and 
lawsuits pending over the expansion of John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
This seems to be a result of a new form of government, a government in which 
cost is not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
A decision is made to do something, build an airport or a freeway, and the 
taxpayer is expected to approve such a development on preliminary and, in 
hindsight, woefully inadequate data. 
</P>
<P>
The taxpayer, the apparently limitless source of funds, is then expected to 
assume payment for the overrides, on the principle of having started the 
project the public entity in charge can't stop -- that would waste the 
taxpayer's money! It also would leave unfinished a monument to a public 
"leader." 
</P>
<P>
This attitude on the part of elected officials is so prevalent that I feel it 
is standard operating procedure. First they find a project to satisfy their 
megalomania, and, by quoting a cheap cost, they gain taxpayer approval. Then to 
get it finished and satisfy their ego, they sock us for the cost overruns. 
Meanwhile, we have been disenfranchised and are sheared like sheep. 
</P>
<P>
In the specific case of the John Wayne Airport, we were certainly deceived as 
to cost and as to what it would look like finished. When are we going to stop 
egocentric politicians from wasting our tax dollars this way? I may be naive, 
but I assume the politician is supposed to watch out for the taxpayer's 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Voters, it is time that we stop letting our officials waste our tax dollars. 
Let's hold them accountable. 
</P>
<P>
For every bond issue, independent feasibility studies and cost estimates should 
be done and the data provided to the voters. When voters approve a project, it 
should be clear that the approved bond issue is the limit of the taxpayer's 
responsibility. If the politicians need to return to us for more money, they 
automatically should be required to resign. 
</P>
<P>
To promote a specific project, like the airport as originally proposed, and 
then raise the cost and cut back on the project smacks of malfeasance.

TERMITES TURN HOME INTO HOUSE OF HORRORS WHILE FAMILY AWAITS COURT'S RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE BOYER, Boyer is a Riverside free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month, the Real Estate section ran a three-part series on termites in 
Southern California. The story that follows, which outlines the problems of an 
extreme case of infestation, was brought to our attention as a result of that 
series. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peggy Rose and her husband, Harvey, thought they had found their dream house 
three years ago in Simi Valley. The roomy home at the end of a cul-de-sac had a 
view of nearby mountains and a big back yard for their two sons to play in. 
</P>
<P>
Now their dream house is giving them nightmares -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy and Harvey Rose and their children have frequent nightmares about bugs 
coming out of the walls and crawling over their beds. 
</P>
<P>
The Roses' house is so badly infested with termites that at least part of it 
must be razed and rebuilt, according to repair estimates, Peggy Rose said. One 
contractor said it would cost less to tear it down and start over than to fix 
the problems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Termite damage inside the home is easily visible, with holes dotting several 
walls. A subterranean termite tube built from mud, saliva and feces snakes 
nearly a foot down the sun room wall. 
</P>
<P>
If you stand near a severely damaged living room wall, the paneling wavy and 
pockmarked with termite holes, you can hear a slight crackling, rustling sound 
that Rose said is the termites at work. The insects make a noise by bumping 
their heads against tunnels in the wood, entomologists said. 
</P>
<P>
Underneath the home, a joist has a jagged chunk missing, as though someone had 
taken a big bite out of it. More mud tubes rise from the soil to the home's 
underpinnings. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Rose said she notices new holes every day, along with a musty smell that 
seems to come from under the house. The termites are building more mud tubes on 
inside walls. 
</P>
<P>
The Roses haven't had the termites exterminated and the damage repaired because 
they are embroiled in a legal battle over who is responsible for the problem. 
</P>
<P>
These are the previous owners of the home, two exterminators who treated the 
house for termites and the realty companies involved in the purchase. The Roses 
allege that the damage is a result of fraud by some, breach of contract and 
negligence by others. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose case, while more extreme than most, demonstrates how vulnerable home 
buyers are when relying on a termite inspection, and how important it is to 
check such reports as much as possible. Trouble can result for others involved 
as well if a report is questioned later. 
</P>
<P>
It also shows how difficult it can be to resolve a complex problem with the 
system of termite inspection and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"This could happen to anybody in Southern California," Peggy Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Roses bought their "dream house" in 1987, they did what most people do 
-- included a termite report and repair work as part of their purchase 
agreement. They bought the house believing everything was fixed. 
</P>
<P>
The couple first noticed a problem about 18 months after moving in, when they 
saw insect holes on a living room wall, Peggy Rose said. They had been having 
Western Exterminator Co.'s Oxnard office spray monthly for other pests and 
asked them take care of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Western sent an inspector who reported finding subterranean termites (a type 
that lives in the soil and tunnels up to food sources) in the wall. 
</P>
<P>
He recommended drilling through the outside wall and applying a pesticide. This 
was done March 16, 1989, according to a copy of the inspection report filed 
with the state Structural Pest Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
The report also notes that other areas of the house, such as the attic, garage 
and foundation were not inspected. The Roses paid for a complete inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the March 16 treatment, the Roses noticed termite debris in the 
home's attached garage. Western was called again, and in an inspection report 
dated April 4, 1989, discovered a different type of termite -- drywood. 
(Drywood termites live in the wood itself.) Western treated the garage termites 
with a local pesticide application. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1989, the Roses again called Western to examine holes in their bedroom 
and adjoining sun room. They were told it was subterranean termite damage and a 
local treatment was recommended. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, they had doubts about Western's judgment, Peggy Rose said, and 
called another exterminator, M&amp;M Termite &amp; Pest Control Inc. of Newbury 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
When they saw M&amp;M's report, listing numerous problems throughout the house, 
"we had to be picked up from the floor," Peggy Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
M&amp;M found both types of termites in the attic and substructure, drywoods in 
the garage and subterraneans in various spots, including the master bedroom, 
living room, floor and floor joists in certain areas, foundation and behind the 
water heater. 
</P>
<P>
Poor ventilation, earth-to-wood contact and cellulose debris under the house 
were among the discoveries, along with a leaky shower and other moisture 
problems -- all of which attract termites. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations included fumigation for drywood termites and drilling holes 
every five feet in the foundation and injecting chemicals for subterranean 
termites. Damaged sections of floor and other wood needed replacing. The report 
also suggested tearing open sections of floor and removing the shower so that 
inaccessible areas could be inspected, and getting rid of soil and debris under 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
M&amp;M, who the Roses are not suing, told them to complain to the pest control 
board because areas that had been treated before were still infested, the Roses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After they filed a complaint with the board, a state investigator examined 
their home. He told them the termites had started chomping several years before 
they had bought the house, judging by the amount of damage, Peggy Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
The Roses said they were shocked because a Simi Valley company, Pacific Coast 
Exterminating Co. Inc., had treated the house for termites as part of the 
purchase agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In his official findings in the Rose case, the investigator held Pacific Coast 
and Western each 50% responsible for seven violations where they failed to 
report problems, and Western 100% responsible for four other violations, 
according to a copy of a September, 1989, letter provided by Western's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Board officials refused to discuss the Rose case because it is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Western, one of California's largest exterminators, with more than 20 offices, 
accepts the state's findings and is offering to take care of its share of the 
problem, said its attorney, Arthur B. Cook. The worker who inspected the home 
has been fired, he said. The company also offered to reimburse the Roses for 
their inspection and treatment fees. 
</P>
<P>
However, Western does not think it is fair for the company to pay for damage 
that took place before it was hired, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
The Roses said Western's offer fell far short of what was needed for repairs, 
and negotiations faltered. The Roses finally felt that the only way to get 
their home restored was to sue Western and the others, which they did in April 
in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The Roses' attorney, Eric Chomsky, said that if Western had discovered the 
extent of the problem in its original March, 1989, inspection, most of the 
damage could have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
He likens the situation to a person who has cancer and is misdiagnosed by two 
doctors. Both are liable for malpractice, he said, and they can't claim 
responsibility for only half of the patient's body. 
</P>
<P>
When the suit was filed, repair costs were estimated at more than $90,000, and 
growing. Later Chomsky asked Western to either buy the Roses' house for 
$750,000 or pay them $250,000 in cash (with partial reimbursement if the Roses 
collected from other defendants). That offer had been withdrawn, because the 
latest estimate shows it would take at least $300,000 to rebuild the house, 
plus the legal and other costs, Chomsky said. The Roses paid $318,000 for the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Western offered to make or co-sign a loan so the Roses could afford to fix 
their home now instead of waiting for the dispute to end. The loan would not 
affect anyone's legal position in the case, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Roses don't want the financial burden shifted to them with a loan, 
Chomsky said, because it isn't their fault the house is damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The Roses are also suing the original exterminator, Pacific Coast, and its 
president, Michael Venarde, alleging fraud and negligence. They accuse him of 
falsely certifying it was free of active infestation. Venarde did not return 
calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Structural Pest Control Board last month asked the state attorney general 
for a hearing to suspend or revoke Pacific Coast's registration and Venarde's 
liscence. The board also asked that Pacific Coast be required to pay fees owed 
to the board and restitution to the Roses. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Venarde had told the previous owners, Michael and Adele 
Gruett, that the home would never be free of termites. The Roses are suing the 
Gruetts as well, charging them with fraud and breach of contract. The Gruetts 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The other defendants are Century 21 Finley Realty of Simi Valley, the sellers' 
broker, and Century 21 Ambassador Realty of Thousand Oaks, the Roses' broker. 
</P>
<P>
The Roses allege both brokers dissuaded them from obtaining other inspection 
reports and misled them into accepting Pacific Coast's report and completion 
notice as accurate so that they could get their commissions on the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Century 21 Finley referred inquiries to its lawyer, who did not return phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
The owner-broker of Century 21 Ambassador, Robert Majorino, denied that his 
office did anything wrong. He said two termite inspections were done on the 
house -- one by Pacific Coast and a follow-up check by another company -- and 
both showed similar findings. Pacific Coast, which submitted a higher estimate 
for the extermination and treatment, was selected and paid by the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Coast filed the state-required completion notice, certifying that the 
property was free of active termite infestation in accessible areas. It treated 
the house with chemicals and repaired several areas, including a damaged floor 
joist, according to a copy of the August, 1987, notice attached to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
However, it also shows two recommendations not done -- remove cellulose debris 
and correct earth-to-wood contact in certain areas. Both conditions attract 
termites. 
</P>
<P>
The Roses' agent, Ray Gebeau, said he doesn't remember why those items were 
skipped, but such preventive measures as described in the report don't have to 
be done, Majorino said. 
</P>
<P>
The state does not require that recommendations be completed, but lenders will 
usually insist that any needed corrective work be done so that a home is free 
of termites. Buyers also often make it a condition of purchase, as the Roses 
did. 
</P>
<P>
However, with preventive recommendations, the parties involved sometimes choose 
not to do the work or to do it later, Gebeau said. 
</P>
<P>
It's unclear if anything was done after the August notice, but similar problems 
appear on later inspection reports. 
</P>
<P>
The Roses said they don't know why some recommendations weren't done. They were 
told the house would be free of termites, and everything would be taken care of 
by the time escrow closed, Harvey Rose, 38, said. 
</P>
<P>
If they had known the structure had a serious infestation they never would have 
bought it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the termites are eating more and more of their home. The Roses have 
taken pictures off the walls to keep the termites from chewing on them. They're 
treading cautiously over the weak spots in the floor. 
</P>
<P>
And they're getting angrier all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Originally she only wanted her home restored to its previous condition, Peggy 
Rose said, and expenses paid when the family moved out for repairs. Now legal 
fees, medical bills and emotional distress are added to those costs. 
</P>
<P>
Having their home resemble a horror movie set has "put my family through hell," 
Peggy Rose, 37, said. The stress has strained her 16-year marriage and given 
the family nightmares along with severe headaches and stomachaches, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Roses are afraid that by the time the case is settled there won't be much 
left of their house. They said the pest control board has been responsive to 
their plight, but its powers are limited. The board can discipline 
exterminators and order them to re-treat if their original work was faulty, but 
it can't guarantee restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the house is repaired or rebuilt, the Roses aren't sure they still want 
to live there. But they're worried that the property would be hard to sell with 
its record of termite trouble. And as much as they long to leave the experience 
behind them, they also dread going through the process of buying another house. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gun-shy," Peggy Rose said.

CALIFORNIA TRENDS: RISE IN HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION WOES PROMPTS STATE ACTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Sheila Newsome closes escrow on her new house in Long Beach this month, 
she will also purchase a stake in a corporation that can be held liable for her 
personal safety, that can foreclose on her property and that can tell her what 
color her new home can be painted. 
</P>
<P>
Newsome is a new homeowner and also a first-time member of a residential 
community association, a legal entity that manages and polices the affairs of 
her development and yields consider able clout over how people live together. 
</P>
<P>
The growing influence of community associations in California has prompted the 
state Legislature to convene the Select Committee on Common Interest 
Subdivisions, chaired by Assemblyman Dan Hawser (D-Arcata). Among other things, 
the special committee is expected to consider whether a proliferation of 
lawsuits and community association-related complaints justifies establishing a 
state agency to regulate associations. The committee will hold hearings 
beginning July 31. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 3 million Californians belong to residential 
community associations, with nearly half located in single-family subdivisions. 
They represent a radical transformation in the ownership of private property in 
the state and have revolutionized how our communities are governed. 
</P>
<P>
Once a new residential development is completed, associations are legally 
organized as mutual benefit corporations. With a volunteer board of directors 
and a paid staff or professional management firm, they collect dues and 
maintain common areas, such as open space, streets, swimming pools, corridors 
and playgrounds. Associations also enforce the property's covenants and deed 
restrictions, which may include rules on loud music, design standards and how a 
lawn must be landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
Home buyers automatically become members of the association and must abide by 
the rules. When a homeowner consistently violates the bylaws, such as 
nonpayment of dues, an association can place a lien on the property and even 
execute foreclosure proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"People think that they know what owning a house is all about, but they don't, 
because this is a radical departure from ownership as we have known it in the 
past," said UC Berkeley research associate Carol Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
Expensive and complex legal brawls and consumer complaints have prompted the 
Legislature to look into community associations. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco homeowner Suzanne Sarra's gripe is a familiar one. She lives in a 
small condominium complex where a lawsuit between her homeowners association 
and the developer has held up home sales and hurt property values. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very frustrating experience; we are a small association 
without a lot of reliable information," she said. "There should be some sort of 
government agency to help. We didn't know what to do, so we hired an attorney, 
which hasn't been cheap." 
</P>
<P>
The number of appellate court decisions related to community associations 
tripled between 1988 and 1989, according professor Katharine Rosenberry of the 
California Western School of Law in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Phase 1 in the evolution (of community associations) is building all of these 
projects and getting people to live in them," Rosenberry said. "And now for 
Phase 2, when neighbors must learn to live with another and they begin to 
disagree and they begin to sue." 
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of associations accounts for the increased number of 
conflicts that have come to the attention of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In California, 18,000 subdivisions and townhome and condominium projects have 
associations with collective operating budgets that exceed $1 billion. It is 
estimated that 70% of all new for-sale developments in the state that have more 
than four units are organized with community associations. 
</P>
<P>
Residential associations date back to 1743, when the Earl of Leicester 
constructed townhomes surrounding a public square. Residents set up a legal 
device to maintain the area so that they could have exclusive use of the 
square. 
</P>
<P>
After World War I, residential associations in the United States were used to 
enforce restrictive covenants that prohibited racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the first community association was founded in 1912 when the St. 
Francis Wood single-family subdivision was built in San Francisco. But it 
wasn't until after the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 that the number of 
associations mushroomed. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, community associations governed fewer than 200 developments 
throughout the state, and the vast majority of those were upscale condominiums 
and townhome developments. 
</P>
<P>
"The fiscal problems of local government following the enact ment of 
Proposition 13 accelerated the use of associations," according Silverman. "By 
requiring the developer to provide streets, street lighting, visitor parking, 
water and sewer lines, parks and playgrounds, localities can minimize the 
fiscal impact of new development," Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
Once these common amenities are built, the developer sets up a community 
association to maintain them. Not only have associations assumed 
responsibilities traditionally provided by local government, but they tackle 
broader duties. 
</P>
<P>
For example, an association has unique responsibilities to safeguard its 
residents. In the California Supreme Court case of Frances T. vs. the Village 
Green Owners Assn., a Los Angeles woman won a lawsuit against a homeowners 
association because it failed to provide adequate outdoor lighting that might 
have prevented the woman's rape. 
</P>
<P>
"A city doesn't have the (legal) responsibility to protect you against crime, 
but here we have a case that says a homeowners association can be held 
negligent for the same thing," Rosenberry said. 
</P>
<P>
In other instances, associations have become a crutch for solving neighborhood 
spats. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we had associations policing illegally parked cars and shoddy 
landscaping, these problems were worked out neighbor to neighbor," Rosenberry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some experts say it is time to establish a consumer-oriented 
regulatory agency to protect homeowners from abuses and to offer information 
and redress for people who feel victimized by community associations or 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
"After the developer completes the project, there is no regulatory oversight," 
Silverman said. "It makes sense to have an agency that would protect the 
consumer." 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Real Estate works with the developer to set up the 
association, but the state agency washes its hands after it is established. 
</P>
<P>
Silverman points to the Bureau of Condominiums in Florida, which is a 
government regulatory body funded by fees from developers and homeowners. Such 
an agency can offer mediation services in legal disputes, oversee the election 
of association officers, require the licensing of association property managers 
and provide consumer education. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's set up to offer the homeowner better information and to regulate the 
people that are hired to run these organizations, then it's a good idea," 
Rosenberry said. "But if it's set up to resolve disputes over barking dogs, it 
will be a waste of taxpayers' money."

HOT PROPERTY: CHER'S NEW HOME: ONLY TEMPORARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHER, who has been giving concerts from Boston to San Diego during the last 
couple of months, found time during her tour to buy a new $4-million house in 
Malibu, which she plans to use as her main residence until a mansion that she 
is having built nearby is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The actress/singer is planning to build a house that a real estate source said 
will be "a sprawling, walled fortress, like something you would see coming out 
of the Arabian desert." 
</P>
<P>
Planned on 1.72 acres that she purchased last year near Pepperdine University, 
the ocean-view mansion is expected to be more than 15,000 square feet. It will 
replace a 40-year-old hacienda and some corrals that are now on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Cher sold her 10,000-square-foot-plus home, with Egyptian decor, in Benedict 
Canyon about 18 months ago to actor/comedian Eddie Murphy for about $6.3 
million, including some of her furnishings. She built that home 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story home that she just purchased was built on slightly more than an 
acre in the Point Dume area. It is a Mediterranean-style house with five 
bedrooms, a step-down living room and marble fireplaces and flooring in about 
5,200 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
It also has an ocean view, tennis court, tennis pavilion and a waterfall that 
feeds a spa and a terraced swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
When telephoned, Ron Wilson, Cher's interior designer, said: "In the house that 
she just purchased, we will do another extension of what Cher enjoys calling 
her 'futuristic prehistoric' style, which is a very textured, monochromatic 
approach to the interiors, using a lot of stone, precast concrete and natural 
materials." The exterior is white. 
</P>
<P>
Cher had been renting in Malibu since last fall, when she moved from a rental 
on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
STEPHANIE EDWARDS, the red-haired TV spokeswoman for Lucky Stores who co-hosted 
the 1990 Pasadena Rose Parade with Bob Eubanks and hosted Channel 9's recently 
canceled "L.A. in the Morning," and her husband, actor MURRAY MacLEOD, have 
decided to remodel in Santa Monica rather than build in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
They're fixing up their longtime house near the beach and have put the Bel-Air 
property that they purchased for their dream house on the market at $1,525,000 
with Micheline Swift at Fred Sands Estates, Beverly Hills. The property, a bit 
less than an acre with a three-bedroom fixer-upper on it, has city and ocean 
views. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills house where JOSE MENENDEZ and his wife, KITTY, were murdered 
last August has been leased by a Saudi prince for two or three months at 
$40,000 a month, real estate sources say. 
</P>
<P>
The house, which some realtors are calling "Nightmare on Elm Street" because of 
the killings that occurred there, was put on the market in June at $5.95 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hardly listed when a doctor made an offer on it, but that deal fell 
through," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
Songwriters JOHN TRIVERS and ELIZABETH MYERS have just moved into a 
$1.25-million home they had built on The Strand in Hermosa Beach. They call 
their new home the "New York Loft by the California Sea." 
</P>
<P>
The musicians, who met while playing in the pit orchestra of the Broadway 
production of "Grease," lived in an industrial space in the Park Avenue South 
section of New York City before moving West. The industrial space had been a 
sewing-machine factory and then a dance studio before it became their home. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to re-create that loft feeling," Myers said through his spokesman, 
Steve Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Appel, the Playa del Rey architect who built the strikingly contemporary 
Manhattan Beach house featured in the movie "Against All Odds," designed the 
Hermosa Beach home, which Goldberg described as "high-tech." The nearly 
3,000-square-foot home has four baths and three bedrooms, including a master 
suite that overlooks the ocean and has a fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
The living and dining areas are in one large room with exposed, red steel 
I-beams and a two-story atrium. An upstairs music room has hardwood floors, a 
vaulted ceiling, 12-foot-long skylight and mitered windows with a panoramic 
ocean view. It was designed especially for Myers' grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
Myers and Trivers created the musical theme for the "CBS Evening News," 
Goldberg said, and Myers co-wrote the hit "Shakin' " with Eddie Money and 
orchestrated ballets for Agnes de Mille and the Joffrey Ballet. Trivers wrote 
songs for Blue Oyster Cult and played bass on the "We Are the World" LP with 
Tina Turner, Goldberg added. 
</P>
<P>
Sculptor ERWIN BINDER, who counts Johnny Carson and Bob Hope among his dozens 
of famous collectors, has put his estate in Los Feliz Hills, just below the 
Griffith Park Observatory, on the market at $895,000. 
</P>
<P>
Binder has owned the three-bedroom, three-bath villa with guest 
apartment/maid's quarters, patios, loggias and gardens for about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to sell the nearly 3,000-square-foot home, built in 1926, because he 
wants a larger residence where he can create larger sculptures, said Bruce Jay, 
broker/co-founder of Bruce George Associates, who has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking in the San Fernando Valley, because there is more land there," 
Jay said. 
</P>
<P>
Binder, who is listed in "Who's Who in American Art," has created a number of 
major pieces, including the controversial, 12-foot war memorial "Requiem" in 
Burbank.

CONSUMER NOTEBOOK: IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECORD REAL ESTATE DEALS; 
</P>
<P>
DOCUMENTS: FOLLOWING THE PROPER PROCEDURES CAN PROTECT AN OWNER FROM FINANCIAL 
LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a San Francisco-based syndicated real estate 
columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A surprisingly large number of real estate documents remain unrecorded, usually 
due to ignorance. Failure to record a deed, mortgage or other realty document 
can cause unnecessary but often huge financial losses. 
</P>
<P>
For example, home buyers sometimes don't record their deeds for fear the lender 
will call the low interest rate mortgage if it is not assumable, the property 
will be reassessed to raise the property tax, or that a pre-existing judgment 
or income tax lien will attach to the property. 
</P>
<P>
These may seem like valid reasons for not recording a deed, but the buyer 
should be aware (1) an unscrupulous seller might sell the same property to 
another buyer who records his deed first, (2) the seller could incur income tax 
or judgment liens that will attach to the property, or worse yet, (3) the 
seller might file bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
When a lender such as a home seller who is helping to finance the sale receives 
a mortgage and fails to record the deed, the lender could only look to the 
borrower and not to the property for repayment. 
</P>
<P>
Documents are recorded with the county recorder of deeds to give constructive 
notice of the contents of the documents. Any person dealing with real estate is 
presumed to know of the recorded papers affecting a specific property, such as 
deeds, mortgages, liens and judgments. 
</P>
<P>
By searching the public records, anyone can determine who owns a property and 
what liens or other encumbrances affect the title. Many counties now have 
computerized records. 
</P>
<P>
The basic recording rule is "first in time is first in right." This means that 
the first recorded document has priority over a later recorded document, even 
if the second document to be recorded was executed earlier than the first 
document recorded. 
</P>
<P>
This priority of recording can be very critical. Suppose you loan a homeowner 
$10,000 secured by what you thought would be a second mortgage on the house. 
But the homeowner then borrows $20,000 from another lender, who immediately 
records his mortgage before you record yours. The $20,000 lender would have a 
second mortgage and because you delayed recording, you would have a third 
mortgage securing your $10,000 loan. Even a one-minute difference can be 
critical to determining the priority of a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually any document affecting real estate is eligible for recording if it is 
properly notarized. Deeds, mortgages, trust deeds, leases, purchase options, 
land contracts and purchase agreements are a few examples of documents eligible 
for recording. My neighbor and I recently signed a notarized "fence agreement," 
which she can record. 
</P>
<P>
But improper recording of a document against a property creates a "title 
cloud," which may give rise to a lawsuit for damages due to "slander of title," 
a serious offense. For example, if a mortgage lender mistakenly records a 
mortgage against your house instead of the one next door, that would be slander 
of your title. 
</P>
<P>
An unusual type of recordable document is a lis pendens, which is recorded 
against a property when litigation involving its title has been filed. The lis 
pendens simply warns any buyer or lender that the property title is in 
litigation and that anyone dealing with the property does so subject to the 
outcome of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"Wild documents" are recorded documents that usually contain an error, thus 
placing them outside the chain of title. For example, suppose Smith owns a 
property but buyer Jones records a deed to him from seller Thompson. This is a 
wild document because no deed was recorded from Smith to Thompson. Although 
such a deed from Smith to Thompson may exist, if it was not recorded, it gave 
no constructive notice, so the deed to Smith is a wild document outside the 
chain of title. 
</P>
<P>
Most property buyers and sellers don't worry about the recording laws. Whenever 
they acquire a property, they make certain they receive an owner's title 
insurance policy. Then if there is a recording error, the title insurer will 
pay for correcting the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Without title insurance, property titles would be in chaos. Especially when 
acquiring property from friends and relatives, title insurance is vital to be 
certain there are no unexpected liens or encumbrances. Not only does title 
insurance insure the document as it was represented, but unexpected title risks 
such as forged signatures, rights of ex-spouses, claims by missing heirs, title 
claims by minors and incompetent persons, and improperly recorded instruments 
also are insured. Further information on recording laws is available from a 
local real estate attorney or title insurance officer.

CONDO VS. TOWNHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an appraiser, I know I'm not the only one who finds some of Robert J. Bruss' 
opinions annoying and somewhat self-serving. But, when he gave out 
misinformation in the July 8 column item "Townhouse or Condo: Which Is Wiser 
Buy?" I felt I should write to clear up a common misconception. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between a condominium and a townhouse is that a condominium is a 
type of ownership and a townhouse is a type of architectural style. A 
condominium unit could be a variety of styles, including townhouses. A 
townhouse can be either a condominium or a planned unit development, or PUD. 
</P>
<P>
Condominium ownership is ownership of the airspace of the unit only, along with 
an undivided interest in the land for the entire project, which includes any 
common areas. 
</P>
<P>
PUD ownership includes ownership of the unit, the lot it stands on, and an 
undivided interest in the common area. Condos and PUDs can even be fully 
detached units. In the case of a detached condo, the "unit" is the land around 
and under the building. Since the ownership is of the airspace over this 
particular parcel, the dwelling is included.

MAKING A BIG DEAL ABOUT TOWER'S DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Interstate Tower: Art of the Deal" (July 1), Leon Whiteson complains that 
the design of the Interstate tower was dictated by non-architectural deals and 
trade-offs. The thrust of the article is that this particular building suffers 
from an unusual set of economic and other compromises. 
</P>
<P>
Great architecture is not created by perfect conditions and an unlimited 
budget. First, such conditions do not exist. Secondly, if they did, mediocre 
design would result from those circumstances if mediocre designers were 
employed. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the greatest architecture has been generated by the toughest conditions 
when a great client and talented architect came together. Los Angeles is loaded 
with examples of easy deals and bad buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, corporate architecture sometimes can be superior, but there are only a few 
examples of corporate headquarter buildings in all of Southern California and 
maybe three or four in downtown Los Angeles. The rest are spec office buildings 
designed before an anchor tenant was signed (and the building named for them). 
</P>
<P>
Good buildings rent for higher rates. Bad buildings attract marginal tenants 
who often cannot pay their rent. The shapers of our cities will eventually 
learn this economic truth and demand quality design no matter how many "deals" 
it takes to put the building together. 
</P>
<P>
Maquire Thomas has consistently produced the best-looking and functioning 
buildings in Los Angeles but blaming bad design on "the deal" misdirects our 
attention and lets the developer and architect off the hook.

MAKING A BIG DEAL ABOUT TOWER'S DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leon Whiteson's criticism of the First Interstate tower is simply wrong. Its 
architects have designed an elegant facade without being fussy. 
</P>
<P>
Whiteson laments "inadequate detailing," but a more intricate treatment would 
detract from the serenity of the facade -- which accomplishes a massive task of 
enclosure with grace. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the features Whiteson finds objectionable are examples of good design. 
For example, Whiteson argues that the main lobby entrance (at 5th Street) is 
obscured by the multistory illuminated glass wedges outside its recessed doors. 
These "light fins" are very interesting architectural elements that create a 
sense of both procession and enclosure. They "cloak," which is an appropriate 
and delightful way of entering this obelisk to commerce, far superior to a 
solution that would carry the facade as a solid wall down to ground level. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, the entry at the north (Bunker Hill) side of the tower is weak. It 
may have been preferable to continue the bold south side motif (which Whiteson 
disliked) around the west facade of the building and up to this entrance. This 
would have surrounded the building on its public sides with an ascending screen 
of large forms. 
</P>
<P>
L.A.'s straight gigantic version of the Leaning Tower would have had a crooked 
base if this were done. As it is, however, the humble top-of-the Bunker Hill 
entrance is a nice counterpoint -- like the servants entrance to a very ornate 
mansion. I've always liked back doors. 
</P>
<P>
Out of their constraints, the architects have created a composition of subtle 
elegance. Over time, this building will be recognized as one of the great 
successes of the Postmodern period. Bravo!

BOARD PROVIDES RESEARCH ON PROPERTIES TO BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Structural Pest Control Board regulates pest control operators and 
requires that copies of inspection reports and work completion notices be filed 
with its office. 
</P>
<P>
If home buyers want to research a property, the reports and notices for the 
last two years on any address are available for a $2 search fee. 
</P>
<P>
The pest control board will also tell consumers the number of settled 
complaints an exterminator has had in the last two years, but can't discuss 
pending complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can file complaints about inspections or treatments for up to two 
years afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's typical for sellers to take care of termite work, a lot of 
complaints occur after buyers allow the seller and real estate agents to handle 
it, said Maureen Sharp, deputy registrar. After buyers move in, they are 
dissatisfied with the work and complain. The board recommends that buyers order 
their own termite inspections and consider getting two or three to compare 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
It also suggests getting referrals from satisfied customers when choosing an 
exterminator. 
</P>
<P>
Call the pest control board at (213) 620-2255 or (916) 920-6323 for more 
information, or send inquiries to 1430 Howe Ave., Sacramento, Calif. 95825.

TINY DROPS A LIFELINE FOR TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISABELLE C. GREENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This plea for trees from Santa Barbara landscape architect Isabelle C. Greene, 
addressed specifically to drought-cursed Santa Barbarans, can be taken to heart 
by all who are doing their best to save water. Greene is a granddaughter of 
Henry Greene, one of the brothers who made the bungalow and the Craftsman 
movement almost synonymous with California. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert Smaus 
</P>
<P>
Times Garden Editor 
</P>
<P>
We are all reminded again that we live in a special climate: not like the rainy 
east, nor the steamy tropics, nor humid Japan, nor the short-season Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
The unique beauty around us is derived from the fact that there is hardly an 
overabundance of water in any year and thus no resulting overstatement of plant 
growth, nor vast bodies of water, nor any other manifestations of wet climates. 
</P>
<P>
We have instead rugged mountains sweeping down to the coast; undulating 
foothills and valleys briefly clothed with plants for one brief, ephemeral 
period in the spring. For the rest of our warm season we have a tawny covering 
of standing grasses covering and battening down the soil. There are as well our 
rugged and rich chaparral and stands of live oaks, securely waiting until the 
next rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
This gentle beauty that pervades our land was exactly what drew people to the 
area two centuries ago, seeking a better and more abundant life in balance with 
its mild environment. It surrounds us still and is there to be drawn on and 
enjoyed, even during the deep troughs of our normal dry cycles. 
</P>
<P>
However, we must be watchful so that none of that which is permanently 
beautiful is permanently destroyed by our actions. This year we are all 
watching our toilet flushings, our car washings, our lawn waterings, our water 
meters, our huge water bills, our fights with our politicians and neighbors -- 
all the frantic activities of a short year. We are also making critical choices 
of what to water and what to spare. 
</P>
<P>
Your lawn, after all, can be replaced, your annuals are replaced every year, 
your herbaceous borders can be economically purchased in small nursery 
containers and your bulbs will survive; but what may not survive in three years 
of sequential deterioration is the tree heritage of your beautiful city, county 
and state. 
</P>
<P>
Use the precious water you have to soak all your trees through the efficiency 
of a drip irrigation system. There is no time to lose; summer's heat is upon 
us. The deep roots of the trees have been stressed through two summers already, 
and the water table has dropped too far for some roots to reach. 
</P>
<P>
The trees have been subject to disease in their weakened state for two years, 
and in the months following, many will succumb without help. Even the hardiest 
of native and drought-tolerant trees, once adjusted to the regular waterings 
that a garden receives, will suffer as their waterings diminish: they are no 
longer outfitted to drought conditions. Due to well-drilling and other 
disturbances, the ground water upon which deep-rooted trees depend, is no 
longer available. Smog and other human-introduced conditions, add to the toward 
stress and disease. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the return of a wet year: Your house, yard, estate, garden or park will 
have the lawns replanted and the roses will be blooming, but the magnificent 
oaks will be gone. Or the majestic pines, the broad strutting elms or sycamores 
or the cypress hanging onto the bluff -- all of those will simply be no more. 
</P>
<P>
To a lesser extent, also conserve your shrubs, the large plants of maturity and 
grace. Make sure that they, too, do not deteriorate. It is much more expensive 
to replace them than the smaller plants from seeds or one-gallon cans. 
</P>
<P>
Be forewarned: larger trees and shrubs do not show their stress immediately; 
you may not pick up on their distress within the first six months, particularly 
if you are not a garden horticulturist. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the foliage color has shifted, and you notice tracings in the bark, 
wilting leaves or other such gross changes, it is probable that the structure 
of the tree itself has lost the battle and you have lost your tree. 
</P>
<P>
Please do not wait for the signs. Act now: call your gardener, call a 
contractor, go to your nurseryman, read books, go to the library, call on a 
tree specialist or call in an arborist. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, your local city, county and state government can provide more 
valuable information about how to ride through the drought. Lay out your drip 
lines and immediately begin deep-soaking the priceless greenery of this place 
we all love to live in. 
</P>
<P>
For the sake of this Earth, and your particular spot: for your enjoyment for 
what you do now, and for what you enjoy in the future, take care of these 
things that have been so good to you.

(own-your-owns) in greater Los Angeles are among the hottest properties around, 
thanks to the trend of converting the properties to condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, stock co-ops and own-your-owns have been difficult to 
finance and virtually impossible to sell. Values have dropped. When unable to 
sell or refinance original high interest rate loans, some owners have been 
forced into foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Why the sudden turnaround? Converting co-ops and community apartments into 
condominiums offers many advantages. Financing is readily available. Eager 
first-time buyers snatch up these properties -- still considered bargains in 
California's high-priced market. 
</P>
<P>
To date, in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas, more than 1,000 
cooperative and community apartment units have been converted and 1,500 are in 
the process of converting. What exactly is the difference between co-ops, 
own-your-owns and condominiums? 
</P>
<P>
In a stock cooperative, the corporation owns the whole project, including the 
real property and improvements. The owners are shareholders in the corporation 
and receive lease agreements that give them the right to occupy their units. 
</P>
<P>
In an own-your-own, each owner receives a deed giving him or her an undivided 
interest in the common area of the project along with a right to occupy a unit, 
and an association is formed to manage and maintain the project. 
</P>
<P>
With both the co-op and own-your-own, the homeowners do not actually own their 
individual units. In a condominium, the homeowners do own their individual 
units along with an undivided interest in the common area of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Because a conversion to condominium must be undertaken for an entire building 
or project, the first step for interested owners is to take a preliminary poll 
to determine if sufficient interest exists to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Although most owners react positively to the possibility of converting, some 
raise a variety of concerns: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Potential property tax increases. Persons who have owned their units for a 
number of years may be concerned that their property taxes will increase as a 
result of the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Property taxes typically are unaffected by the conversion, because it is simply 
a change in the form of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Community control over property. Another concern of some owners is 
maintaining the same community atmosphere and control after the conversion. In 
practice, owners will have the same control; the same rules and regulations 
apply to the condominium as were applied before the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
The new condominium association documents only modify those portions of the 
existing documents and rules and regulations as necessary to reflect the 
condominium form of ownership and to comply with current law and lender 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Income tax liability. A final, particularly significant concern is the 
effect of the conversion on individual owners' income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no effect for community apartments, some co-ops may be affected. 
For co-op owners who occupy their units, conversion is generally a tax-free 
transaction for federal and state income tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
But if a project contains a large number of rental units or second homes, the 
income tax results may be different. 
</P>
<P>
After all individual concerns are addressed, the project may begin the 
conversion process. The three basic phases of the conversion are obtaining the 
necessary approvals, redefining the project as a condominium, and changing the 
legal documents and title for each owner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Required approvals. Generally, three approvals are required for the 
conversion -- homeowner, local government and the California Department of Real 
Estate. 
</P>
<P>
While we recommend that at least 75% of the owners approve the conversion, 
California law sometimes allows conversion with approval of only 51% of the 
owners. In many cases, the conversion of a co-op or community apartment to a 
condominium is exempt from the local government ordinances and it is not 
necessary to file a conversion application. 
</P>
<P>
This removes a major obstacle to conversion by eliminating any physical 
requirements or modifications, such as additional parking or any other 
conditions which could be imposed by the city or county. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the California Department of Real Estate conducts an administrative 
review of the new condominium legal documents to ensure that they comply with 
current laws and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Forming the condominium. The second phase, which overlaps the approval 
process, is redefining the project as a condominium project. 
</P>
<P>
An engineer prepares the condominium plan, which is a diagrammatic plan of the 
project and each unit. This becomes the basis for the new legal description of 
the units as condominiums. The attorney prepares the new condominium management 
documents including the covenants, conditions and regulations (CC&amp;Rs), the 
bylaws and articles of incorporation. The attorney also prepares the documents 
that will be used to change the owners' titles during the final phase of the 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Owning the condominium. The final phase of the conversion requires the 
services of both an escrow and title company. Basically, the owners exchange 
their co-op or community apartment unit for a grant deed to their unit as a 
condominium and receive a title insurance policy insuring that they have proper 
legal title to the unit as a condominium. 
</P>
<P>
During this phase, the units can be converted independently one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
The conversion process can be completed in six to eight months for a cost of 
$1,500-$2,500 a unit. 
</P>
<P>
To begin the conversion process, the association needs to retain the necessary 
personnel. The association may choose to hire a single company to coordinate 
and provide all required services for one set fee. Alternatively, the 
association may choose to hire an experienced attorney who will assist the 
association in coordinating the conversion and hiring other personnel, such as 
the engineer, escrow company and title company. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a board member or homeowner may wish to be the "conversion 
coordinator." However, the board should be cautious about accepting a 
volunteer's help because the conversion is a full-time job and issues which 
arise during the conversion are complicated. Those without sufficient expertise 
who attempt to manage a conversion could make the conversion more costly and 
lengthy than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The stock co-op and community apartment "white elephants" are on their way to 
extinction, but no one will miss them. By changing the legal definition of 
these properties to condominiums, thousands of owners are solving their 
financing and sales problems while creating new affordable housing for 
first-time buyers.

An illusory library. Marble looks. Decorators always have been able to achieve 
special effects -- at decorators' prices. 
</P>
<P>
Now these effects can be achieved through wall coverings, in Mary Gilliatt's 
Faux Finish Background and Borders, a collection cooperatively produced by the 
British interior designer and writer and Sandpiper Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"The '90s will be a period of rich decoration, ornamentation, opulence and fine 
detail. Faux finishes and trompe l'oeil are lovely techniques that have moved 
out of the magazines into people's homes," Gilliatt said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the trompe l'oeil ("fool the eye") wallpapers looks like a classical 
library with leather-bound books. The faux finishes also emulate marble and 
other textures. 
</P>
<P>
"Although many people have become adept at creating painted faux finishes on 
their walls -- such as marbleizing, rag rolling or sponging -- for most, 
achieving professional results is beyond their time or abilities," says Richard 
Felber, who heads Sandpiper. The new wallpapers make it possible to achieve the 
same effect with ease and affordability, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Other trends noted by Felber are pattern mixes and inspirational themes, both 
covered in his company's collections. Victorian-style stripes intertwined with 
flowers, paisleys and damasks feature in the Camden Passage collection. 
</P>
<P>
"The more-is-more look is here to stay, be it with Victoriana, English Country 
or Old European looks." 
</P>
<P>
Sandpiper's Bless This House collection includes papers that have borders with 
Biblical quotations and other messages of love and friendship, incorporated in 
traditional designs.

HOME IMPROVEMENT: HANGING DOOR HINGES ON MORTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A.J. HAND, copyright 1990, Los Angeles Times Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few weeks back, while I was watching the NBA playoffs on TV, a friend (who 
only calls when he needs something) rang me up for the complete step-by-step 
procedure for mortising hinges. Engrossed in a close game, I gave him a quick 
brushoff: "Just lay the hinge on your door, trace around it with a sharp knife, 
and then chop out the waste with a chisel." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there are much easier, more accurate ways to get the job done, but 
they are too detailed to go into during the playoffs. Now that the basketball 
season is over, however, I'll be perfectly happy to pass them along. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a lot of doors to hang, go to a good hardware store or Sears and 
buy a template set. With one of these and a router, you can set yourself up to 
knock out mortises in a matter of minutes. Just read the instructions. 
</P>
<P>
If you only have one or two doors to hang, however, it doesn't pay to invest in 
a template. Instead, do the job freehand with a router. 
</P>
<P>
To make the job easy, start with the hinges. Get the kind that have corners 
rounded to a three-eighth-inch radius. Also, if you don't already have one, get 
a straight router bit with a diameter of three-quarter inch. This combination 
will save you a lot of work because the bit will cut a mortise with the same 
radius as the corners of the hinges. 
</P>
<P>
If you buy hinges with square corners, you'll have to chop out the corners of 
the mortise by hand with a chisel. That means more work, and more chances to 
make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
OK, you have your hinges and you have your bit. Chuck the bit in the router, 
turn the router on its head and lay the hinges down on the base plate right 
next to the bit. Adjust the router depth so that the end of the bit is flush 
with a single leaf of the hinge. Your router is now set and ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
Next, place your hinge in position on the edge of the door. Holding it firmly 
in place so it won't skid, cut all the way around the hinge with a sharp 
utility knife. If the hinge tends to slide around while you do this, tack it in 
place with a couple drops of super glue. 
</P>
<P>
If the door is a hardwood such as oak, you may have to go around the hinge two 
or three times with the knife. But for the typical pine door, one firm pass is 
usually enough. Once your cut is made, remove the hinge and you are ready to 
rout. 
</P>
<P>
Turn the router on, place it in position on the edge of the door and start 
cutting. Try to rout right up to the line you have scored. Get your face right 
down where you can see what you are doing, but be sure to wear eye protection. 
As you cut up to the score line, you'll see a tiny splinter of wood tear free. 
That's the sign you have cut far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Cut all around the score line like this, watching for that little splinter. 
Once you have routed out the perimeter, you can go back and rout out the rest 
of the mortise. Just be careful not to let the router tip. 
</P>
<P>
If you have trouble keeping the base plate stable on the narrow edge of the 
door, you can clump scraps of wood on both sides of the door to pack it out and 
provide a wider surface to work on. 
</P>
<P>
Once the mortise is cut, the only other trick to a neat job is driving the 
screws properly. If you drive these out of position, they will pull the hinges 
out of position. So I use a self-centering bit like the one shown in the 
sketch. 
</P>
<P>
This bit -- called a Vix or a Vike bit -- has a conical nose piece that fits 
into the countersink in the hinge and guarantees that you'll drill your pilot 
holes dead center. Good hardware stores often sell these bits, or you can get 
them through mail order tool catalogues such as Trend-Lines, (800) 343-3248, or 
Constantine's, (800) 223-8087.

INTERIORS: RIGHT WINDOWS CAN MAKE THE HOME A SHOWPLACE; 
</P>
<P>
DECOR: WITH A VAST SELECTION AVAILABLE, THE RIGHT WINDOW CAN TRANSFORM A ROOM. 
IT OFTEN IS THE CHEAPEST WAY TO IMPROVE A HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS GIBSON, Gibson is a Malibu free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A window is to a human being as a frame is to a painting," wrote British 
satirist Max Beerbohm. "It strongly defines the content." 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not we are what we look through, the right windows can turn almost 
any home into a showplace. Externally, they provide beauty, character and 
drama, making a tiny house seem spacious, a tract house distinctive, a plain 
house historic or high-tech. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, transformations may be even more spectacular. Gloomy corners are 
flooded with sunshine. Small rooms seem to expand, low ceilings to soar. 
Storage space becomes living space. Once blank walls reveal fascinating views. 
</P>
<P>
Adding and enlarging windows is often the cheapest, most effective way to 
remodel an unappealing house. Older windows used to be hard to match. Today, 
however, the business has grown so competitive that windows of every type and 
period can be ordered through neighborhood glass and hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
New "old" windows combine antique appeal with contemporary innovations: snug, 
glare-free insulating panes; burglar-proof locks; pivoting, easy-clean sashes; 
weather-tight frames that never need painting; removable fiberglass screens; 
even adjustable mini-blinds, built directly into the glass, to block excess sun 
and safeguard privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The first residential windows were multi-paned because it was impossible to 
standardize the thickness of glass. As manufacturing techniques improved, the 
number of panes per window slowly decreased. Single-pane windows were perfected 
in this century. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1945, all home window frames were wooden. Cheaper, low-maintenance 
aluminum frames were introduced during the postwar housing boom. They have been 
flooding the market ever since. But '90s homeowners tend to consider them 
inelegant eyesores. Now that there are alternatives, aluminum sliders and 
louvers are being scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
Vinyl-clad wood-framed windows are just as maintenance-free and much 
better-looking. They come in an endless array of shapes and sizes. They are 
available in double-hung styles and with small panes (or snap-in grids to 
simulate small panes). And they work well with traditional as well as modern 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Goldstein of City Sash &amp; Door in Marina del Rey explains the trend: 
"Apartments and little houses in outlying areas still buy aluminum, but housing 
developments all over Los Angeles are no longer the low-end tracts they were 
after World War II. Property costs too much. Now they are million-dollar homes. 
That's why nearly all new high-end construction is using wooden windows. And, 
today, the easiest way to dress up an older house is to take out aluminum and 
put in new wood windows." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say overall window area should make up about 10% of overall floor 
space. Southern Californians want light and air -- to bring the outdoors in. 
Glass walls can be created even in two-story Victorian homes through artful 
combination of new small-paned circle-top French doors, casements and 
clerestories. 
</P>
<P>
A fun way to bring in extra natural light is with "surprise" windows -- the 
Gothic arch that overlooks back-yard treetops from a staircase landing; the 
sunburst above a kitchen sink that makes it almost pleasant to wash dishes; the 
round, leaded bulls-eye that highlights a peaked ceiling; the floor-level band 
of glass that discloses a glimpse of pool, garden or ocean surf below. 
</P>
<P>
Today's skylights have also gone similar improvements. Ones that open are 
replacing those that don't. All are airtight, weatherproof, glare-proof and 
designed to minimize condensation. Some earn tax refunds as passive solar 
collectors. They come with optional screens, blinds, shades and remote 
controls. They display the sky and admit dramatic beams of filtered sunshine 
especially welcome in windowless bathrooms and attics. Dormer windows just 
below the eaves and roof windows, set into sloping roofs, can also turn dark 
attics into bright bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
There are windows for "problem areas." For instance, sun and air may be needed 
where a standard window would invade privacy or expose an unattractive vista. 
Here, a wide, shallow window can be set close to the ceiling. Or, if light is 
more important than ventilation, glass blocks can be used. 
</P>
<P>
If air is needed and full sunlight is not, a top- or bottom-hinged frame can be 
glazed with colored, frosted or sandblasted glass. Art glass provides the 
costliest but most magnificent option. Antique and salvage dealers stock 
century-old church windows and Tiffany panels as well as frosted art nouveau 
and Art Deco glass hand-etched with transparent motifs. Art glass studios also 
handcraft contemporary windows for modern homes. 
</P>
<P>
Like the frustrating glass walls of office buildings, the large picture windows 
built into most '50s and '60s houses provide light without ventilation or 
charm. Nineties homeowners are replacing them with angled-out bay, bow and 
oriel windows and with circle-top-transomed French doors. 
</P>
<P>
All stationary windows are declining in popularity, except for unusually-shaped 
light sources close to the roof. Those which cannot be hinged are removed. 
Picture windows that do not extend to the floor are being replaced by 
greenhouse windows. These indoor gardens, once available only in aluminum, now 
come with wooden frames, small-pane grids, opening side panels and brackets for 
window seats. 
</P>
<P>
Window glass is tailored to every need. There are varying degrees of 
soundproofing, energy efficiency and sunscreen efficiency depending upon the 
amount needed case to reduce glare and keep upholstery from fading. Reflective 
glass, for example, screens out the most glare and provides the most privacy by 
day, but is transparent when illuminated from within. Budget-minded 
do-it-yourselfers can even shop for used, irregular and unclaimed glass.

COMPUTER RUNS SHOW IN FUTURISTIC KITCHEN; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: THE VOICE-ACTIVATED SYSTEM TAKES MUCH OF THE WORK OUT OF COOKING. 
THE HARD PART IS COMING UP WITH THE SIX-FIGURE PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If the 16th-Century classical Roman architect Andrea Palladio was asked to 
design a kitchen for the post 20th-Century starship Enterprise, it might look 
something like the one in this year's Kips Bay decorator show house in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
The stark, yet luxurious, black and white room, priced into six figures, was 
designed by Eric Bernard to, he says, make people in tuxedos look good. 
Features, he says, are "a ceiling that looks like a cathedral, a floor for an 
emperor's chamber and a range hood that looks like a pipe organ. 
</P>
<P>
"Although 90% of my clients have a catering service or a cook, I thought it 
would be silly not to make the working part as easy and enjoyable as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, he incorporated all the new technological bells and whistles he could 
find. There are voice-activated appliances, a revolving pantry, a garbage 
recycling system and a computerized scale that not only weighs you but suggests 
a diet when you've gained a few pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen, 14-by-28 feet, is divided into three domed sections. The main 
circular work space is in the large central area. Entering the room, you find a 
multiscreened computer and audiovisual system. At the other end, in an alcove, 
is an oversize refrigerator with glass doors and the electrified pantry 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
While the look is stunning -- black granite counters, rounded white laminate 
cabinets, smoked-glass doors, glass domed ceilings and black-and-white Italian 
tile floors -- it's the technology that seems more startling. 
</P>
<P>
The voice-activated system, which can be programmed to recognize up to four 
voices, can turn lights and televisions on and off, start and stop the toaster, 
coffee maker, blender and food processor, and start moving the pantry shelves 
so you can easily retrieve a can of peas or a package of spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
The computer that can be linked to a bathroom scale has been programmed to 
provide nutritional information and recipes. If a list of foods on hand is kept 
up to date, the computer could list needed supplies, print out shopping lists 
for specific recipes and indicate appropriate recipes for dieters. Hookups 
between the videocassette recorder and computer make it possible to watch a 
cooking demonstration and then call up the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
The pantry works like an electrified dumbwaiter. The compact unit has a series 
of shallow shelves that move up and down with the touch of a button. Instead of 
reaching up or down for the desired item, you press a button and wait for the 
item to come to you. Manual operation is possible, too, in case of power 
failure. Each shelf holds up to 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard says it would cost between $200,000 and $300,000, depending on 
equipment, to duplicate the kitchen for a client. Of course, it didn't cost the 
sponsors anywhere near that, because materials and labor were charitable 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Contractor Ray Beech says this kitchen is different in degree more than kind 
from other luxury kitchens. The waste-disposal system -- a prototype -- is 
designed with recycling in mind. Four chutes deliver sorted trash to separate 
containers in the basement. Beech says similar, less-expensive systems already 
are on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The voice activator has been installed in about 6,000 homes and costs $4,500, 
he says. The pantry carousel is about $8,000, not including labor and 
installation. And he says computers already are a part of many kitchens, which 
these days are likely to be viewed as family rooms as well.

REDECORATE WITH A SOFT TOUCH; 
</P>
<P>
CARPETS: FLOOR AND WALL COVERINGS AND LINENS CAN CHANGE ROOM APPEARANCE. NOW 
THEY CAN BE PROTECTED FROM SOIL AND STAINS.

The easiest and most affordable way to redecorate is the softest -- with 
fabrics and carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
That means curtains, bed linens, table linens, wall coverings, rugs, carpets 
and those old standbys, slipcovers and decorator pillows. 
</P>
<P>
Teflon, often associated with pots and presidents, now is protecting fabrics 
from soil and stains. The Du Pont process is being used by makers of fabrics 
who supply both furniture manufacturers and home decorators. 
</P>
<P>
Among these are Waverly's classics in its New Traditions II line -- the 
Jacobean "Marlborough" with an accompanying all-over floral "Montchanin," or 
the leafy "Malvern" and the coordinating stripe "Kennett." 
</P>
<P>
Bloomcraft has a collection of designs inspired by fabrics and wall coverings 
from the Louvre -- a medallion floral accompanied by a chinoiserie stripe, an 
all-over floral, and a vine and scrolled mini, all in a brilliant lacquer red. 
Anju Woodridge offers a large Indian-motif medallion, "Morgan," and its 
coordinating stripe, "MonteCristo." 
</P>
<P>
Shower curtains that have been Teflon-treated are being given full-scale 
decorator treatments with balloon and swag valances, embroidery, ruffles, 
appliques, pleats and borders. 
</P>
<P>
The departure from ordinary ring-and-hang curtains may owe to the 
characteristics of the treated fabrics, which repel soapy water, spilled 
shampoos and lotions, and discourage mildew. Many of the fabric designs are 
matched with those used in the bedroom, and accessories such as sink skirts, 
window curtains, towels, lid covers and rugs can be coordinated. 
</P>
<P>
Floral prints against black backgrounds, animal-skin patterns and paisleys are 
being used to form a richer palette than that used in traditional bathrooms and 
bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The unified bed-and-bath concept is exemplified in the newest Bill Blass for 
Springmaid collection. Five new patterns by the designer -- "Castleton," "Petit 
Point Stripe," "Stanhope," "Montgomery" and "Riande" -- are being marketed in 
sheets, comforters, bed skirts, shams, spreads, draperies, decorative pillows, 
towels and shower curtains. 
</P>
<P>
According to Springmaid, this collection celebrates the 20th anniversary of its 
collaboration with Blass, who was the first "name" designer to branch out into 
home furnishings lines. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble approach also applies to Springmaid's designs by Lynn Hollyn, a 
designer whose European country look coordinates but does not exactly match. 
The Lynn Hollyn at Home Collection features rugs from Masterlooms in the 
designer's muted palette that coordinates with the bed linen line and throws 
from The Three Weavers. 
</P>
<P>
These area rugs are her versions of classic patterns -- "Oxford Quarters," 
"Secret Garden" and "Swedish Hearth," among them. 
</P>
<P>
Bordering and inset designs in wall-to-wall carpeting are part of a new trend 
toward using the floor as a distinct architectural element. Lighter colors can 
be used with more frequency since much carpeting is now treated, like the 
fabrics, to resist stains and dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Combined styles for custom-design looks might include medallions, area stripes, 
borders and other designs. Many of these will be found with Du Pont's 
Stainmaster label. 
</P>
<P>
For a final soft touch, the home decorator can have designer needlepoint 
pillows. Mario Buatta, known for his mastery of English country design, has 
teamed with Thimbelina, the makers of needlepoint designs and products, for his 
interpretations of traditional motifs -- King Charles spaniels, cabbage roses 
and fruits, available in kits or finished pillows.

THE DRAMA BEHIND THE SCENERY; 
</P>
<P>
TALENTED SET DESIGNERS WITH A KEEN EYE FOR DETAIL LEAVE A MARK ON THE STAGE AS 
CLEARLY AS THE ACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If recent pop culture can be succinctly described, it might be called the Age 
of the Designer. 
</P>
<P>
It started with designer jeans, and now it's extended all the way to designer 
hand vacuums. The demand for designed goods, cars and living spaces are all 
telling signs of an ever-growing interest in how things look, and diminished 
interest in what's inside the package. We have all heard the dangers of form 
over substance in many areas of society, and it's also discussed in the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"If everyone was aware of what we do, it would be a theater of design rather 
than a theater of plays," says Cliff Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
While a typical theatergoer won't recognize his (more seldom, her) name in the 
program, the set designer leaves a mark on the stage as clearly as the actors, 
playwright or director. 
</P>
<P>
It's certainly true among four of the major designers who live and/or regularly 
work in Southern California -- Faulkner, D Martyn Bookwalter, John Arnone and 
Robert Israel. 
</P>
<P>
For Faulkner and most of his peers, the stage designer's ethic requires serving 
the play. They are also one player on what Faulkner calls "the team": the 
director, the lighting and sound designers, the costumer, the composer (if 
there is a score), the playwright (if it's a new play). Given this, the stage 
designer's role remains a kind of unofficial secret for most audiences. 
</P>
<P>
This leads to misconceptions. A popular one: Bigger is better. We expect big 
things from a set by John Napier ("Nicholas Nickleby," "Starlight Express," 
"Cats," "Les Miserables"), Ming Cho Lee ("Traveler in the Dark") or David 
Hockney. 
</P>
<P>
Most elements of a good set, however, are in the details. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for instance, the task facing Bookwalter in designing the set for British 
playwright Donald MacKechnie's "Meetin's on the Porch" at the Canon Theatre 
earlier this year. His job appeared spelled out by the title. "With a play 
about three women who get together on a porch," says Bookwalter, "the set 
almost speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Almost. With theater design, nothing is ever so clear-cut. Bookwalter learned, 
for instance, that the original London production had placed the porch far 
up-stage, cutting off actor-audience contact. Besides, "The design wasn't at 
all in the American Midwest style. I had to explain this to Donald, who was 
co-directing (with Richard Olivier)." 
</P>
<P>
Bookwalter also wanted a porch that spoke to the characters, not just another 
porch. 
</P>
<P>
"I designed it with three posts, one for each woman. Probably no one but me 
ever noticed this. But maybe it got into the audience's subconscious. That's 
where a lot of my work plays itself out." 
</P>
<P>
This is a craft that demands mastery of the subtle detail, which is usually 
associated with intimate scale. (The craft is also associated with the work of 
men: fewer women belong to the ranks of set designers, for example, than those 
of lighting and costume design.) 
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, consistently works in large scale, because he spends much of 
his time designing for epic visualist Martha Clarke or for opera, where he has 
become famous for his grand, post-modern gestures (examples include a 
much-praised, much-cursed design scheme for the Seattle Opera's "Ring" Cycle 
and "Mahagonny" at the Music Center). The rest of his time is spent teaching 
design at UCLA, so Israel can afford to be choosy about job offers. 
</P>
<P>
He is rare. Most designers take as much work as their schedules permit. 
Faulkner, for example, is typically jumping between three or four projects, 
mostly at South Coast Repertory, where he is resident scenic designer. Arnone 
and Bookwalter, like a lot of theater people, split their time between 
television and stage. When Arnone isn't preparing a set for a future show at La 
Jolla Playhouse, where his work is frequently seen (recent shows were "Macbeth" 
and "Lulu"), he is busy in production for "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd." 
You'll more often find Bookwalter, one of Los Angeles' most prolific set 
makers, at NBC studios than at L.A. Theatre Center, where he designed the 
just-completed "Strong Man's Weak Child," a play by Israel Horovitz. 
</P>
<P>
"In our field," says Arnone, "you spend a great deal of time doing research. 
You can't clock that time like a lawyer. I don't even want to think about what 
I make in the theater, if I broke it down to an hourly basis." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, at something under TV standard wages, the best set designers are 
coveted and wooed by stage directors -- a great advantage, designers say, since 
a successful set depends on a sound relationship between director and designer. 
"If they really want you," says Bookwalter, "you're off to a good start." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the demand for designers has forced directors to sign up the 
likes of Israel and Arnone well over a year in advance of production. Israel is 
committed to Clarke, his most frequent collaborator ("Garden of Earthy 
Delights," "Vienna: Lusthaus") for an October opening of her "Endangered 
Species" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, after which he has the ballet of 
"Romeo and Juliet" for Florence (summer 1991) and a "Traviata" for Toronto 
(September 1991). 
</P>
<P>
Arnone worked with La Jolla artistic director Des McAnuff on "Macbeth" for a 
year, and planned far in advance for La Jolla's current production, "A Funny 
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." His 1991 plans include "The Illusion" 
with director Sharon Ott at Berkeley Repertory, and 1992 has him working with 
composer Steve Reich on "The Cave" in Stuttgart and at UCLA's Next Wave 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"The need to plan in advance," says Arnone, "isn't only tight schedules, but 
the fact that the more directors want to work with certain designers, the 
earlier they need to contact them." 
</P>
<P>
With tight schedules come budget constraints, especially for such non-profit 
theaters as the Mark Taper Forum, Los Angeles Theatre Center and the Grove 
Shakespeare Festival. At the Grove, the average set construction cost (with 
non-union labor) is between $13-15,000, plus a $2-3,000 wage for the designer. 
LATC pays a similar wage, with an average set cost (also non-union) of $18,000. 
The Taper pays a heftier $6,000, and budgets between $40-70,000 for a set's 
cost (using a union crew). 
</P>
<P>
For all the long-term planning, the key elements of a set design can occur in 
an instant. Bookwalter recalls that "on the same day I was doing the 
(installation) for 'Meetin's on the Porch,' I sat down over lunch with Peggy 
Shannon, the director of 'And Baby Makes Seven,' and drew out the basic set on 
a napkin. I've never had an easier time with a director in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Bookwalter also notes that easier relationships do not necessarily lead to 
better work: "Some of my most difficult collaborations have made very 
successful theater. Charles Marowitz, for example, who wants to put his stamp 
on whatever he does. We'd clash on the plans for 'What the Butler Saw' (at 
LATC) but I'd work with him again in a second." 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps not with playwright/director Edward Albee, whom Bookwalter didn't 
always see eye to eye with on the "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" set at the 
Doolittle Theatre. "I wanted to move the play's time frame into the present; he 
wanted things untouched. I didn't find him to be an exciting director. The set 
suffered because of it." 
</P>
<P>
The difference is good and bad communication. "Sometimes," says Israel, "you 
have no idea where the director is coming from." That can be fatal, for, in 
Faulkner's view, "the director's job is to be my guide." 
</P>
<P>
But, after he has been hired, the designer's first step on the journey of a 
play production comes before the first meeting with the director. Arnone, 
Bookwalter, Faulkner and Israel stress the primacy of reading the play, which, 
Israel says, "isn't the same thing as reading a novel." 
</P>
<P>
Even at this early stage, the work styles of these four vary greatly. Faulkner 
scribbles sketches on a note pad while reading. Israel reads the text, ignores 
any stage directions and takes no notes. Bookwalter takes many notes. 
</P>
<P>
Arnone's process makes him sound like a researcher at the Library of Congress. 
"I read the play over and over, and then I study the political, social and 
cultural background of the play's setting, or the author's own time. Too much 
knowledge at this stage is not a bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
Bookwalter's study in his Eagle Rock home, like Faulkner's in Long Beach and 
Israel's in Brentwood, is lined with books. "Set designers are in love with 
words and research," says Bookwalter. "But the research has a very practical 
purpose: If you know the play up and down, you'll never get lost during 
production." He adds with disarming frankness: "By the time of the first 
meeting, I find that I know the play much better than the director." 
</P>
<P>
These meetings are often brainstorming sessions, although these, too, vary from 
designer to designer. Israel, for instance, has worked so long with Martha 
Clarke "that we'll say the same thing at the same time. More than anything, we 
have a great friendship that's focused by our work. She's intuitive; I'm very 
intellectual." 
</P>
<P>
Arnone has developed a similarly intense interaction with La Jolla's McAnuff. 
Like Israel-Clarke, it's characterized by lengthy discussion and drafting and 
re-drafting. "With 'Macbeth,'I looked for inspiration at the ancient stone 
monoliths at Stonehenge and Avebury. Then I thought of what today's 
architecture would look like when it was the ruins of the future. I conceived 
of glass buildings in decay, then sketched out Celtic structures. 
</P>
<P>
"Melding the two created this neutral, prison-like structure, with eroded 
concrete columns which suggest the ancient monoliths. Among some studies I did 
of Macbeth's castle at Dunsinane, Des picked out one drawing of a wood castle 
on fire that he wanted expanded to the look of the whole show." 
</P>
<P>
Directors will take charge of a design if they feel the need to. Arnone: "I 
don't know of a director who doesn't have a strong visual sense and prejudice." 
Bookwalter, on the other hand, says that director Robert Egan, for whom he 
designed the ivy-infested South African boys school for "The Film Society" at 
LATC, "isn't a visual person, but his productions always have great designs." 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of one director for whom Bookwalter and Faulkner have both worked 
-- Grove Shakespeare Festival artistic director Thomas F. Bradac -- the 
designers themselves are as different as the sets they make. "Cliff seems to 
work very methodically. He may make scene-by-scene sketches. He thinks in 
ordered sequences. Martin likes to jump on an idea and run with it as far as he 
can, and if it doesn't work, leap to another one." 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think that there's a range to my work," says Faulkner. "My approach 
is always to think that the play has never been done before. I try to avoid 
looking at past productions." 
</P>
<P>
One that was hard to avoid and re-invent was South Coast Repertory's "Sunday in 
the Park With George," with its centerpiece as Georges Seurat's huge painting, 
"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte." With this show, design 
ideas and dramatic ideas between director and actor became identical: "We tried 
out an endless number of ideas for how George's model-girlfriend, Dot, steps 
out of the painting she's posing for in the first scene to establish her own 
character. In the New York staging, she bursts out of her dress. We thought 
that was too much of a gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem was that we were struggling with this too much, trying to come up 
with something spectacular. Our solution was simplicity itself: Dot would stand 
for George in a pool of light, and then move out of it into her own world." 
</P>
<P>
Simplicity has become a watchword for much of the most acclaimed recent 
designs. John Napier's gritty, sooty structure for "Nicholas Nickleby" 
virtually melted into the background. Arnone cites the minimal designs for 
Ingmar Bergman's "Hamlet" and Georgio Strehler's "The Tempest" as classic cases 
where "the most stripped-down work is the best way to serve the play. It's 
wrong to think that an elaborate-looking set is in anyone's best interest." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Arnone's working credo is "finding the simplest expression." For 
Bookwalter, "even though I'm hired by the producer, I work for the director, so 
I try to give the director everything he or she wants." Faulkner claims a style 
rather than a credo: "I search for what is intrinsically emotional in a 
theatrical sense." 
</P>
<P>
Israel, by contrast, distrusts emotions: "Don't forget that anything you feel 
in the gut has to go through the brain. But every good design emerges from some 
non-verbal connection with the drama. If my work isn't dramatic, there's no use 
for it. Because I'm a supporting player -- just like the actor, I would 
emphasize -- I'm there to support the drama. Anything else isn't design; it's 
decoration."

BYRON ADAMS, ZEN COMPOSER; 
</P>
<P>
IGNORE FASHION, SAYS THE MAN WHOSE NEW 'CAPRICCIO' WILL ENLIVEN THE STRAWBERRY 
CREEK FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Byron Adams says the modern composer is faced with two dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
First: "How do you create a style that is at once poised, expressive and 
flexible?" 
</P>
<P>
Second: "How do you build a career?" 
</P>
<P>
Adams deals with the first, he says, by writing music that is "not too 
complex." 
</P>
<P>
As for the second, he gets by with a little help from his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been very lucky in that I have built my career on having met, at the 
right time, performers who were interested in my work," says the 35-year-old 
composer, whose "Capriccio" concertante will receive its premiere on Aug. 11 as 
part of the Strawberry Creek Music Festival, which begins Saturday (see 
accompanying schedule). 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these people, including (festival director) Yehuda Gilad, have become 
musical and personal friends of mine, but not in an opportunistic way at all. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how I have built my career. It's slower, but ultimately it's a more 
solid process as opposed to anything that is based too much on fast, 
public-relations appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Atlanta, Adams grew up in Jacksonville, Fla., and studied music at 
Jacksonville University, USC and Cornell. Among his teachers were Halsey 
Stevens and Karel Husa. 
</P>
<P>
"Capriccio" is the third piece Adams has written for Gilad, who met while they 
were both students at USC. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, he wrote a chamber piece, "Nightingales," which Gilad has recorded. In 
1987, he composed "Intrada and Alleluia" for brass and percussion, which Gilad 
performed while he was conductor of the Santa Monica Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Gilad also has invited him to be the first composer-in-residence with his 
Colonial Symphony, in Madison, N.J., for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, Adams has been earning a living teaching choral music 
at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever has actually made his living as a composer," he says. "Even if you 
go back to Monteverdi. He made his living as a chorus master." 
</P>
<P>
But the job has given him the opportunity to grow and develop at his own pace. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard to find one's own way as a composer," he says. "It's sort of a 
Zen process. You feel as if you're making an eternal beginning. Each new piece, 
each blank piece of paper, is a new beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Only when you look back do you see a certain line to what you're doing, a 
certain consistency. I think I am myself at last. I think that's what every 
sincere composer is striving for." 
</P>
<P>
He credits composer William Austin, his doctoral adviser at Cornell, for giving 
him three bits of "crucial" advice: "He said: 'First, ignore fashion. Second, 
ignore fashion. And the third is, ignore fashion.' 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best advice I'd received, outside of a composition lesson, and 
that's what I've done, I hope," Adams says. "I feel that I write for a circle 
of unseen friends, those people who will feel the same way about life and art 
as I do." 
</P>
<P>
Adams describes his new 9-minute "Capriccio," commissioned by the festival, as 
"a little tip of the hat" to American composer and critic Virgil Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
"I admire him tremendously," Adams says. "His views on what American music 
should be are identical to mine. He fought against the German hegemony which 
has bedeviled American music from the late 19th Century until today, and which 
I think continues to bedevil American music." 
</P>
<P>
The piece quotes "Nettleton," a hymn tune Thomson used in one of his film 
scores. Otherwise, the piece, Adams says, is "a little problem I gave myself in 
design." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted a certain kind of brilliance, so I decided to omit the low brass 
instruments and concentrate on the brighter timbres," he says. "The piece is 
very soloistic in its writing for the woodwinds. Each woodwind gets a turn in 
an important solo part." 
</P>
<P>
While he considers himself lucky to get the premiere of his work at the 
festival, he recognizes that another danger lies therein for the modern 
composer. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always the danger of any composer in America, me or someone in an 
older generation, of becoming a premiere machine," he says. "You write this 
piece, it 
</P>
<P>
will be premiered and after the premiere you'll never have another performance. 
It's a disturbing phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it is the expense of producing a large orchestral piece. Also, 
oftentimes performers, conductors and instrumentalists, just for economic 
reasons, will go with safer programs. They'll be excited by doing a piece and 
do it once and will feel, 'I've done my bit for contemporary music.' 
</P>
<P>
"Sadly, this can be the composer's fault too, sometimes," he added. "Either he 
or she will provide a score that somehow is not practicable. . . . You can 
write a fiendishly difficult piece and have the piece premiered. But the 
fiendish difficulty will militate against a second performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Elliott Carter can write a (notoriously difficult) Double Concerto, but if a 
person my age and at my reputation wrote a work as difficult as that, the 
chances are the composer will wait a long time before getting a second 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he believes that quality will prevail, and he advises composers to 
"write a consistent flow of music. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not stressed enough. I also wish there were more avenues for second 
performances. There are so many grants and commissions that deal with the 
initial performance. I wish there were a grant apparatus that would fund second 
performances." 
</P>
<P>
(In fact, there is at least one such fund, the "AT&amp;T American Encore" 
program, created in 1985 by the telecommunications giant to provide support for 
orchestras to revive infrequently performed works of 20th-Century American 
composers.) 
</P>
<P>
While "Capriccio" is scheduled for only one festival performance, he believes 
it has a good chance for further performance because of its length and 
orchestration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy, but it doesn't present insurmountable difficulties to an 
orchestra," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be an interesting program, quite aside from my piece. The 
program is my 'Capricco' Concertante, then the Immolation from (Wagner's) 
'Gotterdamerung,' with Jeannine Altmeyer, and then the Tchaikovsky Fifth 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm rather glad my piece comes first. Who wants to follow the 'Immolation 
Scene'? The person who should be nervous is Tchaikovsky."

CALTRANS DOLES OUT DUTIES FOR OFFENDERS DOING 'HARD LABOR' ALONG SOUTHLAND 
FREEWAYS 
</P>

<P>
It is penal service hiding behind coy euphemisms. 
</P>
<P>
Work release. Celebrity diversion. Special programs. 
</P>
<P>
They are, in essence, chain gangs without shackles. 
</P>
<P>
"I sentence a lot of people to work with Caltrans," said a Los Angeles 
municipal court commissioner. "Because it is hard work that in the heat of 
summer becomes hard labor." 
</P>
<P>
Said a Caltrans work crew supervisor of the discipline he helps enforce amid 
the ice plant and fast-food detritus of our state highway system: "You can 
classify it as boot camp. Because nobody volunteers for it and it's the job 
that our people (regular employees) don't want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Said the director of a county center that assigns work to those sentenced to 
all forms of community service: "On our list of 100 activities, picking weeds 
for Caltrans is not very popular. When people come in with a Caltrans form, 
they know that the judge meant business." 
</P>
<P>
Said the sheriff's deputy of any reluctant lags on the state Department of 
Transportation work crews: "If they screw up, we handcuff 'em and bring 'em 
back. It's slam dunk." 
</P>
<P>
But not many screw up. 
</P>
<P>
They lift those cans. 
</P>
<P>
They tote those bales of trash. 
</P>
<P>
Because they all got a little drunk (or shoplifted, were joy riding, speeding 
or slapping cops) and would certainly have landed in jail but for California's 
well-established program of using its misdemeanants to keep freeway embankments 
beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
And these litter-pickers are not only impoverished culprits who could not 
afford a good lawyer. But also the attorney and the aerospace engineer, the 
television actor and the mayor's daughter, the Skid Row hotel owner and the 
newspaper reporter, and . . . 
</P>
<P>
* Kelsey Grammer, who plays a fun, neurotic psychiatrist on the NBC series 
"Cheers," recently was sentenced to 10 days work with a Caltrans cleanup crew. 
It was one of several sentences handed Grammer, 35, for drunk driving, 
possession of cocaine and probation violations. When last seen, Grammer, a.k.a. 
Dr. Frasier Crane, was eastbound on the Ventura Freeway, picking weeds and his 
way to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
* Earlier this year, Phyllis Bradley, 44, daughter of Mayor Tom Bradley, was 
ordered to a 30-day tour of duty with a Caltrans crew after pleading guilty to 
drunk driving. She was also fined, placed on probation and told to undergo 
alcohol counseling. 
</P>
<P>
* In October, actor David Carradine, first of the karate kids and the enigmatic 
Kwai Chang Caine of television's "Kung Fu," pleaded no contest in Van Nuys 
Municipal Court to driving under the influence of alcohol. He was given three 
years' probation -- and 30 days on the end of trash tweezers with a Caltrans 
road gang. It seemed to add meaning to Caine's quiet and obtuse teaching: "The 
wise man walks aways with his head bowed, humble, like the dust." 
</P>
<P>
* Michael Pringle, the Cal State Fullerton running back recently drafted by the 
Atlanta Falcons, has been tackled several times by the law. Last year he was 
sentenced to probation and Caltrans litter duty on a petty theft. Pringle, who 
had pleaded no contest, is a criminal justice major. 
</P>
<P>
* The cop slapper. It was not Zsa Zsa but Rose Demirjian, 38, a news writer for 
the Armenian Reporter. She was stopped by a Glendale policeman for making an 
illegal left turn and managed to elevate the incident into a charge of 
misdemeanor battery on the officer. Demirjian, of Hollywood, was fined early 
this year, placed on probation and drew 30 days picking up trash and swinging a 
weed hoe for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
"But the intention (of the court sentence) is to do work," remarked Percy Ross, 
a superintendent with Caltrans' Long Beach Maintenance Station. "Just because 
they are celebrities, they don't get to ride around with a superintendent all 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"They're out bending and sweating alongside everybody else. We don't treat 
anyone any different." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Caltrans does discriminate a little. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was dictated by law enforcers who know that even nonviolent, 
minimal-risk offenders will sometimes be tempted to walk away from their 
conscience and an honor-system work crew. 
</P>
<P>
So the next time you see a freeway clique bagging Cold Cups and Krackel 
wrappers, examine the head gear. 
</P>
<P>
Regular Caltrans employees wear white hard hats. California Conservation Corps 
workers chose blue. Transgressors doing time wear orange hard hats. 
</P>
<P>
Miscreant trash patrols, remembers Richard Murphy, a Caltrans consultant and 
retired chief of maintenance, started in 1983 when his office "was approached 
by groups handling court referrals . . . agencies interested in finding some 
place where their people could do some meaningful work beneath supervision." 
</P>
<P>
Considered alongside the essentials of maintaining safety and traffic movement, 
he said, litter pickup had never been a biggie among Caltrans priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"So it was agreed that if they (referral agencies) could furnish people . . . 
we'd supply the work site, the tools and the transportation," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
The beginnings were slow. "We were lucky, in that initial year, if we could put 
out two crews (of offenders) of 15 men each or enough to fill two vans," Murphy 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Program expansion in the seven years since has been enormous. "They 
(maintenance supervisors) are all telling me they are using every van they have 
and two buses to handle the people," said Stan Lisiewicz, Caltrans' chief of 
field maintenance. "We've had to turn people (court referrals) away, telling 
them to come back another time. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't reached a critical overload, but we're right at the red line and if 
there's any increase I don't think we can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the freeway cleanup crews -- whether formed from direct court 
referrals or from jail inmates earning reduction of sentences of 120 days or 
less -- have become vital to running a tight freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"Our principal responsibility is safety," Lisiewicz said. 
</P>
<P>
So every temporary who shows for cleanup chores, he continued, frees a 
permanent worker for drain maintenance, slide removal, spill cleanup, light 
repairs, striping and marking, and other duties. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't give anywhere near the level of (safety) service without them," 
Lisiewicz added. "And without these people, we'd be knee deep in trash." 
</P>
<P>
Examine any group of offenders and there won't be a Cool Hand Luke in the lot. 
Caltrans crew leaders -- on an average of one to a dozen laborers -- aren't 
even armed with whistles. There is little failure to communicate, and nobody 
has to ask the boss for water. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the theory and purpose of convict labor remains -- and last year Caltrans' 
wrongdoer work force picked up 253,000 cubic feet of litter at zero labor cost 
to the taxpayer. That was enough to fill a line of dump trucks 250 miles long. 
A four-year load would fill the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The program covers every state highway, byway, byroad and bike path in 
California. From Pacific Coast Highway east to the Nevada border roads; from 
where Interstate 5 crosses the Mexican border and heads north to wave goodby 
and disappear into Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties, with more than 1,100 
miles of state-maintained highways, where the program is largest and most 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
In May, court-ordered maintenance work (which includes pruning, transplanting, 
painting over graffiti as well as litter pickup) resulted in more than 12,000 
days donated to three-county beautification. That translates to almost 150,000 
days in the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
And that, said Lisiewicz, is "the same as having 600 extra workers out there, 
seven days a week . . . although we accept that they are not as efficient, not 
as highly motivated (as paid employees) because they don't really want to be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Or do they? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be doing this," said Sissy McEwen, 22, of Carson. She was hacking 
at dandelions and dog fennel along a fence line of the Artesia Freeway. "I know 
the monotony of jail time when the hours pass like days and the days like 
years, just sitting among prostitutes, drug dealers and real degenerates." 
</P>
<P>
McEwen, a cook on a catering truck, has been jailed twice. "Why? I drink and 
drive too much, that's why." She was recently convicted of a third 
drunk-driving offense and sentenced to 45 days with Caltrans. "So I've sold my 
car, bought a bicycle and got on Antabuse." 
</P>
<P>
In jail, she said, there was only time to brood and resent an environment of 
"no rehabilitation . . . just sitting there being treated like a dog." But with 
Caltrans "they treat you with respect, they consider you to be human. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, nobody likes doing this stuff for free. But it makes you think, it makes 
you put two and two together until you know if you don't do something about 
yourself, life isn't going to get any better." 
</P>
<P>
McEwen's day had started at the Long Beach yard, headquarters of Caltrans' West 
Beach region, at 6:30 a.m. She reported with 80 other court referrals. 
</P>
<P>
They were real estate assessors, the unemployed, an auto mechanic, an insurance 
salesman, a gardener able to smile at having to work his trade for nothing, and 
a student ("no names please . . . this is not something you go around and brag 
about") who saw irony in his T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
He had received it for participating in a Long Beach Police Celebrity Sports 
tournament. A few weeks after donating his athletic effort and entrance fee, 
police busted him for joy riding in a 1984 Toyota Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was Seal Beach police," he said. He was sentenced to 20 days with 
Caltrans and had completed eight. "But I'll take this over jail. This helps the 
state. Going to jail doesn't help anyone. This is constructive punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Another man, a real estate salesman in sweat suit and sneakers, didn't mind 
talking about the work ("I couldn't move out of bed after the first day") but 
also declined to give his name because "there are friends and family who don't 
know I'm in this situation. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd gone to jail (for drunk driving) everybody would have known. But here I 
can work weekends, take some sick days and nobody will know. But I don't want 
to have to do this work again. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a pretty sobering experience. And I'm not really a drinking 
man." 
</P>
<P>
Charles George, a crew boss, called for attention in the yard and spoke the 
orders of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Hard hats and vests would be worn at all times. Always work facing traffic. Be 
careful walking on slopes. Look out for glass and sharp objects. 
</P>
<P>
"Sexual harassment, be it male or female, is not permitted." That brought 
sniggers from both sides. "Watch out for snakes." There was dead silence at 
that one. "No spitting in the (hard hat) can . . . no drugs or alcohol are 
allowed . . . and, need I remind you, no leaving the program." 
</P>
<P>
Then vans towing portable toilets and carrying tools and toilers moved out 
across the county. 
</P>
<P>
There, the guilty chewed dust and the fresh smog of crush-hour traffic. They 
squished and skidded on ice plant while tugging fallen ash saplings toward a 
mulcher. They endured a BYOSL (Bring Your Own Sack Lunch) alongside the 
Terminal Island Freeway, inarguably the noisiest, filthiest and most dangerous 
private picnic ground in America. 
</P>
<P>
It only reminded Thomas (Tom-Tom) Lang, a 24-year-old legal services messenger, 
of how lucky he was. "Who would want to go to jail?" he asked. "I was once a 
civilian employee for LAPD and saw the holding cells at the Van Nuys division. 
That was not something I liked." 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was something he risked a few months ago when he was involved in a 
street argument. Lang picked up a crowbar. He says he didn't swing. But he was 
arrested anyway and convicted of intent to commit assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Lang was sentenced to 27 days with Caltrans where, he says, the hours "are not 
easy to do . . . but the 20 days so far have taught me a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"To think smart. To play cool. To realize I'm still a young man and working my 
way up. So who needs jail, trouble, or even this (Caltrans) experience again? 
</P>
<P>
"After 27 days, you'll never see Tom-Tom again." 
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation. Recidivism. Lessons learned. 
</P>
<P>
Yet these really aren't aims of Caltrans sentences because the program does not 
involve hard-core criminals. 
</P>
<P>
What it does achieve, the jurists and program administrators say, is a small 
easing of overcrowded jails. Los Angeles County Jail, for example, regularly 
squeezes more than 21,000 offenders into a facility built for 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
Commented Los Angeles Sheriff's Lt. James Oneill, who is in charge of the 
work-release program: "There was a time when someone who had 30 days to do came 
in and kept on walking right out the back door because we were too crowded. Now 
we are putting them to work." 
</P>
<P>
The county's Inmate Placement Program, he continued, disperses early release 
workers to more than 100 agencies, including Caltrans. Combined savings are 
huge. 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining prisoners within four walls, Oneill said, costs "$30 per day per 
prisoner." During the 1988-89 fiscal year, outside work programs saved the 
county "$16 million in prisoner maintenance costs alone." 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the value of services performed by those prisoners: "It worked 
out to 2.5 million hours of service last year, which, using the minimum hourly 
wage, would have meant $12 million in payments." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Rebecca Omens-Rochman sees another 
small but important bonus: "This way, we know that defendants are going to 
serve all their time." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Block is the court commissioner who sentenced Carradine to Caltrans. 
But today, he said, Carradine might well have been detoured to graffiti removal 
with the city "due to the fullness of Caltrans." 
</P>
<P>
Either job is heavy duty for the typical minor violator ("usually upstanding, 
regular, middle-class people of all nationalities . . . not criminals") and, 
Block said, punishment fitting the crime. 
</P>
<P>
It might not be breaking rocks, he agreed, but a Caltrans detail "is punishment 
. . . and much more physically demanding than filing papers as part of some 
standard community services sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Yet tough as it is, working a Caltrans road gang is not the lowest rung on the 
county service ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Oneill saves this job for those who might balk at freeway work. 
</P>
<P>
"Coroner's cleanup," he said.

Lost Trees -- The fast-moving brush fire that scorched more than 6,500 acres 
last weekend did much of its damage in Chino Hills State Park, starting near 
one of the park's Orange County entrances (near Rim Crest Drive in Yorba Linda) 
and burning northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the damage was to grass-covered hills, which will probably recover 
within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
However, some California walnut trees were lost in Telegraph Canyon, the park's 
major east-west canyon, along with nearly all the trees in an adjoining side 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The park remains open, but park officials say it is more important than ever to 
stay on trails. Traveling over the now-denuded hills, especially by bike or 
horse, can lead to serious erosion problems. 
</P>
<P>
Chino Hills State Park comprises more than 10,000 acres of undeveloped hills 
and canyons covering portions of Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties. The fire was started accidentally by a boy playing with a 
model rocket. 
</P>
<P>
Animal Jazz -- Santa Ana Zoo visitors can enjoy the sounds of live jazz today, 
beginning at 4 p.m. The annual "Jazz at the Zoo" event features music by Rico 
Garcia, Axiom and the John Anello Group, along with food from the Studio Cafe 
in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The event is co-sponsored by Saddleback College's jazz station, KSBR (88.5 FM) 
in Mission Viejo. Admission at the gate is $12 ($10 for members). Information: 
(714) 953-8555.

TIME RUNNING OUT FOR 8-YEAR-OLD WHO NEEDS TRANSPLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ORANGE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amy Aronson loves bicycle riding, so when the 8-year-old Laguna Hills girl won 
a mountain bike in a school coloring contest she was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
But since its January delivery, the bike has sat unused as Amy has grown ever 
weaker from the debilitating effects of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that 
causes respiratory infections and gradually weakens the entire body. 
</P>
<P>
She is now hospitalized, awaiting a heart-lung transplant that may mean new 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Her parents, Linda and Richard Aronson, have maintained a bedside vigil at 
Children's Hospital of Orange County, hoping to receive word that the operation 
can proceed. But donor organs are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Amy tops the waiting list for her size, in the eight days since she 
was placed on two organ procurement lists that cover Southern California there 
has been no word of a prospective donor. 
</P>
<P>
For the Aronsons, it is an agonizing time because they know that 20% to 30% of 
all transplant candidates die before a suitable organ can be found. 
</P>
<P>
They are hoping that anyone who knows or suspects that matching organs may 
become available -- such as from the victims of traffic accidents -- will call 
local transplant registries. But their plea is not only for their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
It's crucial that people are reminded of "how important it is to consider 
donating their organs," said Richard Aronson, a Superior Court commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Amy's condition was diagnosed when she was 2, her father said. Although there 
is no cure for the disease, victims can be treated with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
Though many children are able to lead normal and long lives with treatment, 
Amy's case is much more severe than most. 
</P>
<P>
She used to run and play like any girl, said Richard Aronson. She would get 
dizzy and have terrible headaches, but that did not stop her from chasing her 
younger brother, Richie, now 6, around the house. She took ballet lessons. 
Bright and outgoing, she is an "A" student. 
</P>
<P>
"But gradually those things fell by the wayside," her father said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the antibiotics failed to stem the secretion of mucus that choked 
her lungs. Since the beginning of the year, "she has had to wear oxygen masks 
more often, she couldn't walk, then she needed a wheelchair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
She now weighs about 40 pounds, said Dr. Ralph Rucker, director of pediatric 
pulmonary services at Children's Hospital. Without a transplant, which she 
would undergo at UC San Diego, she may have only one or two weeks to live. 
</P>
<P>
"She's in very critical condition. She has major difficulty in breathing," 
Rucker said. "It's not 'maybe' or 'perhaps.' She will not survive without a 
transplant." 
</P>
<P>
There have been fewer than 100 combined heart-lung transplants performed in the 
United States, said Dr. Stuart Jamieson, a leading transplant surgeon and chief 
of cardio-thoracic surgery at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
About a half-dozen people who need combined transplants are on the UCSD waiting 
list, including Amy, Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
The UCSD program has about an 80% survival rate after one year for the combined 
operation. The problem remains one of finding donor organs. Under California 
law, hospitals are required to approach the families of potential organ donors, 
but the need still far outstrips the supply, Rucker said. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker and Aronson want to remind people that much good can often be retrieved 
from tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a chance to donate my children's organs to someone, it would seem a 
way for them to live on," Aronson said. "If I could contribute to helping 
someone else live, it would be special to me." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who wants more information or knows of prospective donor organs may call 
the California Heart Transplant Center in San Diego at (619) CA-HEART or the 
Organ and Tissue Acquisition Center, also in San Diego at (619) 294-6263.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: JUDGE WITH 2 JURIES ON HIS HANDS FINDS WAY TO CUT 
LOGISTICAL KNOT

<P>
Justice invariably prevails in most courtrooms in Orange County. In nine years 
of court reporting, I can't recall a single case where I was convinced that a 
defendant got a bum rap from either a judge or a jury. 
</P>
<P>
For a while last week, however, I thought I had finally found one. 
</P>
<P>
In Superior Court in Newport Beach, Roman Gabriel Menchaca, 19, is on trial, 
with two others, accused of the most heartless killing imaginable: a drive-by 
gang shooting where at least 20 rifle shots were sprayed into a gathering. A 
4-year-old boy was killed, along with an 18-year-old. Six others were wounded; 
one lost a leg. 
</P>
<P>
It's sickening stuff to hear. But one thing was clear: No way were these three 
defendants going to get a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a lawyer's conflict, Menchaca was not ready for trial the same time 
as his co-defendants, Robert P. Figueroa, 20, and Louis P. Valadez, 28. The 
conflict was ironed out just as the jury for the Figueroa and Valadez trial was 
selected. Instead of ordering a separate trial for Menchaca, Superior Court 
Judge Tully H. Seymour followed the lead from other counties and decided to try 
the case with two juries: One for Menchaca, one for the other two defendants. 
That would save taxpayers considerable expense of another trial, and spare the 
witnesses having to testify twice. Prosecutors loved the idea. The defense was 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
When opening statements and the first testimony reached the jury on July 10, 
the proceedings approached the bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour had spectators on one side of the audience. On the other, he seated the 
Menchaca jury and its alternates, three to four abreast, row after row behind 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
For fairness, the judge announced, he would alternate the two juries into the 
jury box week by week during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't take a genius to see that whichever defendant's jury was sitting 
in the outfield was going to get the short end. 
</P>
<P>
The problems were glaring. The door was always noisy when spectators came in or 
out, a major distraction to the jurors in the back rows. Those jurors couldn't 
see the prosecutor's charts. Much of the time, they couldn't hear the witnesses 
or the lawyers. And the times they could hear, they appeared to strain. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the outfield jurors plainly showed their irritation at the 
conditions. Seymour tried to make some amends. He positioned a deputy marshal 
at the door to cut down on spectator noise. He had Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas 
Avdeef move his charts to a better vantage point. But it just wasn't working. 
</P>
<P>
There was a greater concern too. Some cases rest primarily on physical 
evidence, which jurors can take into the jury room during deliberations. But 
this gang trial relies primarily on eyewitness identification of the killers. 
The credibility of their testimony was a key factor to both prosecutors and 
defense. But how can a juror pick up on inflections, or expressions, or tone, 
when just seeing the witnesses is an accomplishment in itself? 
</P>
<P>
Someone had to set this judge straight about what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
But it turned out the judge didn't need a reporter's help. Art Snow, the 
judge's bailiff, saw the problem. So did Susan Colton, his clerk for that week. 
And the judge saw it himself. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, after conferring with Colton and Snow, Judge Seymour 
announced to the lawyers before court: "We're moving." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour had lobbied with his next-door neighbor, Judge Ragnar R. Engebretson, 
to trade courtrooms for the remainder of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was incredible. Because the new courtroom is so much larger, the 
second jury is no longer by the door, or far away from the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors sit next to the railing in just two rows. No one's vision is 
blocked. Charts and witnesses can be seen clearly. Jurors are no longer in the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
The new courtroom has a sound system much improved over the first one. In fact, 
the two juries at this trial can hear much better than in most of the 
courtrooms at the main courthouse in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
It may be someone's subject for debate that two juries sitting in on the same 
trial cannot produce a fair trial for anyone. But if two juries are a thing of 
the future in such cases, it's not likely anyone could make it work 
logistically better than Seymour has done it here.

LOCAL ELECTIONS DISTRICT ATTORNEY; 
</P>
<P>
ENRIGHT FORCES A SERIOUS CAMPAIGN 
</P>

<P>
When Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright decided just 24 hours before the 
closing deadline to run for district attorney, he knew it would be on a 
shoestring. He had no staff, money or plans. 
</P>
<P>
But that's all changed now that Enright has forced Dist. Atty. Michael R. 
Capizzi into a November runoff. At a fund-raiser at the Balboa Bay Club in 
Newport Beach last week, Enright was backslapping with longtime friends and 
thanking them for donations. 
</P>
<P>
The total isn't in yet, but Enright said his financial advisers have told him 
that there were close to 100 paying guests, with an average donation of about 
$250. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good first fund-raiser," Enright said. "But you can bet it won't be 
the last." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, he has a long way to go to catch Capizzi, who has already raised 
close to $300,000 and expects to hold more fund-raisers before November. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi followers said they consider the Enright fund-raiser a weak show by 
their opponent, but Enright has unquestionably come a long way from the 
primary, when he could barely afford a handful of newspaper ads and had no 
help. 
</P>
<P>
He now has a campaign committee, headed by former County Administrative Officer 
Bob Thomas. Others running his campaign include Santa Ana lawyer William L. 
Anderson and financial adviser Robert Duff. Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. 
Freeman, who also ran as an anti-Capizzi candidate in the primary, is a chief 
campaign adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"The backing is here," Thomas said. "We just had to nudge Jim a little and 
convince him he could win." 
</P>
<P>
The fund-raiser turnout included Westminster Municipal Judge Dan C. Dutcher, a 
longtime friend and golfing partner of Enright's, and criminal lawyer Sylvan B. 
Aronson, who represented county builder Leroy Rose -- one of those Capizzi 
helped send to prison in the early 1980s in a political corruption campaign by 
the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Another person sent to prison in that campaign was County Supervisor Ralph 
Diedrich, a close ally of Thomas'. 
</P>
<P>
Dutcher complained about the state judicial ethics code, which severely limits 
the role a judge can play in supporting a candidate for a non-judicial office. 
While Dutcher cannot give Enright more than $100, his wife is under no such 
restrictions, so she donated $1,000 to Enright. 
</P>
<P>
Aronson was buoyed by the varied types who came by to wish Enright well and 
make a contribution. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Enright has a lot of friends in the defense bar in this county," Aronson 
said. "Jim has a clear understanding of our roles. He's the prosecutor and we 
represent the defendant; but we are both officers of the court. We're part of 
the same system. Mike Capizzi doesn't understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Some cheered when one speaker suggested that Capizzi had simply been a hatrack 
for Cecil Hicks. Before Hicks resigned as district attorney to take a judgeship 
in January, Capizzi had been his chief assistant and longtime protege. Their 
relationship came at the expense of Enright, whose power and prestige within 
the office deteriorated greatly as Capizzi's career moved on. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi was unanimously appointed by the Board of Supervisors in January, with 
Hicks' public blessing, just before Hicks took the bench. The supervisors were 
lavish in their praise of Capizzi, and all have since endorsed his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Though Capizzi was the top vote-getter in the November primary, most of the 
supporters at Enright's fund-raiser last week said the numbers favor Enright. 
Capizzi got 41% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"That tells me 60% of the people don't want him," Aronson said, because all of 
the other candidates had run anti-Capizzi campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Enright trailed Capizzi by nearly 40,000 votes. And Capizzi has 
picked up most of the county's heavyweight endorsements, including almost every 
police association that exists, plus the prestige of the support from the 
county's own association of deputy district attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
How does Enright plan to overcome that support? 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe that financially, we're not going to have a problem," Enright 
said. "We're going to have enough to put on the campaign we want. But what 
we're counting on is enough volunteers to do things like walking precincts for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
The only way to win, Enright said, is through hard work by the candidate and 
his committee. Enright said he remains undecided about whether he will take a 
leave of absence or substantial time off before the election. 
</P>
<P>
While the Enright camp is excited that he is off to a good start, Capizzi said 
last week that he is not worried about his opponent and does not plan to change 
his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at my desk," Capizzi said. "I'm working. I'm trying to be the best 
district attorney I can." 
</P>
<P>
Both men report they have a cordial working relationship within the office. 
</P>
<P>
One question that remains is whether Enright will begin picking up some of the 
anti-Capizzi zeal in his campaign that some of his supporters have. During the 
primary, Enright rarely spoke about Capizzi by name, but did make remarks about 
his distaste for "politicians taking over the district attorney's office" -- a 
reference to the Board of Supervisors' appointing Capizzi instead of waiting 
for the 1990 election to determine a successor for Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think voters will respond to a negative campaign," Enright said. "I'm 
just not going to get into that kind of thing."

SAN CLEMENTE SURFER CAN'T CATCH PLANE OUT OF MEXICO AND MISSES HIS HEAT; 
</P>
<P>
SURFING: SHANE BESCHEN'S QUEST FOR THE PSAA TOUR TITLE IS DEALT A SERIOUS 
SETBACK.

SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a dark day for some of the home boys at the Body Glove San Clemente Surf 
meet. Sixteen surfers gained a spot in today's quarterfinals during Saturday's 
competition, but a no-show raised more eyebrows than any of the show-offs who 
were trying to make the most of a weak one- to two-foot southwest swell. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente's Shane Beschen, ranked No. 3 on the Professional Surfers Assn. of 
America tour, could not get a plane out of Mexico in time to make his morning 
heat. He had been mixing business and pleasure during a photo session and 
surfing vacation in Isle de Natividad. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Shane is fuming," said Jim Hogan, another San Clemente surfer who is a 
top-ranked PSAA pro and longtime friend of Beschen's. "But when you go to 
Mexico, you have to be aware of the potential travel problems. It's really 
unfortunate, though. A real bummer." 
</P>
<P>
Beschen, who gets zero points as a no-show, figures to take a free-fall in the 
PSAA rankings and his quest for the tour title has been dealt a serious 
setback. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan also knows all about difficult blows and shattered dreams, however. He 
re-injured a knee in his first heat during the PSAA meet June 23 in Oceanside 
and is now No. 8 in the rankings . . . and will probably slip lower. The injury 
required surgery -- the second procedure on the same knee -- and now he's just 
hoping to be ready for the Aug. 8-12 PSAA stop at Salt Creek in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Dino Andino, the sole remaining member of the trio that has become known as the 
"San Clemente Mafia," kept the hometown crowd's hopes alive by unanimously 
winning his heat and advancing to the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was going pretty slow out there today, but I guess I got a 
couple of good waves," Andino said. "Hopefully, we'll get a little better swell 
(today)." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point's Chris Billy also lamented the lack of swell after winning his heat 
to advance. "It's pretty hard to recognize what's a good wave," he said. "It's 
mainly just a bunch of ripples out there." 
</P>
<P>
Hogan, of course, would have been grateful to be among the select group taking 
on the late-afternoon slop on the north side of the San Clemente Pier. 
</P>
<P>
He underwent surgery to repair cartilage damage after the final PSAA event of 
1989, but the knee "popped out" during the first PSAA contest of 1990 in Puerto 
Rico. He manipulated the knee back into place and somehow managed to finish 
second to Newport Beach's Richie Collins in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan walked down and put his jersey in the water Saturday morning as his heat 
paddled out, which meant he earned $100 and, much more importantly, 282 points, 
for participating. Beschen, who won the PSAA Bolsa Chica meet in May, was to be 
a favorite here this week. One thousand points goes to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know how crucial those 282 points are?" Hogan said. "If this meet 
were in Florida, I'd have flown out there just to touch the water. Last year, 
Mike Lambresi won the title by four points. Four points." 
</P>
<P>
Surfing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The much-anticipated Heat No. 8 during the morning's first round of the main 
event lived up to the hype. Florida teen-ager Kelly Slater pulled off the big 
maneuvers again and bested veterans Noah Budroe of Huntington Beach and Chris 
Brown of Santa Barbara. In the battle for second, Brown, the PSAA's top-ranked 
surfer, edged Budroe, ranked seventh, to advance. Two judges had Brown second 
and Budroe third, two had Budroe second and Brown third and one had them tied 
for second. Budroe clearly had a more consistent session, but only the best 
four of 10 waves are judged. The tiebreaker system compares the best three 
rides and Brown, who had two spectacular waves early in the heat, got the nod. 
A red-eyed Budroe looked over the tally sheets, added up the numbers again and 
shook his head in disbelief. "It's cool, man," he said, looking toward the 
judges' tower as he walked away. Slater took second place in the second round 
of the main event and advanced to the quarterfinals. Brown was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County surfers advancing to the quarterfinals were Pat O'Connell 
and Vince de la Pena of Laguna Niguel; Brian and Terence McNulty of Capistrano 
Beach; Bryan Pottger of Fountain Valley, and Matt Archbold of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hogan hasn't wasted much time while rehabilitating his knee. When he's not 
undergoing therapy, he takes long walks in the sand and in the water. And when 
he's not working on improving the strength of his knee, he's watching 
videotapes of his surfing or attending contests to observe his opponents.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 327 to 93, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 4329) 
authorizing nearly $1 billion over three years for programs to keep America a 
leader in technology. The bill reauthorized the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, which regulates weights and measures, and funded government 
research to benefit specific enterprises such as steel. 
</P>
<P>
Its most disputed feature was funding of the Advanced Technology Program, which 
provides federal grants to help entrepreneurs develop new technologies. The 
bill authorized nearly $400 million over three years for ATP, compared to only 
$10 million annually recommended by President Bush, who prefers private funding 
of such ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Robert A. Roe (D-N.J.) said the government "cannot afford to wait one 
minute longer" to keep America competitive with the Japanese and Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) said spending too much on ATP means "trading 
off core research for essentially a new program that in some cases could be 
handouts." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to pass the bill.

By a vote of 327 to 93, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 4329) 
authorizing nearly $1 billion over three years for programs to keep America a 
leader in technology. The bill reauthorized the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, which regulates weights and measures, and funded government 
research to benefit specific enterprises such as steel. 
</P>
<P>
Its most disputed feature was funding of the Advanced Technology Program, which 
provides federal grants to help entrepreneurs develop new technologies. The 
bill authorized nearly $400 million over three years for ATP, compared to only 
$10 million annually recommended by President Bush, who prefers private funding 
of such ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Robert A. Roe (D-N.J.) said the government "cannot afford to wait one 
minute longer" to keep America competitive with the Japanese and Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) said spending too much on ATP means "trading 
off core research for essentially a new program that in some cases could be 
handouts." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to pass the bill.

Drugs and Driver's Licenses 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 331 to 88, the House adopted an amendment inducing states to 
suspend the driver's licenses of drug criminals. States not doing so would lose 
2% of their federal highway funds. The amendment was attached to a fiscal 1991 
transportation appropriations bill (HR 5229). 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Gene Taylor (D-Miss.) said, "At times we have to forget about things 
like states' rights and address the horrible drug problem in our nation." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) objected to "sort of a blackmail attitude of 
withholding federal highway funds because states do not pass certain laws." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was for the amendment.

<P>
NORTHRIDGE: SELF-CONTAINMENT, ACCESSIBILITY AND SHOPPING INVITE THE VISION OF A

Don and Reva Sims were driving around one day on the other side of the San 
Fernando Valley from their crowded neighborhood -- "Just to see if there was 
anything we liked out there," said Reva -- when they fell in love with the wide 
open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1967 and the area was Northridge, in the northwest valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to find more open spaces," said Reva, 56. Looking at a new 
four-bedroom, 2,200-square-foot tract home above Rinaldi Street, she said they 
liked the winding streets on the side of the mountain and the clean air. "And 
it was convenient to almost everything." 
</P>
<P>
Don Sims, 61, had other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"With three kids, our existing house was too small," he said. "We were looking 
for a larger area and when we checked into this house, they only wanted 5% 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Today, their children are grown and have moved out, but Reva, a retired real 
estate salesperson and Don, an economics teacher for the Los Angeles Community 
College District, are remodeling the kitchen of their 23-year-old house and 
converting a bedroom into an office. 
</P>
<P>
"We still love the area," Reva said. "If we came across this house and this 
neighborhood today, it would still be ideal." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, part of the city of Los Angeles, is bordered by Chatsworth on the 
west, Reseda to the south and Granada Hills on the east and north, along with a 
bit of the quickly growing Porter Ranch area nestled at the base of the Santa 
Susana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The community was originally known as Zelzah in the early 1900s, when it had a 
predominantly rural agriculture atmosphere. Even after a name change to North 
Los Angeles in the 1930s, the area retained its rustic ways. The name 
Northridge came in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
World War II, which so drastically changed Los Angeles as a whole, had little 
impact on Northridge. As large housing tracts began taking over valley farmland 
in the late 1940s, Northridge remained a favorite spot for celebrities to buy 
ranches or stable their horses. At one time, Northridge was considered the 
horse capital of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the 1950s and early 1960s that affordable mass housing made 
inroads. It's location played a big role in that development. 
</P>
<P>
"Northridge is ideal for its central valley location," said Randy diSimone, 34, 
a real estate agent in R.R. Gable's Northridge office. "Once you're familiar 
with the area you don't need to leave Northridge for anything . . . and you get 
a lot of home for the money." 
</P>
<P>
It was value that led David Peck, 39, and Gail Pine, 45, to check Northridge 
when they were house hunting last year. 
</P>
<P>
What they found was a 1968 ranch house with five bedrooms, 3 1/2 baths, formal 
dining room, living room and built-ins. Peck and Pine paid $574,000 for it, 
moving in last October. 
</P>
<P>
"The area is lovely," said Peck, owner of an amusement game company. "We were 
looking for a house that had land, that was very important to me. I love a nice 
back yard, an area where I can put in a little volleyball net." 
</P>
<P>
And that's exactly what the couple found on a 15,500-square-foot corner lot in 
what is known as the Patrician Hills tract. "The houses are older, but they're 
built with lath and plaster," Peck said. "They have quality." 
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't mind being farther away from his office than when he lived in 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"It's five miles farther than before but 20 minutes quicker to get to work," he 
said, "but it's not congested here, and I can hear the birds chirping." 
</P>
<P>
Most Northridge new home buyers in 1967, when the Sims bought, were white, but 
Reva says that now "it has become a blend of backgrounds and a cultural melting 
pot, mostly professional people, or they own their own businesses. They're 
probably in their middle to late 30s with small children. It's great to see 
younger people revitalize an area." 
</P>
<P>
She said homes on her block that sold new for $35,000 are now hovering in the 
$400,000 price range. 
</P>
<P>
Raoul and Jan Roth have seen a similar rise in home prices. Purchasing a 
2,000-square-foot home for $38,000 in Northridge in 1972. Raoul, an attorney, 
and Jan, a secretary in the aerospace industry, are still buoyant about their 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost small 'townish' here," said Raoul Roth, 55. "I know almost 
everybody on our street. They watch our house and we watch theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Since moving in, the Roth's have expanded their 2 1/2-bath, four-bedroom home 
considerably, adding another 1,250 square feet with a family room, library, 
another bathroom, another bedroom and a utility room. It was recently appraised 
at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
"When you live somewhere 18 years you know your neighbors and see people your 
kids went to school with," said Jan, 47. "I'm comfortable in Northridge and I 
like it here. Plain and simple." 
</P>
<P>
And as the area has filled, Northridge has become a major shopping area for the 
northwest valley, including the 215-store Northridge Fashion Center complex at 
Tampa Avenue and Nordhoff Street. 
</P>
<P>
Light industry has also found Northridge attractive, and the community is the 
home of aerospace subcontractor Teledyne Systems Co., which designed its 
facility not only to blend in with the community, but to pay homage to the 
Northridge of yesterday by retaining as many of the picturesque grapefruit 
trees as possible when the land was purchased in the early 1960s. It was 
Teledyne that brought Lonnie McQueen, 59, and his wife, Regina, to buy a home 
in Northridge in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After working for Ford Aerospace in Newport Beach, Lonnie took advantage of an 
early retirement plan and moved to France for 18 months. An offer to return to 
the aerospace industry brought him back to Southern California and the pair 
bought a three-bedroom, three-bath, 1,600-square-foot townhouse for $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was foolish to pay rent when we could afford to buy a home," said Lonnie. 
"Besides, the shopping in this area is fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Single-family homes range from $210,000 for a three-bedroom, one-bath, 
1,300-square-foot tract home to a 4,000-square-foot $800,000 design with five 
bedrooms, said realtor Kathy Greenwood with the Northridge office of Fred 
Sands. 
</P>
<P>
Condominiums without a garage start about $155,000 and jump $50,000 for the 
privilege of parking off the street. 
</P>
<P>
And even if they don't know where Northridge is, high school seniors hoping to 
enter a four-year college or university system all know about CSUN -- 
California State University at, you guessed it, Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 31,000 full-time students packed into 353 acres, CSUN, located 
on Nordhoff Street between Reseda Boulevard and Zelzah Avenue, offers 47 
undergraduate major degrees and 39 masters degrees, and is large enough to have 
its own ZIP code. It is also the state headquarters for the National Center on 
Deafness. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor for David Peck in choosing a home in Northridge was the leisure 
activities it offered, especially his ability to relax with a bicycle ride. "I 
like flat areas to bicycle," he said. "The streets here are just lovely, wide 
and scenic." 
</P>
<P>
"And I wanted a formal dining room that could seat 12 to 14 people 
comfortably," said Gail Pine. "I like a den, not a family room and a kitchen. 
I'm old-fashioned like that. I'm more traditional." 
</P>
<P>
Residents such as the Sims, who have stayed in Northridge because of the 
convenience and the ability to reach almost every part of the valley within a 
few minutes, are amazed at what demand and other factors have done to increase 
the value of their property. 
</P>
<P>
"Even being in the real estate business, it's mind-boggling to see how home 
prices have escalated today," Reva said. "And the increased values have kept 
the various Northridge neighborhoods in great shape. When you're spending 
$300,000 to $600,000 for a home, you're determined to take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Northridge is going to be like Westwood," said realtor Greenwood. 
"It's got the college, it's close to freeways and we have a million different 
ways to get to where you are going. You have a lot of choices here."

UC IRVINE STUDENT TO HONE HER ACTIVISM AS STUDENT REGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINA LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Jenny Doh and her family emigrated to Bakersfield from Korea in 1974, 
their arrival was heralded by a banner headline and story on the front page of 
the local paper. 
</P>
<P>
But though civic leaders welcomed the city's first Korean family, other 
children's curiosity was painful to the gregarious 7-year-old, who suddenly 
found herself among blond, blue-eyed youngsters demanding to know why her eyes 
were so oddly shaped and her nose so flat. 
</P>
<P>
"I just shut up; I turned inward," the 23-year-old UC Irvine senior said, 
wincing at the memory. By high school, though, Doh emerged from her shell. She 
began to take pride in her Korean heritage, her academic and artistic 
abilities, and became one of the leaders at her school. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the first Asian and first UCI student appointed to serve on the 
University of California Board of Regents, the self-described radical feminist 
said her mission is to be an effective voice for students, and especially for 
women and ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
It is a remarkable opportunity -- a victory, really -- for the young political 
science major who two years ago lost an ego-bruising campaign for UCI's student 
body presidency to emerge as the most prominent student in the nine-campus UC 
system. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Doh helped organize a student coalition that sought more minority 
representation in UCI's Associated Students group. Movement of University 
Students for Effective Lobbying backed her unsuccessful bid for AS president. 
The movement was later named 1989's outstanding political organization on any 
University of California campus by the statewide Associated Students group. 
</P>
<P>
"I may lose, but in the process, I try to get my voice heard," explained Doh, 
who became an official voting regent at last week's meeting in Santa Cruz. "And 
this (being student regent) is an opportunity to get my oar in the water." 
</P>
<P>
By appearance, she would hardly be taken for a radical. 
</P>
<P>
At the regents meetings, where decorum is studiously observed and the public is 
kept at a distance, she conveys confidence and seriousness. She is always 
attired in conservative business suits. Her shoulder-length black hair is 
neatly trimmed. Only a waist-length braid at the nape of her neck belies the 
corporate image. 
</P>
<P>
And while Doh views herself as a crusader for the oppressed, her style has 
evolved into one of building on common interests that some say portends a 
future in public service or politics. 
</P>
<P>
Serving as UCI's student ombudsman last year has helped, said UCI campus 
ombudsman Ronald Wilson, who offered Doh the student job when she lost the 
campus president's race. 
</P>
<P>
"She has grown in the last year," he said. "That fire is still there, but it is 
now tempered with reason, with the ability to look at both sides of an issue 
rather than the side most appealing to her. 
</P>
<P>
"Make no mistake, Jenny is a politician. And I say that in the most positive 
sense. . . . In fact, I told her, 'I expect to see you as the second woman 
governor of California (after his choice for the upcoming race, Dianne 
Feinstein) or the first woman President,' " said Wilson, who with his family 
has taken Doh under his wing. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, radicals among the 15 previous student regents have had trouble 
being taken seriously when they were perceived as too strident or identified 
too closely with the UC students association, especially in the wake of student 
protests in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Lynn Mock, the first student regent, compared the post to walking a 
tightrope, saying that it was never clear whether she was to be a regular 
trustee or a student representative on the 26-member board. 
</P>
<P>
"At times, the (UC) student body council wanted the student regent to be their 
voice. And at times, the regents wanted that too. The problem is that one 
person cannot be representative of 130,000 students," said Mock, a senior at UC 
Santa Barbara when she was named to the Board of Regents in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at the time what her goals were, she was widely quoted as saying: "Not to 
be the last student regent." 
</P>
<P>
That angered some of the more radical UC students, recalled Mock, now 37 and an 
assistant professor of political science at the University of Illinois in 
Champaign. 
</P>
<P>
Mock is generally credited with deftly negotiating the tightrope on a Board of 
Regents dominated by conservatives, thereby ensuring the future of the 
student's seat. 
</P>
<P>
"If the first student regent wasn't so effective, the board may not have 
continued to have one," said Bonnie Smotony, secretary to the regents. 
</P>
<P>
Still, over the years, many members have tended to regard the student they 
select as a "special-interest regent . . . (who was) only representing 
students, and that what they said therefore ought to be discounted," said 
former regent Vilma S. Martinez, a prominent Los Angeles attorney whose 14-year 
stint on the board ended in March. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was an unfair charge," she said. "They bring a perspective and 
talent which the rest of us simply don't have. They are students who are on a 
campus daily. They know what's going on. . . . I always listened very carefully 
to what they had to say." 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine's 1990 Student Body President, Todd Schubert, said Doh is savvy 
enough to realize she must "earn the respect" of fellow regents if she wants to 
convey her views effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"Jenny will keep that in mind and work well with the group, and at the same 
time advocate students' views," predicted Schubert, 21, a senior majoring in 
social ecology with an emphasis on criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
Issues of concern to Doh are quality education, support -- financial and 
otherwise -- for students and cultural diversity. That's why she chose the 
regents' special committee on affirmative action as one of her assignments 
during her one-year term. She also serves on the educational policy, grounds 
and buildings, and hospital governance committees. 
</P>
<P>
As student regent, she said, she knows she'll have to balance the university's 
budget realities against her radicalism and desire to help students and boost 
support for women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, because I do understand what the dollars mean and how important it 
is to make the (budget) numbers balance." At the same time, she said, scrimping 
on education doesn't pay, asserting that California's economic health depends 
on educating its people. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't argue that we (University of California students) are getting a great 
education at an affordable price. But what is a public institution's purpose if 
not to provide education for the public?" 
</P>
<P>
Doh, who postponed graduation a year to be student regent, said she plans to 
get a graduate degree in women's studies. "I want to study where I can write 
about women's oppression, radical feminism and issues of public policy, like 
equal pay and child care," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When she's not studying or crusading, she's like any other college student -- 
joking around, socializing with friends, listening to music and watching the 
latest movies. "Steel Magnolias" was a special favorite of hers, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
She also plays the cello, piano and guitar. Yet the earnest crusader emerges 
even in her music. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he stumbled on Doh and his 10-year-old daughter playing the folk 
protest song, "We Shall Overcome." 
</P>
<P>
Some past student regents were criticized by their peers as being too 
interested in having the job on their resumes and making future professional 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Yamaguchi, an employee for UC Students Associated, which yearly selects 
the three student regent finalists, said Doh is unlikely to be one of those. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times you get to be student regent and you see yourself as somewhat 
exalted," said Yamaguchi. "Jenny still sees herself as one of the real people. 
She has no problems being a kid." 
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's session at UC Santa Cruz, the usual elegant reception was 
planned for all the regents, top UC officials, the university chancellors and 
their spouses at a nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Doh ducked out in jeans and T-shirt and went with Yamaguchi and former student 
regent Jaquelyn Ross of UC Davis in search of more modest fare. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what she would want to say of her term in office a year from now, the 
bespectacled young woman knitted her brow and looked past the crowd gathered on 
the Santa Cruz wharf. "To have remained true to my beliefs and the interests of 
students, and have had the other regents listen to me."

LONG BEACH RIDES THE BLUE LINE TO GLORY; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: METRO RAIL HAS ALREADY PAID OFF IN NATIONAL EXPOSURE AND URBAN PERKS. 
AND IT'S COST THE CITY SCARCELY A DIME.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fireworks popped, horns blared, a crowd cheered and the eyes of the country 
watched as Los Angeles, in one of its proudest moments, prepared to take its 
place in modern light-rail transportation history. 
</P>
<P>
Then out of a dark tunnel came a sleek, white, state-of-the-art train -- with 
Long Beach written all over it. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro Rail line may be an $877-million gamble for Los Angeles, but for Long 
Beach the gamble has already paid off in priceless national exposure and urban 
perks that are making old Iowa by the Sea look almost cosmopolitan. And all of 
it has cost the city scarcely a dime. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't put a dollar amount of that kind of publicity," Assistant City 
Manager John Shirey said. "That's something a city can't buy." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best press we've ever had!" a downtown business association 
official crowed. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend in Florida called to say he saw Long Beach on the news three times," 
City Councilman Ray Grabinski rejoiced. "This is like a nice cool breeze on a 
hot day." 
</P>
<P>
At Norm's restaurant along the Long Beach Boulevard route, business has boomed 
since the Blue Line made its maiden voyage eight days ago. 
</P>
<P>
"People from downtown in business suits rode into Long Beach just to get out of 
the office. At lunch Monday, I was packed," manager Dennis Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Early reviews were less enthusiastic at video stores, dry cleaners and doughnut 
shops, where proprietors said the long-awaited boom was more like a thud. The 
only impact on business in the shopping center across from Wardlow Station is a 
parking shortage caused by commuters who leave their cars in the lot all day. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to go and run them off," liquor store proprietor Frank Vallier grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
But even inside the Quality Do-nut shop -- which hasn't sold a single 
additional doughnut since the Blue Line started running, its manager said -- a 
transit map and a glitzy poster of the train are pinned to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
People all over the nation are hearing about the new toy in car-worshiping Los 
Angeles County. And anyone hearing about that is hearing about Long Beach, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The town that has worked furiously to trade its country bumpkin reputation for 
international image has, it seems, been nudged ever closer to big-city status 
-- mostly at the expense of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 
that is paying the light-rail bill. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing represents the keys to the county, and they are in the palm of our 
hands," Grabinski said. "The possibilities are endless." 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, it seemed that Long Beach was blessed when it came to Metro 
Rail, the three-legged, 150-mile system scheduled for completion in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
When the project's designers were deciding which leg to build first, they found 
16 miles of track from the old Pacific Electric Red Car's Long Beach line ripe 
for renovation and started there. 
</P>
<P>
When a drawing was held to decide which of the county's 85 cities should be the 
namesake of the first Metro Rail car -- the one that would greet the world with 
a cargo of assorted dignitaries on the first official ride -- they pulled Long 
Beach out of the hat. 
</P>
<P>
"The gods were with us," Shirey said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city is mostly celebrating now, it took more than divine 
providence to sell Long Beach on the idea of Metro Rail in the early days. 
</P>
<P>
The business community was skeptical. Some merchants went so far as to sue the 
county to block construction of the Blue Line that runs through North Long 
Beach along Long Beach Boulevard and into the heart of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The county took great pains to win the city over, even moving 500 Long Beach 
Boulevard palm trees to a tree farm for two years, then replanting them when 
construction was complete. 
</P>
<P>
In time, most of Long Beach not only learned to love light rail but to 
capitalize on it. The city has spent at least two years advertising the Blue 
Line in promotional brochures and videotapes. Officials contend that the line 
has already helped the reviving downtown area shake off some of its urban 
blight by attracting major developers and elegant hotels to the light rail's 
doorstep in the downtown loop, scheduled to open in September. 
</P>
<P>
City officials predict that home values will soar as commuters, tired of the 
drive, move to Long Beach to take advantage of the only operating leg of a 
transit network that remains mostly under construction. 
</P>
<P>
The city has begun a full-scale review of tired and decrepit Long Beach 
Boulevard, where most of the local stations are located, in anticipation of 
vigorous redevelopment because of the Blue Line that runs down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time," Grabinski said, "Long Beach was right there with Los 
Angeles. We had the Pike, the world's greatest amusement park, and the Red Car, 
the world's greatest transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the Blue Line is like an artery pumping life right back into our city." 
</P>

business is slow despite advent of rail traffic. RICK CORRALES / Los Angeles 
Times; Photo, BLUE LINE: The Metro Rail has brought not only trains filled with 
commuters to Long Beach, but the kind of national exposure that city officials 
say can't be bought. Dennis Schroeder, above, manager of Norm's on Long Beach 
Boulevard, said restaurant business picked up markedly thanks to Blue Line.

A POLITICAL ENIGMA BOWS OUT IN FAMILIAR FASHION; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: IN ONE OF HER LAST LONG BEACH CITY COUNCIL VOTES, JAN HALL PLAYED THE 
TOUGH GUY, TYPICAL OF WHAT PEOPLE LOVE AND HATE ABOUT HER.

<P>
In one of her last controversial votes, Councilwoman Jan Hall scanned the crowd 
of irate boat owners filling the council chambers last month and coolly let 
them know that she was not on their side. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe every element in our community is going to have to be hurt a bit 
because of the financial situation the city is in, and I don't think the marina 
should be any different," she said in explaining her support for marina fee 
increases they vehemently oppose. 
</P>
<P>
Her tough-guy, don't-fool-with-me demeanor was typical of what people love and 
hate about Hall, who this month left the council to devote her energies to a 
private consulting job after three terms representing the affluent and 
ever-contentious 3rd District. 
</P>
<P>
"Jan is a very absolute person," said Pam Briley, a realtor and political 
supporter of Hall's. "She's not wishy-washy and mealy-mouthed. She won't walk 
away from you, leaving you with the impression that she agrees with you if she 
doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
Nel Meckna, who has been a friend of Hall's since their days in the PTA decades 
ago, said: "I think she has the guts to (take a stand), and a lot of people 
don't like that. They want her to say, 'Yes, we'll do it that way,' and that's 
not the answer they get." 
</P>
<P>
Bright, hard-working and complex, Hall throughout her 12-year City Council 
career stirred strong and conflicting emotions in those who dealt with her. 
Politically, she can be an enigma. In many ways a conservative Republican, she 
is nonetheless an ardent advocate of abortion rights and has been a key "yes" 
vote on local gay-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no neutrals when it comes to Jan Hall," Briley noted with a chuckle. 
"The only neutrals are the people who have never heard of her." 
</P>
<P>
Easily one of the most intelligent and articulate members of the City Council 
during her tenure, Hall, 47, is lauded by friends as a warm person and gutsy 
politician with an impressive grasp of issues and an amazing ability to recall 
facts and figures. 
</P>
<P>
Her detractors describe her as intolerant and snide, and complain that she was 
wedded to the many homeowner groups who wield power in her district and was 
also too politically ambitious for the district's good. 
</P>
<P>
"Jan is absolutely wonderful in front of people," said John Blowitz who, as 
owner and publisher of two community weeklies, has long been at odds with Hall. 
"She's knowledgeable. She's glib. She's folksy. . . . (But) behind the scenes, 
she really stomps on people, and she treats them very aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
Blowitz will butt heads with her no more. After three terms representing what 
is arguably the prickliest council district in the city, Hall decided she had 
had enough. She took a private consulting job last winter, announced that she 
would not be a candidate for another council term and made a controversial exit 
from the regional transit board, on which she had served for nearly nine years. 
Last week her successor, Doug Drummond, took her place on the council. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to her future, she rules out nothing. "I don't know what is going 
to happen in my life," said Hall, whose world has long extended beyond the 
boundaries of her shoreline district. 
</P>
<P>
She was until January a board member of the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District, the state Commission on the Status of Women, recently made an 
unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination in the 58th Assembly District 
and in 1988 sought the new full-time mayor's position. 
</P>
<P>
For all her political ambitions, Hall devoted her council time to district 
matters, largely forsaking broader social or citywide issues. She lists as her 
achievements such projects as a new fire station, money for local parks and a 
rebuilt boardwalk on the Long Beach Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a philosophical approach to local government," said 
Hall, who recently talked about her council tenure at her kitchen table, a 
cordless telephone and cigarettes by her side. "It's very real. If your trash 
isn't picked up, it's not philosophical." 
</P>
<P>
There was no shortage of things to attend to in her district, which simmers 
with politically active groups harboring strong and often-divisive opinions on 
land-use and neighborhood issues. 
</P>
<P>
She said she received five death threats during her council career, once opened 
her front door to find 320 pounds of bagged manure stacked on her porch and 
routinely heard her garbage cans strewn across the road in the middle of the 
night by people venting anger at some decision. 
</P>
<P>
"My son used to wake up and say, 'What did you do today?,' " said Hall, who has 
reared four children with her husband, insurance broker Jack Hall, whom she 
left college to marry. 
</P>
<P>
One of just a handful of women to serve on the City Council, Hall was for her 
last term the lone woman on the council, which again became an all-male club 
with her departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a real reality that I can't go to the men's room," Hall mused. 
"I used to tease them. They'd come out (of the bathroom) and say, 'Great idea,' 
and I didn't know what the idea was. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was always a threat. I should be home, cooking dinner, which I 
always did -- and they never had to." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wallace Edgerton, a frequent ally of Hall's, said: "Jan is a tough 
fighter. But I still think there's a certain handicap for a lone woman among 
eight men who are aggressive. . . . I think there's still a subconscious 
unwillingness on the part of many males to accept a woman as an equal." 
</P>
<P>
To counter her exclusion from the male network, Hall said she "worked twice as 
hard," arming herself with information she culled from documents and city staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"She worked closer with the city staff than probably any other council member, 
including the mayor," said Irene Day, a former aide of Hall's, who remembered 
her former boss as a voracious reader and a productive worker. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted very much to sit down, get to the bottom of it . . . and move onto 
other business," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually everyone who has worked at any length with Hall has an anecdote about 
her ability to absorb and retain facts, however minute. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a phenomenal grasp on even the smallest detail," said Stanley Green, a 
community activist in Belmont Heights. "People could bring up a muddy spot on a 
bike path and she would know the history of how the bike trail came into 
existence and . . . the bureaucratic background of what department should and 
should not deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, when Hall was president of a PTA and Meckna was the secretary, a 
typist lost the group's minutes for the whole year. "I called her and told 
her," Meckna recalled. "She said, 'No problem,' and she sat right down and we 
went over the whole year. She was able to recap all that." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the strongest criticism of Hall is voiced by businessmen in her 
district, who said she ignored their concerns because many of them do not live 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was a difference between a business person and a person who voted, it 
always went to the person who voted," one business owner grumbled. "She went 
with the people who walked the streets with her, . . . whoever does the most 
for Jan. . . . That's what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Hall angrily dismissed the business complaints: "I think that's the great lie. 
. . . I worked with them like crazy and put in hours that no one should have to 
put in if you're only going to go with the homeowners." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her conservatism, Hall won the grudging gratitude of a local gay 
Democratic club. "We could never endorse Jan Hall, because she would never come 
out and openly support issues that were important to our community," said David 
Newell of Long Beach's Lambda Democratic Club. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, there were at least two occasions when she was the key 
fifth vote, and we would have lost it without her," Newell added, referring to 
council votes on the local lesbian and gay pride festival and an 
anti-discrimination ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
She was attacked for her abortion-rights stance during the Assembly race and 
sparred repeatedly with anti-abortionists. "When they are willing to curtail 
the ability to have a vasectomy, then maybe we can talk," retorted Hall, who is 
rarely at a loss for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
At a political forum last spring, she looked incredulous when an anti-abortion 
activist challenged her support for government money for abortions by asking 
her whether that meant women had a right to publicly funded face lifts. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, fixing an icy stare on her inquisitor, told him that his analogy was 
absurd and that he clearly had no idea what it was like to be pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been pregnant 10 times," she said pointedly. She later explained that she 
has suffered six miscarriages. 
</P>
<P>
She also encountered controversy on the transit board, where she won the 
respect of colleagues for steering the agency through a series of scandals 
while president of the board. But relations soured when she resigned from the 
board to take the consulting job, which calls for her to lobby on behalf of the 
RTD in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Her jump from the board to a lucrative job representing the agency stirred 
public criticism; the board canceled the lobbying contract. 
</P>
<P>
Hall remains with the consulting firm, which primarily helps developers obtain 
government permits for projects. 
</P>
<P>
Hall has told friends that she is happy to turn her energies to the private 
sector. As for her public life, she said: "I fought for what I thought was 
right, and if that made people angry, you know what? I don't feel bad."

CITY MOBILIZES AGAINST LATEST NEW GANG PRESENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the last several months, evidence of increased gang activity has appeared 
in this mostly industrial city of fewer than 13,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
The graffiti of one gang were on a mailbox outside City Hall last week. The 
markings of other gangs tag an alley behind apartments and duplexes where a 
reputed gang member lives. 
</P>
<P>
A youth at a city park was dressed last week in black and silver, wearing black 
sneakers with a white stripe -- standard gang attire. 
</P>
<P>
The signs are scarce in contrast with neighboring East Los Angeles, or in such 
Southeast cities as Huntington Park and Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
But Commerce officials say they are not waiting for matters to worsen. They are 
gearing up a largely preventive anti-gang program, similar to one begun in 1982 
and allowed to expire when the gang threat diminished. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted Tuesday to establish an anti-gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last seven years, we've had the luxury of being pretty much gang 
free," said Robert Chavez, the city's social services manager and coordinator 
of the renewed anti-gang effort. "The problems went away. It stopped." 
</P>
<P>
There are six small gangs in Commerce, Sheriff's Lt. Robert Hoffman said. The 
largest is called the Choppers, which boasts 40 to 50 members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said city officials are especially concerned about what appears to be a 
new and growing crop of gang members, about 20 to 25 youths 13 to 16 years old. 
Several of those youths are recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a group of kids . . . that has moved in from different areas, different 
barrios," Chavez said. "They're bringing in their outside influences." 
</P>
<P>
An increase in graffiti is the most noticeable result, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gang-related crime rates have remained fairly stable. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-nine gang-related crimes have been committed so far this year, Hoffman 
said. There were 53 gang-related crimes for the same period of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is that in 1989 there were just 17 serious crimes committed by 
gangs, and 26 during 1990. Serious crimes this year include one kidnaping, six 
assaults with deadly weapons, four burglaries and two robberies, according to 
Sheriff's Department statistics. There were no gang killings in either year. 
</P>
<P>
City and law enforcement officials said Commerce must move quickly before the 
problem mushrooms. "There is an increase in the activity, there's no doubt 
about that," said Sheriff's Sgt. Mike Allen, who is assigned to Commerce. "Any 
increase should be taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen James B. Dimas and Artemio E. Navarro are part of the anti-gang 
unit, which will also include law enforcement and school officials. 
</P>
<P>
The city has already started a parent information program. The program includes 
notifying parents when their children have been involved in such gang-related 
activity as scrawling graffiti on walls. Truancy, drug and alcohol use, theft 
and vandalism are also reported to parents. 
</P>
<P>
The city held a community forum July 13 to give residents the lastest 
information on the gang problem and how to tell whether a child is involved in 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-gang unit could dust off employment and other programs used eight 
years ago to quell gang activity. The employment program included incentives to 
encourage employers to hire local youths to keep them off the streets. Commerce 
paid half of the youths' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we're an industrial area, we're going to be working to develop more 
jobs for that age when nobody wants to hire them -- 14 to 16," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
The results of a youth mural program still adorn a wall at Bristow Park, which 
is surrounded by a neighborhood that has been the center of most of the city's 
gang activity. Some Chopper members helped paint the mural years ago, Chavez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce officials will also try to channel more youth into sports and 
recreation programs offered by the city. Commerce has a strong tax base because 
of its industry, so most of those programs are free to residents. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the city's small number of residents, many of whom have lived there 
for decades, Commerce officials are confident that they can combat the new gang 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
"At this stage it can be controlled, as long as we work on it as a community, 
together," Chavez said.

Sports truck drivers Ivan Stewart and Walker Evans played like a couple of 
little boys in the dirt at the Mickey Thompson Off-Road Championship Gran Prix 
in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 45, won the opening heat race in his Toyota, moving up from the third 
row on the starting line to take the lead on the third lap. 
</P>
<P>
He staged a tight duel with Evans, 51, for the lead for four laps before 
claiming the eight-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 51, won the second heat race in his Jeep as Stewart desperately tried to 
find a way to get around him. The crowd of 46,347 roared with every move that 
Stewart attempted, but he had to settle for second place. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said he made the right decision in taking the inside line up the 
peristyle jump in holding off Evans in the first heat. "The inside track is 
definitely faster," Stewart said. "It took me a while to figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to try a different racing line to get around Walker in the second heat, 
but he figured out the fastest way after the first heat." 
</P>
<P>
ROger Mears, who has won only tow main events in the past three years, was 
competitive in his Nissan despite mechanical problems. Mears finished fourth in 
the first heat despite losing his brakes and then was third in the second heat, 
passing Danny Thompson at the checkered flag.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting in the middle of the restaurant Friday afternoon, having lunch hours 
before his team would lose yet another game, Greg Riddoch's eyes were 
transfixed. 
</P>
<P>
Across the room was an aquarium containing live lobsters, and Riddoch kept 
looking at it until the parallel finally hit him. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, he said, "that's kind of like me. There's a lobster sitting in cool 
water, just relaxing and letting the water go through its gills. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, all of a sudden, someone snatches it and throws it in a pot of scalding 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"It deadens your senses right away." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, in the midst of all of this, Gregory Lee Riddoch still is able to 
laugh. Well, outwardly, at least. His insides are bubbling to a point where he 
already has lost five pounds, and he has been on the job only 11 days. Welcome 
to the Padre manager's chair, where your dream, too, can turn into a living 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have won just one game since Riddoch was promoted as manager July 
11, losing games in ways that have even Little League kids wincing. It has 
gotten so bad that instead of Riddoch consoling players, they're consoling him. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so bad for Greg," Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst said, "No one deserves 
this. We're just playing awful, and it's not his fault at all." 
</P>
<P>
Said first baseman Jack Clark: "It takes a lot of guts for him to take this 
over. I think he's doing a super job. He's pushing the right buttons, but we're 
the ones letting him down." 
</P>
<P>
This, more than anything, reveals the respect and intimacy Riddoch has with his 
players. The players are well aware Riddoch was hired as a manager only through 
the end of the season and that managers with a .125 winning percentage don't 
tend to stick around for long. But please, they say, give the man a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe we have the right man for the job," right fielder Tony Gwynn 
said. "It's so tough for him to right the ship when it's sinking, but I really 
believe if anyone can, it's Greg. I know he's not going to give up, he'll fight 
to the end." 
</P>
<P>
You would think that a man who has just 10 weeks left to prove to his owners 
that he's right for the job would be panicking. He should be acting as if he's 
waiting a last-minute stay-of-execution call from the governor, but instead, 
it's as if he's waiting for the President to call and chit-chat. He's been 
calm, almost serene, during this rash of defeats. 
</P>
<P>
You want him to criticize one of his players, ripping him to sheds in the 
fashion that would give Dick Williams goose bumps. Uh-uh. 
</P>
<P>
You want him to stand in the middle of the clubhouse and scream some sense into 
them, stealing a page from one of Larry Bowa's leftover speeches. Nope. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to ever hear me criticize one of my players through the 
paper," Riddoch said, "Never. That's not my style. When something needs to be 
said, it'll be done between me and the player, and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
This is why, when Riddoch became so fed up with second baseman Roberto Alomar's 
recent nonchalant style of play, he called him into his office, shut the door 
and proceeded to talk with him until after the team bus had left, benching him 
for two days. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch made it clear that if the players wanted to continue to make stupid 
mistakes on the field, go ahead, but they'll have to keep opening their wallets 
every time, too. He installed a Kangaroo Court, complete with three judges, 
with all fines going to the San Diego Children's' Hospital. At the rate fines 
are being assessed, the hospital should be renamed in the Padres' honor any day 
now. 
</P>
<P>
He has had separate meetings with Clark and Gwynn, trying to repress the 
clubhouse feuds and cliques. He also is meeting individually with each player 
on the team, listening to their complaints, annoyances and suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
It's going to take time, maybe more than Padre fans imagine, but inroads are 
being made into the heart of the team's problems. 
</P>
<P>
It's still unknown, of course, just how long Riddoch will be able to continue 
his first-aid effort. He has a managerial contract through the end of the 
season. If Padre chairman Tom Werner likes what he sees, he'll exercise the 
option that will pay Riddoch about $180,000 next season. If Werner wants 
someone else, Riddoch has been guaranteed that he will continue as a coach, for 
about $100,000 less. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seems to be going wrong right now," Werner said, "but I'm not going 
to judge Greg on some of the problems he inherited. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very clearly a guy who is aware of the problems on the team, and has some 
solutions to solve them. I feel this is a step in the right direction. He's a 
good motivator and teacher, and I think he's in the mold of a Tom Trebelhorn 
(of Milwaukee) and Tony LaRussa (of Oakland). 
</P>
<P>
"I believed in Greg when we chose him. And I still believe in him." 
</P>
<P>
Funny, that's what everybody's saying about the guy. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a wonderful way of making life enjoyable for people surrounding him," 
said Tom Runnells, third base coach of the Montreal Expos, who played for 
Riddoch in high school. "I've never seen anything like it. He has a way of 
getting people to enjoy coming to the park and wanting to work, but he has the 
ability to get everything out of youngsters and veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind that he'll turn around that team. Once they get 
going, there's no looking back." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch, who has spent his life working in almost every facet of baseball, 
seems to make an indelible impression on everyone he encounters. Why else would 
a man receive 55 congratulatory messages on his hotel phone the night he 
received the job, and about 40 more calls and telegrams the next day? 
</P>
<P>
There was one man in particular who was so exuberant at the news that he 
thought he was going to cry. His name? 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis, All-Star outfielder of the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
They first met in 1981. Davis had just graduated from Fremont High School, an 
inner-city school in Los Angeles, and was leaving home for the first time in 
his life. He went to Eugene, Ore., where he was assigned as an eighth-round 
draft choice of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Well, after batting .219 with one homer and 11 RBIs in 33 games, Davis wanted 
out. He had basketball scholarships awaiting at Arizona State and Pepperdine. 
Who needed this aggravation? 
</P>
<P>
"I was really unhappy," he said. "But every day he kept talking to me. He kept 
telling me not to give up. I think everybody was down on me, but Greg, he not 
only battled for me, he went to war for me. 
</P>
<P>
"He's made such an impression on me that he'll always be special in my life. 
He's like a part of family now. I'd do anything for that man. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me put it like this, if it wasn't for Greg Riddoch, I wouldn't be here 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
Almost 10 years to the day after Riddoch first managed him in short-season 
Class-A ball, Davis will face Riddoch the manager for first time Monday in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
And who knows just what would have happened if Davis had known Riddoch would 
manage the Padres? Would Davis still have signed a three-year, $9million 
contract in the off-season? Or would he have waited until the end of the season 
and signed with the Padres as a free agent, curing their center-field woes. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, don't ask me that one, that's a tough one," Davis said, laughing. "Well, 
let me put it this way, if Lou (Piniella) had not been here, and Pete (Rose) 
had stayed here, I think it would have been a strong possibility I would have 
gone there." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the secret to understanding Riddoch's charm with people who come in 
contact with him is looking at this background. 
</P>
<P>
This is a self-made man through and through. Life never has been easy. He never 
knew his real father and wasn't close to his stepfather. He was reared in 
California and attended Garden Grove High School. 
</P>
<P>
For those of the '63 graduating class who are trying to remember him, take out 
your yearbook and look under the name of Greg Bezlij. That was the last name of 
his stepfather. It wasn't until several years later that he reverted to his 
natural father's name. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, Riddoch isn't the most publicized graduate of the class. A fellow 
by the name of Steve Martin, the comedian/actor, also happened to be part of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I didn't even know he was so famous," Riddoch said, "until my sister 
called me up one night and said to turn on Johnny Carson. There he was. Hosting 
'The Tonight Show.' I said, 'Geez, you've got to be kidding me.' 
</P>
<P>
"This was the same guy that was a prankster all through high school. One time 
we had a substitute teacher in chemistry class. He told him pull this chain, 
that it was a bell, and everybody would come to class. 
</P>
<P>
"So he pulled it, and a bucket of water fell all over him. 
</P>
<P>
"Who'd have thought that someone would pay him to be a crack-up?" 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch went off to the University of Northern Colorado on a baseball and 
basketball scholarship and four years later was drafted and signed by 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a home-run hitter in college, but when we saw him, I don't remember him 
hitting a single one," said Dick Poole, who's now the Chicago Cubs' pitching 
coach. "He wasn't what we called a tough out." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jimmy Hoff, his minor league roommate in 1968: "We were middle infielders 
together. I played second, and Greg played shortstop. He knew everything that 
he was doing wrong, but he just couldn't correct. Besides, another shortstop 
came along at the same time, and he shot by all of us. 
</P>
<P>
"His name was Davey Concepcion." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch spent six years in the minors chasing his dream, which by his account 
was two years too long. He finally quit and became a teacher at Greeley High, 
where he helped run everything from the band to school plays to baseball to 
Special Olympics basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Howsam, the Reds' farm director, telephoned Riddoch one month later and 
asked him if he would manage one of their minor league teams during his summer 
months. Why not? Riddoch spent each summer managing in the Northwest League. 
When he was promoted to assistant principal and didn't have enough time to 
manage, he became a regional scouting supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Then one day, after watching an American Legion game in Butte, Mont., he 
returned to his hotel room and received a message from Howsam, who had retired 
in 1978 from the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Howsam: "They're going to let (General Manager) Dick Wagner go tomorrow. I want 
to refine the Big Red Machine, and I want you to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch wasn't sure what to do. He hated to uproot his family. But the more he 
listened, the more excited he became. Howsam was going to groom him to be the 
next general manager and was so sincere that he was offering him a three-year 
guaranteed contract totaling $180,000. When you're making $28,000 as a teacher, 
the decision becomes quite simple. 
</P>
<P>
Everything went fine for two years. Riddoch vaulted through the system, from 
assistant director of player development and scouting to the minor league 
director and had been told that in four months, he'd be assistant general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Well, that changed on July 7, 1985. Howsam was called in for a meeting with new 
owner Marge Schott, and it lasted more than 12 hours. By the time Howsam came 
to Riddoch's house that night for a barbecue, it was 10 o'clock. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew something was wrong," Riddoch said. "He was just so quiet the whole 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Howsam announced his retirement the next day. Schott became the new president 
and chief operating officer, Riddoch a lame duck. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way she was going to keep me around," Riddoch said. "Anyone who 
was brought in by Howsam was going to be out. We were all on our way out." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch still had a year left on his contract, but he made it easy on her. He 
resigned effective Dec. 31, 1985. He was going to work in the Seattle Mariners 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Well, just a few weeks before he was getting ready for the move, he was told 
the job wasn't available after all. 
</P>
<P>
Now what was he going to do? He already had resigned from Cincinnati. And in a 
few weeks, his paychecks would be stopping. 
</P>
<P>
Much to Riddoch's surprise, his reputation worked for him, and offers started 
coming in from all directions. It was Tom Romenesko, Padre director of player 
development, who finally wooed him. He started work on Jan. 1, 1986, as 
associate director of minor league and scouting. In seven weeks, he came 
director of the department. In eight months, he became a coach on Larry Bowa's 
staff. And now, after 3 1/2 years as coach, he's the 13th manager of the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"Kind of makes you dizzy, doesn't it?" Riddoch said. "My feet still aren't on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Who'd have thought a guy like me would be doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
The only time anyone from the Padre organization even mentioned to Riddoch the 
possibility he might become manager was during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon, who was manager and vice president/baseball operations, said to 
Riddoch: "You know, one day, I think you're going to be manager." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch: "Thanks, but, uh, if you don't mind, let's don't even talk about that 
stuff. I just want to concentrate on coaching." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon agreed not to bring it up again, and Riddoch walked away thinking that 
in three or four years, maybe he would be manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, here I am," Riddoch said, "feeling absolutely naked. But I think 
everything will work out, I really do. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be. Maybe the Good Lord is saying, 
'Greg, I never said this would be easy, but I believe you're the right man. 
I've tested you before, and I'm testing you now.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what, He's doing a pretty good job of it, isn't He?"

NIXON LIBRARY A TRIUMPH EVEN WITH OMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN E. AMBROSE, Stephen E. Ambrose, a history professor at the 
University of New Orleans, has written two volumes of a Nixon biography and is 
working on a third to be published this fall. He also was the official 
biographer for Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is much to criticize, including some lies, some continuing cover-up and 
some glaring omissions, but overall the Nixon Library and Birthplace is a 
stunning triumph. 
</P>
<P>
It is easily the best of all the presidential museums in terms of size, scope, 
coverage, use of audio and visual material, and just plain appeal to people. 
This is partly because it is the most expensive at $21 million, partly because 
it is the most imaginative in concept and design, but mainly it is because of 
the subject. Nixon's longevity in national politics and his central role in 
many of the great events of the last century combine to provide an ideal theme 
around which to build a dramatic museum. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, naturally and inevitably, dominates everything. The purpose of the 
museum is more to glorify Nixon than to explain him, as is true of every 
presidential museum. There is not a hint of criticism about anything he ever 
did. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the gift store that features Nixon as author, this is a 
library without books or manuscripts. Although some research materials are 
promised next year, the truth is the name of the establishment is deliberately 
misleading. It is not a library; it is the Richard Nixon museum. 
</P>
<P>
As such, the biggest disappointment is the treatment of Nixon and Vietnam. The 
biggest surprise is the fairly extensive, albeit one-sided, treatment given to 
Watergate. The best section is Nixon's early life and campaigns. The most 
appealing segments cover Pat Nixon and family life. 
</P>
<P>
In the entry hall, the initial display covers Nixon's ancestors, parents and 
life before he entered politics. Some highlights include evocative photos of 
Yorba Linda and Whittier in the early 20th Century and good coverage of his 
college days and early law practice. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the museum proper, visitors go through a movie theater where there is 
a continuous showing of a 25-minute film on Nixon's life. It is a piece of 
campaign puffery that will embarrass all but the most extreme Nixon supporters 
and infuriate his foes. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the theater, a wall display carries 30 of the 66 Time magazines 
with Nixon on the cover, easily the record. Then the museum moves on to Nixon's 
first campaign, in 1946 for Congress, against incumbent Jerry Voorhis. It is 
visually attractive and relatively fair; for example, the display does mention 
that Voorhis had been voted the "hardest-working" congressman in the House. It 
mentions, if only briefly, Nixon's red-baiting of Voorhis. What it does not do 
is provide an understanding at all of why it was that, starting with this 
campaign, so many people hated Nixon so much. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is a major shortcoming of the entire museum that nowhere is there 
any attempt to grapple with the problem of why Nixon, more so than any other 
politician of this century, elicited so much hatred. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the importance of the Alger Hiss spy case to Nixon's career, and 
the political courage he showed in pursuing Hiss after older Republicans 
advised him to back off, the Hiss display is disappointingly brief. 
</P>
<P>
It does contain a replica of the Woodstock typewriter that ultimately nailed 
Hiss, and it does have one of the State Department documents Hiss stole to give 
to the Soviets, but there is relatively little on Whitaker Chambers, who 
fingered Hiss. There is absolutely nothing on why an aristocrat like Hiss would 
find communism a compelling ideology, or on why Nixon, the kid from the wrong 
side of the tracks on the wrong coast of the country, would so resent this Ivy 
League intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
The 1950 campaign against Rep. Helen Gahagan Douglas for the U.S. Senate has 
three items of special interest: the first is the infamous "pink sheet" in 
which Nixon implied that Douglas was at best a communist sympathizer and at 
worst an active agent of the Communist Party. It was red-baiting at its lowest, 
according to Nixon's critics. 
</P>
<P>
The second is another handbill, put out by Douglas, in which she charged that 
it was Nixon who voted the Communist Party line. Her attempt to red-bait Nixon 
is something his critics have either ignored or long since forgotten. The third 
is a replica of the late 1940s station wagon in which Nixon toured the state 
and which was the real key to his landslide victory -- he just worked so hard. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of Nixon's 1952 vice presidential campaign is a long excerpt from 
his "Checkers" speech played on a small television set, in which Nixon 
successfully defended himself against charges he accepted money from a slush 
fund. This was the first major political event on television in American 
history, and the speech introduces a theme that dominates the remainder of the 
museum -- Nixon and TV. The "Checkers" speech was only separated from the 
Senate campaign by two years -- but what a difference. In 1950, he spoke to 
hundreds from the top of his station wagon; in 1952, to millions via TV. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's eight years as vice president are covered in a series of wonderful 
photographs. His foreign trips get the biggest play, with the emphasis on his 
1958 South American tour when he was stoned and spat upon, and his 1959 
"kitchen debate" with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev when Nixon told him he 
was guilty of enslaving millions. 
</P>
<P>
The vice presidential section also contains a document that will surprise many 
visitors, a long letter written in 1957 from Martin Luther King Jr. praising 
Nixon for his forthright advocacy of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
The central feature of the coverage of the 1960 campaign is a period living 
room with two sofas for visitors to sink into as they watch the Kennedy-Nixon 
debates on a small black-and-white TV. The footage is well-chosen; the 
commentary emphasizes that it was in the first debate that Nixon learned that 
style was more important than substance. Most viewers thought Kennedy won, 
because he looked so much better than Nixon on television; most voters who 
listened on the radio felt Nixon won. The museum does not claim that the 
election was stolen by the Democrats; it does stress the close vote. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon was, as former President Lyndon B. Johnson once observed, a chronic 
campaigner. The next campaign came in 1962, against Edmund G. (Pat) Brown for 
governor of California. The treatment is as bland as was the campaign. The only 
real excitement came the morning after Nixon lost the election when he held his 
"last press conference" and said reporters wouldn't have him to kick around 
anymore. Filmed footage of that press conference exists, but no part of it is 
shown in this museum. That is a mistake and a pity, as the news conference 
shows Nixon at his best and worst. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's "wilderness years," 1963-67, are skipped over quickly. There is no 
inkling of Nixon's role as the leading hawk on Vietnam, constantly criticizing 
Johnson for not escalating the war. Nixon called for more men and more bombs 
daily and loudly -- but not in this display. 
</P>
<P>
The following room, called "World Leaders," is absolutely stunning, 
extraordinary and all but overwhelming. By itself, it makes a visit to this 
museum worth a trip. The room consists of 10 life-size bronze statues of 
leaders Nixon dealt with in his long career, posed in relaxed postures, 
chatting with each other. 
</P>
<P>
The display on Nixon as president concentrates on the opening with China, with 
precious little mention of the fact that for 20 years, Nixon was the American 
politician most responsible for the isolation of China. Nixon's love affair 
with China and with Mao Tse-tung is evident everywhere, to the point where the 
surprisingly brief section on Nixon's relations with Soviet leader Leonid 
Brezhnev is contained within a Chinese pagoda. There is almost nothing on arms 
control or other aspects of Nixon's detente policy, a curious omission. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment of the Vietnam War is extremely one-sided. There is no agonizing, 
there are no doubts -- Nixon was right, the doves were criminally wrong. Almost 
all of Nixon's Nov. 3, 1969, "silent majority" speech is shown on a color 
television set. The commentary asserts that "this speech remains the milestone 
against which all other presidential addresses are judged." One wonders what 
happened to the Gettysburg Address. 
</P>
<P>
Barely mentioned are the 1970 Cambodian incursions and the Kent State tragedy 
in which National Guardsmen killed four students during a demonstration. The 
1971 invasion of Laos is not mentioned at all, the Christmas, 1972, bombing of 
Hanoi is downplayed and no attempt is made to explain why Nixon launched the 
bombing or what he got from it. 
</P>
<P>
The next room belongs to Pat Nixon, and it shows this truly great woman as she 
really is, heartwarming and wholesome, kind and considerate, loyal and 
hard-working. There are dozens of photos showing her from childhood to old age. 
Many presidential libraries feature a re-creation of the Oval Office. The Nixon 
Library re-creates the Lincoln Sitting Room. There is Nixon's stuffed chair, 
his ottoman, his pipe and his legal pad. A wall display contains many yellow 
sheets with Nixon's speech and book drafts scribbled on them. 
</P>
<P>
A single large room covers domestic affairs. The theme is "Nixon the 
innovator," which is a tough sell in some cases. The Environmental Protection 
Agency, for example, is offered as an illustration of Nixon as the far-seeing 
statesman without noting that he signed the bill creating the agency 
reluctantly and only after forcing the Democrats to soften the bill 
considerably. On energy conservation, the museum understates Nixon's 
farsightedness. He was urging Congress to reduce oil consumption and to 
increase domestic oil production six months before the 1973 Arab oil embargo 
caused the energy crisis. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one tiny display on Nixon's vice presidents, Spiro T. Agnew and 
Gerald R. Ford. There is not one mention of Ford's pardon of Nixon, an omission 
that is inexcusable. Also inexcusable is the absence of any reference to 
illegal surveillance or wiretapping activities against anti-Vietnam War 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
Watergate is covered in a single long, dark uninviting room with more written 
commentary than any other section. The presentation makes the best possible 
case for Nixon, mainly in Nixon's own words, and is entirely self-serving. 
There is one Watergate tape, complete with a headset, but it is far from 
complete and a commentator puts a spin on the tape that would almost convince a 
listener that Nixon never ordered a cover-up or a payment of hush money. 
</P>
<P>
Two things stand out about the Watergate treatment. First, it is impossible to 
make a solid case for Nixon, because he was guilty. The museum does the best it 
can with a hopeless case. Second, there is no attempt to assess the meaning of 
Watergate, or to describe what, if anything, was learned from the greatest 
political crisis of this century. 
</P>
<P>
But then it is not the purpose of museums to be retrospective, or to be 
critical, but rather it is to praise and honor. The Nixon Museum does this 
well. It allows the man it glorifies to speak in his own words, to make his own 
case. Nowhere is this better done than in the Presidential Forum room, the last 
in the tour. Visitors touch a computer display to ask Nixon a question -- there 
are about 800 listed -- and he comes on screen with the answer taped from past 
public appearances and a recently taped interview. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon is the most fascinating of all our 20th-Century politicians. His museum 
is almost as fascinating as the man himself, and frequently as contradictory, 
and often as contentious and always as partisan. It is a personal triumph for 
Nixon -- his supporters will love it, his critics will gnash their teeth -- and 
who could doubt but that this is just the way that Richard Nixon wants it?

BRENNAN CRAFTED A 34-YEAR LEGACY OF LEGAL LANDMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 34 years that William J. Brennan Jr. served on the nation's highest 
court, the United States underwent a profound social and political revolution, 
one which he, perhaps as much as any other person, helped shape. 
</P>
<P>
Under the relentless prodding of a diminutive, puckish, Harvard-educated, 
Irish-American lawyer from New Jersey, schools were desegregated, legislatures 
reapportioned, police procedures revolutionized, courts restructured and 
figures of authority across the land put on notice that their power could, and 
would, be called into question. 
</P>
<P>
"He had," said Stanford University law professor Gerald Gunther, "a great 
belief in the power of the judiciary to do good" coupled with the skills to 
turn those beliefs into law. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as the conservative National Review said of the liberal justice in a rueful 
1984 review of his work: "There is no individual in this country, on or off the 
court, who has had a more profound and sustained impact upon public policy in 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Even in the last years of his career, with nearly all his colleagues from the 
heyday of the activist court of the 1960s long since retired, Brennan continued 
to confound conservatives with his ability to muster majorities to support his 
liberal views. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, for example, William H. Rehnquist's first year as chief justice, it 
was Brennan, not Rehnquist, who held the majority on each one of the court's 
sharply divided major cases. 
</P>
<P>
Those cases included two upholding affirmative action, a subject of many of 
Brennan's most important decisions, a ruling protecting the rights of aliens 
seeking political asylum in the United States and a decision that extended 
federal anti-discrimination laws to cover people suffering from contagious 
diseases, including AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis F. Powell Jr.'s resignation and replacement by Anthony M. Kennedy later 
that year prevented Brennan from ever repeating that sort of wholesale victory 
again. But last year, he mustered five justices to support his decision that 
the First Amendment's protection of political expression shields even those who 
burn the flag. And last month, in what will now stand as the last of his more 
than 1,200 court opinions, Brennan stunned court watchers by rounding up a 
majority for a sweeping decision supporting federal affirmative action 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"His leaving the court closes a chapter in a very symbolic way," said A. E. 
Dick Howard of the University of Virginia law school. "As long as Brennan was 
on the court, the Warren Court had not concluded." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Brennan, himself, put it in a statement Friday night: "It is my hope that 
the court during my years of service has built a legacy of interpreting the 
Constitution and federal laws to make them responsive to the needs of the 
people whom they were intended to benefit and protect. 
</P>
<P>
"This legacy can and will withstand the test of time." 
</P>
<P>
That is an expectation shared, at least in part, by many constitutional 
scholars. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan's departure inevitably will accelerate the high court's turn to the 
right. Much as the court in the 1980s undid many of the liberal criminal-law 
decisions of the 1960s that Brennan helped write, the coming conservative court 
of the 1990s in all likelihood will trim back Brennan rulings on civil rights 
and the separation of church and state, experts suggest. 
</P>
<P>
But much of Brennan's judicial work -- particularly the basic principle that 
the Bill of Rights limits the actions not only of the federal government but of 
the states as well -- has become so firmly entrenched in American life and law 
that it is all but irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
"There are landmarks that will survive any conceivable majority," said Howard. 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, when Brennan joined the high court, the justices were still a sharply 
divided, often contentious group. Two years had passed since Brown vs. Board of 
Education ended legal school segregation in the United States and foreshadowed 
a new era of activism under Chief Justice Earl Warren. But the court Brennan 
joined was still a divided body with a substantial conservative contingent, led 
by Justice Felix Frankfurter, that resisted Warren's impulse to use judicial 
power to reshape other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
During those contentious days, Brennan was Warren's "closest ally," wrote 
Warren's biographer, Bernard Schwartz, in his book "Super Chief." It was 
Brennan who would find the legal formulas that could bring together a 
five-justice majority in support of Warren's positions. 
</P>
<P>
Steadily, and with ever greater success, Brennan convinced his colleagues to 
abandon Frankfurter's philosophy of placing sharp limits on judicial power. 
Then in 1961, in a Brennan decision that Warren, in his memoirs, called "the 
most important case of my tenure," the liberal wing of the court triumphed. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a century, voters living in cities across the country had been 
deprived of an equal voice in political decisions because rural legislative 
districts contained far fewer voters than districts in cities. Judges 
consistently had refused to hear claims that such unequal districts violated 
the Constitution. But in November, 1960, the high court agreed to consider the 
issue in a Tennessee case called Baker vs. Carr. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes were high. A ruling against the state would be a vast expansion of 
judicial power -- assertion of authority of judges into the realm of politics. 
But a ruling for the state would mean condemning urban voters in Tennessee and 
elsewhere to a permanent disenfranchisement. There was little possibility, 
after all, that the entrenched majorities in state legislatures would willingly 
vote themselves out of power. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz's account of the case, based on the papers of the former justices, 
illustrates the techniques that Brennan used throughout his career to develop 
his tremendous influence. 
</P>
<P>
The justices first heard arguments the following April. They deadlocked and 
decided to consider the case a second time in October, 1961. Immediately after 
the argument, Frankfurter, convinced that the Constitution provided absolutely 
no grounds for the court to involve itself in the case, sent the other justices 
a lengthy, highly detailed legal argument in favor of the state's position. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan, seeking to convince his colleagues of the unfairness they confronted, 
chose a different approach. Rather than a legal brief, he sent his colleagues a 
chart detailing how vastly the population of Tennessee's districts varied. The 
court faced a fundamental unfairness, he argued; it could not turn a blind eye. 
</P>
<P>
For months, debate over the case dominated the high court's closed-door 
conversations. Brennan carefully lobbied his colleagues, changing a word here, 
a paragraph there in his draft opinion to attract their votes. Slowly, the 
swing justices began to turn Brennan's way. Finally, on March 26, with a 
six-vote majority intact, Brennan announced the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Voters, he ruled, had the right to go to court to challenge legislative 
apportionment schemes. As Brennan's sonorous baritone read out the words of the 
decision across the justices' vast marble courtroom, Warren passed him a note: 
"It is a great day for the Irish," the chief justice had written at first. 
Then, crossing out the last word, he wrote: "It's a great day for the country." 
</P>
<P>
The Baker case made clear the fundamental theme of what would be known as the 
"Warren Court" -- that the justices were willing to venture outside old ideas 
of what the Constitution meant to remedy injustices. 
</P>
<P>
"We current justices read the Constitution in the only way that we can: as 20th 
Century Americans," Brennan said several years later in a speech at Georgetown 
Law School that he designed as a summary of his philosophy. "We look to the 
history of the time of framing (of the Constitution) and to the intervening 
history of interpretation. But the ultimate question must be: 'What do the 
words of the text mean in our time?' " 
</P>
<P>
To conservatives, that philosophy gave courts far too much power. Judges should 
be "strict constructionists" of the Constitution, they argued and should not 
create "new rights." 
</P>
<P>
Brennan rejected that argument. "The genius of the Constitution rests not in 
any static meaning it might have had in a world that is dead and gone, but in 
the adaptability of its great principles to cope with current problems and 
current needs," he said in his Georgetown speech. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven days after Baker vs. Carr, Frankfurter suffered a stroke and was forced 
to resign. President John F. Kennedy appointed Arthur J. Goldberg to replace 
him. The addition of one more solid liberal vote galvanized the Warren-Brennan 
majority. The next six years were among the most important in the history of 
the high court, a "breathtaking" series of major decisions said Howard of the 
University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those decisions were Brennan's. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, in a case called NAACP vs. Button, Brennan struck down a Virginia law 
that had prevented civil rights groups from filing suits to protect the rights 
of black citizens, a key victory for the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Brennan wrote the 1964 decision in New York Times vs. Sullivan 
which, for the first time, held that the First Amendment protected newspapers 
against libel suits by public officials. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, in a decision that directly touched the lives of millions, Brennan 
ruled that government bureaucrats could not deprive a person of benefits 
without following fair procedural rules. And the next year, Brennan ruled that 
federal officials who do violate an individual's rights can be sued for 
monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
But it was his criminal-law decisions that best showed Brennan's consistent 
concern for the least attractive members of society. The concern with the 
rights of criminals was baffling to Brennan's critics, who accused him of 
protecting the guilty at the expense of society. But to Brennan, the decisions 
were matters of fundamental fairness that ultimately protected all citizens 
from the power of the state.

Q &amp; A: BOBBY SHORT: GETTING A KICK OUT OF COLE PORTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You didn't have to live through the 1930s, '40s and '50s to recognize these 
tunes: "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," "I Love Paris," "Too Darn Hot," "Anything 
Goes," "I Get a Kick Out of You," "Night and Day." They are the witty, 
sophisticated and romantic handiwork of the beloved Cole Porter, who died in 
1964. A contemporary of the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz 
Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II, Porter is the subject of the "American Masters" 
documentary, "You're the Top: The Cole Porter Story," airing Monday at 10 p.m. 
on KCET. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour special features interviews with performers and artists who knew 
Porter-including Bob Hope, Gene Kelly, Cyd Charrisse, Alfred Drake-more than 20 
performances from his movie musicals and archival footage and photos. 
</P>
<P>
And who better to host and narrate the documentary than noted cabaret 
performer, Bobby Short, who talked about Porter and his legacy with Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever meet Cole Porter? 
</P>
<P>
I met him in the late 1940s. I had gone to the Masonic Hall in Los Angeles to 
accompany a young woman who was auditioning for the national company of "Kiss 
Me Kate." She sang for Mr. Porter, who was sitting out front in a very dapper 
up mood in spite of his physical disabilities (a horseback-riding accident in 
1937 left him handicapped) because he had this big hit on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
After she finished singing the song, he yelled out, "Bobby, what do you think 
of the show?" We never met formally; it was just like that. 
</P>
<P>
I think he had seen me before because I performed at the time on the Sunset 
Strip in a club called the Cafe Gala, which is now Spago. The Gala was about 
the most sophisticated little club on the West Coast. Porter was a regular. He 
could go there and hear his own songs. 
</P>
<P>
We became friends right there. I didn't see him again until I came to New York 
in the 1950s, where I saw him repeatedly at parties. He was a very polite 
person and, of course, I appeared in a revival of "Kiss Me Kate" in New York in 
1956. I played the role of Paul, who was the valet to the leading man, and I 
sang "Too Darn Hot." 
</P>
<P>
What makes Porter's songs so special? 
</P>
<P>
It was his lifestyle which made him so attractive. He had the most glamorous 
lifestyle. He had enough style, intelligence, integrity and education to make 
it all work. I think whatever you want in this life, if you want it badly 
enough, you can get it. I really think Porter wanted to live life at its 
highest level-socially, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Was composing easy for him? 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that Porter had great difficulty writing songs. When you 
write songs with an express purpose in mind, it is never easy. If you have to 
please a Hollywood studio executive with a song, it's not easy. 
</P>
<P>
The story about the song "Rosalie" that he wrote is just one example. I think 
he turned in a number of versions before the studio head said, "That's the one 
I want." When you are writing under a deadline for a Broadway show, it can't be 
easy. And if you are a perfectionist like Porter was, it can't be easy. It is 
not easy to please yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Which Porter songs do you enjoy performing? 
</P>
<P>
I like Cole Porter's ballads. I think he becomes very pensive in the ballads, 
and his love songs took on a new turn in popular songwriting. Porter made it 
quite plain that love is not always going to have a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever see the Porter film biography "Night and Day," which starred Cary 
Grant as the composer? 
</P>
<P>
I never saw the film. I think it was a commercialization of the many high 
points in his life. It had been said that Porter would have liked Fred Astaire 
to have portrayed him. He did have more of a resemblance to Porter than Cary 
Grant. 
</P>
<P>
I think the thing to remember is that Porter, despite his flirtation with high 
society and fancy living, was a very, very hard worker and came along at the 
time when it must have been difficult for a young man just out of Yale to break 
through the ranks of Tin Pan Alley in New York. 
</P>
<P>
What new insights into Porter does the documentary reveal? 
</P>
<P>
It goes quite deeply into his personal life. There is a lot of attention paid 
to the struggles he had after the accident, and the fact that he was indeed 
reclusive when the pain and the disability became too much. In the end, Porter 
lived by himself in the Waldorf Towers and saw only a few of his friends. I 
suppose that is the way most people who grow old and sick wind up. 
</P>
<P>
It always seems an artist's life is touched with sadness and tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
The entire pursuit of the arts necessarily makes for a kind of loneliness. If 
you are an artist, and I call myself one in a minor way, you are not really 
happy unless you are practicing your art. In the end, Cole Porter was not 
called upon to practice his art. His last effort was a TV special called 
"Aladdin" which was not particularly notable. I think all of our lives are 
mirrored in the lives of people as celebrated as Cole Porter. Think of all the 
people who end up all alone and ill who have not given the world anything or 
who are not special in anyway at all. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Porter's success, a lot of critics still don't take his songs 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the 1930s and all through Cole Porter's career, he has had to buck 
criticism. "Night and Day" came in for such criticism, I cannot tell you. 
People thought it sounded like Ravel's "Bolero" or some kind of a chant. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, he wrote a score for a show called "Jubilee" and it failed 
because the critics thought the songs were so terrible. Out of the show came 
"Begin the Beguine" and "Just One of Those Things." 
</P>
<P>
I think that Cole Porter's songs hold up very, very well. It's too bad people 
who tend to call themselves critics are so severe.
