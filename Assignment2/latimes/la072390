JACK SMITH: A ROSY GLIMPSE OF 2015 . . . FROM THE CLASS OF '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently I quoted here from letters written in 1940 and 1965 by the 
eighth-grade graduating classes of Malaga Cove Intermediate School, in Palos 
Verdes Estates. The letters were to be opened in 1960 and 1990; they described 
life on the peninsula as it was in those early years, and predicted what it 
might be like when the letters were opened. 
</P>
<P>
Carl L. Lane, principal of the school, writes that as a result of that notice 
the school was featured on national and local television and written about in 
local newspapers, and several schools (one as far away as New York) have 
established similar traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Lane, meanwhile, sends me a copy of the letter written by the class of 1990 to 
be opened in 2015. The most remarkable change on the peninsula since 1960, the 
letter notes, is the cost of housing. Prices range from $437,500 to $5.2 
million. The most expensive vacant lot is priced at $2,995,000. 
</P>
<P>
In reporting that the peninsula has 16 churches, the class sounds an ominous 
note. "Architecturally, the most well-known church is the Wayfarer's Chapel. We 
are concerned because it is located in a landslide area. We hope it is still in 
existence in 2015." 
</P>
<P>
One wonders what the class of 2015 will think about 1990's taste in music and 
dance. "We enjoy listening to heavy metal music, which is loud and fast guitar 
music. Rap music is also popular and consists of rhythm and blues with rhyming 
lyrics. . . . Most of the dances that are popular go along with rap music. The 
titles of these dances include the Cabbage Patch, Running Man, Roger Rabbit, 
and the Troop. Dancing that goes along with heavy metal and punk rock is Head 
Banging and Slamming." 
</P>
<P>
A glossary of slang in use by the class suggests that the 1990 students are not 
skilled in the art of gracious conversation. Positive words in favor are rad, 
gnarly, stoked and awesome. "Bail is used to tell someone to leave. We also 
refer to one another as stud, dude, nerd or loser." 
</P>
<P>
The letter reviews our times -- the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the 
reconciliation of East and West, the advances in medicine and communications, 
and the burgeoning of environmental concerns. Most of the students, the letter 
notes, have cable television service in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Then they look into the future. What will the peninsula, and the world, be like 
in 2015? No one can foresee the future, as our political pundits proved by 
failing to foresee the fall of the Berlin Wall. But it's fun to try. 
</P>
<P>
The class of 1990 predicts that in 2015 people won't bother to carry money. 
"Everything will be bought with a card." (About the only thing I need money for 
already is valet tips.) 
</P>
<P>
They predict that there will be no more empty lots in Palos Verdes Estates -- 
at any price. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a few people that will live on the moon for a very brief time, 
perhaps one or two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
OK. That's possible. But I wouldn't want to be among them, for reasons I shall 
explain. 
</P>
<P>
They say there will be cures for cancer, and AIDS and other sexually 
transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors will be able to cure memory loss and other diseases because they will 
understand the brain better." I can't wait. 
</P>
<P>
"People will think more of the environment and of other people. The world will 
be in an improved state." 
</P>
<P>
That's a pretty optimistic vision of the future. Of course, as some readers 
pointed out after reading the 1940 and 1965 reports, the children of Palos 
Verdes Estates enjoy a higher standard of living than those in many nearby 
communities, and perhaps have a rosier view of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
Before the world reaches that "improved state," we will not only have to 
eliminate AIDS and cancer; we will have to reduce population growth, eliminate 
enmity between states, adjust inequities between the races, find a way to clean 
the air and get rid of trash, save the forests, ease traffic congestion, reduce 
crime and improve education. 
</P>
<P>
With our cities generating millions of tons of trash daily and running out of 
places to put it, I predict that the moon will be used as a trash dump, and 
will soon become uninhabitable, except for an army of bulldozer operators. 
Then, when we have a full moon, we will not see the luminous disk of song and 
poetry; we will see the glint of billions of unrecycled cans, bottles and 
plastic containers. I predict that before this decade is over some entrepreneur 
will petition whomever the governing body might be for a permit to shoot trash 
to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
And Neil Armstrong's words -- "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap 
for mankind" -- will be a mockery. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, if the students of Malaga Cove have nothing better to do for 
recreation than Head Banging and Slamming, I predict that the Wayfarer's Chapel 
will indeed slide into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
But of course they can't all be nerds. I'll bet most of them are gnarly.

Forfeiture: Gov. Mario Cuomo was about to sign an asset-forfeiture bill along 
the East River in Manhattan when a young woman in a passing motorboat did some 
forfeiting of her own. As the boat passed the pier Thursday, the woman whipped 
off her bikini. Cuomo said of the New York City borough where he grew up: "This 
could never happen in Queens." 
</P>
<P>
Masquerading: The owners of London's famous Harrods department store have filed 
a $5-million lawsuit in Orlando, Fla., accusing a suspected thief of 
masquerading as a member of their wealthy family. The Al-Fayed family filed the 
suit against Mohamed Yehia Sead, claiming he has damaged the family name. The 
Al-Fayeds say by using the name of businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed, Sead got 
luxury service at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Atlanta and carried out other 
ruses. 
</P>
<P>
Cell Shocked: Jailed civil rights leader Al Sharpton is angry about being put 
in a cell recently vacated by one of the principals in the racially motivated 
killing of a black youth. Sharpton, sentenced to 15 days for a 1988 protest he 
led in New York City, was put in the Rikers Island maximum-security cell that 
once housed Joey Fama, who was convicted of the murder of Yusef Hawkins. 
Sharpton once led protests over the Hawkins slaying. A prison spokeswoman says 
no offense was intended. 
</P>
<P>
Intentions Test: A New York judge ruled that Donald Trump can be questioned by 
attorneys for his estranged wife, Ivana, about an alleged extramarital affair. 
Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob ruled late last week that 
Trump would have to divulge his intentions toward Marla Maples when he and his 
wife updated a prenuptial agreement in 1987. Mrs. Trump said she would not have 
signed the agreement -- giving her $25 million if she and Trump divorced -- had 
she known of his "adultery and philandering."

Question: Sometimes the people who write health articles assume the average 
reader knows more than he actually does. I've just finished an article about 
ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and I can't decide whether they are 
different names for the same disease or entirely different diseases. 
</P>
<P>
If they're different, in what way? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are separate disorders. 
Ulcerative colitis is a disease that is limited to the colon or large bowel. 
Crohn's disease may affect any part of the intestinal tract; however, it often 
involves the small bowel. You may occasionally hear Crohn's disease referred to 
as ileitis because the ileum (the end of the small intestine) is a common site 
of inflammation.

<P>
I'm black and I think Brown should be reminded that the dominant system in 
America is free enterprise -- not socialism. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, we are all, blacks and whites, at liberty to do virtually 
anything with our money. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it could be argued that if black stars such as Eddie Murphy, Michael 
Jackson and Bill Cosby had listened to Brown earlier in their careers, they 
probably would not be as wealthy and powerful as they are now. I don't think 
that they should feel obligated to spend their money in a way that fits Brown's 
idea of what is "meaningful."

INSPECTING TWO DEFENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It never fails to amaze me how righteously self-serving moviemakers and TV 
producers can get when they are criticized for making films that either pander 
to our basest morality or that perpetuate cultural stereotypes. Irvin Kershner 
and Henry G. Saperstein in the July 16 Counterpunch are the two latest 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
I'm glad to know that Kershner had only the noblest intentions in mind when he 
signed to direct "RoboCop 2." In fact, I greatly enjoyed his social analysis of 
his own movie. However, that is not the picture he made and that isn't why he 
made it. He seems to be ashamed to admit that he needed the job and now seeks 
to defend what he did by coating it with an after-the-fact veneer of thematic 
idealism. All I saw in "RoboCop 2" was an atrocious disregard for the value of 
human life. 
</P>
<P>
Saperstein's rationale for KCAL continuing to show those awful "Dick Tracy" 
cartoons from nearly 30 years ago has, in part, to do with their age. They are 
"only old cartoons," he says. Using that reasoning, let's bring on the Stepin 
Fetchit, Mantan Moreland and Richard Loo movies of the '30s and '40s; let's 
dust off the Bosco cartoon, and, hey, let's put "Birth of a Nation" on the 
Disney Channel. Yeah, they all featured ugly stereotypes, but they're only old 
movies, so "sit back and enjoy."

Brown tells us that African-Americans' will to survive in the entertainment 
industry "is molded in dependency and the need for white approval." I find it 
difficult to believe that Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy or any other 
African-American struggling to be part of the entertainment industry spend much 
time thinking about gaining white approval -- they're probably thinking about 
how to entertain and (hopefully) enlighten their audience and how to make the 
greatest amount of money doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's practice of hiring only "qualified black people" at Indigo Productions 
in 1983 sounds just as racist as a company hiring only Jews or Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with many of today's premier African-American stars is not that 
they haven't led the way to "black collective economic power," as Jim Brown 
would have us believe, but that they have been abusing their power and 
squandering their talent in the last few years by producing what is largely 
uninspiring, unfunny drivel. I am thinking primarily of Murphy ("The Golden 
Child," "Raw," "Another 48 HRS."); Pryor ("The Toy," "See No Evil"), and Cosby 
("Leonard Part 6," "Ghost Dad"). 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Jackson is not nearly as well-known these days for his artistry as 
for his success in selling his face and his songs to the highest corporate 
bidder.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE QUINCENTENNIAL;

<P>
1492 BROUGHT GENOCIDE; WHY CELEBRATE?; 
</P>
<P>
COLUMBUS' 'DISCOVERY' LAUNCHED A TERRIBLE CHAPTER IN HUMAN HISTORY, AND 
MILLIONS STILL SUFFER THE EFFECTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The 500th anniversary of Columbus' first voyage to America -- the 
Quincentennial -- is two years away, but the observances and the controversy 
have already begun. Earlier this month, the National Hispanic Quincentennial 
Commission held its first conference under the banner "500 Years of Pride." But 
other groups throughout the Americas plan a convocation in Ecuador to celebrate 
500 years of indigenous resistance. 
</P>
<P>
With such diametrically opposed interpretations, 1992 looms not as a period of 
healing and understanding but as a time of explosive conflict. 
</P>
<P>
For the indigenous and mestizo populations throughout the Americas, the year 
1492 marks one of the bloodiest chapters in the annals of human history. 
Particularly objectionable is the philosophical basis that makes possible the 
celebration of the Quincentennial -- what they call the "Black Legend." They 
see it as a rewriting of history, an Orwellian attempt to deny the genocide, 
the theft of land, the destruction of civilizations and the enslavement of the 
indigenous peoples of the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
The "Black Legend" serves the purpose of absolving Spain of guilt by claiming 
that its colonization was humane and its atrocities no worse than those of 
England and other European colonial powers. But relativity is not a defense. 
Besides, who killed fewer "Indians," or whose colonialism was more "civilized" 
is not the issue. The fact is that many millions of people in the Western 
Hemisphere were killed in the Spanish monarchy's pursuit of empire. 
</P>
<P>
Bartolome de las Casas, a Dominican friar who chronicled the brutality of the 
Spanish Conquest, estimated in 1540 that approximately 25 million indigenous 
people had been killed from the MesoAmerica and Caribbean areas less than 50 
years after Columbus' first voyage. His detractors to this day claim that De 
las Casas not only exaggerated, but that his work was promoted by the English 
as anti-Spanish propaganda. Some critics say that there were not that many 
indigenous people alive in all of the Americas; others, while ceding that many 
people perished, claim that the majority died of disease during the "encounter" 
with Europeans, not from brutality. 
</P>
<P>
Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, a Native American historian at Cal State Hayward, says 
that new evidence, based on agricultural studies, suggests that as many as 100 
million indigenous people were killed. She says that it was a case of genocide 
-- of scorched-earth policies, malnutrition, starvation and the resultant 
diseases -- not simply a result of European "contact." 
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo F. Acuna, a Chicano historian at Cal State Northridge, argues that the 
number doesn't matter. What he finds mind-boggling is the mere thought of 
celebrating genocide. 
</P>
<P>
During the period of colonization, the Catholic Church, on paper, came to 
accept the indigenous as human beings, but only after conversion. 
</P>
<P>
The church, which is participating in the Quincentennial, completely 
understands the meaning of the sword, and although repentant, it still seems to 
be unable to comprehend its role in the cultural genocide associated with its 
practices. To this day, Spain and the church have embedded in their psyches 
that they were sent by God to "civilize" the "savages" of the "New World" and 
save them from hell. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, that is what set Spain apart from other colonizers. In its efforts to 
"civilize," it enlisted the church; the church, in its efforts to "save the 
Indians' souls," corraled the indigenous population into missions, wiping out 
their identity, Christianizing them, and essentially attempting to culturally 
transform them into Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
The process taught the indigenous people to despise themselves. It taught them 
that Europe was the source of "civilization," and that all things European were 
good and all things non-European were bad. It also taught the indigenous 
people, and then the mestizo, the concept of European racial superiority and 
the notion of racial purity. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that the imposition of their beliefs upon entire peoples can somehow 
be construed as negative does not enter the realm of European consciousness. 
Neither does it bother Spain and its apologists that the genocide ushered in 
another of humanity's saddest chapters -- the introduction of African slavery 
into the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
The objection to the Quincentennial is for more than historical reasons: The 
legacies of colonialism and enslavement are painfully still with us today. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar-Ortiz is perplexed: "Why can't Spaniards, who suffered so much under the 
Franco dictatorship, not see that to celebrate is to glorify the onslaught of 
genocide and colonialism?" 
</P>
<P>
Spain need not celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's ambassador to the United States, Gustavo Petricioli, sees 1992 as 
marking a new era when the Americas will reach out and begin to share the 
richness of their peoples and cultures with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
And unlike Japan, which apologized to Korea this year for its 45-year 
occupation, or East Germany, which apologized this year to Jews worldwide for 
the Holocaust, Spain need not apologize. 
</P>
<P>
It should simply use the occasion to teach the truth, so that genocide and 
colonization may never be a part of human history again. 
</P>
<P>
Although historians disagree on the origins of the battle, it is regarded in 
Mexico as an unprovoked slaughter and the blackest mark against Cortes. It was 
a turning point against the Aztec leader Moctezuma, who had apparently planned 
to encircle Cortes and was stunned by the preemptive attack.

4,000 CASES, BUT WE SEE ONLY ONE; 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM BRENNAN: IT'S A PITY THAT THE DEBATE ON HIS SUCCESSOR WILL FOCUS ON 
ABORTION, SINCE THE COURT'S CONCERN IS THE WHOLE SWEEP OF THE CONSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD F. UELMEN, Gerald F. Uelmen is dean of the Santa Clara University 
School of Law and president of the California Academy of Appellate Lawyers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When William J. Brennan was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1956, the 
hottest issues before the court were the prosecution of communists under the 
Smith Act, the power of Congressional committees to investigate individuals, 
and the implementation of school desegregation orders. Through the 34 terms 
during which he sat, the parade of issues sweeping past the court touched every 
aspect of American life. He participated in more than 4,000 decisions, each 
eagerly awaited in order to settle a fiercely contested legal question. Many of 
the cases on the court's 1990 docket presented questions that couldn't even 
have been imagined in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the debate over Brennan's successor is likely to focus on only 
one of those 4,000 decisions. Brennan was one of four justices still on the 
court who are committed to Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that gave 
constitutional recognition to a woman's right to choose abortion. The fate of 
the decision hangs in the balance, with Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's 
most recent appointee, joining three others apparently ready to overrule Roe in 
the 1989 decision, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services. Justice Sandra Day 
O'Connor has been the so-called swing vote. 
</P>
<P>
The bruising contest over the nomination of Robert Bork was largely engendered 
by his clearly articulated rejection of the legitimacy of the constitutional 
right to privacy, the premise of Roe. That was a mistake that won't be 
repeated. Kennedy sailed through confirmation largely because his position on 
the abortion issue was a mystery, although his Roman Catholic religion gave 
anti-abortion forces some basis for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Any judge who has already staked out a position on abortion can abandon hope of 
nomination. Thus, the "litmus test" will not be a position on abortion, but the 
lack of a public position. Such a nominee can take refuge in the traditional 
refusal to comment on issues likely to come before the court. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of an articulated position for or against the right to abortion, and 
the refusal to take a position, will hardly remove the issue from the 
confirmation process. It will simply shift the debate to a process of 
inference. Both sides will strive to find some thread in a decision or personal 
predilection of the nominee on which they can hang a label. 
</P>
<P>
But this predictable exercise brushes aside the 3,999 or so other cases in 
which Brennan helped shape our law. Many of them are now accepted and familiar 
principles, making the controversy that greeted them startling to a modern 
observer. Baker vs. Carr established the principle of "one person, one vote"; 
New York Times vs. Sullivan gave the press protection against libel actions by 
public officials; Moore vs. East Cleveland protected the right of extended 
families to live together; and Katzenbach vs. Morgan struck down literacy tests 
that had disfranchised thousands of voters of Puerto Rican background. All of 
these were close decisions in which Brennan led the majority. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Brennan has issued pungent dissents to a shifting court's 
erosion of First and Fourth Amendment rights, access to the courts and civil 
rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
Single-issue politics makes no more sense in the selection of Supreme Court 
justices than it does in the selection of Presidents and legislators. The 
person nominated to fill Brennan's seat should be closely scrutinized. But the 
scrutiny should be as broad as the sweep of our Constitution. And the focus 
should be on the nominee's commitment to the basic values that the Constitution 
protects. Labels such as "liberal," "conservative," "pro-life" or "pro-choice" 
will not enlighten that process. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan endured lots of labels. I vividly recall his commencement address at 
Loyola Law School in Los Angeles five years ago, when he spoke with great 
dignity as an airplane circled above, pulling a banner that read, "Baby Killer 
Brennan." Such labels will soon be forgotten. The 4,000 decisions will live on 
in our law.

NON-SENATOR FOR A NON-STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS, Christopher Matthews writes a syndicated column in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Nov. 6, Jesse Jackson will be elected by voters here as a "shadow United 
States senator" for the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that Jesse Jackson is on the verge of becoming a real U.S. 
senator. For that, he would need to be elected by a state. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the "shadow senator" seat Jackson seeks here is designed not for 
lawmaking but lobbying. The only reason District of Columbia voters are being 
asked to choose two "shadow senators" and a "shadow congressman" this November 
is to give the district three high-level advocates for statehood. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson holds a much grander notion of the job, of course. He's made it clear 
that from the day he is elected he expects to be treated like a member of the 
United States Senate -- admission to the floor, membership in the Senate 
Democratic Caucus and the right to participate in public hearings. He has no 
intention of limiting his new job description to that of lobbyist for D.C. 
statehood. Just like any senator, he will want to speak out on any issue, 
domestic or foreign, that engages his or the nation's attention. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Jackson pull this off will tell us a great deal about the relative 
strengths of the old, coalition-built Democratic Party and the new media-built 
politics of racial polarization. 
</P>
<P>
Let's be clear on this. If the Democrats were a self-confident party in the 
1990's, if they knew who they were and were willing to act on it, the whole 
notion of the Senate Democratic leadership extending the trappings of 
membership to a lobbyist for the District of Columbia would be ludicrous. If 
Jesse Jackson were not both confident and fluent in the race-sensitive politics 
of the same 1990's he would not have the chutzpah to demand these things, not 
having earned them. 
</P>
<P>
Should Jackson succeed even partially with this exasperating "shadow senator" 
gambit, the spoils of victory will be great. Just seconds after we see or hear 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell treat him like a senator, we will 
probably hear Dan Rather start calling him by that title. The term "Sen. Jesse 
Jackson" will be part of the nation's boilerplate. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Jackson will not really have proved himself in public office. To win the 
credential he still needs for the Democratic presidential nomination, all 
Jackson has to do is to create the pretense of having won such a high-prestige 
position as U.S. Senator. In reality, he will be nothing more than a 
non-senator from a non-state. He will have the best of both worlds: a title 
without a job and a constituency without a record to defend.

PERFECT OPPORTUNITY FOR JUDGE KENYON; 
</P>
<P>
MAKE L. A. COUNTY GOVERNMENT FAIRER AND BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting today, U.S. Dist. Judge David V. Kenyon will preside over the final 
phase of the historic redistricting lawsuit lost by the self-preservationist 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon will be trying to end discrimination against Latinos -- and that's good 
-- but he could also lay the groundwork for a better system of government for 
all county residents. That would be even more helpful. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs in the case have already proved that the five white men on the 
county board violated the Voting Rights Act by discriminating against Latino 
voters when they redrew district lines in 1981. What begins today is the remedy 
phase of the case. The parties to the lawsuit must now present alternative 
district plans, and Kenyon has three maps under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, true to form, came up with a new plan that tries to preserve 
the status quo. The conservative majority ganged up on Supervisor Edmund D. 
Edelman and drew new lines that would put the liberal Edelman in a heavily 
Latino district. Black activists argue that it also puts so many new white 
voters in Kenneth Hahn's South Side district that it could be impossible for an 
African-American to get elected to the board. We can't see Kenyon being swayed 
by the supervisors' map, given the blatant disregard they've already shown for 
the rights of minority voters. 
</P>
<P>
The other maps before Kenyon have been submitted by the plaintiffs. They assume 
that Kenyon will opt for keeping the board at five members, and simply redraw 
district lines to improve the odds of a Latino being elected by combining the 
Latino barrios on Los Angeles' East Side with the increasingly Latino suburbs 
in the San Gabriel Valley. That's a safe legal strategy because there's already 
a possibility that a Latina, Sarah Flores, will be elected supervisor in that 
area in November's general election. But while Flores is widely regarded as the 
front-runner in that race, voters can do unexpected things. Nobody can assume 
that Flores' possible election makes the case against the county moot. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Voting Rights Act, a federal judge has considerable leeway in 
ordering a remedy to discrimination. He can even order changes in the size and 
structure of local government. That's what Kenyon should do here, because the 
problems with the board stem not just from discrimination, but from the fact 
that it's a decaying white elephant. 
</P>
<P>
With the county's population now exceeding 8 million people, there's no way a 
five-member board can govern responsively or very effectively. If anything, a 
system that gives five local politicians more power and money than many 
governors and most in Congress practically invites the abuse of power. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County needs a bigger board of supervisors -- seven or nine members 
-- and also an elected chief executive in order to have the checks and balances 
found in other systems of government. 
</P>
<P>
Like most federal judges, Kenyon is no radical. So he might understandably hold 
back from unilaterally ordering an expansion of the board. But he should at 
least consider giving residents a chance to vote on that option. Expansion 
plans have been defeated in past elections, but given the way folks from Acton 
to Malibu have lately been trying to wrest control of their communities from a 
board seen as arrogant and distant, the next election just might turn out 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon should at least give county voters a chance.

PRESIDENT'S SON AND BAILOUTS OF FAILED SAVINGS AND LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So now we're supposed to weep and moan with George and Barbara Bush as they 
agonize over the fate of their son Neil and his troubles with the Silverado 
Banking, Savings &amp; Loan ("Bush Discloses Anguish Over Son's Troubles," 
front page, July 12). What about weeping for the taxpayers who have to shell 
out $150 billion (or is up to $300 billion now? Or $600 billion? Or a 
trillion?) to bail out the savings and loan industry? 
</P>
<P>
What about those depositors who lost thousands and thousand of extra dollars 
when the Silverado investigation was postponed so it would fall after the 1988 
presidential election? 
</P>
<P>
Now we all know, of course, that George Bush was out of the loop on that 
decision, just as all know he was out of the loop on Iran-Contra, right? Want 
to know what's happening? Just read George's lips. And keep weeping for poor 
Neil.

SEARCHING FOR AMERICAN HEROES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David M. Kennedy's article "America Searches for Content in Heroes, in Values" 
(Opinion, July 8) echoed similar feelings in me. How is it we take our feelings 
for granted while foreigners tend to speak "with unabashed reverence about 
things like freedom and democracy?" They have "the discomforting habit of 
invoking our national icons and quoting our national heroes in defense of 
liberty." 
</P>
<P>
Is it so unsophisticated and simple-minded for us Americans to pay homage and 
worship our own native American heroes while we "lionize the visitors and not 
the locals"? 
</P>
<P>
If only the passionate crowds that greet our rock mega-stars and sports heroes 
would display such unabashed affection and enthusiasm for our own public heroes 
-- those who command and have earned our love and respect. 
</P>
<P>
Who are they? 
</P>
<P>
Men and women -- teachers, scientists, judges, senators, businessmen, painters, 
writers, etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
Let us name them while they are still alive. Let's not wait until our national 
symbols have become "marbled figures turned into tourist attractions."

GETTING THE ASBESTOS MESS UNDER CONTROL; 
</P>
<P>
THE SYSTEM IS BOGGED DOWN IN LITIGATION; JUSTICE HAS BEEN ALL TOO BLIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two federal judges recently moved to end one of the most expensive and 
waste-riddled legal free-for-alls in U.S. history. They want to consolidate the 
ongoing flood of litigation brought against asbestos manufacturers by 
individuals who have been exposed to the toxic fiber. The judges are calling 
for a comprehensive and innovative resolution to this bitter litigation, which 
has taken so long that thousands of victims literally die before their cases 
are heard. 
</P>
<P>
Any asbestos exposure can cause cancer, and long-term exposure can cause 
disabling or fatal pulmonary diseases. Although the oldest claimants were 
exposed to the insulating material while working under federal contract, the 
government has denied responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
A creative solution is needed because the number of claims is mushrooming -- at 
present, about 100,000 cases are pending nationwide. In Los Angeles alone, some 
5,000-8,000 cases have been closed since the 1970s, and a similar number are 
believed to be pending. Estimates of the cost of compensation surpass the GNPs 
of some Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the substantive legal issues have been decided, defendants continue 
to fight the claims. Manufacturers and insurers are also fighting each other 
over whose asbestos injured a given claimant. Amid this legal war of attrition, 
some defendants threaten or declare bankruptcy before all victims are 
compensated. 
</P>
<P>
Judges Jack Weinstein of New York and Thomas Lambros of Ohio want to stop this 
protracted litigation from siphoning off any more of the dwindling funds. The 
system has satisfied no one except the attorneys collecting lucrative fees. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Weinstein (who settled the massive Agent Orange case) took the first step 
toward clearing the growing thicket of briefs when he ordered restructuring of 
the nation's largest asbestos compensation trust so that there will be enough 
assets to pay all present and future asbestos victims. Judge Lambros took an 
equally bold step, establishing a national class- action suit, joining all 
present and future asbestos claimants. Both judges say that justice in this 
case has been so blind -- to waste and inefficiency -- that it is too often 
rendered posthumously or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
The tort system is failing asbestos victims. Either judge's plan may offer a 
path out of the tragic impasse. What is most important is to pay all claimants 
quickly and fairly, limit legal fees and establish health monitoring for 
asbestos victims. The right solution could set important precedents for other 
mass product-liability suits.

The responsibility for raising morally disciplined children now seems to fall 
entirely on the shoulders of artists, musicians, movie producers, cartoon 
producers, television producers, and writers of literary works, and not their 
busy, busy parents, right? 
</P>
<P>
The responsibility of deciding what I have the right to see, read and write has 
been oh so graciously "accepted" by narrow-minded, emotionally deficient 
right-wingers, correct? 
</P>
<P>
The responsibility of deciding what is legitimate and "acceptable" freedom of 
expression rests in the sacred hands of those who believe they have the right 
to live everyone's life, huh? 
</P>
<P>
But, the responsibility of saving the butts of corrupt presidential sons and 
other greedy, lying, hypocritical politicians is solely mine.

MORNING BRIEFING: BO WILL TRY TO HELP KIDS TO KNOW, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Come November, if there's still a preschooler in America who doesn't know Bo, 
Public Broadcasting Service will try to take care of that. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, while the Kansas City Royals were in New York to play the Yankees, 
Bo Jackson taped a segment for the PBS children's TV show, "Sesame Street." 
</P>
<P>
Kids watching the show will know, via Bo, the difference between up and down, 
empty and full and near and far, as well as the alphabet and counting skills. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which two states among the contiguous 48 don't have an NFL 
franchise and don't border on a state that does? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Bo knows: Michael Kay of the New York Daily News recently asked New York 
Yankee outfielder Deion Sanders if he privately knew what decision he would 
make between football and baseball. Said Sanders: "I know, but I really don't 
know. You know what I mean." 
</P>
<P>
Corn Belt backlash: The award for most graphic soccer bashing, post-World Cup, 
goes to Ed Anger, who writes a column called "My America" for "Weekly World 
News" in Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's edition of California Staatszeitung, a statewide German-language 
newspaper, reproduced one of Anger's columns, which led with, "I'm so happy 
that those stupid World Cup soccer matches are over I could kiss a pig on the 
mouth!" 
</P>
<P>
The German paper's headline-response: "News from the wild west . . . Who has a 
pig for Mr. Ed Anger?" 
</P>
<P>
Send resume: Jackie MacMullan of the Boston Globe recently scolded Dave Gavitt, 
the Boston Celtics' general manager, for considering Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski 
as a candidate for the Celtic coaching job. She called Krzyzewski's withdrawal 
"a blessing in disguise." 
</P>
<P>
MacMullan quoted Detroit Piston Coach Chuck Daly: "The preparation is endless. 
Our trainer, Mike Abdenour, knows more about the pro game than any college 
coach right now." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven pianos of granite: Former Michigan fullback Neil Snow, who scored the 
first touchdown in the first Rose Bowl game Jan. 1, 1902, is one of five 
players to be inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Snow, who died at 34 in 1914, was a member of Fielding (Hurry Up) Yost's 
Wolverines from 1901-04. Those teams were unbeaten and tied only once, 
outscoring their opponents 2,326-40. 
</P>
<P>
Said The Times: "Michigan's men formed a collection of superb specimens of 
all-around physical development -- calves like piano legs and arms to match -- 
all as hard as rocks." 
</P>
<P>
Calling an audible: Former University of Washington quarterback Sonny Sixkiller 
joined fellow native Americans, running a leg on the 1,000-mile, nine-day relay 
that delivered a carved, six-foot-long "talking stick" through the Northwest to 
Saturday night's Goodwill Games opening ceremonies at Husky Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sixkiller: "When you stand there holding it, people listen. You can't 
speak softly with this in your hand. We want the tribal kids to be proud of 
where they came from." 
</P>
<P>
Fiscal conservative: British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher Saturday attended 
the Newbury track in Berkshire, about 55 miles west of London. 
</P>
<P>
Whom did she like in the feature? 
</P>
<P>
Said Thatcher: "It is nearing the end of the Parliamentary session and I am 
here for sheer enjoyment -- there is no other motive."

The threat of severe thunderstorms at Cape Canaveral, Fla., forced another 
postponement of the launch of a newly repaired Atlas rocket with a government 
satellite aboard.

The first launch attempt, on Friday, was called off because of a helium leak, 
but the part that caused the problem has been replaced, officials said. The 
launch was rescheduled for 3:26 p.m. EDT today, but hopes were not high for a 
blastoff because the weather outlook appeared to be about the same. The Atlas 1 
rocket, making its commercial debut, was to boost the Combined Release and 
Radiation Effects Satellite into an elliptical orbit.

MASTERS NATIONAL CYCLING;

<P>
PRACTICE DIDN'T MAKE BROZNOWSKI PERFECT

Tom Broznowski lives two blocks away from the course used for the road races of 
the Masters National Cycling Championships Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Which makes most think that when Broznowski claimed the national title in the 
men's 30-34 89 kilometer race Sunday it's probably because he practices on the 
course often. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Broznowski avoids the course because of a 90-foot climb in one block 
which many refer to as the wall. 
</P>
<P>
On the fifth lap of the 17-lap race there was a break-away of three riders 
including eventual bronze medalist Steve Wood of Brentwood. The leaders held on 
for two laps before they were caught by a group of six riders. The pack then 
shifted and those eventually ending up in the top five, Thurlow Rogers (second, 
of Van Nuys), Evan Teske (fourth, of Rancho Santa Maria) and Steve Pyle (fifth, 
of Riverside, Conn.) plus Broznowski and Wood broke even further away from the 
pack. By the final lap the leaders had a three-minute lead on the field. 
Broznowski won the event in 2.14:33. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the field became discouraged," Rogers said. "We weren't really going 
that fast. I think the field expected us to let up but we never did." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, 30, didn't know he was racing in the event until Sunday morning. He had 
planned to attend the senior nationals but having been a professional until two 
years ago he was not allowed to compete in the seniors. So the morning of the 
race he petitioned to compete. Rogers had been prepared to do the 110-mile 
senior course which is double what the masters do so it wasn't surprising that 
once Rogers caught the pack he led until the final sprint. 
</P>
<P>
In the first three laps Broznowski broke a spoke as he climbed the hill. A 
Vita-Crunch teammate of his switched tires with him so he was able to continue 
immediately without losing much time. 
</P>
<P>
"My strategy all day was to save myself for the final sprint," Broznowski said. 
"I knew I couldn't go head to head with some of these guys but I knew from the 
track that I can sprint. I've traditionally been a road racer but I just 
haven't had that much time to put into it any more." 
</P>
<P>
In the women's 45+ 43 kilometer race three local riders placed in the top five. 
Barbara Rasmussen and Marty Rose both of San Diego and Elaine Steinway of 
Fallbrook placed second, third and fourth respectively. Camilla Buchanan of 
Williamsburg, Va. won the event, her fifth gold medal in five events. 
</P>
<P>
Steinway and her husband Clark both won two silver and two bronze medals during 
the week. Barbara won a bronze in the time trials and Clark won his silver in 
the men's 50+ pursuit and a bronze in the one kilometer. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about his races and I know he worries about mine," Barbara said. "He's 
very competitive so I'm really glad he's done so well." 
</P>
<P>
Two other local riders, Heather Odom and Tani Barbour, both of Vista, placed 
third and fourth respectively in the women's 30-34 63 kilometer race. Liz 
Heller of St. Louis won the race in 1.50:29.

TEAM MOSSIMO SKUNKS OTL TITLE 
</P>

When Team Mossimo took the court for its first game in the Old Mission Beach 
Athletic Club Over-The-Line World Championships, July 14, it's players might 
have felt skunked by the tournament's seeding committee. 
</P>
<P>
The team had three well-known men's open players, including Mike Poteet, a 
former world champion, but was left unseeded and thrown into the middle of the 
toughest bracket. But in the end it was Poteet, Rob Stillman and Trevor Shine 
-- Team Mossimo -- that were doing the skunking. 
</P>
<P>
The trio went 9-0 during the four-day tournament that started July 14, and won 
the 1990 title by not just beating but "skunking" a couple of OTL powerhouses 
Sunday. In OTL, skunk is the term used when one team leads another by 11 or 
more runs at the completion of an inning. Games last four innings, but a team 
can get skunked at any time. 
</P>
<P>
Team Mossimo reached the finals by skunking second-seeded Club Sportswear, 
16-5, in three innings, then routed Ryno Athletic Club, 12-1, for the 
championship. The game was called with one out in the bottom of the second, 
after Team Mossimo scored eight runs on eight consecutive hits. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody even expected us to be here on Sunday, but we knew what we could do," 
said Poteet, who helped Captain Morgan win the 1987 OMBAC title. 
</P>
<P>
Team Mossimo made believers of Ryno Athletic Club, which was bounced from the 
winners' bracket with a 21-19 loss to the eventual champs on Saturday, after 
Ryno hit six home runs in the first inning to lead 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
"They have talent in abundance," Ryno's Gary Romano said. "They're young and 
strong, they hit the ball hard and play defense. I would have picked them to be 
in the top-10." 
</P>
<P>
In the women's open final, third-seeded MGM Realty was forced to a second game 
before it beat top-seeded and defending champion Island Gecko Maui, 13-5. MGM, 
which came back from a 17-10 loss in the first finals game, found a winning 
combination with a virtual rookie and an old hand who has persevered through 
hard times. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Olow, a former softball player at Mt. Miguel High and Louisiana Tech, 
played in only her second OTL event, while Marilyn Medina continued her 
comeback from a disabling 1987 car accident. Medina was also being treated for 
skin cancer and had to wear long sleeves and cover her face with a special 
lotion that looked like orange war paint. Medina, Olow and Rose Teeple scored 
five runs in the top of the fourth to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
"I just picked the game up real quickly and I'm used to the pressure," said 
Olow, whose Lousiana Tech team reached the College World Series in 1985. "I got 
a ring, which is something I didn't get in college."

GROSS GETS TRICKY TO WIN RACQUETBALL FINAL OVER ANDREWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL WALKER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Gross completed on Sunday what he began the day before, weaving magic on a 
20 X 40 court by using his racquet as a wand. 
</P>
<P>
Gross, 22, who amuses youngsters and stays loose himself by performing a 
sleight-of-hand routine between matches, completed a sweep through the open 
division of the Summer Shootout racquetball finals at Sequoia Club/Racquetball 
World in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Gross routed Ed Andrews in the championship match, 15-10, 15-4, taking home 
first prize of $500. Andrews won $250. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews, seeded No. 2, appeared to run out of gas in the second game as the 
quicker Gross frequently passed him with unreturnable shots. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Gross, from Sherman Oaks, won without having to play a 
tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Gross defeated Dave Genevae of Yorba Linda, 15-2, 15-5, in a semifinal match 
played earlier in the day while Andrews, from Huntington Beach, reached the 
finals by taking out No. 3-seeded Mark Silva of West Hills, 15-7, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
Gross later teamed with Andrews to defeat Chad Solter of Chatsworth and Kevin 
Tisinger of Moorpark for the doubles championship, 15-4, 15-8. BILL WALKER

WEST KEEPS DISTRICT 20 TITLE, 4-3; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN LEGION: AFTER A SHAKY START, RELIEVER SEAN BOLDT HOLDS OFF PANORAMA 
CITY IN CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 
</P>

<P>
For eight innings Sunday, Panorama City batters got a panoramic view of Pat 
Treend's pitching dominance in the American Legion District 20 baseball 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
But in the ninth, Treend watched helplessly from the Woodland Hills West dugout 
as Panorama City batters mercilessly ripped reliever Sean Boldt, turning 
Treend's three-hit shutout into an historic footnote. 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City parlayed five ninth-inning singles into three runs and had the 
potential tying run at first base before Boldt and Woodland Hills West closed 
the door to win its second consecutive District 20 title, 4-3, at Birmingham 
High. 
</P>
<P>
The win moves West, the defending national champions, into the Area 6 playoffs 
beginning Thursday and continuing through Sunday at UCLA's Jackie Robinson 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
West Coach Don Hornback pulled Treend (4-2) from the game after the eighth 
inning because he said the right-hander was feeling some tenderness in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't getting soar so much," said Treend, who struck out five, walked four 
and hit a batter. "I was just getting lazy and pitched in a different arm 
location each time. If I started short-arming it, (my arm) gets tight." 
</P>
<P>
Boldt was tight, too. The right-hander checked in at the mound in the ninth 
with little warm-up time and that might have affected his breaking pitches, 
according to catcher Bobby Kim. 
</P>
<P>
"If Sean threw in the bullpen a little bit, he'd have been much better," Kim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A controversial interference call in the ninth inning helped Boldt, however. 
</P>
<P>
With no one out, Shad Ortiz, who singled to score Panorama City's third run in 
the inning, slid into second baseman Paul Geller in an attempt to break-up a 
potential double play after Bobby Kite grounded to Boldt. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz was out on the play, but he knocked Geller off balance before Geller 
could throw to Roland De La Maza at first. The second base umpire, who claimed 
Ortiz slid out of the base line, called interference on the play and ruled Kite 
out at first. 
</P>
<P>
"I slid straight at the bag," Ortiz said. "I was just trying to break-up the 
double play." 
</P>
<P>
After surrendering another single to John Langley, Boldt struck out David 
Garcia on a 1-2 pitch to thwart Panorama City's late surge. 
</P>
<P>
West (23-4) took a quick 2-0 lead in the second after Jason Cohen led off with 
a single and Kim followed with his first of two doubles. Designated-hitter Greg 
Lederman singled home Cohen and Kim scored when Greg Sheren hit into a double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
In his next at-bat Sheren popped Russell Ortiz's 1-0 pitch over the 
left-center-field fence for a 3-0 West advantage in the fifth. Sheren scored 
again in the seventh on Geller's fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz (4-2) struck out six in going the distance for Panorama City (22-7), last 
year's District 20 and Area 6 runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City, which advanced to the Area 6 playoffs as the district's 
second-place team last year, will not play again this summer because District 
20 is limited to one berth in the regional playoffs.

Teshigahara Tribute Hits Snag: The L.A. Festival may have run into snags for 
its scheduled Sept. 3 and 4 screenings of Hiroshi Teshigahara's new film, 
"Rikyu," which has been billed as the director's "triumphant return to 
filmmaking" after an absence of 17 years. An L.A. Festival spokesman said that 
the Japanese director -- who achieved international renown 25 years ago with 
"Woman in the Dunes" -- told the festival late last week that he no longer has 
rights to "Rikyu," which tells the story of a legendary 16th-Century tea master 
and his complex relationship with his warlord patron. 
</P>
<P>
But the arts festival is now "trying to work out a deal with the New York 
distribution company holding the rights -- it's not a dead issue," the 
spokesman said. Even if the film is screened as scheduled, however, the 
director said that he will not be attending the festival because of other 
commitments. GREG BRAXTON

Geraldo 'Vice' Suit Settled: Attorneys say they have settled out of court a 
$30-million lawsuit filed against Geraldo Rivera by a woman who was arrested 
during a drug raid carried live on national television. Terry Rouse, 32, of 
Houston, Tex., filed the libel suit against Rivera in 1987 stemming from the 
Dec. 2, 1986, telecast of "American Vice: The Doping of a Nation." The 
settlement, involving an undisclosed amount of money, came after Rivera was 
questioned for six hours while giving a deposition Thursday. GREG BRAXTON

MANCHESTER CRAZE HITS CRITICAL MASS AT THE PALLADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this country, the craze for Manchester's current Summer of Love is still 
kind of theoretical. You're more likely to read an article about a Manchester 
band than hear one on the radio; more likely to know about the fashion -- 
bell-bottoms! -- than about the sound. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Manchester house-music extravaganzas have been popping up in Los Angeles 
with some regularity in the last few weeks, both home-grown and imported, and 
with the packed Happy Mondays show at the Hollywood Palladium Friday, the 
phenomenon may have achieved critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
You entered through a lobby rigged with elaborate strobes, a bubble machine and 
a banner reading "The United States of Manchester"; you fought your way through 
a crowd of kids wearing souvenir T-shirts from last month's Manchester shows 
here. 
</P>
<P>
On stage around midnight (these bands follow club hours, not concert hours), 
the Manchester house sensation called A Guy Called Gerald -- one of the two 
opening acts -- stood behind a bank of electronic equipment, bobbing his 
shoulders, occasionally tweaking a knob, pushing buttons. 
</P>
<P>
Or was that a guy named Gerald standing next to him, bending back and forth, 
playing glockenspiel-like keyboard lines? (Primarily a studio kind of guy, 
Gerald likes to cultivate anonymity.) 
</P>
<P>
A busty woman in the tightest possible mini-dress wailed counterpoint in the 
genre-approved Third-World-ecstatic style, and the result was bloodless, 
standard-issue house music, raw. 
</P>
<P>
On a screen behind the dance floor, op-art patterns shimmered, stick figures 
danced, and a happy face, the symbol of druggy British house music, appeared, 
surrounded by pulsing concentric circles. "Love Love Love" and "Acid Acid Acid" 
flashed onto the screen. 
</P>
<P>
If you'd looked away from the stage at one point, you might have noticed the 
beat getting a little stronger, the musical samples more interesting, the 
people on the crowded dance floor actually dancing. This, of course, meant that 
Gerald and friends had finished their set, and one of the deejays imported from 
Manchester's Hacienda club had slipped on a record . . . without missing a 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
Happy Mondays is possibly the band most associated with the Manchester scene 
(Stone Roses is more a band than a Manchester band at this point) -- as proud 
of its members' drug-dealer pasts as it is of its No. 1 singles. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Shaun Ryder stands stock-still as a Talking Head. He croons in a flat, 
Jim Morrison baritone and hides behind a light-filled smoke screen like that 
other enigmatic Manchester front man, the Fall's Mark E. Smith. Bez, who 
doesn't actually sing or play an instrument, lopes in place like a man trying 
to run underwater, commanding the stage, acting sort of as the Flavor Flav of 
Public Enemy to Ryder's Chuck D. 
</P>
<P>
Happy Mondays manages to be one of the few bands anywhere that manages to sound 
simultaneously powerful and cheesy. Its big builds and edgy sonorities Friday 
were sometimes more than a little reminiscent of primo Doors -- and nearly as 
hypnotic, as shrieking and as self-consciously dull. 
</P>
<P>
They're the first of the recent live Manchester arrivals worth listening to -- 
bring on the Stone Roses! -- and their aggressive, danceable psychedelia may 
have what it takes to evolve into a solid, second-tier rock presence. 
</P>

THREE-RING CIRCUS FROM SOUL II SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The glib hipster Jazzie B -- producer, composer, arranger and rapper for the 
black English group Soul II Soul, as well as its leader and guru -- was more 
like a ringmaster on Friday, presiding over a three-ring musical circus at the 
Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
The stage was often so packed with musicians and dancers that you didn't know 
who or what to focus on: strings, a three-man horn unit and a blaring, 
startlingly precise rhythm section accompanied a quartet of backup singers who 
in turn supported four female lead singers and the occasional chanting and 
chattering of Jazzie B. 
</P>
<P>
Soul II Soul played funky dance music in that chaotic, cluttered stage 
environment, highlighted by colorful backdrops, clouds of smoke and flashing 
lights -- a lively re-creation of the audio-visual assaults that characterized 
'70s discos. 
</P>
<P>
To put the audience in the mood for what was to come, the show opened with a 
simulated dance-club segment and fashion show, with dancers/models strutting to 
taped music. 
</P>
<P>
For those who like loping dance music -- as most of the crowd that nearly 
filled the theater presumably did -- Soul II Soul's show was pure ecstasy, a 
hip-shaking, toe-tapping feast. 
</P>
<P>
The rhythm section laid down such a strong, relentless beat that it was often 
difficult to pay attention to the melodies and the vocals. There was enough 
variety in this music to counter the common claim that dance music is shallow 
and repetitive. 
</P>
<P>
Soul II Soul's music is an ingeniously danceable mix of assorted elements, such 
as James Brown-style funk, the orchestral disco sound of Barry White, 
mainstream jazz and the R&amp;B vocal style popularized by Motown in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
When the group's first album, "Keep on Movin'," came out last year, featuring 
singles such as the title song and "Back to Life," it was dazzlingly different 
-- like nothing else on the market at the time. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter that at times Jazzie B was on his soap box, spewing out 
fortune-cookie philosophy. You simply tuned in the great grooves and tuned out 
such mutterings as "A happy face, a thumping bass, for a loving race." 
</P>
<P>
Jazzie B is a likeable eccentric who walks with a cane, wears shades and has 
his dreadlocks done up in a rooster-like do. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he was occasionally rapping and philosophizing, preaching 
positivism, love, determination and dedication. He seemed to be trying to 
enshroud the music with the mantle of nobility and importance -- trying to make 
it seem like more than it really is. But audience didn't seem to let his 
prattle get in the way of savoring those scintillating grooves. 
</P>
<P>
As good as most of the show was, Soul II Soul isn't progressing. The material 
on Soul II Soul's second album, "1990 -- a New Decade" -- is a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Jazzie B and company seemed fresh out of fresh ideas. They recycled some of the 
best parts of the first album, but did a lousy job of disguising the rehashed 
material. Also, none of the lead singers seemed to be in a league with Caron 
Wheeler, whose exceptionally soulful vocals were among the highlights of the 
first album. Wheeler, who's gone solo, is absent from the new album -- and 
sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
Though singers like Victoria Wilson-James and Marcia Lewis don't shine on that 
second album, in concert all verged on outstanding -- giving the kind of 
dynamic, powerful vocal performances that would have given the album a badly 
needed boost.

JAZZ PUTS IN STAKES AT LEGENDS OF HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Every time a jazz club folds, two others open up. The latest addition is 
Legends of Hollywood, a deli and steakhouse on Hollywood Boulevard, where 
straight-ahead sounds are now heard three nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Migliori, best known for his long dues-paying with Supersax, is the regular 
Friday incumbent. With him are Stu Pearlman on electric keyboard, Larry Steen 
on upright bass and, as drummer and vocalist, Bob Marks, who owns the club and 
launched the jazz policy last month. 
</P>
<P>
Given a rare chance to stretch out here, Migliori displays a strong be-bop 
orientation in his solos, bringing undulant life to such vintage works as 
"Billie's Bounce." 
</P>
<P>
It was when he switched from tenor to soprano sax during this tune that his 
sound, phrasing and ideas best reflected his long years of creative input. The 
thought came to mind that Migliori was offering a slight idea of how Charlie 
Parker, who wrote this blues line, might have sounded had he played soprano (an 
instrument virtually unused in the jazz of his day). 
</P>
<P>
Pearlman, who plays a Yamaha keyboard standing up, had to grapple with the 
instrument's lack of a true bass function; in a long and otherwise satisfactory 
solo on "Just Friends," he hardly used the left hand except for occasional 
punctuations. 
</P>
<P>
Steen is a young, limber bassist whose works sparkled with fresh ideas. Marks, 
who was away from jazz drumming for years playing the Vegas circuit, has 
successfully made the transition back. His underlining of the accents in two 
bossa novas was brisk and propulsive. As a singer he ought to stay away from 
molasses-tempo ballads. His attempt to combine "Weaver of Dreams" and "There 
Will Never Be Another You" didn't merely lose the audience, it never found them 
-- they just yakked their way through it. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Pizzi takes the stand Saturdays at Legends of Hollywood: Sundays are given 
over to jam sessions. The sound in the high-ceilinged, 107-capacity room is 
adequate, and the lack of air-conditioning is compensated for by eight large 
overhead fans. More fans -- the human type -- can be expected if Marks moves 
toward what he says may soon be a five-nights-a-week policy. LEONARD FEATHER

DOWN-HOME, FAR-OUT SUNSET JUNCTION STREET FAIR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a city not exactly known for tight-knit neighborhoods, Silver Lake stands 
out for its semblance of community. So it was no surprise that the 10th annual 
Sunset Junction Street Fair held there this weekend had the feel of an 
old-fashioned, small-town festival: two-bit carnival rides, corn on the cob, 
local merchants and artisans hawking their wares, and local musicians 
entertaining the leisurely strollers. 
</P>
<P>
This is Silver Lake, though, so the event had its own distinct, new-fashioned 
character. Instead of a cake walk there were sign-ups for the AIDS Walk; among 
the wares on display were crystals and handcuffs; and among the musicians were 
the earthy-rock likes of Dave Alvin and John Doe. 
</P>
<P>
But even the lesser-known musical acts served to reflect more than adequately 
the culturally diverse community. At one point on a hot Saturday afternoon one 
of two music stages hosted a Janis Joplin imitator (whose thrift-store fashions 
mirrored the recycled clothing being offered at several stores within spitting 
distance), while at the other end of the four-block fair Arco Iris played what 
could be described as Latin-tinged crystal music. 
</P>
<P>
Later "Janis" was succeeded by the Mustangs, a spirited all-female country-rock 
group, while Arco Iris was followed by the Blue Shadows, a rocking blues group 
that has gained a following as the house band at Hollywood's King King club. 
All that was missing was the livestock competition. STEVE HOCHMAN

COURT QUEST COULD START 'BLOOD BATH,' DOLE SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: HE WARNS THAT AN ABORTION 'LITMUS TEST' WOULD IGNITE A FIGHT DURING 
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush met for an hour and a half with top advisers Sunday night as 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) warned that the nomination of a 
hard-line anti-abortion candidate for the Supreme Court could create a "blood 
bath" in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Amid signs that the nomination process is on a fast track, Bush called Vice 
President Dan Quayle, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, White House Counsel C. Boyden 
Gray and Chief of Staff John H. Sununu to the White House for their second 
meeting of the weekend to discuss a replacement for retired Supreme Court 
Justice William J. Brennan Jr. 
</P>
<P>
A new nominee "could come as early as this week," White House spokesman Alixe 
Glenn said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Dole, a conservative and an opponent of abortion, said on the NBC-TV program 
"Meet the Press," that President Bush faces "the toughest domestic decision he 
has had to make since he's been President" and advised that Bush should not 
feel beholden to any one group -- such as the conservative wing of the GOP -- 
in making his choice. 
</P>
<P>
Bush held his meeting Sunday night to guarantee a lengthy free period on his 
schedule to "discuss candidates and qualifications," Glenn said. The meeting 
originally had been scheduled to take half an hour, but went three times as 
long. 
</P>
<P>
Two key members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sens. Orrin G. Hatch 
(R-Utah) and Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), said that they do not expect any 
contact with the White House until today. 
</P>
<P>
Dole said Sunday that Bush called him the previous night "to ask if I had any 
ideas." Dole said he warned the President that "I assumed the big A word would 
be the tough hurdle to climb." 
</P>
<P>
Dole said he did not believe that former President Ronald Reagan had asked any 
of his three court nominees their views on abortion during the selection 
process, "so I don't think the President or anybody's going to ask on his 
behalf." 
</P>
<P>
However, activists on both sides of the abortion issue said that they consider 
the eventual nominee's view on abortion to be critical and are unlikely to be 
satisfied with a nominee who declines to express his or her view on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Dole suggested, however, that the President's choice will fare better in 
confirmation hearings if he or she is chosen for a broad array of talents. 
</P>
<P>
"What President Bush owes the country -- that's the important thing, not any 
group, liberals or conservatives, or pro-life or pro-choice -- is an 
outstanding nominee who will be on the bench for some time, someone young 
enough to be there 10, 15 or 20 years," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
Dole, who called himself "a pro-life senator," predicted that if Bush selects 
"someone who wants to overturn Roe vs. Wade, it's going to be a blood bath 
getting the nomination confirmed, and the same is true on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the Judiciary Committee, which will conduct hearings on the 
nomination, agreed that Bush should avoid making the decision based on a 
candidate's position on one issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope President Bush does not go for a single-issue litmus test," said Sen. 
Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), appearing on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
The nominee should "have a broad base -- learned in the law, background, 
experience, integrity," Specter said. "The abortion issue is only one of many, 
many very important issues to come before the court, and I do not believe a 
Supreme Court justice . . . ought to be evaluated solely on where he or she 
stands on a single issue." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), another member of the committee, described the 
situation facing President Bush as "an enormous opportunity" and said that, if 
asked, he would advise the President: "Don't . . . go with the symbolism. . . . 
Some will ask you to make a symbolic appointment. Go with your place in the 
history books because, what you do in this appointment, you can shape the 
course of the Supreme Court well into the next century." 
</P>
<P>
Leahy said that the Judiciary Committee will give the nominee "a fair hearing," 
and said that "we ought to give the President, at least initially, the benefit 
of the doubt. I would hope that he would go with this great historic 
opportunity he has and think of all the country, but also think of the time, 
the decades beyond. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), another member of the committee, said on 
ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley" that he does not think there is "any 
chance he (Bush) will appoint or nominate somebody that I would like. On the 
other hand, I think that there is a chance he'll send somebody up who I would 
consider a balanced nominee." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I think the Senate Judiciary Committee is not looking for a battle. 
I think we're hopeful that George Bush, the President, will nominate somebody 
that represents some balance, not somebody that we're all going to be enthused 
about, but somebody that is not just a candidate of the right wing." 
</P>
<P>
Names that have emerged during the weekend include U.S. Solicitor Gen. Kenneth 
W. Starr, 44, who served five years on the federal appeals court here and is 
considered a leading candidate; appeals court judges David Souter, 50, a Bush 
appointee to the court in Boston; Ralph K. Winter, 54, of New Haven, Conn.; 
Edith Jones, 41, of Houston; and Patrick Higginbotham, 51, of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing on the ABC program, Hatch said that he still regrets the defeat 
of Robert H. Bork, Reagan's failed choice for the court, and hopes President 
Bush will consider him -- a prospect many observers doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the great tragedies of the Senate confirmation process was the 
defeat of Robert Bork," Hatch said. "There's no question . . . that he deserved 
to be on the court, and I don't think there's much question in anybody else's 
mind, including the people out there in the country." 
</P>
<P>
But Metzenbaum said that nominating Bork again would "just open up the whole 
gamut of issues that we had before," adding: "I don't think there's any more 
likelihood that Robert Bork would be confirmed this time than there was last 
time."

I'm not a politician, and my other habits are good also. -- Artemus Ward 
19th-Century American humorist 
</P>
<P>
The punishment of wise men who refuse to take part in the affairs of government 
is to live under the government of unwise men. -- Plato 
</P>
<P>
Campaign Manager Jack Flanigan woke up staring at the ceiling. "It hit me like 
a lightning bolt," he recalls. "I was saying to myself, 'This is really a very 
difficult lifestyle. I'm not sure I want to do this the rest of my life.' " 
</P>
<P>
At the state Capitol, Mike Gage felt "worn down" as an assemblyman and was 
tired of all "the public shake-and-howdy routine," he remembers. "So I gave up 
my (legislative) seat and went off and led white-water rafting expeditions 
around the world -- India, Pakistan, Chile, Peru, Zimbabwe, Zambia. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Lisa Specht ran once for office and lost and was starting to 
run again when somebody pulled the rug out from under her politically. Now, 
she'll probably never run again, she says. "I was ready then, really focused on 
politics. Now I'm focused on having a well-rounded life. Timing is everything." 
</P>
<P>
These are three examples of Californians -- possibly potential political 
leaders -- who have forsaken elective office for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Who needs it?" is the common cry -- who needs begging for campaign donations, 
seeing one's private life exposed in the news media, having one's reputation 
sullied by an opponent's cheap-shot attacks, giving up any semblance of normal 
family life, taking a pay cut to step off the corporate career ladder and 
winding up a likely loser on election night? 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is a clear need for more political leaders with vision and 
courage to guide the nation's most diverse and populous state. California's 
infrastructure -- water, transportation, education, waste facilities -- is not 
keeping pace with its population boom. The consumer-driven, growth-oriented 
society is losing its battle against pollution. The Legislature for the fourth 
straight year failed to meet its No. 1 responsibility of passing a state budget 
in time for the new fiscal year, frustrating and confusing local governments, 
private contractors and dependent citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Also, representative government has deteriorated to the point where virtually 
any major state action seems to require a vote of the people on a ballot 
measure. And symbolic of the politics of avoidance -- the ignoring of complex, 
tough problems in favor of hot-button, crowd-pleasing rhetoric -- one of the 
chief "issues" in the gubernatorial race has been the death penalty, in truth a 
non-issue that was settled years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It is not certain that either Flanigan, Gage or Specht would be making a 
difference even if they were holding elective office. What is certain is that 
they, in a lot of ways, symbolize countless thousands of Californians with a 
natural bent toward public affairs who have opted out of running for office. As 
with these three, many are political junkies who may play key campaign roles 
behind the scenes, but have decided not to test their leadership potentials by 
entering the often-shallow, mean-spirited public arena that candidates must 
endure to achieve power. 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan had been managing Republican Pete Wilson's reelection campaign for San 
Diego mayor and charting his own political career 15 years ago when he "got the 
cure," as he put it. "Until then, practically every waking moment of my entire 
existence from the time I was 10 years old had been spent preparing myself to 
run for office." Now he is an Irvine Co. vice president, running the 
development firm's vast lobbying activities while, in his spare time, helping 
to raise money for U.S. Sen. Wilson's gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
Former Democratic Assemblyman Gage never has gotten the bug to run again 
himself. But he did get lured back into politics for a stormy stint as Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's chief deputy. "It was one of the highest and lowest 
times of my life," he says. Recently, Gage has become Bradley's point man on 
the Water and Power Commission, shepherding the mayor's efforts to redirect the 
DWP more toward environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Specht was outmaneuvered running for Los Angeles city attorney when 
three opponents dropped out of a crowded field at the last minute and endorsed 
her main rival, ultimate winner James K. Hahn. Later, she withdrew early from a 
race for City Council because the incumbent, Zev Yaroslavsky, unexpectedly 
decided to run for reelection instead of for mayor. Specht insists she wasn't 
embittered by these experiences -- "All's fair in war, and politics is war." 
But she no longer hungers for elective office. She recently rejoined a Westside 
law firm headed by former Democratic National Committee Chairman Charles T. 
Manatt. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't more good people run for office in California? The Times posed that 
question to political consultants and activists, former government officials 
and current officeholders, private executives and academicians and got a 
variety of responses. 
</P>
<P>
People detest asking friends and special interests for money to finance 
increasingly costly campaigns, they said. They also object to living in a 
fishbowl of public scrutiny. They abhor the character assassinations, TV "sound 
bite" campaigning and trivializing of issues. They know that because of the 
gerrymandered drawing of legislative districts the odds of a challenger beating 
an incumbent are slim to none. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they should win, some said, the pay and hours and prestige are lousy. 
Besides, they observed, there is little hope of really accomplishing anything, 
of making a substantive difference -- if you're a Democrat, it's because the 
GOP refuses to raise taxes for needed programs; if you're a Republican, it's 
because Democrats solidly control the legislative process; if you're a member 
of either party, it's because proliferating ballot measures have straitjacketed 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
And there is perhaps the most human reason of all: Fear of failure and 
humiliation. Confided one personal secretary for a highly successful corporate 
executive who long has been keenly interested in public affairs, "It's his ego. 
He couldn't stand defeat." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times Poll also recently asked ordinary voters for their views 
about the quality of candidates and state government. The responses were mixed 
and, in some ways, indicated that the citizenry is even more cynical about 
elected officials than are the politicians and pundits. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, conducted telephone interviews in late 
May with 1,730 registered California voters. The margin of error was three 
percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the findings: 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly two-thirds of the voters thought that "California state government is 
pretty much run by a few big interests" rather than "for the benefit of all the 
people." This came on the heels of a Times survey last December which showed 
that most voters held legislators in low esteem, believing them to be unethical 
and unproductive. They even thought it commonplace for lawmakers to take 
bribes. 
</P>
<P>
* Roughly three-fourths contended that political candidates generally "are just 
saying what they think the voters want to hear" rather than "being honest with 
the voters." 
</P>
<P>
* But asked to rate the quality of people who then were running for governor -- 
basically Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and 
Republican Sen. Wilson -- more than eight in 10 voters described them as "good 
candidates." 
</P>
<P>
* And when Democratic voters who still were undecided about which gubernatorial 
candidate to support were asked the reason for their indecision, only a few 
said it was because they disliked" the contenders. Nearly two-thirds, however, 
said they didn't know enough about the candidates, indicating they had not been 
paying much attention to them. 
</P>
<P>
* Voters were not very impressed with the caliber of "leadership and vision the 
state government in Sacramento has provided as California prepares for the 21st 
Century." Half said it had provided at least some, but four in 10 thought it 
had offered little if any. Republicans -- apparently loyal to Gov. George 
Deukmejian -- thought more highly of Sacramento's leadership than did 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
* Eight in 10 voters favored "placing limits on the amount of time a public 
official can stay in office." Such a proposal will be on the November ballot as 
part of an ethics package sponsored by Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
* Six in 10 said they would "be willing to have a dollar or two added to 
(their) state income tax to finance political campaigns and eliminate all 
private campaign contributions in California." 
</P>
<P>
* Almost two-thirds said "the current political system discourages the best 
candidates from running for office." 
</P>
<P>
* Asked why they figured "more good people don't run for office," the leading 
reasons given were "they can make more money in private business" and "they 
will be exposed to criticism." But only a relative few surmised that would-be 
candidates "don't like to ask other people for campaign contributions," an 
indication the public does not recognize the real problem that money-grubbing 
creates for politicians and the degree to which it discourages candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, who served as governor from 1958-66, remembered in a 
recent interview what it is like to ask people to dig into their pockets for 
political money. "It's demeaning to go to a. . . ." Then he stopped himself -- 
"not demeaning, that's not the right word, but it's . . ." -- only to be 
interrupted by his wife of nearly 60 years, Bernice, who insisted firmly: 
"That's not a bad word. It expresses it pretty well, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Many current politicians would agree. And campaign costs in this high-tech era 
of computerized mail and $10,000 TV time slots have soared astronomically since 
Brown's day. Deukmejian raised roughly $13 million for his reelection campaign 
in 1986 and Wilson is expected to bank around $20 million this year. About $62 
million was raised for legislative races in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have the ability to raise significant sums of money," Deukmejian 
noted. "Some people are able to do that and others are not. They find it very 
difficult to go out and ask their friends." 
</P>
<P>
Did Deukmejian find it difficult? "Oh, yes. It's a very hard thing to do. And 
unless you've got some close friends who are willing to spend a great deal of 
time doing that, it's a very difficult obstacle to conducting a credible 
campaign. A lot of people decide not to run for office because of that." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph R. Cerrell, a veteran Los Angeles-based political consultant, said of 
fund raising: "I never met a politician who enjoyed it. And it absolutely turns 
off some wonderful people who don't want anything to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Cerrell went on to describe how money distorts campaigns, ethics and 
representative government: 
</P>
<P>
"This game has become so expensive that 90% of what a politician does today is 
raise money. They go by newspaper editorial boards to get a story to show 
contributors. They walk precincts only to get media attention so contributors 
will see they're running and raising money. Once they get elected in November, 
the first thing they have to do is raise money to retire their deficit. Then 
they have to start raising money for the next election. 
</P>
<P>
"How the hell do I (as an officeholder) sit here with you (as a contributor) at 
breakfast and then go make a (voting) decision about you two hours later? They 
never stop thinking money, never stop raising money. As a guy who spends a lot 
of it for his clients, I'm telling you, it's a bad deal." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly is one of the things that drove Gage from the Legislature and 
discourages him from running again. "The amount of money it takes (to win 
office) is appalling," he asserted. "There's a bit of a sickness about it; it 
dominates the political landscape." As a legislator, he added, "I found the 
process a bit eroding. Some colleagues were voting (certain ways) just to stay 
in office." 
</P>
<P>
But for Flanigan and Specht, who excel at fund raising for other politicians, 
the main downside of holding public office is loss of privacy, free time and 
family life. 
</P>
<P>
Specht noted the potential damage to a marriage when spouses live apart -- one 
maintaining a career at home while the other spends most of the week in 
Sacramento. In a comment that was meant to be facetious but nevertheless 
pointed up a real problem for many couples, she said of her husband, Ron 
Rogers, who heads his own public relations firm: "I don't want to leave him 
alone four nights a week. I'm sure he could find somebody to hang around with." 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan said: "I love politics. I'm a political junkie. I'm an example of the 
guy who really wanted to be a candidate, but has found his niche behind the 
scenes. I get all the upsides without the downsides." The downsides, he 
observed, include "the fishbowl existence you lead -- not only you but the 
family -- and the grossly unfair ridicule at times, the really cheap shots." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that motivates people to get involved in politics," he 
continued, "is that they really enjoy the recognition and acclamation of the 
crowd. As student body president (in high school and college) I enjoyed that. 
But somehow I have lost the charge from that recognition. In fact, I think you 
tend to have a better life in today's society if you maintain a lower-key 
visibility and remain anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
Ask former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart about that. The chronicling of Hart's 
extramarital escapades with aspiring actress Donna Rice, in the view of many 
officeholders, is a shining example of the news media's excessive scrutiny of 
politicians' private lives. These critics usually choose to ignore, for sake of 
discussion, that Hart's case was special: He was running for president, the 
ultimate elective office where aspirants receive much more public scrutiny 
than, say, candidates for the Legislature; and Hart, having many times denied 
reports he was a womanizer, virtually challenged reporters to catch him in an 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's a saint and everybody's got a closet and everybody's got skeletons in 
their closet," said Stuart K. Spencer, a veteran Orange County-based political 
consultant who has managed many campaigns for president, governor and the 
Legislature. "For years, we had an unwritten code that if it was a matter of 
public record -- like a drunk driving conviction -- it was fair game. But if 
somebody had a drinking problem or had a girlfriend and it wasn't part of the 
record, we didn't get into all that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it's not important. It is important to some people -- it's not 
to me -- as a measure of character and judgment and all that. I'm not making 
value judgments. But it is a deterrent (to running for office). . . . People 
say, 'I don't want to be exposed to all this hell-raising I did 24 years ago.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
But Spencer, who runs Republican campaigns, said "the first and single biggest 
problem" in recruiting good candidates "is the economic return of public life. 
For somebody who's competent, it doesn't compare to the private sector." 
Several people said that the level of pay is a special impediment for 
Republicans, who tend to be more attracted to private enterprise than to 
government anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, California's governor makes $85,000 annually. The pay is scheduled 
to rise to $103,308 in January. Legislators earn $40,816 -- plus a tax-free 
expense allowance averaging $18,000 and other generous perks. But Proposition 
112, approved by voters in the primary election, established a commission that 
is expected to at least double legislators' pay and also increase the 
governor's. Salaries of Congress members now are almost $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, top business executives and professional people in California 
routinely earn in the six figures and some reach seven figures. Opportunities 
abound in this prosperous, constantly growing, multifaceted state for 
energetic, talented entrepreneurs to make their fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these successful people are action-oriented and decisive. They have 
little patience or respect for the cautious pace and delicate compromising that 
frequently leads to government gridlock or, at best, only partial solutions to 
problems. Clearly, in many cases, this inaction is an intended product of 
democracy's checks and balances as envisioned by the Founding Fathers. But it 
is also, in the view of many people, the inevitable result of the cerebral 
atrophy and finger-to-the-wind timidity of elected officials whose first 
priority is clinging to public office 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Peter Ueberroth, a self-made millionaire businessman who headed the 
acclaimed Los Angeles Olympics and later became commissioner of baseball, was 
widely regarded as a potentially strong GOP candidate for governor this year. 
But after much agonizing he decided not to enter the race, one knowledgeable 
source said, because he "had doubts about whether the governor can make a 
significant difference -- whether a governor effectively can govern anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"It's too hard to get the Legislature to cooperate. The contentious, petty 
nature of the Legislature with the governor discourages people," the source 
said. "And all these (ballot) initiatives have emasculated Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, successful business people do not necessarily make 
successful politicians. Different assets and talents are required -- including 
good looks, oratorical skills and a little showmanship -- first to get elected, 
then to coax legislative votes from colleagues and to lead the people. "It's 
not something you learn -- you either have it or you don't," a veteran state 
Capitol politico noted. "Ronald Reagan had it." 
</P>
<P>
A longtime GOP strategist, who asked not to be identified, said Ueberroth 
actually would have made a poor candidate. "He's too thin-skinned, too 
dictatorial and too strong-willed," this person asserted, adding that as with 
many successful businessmen, "Ueberroth would like to have a coronation, but 
wouldn't like to have an election." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic political consultant Beverly Thomas of Los Angeles put it this way: 
</P>
<P>
"People who are excellent in business and want to 'show 'em how it's done' find 
out that politics has its own set of rules. You can't run it like a business. 
Politics is being able to bob and weave out there and listening to the people. 
Business executives don't have to listen to people. They can make decisions on 
their own. In politics, you really are trying to convince a whole lot of people 
to support you. Business types aren't used to making decisions by consensus." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, said Karen Spencer, Stuart's daughter who has become president of the 
family's consulting firm: "Kids coming up these days are a lot more interested 
in money than in power. If they're interested in getting into politics, they're 
into international trade. They're more capitalistic." 
</P>
<P>
She also pointed out that "a lot of people I'd like to see run are single 
parents (and) women busy raising kids." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Muir, a longtime political science professor at UC Berkeley who also 
wrote speeches in the Reagan White House, said: "For young people, being a 
Democrat is a lot more fun than being a Republican. Democrats enjoy creating 
these 'marvelous' public policies and they go into politics when they're young. 
Republicans go elsewhere, into business. . . . The Reagan era lifted the stigma 
on private enterprise that was there for young people in the '60s and '70s." 
</P>
<P>
But for many, a stigma has developed around politics, largely because of 
corruption scandals in Washington, Sacramento, Los Angeles and elsewhere, but 
also -- many Democrats contend -- because government became an irresistible 
campaign target for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"The public sector has diminished in prestige over the last 20 to 25 years, 
while the private sector has been elevated to a greater degree of respect," 
former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown said. "Ronald Reagan has diminished the 
prestige of government (by attacking it). People respected him and still do. 
And his constant outcry against government has resulted in government not being 
able to do the things it should do." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel K. Whitehurst, who once was considered a rising Democratic star but quit 
as Fresno's mayor after becoming, he said, "a little jaded and cynical," was 
one of several people who said they are discouraged by the increasing 
superficiality of politics with its frivolous issues. What happens, they said, 
is that real problems aren't seriously discussed in campaigns or settled in 
legislative chambers and dedicated people who would like "to make a difference" 
see the futility of it all and remain on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"The tendency is to turn non-issues into issues because they're likely to 
inflame voters," Whitehurst said. "You see it with the flag issue. People try 
to capture media attention with the hot issue of the moment. Meanwhile, 
declining competitiveness, problems in education, the deteriorating 
infrastructure, homelessness, all go unaddressed." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the view of several people who were interviewed, former Deukmejian 
chief-of-staff Steven A. Merksamer, now an attorney, said: 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid, the person I admired more than anyone else was John Kennedy. 
I saw politics as an honorable profession, a lot like the clergy. For whatever 
reason, I don't believe people have that same sense today. So why should 
someone who has high self-esteem desire to move into that kind of environment? 
I don't think I want my son to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of future leadership of the country, we should have some concern. 
Where are the leaders? They are few and far between."

'DEVIL' OF OPIUM ADDICTION RETURNS TO PREY ON CHINA 
</P>

XIAN, China 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gaunt young man in a green sweat shirt put a pinch of brown powder on a piece 
of foil from a cigarette package, held a burning match below it and, as a thin 
wisp of smoke rose, drew it into his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to give up, seven or eight times," he said to a foreigner who had 
been allowed to enter this modern-day opium den only after overcoming 
suspicions that he was an American narcotics agent. "I can't help myself. It's 
my environment. All my friends smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Opium addiction, once widespread in China, was virtually wiped out after the 
1949 Communist revolution. But relaxed social controls and opportunities to 
make money have now opened the door to a new wave of opium use, along with that 
of the opium derivative heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"This devil, stamped out years ago, has reappeared in our country like a 
ghost," the Beijing Youth News said in an article describing the sufferings of 
drug addicts in Xian. "It has not yet generally spread, but it will bring 
disaster if we don't stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Drug use, in addition to its direct effect on users, is contributing to growing 
urban crime and the spread of the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, or AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Here in the ancient city of Xian, gateway to China's far western provinces, 
people blame addicts for a recent wave of taxi-driver killings and other 
violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
In southwestern Yunnan province, near the border with opium-producing areas of 
Myanmar (formerly Burma), authorities have identified 237 heroin addicts 
infected with the virus that causes AIDS. In all the rest of China, health 
authorities have discovered only 68 other people infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago nobody dared do drugs so openly, but nowadays there is nothing 
people don't dare to do," a restaurant owner in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan 
province, told a recent visitor from Beijing. "The typical addict used to be a 
successful private businessman and now doesn't have a penny." 
</P>
<P>
China's drug problem also has international implications. A smugglers' land 
route has been worked out across South China, linking northern Myanmar with the 
British colony of Hong Kong. From there, Myanmar heroin flows out to the United 
States and other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Drug usage in China, while expanding rapidly, is still low by American 
standards. Ordinary users caught by the police face up to a few months of 
imprisonment or enforced rehabilitation. For traffickers, though, penalties are 
severe. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, there were 547 cases of narcotics trafficking nationwide; 749 
traffickers were arrested, and 592 pounds of opium and 634 pounds of heroin 
were seized, according to official statistics. In Yunnan alone, courts 
sentenced 136 traffickers to death last year and 68 others to life 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, authorities cracked China's biggest drug case in 40 years, seizing 
487 pounds of heroin and arresting 51 traffickers, including 41 Chinese 
citizens and 10 dealers from Myanmar, Hong Kong and Macao. Also confiscated was 
1.6 million yuan (about $340,000) in "drug money" and "a large number of guns 
and vehicles," the official New China News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
State-run television last month showed footage of an anti-drug rally at a 
stadium in Yunnan, at which confiscated heroin and opium was destroyed by 
burning and death sentences against 14 drug traffickers were announced. The 14 
traffickers were executed immediately after the rally, according to the New 
China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
A recent visitor to Xian saw four open-backed trucks parading a dozen 
shaven-headed criminals through town, accompanied by a motorcycle escort. The 
evening television news identified them as drug dealers but did not specify 
their fate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to stepped-up enforcement, the authorities are trying to fight back 
with educational campaigns and by establishing rehabilitation centers where 
addicts can go to withdraw from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In Gansu province, west of Xian, a traveler from Beijing recently saw several 
anti-drug roadside billboards. One had drawings that depicted a strong hand 
grasping and crushing three emaciated drug dealers, then showed a shovel 
burying three skulls. "Wage a People's War to Annihilate Drugs," the sign 
exhorted. 
</P>
<P>
At a theater in Xian recently there was a performance of "Drug-Taking 
Penitence," the story of a Qing Dynasty official who ruined his life and family 
with his addiction to opium. 
</P>
<P>
"It's to educate today's young people not to use drugs," said an employee at 
the theater entrance. 
</P>
<P>
He said opium comes to Xian from nearby Gansu and from faraway Yunnan. He then 
gave his views on China's social ills, noting that the late Chairman Mao 
Tse-tung never allowed such things. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody smoked drugs during Mao's era," he said. "Everyone had a job, food to 
eat, and earned about the same amount. Now there are rich people and poor 
people, and many youths don't have work. So sometimes they steal things or use 
drugs. The past few years, social order hasn't been so good, and drugs are a 
big reason. People steal and even kill for money to buy drugs." 
</P>
<P>
A driver for a hotel in Xian echoed this view. 
</P>
<P>
"Several taxi drivers have been killed in the past year," he said, and added 
that he refuses to take a job that would require him to pick up people on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't used to be like this," he went on. "It's because young people don't 
have work, but they have to eat and have to buy clothes. And it's because 
they've started to smoke opium. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to smoke it at first, but someone says, 'Oh, try it,' and then 
they get addicted and have to buy it. They smoke 10 packets a day, and each 
packet costs 20 yuan (about $4). That's 200 yuan a day. No one makes that much 
money. They have to steal." 
</P>
<P>
The official Chinese news media, in warning of the dangers of drugs, sometimes 
publicize lurid accounts of the sufferings of addicts and their families. 
</P>
<P>
In Xian, the driver said, the authorities recently publicized the case of an 
entrepreneur who became addicted to opium. 
</P>
<P>
"He pushed his wife into addiction, and she eventually became a prostitute to 
support the habit," he said. "Then they turned their 4-year-old daughter over 
to another family to raise. The paper they signed didn't call it selling the 
child, but that's what it really was. He got several thousand yuan and used 
that for opium." 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Youth News said that a drug addict in Xian named Zhang Qiang 
feigned an accident in an attempt to extort money from the driver of a tractor 
who passed by his home. This is a trick known to young hoodlums all across 
China and feared by many drivers. 
</P>
<P>
When his addiction "began to show its effect again," the newspaper said, Zhang 
"twisted, twitched and tossed until he lost all his strength. Then his whole 
body became cold. It was a hot day, but he wrapped himself in a quilt. Still he 
kept shivering. He couldn't bear it anymore; he needed to get opium now!" 
</P>
<P>
According to the periodical, Zhang seized a kitchen knife and ran outside, 
where a tractor hauling a load of sand and stone was passing his gate. "He 
deliberately fell down and rolled in front of the tractor," the account 
continued. "The driver slammed on the brakes but nearly ran over his body. . . 
. Zhang jumped up and rushed to the driver, who had already stepped down. 
Grabbing the driver's collar, he demanded 100 yuan (about $20) for medical 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
When the driver refused and tried to drive away, the addict slashed him with 
the knife, robbed him and tried to flee, the paper said. Onlookers seized Zhang 
and beat him unconscious, and the police sent him to a hospital drug 
rehabilitation ward, where the Beijing Youth News reporter learned of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Until the past few years, drug-related crime was virtually unknown in most of 
China. But in Yunnan province, the Communists never succeeded in totally 
suppressing opium use. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugs have always been available in Yunnan," a Kunming watch repairman told a 
foreign student. "My neighbor never stopped even during the Cultural 
Revolution, because opium was still widely available. It was so cheap to buy it 
then. Nobody spent much." 
</P>
<P>
Heroin is now available in the Kunming black market for about $20 a gram, 10 
times what it costs at the Myanmar border but only about half the price in 
Canton, the South China city near Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great for the big businessmen who deal it," the Kunming restaurant owner 
said. "They don't smoke it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
As in other countries, drug dealing in China has shadowy links with other forms 
of organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
According to the foreigner who visited the Xian opium den, the addicts there 
"kept alluding to this black society," and one commented: "You have any trouble 
in Xian, just come to us, we'll help you. We have friends." 
</P>
<P>
In Gansu province, just west of Xian, railroad security officers arrested 85 
alleged drug addicts and dealers at railroad stations in May and June as part 
of a province-wide crackdown, according to the newspaper Legal Daily. The 
authorities also closed six places used for producing, selling or taking drugs, 
the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Such raids seem to be a sign of tougher action to come. 
</P>
<P>
"We should crack down hard," a commentator said in the Gansu Daily in early 
May. "We should arrest and convict drug criminals, put some of them through 
reform by labor, and firmly impose the death penalty on those who are guilty of 
the most heinous crimes, so as to arouse the people's spirit and deter 
criminals. We should focus on cracking down on drug syndicates and, at the same 
time, set deadlines for drug users to kick their habits or impose mandatory 
habit-kicking." 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Youth News, in its article on Xian addicts, pleaded for society at 
large to "understand, pay attention to and solve" the opium problem. "We must 
kill it again before it spreads," the paper declared. 
</P>
<P>
But the authorities no longer exercise the kind of control over Chinese society 
they had in the first decades of Communist rule. Greater privacy and freedom of 
movement have created a new situation in which the total elimination of drug 
use seems impossible. 
</P>
<P>
This is most obvious in the border areas of Yunnan. 
</P>
<P>
"There are plenty of banned substances flowing through here," a resident of 
Dali, a town west of Kunming, told a traveler from Beijing. "The government 
cannot check effectively enough to stop the trade." 
</P>
<P>
Times researcher Nick Driver contributed to this story.

ANTI-SEMITIC TIDE PERILOUS, PRAVDA SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: PARTY PAPER WARNS THAT RAPIDLY GROWING PREJUDICE UNDERMINES 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-Semitism is growing rapidly in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party 
newspaper Pravda acknowledged Sunday, and it now threatens to undermine the 
country's political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda denounced not only the open anti-Semitism of groups on the far right, 
such as the nationalistic Pamyat, which blame Jews for all the country's 
problems past and present, but also that of Russian nationalists who use 
anti-Semitism in their efforts to revive Russian culture. 
</P>
<P>
"This unprecedented anti-Semitism is of great concern because we face an 
attempt to disrupt the process of social consolidation," Pravda said in an 
article signed by a Soviet historian, S. Rogov. "A law-based state must protect 
people of every nationality." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the strongest official warnings against anti-Semitism, the newspaper 
said that the country, if it aspires to democracy, cannot quietly content 
itself with the expectation that the "Jewish question," a term that itself has 
an anti-Semitic undertone here, will be solved when the country's 1.9 million 
Jews have emigrated. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, in a break from official assessments in the past, argued that the 
problem is much broader than acknowledged up to now and that it affects the 
whole of Soviet society and its efforts at political, economic and social 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated warnings over the past year and a half from the Jewish 
communities in Moscow, Leningrad and other major Jewish centers in the country, 
Soviet officials have been unwilling to recognize the rapid, even frightening 
growth in anti-Semitism and its implications for the country. 
</P>
<P>
Even when foreign leaders, including President Bush and Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III, have raised the question, Soviet officials have done little 
more than to speak of "social tensions" as a result of the country's severe 
economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, although approaching the issue in terms of the "Jewish question," 
Zionism and emigration, went well beyond the previous official position to 
report, in unambiguously critical terms, the growth of anti-Semitism and the 
threat it represents. 
</P>
<P>
"A large number of extremist groups have appeared in the country," the paper 
said. "Pamyat and the like are openly reviving anti-Semitism as a means of 
their struggle against perestroika. They use such classic falsifications as the 
'Protocols of the Elders of Zion,' which had been fabricated by the Czarist 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"Again and again, they exploit the myth of the 'Yid-Mason-Bolshevik conspiracy' 
against Russia. Jews are being blamed for killing the Czar's family and the 
Stalinist repressions, the forced collectivization, the corruption of the 
national culture and the destruction of the ecology. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, political anti-Semitism is being cultivated by a number of 
literary publications as well. Every issue runs odious speculations. For the 
first time in our history, anti-Semitism has become quite popular in some 
intellectual circles." 
</P>
<P>
Asking why anti-Semitism could not simply be outlawed, Pravda contended that 
this could also be used as an argument for banning Zionism as "a rejection of a 
democratic solution for the Jewish question in a multinational state." 
</P>
<P>
"That is why we cannot 'ban' criticism of the Zionist ideology," the paper 
said, "and why provocative activities of openly anti-Soviet, pro-fascist 
movements (such as the Jewish Defense League of Meir Kahane) cannot enjoy 
immunity either." 
</P>
<P>
However, Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation, the largest 
of the Soviet republics, said last month that he favors legislation outlawing 
anti-Semitism and those organizations that promote it. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to pass a law to put a barrier before those organizations that 
tend to develop in fascist directions," Yeltsin said. "That is absolutely 
inadmissible." 
</P>
<P>
A major result of the growth of anti-Semitism has been to encourage Soviet Jews 
to emigrate at an ever-faster pace, the article said, forecasting that Jewish 
emigration this year will run between 200,000 and 300,000. In the first half of 
1990, 50,000 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel, according to reports from 
Jerusalem, and the projected total for the year is 165,000.

"The number of visa applications is growing," Pravda said. "One cannot but see 
that the fear of pogroms is acquiring the scale of a panic. Visa documents are 
being issued for people who are far from sharing the ideas of political 
Zionism. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem cannot and should not be solved through mass emigration. The 
Jewish question should be solved democratically in the Soviet Union. This 
should not impede natural assimilation or threaten Jewish culture or prevent 
Jews from going to Israel or any other state. Jewish cultural institutions 
should, meanwhile, develop freely and democratically to satisfy the natural 
ethnic requirements of Soviet Jews."

<P>
President Samuel K. Doe is a virtual prisoner in his oceanfront fortress, with 
rebels besieging the capital and his 500-member presidential guard refusing to 
let him flee without them, military sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Other government soldiers are pushing the president to flee to avoid a blood 
bath, the sources said, sparking bitter infighting inside the executive 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
The contingent guarding Doe is made up of soldiers from his Krahn tribe, who 
fear massacre at the hands of the rebels. The insurgents are mostly from the 
rival Gio and Mano ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, meanwhile, had advanced to within a mile of Doe's mansion and were 
locked in street combat with Doe's regular troops, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Doe, in a telex to the British Broadcasting Corp. on Sunday afternoon, said he 
would remain until "a clear victor emerges." 
</P>
<P>
The president remains "convinced he is invincible," a diplomatic source said. 
</P>
<P>
As disaster nears, the 38-year-old former army master sergeant who seized power 
10 years ago is reverting increasingly to the tribal belief that magic will 
save him, the source added. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting continued close to the heart of Monrovia. Rebel troops have 
overrun all of the Bushrod Island district containing the port, fuel and 
storage depots and repair shops. They were trying to capture the two key 
bridges leading directly into the city center. 
</P>
<P>
Sources inside the mansion said Doe's Krahn bodyguards had gathered Saturday 
with Doe and told him they would refuse to allow him to leave unless they are 
granted safe passage to their home territory in Grand Gedeh County, Doe's last 
stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
But Charles Taylor's rebel National Patriotic Front of Liberia is expected to 
fiercely resist any effort by Doe to evacuate his forces to his home region. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels have accused Doe of corruption, mismanagement and human rights 
abuses.

E. GERMAN COALITION DELAYS UNITY DECISION; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: GROUP AVOIDS COLLAPSE BY TURNING UNIFICATION SCHEDULE OVER TO A JOINT 
EAST-WEST COMMITTEE.

<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany's ruling coalition avoided collapse Sunday by putting off a highly 
sensitive decision on the timing of unification with West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
After often heated debate at an unusual Sunday sitting of the East German 
Parliament, the Liberal Party's parliamentary leader, Rainer Ortleb, announced 
agreement to hand the decision over to a joint committee from East and West 
German parliaments scheduled to meet next month. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute does not place in doubt that the two Germanys will enter a 
political union about the time of the planned all-German election in early 
December. But exactly when this union occurs has become an issue so divisive 
that it has threated to split the coalition that has governed East Germany 
since March. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is complex, but because it turns on election politics, it is one 
every member of the 400-seat Volkskammer understands. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that would effectively block smaller East German political parties 
from winning seats in an all-German election, the Liberals and Social Democrats 
-- both junior members of the Christian Democrat-led coalition -- have joined 
forces to press for East Germany's legal accession to West Germany to take 
place on Dec. 1, the day before the all-German elections. 
</P>
<P>
Such a move would mean that contests in all constituencies would be governed by 
West German election laws. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to elect a real all-German Parliament and take it seriously, then 
we must, as far as possible, make the conditions for such an election the same 
for all candidates and voters," argued the Social Democrats' parliamentary 
leader, Richard Schroeder, during Sunday's debate. 
</P>
<P>
However, behind this lofty aim is the reality that such timing would 
effectively exclude minor East German parties, including those who helped mount 
last autumn's popular revolution, by subjecting them to the West German 
requirement that a party must poll at least 5% of the popular vote to be 
entitled to any seats. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the makeup of these parties, their exclusion under West German rules 
would probably help the Social Democrats and the Liberals most in an election. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's Christian Democrats, plus the smaller East 
German parties, want the election fought under the separate laws of East and 
West Germany, with East Germany proclaiming its union with West Germany 
immediately after the polls close Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Under legal mechanics already agreed upon, unity will occur under Article 23 of 
the West German constitution, which stipulates that "other parts of Germany" 
may accede if they so desire. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, who claims his position is based mainly on the fairness of letting 
as many East German parties as possible win seats in an all-German Parliament, 
knows that the smaller party representation would likely reduce the 
parliamentary strength of the country's second-biggest party and his main 
political opponents, the Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The East German Parliament also voted Sunday to re-establish five states 
abolished by the Communists in 1952 in a move to consolidate central state 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Elections for governments in those states -- Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, 
Saxony, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia -- were scheduled for Oct. 14.

EDUCATION BRIEFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A MATTER OF CHOICE: The battle over Choice goes on. Allowing parents to pick 
their children's public schools is a pet idea of the Bush Administration that 
is appealing to conservatives because it would cost little or nothing and it 
fits the free-market philosophy. Educators remain skeptical, however. 
</P>
<P>
Choice received its most significant intellectual boost recently when the 
Brookings Institution published a lengthy report by political scientists John 
E. Chubb of Brookings and Terry M. Moe of Stanford University. After analyzing 
500 public and private schools, Chubb and Moe concluded that the most effective 
American schools are those most free from the bureaucratic controls of school 
boards and state departments of education. 
</P>
<P>
Chubb and Moe went on to recommend that any school that meets state standards 
in areas such as graduation requirements and teacher certification be 
considered a public school. Parents would shop around and pick a school, and 
the school district would send money to that school to pay the child's tuition. 
Good schools thus would prosper and ineffective ones would go bankrupt in this 
marketplace of education. 
</P>
<P>
PARENT PARTICIPATION: Regardless of whether they favor the Choice system, 
critics of public education agree that American schools will not improve unless 
parents become more involved with them. In a recent survey of eighth-graders 
throughout the country, the U.S. Department of Education found that 47.5% of 
parents had never contacted their child's school about his or her work, and 75% 
had never taken part in any activity of a parent-teacher organization. 
</P>
<P>
Parents sometimes feel that distance, working hours and cultural unfamiliarity 
make it difficult for them to have anything to do with a school, and some 
school districts are trying to unravel this problem. In some Kentucky schools, 
according to federal officials, phones have been put into every classroom to 
encourage parents to call teachers at any time. In St. Paul, children are 
allowed to go to school near where their parents work, to make it easier for a 
mother or father to take the time for a school visit. 
</P>
<P>
CLASS DIFFERENCES: In a 1988 survey of eighth-graders, the Department of 
Education's National Center for Education Statistics interviewed almost 25,000 
pupils across the country about all phases of school life. Their answers shed 
some new light on ethnic differences in achievement. 
</P>
<P>
White students usually score higher than blacks and Latinos on most tests, but 
the survey found that these differences are reduced by 25% to 30% when 
socioeconomic status is taken into account. Thus, while only 6% of blacks are 
proficient in the advanced level of mathematics, 21% of blacks in the highest 
quarter of socioeconomic status (based on parents' level of education, 
occupation and income) are proficient at the advanced level. Economic class is 
clearly a key factor in racial and ethnic differences. 
</P>
<P>
The federal researchers this year are again interviewing the same children, now 
that they are in 10th grade, and intend to interview them again in 1992, when 
they are high school seniors, for one of the most extensive studies ever 
undertaken by the Department of Education.

AMERICAN ALBUM: A 'DRY' TOWN GETS ITS FIRST TASTE OF ALCOHOL SALES; 
</P>
<P>
HOBOKEN, GA., OFFICIALS SAY BEER AND WINE WILL BOOST TAX REVENUES. OPPONENTS 
SAY THE COST IS TOO HIGH.

HOBOKEN, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had been a long time, about 50 years, some say, since folks around here 
could buy brew legally. 
</P>
<P>
Hoboken, a town of some 400 people, nestled in the piney woods of south 
Georgia, was July-dry, although its neighbors were wet. Drinkers grumbled some, 
but they put up with the situation until they recently got a little help from a 
bad situation: The town needed tax money. 
</P>
<P>
So, officials here turned to a proven money-raiser -- wine and beer sales, 
hoping that a tax on the sales would bolster Hoboken's $150,000 annual budget. 
"We thought we could get enough revenue to keep (other) taxes down," explained 
Linda Martin, the town clerk. 
</P>
<P>
That remains to be seen. But already it is clear that going wet has wreaked 
profound changes on this little community. It did not, of course, go gentle 
into the wet world. The issue of whether to allow alcohol sales pit neighbor 
against neighbor, Baptist against Baptist and drinker against nondrinker. 
</P>
<P>
During contentious City Council meetings, arguments raged not only over the 
evils of alcohol but over the philosophy of governing and whether the council 
members remembered whatthey had been taught in their high school government 
classes. In the end, an ordinance passed 4 to 3 (the mayor broke a 3-3 council 
tie) allowing beer and wine sales to begin in June. But no drinking is allowed 
on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
Strong feelings remain on both sides. Nevertheless, Hoboken, now like a million 
other little towns across America, has a convenience store where you can dash 
for gas and beer in one stop. Jack's Country Mall was granted the first license 
to sell alcohol. On the little store's sales counter is a familiar sign: 
"Without pictured ID, this is a dry store." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it's wet," Charles Moore said the other day as he and his buddy, 
Jesse Trull, headed for their pickup after picking up a couple of bottles of 
beer. "We were rooting for them to get a license." 
</P>
<P>
Some people liked Hoboken dry because it made the town special, quaint, keeping 
some connection with the past and, they thought, offering a shield against the 
oppressive, crime-ridden present. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Stevens vows to campaign against the mayor and City Council in hopes of 
getting the wet ordinance repealed. 
</P>
<P>
The new law is "a tragedy," said Stevens, a kindergarten teacher. "Look at our 
nation. The No. 1 problem is alcohol abuse." Moreover, she complained that when 
her three children attend Hoboken Baptist Church and go to Jack's Country Mall, 
which is nearby, they can't buy treats without confronting alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not necessary to have bubble gum and beer side by side," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Nelson Clark, who is half of the town's police force, said there has 
been "no difference" in crime or litter since sales began in June. "Not selling 
it hadn't stopped one person from drinking" because they simply bought drinks 
in neighboring towns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of Georgia's 159 counties -- Echols and Union -- are completely dry, 
although some jurisdictions in the wet counties remain dry, as did the old 
Hoboken within Brantley County. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still some rural areas that are influenced by the Bible Belt 
mentality and think it's a sin to drink," said Lyn Paddrik, executive director 
of the Georgia Beer Wholesalers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The association, in low-key fashion, reminds these areas that the sales they 
eschew are slurped up elsewhere. Paddrik noted that Atlanta gained $7.6 million 
in beer taxes last year. And, just east of here, the town of Nahunta, Ga., took 
in $15,845. 
</P>
<P>
At just over a third Nahunta's size, Hoboken cannot expect to do so well. "We 
don't have any idea what it's going to bring in," said Martin, the town clerk. 
</P>
<P>
And having seen the furor ignited by the beer and wine ordinance, Martin said: 
"We're not messing with hard liquor." 
</P>
<P>
That's all right with Jack's Country Mall. Store manager Janice O'Neal reports 
that under the new ordinance, the place is "doing good. Sales have doubled. 
When they come in to buy the beer, they buy everything else."

The third time proved to be the charm for a Longboat Key man who won top honors 
Sunday in the Ernest Hemingway Look-Alike Contest, part of Key West's 10th 
annual tribute to the Nobel Prize-winning author. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Burnham, competing for a third consecutive year, attributed the victory to 
his having raised a shaggy, gray beard reminiscent of the late novelist's. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year I didn't even qualify (for the finals)," said Burnham, who owns 
a construction cleanup firm. "But the comaraderie and good times kept me coming 
back." 
</P>
<P>
The 63 Hemingway look-alikes, from as far away as Santa Rosa, Calif., competed 
"head to head" for three days at Sloppy Joe's, which bills itself as 
Hemingway's favorite bar on Key West. 
</P>
<P>
While living on Key West in the 1930s, Hemingway produced some of his most 
famous works, including "For Whom the Bell Tolls," "A Farewell to Arms," "The 
Snows of Kilimanjaro" and "Green Hills of Africa." 
</P>
<P>
To honor Hemingway's literary genius, each year the festival includes a short 
story writing competition. "If You Can Hear This," by Pamela Ball, of 
Tallahassee, this year took top honors out of 620 entries.

JOE TURNER; EXPATRIATE JAZZ PIANIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American jazz pianist and occasional singer Joe Turner, a longtime resident of 
France and in the 1960s a fixture at Paris' La Calvados club, died Saturday in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters news agency said he was 82 but did not disclose a cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, who in his career accompanied such jazz stars as Louis Armstrong and 
Benny Carter, was born in Baltimore but moved to Europe after World War II 
where he had toured earlier with singer Adelaide Hall. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Turner, sometimes confused with blues singer Joseph (Big Joe) Turner, 
returned to the United States and played at the Cookery in New York City, where 
his stride piano style was acclaimed anew. 
</P>
<P>
He recorded with his own trio in the late 1970s.

J.R. BOND; EX-ROAD &amp; TRACK CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John R. Bond, former publisher and driving force behind the success of Road 
&amp; Track magazine, has died. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
He died Friday at his home in Escondido after a long bout with emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
Bond was well respected throughout the automotive world and had an 
international reputation as an automotive journalist with a gift for writing 
about technical matters in laymen's terms. 
</P>
<P>
In 1949, Bond and his second wife, Elaine, bought Newport Beach-based Road 
&amp; Track when it was a struggling, 2-year-old magazine on the brink of 
folding. 
</P>
<P>
"With a lot of hard work, they made it rise to what it is today," said Bond's 
son, John R. Bond Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Schooled as an automotive engineer who once designed motorcycles for Harley 
Davidson, Bond owned the magazine until 1972, when he sold it to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
As publisher, Bond instituted such staples of automotive journalism as the 
technical road test. 
</P>
<P>
"My father lived, breathed, slept, ate and dreamed cars," Bond Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Bond maintained his interest in cars up until his death, filling his 30-car 
garage with the vehicles he owned, his son said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his son, Bond is survived by his wife, Mercedes, a daughter, Marilee 
Nudo, a sister, Virginia Bundy, and a brother, William Bond.

Dr. Arthur T. Hertig, whose studies on human embryos helped lead to the 
development of the birth control pill and in-vitro fertilization, died Friday 
at 86 at a hospital here after colon surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The researcher, a retired professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School who 
lived in nearby Lexington, was known at the school for his work with fetuses 
less than two weeks old. 
</P>
<P>
From 1952 to 1968, he was chairman of the pathology department. 
</P>
<P>
With Dr. John Rock of the Carnegie Institute of Washington, Hertig studied life 
at the youngest state ever observed, including an ovum only 60 hours old. From 
their research came the successful transplantation of fertilized eggs and 
infertility therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Hertig, a gynecological pathologist, also studied ovarian tumors, gynecological 
cancers and miscarriages. His research was credited by other scientists with 
leading to the development of the birth control pill. 
</P>
<P>
After 37 years at the medical school, Hertig resigned in 1970 to study the 
morphology of primate ovaries at the New England Regional Primate Research 
Center.

Room of the Biltmore, smiling and shaking hands as the 300 invited guests 
parted to make way for the procession. 
</P>
<P>
They took their places behind a long breakfast table as TV cameras rolled, 
flash bulbs popped and people craned their necks for a better view. Then, the 
packed banquet room turned silent as Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji stood to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"Our visit is not to convince anyone of our ideology," Zhu said. "Many 
Americans don't understand the living conditions in China, don't understand the 
gap between Chinese and American culture. 
</P>
<P>
"We must continue opening China up and modernizing." 
</P>
<P>
Zhu, 61, is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the United States 
since the Chinese government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations 
in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
This month, Zhu and six other mayors have stopped in Washington, New York, 
Chicago and several other cities, seeking to revive business interests in 
China. During meetings with elected officials and public appearances, they have 
pleaded for patience and understanding of the political turmoil in their 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, a New York-based educational 
organization that arranges high-level exchanges with China, is sponsoring the 
mayors' visit. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the mayors are scheduled to have breakfast with Armand Hammer, chairman 
of Occidental Petroleum Corp.; meet Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley in City Hall; 
visit McDonnell Douglas' Douglas Aircraft Co. and the RAND Corp., and have 
dinner with the Los Angeles-Guangzhou Sister City Assn. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the mayors will leave for San Francisco, where they plan several 
meetings with Mayor Art Agnos, tours of UC Berkeley and Stanford University, 
and the Silicon Valley in the San Jose-Santa Clara area. 
</P>
<P>
But the trip isn't entirely for business purposes. Sunday afternoon, the mayors 
headed for Disneyland, where, like other tourists, they planned to take 
photographs with Disney characters and view the Main St. Electrical Parade, 
said Disneyland spokesman Paul Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
At the Biltmore, most of the guests' questions were directed to Zhu, whom U.S. 
officials consider to be a possible future leader of China. He has been 
compared to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev because of his extensive 
exposure to Western economic thinking, and is credited with handling thousands 
of democracy demonstrators in Shanghai without the use of martial law. 
</P>
<P>
The mayors each took their turns delivering short speeches, hailing 
technological and educational advances that have taken place in their 
respective cities. Several expressed concerns that the democracy movement has 
shattered some Americans' respect for China. 
</P>
<P>
"They're afraid that after the movement China is returning to oppressive 
conditions of the past," said Chongqing Mayor Sun Tongchuan. "China is not 
going to go back on its economic policies." 
</P>
<P>
The other mayors are Zhao Baojiang of Wuhan; Wan Liangshi of Taiyuan, and Zhong 
Yongsan of Hefei. Geng Dianhua, mayor of Ningbo, was in Houston on Sunday and 
was scheduled to join the delegation later.

TWO WOMEN TAKE LIVES BY SETTING SELVES AFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A woman who set herself afire in a Highland Park street early Saturday morning 
died Sunday of massive burns, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Only hours after the incident that led to the death of Louisa Jiminez, a 
Tujunga woman killed herself when she torched her car on a mountain road and 
climbed inside. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators said Rubie S. Poublane, 26, died 
shortly after she set her car ablaze on the side of a road in the Angeles 
National Forest at about 11 a.m. Saturday, and then sat inside the burning 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Although no suicide note was discovered, Poublane was apparently distraught 
over an illness and family troubles, Deputy Rafael Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
Jiminez, 35, doused herself with a flammable liquid and set herself ablaze in 
the street in front of her Highland Park home, Los Angeles Police Sgt. John 
Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors extinguished the flames with water from a garden hose, although 
Jiminez pleaded for them to leave her alone. She was taken to Huntington 
Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, suffering third-degree burns over 90% of her 
body. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez -- the mother of a 2-year-old boy and two girls, 1 and 4 -- died at 
3:46 p.m. Sunday, said Suzanne Schimpeler, the hospital's administrative 
director. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, Jiminez had told her husband, Jose, that she was despondent 
over the family's living conditions, Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she was sick of the cockroaches and her dirty house," the sergeant 
said. "She had asked her husband to set her on fire to purify her. He refused 
and tried to calm her down. When they went to bed he thought it was over." 
</P>
<P>
About 6 a.m., Johnston said, Jiminez awoke, went outside and set herself on 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Manzo, a neighbor who was gardening, initially mistook the woman's body 
for a pile of burning trash. When Manzo ran closer to investigate the fire, she 
saw it was her neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Manzo alerted another neighbor, then ran home and filled a container with water 
to pour on the body. 
</P>
<P>
"(Jiminez) looked up at us and, in a hoarse whisper, said, 'No water, no 
water,' " recalled Manzo. 
</P>
<P>
As neighbors doused Jiminez, Jose awoke to the commotion in the street. When he 
stepped out of the house, he saw his wife. Neighbors said he stood in the 
street with a glazed look, crying his wife's name and asking, "What have you 
done?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's unusual to have something like this, where two people try to kill 
themselves by fire on the same day," Estrada said. "There are a lot of ways to 
commit suicide, but setting yourself on fire . . . well, that's not something 
we see everyday."

JUDGE UPHOLDS COUNTY'S RIGHT TO TEST JOB APPLICANTS FOR DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
WORKER RIGHTS: UNIONS ASKED FOR AN INJUNCTION TO HALT THE NEW PROGRAM. INVOLVED 
ARE SENSITIVE AND SAFETY-RELATED POSITIONS SUCH AS LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A major legal hurdle has been cleared in Los Angeles County's efforts to 
administer drug tests to applicants for certain "sensitive" jobs in county 
government. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of unions representing 30,000 workers had been seeking a court 
order to halt the program. But last week, Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffee 
turned down the unions' request for a preliminary injunction, ruling that under 
state law the county has the right to test the job applicants without 
submitting the issue to union-management negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"If the county wants to make darn sure that they don't hire a drug user for a 
sensitive position, they can do it," Yaffee said. 
</P>
<P>
He ruled that the county could implement the program unilaterally because it is 
not directed against present county employees. 
</P>
<P>
The new drug testing program, initiated by county officials July 2, requires 
applicants for certain county jobs to submit to drug testing. Among jobs 
covered by the new guidelines are public safety positions, such as sheriff's 
deputies, lifeguards and firefighters; driver positions, such as chauffeurs and 
trash truck operators, and positions that involve significant financial 
responsibilities, such as accountants. 
</P>
<P>
County employees who apply for transfers to such jobs are subject to the 
testing, as well as applicants from outside the county ranks. So far, county 
officials said, only sheriff's deputy trainees have been tested. 
</P>
<P>
The unions sought the preliminary injunction to stop the program until the 
County Employee Relations Commission can hear their complaint of unfair 
employee relations practices, which was sparked by the county's failure to 
bargain with the unions before implementing the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"The unions don't condone drug use, but we feel the program should not have 
been implemented without union bargaining," said Alexander Cvitan, attorney for 
the workers' coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right of employers to demand drug tests 
for employment applicants or personnel who have been involved in on-the-job 
accidents and for those who take periodic physical exams as a condition of 
employment. Lawyers who represent labor unions believe that the court has yet 
to rule definitively whether purely random tests are constitutional or if they 
violate the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the California Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that 
employers cannot fire or punish workers who refuse to submit to random tests. 
The ruling was based on California's constitutional privacy protections. 
</P>
<P>
The county, however, has not implemented random testing. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, the Southern California Rapid Transit District last year began 
administering random drug tests to its 7,000 drivers and mechanics, and the Los 
Angeles Police Department ordered mandatory random drug testing of its 
captains, commanders and deputy chiefs beginning May 1. Those who test positive 
for illegal drugs face being fired. 
</P>
<P>
A program that would require 6,000 other city police to be tested randomly once 
a year is under negotiation with the police union.

SHARED HOUSING OFFERS SINGLE MOMS RECOURSE; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL SERVICES: A NEW SOUTH COUNTY GROUP IS BRINGING LOW-INCOME MOTHERS 
TOGETHER AND MATCHING THEM WITH SENIORS WILLING TO SHARE A HOME. 
</P>

<P>
Michelle Ellis works and lives in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
But home for Ellis, 23, and her 10-month-old son, Ryan, is not one of the 
expensive houses that have mushroomed in this sprawling, affluent South County 
community. It's her tan 1983 Toyota Camry parked on the street in front of the 
home where she works as a housekeeper during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis is among a growing number of low-income single mothers who can no longer 
afford the high cost of housing and child care in South County. Like Ellis, 
many single mothers are homeless, while others are "just a man away" from 
living on the streets, officials of several local social agencies say. 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon is part of a national trend that has recently caught the 
attention of several Orange County agencies. 
</P>
<P>
A report released last month by the National Displaced Homemakers Network in 
Washington indicates that 47.6% of single mothers -- those who have never 
married or, if previously married, now work full time to support their children 
-- live with incomes at or near poverty levels. The report, based on census 
data, also notes that the number of single mothers grew from 3.2 million in 
1980 to 5.8 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Detailed statistics for Orange County are not available, but Larry Leaman, 
director of the Orange County Social Services Agency, said that at least 17,000 
single mothers in the county live on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
The number has increased by 10% each year since 1988, he said. "Each mother 
accounts for two kids, so we're looking at a lot of people getting by on a 
minimal subsistence," Leaman said. 
</P>
<P>
The increase is straining the resources of social service agencies, many of 
which rely on private donations and volunteer workers to meet the needs of 
their clients. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Gilchrist, program manager of the Episcopal Service Alliance/South 
County, said that at least 30% of the 2,000 people who seek help from her 
agency each month are single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
They also account for 25% of the homeless people who live in the agency's 
Anchor House shelter in San Clemente, Gilchrist said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crisis, and the sad part is few people know about the problem," said 
Lynn Joseph, a San Juan Capistrano businesswoman who recently helped form an 
organization called Single Mothers in Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem just slipped through the cracks," Joseph continued. "We're going 
to have a young generation out there who will remember their childhood growing 
up on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the creation of Single Mothers was serendipitous. Joseph, a 
partner in an executive search firm, said she felt the need to contribute 
"something back to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Four months ago, she told Dr. Thomas Habib, a clinical psychologist, that she 
would be interested in volunteering some of her time. 
</P>
<P>
Habib, director of psychological services at South County Community Clinic, 
seized the opportunity to help form a new agency. 
</P>
<P>
"In my practice, I see many cases where marriages end up in divorce and the 
mother faces hardship," Habib said. "At times I have three or four single moms 
on my caseload at once. . . . But for ethical reasons, I couldn't bring them 
together. I would say to myself, 'Boy, I wish there was an organization to put 
them together.' " 
</P>
<P>
For the last three months, Joseph has been busy contacting social agencies and 
circulating flyers advertising a July 27 mixer that will be held in the 
gymnasium of Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The event will include brief workshops on sharing housing and caring for 
children, but the main purpose is to put single mothers in contact with others 
in similar situations. Interested people can call (714) 493-0050 to register. 
</P>
<P>
Habib said the new organization is advocating formation of so-called 
three-generation families involving the child, the parent and a senior. "We are 
desperately seeking elderly people who are looking to share life's experiences 
with single mothers," the psychologist said. "Elderly people are so important 
to us. People don't become obsolete; they just need to feel needed." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of shared housing is not new to Orange County. Seventeen independent 
shared-housing programs in the county comprise the Shared Housing Coordination 
Project, a venture funded by the Orange County Housing Authority. But none is 
specifically geared toward single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Single mothers are the hardest to place" in shared housing, said Roberto 
Melendez, the project's coordinator. "That's why (such an organization) is 
extremely needed in the community. We are called repeatedly by single parents 
who wish to cut housing costs by rooming with a senior. . . . But many 
(seniors) do not want to act as baby-sitters to children." 
</P>
<P>
Melendez and Leaman said Single Mothers would fill a gap in Orange County. 
"Shared housing is a matter of economic reality," Leaman said. "We are 
intrigued by the attempt to do something about the problem (in South County)." 
</P>
<P>
Many single mothers encounter hardship when they lose financial support through 
separation or divorce. The majority are in low-paying jobs and cannot afford 
the high cost of renting an apartment in South County along with child-care 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
When Beth Powell, 20, got divorced and left El Paso with her 2 1/2-year-old 
daughter, Reagan, for Mission Viejo, the culture shock was immediate: A 
two-bedroom apartment that cost $350 per month in El Paso was $800 in South 
County. A baby-sitter cost $400 a month, compared to $200 in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely incredible," said Powell, who earns $1,000 a month as an 
assistant manager of a Laguna Hills clothing store. "I'm still in shock. I 
thought about moving back to El Paso, because there's no way I could make it on 
my own here." 
</P>
<P>
Powell said she needs to acquire a college education to earn a better salary. 
She had signed up for classes at Saddleback College, but her work schedule and 
time spent caring for Reagan prevented her from attending. 
</P>
<P>
Now she sees hope in the opportunity offered by Single Mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping I can find someone compatible with myself and my daughter," Powell 
said. "I think someone with another child would be more flexible, more 
understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all her problems, Ellis -- who lives in her car in Mission Viejo -- 
believes she has been fortunate since separating from her drug-addicted 
boyfriend a few months ago. She said she decided to leave her boyfriend's 
apartment after he became physically and verbally abusive to her and her child. 
</P>
<P>
Now she uses the $400 she earns monthly to take care of herself and baby Ryan. 
"If I had to go to a normal job, I would have to get someone to see my baby," 
she said. "But I couldn't afford that."

IT'S A FAMILY AFFAIR AT FIREHOUSE; 2 GENERATIONS TAKE UP THE BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
In their 31 years with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Emmett and John 
Kinney have seen it all: brush fires, industrial fires, house fires, the Watts 
Riot fires and untold accidents and crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday, the two brothers did something they'd never done before. They 
worked in Willowbrook's Fire Station 41 with two of Emmett's sons, bringing 
four Kinney firefighters together on one shift. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be out of here in a short time," said station Capt. John Kinney, 
who plans to retire next year. "We wanted to do this before that happens." 
</P>
<P>
John Kinney, 58, and brother Emmett, 56, a captain at Fire Station 9 in the 
Florence area, left the construction trades and got started in what has become 
a family business back in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
"Our dad's brother was the district fire chief in Indianapolis for 36 years," 
John Kinney said, sitting down to a massive breakfast of fried eggs, potatoes, 
sausage and English muffins while his nephews toiled over the station house 
griddle. "Emmett and I have practically worked our whole careers in and around 
this area. I made captain in '69. Butch, when did you make it, '67?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sixty-six" Emmett Kinney answered. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers moved to southwest Los Angeles as young children. Their father, 
who operated knitting machines and made women's hosiery, left Indianapolis when 
strikebreakers defeated his efforts to organize garment workers, Emmett Kinney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working-class people, but that's changing," he said, explaining that his 
youngest son will enter Pepperdine Law School in the fall and his daughter is 
an opera singer in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
None of John Kinney's children chose firefighting as a career, but Emmett's two 
other children followed their father and uncle into the County Fire Department. 
Joe, 27, joined seven years ago, and usually works in Huntington Park. Kevin, 
26, signed on in 1985 and works out of East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
While the Kinneys all work within a few miles of one another, their homes are 
scattered all over Southern California: John lives in Mission Viejo, Emmett in 
Camarillo, Joe in Ontario and Kevin in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Both Joe and Kevin say they won't push the next generation of Kinneys to follow 
in the family tradition. But they won't try to dissuade them either. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came into this, I had high expectations -- I always thought my dad had 
a great job," Kevin Kinney said. "And the job has exceeded my expectations. You 
never know day-to-day what you'll be doing."

DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS RAISE POLICE ALARM

<P>
Police on Sunday said they are alarmed by three apparently unrelated drive-by 
shootings over the weekend in the city, which could indicate an increase in 
gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the three incidents, which occurred Friday night, 
Saturday night and early Sunday morning, but two vehicles were damaged by 
gunfire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two men were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Tom Broderson said the three incidents occurred near what are 
thought to be gang territories. 
</P>
<P>
The two men who were arrested remain in Orange County Jail on $10,000 bail each 
in connection with a 10:40 p.m. Friday incident in which four suspects in a 
vehicle shot at a passing car on Janice Street. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Coronado Mesa, 20, of Santa Ana and Pablo Aguilar Rivera, 18, of Garden 
Grove were arrested on suspicion of shooting at an inhabited vehicle and 
assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, which occurred shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday, a man 
narrowly escaped injury when four shots were fired into the windshield of his 
pickup truck as he took cover under the dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
Broderson said that shooting took place after three people in a car drove up to 
a large group standing in front of a home on Homer Street and asked where they 
were from. 
</P>
<P>
When no one answered, one of the three pulled a gun from under the hood of the 
car, firing it at the driver of a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's incident occurred at 3:40 a.m. on Starsia Street when a group of 
people in a car drove by a home with a few people in the front yard, firing 
several shots at a car parked in front of the house. WENDY PAULSON

Laboratory researcher Ronald Schusterman signals "small ball fetch." This is 
old hat for Rocky, a teen-age female California sea lion that has been working 
with Schusterman for more than five years. The sleek marine mammal reliably 
retrieves the small ball -- ignoring the large ball, the small bat and the 
black Clorox bottle, also afloat in her tank -- and brings it directly to the 
rubber-booted psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
But then Schusterman tries a new experiment: He removes the small ball, leaves 
the large ball in the tank, and replaces it with an even larger ball. Again he 
signals Rocky, "small ball fetch." 
</P>
<P>
Rocky begins to search the tank. Her dog-like head swivels, her liquid eyes 
scan the water's surface. She circles. She even searches underwater. No doubt 
about it: The original small ball is not there. Finally, she appears to reach a 
decision about Schusterman's odd request: She brings him the smaller of the two 
balls -- the ball that, only minutes before, had been the larger one. 
</P>
<P>
Schusterman considers this an exciting finding. It demonstrates that not only 
does Rocky understand the concept of "small," she also understands it in both 
absolute and relative terms. And, he points out, "This kind of classification 
and categorization is very crucial in the acquisition of language." 
</P>
<P>
In studies here and in Honolulu, psychologists working with marine mammals are 
documenting complex, language-like abilities in animals that have never been so 
convincingly demonstrated before. 
</P>
<P>
Today, in a radical departure from the bulk of previous language work with 
apes, these researchers are concentrating on probing the animals' language 
comprehension, rather than focusing on use of language. And by probing anew the 
fundamental nature of language, learning and thinking, they are discovering 
that humans and marine mammals appear to share remarkable similarities in the 
ways that they gather, assimilate and make decisions about the information in 
their world. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're living at a high point in terms of the study of these phenomena 
in animals," Schusterman says. "I think (the observations) enable us to see a 
powerful connection between ourselves and other animals." Perhaps, he ventures, 
most of the cognitive abilities necessary for the comprehension of language are 
already present in most mammals and birds, contrary to current belief. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and '70s, great apes were the stars of animal language 
experiments. Koko, a female lowland gorilla, was tutored in American Sign 
Language. Her trainer, Penny Patterson, claimed the gorilla used this language 
to swear, joke, lie and even rhyme. Washoe, a female chimpanzee, used sign 
language to communicate her perceptions. Raised among humans, when she first 
saw another chimp and was asked what it was, she signed "black bug." A 
language-trained chimp named Lucy used known signs to create novel combinations 
to describe new objects: She called a watermelon a "candy-drink," citrus fruits 
"smell fruits." The first time she bit into a radish, she named it "hurt-cry 
food." 
</P>
<P>
But these experiments were heavily criticized, and many were abandoned under 
fire. As funding disappeared and the powerful animals grew unmanageable, many 
of the apes ended up in zoos and medical laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
While at times the apes seemed to have clearly understood what they were 
saying, often the humans could not. Critics pointed out that the apes often 
created mere "word salads." The apes could produce words, but how much did they 
understand about what they were saying? Could they process sentences using the 
grammatical features of a language? 
</P>
<P>
By focusing instead on animals' understanding of language, the new studies can 
more carefully examine the thought processes and abilities that underlie 
language. It was difficult to understand what Koko was thinking when she signed 
"Please milk please me like drink apple bottle." But "if you issue a request 
and the animal carries it out," points out psychologist Lou Herman, "you can 
reasonably conclude that the animal understood it." 
</P>
<P>
Child-language researchers have long believed that the ability to understand 
language and the ability to produce it evolve in the child as separate systems, 
which are later integrated. (In fact, the two systems seem to be controlled by 
separate areas of the brain, as is indicated by the experience of certain 
stroke victims. Some, depending on the area of the brain affected, can 
understand language but not speak it; others can speak it but cannot understand 
it.) 
</P>
<P>
In learning language, comprehension normally precedes and exceeds production. 
Working primarily with language comprehension provides a window into the 
language-like capabilities in which the animals are more likely to excel. 
</P>
<P>
As director of Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Laboratory in Honolulu, Herman was a 
pioneer of this approach. Many scientists agree that Herman has given new 
scientific credibility to the field of animal language experiments. 
</P>
<P>
For his work with dolphins, Herman devised two "dolphinized" artificial 
languages. One, created for Phoenix, a teen-age female, was an acoustic 
language that referred to objects, actions and modifiers with 
computer-generated whistles played underwater. The other, created for another 
female, Akeakamai (whose Hawaiian name means "lover of wisdom"), was composed 
of hand and arm gestures that the dolphin viewed in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Language, Herman points out, is more than just the mental ability to pair 
symbols with their referents. There must also be syntactic rules -- grammar -- 
to govern how the symbols are used and to dictate their meaning within a 
sentence. Semantics and syntax are the core attributes by which linguists 
define human language, separating language from other forms of communication. 
These features allow us to generate infinite meanings from a finite vocabulary 
-- an ability long believed to be the Rubicon separating man from animals. 
</P>
<P>
In both of Herman's languages, the object word always precedes the action word. 
Modifiers always precede the object modified. In addition, Phoenix was taught a 
straightforward grammar for the position of direct and indirect objects of a 
sentence: "Surfboard, take to Frisbee." Akeakamai was taught an inverse 
grammar: "To Frisbee, surfboard take." 
</P>
<P>
With these rules and a vocabulary of about 50 "words," Herman has discovered 
that the dolphins will carry out the commands conveyed in literally thousands 
of sentences. It is clear from the dolphins' performance, he says, that they 
understand the difference between the request "To left Frisbee, right surfboard 
take," and "To right surfboard, left Frisbee take" -- even though the two 
commands are made up of identical words. 
</P>
<P>
Schusterman, who has obtained the same results with seals and sea lions, says 
this "tells us the animal is very sensitive to sequence. And we know that 
sequence is one of the important kinds of abilities in language." This shows an 
ability that was obscured in the ape language experiments, which focused on 
production. For instance, to request an orange, the chimp Nim would typically 
signal a grammarless string of words: "Give orange me give eat orange me eat 
orange give me eat orange give me you." 
</P>
<P>
Schusterman says he is not ready to call what his animals are doing "language." 
But then he admits that dolphins, sea lions and seals "might not consider what 
we do swimming, until we can swim out 40 miles and stay under for 10 minutes." 
Herman is more confident. Although he stresses that the animals have not 
demonstrated the language comprehension abilities of even a young child, he 
concludes that "dolphins do take account of both the semantic and syntactic 
components of the sentences they receive when organizing a response." 
</P>
<P>
Importantly, when known signals are combined in novel ways, the dolphins almost 
always understand them the very first time -- an achievement so complex that 
linguist Noam Chomsky dubbed this, in humans, a "mysterious ability," central 
to language. 
</P>
<P>
The animals spontaneously generalize meanings of symbols to apply beyond the 
contexts in which they were first taught. For instance, when Rocky was taught 
the symbol for "black," she could apply the concept of "blackness" to all the 
black items floating in her tank, and tell them apart from items that were 
white or gray. 
</P>
<P>
Schusterman has found that the seals and sea lions, like Herman's 
larger-brained dolphins, are adept at processing symbols, whether they see them 
or hear them. Sprouts, a 2-year-old male harbor seal at the Santa Cruz lab, is 
now carrying out directions presented through "mixed media": synthesized sounds 
signify objects, and hand signals represent actions. 
</P>
<P>
And Herman's dolphins have proved so talented at recognizing and processing 
symbols that they will even correctly carry out gestural instructions signaled 
to them on a television screen viewed from an underwater window in their tank. 
They can understand the symbols even when the image is degraded to show only 
two moving points of light where the trainer's white-gloved hands would be. In 
fact, Herman has found that the dolphins understand these symbols as well or 
better than do all but the most expert trainers -- they vastly outperform 
novice trainers and Earthwatch volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Other work by Herman shows that dolphins are able to correctly report whether 
an object named by a trainer is present in the dolphin's tank. The dolphin 
responds by pressing one of two paddles to signal presence or absence. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies by Herman and research associate Palmer Morel-Samuels show that 
the dolphin brain appears to be similar to the human brain, in that complex 
instructions are processed faster by the left hemisphere, and simpler 
instructions by the right. Says Morel-Samuels: "Whatever the nature of this 
hemispheric specialization, it suggests that in the processing of information, 
humans and dolphins may be more alike than some people . . . believe."

COUNTY FAIR ATTENDANCE SETS RECORD

<P>
By the time the gates of the 98th annual Orange County Fair closed for the last 
time at midnight Sunday, more than half a million people had walked through 
them, setting an overall attendance record that will be one for the books. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be hard to follow," said fair sponsorship coordinator Diane 
Sorensen. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, 56,222 had attended this year's closing day, pushing to 600,784 the 
number of people who had taken part in some of the fair's festivities, 
including the animal petting farm, pie-eating contests and carnival rides. 
</P>
<P>
Last year 544,816 people attended the 12-day fair. Final figures for this 
year's event won't be available until today. 
</P>
<P>
Through the cacophony of carnival ride music, laughter and hucksters' taunts, a 
few celebrities shone. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say the star of this year's Fair was Shortcake, the fair's mascot 
pig who was on display with her new piglets. Ask any one of the hundreds of 
children begging parents for money to play one more game, however, and they 
will tell you the star of the fair was either Bart Simpson or the Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, it's been the Ninja Turtles," said 21-year-old Peter Matrisciano, 
who has been painting the reptiles' expressions on youngsters' faces for the 
last 12 days. "Last year, it was Batman and the Joker." Matrisciano has been 
face painting at the fair for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Scharf from Fullerton brought her 4-year-old son Alan to the 
face-painting booth and Alan chose the Turtle face. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe he's sitting still through this," Scharf said. "He loves the 
Ninja Turtles. He's always got to have a weapon and he goes around saying 
'Cowabunga.' " 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters dragged their money-carrying parents to booths that promised a 
chance to win a life-size stuffed Turtle or Simpson doll. 
</P>
<P>
At Blackbeard's Ladder, their eyes were glued on the life-size prizes as they 
tried to climb up a ladder suspended by a rope. Most fell off and landed on the 
soft air cushion below, having fun for their dollar but looking discouraged 
because the dolls were out of reach. Only eight players had completed the climb 
since the fair opened July 11. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all balance," said the man who ran the booth Sunday. "It takes about two 
hours to learn." 
</P>
<P>
Fair attendance has consistently increased each year. 
</P>
<P>
"We always try to add stuff to the fair but I think we had a lot of good 
incentives for people this year," Sorensen said, explaining several time- and 
money-saving tips for fair-goers, including a weekday discounted admission 
price, a parking-fee waiver for car pools -- of which 40,000 cars took 
advantage -- and a shuttle service to lessen traffic. LUCY CHABOT

POLICE RAID 2 HOMES AND ARREST 5 PEOPLE

<TEXT>
<P>
A team of 20 police officers raided two homes over the weekend, arresting five 
people on a variety of charges, including possession of cocaine for sale and 
possession of stolen property, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The raids, which began at 8:15 p.m. Friday, were in a north San Clemente 
neighborhood that police said has been the scene of several disturbances over 
the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"A team of 20 officers served a search warrant on an apartment . . . where 
undercover officers had bought cocaine and marijuana while doing an 
investigation of criminal activity in the neighborhood," Sgt. Richard E. 
Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested for possession of half an ounce of cocaine was Mario Hurtato, 25, who 
lives at the apartment in the 100 block of West Escalones. Also arrested at the 
scene for outstanding misdemeanor warrants were Lorenzo Hurtato, 20, and 
Francisco Cazares, 30, Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
One hour later, police went to a home on the 800 block of Calle Puente, behind 
West Escalones, and arrested two men on suspicion of having stolen property, 
believed to have been taken from a local dentist's office two weeks earlier, 
Downing said. Joel Gonzales, 18, and Juan Nejorado, 20, both of San Clemente, 
remain in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Brian J. Rice said the arrests indicate the city's proactive stance 
on stomping out minor criminal activities before they escalate. 
</P>
<P>
"Sending 20 officers out there makes a statement that the city is going to 
accentuate that area," Rice said. "We have not had anything of a tremendous 
concern happen, but the same problems keep cropping up in the same area, so the 
city is coming from a very proactive angle to prevent things from getting out 
of hand." WENDY PAULSON

HARBOR DREDGED TO ENSURE SAFE BOATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The tall crane that has dominated the skyline in Dana Point Harbor will 
continue dredging through the first week in August, county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The crane with the "clamshell" bucket on its arm has been removing sand from 
several shallow spots, said Larry Paul, manager of coastal facilities for the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the seven-week project is about $437,000, Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
Periodic dredging is necessary for the safety of about 3,000 recreational and 
commercial boats that use the 20-year-old harbor, Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
"We constantly monitor the harbor bottom until we get an accumulation 
sufficient to justify the cost of a project like this," Paul said. "It's not an 
exact science. But we don't want to have a low tide and a keel stuck in a 
shoal." 
</P>
<P>
Over time, silt from storm drains and sand that has sifted through the 
breakwaters build up in certain areas of the 20-foot deep harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys revealed the need for dredging at the entrance to the east 
harbor basin as well as at the fishing dock and fuel dock areas, Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the buildup occurred on the west side of the outermost breakwater, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before work begins, a sample of materials from various points on the harbor's 
bottom is taken and sent to labs for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what we have there is sand and clay and silty material," Paul said. 
"But we go through six or seven regulatory agencies before the material is 
disposed of." 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the project, about 40,000 cubic yards of this material 
will be lifted from the bottom, deposited on a neighboring barge and then 
shipped to an approved dump site 12 miles off Newport Beach, Paul said. LEN

City Councilman Gene A. Leyton has announced that he will not run for 
reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
Leyton, 64, told his colleagues that he wants to spend more time with his wife 
and family. 
</P>
<P>
He has had major surgery twice in the past two years, but he assured the 
council that his health is fine. 
</P>
<P>
The longtime Brea resident was appointed to the council to fill the vacancy 
left by the death of Sam Cooper in 1985. He has been active in the community 
for many years, serving three years as director of the Brea Foundation and six 
years as parks, recreation and human services commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Leyton's five years on the council have been a time of change for Brea. The 
city is in the midst of a major redevelopment project that included tearing 
down the old high school and building a new one and widening State College 
Boulevard and Lambert Street. 
</P>
<P>
"This term was one of the busiest and one of the most productive," Leyton said.

Every cloud has a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomers from Australia and the United States said last week that they plan 
to build a large telescope atop an icy plateau near the South Pole, in part 
because the ozone hole over that continent would allow better viewing of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantages are great," said astronomer John Storey of the University of 
New South Wales. "The atmosphere (there) is very stable and very thin, and star 
images are very sharp. There are long periods of darkness during which 
astronomers could study stars." 
</P>
<P>
And, for at least three months of the year, from October through December, the 
stratosphere over Antarctica contains as little as half the normal amount of 
ultraviolet light-absorbing ozone -- a fact that would facilitate observing the 
universe in wavelengths that are normally obscured by the Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The ozone hole is caused by man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, 
which are used as refrigerants and solvents. When sunlight returns to the 
Antarctic after the long polar winter, it triggers a massive destruction of 
ozone by the chemicals.

Progesterone suppositories, the most common treatment for premenstrual syndrome 
(PMS), are not significantly effective for the condition that afflicts up to 7 
million American women, University of Pennsylvania researchers said last week 
in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers studied 168 women who reported various PMS symptoms, including 
irritability, mood swings and breast tenderness -- the largest such study ever 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Women in the 1988 study received vaginal suppositories containing progesterone 
for two months, followed or preceded by two months of treatment with a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent of the 121 women studied reported at least a 50% decrease in 
PMS symptoms. But because all the women had received both progesterone and a 
placebo, researchers said the improvement could not be attributed to the 
hormone.

British astronomers said last week that they had found 13 massive star-eating 
objects at the edge of the universe -- objects so powerful they consume the 
equivalent of a billion stars a year. 
</P>
<P>
The objects, known as quasars, are believed to be black holes formed by failed 
galaxies collapsing into themselves in the early stages of the universe's 
development, astronomer Michael Irwin told a meeting of the International 
Astronomical Union in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"We think quasars are galaxies that formed, but for some reason produced a big 
black hole in the middle that sucked in all the material and started emitting 
radiation," said Irwin. One such black hole is believed to inhabit the center 
of our galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
The newly discovered quasars are so far away it takes their light more than 13 
billion years to reach Earth. Consequently, they provide a window into what the 
universe looked like just one billion years after it was created 14 billion 
years ago.

<P>
Heart attack survivors can dramatically reduce the risk of death, stroke or a 
second heart attack by taking the powerful anti-clotting drug warfarin, 
Norwegian physicians reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
In a study involving 1,214 volunteers, researchers at Ulleval University 
Hospital in Oslo found that subjects given warfarin instead of a placebo for at 
least two years suffered 24% fewer deaths, 34% fewer heart attacks and 55% 
fewer strokes. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits to heart attack sufferers may in fact be even greater than the 
team concluded because some of the subjects in the warfarin group stopped 
taking the drug and then died or suffered a second stroke or heart attack. When 
the research team considered only those volunteers who were taking the 
medicine, the death rate was actually 35% lower, the heart attack rate 43% 
lower and the incidence of strokes 61% lower. 
</P>
<P>
The study "furnishes strong evidence that therapy with warfarin reduces the 
risk of death" and subsequent heart attack, the researchers said, and the drug 
"can be recommended" for patients who have survived an initial heart attack.

DEMAND FORCING HOMELESS SHELTERS TO TURN AWAY MANY POOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When a homeless woman and her two children wandered into the Neighborhood 
Housing Services office in Santa Ana recently, director Douglas Bystry tried to 
place them in 10 different shelters -- all with no success. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so frustrating," said Bystry, a La Habra councilman and homeless 
advocate. "There were no beds available." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say that's not surprising. As Orange County's needy population and the 
demand for social services skyrocketed in the past year, so has the demand for 
shelter. And while Neighborhood Housing Services, a private, nonprofit agency 
that provides home improvement loans to low- and moderate-income families, is 
not set up to help homeless people, those that are find they cannot help many 
of those in need. 
</P>
<P>
At the Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter in Costa Mesa, the 20 beds available on 
an emergency basis are usually claimed by 10 a.m. The Shelter for the Homeless 
in Westminster, which offers transitional housing for up to four months in nine 
locations, gets 10 times more requests for beds than it can accommodate, its 
director estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone calls to the 27 shelters on a list provided by the Homeless Issues 
Task Force this month produced nothing but a few vacant beds for troubled 
youths, some answering machines and instructions to call back in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has a next-to-impossible time finding help," said Susan Oakson, 
coordinator of the task force, noting that there are an estimated 10,000 
homeless people in Orange County and only about 600 beds. 
</P>
<P>
Billie Shinde, 29, knows firsthand about the shortage of beds. 
</P>
<P>
Shinde came to Orange County late last month with her husband, her brother and 
her two children, the younger just 6 months old, after being evicted from an 
apartment in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived in Orange County a couple years ago. I was happy here. I loved it here 
and wanted to come back," said Shinde, who worked as a data-entry operator 
until she had the last child. So they gathered their belongings, boarded a 
Greyhound bus and headed north. 
</P>
<P>
After using up their $2,000 savings on motel rooms, they landed at the Orange 
Coast Interfaith Shelter in Costa Mesa, where they were told they could stay 
for three days. 
</P>
<P>
The family made its way from agency to agency in search of a place to stay 
until it could get on its feet. The results were not too promising. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been out every day from 8 to 4 and haven't gotten anything but a bag of 
groceries, some damn bus tokens and a lot of 'I'm sorrys,' " Shinde said as the 
family prepared for dinner recently on its final night in the Costa Mesa 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Late the next afternoon, they still had no place to go and Shinde was dipping 
into her last dollars to make final, desperate calls from a public telephone in 
front of a grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we'll just find a patch of grass somewhere to sleep," said Billie's 
husband, Vicral, 23. 
</P>
<P>
The ordeal of finding a bed can be the most difficult for families and single 
women, some shelter administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
"There seem to be less shelter beds for women, especially women with children," 
said Jim Palmer, a consultant with the Christian Outreach Rescue Mission in 
Santa Ana, which has 65 beds for men and eight for women. "We've seen a 
dramatic increase in the number of women and children asking for help in the 
last three years." 
</P>
<P>
Social service agencies like Episcopal Service Alliance, which provides food, 
clothing and other assistance in addition to shelter, estimate the demand for 
service has gone up as much as 40% in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
Many shelters say it's difficult to quantify the increased demand because so 
many callers are told there's no room. "Shelters are usually so busy that it's 
very difficult to keep records," Oakson said. "And once you're full, you can't 
get any fuller. I don't know of any shelters that haven't turned people away 
and aren't turning people away every day." 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates say the skyrocketing price of housing, combined with few 
jobs, has pushed some people over the edge into homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen a real increase in the last year. Go to the downtown of any city 
and you'll see more and more homeless, more and more poverty, more and more 
desperation," said Larry Haynes, director of Mercy House, a long-term 
transitional housing program for men in Santa Ana. "It's not so much that we 
have more people moving into Orange County. What we're finding is that more 
people here are finding themselves homeless." 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the Homeless Issue Task Force found that 41% of the homeless 
have lived in the county for 10 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
And contrary to popular belief, summer can be a difficult time for many of the 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time of year when the money doesn't come in as much," said Dennis 
White, executive director of the Episcopal Service Alliance, which relies on 
private donations as well as government funding. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if they think about the homeless, people think they don't have to fight 
the cold and things like that in the summer. And a lot of people are on 
vacations. At this time of year, we always see a decrease in funding, but this 
year because of the increase in numbers, we're feeling it more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to this trend, the United Way of Orange County has donated $25,000 
to kick off a campaign to raise $1 million for struggling shelter and food 
providers in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, to be launched Monday, is also seeking donations of 500,000 
pounds of food and 1,000 volunteers for local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that once the Orange County community understands how desperate the 
needs are, they will be motivated to act," said Oakson, one of the campaign's 
organizers.

SKINNER TAKES PRIDE IN TAKING ADVANTAGE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AS BACKUP TO ALL-STAR SANDY ALOMAR JR., CLEVELAND'S RESERVE CATCHER 
LOOKS TO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Joel Skinner's strategy at the plate seems to be a simple one: Ignore a 
pitcher's past glories, forget his notoriety and never consider him unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy's got a ball in his hand and you try to hit it," said Skinner, a backup 
catcher for the Cleveland Indians. "You take pride in what you're doing, that's 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner had reason to be proud Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in place of Sandy Alomar Jr., Cleveland's All-Star catcher who was 
sidelined by a sprained left thumb, Skinner had a double off starter Mark 
Langston, a three-run home run off reliever Willie Fraser and scored twice to 
help the Indians defeat the Angels, 8-1, at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
His homer to left, his first of the season, came on a 3-2 pitch in the third 
inning. It gave Indians a 7-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point in time, I was just trying to work myself back in the count," 
said Skinner, who was playing in only his 25th game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to make contact. . . . Striking out has always been a thorn 
in my side. My ratio is not all that good." 
</P>
<P>
Going into Sunday's game, Skinner, a former standout at Mission Bay High School 
in San Diego, had struck out 24 times in 66 at-bats. The last time the Indians 
met the Angels in Cleveland, July 1-2, Skinner struck out four times in five 
at-bats, but also received a bases-loaded walk. 
</P>
<P>
The last time he faced Langston, on May 30 at Anaheim, Skinner drove in two 
runs with a single in a 4-2 Cleveland victory. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner shrugged when asked about his success against Langston, whose record 
fell to 4-12 with the loss Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a tough pitcher over my career," said Skinner, 29, and a six-year 
veteran of the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have much luck against him when he was in Seattle. I think coming 
into this year, I only had one or two hits against him." 
</P>
<P>
But Skinner was sharp Sunday. After Felix Fermin grounded to third to lead off 
the second inning, Skinner hit a breaking ball down the left-field line for a 
double. He scored on Jerry Browne's single to give Cleveland a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Skinner also played a part in an impressive outing by starter Greg 
Swindell, who improved to 6-5 after giving up six hits and one run in eight 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He did real well," Swindell said of his catcher. "I think with him and Sandy, 
we have two of the best catchers in the league. I tend to know him better than 
I know Sandy anyway, so it was nothing (to pitch to him). I never had to shake 
him off once." 
</P>
<P>
Skinner said it was just a matter of making the most of his opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"You just try to contribute," he said. "You can't go out and play for yourself 
-- that's a key part of being professional. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing people don't realize is that it's a lot of fun to play. And when you 
get to, you make the most of it so you can keep playing."

SPENCE KICKS IN TO HOLD OFF MUSYOKI AND WIN IN COURSE-RECORD TIME; 
</P>
<P>
FIESTA 5,000: HIS FINISH IN 13 MINUTES 58.9 SECONDS BREAKS PADILLA'S MARK OF 
14:22. MOSQUEDA WINS WOMEN'S RACE.

It came down to the kick for Steve Spence, who had enough to hold off William 
Musyoki and win the men's five-kilometer race Sunday in the Fiesta 5,000 
World-Class Invitational road race in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Spence, who is ranked second among U.S. road racers, finished in a 
course-record time of 13 minutes 58.9 seconds and picked up $3,000 prize money. 
The previous record of 14:22 was set by Doug Padilla in last year's inaugural 
Fiesta 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Musyoki, a native of Kenya who lives in Van Nuys, was second in 13:59.4 and 
received $2,000. Matt Guisto, who was a four-time All-American at the 
University of Arizona, was awarded $1,000 for his third-place finish (14:00.9). 
</P>
<P>
Spence, who lives in Chambersburg, Pa., but spends his summers training in 
Boulder, Colo., made a rare Southern California appearance Sunday, and for a 
while it looked as if Spence would make only that: an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
After staying near the front through the first mile, Spence faded to sixth as 
the lead pack pulled away. Spence said later that he felt stale at the race's 
beginning because he had hurt his right Achilles' tendon on a training run July 
14 and wasn't able to begin training until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Spence, 28, made his way back to the front and was even with Musyoki and 
Guisto, both 23, as the runners made a sharp turn around a set of cones 200 
meters from the finish. With 175 meters remaining, Spence surged into the lead. 
Musyoki, who June 15 won the Bastille Day 8K in Newport Beach, sprinted after 
Spence and made up some ground before finishing five meters shy at the finish. 
"The pace was a little slow at the beginning, but I threw in some surges at 
1,000 meters," Spence said. "And at the mile mark, the pack sort of ate me up. 
I got a little excited, but then I decided to let the other people do the 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Spence, who won the NCAA Division II track and field 5,000 meter titles for 
Shippensburg College (Pa.) in 1984 and '85 before turning his attention to road 
racing, said he ran in the Boston Marathon in April and prefers longer 
distances. He has been concentrating on shorter races to prepare for Saturday's 
Bix 7-mile in Davenport, Iowa. The race is expected to draw many top runners. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing a lot of speed for a 5K," Spence said. "Usually, I have to 
sacrifice the shorter race (that I run). But I'm pleased with my kick today -- 
I had my spot picked out where I wanted to surge and I went right by that and 
let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
Musyoki said he misjudged the location of the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, in a way, I thought the finish was a little further, but I give the 
winner credit," he said. "When he went in front, it was too late to catch him. 
But I don't want to use that as an excuse. He won the race." 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Mosqueda of Alhambra won the women's race in 15:55, defeating Sue Lee of 
Vancouver, British Columbia (15:59), and breaking Lisa Weidenbach's course 
record of 16:00. Belgium runner Ria Van Landeghem was third (16:04). 
</P>
<P>
Mosqueda, 24, who won the women's division of the recent Bastille Day 8K, led 
from the start Sunday. Lee, who finished eighth in the 10,000 meters for Canada 
in the 1988 Olympics at Seoul, said she never really found her rhythm Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I found today harder than I expected because I've been doing a lot of running 
on the track and not the roads," said Lee, 30. "The course was challenging 
because of the hills, but I never felt that I was in a smooth rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
Mosqueda said she used the Bastille Day and Fiesta races as tune-ups for this 
week's Goodwill Games in Seattle, where she will participate in the 
10,000-meters race. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson Waigwa, 41, a 1984 Olympian from Kenya who resides in El Paso, Tex., 
broke his world masters best for a 5K (14:23), winning in 14:16.8. Laurie 
Binder of Oakland won the women's masters race in 17:25.0, and Ngaire Drake of 
New Zealand (17:41) finished second.

NEWPORT BEACH DUKES END TRIP BY FALLING TO THE STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport Beach Dukes won only one set and lost to the New Jersey Stars, 
26-16, Sunday in a Team Tennis match at Florham Park, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes (5-2) took a lead in the first set of the match, when Amy Frazier and 
Sophie Amiach defeated Billie Jean King and Linda Harvey-Wild, 6-2, in women's 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
The Stars (2-5) rallied first behind Harvey-Wild, who defeated Frazier, 6-5 
(5-3 in the tiebreaker). 
</P>
<P>
Frazier had not lost a set in six previous singles matches. John Sullivan and 
Shane Barr then beat Marty Davis and Roger Smith, 6-3, in men's doubles to tie 
the score at 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
It was the only loss of the Dukes' five-match Eastern trip, but Coach Greg 
Patton was disappointed it didn't end more successfully. "We can't afford to 
lose to the weaker teams," Patton said. "That team was 1-5, but they caught us 
at the right time."

ANN CONWAY: A FLOWERED PATH INTO WEDDED LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ann Conway 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture it: a lily-and-rose blanketed gazebo perched on a grassy cliff 
overlooking a pounding turquoise sea. 
</P>
<P>
Now, picture trumpeters in black tie proclaiming the arrival of a bride so 
majestically turned out that wedding guests suck in their breaths. Her white 
lace gown glitters with a gold beaded bodice. Her bouquet -- a waterfall of 
bridal white roses, lilies of the valley and Casablanca lilies -- sparkles with 
more gold beads. 
</P>
<P>
As she inches toward the gazebo, her Cinderella pumps never touch the lawn. 
Why? Because, along with gussying up the Ritz-Carlton gazebo and gold-flecking 
her bouquet, a florist has stripped 1,000 white roses of their petals to create 
a path upon which Peggy O'Neil-Milhous will sweep into wedded life with Charles 
Rohrer. 
</P>
<P>
Sound like something out of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"? Perhaps. But 
it's business-as-usual for Paul Ecke. His Black Iris in Laguna Beach is Orange 
County's hottest hothouse. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, Ecke created the floral arrangements that graced the oval table 
upon which four U.S. Presidents did lunch at the Nixon library. When President 
Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald R. Ford, and Richard M. Nixon and their wives sank 
their teeth into Dover sole with lemon butter sauce, they did so beside three 
Ecke bouquets: first, the centerpiece, a spray of yellow roses -- a favorite of 
Pat Nixon's -- interspersed with Sterling Silver roses, Queen Anne's lace and 
freesia; and then, two smaller satellite bouquets, floral bookends for the main 
masterpiece. Ecke also did the library's entry bouquet. And, he provided the 
white orchids that glamorized the facility's four guest bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Also last week, Ecke created the birthday bouquet sent to Harriet Nelson by her 
son, David. It was a spring basket loaded with flowers -- lilies, roses, 
tulips, freesias -- and one perfect gardenia, he says. "David's bouquets to his 
mother always include one gardenia." 
</P>
<P>
Ecke also dreams up arrangements for Laguna Beach resident Bette Midler. "She 
likes them stylized, but not too far out," Ecke says. Ditto O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Taylor likes them romantic. Ecke did arrangements for La Liz when she 
vacationed last year at the Ritz-Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are developer-clients like Donald Bren, Donald Koll, David Stein, 
Barry Brief, and Jim and Al Baldwin. And, on occasion, William Lyon. Ecke has 
also done the popular Orangewood Ball for Kathryn Thompson. Not to mention the 
Christmas wreaths that Nixon sends to his good friends, developer Donald 
Bendetti and his wife, Dorothy. 
</P>
<P>
Or the posies that regularly spruce up the waterfront manse of Western Digital 
chairman Roger Johnson and his wife, Janice. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the Dallas mega-millionaire whose name Ecke doesn't want to see 
in print. (The prominent Texan's daughter will marry in Orange County this 
fall. Rumors are flying that the Bushes may attend.) 
</P>
<P>
In a monetary way, things haven't always come up roses for Ecke, a high-energy 
guy who disarms you with his Colgate smile. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, he was an art director for schools in the Irvine and Anaheim areas. He 
loved his job. But there were those "summers off," as he calls them. 
</P>
<P>
He needed odd jobs to make ends meet. "I did some abstract painting," he says. 
"But it wasn't enough." When a fellow faculty member asked him to create 
something special, decorate a table for a party at one of the schools -- "Come 
on, you're an artist -- you do great bulletin boards!" he told Ecke -- Ecke 
decided to give it a try. And he ended up doing several more. "I created a look 
women liked. Then I began doing parties, weddings, benefits. Things really took 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Ecke's floral "look" came at a time when hostesses and brides were getting 
burned out on traditional arrangements, he says. "They were tired of the same 
old carnations, roses and mums." So he gave them drama -- exotic concoctions 
using ginger, anthurium, orchids and angular foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ecke specializes in the tropical and the traditional. For the recent 
Milhous-Rohrer nuptials, Ecke not only flooded the gazebo with flowers and 
topiary trees, he surrounded the towering wedding cake -- embellished with 
edible 24-karat gold -- with 14 marbleized pillars topped with explosions of 
white blooms. He also provided the white liquid-silk coverlets that camouflaged 
every ballroom and garden chair. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion's centerpieces stood atop three-foot acrylic pedestals. "The 
magnitude of the flowers for that wedding just blew my mind," Ecke says. (Ecke 
used a grammar school room to accommodate the blooms he ordered for Peggy 
Milhous. His shop wasn't big enough.) "It was absolutely the most elegant 
wedding I have ever seen," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For Orange County's ultimate power lunch Thursday at the Nixon library, the 
trick was to have the roses opened "just enough" when the Presidents sat down 
to dine, Ecke says. "We made the arrangement on Tuesday to get it to the 
library on Wednesday because security was so tight we couldn't go into the 
library on Thursday," he says, catching his breath. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the flowers out of the cooler for eight hours to start them opening. 
Then we put them back to stop them from opening. At the library, they were kept 
in an air-conditioned room until lunch so they would be absolutely perfect." 
</P>
<P>
They were. Now that's flower power.

ACOUSTIC ALCHEMY FALLS SHORT OF MAGIC AT COACH HOUSE SHOW 
</P>

<P>
What's in a name? Plenty, when the group is the instrumental outfit Acoustic 
Alchemy that appeared Friday at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to figure how the word "acoustic" got into the title. Led by British 
acoustic guitarists Nick Webb and Greg Carmichael (Webb plays steel strings, 
Carmichael plays nylon -- makes it easy to tell them apart), the band anchors 
its sound on the clean tones and warm interplay the men produce from their 
instruments. It's their mix of personal styles that suggests the word 
"alchemy." 
</P>
<P>
But there's more to it than that. With backing from keyboardist Terry Disley, 
who manned a rack of synthesizers; electric bassist Klaus Sperber; Chilean 
percussionist Mario Argandona and rock-steady drummer Bert Smaak, the group's 
sound forged old and new, as well as a number of ethnic influences, into its 
acoustic-electric blend. 
</P>
<P>
"Alchemy" also suggests magic, the mysterious search for a way to turn common 
materials into gold. But despite the chemistry between Webb and Carmichael, the 
magic was missing, and there were few glittering moments in the program of 
mostly original material taken from the group's latest recording, "Reference 
Point," to be released in early August. 
</P>
<P>
The opening number, "Homecoming," began with a duet of the guitarists that 
pretty much defined their roles for the evening, with Carmichael taking the 
bulk of the solo responsibilities while Webb provided rhythmic impetus. The 
tune, via a dramatic chorus break, segued into "Casino," with Carmichael taking 
a Spanish-flavored improvisation above keyboardist Disley's chiming 
accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Webb took the lead on "Chinese Takeaway," with Disley creating koto-like 
effects and percussionist Argandona adding Asian touches on blocks and bells. 
Like most of the improvisations heard during the show, this one was short and 
to the point, favoring melodic simplicity over flashy displays of technique. 
</P>
<P>
A lazy, reggae-influenced version of Paul Desmond's "Take Five" (made popular 
in the '50s by Desmond's boss Dave Brubeck) featured a strong beat from drummer 
Smaak and was a vast improvement from the tepid, almost lullaby-paced version 
that appears on the forthcoming album. Disley pulled a string effect from his 
synthesizer to re-create Brubeck's well-known chordal background. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights from the evening included Webb's "Caravan of Dreams," a relaxed 
tribute to the forward-looking performance center located in Fort Worth, and a 
jam to "Sweet Georgia Brown" that, with a minimum of backing, gave the 
guitarists a chance to shine. Also providing needed diversity was the rambling, 
on-the-road rhythms of "Overnight Sleep" and the thoughtful "Ariane," a 
showcase for Webb, from their earlier "Blue Chip" album. 
</P>
<P>
But as the evening progressed, variety of this sort was in short supply and it 
wasn't long before much of the material began to sound alike. 
</P>
<P>
Carmichael's unaccompanied encore showed what he was capable of, but it's too 
bad it came so late in the show. The group needs to open up the rhythmic 
diversity of its music and allow Webb and Carmichael to do more improvising, 
something that would help avoid the contrived sound of each solo. Acoustic 
Alchemy seems to have all the right ingredients. Now they just need to inject 
some magic. 
</P>
<P>
Show opener Linda Roth, backed by a five-piece band, put her pleasant, 
middle-register voice to good use on original R&amp;B-influenced pop material 
and ballads. What Roth's ensemble lacked in rhythmic tightness was more than 
made up for by the enthusiasm of its members.

National Orchestra, under the direction by Neeme Jarvi, chorale officials 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The trip, underwritten by Eesti Kontsert, the Estonian state concert 
organization, will begin on June 22, 1991 and end July 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific will join with the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir for a

2 OF TRIATHLON'S TOP 3 FINISHERS ARE DISQUALIFIED; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: NINE PROFESSIONAL COMPETITORS IN ALL WERE ELIMINATED FOR SWERVING OFF A 
NARROW BICYCLE COURSE TO AVOID HITTING SLOWER COMPETITORS. 
</P>

<P>
The Oxnard Triathlon stumbled in its first lunge into big-time sports events 
Sunday when two of the top three finishers were disqualified for veering off a 
narrow bicycle course to avoid crashing into slower contestants. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the eighth annual event heavily promoted the $10,000 in prize 
money that lured more than 700 amateurs and two dozen top professional 
triathletes to compete in a combined 1.5-kilometer swim, 40-kilometer bicycle 
ride and eight-kilometer run. 
</P>
<P>
But the event ended on a sour note as top competitors complained about an 
unsafe bicycle course with a awkward mix of fast-paced pros and slower 
amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't feel like a win," said Brad Kearns, who was moved up to first place 
after judges disqualified Miles Stewart of Australia and eight other 
professional competitors. "A lot of pros were disqualified for something they 
didn't have any control over. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time Oxnard had a field with a lot of pros," Kearns said. "The 
course was unsafe and it wasn't good for them to ride on. It is too bad for the 
people who organized this." 
</P>
<P>
Race director Rob Fukutomi acknowledged that the bike course was too narrow for 
so many contestants. "But they were warned ahead of time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the cycling leg of the event, bike riders were restricted to the bike 
lanes of a loop running along Harbor Boulevard, Olivas Park Drive, Victoria 
Avenue and 5th Street. The problem arose when faster professional triathletes 
tried to pass slower amateurs on their second lap of the course. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing about this race is that the bike course was much too narrow," 
said Stewart, 19, who was disqualified for swerving out of the bike path marked 
by orange cones. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are going twice as fast as others and if they swerve in front of us 
we'll knock them down if we even touch them," Stewart said. "We have to trust 
our judgment and go around them instead of getting into an accident." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Zugmaier, an official with the Triathlon Federation USA, said judges had 
no choice but to penalize those who broke the rules by departing from the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people out there who were trying to obey," Zugmaier said. "Some of 
them fell back and went slower because they couldn't pass the other riders. It 
wouldn't be fair if we just ignored the rules after the race." 
</P>
<P>
But Kearns, who benefited from the disqualifications, disagreed. "When it's 
dangerous to follow a rule, that shouldn't be a rule," Kearns said. Several 
racers, including Mike Montgomery, 34, a professional triathlete who was 
disqualified, said they would not be returning to Oxnard's event because of 
problems with the course. 
</P>
<P>
Fukutomi agreed that the success of future Oxnard Triathlons depends on what 
happens with the bicycle course. Organizers will be faced with designing a new 
course or widening the present one, he said. But both present problems of 
adding to traffic congestion in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Or maybe this just won't be a pro race anymore so we don't have the same 
problems we did this year," Fukutomi said. "But I don't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
For the past eight years, organizers have been trying to develop the race into 
a premier event that would draw top athletes. For the first time, sponsors Bud 
Light, Sizzler Restaurants and Pepsi put up $10,000 in prize money to attract 
athletes from as far away as New York and Connecticut, as well as a few 
international competitors. 
</P>
<P>
When the triathlon first began, "It was like Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney 
saying 'Hey, let's put a show on in the barn,' " said Laura Mosqueda, assistant 
race director. "We didn't really know what to do, but we just wanted to see if 
we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the event has become a prestigious race with one of the largest 
purses of state triathlons. On Sunday, the top competitors and wide field of 
amateurs drew about 2,000 spectators to the park at Oxnard State Beach. An 
additional 500 fans lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the bicyclists and 
runners. 
</P>
<P>
Although some professional triathletes complained about the bicycle course, 
other pros and amateurs seemed to enjoy the three-leg event that began with a 7 
a.m. swim in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Newby-Fraser of Encinitas, who took first place in the women's division 
for the fourth time in a row, said she was delighted to compete in the event. 
She said she considers it "one of the top one or two in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
For Lisa Laiti of Leucadia, who came in second in the women's division, the 
event marked her continued determination to disprove doctors' predictions that 
she would never fully recover from two serious accidents. "But you can't listen 
to the negative thoughts of other people," she said. "You have to listen to 
what your body tells you and to what you believe." 
</P>
<P>
In the men's division, Scott Tinley of Del Mar finished second behind Kearns. 
Garrett McCarthy of Redondo Beach came in third. 
</P>
<P>
Coming in last was Gordon Gooding, a 59-year-old Shadow Hills man with 12 
grandchildren. Although he completed the race in less than three hours, he said 
he had thoughts of quitting. "There was no one there at the back with me and it 
gets kind of boring that way," he said. "But once I start something, I like to 
finish it."

EATERIES' FOUNDER REMEMBERS WHEN PIZZA WAS PIZZA

Red is in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
It's 90 degrees at 10 a.m. -- and climbing fast. The restaurant parking lot is 
steaming. The humidity is buttermilk thick. 
</P>
<P>
And Red, the floppy-eared Doberman watchdog, has just gotten a cool soaking 
from the garden hose held by his owner, a stout old man with a white handlebar 
mustache who's now sweating more than his dog. 
</P>
<P>
"Christ, it's hot out here," says George Pernicano, 72, bathed in sweat. "Let's 
go inside. It's cooler in there. Red, you go lay down in the shade." The dog, 
who is not stupid, complies. 
</P>
<P>
Inside is not much cooler, but it's home -- a sprawling, boarded-up labyrinth 
of fuzzy red walls, tons of mementos and the echoes of a million satisfied 
stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
In the heart of Hillcrest's rejuvenated business district sits the closed-up 
Pernicano's/Casa di Baffi, a 25,000-square-foot gold mine of real estate that 
has prospective developers drooling. 
</P>
<P>
Pernicano has had the site -- bordered by 5th, 6th, University and Robinson 
avenues -- up for sale since mid-1988. He says he closed the restaurant -- at 
least to the public -- because the liquor board told him it had to be open at 
least five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"That's bull----," he says with gusto. "But I didn't want to hassle with them." 
</P>
<P>
Pernicano, the patriarch of an Italian restaurant empire in San Diego, decided 
that 44 years of cooking what many describe as the finest Italian food in 
Southern California was enough. 
</P>
<P>
He had made plenty of people happy -- as well as plenty of money -- so he 
closed the joint. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, there's always football. Pernicano is as eager as a little boy for the 
season to start. He purchased 5% of the San Diego Chargers in 1961 -- he still 
owns 3% -- and hasn't missed a game since. He's an unabashed fan, still 
visiting the field and the front offices, supplying home-cooked food to the 
players and staff. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his former customers remember the restaurant fondly. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the in place to go for years," said Pat Rogers, a secretary with the 
Chargers. "The food was excellent, and it was a fun place to go." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Teele, assistant to the Chargers' president, added: "In the old days, it 
was a must to go to Pernicano's. There was George and Belle (his wife), and the 
food and service. It was just a hell of a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Pernicano, who loves his race horses, cigars and the Chargers as much as 
fine Italian food, spends his time entertaining offers to buy the restaurant 
property, but he doesn't seem to be in much hurry to sell. 
</P>
<P>
He lives in the small, beat-up office in the restaurant's parking lot during 
the week -- "Who the hell wants to fight that traffic?" -- and spends the 
weekends with his wife at their ranch in Santee, or visiting his two sons and 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Pernicano served his cooking apprenticeship in his hometown of Detroit after 
World War II, and he still does some cooking when friends and family 
occasionally stop by the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
For decades it had the reputation of being San Diego's premiere Italian eatery. 
Today it looks deserted from the street. It sits dark and empty -- except for 
the proud old paisano and his dog. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got my health and my family. What more can a man want?" he says, smiling. 
He pats his stomach. The trademark mustache -- at its longest 14 inches and 
insured for $50,000 with Lloyd's of London -- twitches a little. Casa di Baffi 
means House of the Mustache in Italian. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is cavernous: big dining rooms, kitchens, hallways, banquet 
rooms, storerooms, all with high ceilings. Piled everywhere are old newspapers, 
trophies, photographs, magazines, papers, skillets, antique cash registers and 
other stuff. 
</P>
<P>
On request, Pernicano, a natural storyteller, launches into a series of tales: 
how he left Detroit in 1946 to bring pizza to San Diego, how he brought his 10 
brothers here to create a family restaurant empire, how everybody from 
professional athletes to Hollywood's beautiful people to San Diego's working 
stiffs flocked to Pernicano's for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The stories have been reported in countless magazine, newspaper and TV articles 
and are well-known to longtime San Diegans. Pernicano tells them with gusto and 
pride. 
</P>
<P>
His 10 brothers have retired, and his sons carry on the family tradition. Garry 
owns a place in El Cajon. Larry has one in Scripps Ranch and next month will 
open another in the Uptown District, not far from his father's original 
restaurant in Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing that irritates Pernicano these days is contemporary pizza 
chains, lousy cooking and unwholesome ingredients. His face turns red just 
thinking about it. He begins talking with his hands, the fingers pinched 
together in the old Italian way. 
</P>
<P>
"Ahhh, that commercial ----," he says. "Christ, that isn't pizza. Piling all 
that goddamn phony cheese in the middle. I wouldn't let my dog eat that plastic 
----. The secret is the crust and sauce. I guess I'm just a fussy old son of a 
-----." 
</P>
<P>
He ends his culinary critique -- brief but pointed -- by waving his hands as if 
trying to brush away the mere thought of today's chain pizza parlors. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on. I'll show you around the place," he says, heading into the shadowed 
interior of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen smells of olive oil, black pepper, garlic, handmade dough, 
garden-grown vegetables and fine meats. Old pizza ovens, cheese grinders, dough 
mixers stand unused. 
</P>
<P>
In one dining room is a jukebox -- offering Nat King Cole, Glenn Miller, Herb 
Alpert and their contemporaries -- and a 40-foot, 1940s-era bar that 
Pernicano's customers carried on their shoulders across the street when he 
changed locations in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Old menus show the Pernicano clan in a montage of black-and-white photos taken 
over the years. In many, George is wearing a chef's hat and dancing on the 
tables, bars and counters. Customers are smiling all around. He seems to have 
done a lot of dancing then. He smiles now. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he says a little wistfully. "Things were different then. There was more 
fun. People had a lot more fun. And, with all the taxes and government 
regulations, all the fun's gone out of the family business." 
</P>
<P>
He heads down to the spacious basement. The lights blink on. It is dank and 
cool. Piles of papers, menus, cups and equipment are stacked high. He looks 
around. Hundreds of people once ate, drank, sang and laughed here. It was long 
ago, but you can see it in his eyes: It might as well have been yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
"You dumb dago," he mumbles to himself. "I've got to get this stuff in order." 
</P>
<P>
He says it like a man who has been saying the same thing for years, who knows 
it will never get done, but says it aloud anyway once in a while to ease his 
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at these," he says, picking up some black objects the size of footstools: 
cheese, aged 40 years, rolled in olive oil and black pepper decades ago. Also, 
slabs of cured ham hanging on hooks. Old ABC beer. In the wine cellar, bottles 
of Italian wine, about 30 years old. He gingerly handles a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
"Cradle that like the baby Jesus," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He moves through the blackened passageways leading to his basement offices. 
More piles of papers, mementoes, Chargers game balls. He has not been down here 
lately. Memories are jumping up and slapping him in the face. He opens a 
beat-up cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"What the hell . . . " His voice trails off. 
</P>
<P>
He finds a wrapped cigar -- expensive cigars and the handlebar mustache were 
his trademarks -- and an old Charger jersey, No. 19, ALWORTH across the back. 
</P>
<P>
"Bambi," he says, using Hall of Famer Lance Alworth's nickname. "I'll be a son 
of a -----. Will you look at that?" 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't seen some of this stuff in years, and you can tell he is drifting 
away in memories, standing there in the basement with his old cheeses and wine 
and photographs of himself with famous athletes and actors and "my ballplayers" 
-- Alworth, Ron Mix, John Hadl and others. 
</P>
<P>
He's looking at his life, and it's all a little yellowed and rough on the 
edges, but he doesn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"So much stuff," he says. "So much ----." 
</P>
<P>
Later, upstairs, he makes lunch: pork slices, fresh tomatoes, cooked spinach, 
Italian bread. Plenty of garlic, black pepper, olive oil, vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
"Eat, eat," he says happily. 
</P>
<P>
It's something he's been saying all his life.

LATINO STUDENTS GIVEN BOOST TOWARD COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
FOUNDATION: FINANCIAL AID AND MORAL SUPPORT IS PROVIDED LATINO STUDENTS BY A 
FOUNDATION THAT HOPES RECIPIENTS WILL SOME DAY AID THE COMMUNITY.

Keven Lippert will be the first person from his family ever to go to college, 
and when he leaves for his first year at UC Berkeley he will take with him 
moral and financial support beyond that of his family. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a $500-a-year scholarship for as long as he remains in college and 
the encouragement of his "mentor," Lippert is one of 105 students who will have 
an extra boost toward successfully completing their college careers because of 
the Beca Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody in my family has been to college before, and now I'll have someone to 
go to with questions. More important than the money is the support," said 
Lippert, who graduated from Rancho Buena Vista High School in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting the scholarship gives me more support when I need it, especially the 
mentor," said Lippert, referring to Beca's program matching students with 
Latino graduates who help guide them through college's trials and tribulations. 
</P>
<P>
And Lippert hopes that, by getting through college, he will be able to act as a 
role model for his 13-year-old sister, Jennifer, when she reaches college age. 
</P>
<P>
A businesslike approach to fund raising has been the trademark of the San 
Marcos-based Beca Foundation, the largest and fastest-growing Latino 
scholarship organization in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The North County organization, established five years ago by a group of Latino 
business leaders, this year increased fourfold the amount of scholarship money 
it awarded to Latino students, bestowing $115,000 in scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
That's twice as much as the second-largest such organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We reorganized, made a business plan and a commitment to open an office and 
hire an executive director. We made an effort to (seek) grants, find corporate 
sponsors, set up a data base and get the word out," said Jon Frandell, a member 
of the foundation's executive board and a vice president of Inland Empire 
National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting the word out" resulted in the foundation's largest single donation, 
from Edward and Mary Currivan, who pledged $300,000 last month as part of the 
Alice Newell Joslyn Fund. The $300,000 will be distributed to Beca over several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"It served our need and desire for a long time," said Edward Currivan, who had 
considered opening a school for nurses in San Diego. "We've been wanting to 
help the Latinos, and we also feel that there is a great need for them in the 
field of nursing." 
</P>
<P>
Currivan, whose wife, Mary, is the daughter of Alice Newell Joslyn, said he was 
referred to the Beca Foundation by chance during a conversation with the maitre 
d'hotel of a Carlsbad restaurant while having dinner there. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the foundation was not primarily geared toward helping students 
interested in medical careers, but now, because of the Currivans' donation, 
more than half the students who benefit from the organization are pursuing 
medical careers. 
</P>
<P>
Well represented among the foundation's 40 corporate sponsors are high-tech 
firms, such as Hewlett-Packard, Unisys and Hughes Aircraft, as well as local 
financial institutions such as First National Bank and Escondido National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation hopes to address the growing Latino high school dropout rate and 
to try to steer more students into college. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, 18% of the population in San Diego is Hispanic, and, in 10 years, 
40% to 50% of the student population will be Hispanic," Frandell said. "About 
45% drop out of high school, of those (who) graduate, only 22% make it to 
college, and only 7% of those graduate." 
</P>
<P>
Beca, Spanish for "scholarship," began five years ago when it supported 10 
students. Last year, the group gave out 28 scholarships totaling $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Most students receiving scholarships, which are based on both need and academic 
performance, are from North County. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate goal is to try and reach Hispanic students who are at the 
elementary school age to begin to get them thinking on setting their sights on 
something higher than blue-collar jobs and to provide them the opportunity to 
shoot for college as opposed to limiting themselves," said David Ronquillo, one 
of Beca's founders and an attorney based in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Although Beca's success is universally admired among Latino fund-raisers, some 
feel that Beca's success should be the norm rather than the exception. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Pascual Martinez of the Assn. of Mexican-American Educators 
attempted to begin an umbrella scholarship foundation made up of San Diego 
Latino professional organizations, as opposed to an independent scholarship 
organization, but the effort fell flat. 
</P>
<P>
"I really found it disturbing that we had our little turf fights," said 
Martinez, whose own organization gave out more than $8,000 in scholarships this 
year. "Everybody wanted the spotlight, and I would have to say that that was 
one of my biggest frustrations." 
</P>
<P>
"We have rivalries among ourselves that are not necessary if we would only 
focus on the needs of the students," said Martinez, director of the child 
development program at San Diego city schools. 
</P>
<P>
Beca and the San Diego-based Alba 80 Society, the only other Latino scholarship 
organization in the county that distributes more than $50,000 a year in 
scholarships, have informally divided the county into two. 
</P>
<P>
"They respect the fact that Alba is in San Diego doing a lot of fine work, and 
we respect the fact that Beca is in North County," said Alba 80 president and 
founder Martha Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old independent scholarship organization distributed awards to 43 
students this year, Contreras said, and has expanded its list of activities 
since its inception to include self-esteem programs for junior-high students 
and an ambassador program, in which college students visit high schools and 
junior highs to act as role models for those interested in higher education. 
</P>
<P>
Alba 80's corporate sponsors include General Foods, Coca-Cola and Big Bear 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Beca's scholarships too come with more than just money, including support from 
the Latino professional community in the form of mentors. Every scholarship 
recipient is matched with a mentor to help guide them through college. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a mentor is a really great experience," said Ed Payan, a Beca mentor for 
a freshman at UCLA and a chemical engineer with Hughes Aircraft in Carlsbad. 
"It lets me share with a student some of the experiences I had when I was in 
college, and the mistakes I made." 
</P>
<P>
"The original concept was that a lot of kids didn't make it to college because 
of two things: (lack of) financial support and moral support and 
encouragement," Frandell said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we try to do with the mentor program is say, 'I care that you graduate,' 
and the kids internalize it," said Frandell, attributing the fact that none of 
the foundation's scholarship recipients have dropped out of college to the 
mentor program. 
</P>
<P>
Beca bases its scholarships on both the students' academic performance in high 
school and their financial need. Students compete for the scholarships after 
submitting applications, which include letters of recommendation and an essay 
on "how your family has influenced you and what if any special attributes you 
would like to pass on to your child." 
</P>
<P>
One of the requisites for receiving one of the $500- to $2,000-a-year 
scholarships is a willingness to put back resources into the Latino community, 
as the members of Beca have been doing as mentors. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main questions in the interview is, 'What are you going to give 
back to the community?' "' Frandell said. "Some of the students interviewed 
were very qualified, but when asked why they want to go to college, it was 
basically because they wanted to drive a Porsche." 
</P>
<P>
Beca representatives also go to high schools to emphasize the importance of 
high school and college, and the organization now hopes to begin programs to 
educate Latino parents on how the educational system works by establishing 
workshops and publishing pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
"The educational system in Mexico works very differently than here in the 
U.S.," Frandell said. "You have to teach (Latino parents) how the educational 
system works, how to go up and meet the teachers and principals, and the basic 
skills of getting involved. Many studies show that, if you look at the 
high-achieving students and go home, you find involved parents."

ENDANGERED TERNS STARTING TO THRIVE AT ORMOND BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: JOY OVER THE LEAST TERN'S RE-EMERGENCE, HOWEVER, IS ACCOMPANIED BY 
SADNESS OVER THE LOSS OF A COLONY AT POINT MUGU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Least terns are making a comeback in Oxnard, but nature has driven the state's 
largest colony of the endangered birds from Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
At Oxnard's Ormond Beach, the birds have overcome the problems of pests, people 
and three-wheeled motorbikes, producing 15 healthy chicks since May. 
</P>
<P>
It's a notable achievement for the birds, which are an endangered species. For 
years, five pairs that lived at Ormond Beach saw their nests destroyed by 
people, other birds, varmints and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
This year a larger colony of the feisty terns has driven away intruders, and 
stepped-up police patrols have held down damage by illegal three-wheelers. 
</P>
<P>
Happiness about the comeback, however, has been offset by disappointment over 
the loss of the colony at Point Mugu, just to the southeast. Biologists say 
some of the Ormond birds may be refugees from Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
At Point Mugu, the Navy kept the public away from the terns' nesting area. Last 
summer, more than 100 pairs nested there. 
</P>
<P>
But in May, as young terns found their lifetime mates and began to settle onto 
the sand to lay eggs, a storm sent waves crashing over the beach. It crushed 
eggs and washed out nests. Predators ate the remaining eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the storm, the adult birds abandoned the colony, said Grace Smith, a 
Point Mugu Navy biologist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so sad," she said. "This year we have none." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the birds will probably return next year, biologists say. 
</P>
<P>
The least terns are the smallest of the North American terns. White with black 
masks, they have nine-inch bodies and a 20-inch wingspan. Their high-pitched 
call is more like a loud squeak than a song. It changes to a strong 
"kick-kick-kick-kick" when they are alarmed. They feed on marine life. 
</P>
<P>
The birds winter in South America and return to Southern California in April to 
mate, nest and form colonies. Both male and female protect the nest, taking 
turns at mealtime. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the young emerge, the wobbly chicks make their way out of the 
shallow nests to protected areas behind dunes. Their parents support them for 
another five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The colonies are frequently invaded by gulls that blunder through or come 
looking for eggs. They are greeted by dive-bombing terns, which deposit splats 
of white waste on their heads. 
</P>
<P>
The birds once numbered in the thousands, with nests from San Francisco to San 
Diego. As development encroached on beaches, least terns statewide dwindled to 
about 300 pairs by the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Now their status as an endangered species provides some protection of habitat. 
The state population has grown to about 1,000 pairs, U. S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service biologist Martin Kinney said from his office in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
A similar subspecies exists along the Mississippi River and on the East Coast, 
but the California least terns are the only ones of their particular subspecies 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the development in Southern California, once a colony is destroyed, 
there is no new habitat being created," Kinney said. "The remaining colonies 
have to be protected if we're ever going to get the bird to a level where it 
can recover." 
</P>
<P>
Kinney said that's hard, with only 15 wildlife officers from Ventura to the 
Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Scott Johnston, whose area 
stretches from Pismo Beach to Ventura, agreed and complimented citizen 
advocates of the birds. 
</P>
<P>
"I need all the help I can get," Johnston said. "The local help has been 
absolutely critical to recovering the birds here." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-tern groups include the Audubon Society, which has helped 25 pairs survive 
at the mouth of the Santa Clara River at McGrath State Beach in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
They also include the Ormond Beach Observers, headed by Roma Armbrust of 
Oxnard. She said she began asking authorities to intervene in behalf of the 
birds after off-road vehicles destroyed nests at Ormond Beach on July 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'So what?,' " she said of the birds' survival. "But the least tern 
is just the tip of the iceberg of our ecosystem. We are in a sense turning our 
backs on ourselves, because we can't survive where other species can't 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
At Ormond Beach, authorities say, warning signs should help preserve eggs 
through the nesting season, which lasts through August. 
</P>
<P>
Posts and tape surrounding the one-acre colony seem to be keeping the surfers 
and people away, Johnston said. But the terns have little defense against 
unleashed dogs or off-road vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the 1% of people who don't know about the birds who can destroy a 
whole colony," Johnston said. "It's not intentional. It's just ignorance, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
Some people, however, wonder whether the city really wants what's best for the 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the police are patrolling," said Al Sanders, who lives nearby. "But there 
is still access to the beach, and that seems to be common knowledge to the 
off-road vehicle riders. It also seems to be common knowledge when the 
patrolling takes place." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Kinney, redevelopment director for the city, said Oxnard's financial 
troubles, which have already forced the Police Department to cut back patrols 
citywide, limit the time the police can devote to Ormond Beach, which is one of 
the city's redevelopment areas. 
</P>
<P>
"When there is difficulty providing enough officers to fight crime, I would 
have trouble providing round-the-clock protection for the terns," Kinney said. 
He said, however, that the city would consider staggering the days and hours 
that the beach is patrolled. 
</P>
<P>
Kinney said the city has shown a commitment to saving the colony. 
</P>
<P>
"We have recently gone from never having spent any money to protect the least 
terns to spending tens of thousands in the last six months," he said, referring 
to police patrols and new gates to reduce vehicular beach access. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders voiced suspicion of city endorsement of a plan to build a marina and 
housing development at Ormond Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many people who wonder if the city has an unofficial policy to allow 
the birds to be run out of there," Sanders said. "Everybody knows the city 
wants to develop down there." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, by the Baldwin Co., has been scaled back from 10,000 to 5,000 homes, 
and a proposed marina has been dropped, Kinney said. The absence of an 
endangered species at the beach could remove an obstacle to development, but 
Oxnard's agenda is clearly in favor of the birds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the city's plans, Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Johnston 
said, the law requires protection of the terns. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way they could go through with it," Johnston said of any unspoken 
plan to drive the birds away. "The Endangered Species Act is extremely clear 
that there can't be any destruction of habitat. They will have to have formal 
consultations with us before any development."

Leo Medina, 21, was taken into custody about 4:45 p.m. outside his home in the 
300 block of B Street, Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Kathy Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said Medina began arguing with Steve Segovia, 26, of Fillmore over a 
former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The argument became heated and Medina brandished a 9-millimeter semiautomatic 
handgun, Kemp said, adding that he threatened to shoot Segovia and his brother, 
Jessie, 26.

UNITED WAY GIVES OUT $3.75 MILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
An AIDS information and referral service and a literacy program are among 64 
health and human services agencies that will receive $3.75 million next year 
from United Way of Ventura County, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies were selected by a panel of 150 volunteers who spent nine months 
screening applications, said Alex Jestrab, associate executive director of 
United Way. 
</P>
<P>
Laubach Literacy, an Oxnard-based literacy program, and AIDS Care, an 
information and referral service, will each receive $14,000 from United Way, he 
said. It was the first time that the agencies had applied for United Way funds. 
</P>
<P>
Two other organizations that had previously received funding -- Community 
Service Organization of Ventura County and Travelers Aid Assn. of America -- 
did not seek funds this year, Jestrab said. 
</P>
<P>
The 64 agencies funded this year provide a range of services, including 
counseling, youth development, health care, child-abuse intervention and 
prevention, domestic violence shelters, and drug- and alcohol-abuse programs. 
</P>
<P>
The largest allocation of $361,500 went to the American Red Cross of Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Those funds will be used to support the agency's counseling services and will 
provide aid to local disaster victims, Jestrab said. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for funding, agencies must be established at least two years, have 
broad community support and nonprofit status, Jestrab said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 64 agencies received $3.5 million from United Way. CAROLYN KUSKY

CITY WEIGHS FUNDING FOR VISITORS BUREAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday will consider three options to provide 
financial support for the Convention and Visitors Bureau to prevent it from 
being closed. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Manager David Mora had recommended several months ago that the city 
eliminate its $398,000 contribution to the bureau as a way to reduce a 
projected $2.8-million deficit in the 1990-91 budget. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the City Council voted to contribute half of the amount to keep the 
bureau open until December. 
</P>
<P>
The action was intended to give the city time to identify new ways to pay the 
salaries of the bureau's six full-time staff members without draining the 
city's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Varley, executive chairman of the bureau, had warned the City Council 
that closing the bureau would have a devastating effect on the tax revenues 
generated for the city by hotels, motels and other tourism-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
One of the options that the council will consider is formation of an assessment 
district of motels, hotels and other businesses that benefit from the bureau's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Another option would be to require hotels and motels to pay a visitors' fee, 
which would not to exceed the cost of the services provided by the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
A third option is to ask the city's voters to approve a 2% increase in the 
transient occupancy tax, which is charged on all hotel and motel rooms in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The tax increase would require approval of a majority of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the City Council decides to earmark the tax revenues to finance the 
bureau's activities, adoption would require approval of two-thirds of the 
voters. HUGO MARTIN

COUNTY URGED TO CREATE LAND TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County should consider starting a "land trust" that would pay property 
owners to preserve greenbelts, agricultural areas and other open spaces, 
Supervisor Maggie Erickson has suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said she will urge fellow board members Tuesday to take steps toward 
forming a commission to explore how to pay owners for withholding their land 
from development. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point I'm not sure how the money would be raised," she said. "One 
source that comes to mind is the California Coastal Conservancy," a state 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Under Erickson's proposal, county planners would designate properties that are 
worth preserving as greenbelts and other open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"The planners might decide that a particular greenbelt is so valuable they're 
willing to pay to preserve it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the property owners would be compensated for not developing the land, 
Erickson said. Erickson said the idea is an offshoot of the Beyond the Year 
2000 Advisory Committee, whose status report will be submitted to the 
supervisors Tuesday. Erickson was a member of that panel. 
</P>
<P>
"The Year 2000 Committee felt open spaces were one of the most important issues 
facing the county," the supervisor said. "Land trusts have solved such problems 
elsewhere in the country. Perhaps it could be done here." 
</P>

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATTENDANCE HIGH AT GROUNDED AIR SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 80,000 people attended the final day of Aviation Expo '90 Sunday at Van 
Nuys Airport, despite the absence of any daredevil stunts or aerial displays, 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
"For an exposition without any flying, it went very well," said Acting Airport 
Manager Richard Davison, adding that he hopes Sunday's high turnout will help 
prevent the demise of the annual event. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Department of Airports commissioners voted in April to make this 
the last air show at the airport, which has hosted the event for 28 years. 
Commissioners also decided to ground planes this year in response to concerns 
from residents in the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But that did not deter aviation buffs, about 5,000 of whom lingered on the 
tarmac Sunday afternoon to watch the takeoffs of the 90 or so aircraft that had 
been displayed. Davison said crowds continued to watch planes take off at 7 
p.m., two hours after the show was scheduled to end. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to see flying," he said.

2 PLEAS FOR PICKWICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have watched, with sadness, the lack of interest by Pickwick owners and 
managers in maintaining this world-known gathering place of some of the most 
famous names in skating. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of tearing it down, why not correct the problem? Bring in people who 
know how to make this training center profitable and are willing to work at it. 
</P>
<P>
Think about the hundreds of young people who will be deprived of their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Must our figure skaters, hockey players, speed skaters, ice dancers, pair 
skaters, recreational skaters, show skaters, precision skaters and future 
Olympians be penalized? 
</P>
<P>
Is there anything more exciting than seeing "our kids" standing on the podium 
under that fantastic American flag at the Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
Please, don't close Pickwick!

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE BURNS 20 ACRES IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire suspected to be arson blackened about 20 acres of brush in the Santa 
Clarita Valley Sunday, but firefighters contained the blaze before it reached 
several nearby homes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of injuries and no residents were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Two teen-agers were detained by sheriff's deputies shortly after the fire near 
San Fernando Road and Valle del Oro was reported at about 4:45 p.m., said 
Assistant Chief Leon Provost of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old from North Hollywood and a 15-year-old from Lancaster were 
released to the custody of their parents, said Los Angeles County Sheriff Sgt. 
Michael Watner. 
</P>
<P>
Provost said the teen-agers, whose names were not released because of their 
age, were seen leaving the site where the fire broke out behind Shady Mobile 
Home Park. 
</P>
<P>
Several large houses in Placerita Canyon were threatened by the flames, but 
about 235 firefighters had contained the fire by 6 p.m. Provost said about 100 
firefighters would remain until late Sunday night to extinguish hot spots.

HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS FORM FEDERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of a dozen San Fernando Valley homeowners associations announced Sunday 
that they have banded together as a federation to fight overdevelopment and 
sponsor workshops on how to fight City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
During a news conference on the steps of Van Nuys City Hall, the group of about 
15 neighborhood activists accused city officials of ignoring homeowners' 
concerns and pledged to educate the public about the building-approval process 
in town-hall-style seminars. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Gross of Sunland-Tujunga, president of the new San Fernando Valley 
Federation, said some Valley residents are so frustrated with traffic and crime 
that they have suggested that the Valley incorporate as its own city. 
</P>
<P>
Such a campaign is not currently on the group's agenda, Gross said, but "unless 
some corrective measure is taken by the planning department, this could lead to 
that effort." 
</P>
<P>
The new federation includes homeowners associations from Sunland-Tujunga in the 
east to Encino in the west, mainly on the Valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ireland of the Reseda Community Assn. said the federation would teach 
residents about state environmental laws and the planning process to make them 
better watchdogs. 
</P>
<P>
No seminars have been scheduled yet. 
</P>
<P>
The group criticized Councilman Hal Bernson for reportedly challenging the 
number of residents active in homeowners associations. But despite repeated 
questions from reporters, no one representing the new federation would provide 
the number of dues-paying members in its affiliated associations.

S.D. OFFICER UNHURT IN SHOOTING INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Passengers in a pickup truck fired at least five shots from a small caliber 
weapon at a police supervisor in an unmarked police car early Sunday at Chicano 
Park in South San Diego, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two or three people in a Nissan pickup truck fired at the officer, who was in 
the park to investigate an earlier shooting, Sgt. Fred England said. Neither 
the officer nor his passenger, a dispatcher, were injured in the gunfire that 
occurred at 3:47 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup truck was later found at 17th and J streets, its interior burned, 
England said. Police are still investigating. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unusual to have an undercover unit shot at," England said.

LANGSTON HEARS ANAHEIM CHORUS; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: FANS' PATIENCE RUNS THIN AFTER HE GIVES UP SIX RUNS IN 2 2/3 INNINGS IN 
8-1 LOSS TO INDIANS. WINLESS STREAK REACHES SEVEN WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Langston lost again Sunday, and this time he lost sympathy as well as the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Close scores have dogged Langston during his search for a fifth victory, now in 
its seventh week. In his last two starts before Sunday, he lost despite 
pitching complete games, yielding two runs in one, three in the other. Each 
time, he got only one run from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't let them thwart him again. 
</P>
<P>
This time he did himself in, lasting only 2 2/3 innings in the Angels' 8-1 loss 
to Cleveland. He was charged with six runs, the final two scoring on Joel 
Skinner's three-run homer off relief pitcher Willie Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always believed in (Langston) and supported him, and I will continue to 
believe in and support him," Manager Doug Rader said. "I don't think there's 
any question he will turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
Langston has lost seven consecutive decisions, falling to 4-12. He has not won 
since June 5. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians scored twice in the first inning on Candy Maldonado's single to 
center field. After a single to Chris James put runners at first and third, 
pitching coach Marcel Lachemann made his first visit to the mound, only five 
batters into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"(Langston) just had a rough outing," catcher Lance Parrish said. "Everybody 
has them. It came at an unfortunate time for him because I know he's trying to 
turn things around." 
</P>
<P>
Lachemann came back in the second inning, during which Langston gave up another 
run on Jerry Browne's single. 
</P>
<P>
By Lachemann's third trip, Langston had given up four runs and 10 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Langston left the mound amid booing from some in the crowd of 32,129 in Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was his shortest outing since June 15, 1988, when he was with Seattle and 
lasted only two innings against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody was too hard on him," Parrish said. "I think he has pitched 
well for us for a while. We just hadn't been able to get the win. All of a 
sudden, he has a bad game, and people react like he's been this way all along." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, whose earned-run average rose from 3.57 to 3.89, already had left the 
stadium before postgame interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he's frustrated at this point. It's very understandable," Parrish 
said. "Mark Langston has been for some time one of the best pitchers in the 
American League. This is probably very hard for him, especially since he's on a 
new ballclub and trying to make a good impression." 
</P>
<P>
Langston was acquired in the off-season, signing a $16-million contract for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Rader, Lachemann and Parrish agreed that Langston struggled with his location 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't throwing bad, velocity-wise," Parrish said. "His location was a 
little off. He wasn't able to get his breaking stuff over to make the fastball 
effective. Just a bad day for him." 
</P>
<P>
One irony of Langston's outing was that pitching poorly might not have made a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had scored only 15 runs in his 11 previous losses, only nine by his 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
They scored only one Sunday, fulfilling what has come to seem the Angels' quota 
with Langston on the mound. In seven of his past nine starts, the Angels have 
scored no more than one run, losing four times by 2-1 scores and once by 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
"The game might have been a little different if he held them to two," Parrish 
said. "We might have been able to put something together, you never know. It 
was just unfortunate how it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Langston has not won a game in his past seven decisions over nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent Sunday, Greg Swindell, allowed a run in the first inning when Luis 
Polonia scored on Dave Winfield's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Swindell retired 14 batters in a row, beginning with Lee Stevens on a 
double-play grounder in the first inning and ending with Polonia's single with 
one out in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Swindell (6-5) left after allowing six hits in eight innings, giving way to 
relief ace Doug Jones, who had not pitched in four days and needed the work. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Angels to 12 1/2 games behind Oakland in the American 
League West as they head into a four-game series at Oakland beginning tonight. 
It is series that once was expected to bear heavily on the pennant race, but 
now is important mostly to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this whole road trip and the next home stand is vitally important," 
Rader said. "I think it's our whole season." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels will play 10 road games against divisional rivals Oakland, Seattle 
and Minnesota before returning home to face Oakland, Boston, Baltimore and New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"If things don't go well during this next road trip and home stand, it's going 
to be very disappointing for us," Rader said. "It's vitally important for us to 
get something going right now." 
</P>
<P>
And the same for Langston. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to keep grinding," Lachemann said. "Not just him -- us as a 
ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield was pinch-hit for in the eighth inning, leaving the 
game with a strained right shoulder. His status was reported as day to day. 
Schofield said arm soreness had been bothering him for a few days and described 
it as normal during the course of any season. He will continue taking oral 
anti-inflammatory medication, he said. . . . Update in the great lineup debate: 
Sunday's lineup was identical to the one used Friday, when the Angels defeated 
Cleveland, 9-4, in the opening game of this series. It marked only the second 
time this season Manager Doug Rader has duplicated a lineup. Rader has used 
different lineups in response to the team's numerous injuries and in an attempt 
to handle various other situations, particularly involving the once-overcrowded 
outfield. The other times Rader used identical lineups were April 11 and 14. 
That lineup is one that will not be repeated; it included Claudell Washington, 
since traded to the Yankees.

WELLS' LOSS IS GAIN FOR PIRATES, 11-6; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: CANDIDATE TO BECOME THE CLUB'S FIFTH STARTER CAN'T FIND THE STRIKE 
ZONE. HIS ERA INCREASES TO 7.45.

<P>
Have you ever lost something small but important? Something you had just a 
minute ago? Something that, when discovered missing, causes you to search and 
sweat until you finally threw up your hands? 
</P>
<P>
Then you know what Dodger pitcher Terry Wells felt like Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Before 26,818 at Three Rivers Stadium, he lost the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 Pittsburgh Pirate batters he faced, he walked six, leading to seven runs 
that overcame two Dodger leads and gave the Pirates an 11-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a long day for me, but it was certainly long for the team," said 
Wells, who earlier on this trip got his first major league victory, against St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, it appeared he had conquered a career of wildness. It appeared the 
Dodgers had ended a search for a fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's loss, which dropped Wells to 1-2 while increasing his earned-run 
average to 7.45, both issues remain mysteries. He walked as many in one game as 
he had in his previous three major league games combined. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have no explanation," said Wells, who lasted three innings that seemed 
like three days. "I was just missing all around the strike zone. I have no 
excuse." 
</P>
<P>
He appeared relaxed by three Dodger runs in the first inning off Rick Reed, and 
only walked Jay Bell in that inning. 
</P>
<P>
But Wells started the second inning by walking Barry Bonds. One out later, he 
walked Don Slaught. Then he walked Rafael Belliard to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger bullpen was already up, and worried. 
</P>
<P>
Said reliever Tim Crews: "As soon as he started to struggle with throwing 
strikes, you just knew something bad was going to happen. You just knew it." 
</P>
<P>
After Wells struck out Reed, it happened. Wells' first pitch to Gary Redus was 
launched over the center-field fence with such force, Kirk Gibson could only 
turn and watch. It was the third grand slam of Redus' career. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored twice against Reed in the third on two errors and hustle by 
Juan Samuel, but the 5-4 lead lasted less than 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the third, Wells walked Bobby Bonilla. Then Bonds singled. One 
out later, Slaught walked for the second time to load the bases for Belliard, 
who had driven in one run in 27 previous at-bats this season. 
</P>
<P>
Belliard ripped a two-strike double down the third-base line, clearing the 
bases. Wells threw a breaking ball on the inside half of the plate, where the 
right-handed hitting Belliard could pull the ball against a defense that was 
shifted the other way. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been blowing fastballs by him, and we were playing him to not pull the 
ball, then here comes this breaking ball that he can pull," third baseman Lenny 
Harris said. "We got beat with that one pitch. Right there, the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
"But Wells can still pitch. And I'm sure he learned from his mistake." 
</P>
<P>
He will probably have only one more chance to show what he learned as the 
Dodgers continue their search for a fifth starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
In 12 starts, the candidates have gone 1-7 with a 7.74 ERA. The Dodgers have 
tried John Wetteland, Mike Maddux, Crews and Wells as fifth starters. Crews 
might get another chance if Wells doesn't improve in his next start. 
</P>
<P>
Said Harris: "People say all you need is one or two good pitchers. Not true. 
You need an entire, healthy staff. We have shown that. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're talking like, if the West Division teams come into Los Angeles in 
the next couple of weeks and blow us out, it's over with. Forget it. The season 
is done." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers returned home late Sunday to begin a 10-day stand featuring games 
against the two teams in front of them in the West Division standings, the 
first-place Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's loss turned a possible 7-3 trip into a 6-4 trip and cost the Dodgers a 
rare chance to gain a game on both the Reds and Giants. The Dodgers are 13 1/2 
games out of first and 3 1/2 games behind the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Wade, general manager at Chauncy's bar-restaurant in Pittsburgh, was at 
the front door of the bar when the Dodgers' Alfredo Griffin and Juan Samuel 
allegedly began beating busboy Wilson Sturgeon Jr. at about 2 a.m Saturday 
after the Dodgers' 4-2 loss to the Pirates. Wade said when he arrived on the 
scene, Griffin was punching Sturgeon's head while Sturgeon was bent and 
attempting to cover himself. Wade said he and several bouncers moved the 
players outside as police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"The cops told the two guys, 'I suggest you get out of here," ' said Wade 
Sunday. "Then our busboy came outside all bleeding, and I said to the guys, 
'Who hit my busboy?' Samuel said, 'I hit him, what are you going to do about 
it?' I don't think he or Griffin realized that these were real policeman 
standing there. It was right about then they took them away."' 
</P>
<P>
On the advice of Dodger officials, Griffin and Samuel, charged with simple 
assault, have declined to comment on the incident. A preliminary hearing has 
been scheduled for July 31 at Pittsburgh's City Court. The Dodgers are 
scheduled to play the Cincinnati Reds in Los Angeles that night. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Griffin made his first appearance in the clubhouse since the 
incident. He had a swollen and bloodshot left eye, and did not play for a 
second consecutive day because his vision was blurred by eye medication. He 
said he planned to play today at Dodger Stadium against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger catcher Rick Dempsey said that in the first inning of Tim Belcher's 
one-hit victory over the Pirates Saturday, he heard a loud clicking sound from 
the Pirate dugout every time he would call for a fastball. "It was obvious what 
the Pirates were doing," Dempsey said. "They must have had somebody on a 
monitor, or somewhere, who was stealing my signs." Dempsey said he changed the 
signs after the first inning and didn't hear the sound again. Jim Leyland, 
Pirate manager, scoffed at the charge. "If we were getting something from 
Belcher, I wish we hadn't been telling our hitters about it, because he could 
have beaten us four times this year!" Leyland said. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray hit his 13th home run of the season in the first inning. . . . The 
Dodger bullpen, after giving up only two runs in its previous 21 2/3 innings, 
yielded three runs in five innings. Tim Crews gave up Jay Bell's fourth homer 
and Ray Searage gave up Bell's RBI double and Bobby Bonilla's 20th homer.

Watching Nick Faldo win a golf tournament is like watching fish swim. 
Remarkable in its own way, but pretty boring after a while. 
</P>
<P>
If you're crazy about lag putts, approaches to the fat part of the green, nice, 
safe two-woods off the tee, you'd love the British Open Sunday. If you're into 
monotonous perfection, Nick Faldo is your pin-up. 
</P>
<P>
He's no fun. He's not Seve Ballesteros winning his Open out of the parking lot 
at Lytham. He's not Arnold Palmer, his shirt hanging out, his eyes squinted, 
trying to figure out how to work the ball over two trees and a five-story 
building. He's not Lee Trevino hitting shots that smack the flagstick, 
otherwise they'd go in the Firth of Forth.

He's an offense against nature, if you're a golfer. No one should play the game 
that easily and dully. You should win such tournaments as Opens with massive, 
three-break, 60-foot putts, as Hale Irwin did at Medinah. Or you should hit 
breath-taking two-irons to guarded flags, as Hogan did at Merion, or chip in 
out of hip-high rough, as Watson did at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo won the British Open Sunday like a guy walking the dog. He won it off the 
principal, so to speak, without having to invest more than the interest in his 
game. He's about as exciting as a clerk. 
</P>
<P>
But he "caned the loop," as the Scots say. That is, he went through the series 
of holes, seven through 11, out on the promontory of this land jutting into the 
sea, known as the "loop," without disaster. "Caning" takes its cue from the 
practice of British officers taking their walking sticks to disobedient troops. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo shot a 71 on the final round, if you care for minutiae. Of course he did. 
He sized up what it would take to keep the field at bay. He didn't go for the 
tournament record -- 268, set by Watson in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo doesn't make it interesting. He plays what the gang at Rancho Municipal 
would call "commercial" golf. Just good enough to win. Like a fighter who never 
throws the right, a hitter who shortens up on the bat with two strikes, Nick 
was not about to fall into the trap Arnold Palmer set for himself in 1966 when, 
with a seven-shot lead with nine holes to play, he set about to breaking 
Hogan's Open record and ended up breaking his own heart -- and nearly everyone 
else's. 
</P>
<P>
Nick knew par golf would win him the 119th British Open. It won him the 116th 
British Open, you will recall. Nick could par the Indian Ocean. Color him gray. 
</P>
<P>
But also color him with the Union Jack. It used to be a Brit winning the 
British Open was man-bites-dog stuff. Now, it's the-Pope-is-Catholic stuff. 
</P>
<P>
From the start of the first invasion of Britain by American golfers headed by 
Bobby Jones and company in the mid-'20s to the second invasion by Palmer and 
company in 1962, Yanks seemed to be able to win this tournament any time they 
really cared to. And when they didn't care to, the tournament seemed to be 
given over to other colonialists -- Bobby Locke and Gary Player of South Africa 
and Peter Thomson of Australia, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
British or British-based golfers (Ballesteros) have now won five of the last 
seven championships. There'll always be an England. 
</P>
<P>
Is Nick Faldo now the world's No. 1 golfer? Well, winning two majors this year 
and coming within a missed putt of the other would seem so to rate him. "I let 
my clubs do the talking," shrugs Nick. "But I feel I'm one of the key players 
at the moment. In the last four seasons, I've won four majors, and I'm the 
first guy in a long time who's won two in one year." 
</P>
<P>
Nick is like Hogan. He weighs his words the way he does his shots. He doesn't 
like them to go drifting off in the rough, either. He spent most of the 
post-tournament news conference discussing what he should do with his swing, if 
you consider that sexy. "I'd like to draw the ball better," he said. "I'm 
trying to do something about getting the top half of my body in sync with my 
legs. I'm tall, and I get too much leg drive." 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly Churchillian in tone or inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo is so low key, his preparations Sunday included a midday sleep. The last 
guy I saw able to fall asleep just before one of the biggest fights of his life 
was Joe Louis. Joe had to be awakened to go in the ring. So, presumably, did 
Faldo. 
</P>
<P>
Most athletes have trouble sleeping the night before a big game. Faldo has no 
trouble sleeping an hour before. That should tell you something about Nick 
Faldo. Maybe, all you need to know. 
</P>
<P>
He made only three bogeys all week. He went into only one sand trap. He had no 
three putts. No wonder he has trouble staying awake. His game bores even him. 
That's not golf, that's something else. 
</P>
<P>
He does, however, have one colorful accessory -- his caddie. His caddie is a 
woman from Sweden, 22-year-old Fanny Sunesson, a bubbly, vivacious type who 
keeps Faldo -- well, awake. 
</P>
<P>
She does this, Nick reports, not by talking to him about the trouble he might 
encounter but by talking about the kind of drapes he might put in his new home, 
or how many bedrooms he has there and what kind of wallpaper he should have and 
whether he will own a dog. "I knew what she was doing," Faldo says with a 
smile. "She was trying to keep my mind off of golf." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. And maybe, like everyone else, she was hoping Nick would hit it into 
trouble once in a while. You don't need a caddie when every shot goes right to 
the fat of the green, the center of the fairway, and every putt is as safe and 
un-adventurous as government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Faldo might be the world's greatest player, much as John Gielgud might have 
been the world's greatest actor. This doesn't prevent the public from 
preferring Bruce Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Nick doesn't know what fun this game can be. I mean, 72 holes without a ball in 
the water or out-of-bounds or under a log and a whole card full of two-putts! 
That's not golf. The game would have died out long ago. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder he's able to fall asleep. He puts everyone else there, too.

BIONDI, EVANS TRYING TO PROVE THEMSELVES, DESPITE '88 GOLDS 
</P>

<P>
Shouldn't eight gold medals mean never having to say you're sorry? 
</P>
<P>
Those were some of the spoils that U.S. swimmers Matt Biondi and Janet Evans 
brought home from the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Biondi also won a silver 
and a bronze. So, perhaps naturally, both were a little bewildered with the 
notion that they had to prove themselves again Sunday at the King County 
Aquatics Center. 
</P>
<P>
And when the third day of the Goodwill Games ended, Evans did not appear much 
more excited about her victory than Biondi felt depressed about his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"There's far too much pressure to win in American sports," Biondi said, 
shrugging off the loss but not his sub-par performance. 
</P>
<P>
For Biondi, it seems as if more attention has been focused in the last two 
years on one of the two gold medals he let get away in Seoul than on the five 
he won. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100-meter butterfly, he had a clear lead until the finish, when he 
misjudged his stroke into the wall and was out-touched by Surinam's Anthony 
Nesty. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi had an opportunity to even the score Sunday when he met Nesty in the 
same event for the first time since Seoul, but he failed. 
</P>
<P>
As for Evans, one of the rare disappointments of her career came Saturday, when 
she lost for the first time in four years in the 400-meter individual medley. 
The surprise winner was fellow Californian Summer Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Although Evans did not react well to the theme of vindication suggested in 
Sunday's newspapers, she did have an opportunity to continue her winning streak 
in the 400-meter freestyle. She has not lost in that event since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Her task did not appear simple because one of her competitors was 200-meter 
world record-holder Heike Friedrich of East Germany. In Seoul, Evans held off 
two surges in the last 50 meters of the 400 freestyle by Friedrich to win the 
gold medal in a world-record time of 4:03.85 that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
Evans did not approach that Sunday, although her time of 4:05.84 was enough to 
win the race and tie for the fourth-fastest ever. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise silver medalist, Haley Lewis, 15, of Australia, finished almost 
five seconds behind in 4:10.78. Friedrich finished seventh in 4:18.32. 
</P>
<P>
So Evans is back? 
</P>
<P>
Where did she go? 
</P>
<P>
Even though she lost the day before, she said Sunday that she was more pleased 
with that silver medal -- which came with a time that was only two seconds off 
her personal record in the 400 individual medley -- than she was with the gold 
medal in the 800 freestyle that she won Friday night. She was 12 seconds behind 
her personal record in that race. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a news conference Sunday to describe her Saturday night, Evans said 
she went to a movie, dinner and bed. "It was nothing different," she said. "You 
just have to put that (the loss) behind you, and you have to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Later, she asked a reporter, "What did people expect me to do, go back to the 
room and bawl my eyes out?" 
</P>
<P>
Biondi said Evans was her same, cheerful self Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just hopping around and supporting the team," he said. "I don't know 
why, but it seems like more people were interested in her loss yesterday than 
in her win today. Certainly, more people are talking about her loss than Summer 
Sanders' win." 
</P>
<P>
Nesty can empathize with Sanders. His victory in Seoul is better known as 
Biondi's loss. 
</P>
<P>
Nesty, who swims for the University of Florida, said he was thinking about that 
before the start of Sunday's rematch, which Biondi was expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so nervous, I couldn't stand it," Nesty said. "I was big-time nervous. I 
guess that's what Matt does to me." 
</P>
<P>
It showed in the first 50 meters, when Biondi, who was just off the 
world-record pace, had the lead. But Nesty caught him with 25 meters remaining 
and won a clear victory. His time was 53.42 to Biondi's 53.82. The difference 
between them in Seoul was .01. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi said that the loss did not upset him because Nesty has proved himself as 
better in the butterfly. But Biondi was upset with their times. Those same 
times in Seoul would have placed them fifth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I lost in Seoul helped me to train better in the butterfly, and 
I did," Biondi said. "I got up at 5:45 every morning and would swim six hours a 
day, all for this moment. Then it happens, and I didn't swim anywhere near as 
fast as I expected. That's what makes this so disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
But the sun was still shining, something to be thankful for in the Pacific 
Northwest, and Biondi could still laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's look at the good side," he said. "I did finish a lot better than I did 
in '88."

the first time since the 1984 Summer Olympics in a major international meet, 
two swimmers tied for first place in an event Sunday at the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
USC senior David Wharton and East Germany's Patrick Kuehl finished the 
400-meter individual medley in 4:17.74. 
</P>
<P>
Kuehl led entering the final 50 meters of the fourth stroke, the freestyle, but 
Wharton accelerated in the final 10 meters and pulled even at the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"In the freestyle, I kind of paced myself to be able to hold on long enough to 
come home strong," said Wharton, the silver medalist in the event at the 1988 
Summer Olympics. Kuehl was fifth in that race. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 in Los Angeles, Nancy Hogshead and Carrie Steinseifer both touched the 
wall at 55.92 seconds in the 100-meter freestyle. RANDY HARVEY

Zoya Ivanova led a Soviet sweep in the women's marathon, winning in 2 hours 34 
minutes 37 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanova, 38, and Irina Bogacheva ran side by side for virtually all of the 
first 17 miles of the 26-mile, 385-yard race. Ivanova, who has won 10 
marathons, then charged in front as her teammate began to tire under humid 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanova's best time was 2:27:57 in finishing second in the 1987 World 
Championships. She also was second in the 1985 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Bogacheva, runner-up in the first Goodwill Games in 1986, again finished 
second, in 2:36:24. Ravilya Barangulova was third in 2:37:40. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Kindelan of Kirkland, Wash., a last-minute replacement, was the first 
American, placing fourth in 2:42:05. 
</P>
<P>
Kindelan said she only learned on Wednesday that she would be included on the 
team, adding that she might have declined if the event wasn't in her home town. 
</P>
<P>
Winthrop Graham of Jamaica won the men's 400 intermediate hurdles by about two 
meters over American David Patrick, his coach, in 48.78. 
</P>
<P>
"He caught me at hurdle six, and I knew I still had a chance, because in 
practice, he usually catches me by the third," said Patrick, who also trains 
with Graham at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Canto of Mexico, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist and world 
record-holder, won the 20-kilometer walk in 1:23:13. 
</P>
<P>
Texas senior Carlette Guidry led a U.S. sweep in the women's 100 meters, 
clocking 11.03, the fastest by an American this year and the third-best in the 
world. Sheila Echols and Michelle Finn followed in 11.05. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Ana Quirot, ranked No. 1 in the world in the women's 400 meters, got off 
to a good start and clocked 50.34 to beat Soviet Lyudmila Dzhigalova by five 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's discus, 21-year-old Ilke Wyludda of East Germany extended her 
two-year winning streak to 23, with a throw of 223-4. It was the fourth victory 
in a week for Wyludda, ranked No. 1 in the world and No. 2 on the all-time 
performers list with a throw of 244-7. 
</P>
<P>
In men's gymnastics, Vitaly Scherbo won two gold medals in the individual 
apparatus events. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, who dominated the gymnastics at the Tacoma Dome, took four 
individual titles outright and tied for the other two. One of the other gold 
medalists was Lance Ringnald of Albuquerque, N.M., who tied with Scherbo on the 
horizontal bars. 
</P>
<P>
In women's sculling, American Alison Townley, a 25-year-old Harvard graduate 
and Olympian, won her second silver medal of the regatta, closing strongly on 
West German Titie Jordache in the single sculls before losing by 1.32 seconds.

A DISAPPOINTING START FOR JOYNER-KERSEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the worst of times -- and distances -- for Jackie Joyner-Kersee on the 
first day of the Goodwill Games heptathlon competition Sunday at Husky Stadium 
in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
She leads after four of the seven events by a comfortable 240 points over the 
Soviet Union's Larisa Nikitina, but Joyner-Kersee is 296 points behind her 
world-record pace of two years ago at the 1988 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she believes she can make up the difference in the final three events 
today, she said: "I'm not going to say no, but, at this time, I probably feel 
it could be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Complaining that she felt dizzy from the exertion and the heat of an 
unseasonably warm afternoon, she left a news conference after answering only a 
few questions to receive medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
She opened with a 12.79 in the 100-meter hurdles, one-tenth of a second off her 
time at the Olympics, improved slightly on her Seoul high jump with a clearance 
of 6-1 1/2, and then met disaster in the shotput and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Her 45-8 1/2 in the shotput was her worst since 1985, and her 24.26 in the 200 
meters was her worst since 1982, leaving her with 3,968 points. Only once in 
her last 11 heptathlons dating back to 1985 has she scored so few points on the 
first day. 
</P>
<P>
"In the shotput, I wasn't pleased at all," she said. "In the 200 meters, I 
don't know what happened. I felt I would run a better 200 meters. I felt good. 
But I was surprised at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Although her time was not impressive, she still won the 200 meters by almost 
four-tenths of a second. The runners appeared to be moving into a stiff 
headwind down the straightaway, but the display on the wind gauge indicated 
that there was none. 
</P>
<P>
Her goal for this meet was to score 7,300 points, nine points better than her 
world record, but she now will find it difficult to break 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not where I should be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But, indicative of her dominance in the event, even on one of her worst days, 
she is far ahead of Nikitina, the only other woman in history to score more 
than 7,000 points. She has 3,728 points, 103 ahead of third-place Gea Johnson 
from Arizona State. RANDY HARVEY

UNSER SPLASHES TO RAIN-SHORTENED VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Unser Jr., who earlier in the day signed a three-year contract extension 
with the Galles-Kraco team, overcame terrible track conditions to win Sunday's 
rain-shortened Molson-Indy at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm relieved to win and relieved it's over," Unser said after taking the lead 
for the final time on the 54th lap and running away from the rest of the 27-car 
field. "We didn't have enough cars out there at the end to keep a groove going. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't hear the pits on my radio, but I was talking to them and I told 
them about three laps from when they called it, 'The race is over. They need to 
shut this thing down before I put the car into the fence.' " 
</P>
<P>
Unser led the final 40 laps on the 1.78-mile, 11-turn temporary circuit winding 
through Exhibition Place and onto Lakeshore Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Rain began two hours before the race, which started under a caution flag. 
Conditions became progressively worse and officials of CART, the Indy-car 
sanctioning body, finally decided to stop the race after 94 laps, nine short of 
the scheduled distance. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third victory of the season and the 12th career triumph for Unser, 
28. He averaged only 75.997 m.p.h. and won $138,908. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Andretti, who had won three of the last four races, led early in the 
167.32-mile event but lost time during an early pit stop and ran second in the 
battle of Chevrolet-powered Lolas, crossing the finish line 37.8 seconds 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
A burp from his car tested Geoff Bodine's nerves a lap from the finish, but his 
gamble on fuel paid off at Long Pond, Pa., with his second NASCAR victory of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart stopped," Bodine said after winning the AC Spark Plug 500, after a 
caution flag prompted a 2 1/2-mile sprint to the finish. "But then it took off. 
I looked at the fuel pressure -- that's the only indicator we have -- and it 
bounced up. It never gurgled again, so I just held my breath." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Ragen's spin with four laps left let Bodine conserve fuel during the 
caution period. After a cool-down lap following his victory, Bodine's 22-gallon 
tank held only six-tenths of a gallon of gas. 
</P>
<P>
All but Harry Gant among Bodine's nearest challengers had made late pit stops. 
</P>
<P>
The race got back to green for the final lap, and Bodine easily held on when 
Gant ran out of gas behind a lapped car and Bill Elliott could get only within 
1.29 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Bodine, who won April 29 at Martinsville, Va., recorded an average speed of 
124.103 m.p.h. and won $58,500 on the tri-oval at Pocono International Raceway, 
where he also won in June of 1988 as his fuel was running out. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Wallace finished third, followed by Dale Earnhardt and Davey Allison. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Waltrip, nursing a broken left leg from a crash July 6, started his 
500th career NASCAR race. As planned, he left the car on the second lap for 
relief driver Jimmy Horton, who finished 20th. 
</P>
<P>
Belgian Guy Renard was killed in a 24-hour endurance race at Spa-Francorchamps, 
Belgium, when his Toyota Corolla crashed into the railings, collided with two 
other cars and exploded in a ball of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said Renard, 27, lost control of his car shortly after midnight and 
spun into the railings before turning back onto the track. There, the car was 
hit by two other competitors before exploding. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Paul Tracy won the Toronto leg of the 1990 American Racing Series, his 
seventh victory in eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
The Scarborough, Canada, native started next to pole-winner Ted Prappas on the 
front row, but took the lead on the second lap of the 42-lap event and held the 
lead for the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy, who earned $17,000, averaged 86.538 m.p.h. on the 1.78-mile, 11-turn 
road circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Houston overcame a poor qualifying effort by charging through the field 
and banging past Chuck Bown with 26 laps left to win the Coors 200 Busch Grand 
National race Saturday night at South Boston, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, worth $9,609, was the fourth of the season for Houston and No. 23 
of his career.

EUPHORIA FROM BEATING A BLOCKING SLED; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: BILL HAWKINS' FIRST MAJOR INJURY -- TO HIS LEFT KNEE -- FINALLY HAS 
RESPONDED TO REHABILITATION. 
</P>

<P>
To date, Bill Hawkins' greatest moment as a Ram probably came July 14, almost 
two months before the season opener, before a dozen spectators, tops. He 
knocked around the blocking sled at Rams Park as if it was standing still. OK, 
it was. But when he sprang from his three-point stance, his left leg actually 
joined the party. Later, there was a quiet celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was my best day, by far," Hawkins said. "It (the leg) didn't feel like a 
string of spaghetti hanging off my left side." 
</P>
<P>
Food for thought, considering the Rams are counting on first-round things from 
their defensive end and top choice of 1989. Hawkins wasn't so sure what he 
would be bringing to the field, until, well, a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 11, just as he appeared ready to silence critics who had waited 
impatiently for his first NFL sack, Hawkins collapsed in a fourth-quarter heap 
against San Francisco, partially tearing a left knee ligament. It was 
surgically repaired three days later. 
</P>
<P>
That was then, though. This is now. Why was Hawkins, the team's biggest 
pass-rushing hope on the line since Jack Youngblood, still limping in July? 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, too, wondered what had become of the miracles of modern medicine and 
rehabilitation. He'd never been injured, unless you count contusions and 
concussions. Hawkins doesn't: 
</P>
<P>
"Concussions are nothing." 
</P>
<P>
What weren't the doctors telling him? 
</P>
<P>
"The knee took a long time to respond," Hawkins said. "Gie (strength coach 
Garrett Giemont) was saying, 'No problem, no problem.' But I don't think it was 
three weeks ago that I could barely come out of a stance. Maybe a month. I was 
worried. Giemont kept assuring me, but I would be thinking, 'I can't come out 
of my stance!' " 
</P>
<P>
Giemont tried explaining that there was a distinct difference between a knee 
that bends well enough to pick up the newspaper and one that bends well enough 
to pick up a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"If he worked at IBM, he'd be out of our clinic," Giemont said, "but we're 
talking about a football rehabilitation. . . . It's getting him prepared to get 
back to playing in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Giemont said he understands Hawkins' concerns because it's the player's first 
serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
"When you haven't been hurt, it's like going down to the beach and putting your 
toe in the water," Giemont said. "What do you do from there?" 
</P>
<P>
The coaches are handling Hawkins with care until early August, when they plan 
to turn him loose in full-contact drills. If they are secretly worried about 
his knee, they aren't saying. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a recurring injury," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "What he's 
building up is strength. We don't have a wounded guy." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Rams are drawing up all sorts of new defensive schemes with 
Hawkins in mind. The team plans to pair him on early downs with linebacker 
Kevin Greene on the weak side of the defense, or, the side opposite the 
offense's tight end. 
</P>
<P>
It will mean less responsibility for stopping the run and more on rushing the 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to play it," Hawkins said. "I just cannot wait. This is going to 
be fun. True-blue fun. It'll be like what we used to do back in school." 
</P>
<P>
That would be the University of Miami, where Hawkins emerged as the 21st pick 
of the first round in 1989. His development was slowed by his signing late, and 
Hawkins didn't turn many heads with the Rams last season, although he had made 
considerable progress by December. He finished the season with 11 tackles and 
no sacks in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said he doesn't feel pressure to perform up to the expectations of a 
former first-rounder, but he promises he will do just that. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants me to play well more than I do," he said. "If I'm not good enough 
to play, I won't consider myself a waste. If I'm trying my hardest and I don't 
produce, then it wasn't my fault. But I know that I can produce. And I will." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said he took to heart some early advice from Giemont, whom he would 
soon get to know well on the long road through rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got here, Gie took me aside and said, 'This isn't college, this 
isn't high school, this is a career,' " Hawkins recalled. " 'You have your ups 
and downs. Hopefully, you'll be here in 10 years.' And I took to that."

SANDERS POSTS BOND, JOINS REDSKINS' TRAINING CAMP

<P>
Wide receiver Rickey Sanders reported to the Washington Redskins' training camp 
Sunday after posting bond in Houston the day before on attempted murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders reported a couple of hours before the 11 p.m. Sunday deadline for 
rookies and selected wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders made no statement about the charges, which resulted from an altercation 
with a parking attendant May 1. 
</P>
<P>
He was among about 80 players who joined the team, which will begin practice 
today. 
</P>
<P>
One of three Redskins receivers to gain at least 1,000 yards in receptions last 
season, Sanders posted $5,000 bond in a Houston court Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to be ordered to return to Houston Friday for a court hearing. 
Sam Jamus, manager of a parking service outside a topless bar, alleges that 
Sanders tried to run him down after an altercation in the parking lot there. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders has denied trying to hit Jamus. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders isn't expected to miss any practice, but coaches are wondering what 
effect the turmoil will have on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if it gets to where he misses time, that becomes a distraction," Coach 
Joe Gibbs said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to something going on in training camp, but not something 
potentially of this magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
"There seem to be two sides to it. We're just hopeful that what Ricky says 
comes out really happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins' interest might involve more than merely what effect the charges 
will have on Sanders' performance, however. San Antonio, Tex., attorney Tom 
Hall, who is representing Jamus, said he might name the Redskins in a civil 
suit he said he would file today. 
</P>
<P>
Charley Casserly, Redskin general manager, declined to comment on the legal 
issues, saying only, "I think Ricky will put it all in perspective and give us 
100%."

Saying it was just a case of miscommunication, Howie Long reported to the 
Raiders' training camp late Saturday night after a one-day unexcused absence. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Long fail to report to training camp on Friday, the first day veterans 
were due? 
</P>
<P>
"Not to be sarcastic, but it's personal," Long said. "I just had to take care 
of some family business. It was just a case of something popping up at the last 
minute, and I had no choice." 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't Long inform Coach Art Shell of his absence? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't speak to Art, but I spoke to management and everything was fine," 
Long said. 
</P>
<P>
But Shell apparently never got the message. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said everything was fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I met with him and I was satisfied with everything he had to say," Shell said. 
"This chapter is closed." 
</P>
<P>
While the case is closed on Long, who practiced for the first time Sunday, the 
cases remain open for the Raiders' eight holdouts: quarterback Steve Beuerlein, 
tailback Marcus Allen, fullback Steve Smith, cornerback Mike Haynes, safety 
Vann McElroy, tight end Mike Dyal, defensive end Greg Townsend and defensive 
end Anthony Smith, their No. 1 draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
Has there been any progress in negotiations? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just waiting for them to tell me when they're coming in," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders released safety Russell Carter, a seven-year veteran. "We're going 
in a different direction and we feel comfortable with the younger players we 
have," Coach Art Shell said. "We released him early to give him an opportunity 
to catch on with someone else." . . . The Raiders also cut Anthony Grove, a 
rookie wide receiver from LaVerne. . . . Defensive end Lyle Alzado, attempting 
to make a comeback at 41, didn't practice Sunday. Shell said that Alzado had 
suffered a strained calf muscle. Alzado's status is listed as day to day. . . . 
Linebacker Bruce Klosterman sat out Sunday's practice because of a hamstring 
injury, and running back Leon Perry was sidelined because of a shoulder injury.

JOVIAL'S FIRST RACE ON DIRT RESULTS IN NARROW VICTORY IN SWAPS STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's unlikely that Jovial and Silver Ending, the first two horses across the 
wire in Sunday's $210,000 Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park, will meet again soon. 
</P>
<P>
Jovial, a horse whose six-race career had been strictly on grass before Sunday, 
has found a home on the dirt. And Silver Ending, despite winning the Arkansas 
Derby and one other stake on dirt, is going to return to the grass as soon as 
trainer Ron McAnally can find a spot for him. 
</P>
<P>
Jovial, with a rush from the outside under Gary Stevens, beat Silver Ending by 
a neck, and it was 3 1/2 lengths farther back to Stalwart Charger, who went off 
a 3-5 favorite in the crowd of 24,723 after three consecutive stakes victories. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse was in a good position at the top of the stretch, and then there was 
no response," said Pico Perdomo, who trains Stalwart Charger. "He's supposed to 
take off, but he didn't do it today. Maybe something happened to him. Maybe 
nothing happened, and he just got beat." 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay, who had ridden Stalwart Charger for the first time on July 1, 
when they won the Silver Screen Handicap, also seemed puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is that he didn't want to open up on those other horses at the 
quarter pole," Pincay said. "I thought I could open up on the field, and they 
would have to come and get me. The last part, he felt like he got tired. I 
really don't know why he stopped like that at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Running slow fractions, Stalwart Charger made the lead and held it until the 
horses straightened out for the stretch run. Silver Ending, never far back in 
second place, took over near the eighth pole, but Jovial was running even 
faster on his right flank and edged ahead with about 40 yards left. Silver 
Ending tried to come back, but Jovial wasn't quitting. 
</P>
<P>
Jovial, the third choice behind Stalwart Charger and Silver Ending in the 
four-horse field, paid $8.60 and $3.80 with no show betting and was clocked for 
1 1/4 miles in 2:01 1/5. Silver Ending, carrying 126 pounds, six more than 
Jovial, paid $3.80 to place. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Jack Munari, a Paso Robles real estate man, and trained by Bruce 
Jackson, Jovial earned $120,000, which was about $17,000 more than the 
English-bred colt had collected while winning three of six starts on grass. 
Jovial's career began last year with with three races in Europe and he had won 
his last two starts at Hollywood Park, including the Cinema Handicap on June 
10. 
</P>
<P>
Munari and Jackson used to race quarter horses together. Several years ago, 
they won the Rainbow Derby, a $600,000 race, at Ruidoso Downs with Corporate 
Bug, a horse they had claimed for $12,500. 
</P>
<P>
"Jovial's breeding (Northern Jove and Rensaler, a Stop the Music mare) 
indicated that he might like dirt, and we've been working three months to get 
him ready for the dirt," Jackson said. "We sure picked the right time to try 
him on dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who won the Arkansas Derby with Silver Ending in April, has won six 
races in the last two days to virtually clinch the season's riding title at 
Hollywood. Going into the last day today, he has 59 wins, three more than Pat 
Valenzuela and four more than Pincay. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens is three for three on Jovial. "When I worked this horse in company (on 
dirt), he wasn't bothered by dirt hitting him in the face," Stevens said. "The 
first time he worked in company, it didn't bother him. I was surprised that he 
handled the dirt as well as he did. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an awesome colt. He made the lead today a lot easier than I thought he 
would." 
</P>
<P>
Jovial came back coughing from one of those dirt workouts, and an endoscopic 
examination showed that he had bled internally. That enabled Jackson to run him 
on Lasix, the bleeder medication, in the Swaps. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye rode Silver Ending for the first time. "I was surprised that 
my horse made as long a run as he did, and he galloped out strong, too," 
Delahoussaye said. "Knowing that, I might have gotten into him at the 
three-eighths pole and maybe been a little more gung-ho about it. I had seen 
some of the horse's races on tape, but you never know sometimes until you ride 
the horse." 
</P>
<P>
The only time Silver Ending has been on grass, he won an allowance race at 
Hollywood last fall. Since his fifth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby, 
McAnally has been saying that the Silver Hawk colt would like grass better. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know whether to run in the Swaps," McAnally said. "But the way the 
race came up, I figured there was just one horse (Stalwart Charger) to beat. I 
wasn't sure about that horse (Jovial) coming off the grass. My horse will be 
going on the grass from here. Definitely." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Like Jovial, Steinlen is another grass specialist who will be switched to dirt. 
Steinlen, who has made only one start on dirt, has been added to the field for 
the Arlington Challenge Cup on Aug. 4. Steinlen, last year's male grass 
champion, won the Caesars International Saturday at Atlantic City. In his only 
dirt race, Steinlen finished seventh at Santa Anita in March of 1988. . . . 
Hollywood Park's stewards lectured owner Jay Goldinger, who appeared in the 
winner's circle Sunday with a for-sale sign after his Putting, running for a 
$75,000 claiming price, won the seventh race. A multiple stakes winner, Putting 
has won 10 of 45 races and earned almost $800,000. "We frowned on what 
Goldinger did," steward Tom Ward said. "The trainer (Julio Canani) apparently 
wasn't part of it. It looked like he didn't even want to be in the (winner's 
circle) picture because of the sign." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker's on a hot streak, with four wins from his last eight runners. 
Dean, a 2-year-old colt, won Sunday to give Shoemaker his fifth training win in 
17 starts. . . . Richard Mandella saddled two winners, tying him with Ron 
McAnally for second place in the standings. They are one winner behind Wayne 
Lukas, who has 22 wins for the meet. 
</P>
<P>
Bel Air Paster was scratched from the Swaps. . . . Kent Desormeaux, riding Toby 
Jug, claimed foul against Stalwart Charger and Laffit Pincay for interference 
on the far turn, but the stewards ruled that there was no effect on the final 
order of finish. . . . Bel Air Paster is entered in the second division of the 
Oceanside Stakes, the opening-day feature at Del Mar on Wednesday. . . . Today 
at Hollywood, Petite Ile tries to become the second female to win the Sunset 
Handicap and trainer Charlie Whittingham, who saddles Live the Dream, tries to 
win the stake for the 11th time. The only female to win the Sunset was Typecast 
in 1972.

DEAN GIVES SHOEMAKER 5TH VICTORY AS A TRAINER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All-time winning jockey Bill Shoemaker, who retired with 8,833 winners, has 
heated up in his new role as trainer by winning with four of his last six 
starters at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year old Shoemaker scored his fifth training victory in 17 races Sunday 
when Dean, a two-year old Tri Jet colt owned by Fred W. Hooper, came from off 
the pace to win the sixth race over heavily favored Sea Cadet. Dean raced the 
six furlongs in 1:10 3/5 to win by 1 3/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the five wins, Shoemaker's horses have three seconds and a pair 
of thirds in 17 races.

Health Insurer Sued Over Cancellations: A class-action suit was filed Tuesday 
against Great Republic Insurance Co. for its cancellation in May of health 
insurance to about 14,000 customers. The breach-of-contract suit was brought in 
Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
It is on behalf of those covered under a master policy for group insurance who 
were being treated for an insured medical condition when Great American 
canceled. The policy expressly gave Great American the right to cancel 
coverage. But the suit contends that the insurer "devised a scheme" to deprive 
the insured of their coverage by terminating the policy, then offering a 
conversion policy with limited coverage. At the time of the cancellations, 
claims were exceeding premiums, Great Republic attorney John Chakman said.

Credit Card Firms Win Round: A federal judge handed a victory Monday to Visa 
and MasterCard by temporarily barring 19 telemarketing defendants from 
laundering credit card sales drafts or indicating that they are authorized to 
accept Visa or MasterCard charges. U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los 
Angeles issued the preliminary injunction in a suit by Visa International 
Service Assn. and MasterCard International Inc. The fraud suit alleges that 21 
defendants, including telemarketing firms in several states, operated "boiler 
room" telephone operations in which they obtained consumers' credit card 
numbers, then submitted orders for unauthorized charges or failed to deliver 
ordered merchandise. (Filed July 23, 1990. Case No. 90-3388)

RADISSON HUNTS FOR MUSCOVITES WHO'LL SAY 'YES'; 
</P>
<P>
HOSPITALITY: AS IT PREPARES TO OPEN ITS LUXURY HOTEL IN MOSCOW, THE FIRM'S MAIN 
CHALLENGE IS TO FIND AND TRAIN STAFF IN WESTERN-STYLE SERVICE.

The Radisson Hotel people are shipping in the furniture, computers and 
facsimile machines in preparation for the fall opening of the first 
American-managed hotel in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Radisson Slavjanskaya, a 430-room enterprise connected to a 165-suite 
business center, is a challenge like none other for Radisson, a unit of the 
$6.2-billion (annual revenue) Carlson Companies of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing like it in Moscow, where a modern hospitality industry just 
doesn't exist, often to the dismay of American and other foreign business 
people. Even the concept of service is foreign. 
</P>
<P>
Equipping the operation with American television, communications modems, laser 
printers, phone lines, video conferencing gear and the like, tough as it will 
be, isn't the real challenge. Radisson has done that all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
The main challenge, faced before only by McDonald's, is to find Soviet workers 
and motivate them to say "Yes, I can," a Radisson slogan, when a more 
traditional Soviet response has been to say "No, I can't." 
</P>
<P>
Radisson's venture is a joint one with Intourist, the well-staffed Soviet 
foreign tourism ministry, which built the structure. But none of the workers 
will be hired from it. 
</P>
<P>
"We want young, friendly people -- people inclined toward helping others," said 
Juergen Bartels, who heads the Carlson Hospitality Group, a $2.2-billion 
enterprise -- including Radisson -- within the Carlson Companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We will look for nurses and teachers," he continues. "We will not be hiring 
any of the hotel and restaurant people of Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
The entire operation, says Bartels, a perfectionist who worked his way up 
through European and North American hotels, rises or falls with the quality of 
the people. His staff, he said, will choose, train, motivate and rate them. 
</P>
<P>
Bartels and his crew plan to employ 30 full-time foreigners, Americans 
included, and bring in 20 others temporarily from Radisson operations during 
the first weeks. Each foreigner will be understudied by one or two Soviets.

Gas Prices Are Flat: Gasoline prices, which normally rise in the summer, 
remained steady the past two weeks. Average price for a gallon of gas was 
$1.1772, according to the most recent Lundberg Survey of gasoline stations 
nationwide. Prices have been stable during the early part of the summer thanks 
to lower crude oil prices, Trilby Lundberg said.

New Zealand's government has put the brakes on its controversial program to 
sell state-owned businesses to the private sector, just three months before the 
troubled Labor administration faces a general election. 
</P>
<P>
State-Owned Enterprises Minister Richard Prebble said New Zealand's debt crisis 
is over. Proceeds of the sales have been earmarked for cutting the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Labor has sold numerous state enterprises in recent years, including Air New 
Zealand, the energy company Petrocorp and Telecom Corp. But the deals have 
aroused public anger, notably when Telecom was sold to a U.S.-dominated 
consortium last month for $2.5 billion.

A spokesman for Japanese multibillionaire Masao Nangaku said the Tokyo 
businessman has not abandoned plans to build the $90-million, 35-story Minami 
Tower skyscraper in downtown Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Nelson, the Minami Development Corp. executive vice president who was 
overseeing construction of the office complex, resigned last week during a 
meeting with Nangaku in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said he stepped down after the Japanese businessman announced his 
intention to walk away from the project, leaving unpaid architects and 
construction workers, torn-up sidewalks and damaged streets adjacent to the 
construction site. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said Nangaku, who also owns the Dunes Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, is 
strapped for cash and is closing down or scaling back projects worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
However, Minami spokesman Fred Lewis denied that the project, which would 
become Nevada's largest office structure, is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg Nelson went to Japan, got into a beef with Nangaku and quit," Lewis said 
Thursday. "What we have here is a disgruntled former employee."

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: VENTURING -- REALISTICALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brentwood Associates, L.A.'s premier venture capital firm, has $55 million 
waiting to fund brilliant new business ideas for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
But like other investment firms, Brentwood is taking a much more disciplined 
view of what constitutes "brilliance" these days. In the late 1980s, many big 
ideas didn't pay off for venture investors as they expected. So money is 
tighter, and more entrepreneurs are likely to go begging. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, venture capitalists invested $3.3 billion overall, an 11% drop from 
1988 and 15% less than 1987's record $3.9 billion, says Venture Economics' 
monthly Venture Capital Journal in Needham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Still, venture financiers aren't sitting on their wallets. In fact, "There's 
much more emphasis today on us going out and finding opportunities, rather than 
waiting for them to come in the door," says Brentwood partner Roger Davisson. 
Brentwood hunts for entrepreneurs at new-industry conferences, through 
executives at major companies who have contact with new products, and via 
networking with other entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
Brentwood invests nationwide, but it hopes to put a substantial amount of its 
venture dollars into Southern California enterprises in the early '90s. Medical 
technology in Orange County is a key focus of the firm, but Brentwood hopes 
that other hot business ideas will emerge from the Southland during the next 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a legion of brilliant entrepreneurs in Southern California, but 
they all became real estate developers," Davisson says, only half joking. That 
business doesn't lend itself to venture financing. 
</P>
<P>
But real estate here is unlikely to be the boom business in the '90s that it 
was in the '70s and '80s. That -- and the layoffs of many talented aerospace 
workers -- could lead to a wave of business start-ups in new fields, Davisson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
David Chonette, another Brentwood principal, notes that "it was refugees from 
aerospace who originally spawned the medical technology industries in Orange 
County" in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
What does it take for an entrepreneur to attract a venture investor in 1990? 
Davisson says his firm wants to see strong management, a significant 
technological advantage in the product or service and a "very significant 
market opportunity" -- a market at least several hundred million dollars in 
size. 
</P>
<P>
Those criteria haven't changed much from the '80s. What has changed is that 
deal makers want to see entrepreneurs take a more realistic view of venture 
financing -- especially regarding the stake in the business that the 
entrepreneur will have to give up and regarding the changes the financier may 
suggest in the business plan. "People who are unrealistic are going to be more 
disappointed now than ever," Davisson says. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs may view venture money as cash to fund more risk, for more 
potential reward. But "the spending of venture money should be to lower the 
risk," Davisson says -- to get the initial product out, for example, or to 
strengthen the management team to guarantee the company's long-term success. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs should recognize that venture capitalists can bring more than 
money to the party, Davisson says. Experienced financiers can bring market 
contacts, a better business plan and the knowledge of how to recruit the right 
key employees, he says. Finding the best managers is a constant challenge, 
Davisson says. The right product is one thing, but before Brentwood commits its 
investors' dollars, the firm wants to be sure that the managers running the 
company can get the product to market, and manage the bumps along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, three young companies that Brentwood is considering financing all 
need strengthening of management, the partners say. "There are never enough 
good managers around," Davisson says. 
</P>
<P>
The venture financier's ultimate goal, of course, is to sell the business in 
two to seven years for a fantastic sum, either to another company or to the 
general public via stock. Although some independent entrepreneurs may cringe at 
that idea, it's the reality of the business -- and it's the way entrepreneurs 
become millionaires, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly: The average stockbroker earned $78,711 in 1989, up 10.4% from $71,309 
in 1988, the Securities Industry Assn. says in a new report. The earnings rise 
was the first since 1986, when the average figure peaked at $97,100. The 1989 
increase was helped by a turnaround in broker earnings at regional firms, which 
tend to concentrate more on the average investor than major Wall Street houses.

L.A. brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards has pulled its "buy" 
recommendation on Paramount Communications, citing weakness in the company's 
summer movie menu (mainly "Days of Thunder" and "Another 48 Hours"). Analyst 
Paul Marsh also lowered his fiscal 1990 earnings estimate to $2.30 a share from 
$2.72. Paramount stock has fallen to $40.75 from $52.875 earlier this year. 
Meanwhile, Dean Witter recently initiated coverage of Paramount. Analyst Alan 
Gould rates the stock a "hold," noting that the big question regarding 
Paramount remains the same: What will the firm do with its $1.1 billion cash 
hoard? . . .

<P>
Four-in-the-morning copy shop humor, Guy Fish-style: Tell the customer you 
thought he meant 500 copies shred, not red. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the joke going. 
</P>
<P>
As the customer looks at you, with a bleary-eyed, just-get-it-done look, tell 
him you think you can pretty much glue the shredded mess together in some kind 
of presentable form. 
</P>
<P>
But under the counter, have 500 printed, perfect red copies ready to the grab. 
</P>
<P>
And, Fish says, know when the joke has gone too far, that moment before the 
customer slams his fist on the counter, the moment before his hand lurches for 
those complimentary scissors. . . . 
</P>
<P>
To Fish, the split-second reaction, seen on a customer's face when he pulls his 
shred-not-red gag -- an instant look of frenzy and doom -- can make his whole 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"For the joke to work, you have to keep a totally straight face," says Fish, 
night supervisor of the graveyard shift at Kinko's Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It's a 24-hour ink joint where giant copy machines named Fred and Wilma 
ka-chung into the wee hours; the fax machine and laser printer buzz until dawn; 
and customers filter in like zombies, all with discernible late-night looks of 
panic and exhaustion in glassy, pleading eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Since he started the graveyard shift a year ago, the 26-year-old Xerox jockey 
has accumulated many bizarre tales of people driven to the edge by deadlines, 
semester exams, resume woes, job pressures and Little League newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
He regards with them with a kind of incredulity. 
</P>
<P>
And even fondness. 
</P>
<P>
Fish, dressed in a black shirt and black pants with a gleaming white tie, runs 
to and from Fred and Wilma loading paper -- runs because he has to, but also 
because he seems to like helping people out of the muck of despair. 
</P>
<P>
Fish, a smiling, helpful ranger in a forest of terra green and solar yellow 
("colors of the week, 6 1/2 cents a copy"), can do everything in Kinko's -- 
except precisely answer the glaring question: 
</P>
<P>
What are all these people doing here at this hour? 
</P>
<P>
Copy shops, like society, have changed. 
</P>
<P>
Once they were nothing more than drop-off counters where the obligatory "You 
Want It When?" cartoon hung forbiddingly on a wall, the same spot where a 
shifty-eyed worker would lean and do just about anything except make 
photocopies. 
</P>
<P>
But as technology plowed on, society wised up. You do not need a nuclear 
physics degree to make a photocopy. You do not even need one to clear a paper 
path when the machine breaks down. And we already know how to use scissors and 
glue sticks, so hey. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Americans were chanting: We Want It Now. We want it now, even if it 
means taking matters into our own hands. We'll set the type on the personal 
computer and run it out on the laser printer. We'll pick the colors, set the 
toner. We'll cut and paste, reduce and enlarge. We are a people of vision who 
know that fax number in New York by heart. 
</P>
<P>
Step aside. 
</P>
<P>
The masses have a million little things to do -- right now. 
</P>
<P>
Stores like Kinko's, now a limited-partnership franchise with 500 locations 
nationwide (45 in Southern California), capitalize on every man, woman and 
undergraduate's need to print things cheaply -- 6 cents a copy. Invitations, 
manuscripts, screenplays, cover letters, posters, fliers, Christmas letters and 
even opera librettos are on the list of things to do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the bar of the 1990s," one customer t the Long Beach store says with 
a laugh, while she runs off copies of her resume as the clock nears midnight. 
Her boss doesn't know she's job-hunting, and she casts nervous glances around 
the store, as if she is about to be caught committing a late-night crime. "I 
mean, you've got all kinds of people in here, dressed in whatever, all getting 
some kind of fix. Except people are stressed out all the time in here. I know I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
The bar image fits: 10 customers slouch against Fish's counter, while he hops 
around, helping each one. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes of his time is precious when there are: self-serve copy machines 
that need paper refills; people who need 400 fliers in every color of the 
rainbow ("except salmon," one customer orders), and another person who needs 
help running an Apple Macintosh computer. 
</P>
<P>
Let Fish be the bartender, because he says he wants to comfort these people, 
somehow. And he understands the root of all his stressed-out patrons' problems: 
procrastination. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be as nice as I can to everyone, first thing," he says. "But, you 
know, the reason people are always so panicky is because they've put off 
whatever it is they've got until the very last minute. It can get wild in 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Wild. 
</P>
<P>
Like the man who stumbled into the Long Beach store and had a heart attack. "I 
mean literally," says Fish, who called 911. 
</P>
<P>
Or the woman who didn't want to use the self-service machines and screamed at 
Fish at 3 a.m. to stop a 1,000-copy job on Fred to make her one copy. "I calmed 
her down," he says with pride. 
</P>
<P>
Or the early-morning gang shooting that left a man dead on the street in front 
of the store, to Fish's horrified gape. "The store stayed open," he says and 
shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Kinko's can get very crazy at night," agrees Laura Gaber, manager of the Long 
Beach store. When it began its 24-hour schedule, she says, even employees had a 
hard time staying awake through the night. "They would call 976-WAKE (a 
telephone wake-up service) to get them up before the shift was over." 
</P>
<P>
Now the store's name is close to becoming a generic term for "late-night 
copies," and the days of fighting sleep on the shift are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Other copy shops and photocopy printing firms are staying open 24 hours to meet 
the demands of people who need to work into the night -- "usually because it's 
the only time they have free to get stuff done," Fish says. 
</P>
<P>
In 16 years, three people have been ejected from his store for "overreacting, 
mainly," says Eric Brandin, president of the Copy Spot in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Known by its giant signs and yellow canopies, the store stays open for 
customers until midnight. But a night shift comes in and finishes large orders 
for a dawn deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"People are so relieved when they find someone like us open late at night," 
Brandin says. "They find out that their daughter has to have 50 copies of the 
script for the school play the next morning and they say things like 'Thank 
God, you're still open.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brandin even has regulars, people who frequent his store so often that they 
have free rein of the machines. 
</P>
<P>
The store is usually crowded until closing, he adds, and often tension levels 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
But Brandin has a plan when someone gets a little too panicky, a little too 
close to the edge: "Basically, I try to isolate the person and get through to 
them that everything will work out. It's amazing . . . someone can come in here 
and they will really be in a panic, all strung out, and all it takes is for 
them to see that whatever it is will eventually get done. Just watching the 
copies come out can be soothing for them. 
</P>
<P>
"People are at their worst when they think you aren't paying attention to their 
needs," Brandin continues, almost therapist-like. "When you get a crowd packed 
in here together, everyone thinks their job is the most important one . . . 
someone has to be in control." 
</P>
<P>
It's after 1 a.m. and Fish is telling stories as fast as copies are spewing out 
of Fred and Wilma. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the color copier, customer Patrick Whiteleather, 18, is blowing up 
pictures of Boy George. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to look like this by Friday," he says, holding up a picture of the pop 
singer. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, Whiteleather is a professional Boy George impersonator -- and a 
pro at making his own color copies. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, everybody has their purpose for being here," Fish says. 
</P>
<P>
A giggling group of teen-age girls struggle to put out a newsletter for their 
summer camp. They furiously type, cut, glue and chatter. At one of the 
computers, a woman sits and works on her resume while her boyfriend gives her 
advice and a neck rub. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman is desperately seeking stencils. "My roommate woke me up and 
demanded stencils," she says to Fish, groggily. Since he has none, Fish decides 
he can go one better and bring this sleepy soul in the 1990s: He has her 
typeset what she wants on the laser printer, then sends her on her way. 
</P>
<P>
Fish says he's a vampire: "You get home in the morning and you start doing 
things, and before you know it, it's 4 or 5 in the afternoon already, and so 
I'm like, 'Should I sleep?' And I decide not to, and everything's fine till 
about 4 a.m. People come in to pick up their copies and go 'Guy, you really 
look tired.' " 
</P>
<P>
He likes the night crowd, the rock bands who create their psychedelic fliers, 
the fidgety businessmen fretting over presentations. 
</P>
<P>
"This corner is basically all 24 hours," he says, motioning to the intersection 
of 7th Street and Pacific Coast Highway. "You got Jack-in-the-Box,the gas 
stations, the convenience store, Denny's. . . . Why should anyone go to sleep?" 
</P>
<P>
Closer to 2 a.m., he unloads reams of paper to last through the night. A cool 
breeze blows through the store and he pulls the glass door shut and peers out 
into the night. The neon sign ("Open 24 Hours") casts a red glow over his face. 
</P>
<P>
For now, it's just him and the teen-agers' newsletter frenzy. And for Fish, 
awaiting the dawn while the copy machines keep rolling, everything is all 
right.

FILM TITLE SATIRE OR STEREOTYPE?; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: BLACK ACTIVISTS SAY THE NAME OF THE FILM PERPETUATES A STEREOTYPE. 
NEWSPAPERS ARE ALTERING THE WORDING IN ADS IN ORDER NOT TO OFFEND READERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Would a movie by any other name draw as much attention? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not, say the black activists who have protested what they see as the 
offensive title of the French-Canadian film "How to Make Love to a Negro 
Without Getting Tired." At least two major black readership newspapers have 
banned ads for the movie from their pages, while some of the nation's general 
circulation newspapers have agreed only to publish ads with an abbreviated 
title: "How to Make Love. . . !!!" 
</P>
<P>
The title, which the film's black writer says was intended to be satirical, 
also puts many newspapers in the awkward position of using the abbreviated 
title in their advertising pages and the whole title in news stories. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not comfortable with this decision; it seems puzzling on the surface," 
said Dennis Britton, editor of the Chicago Sun-Times, one of several papers 
that is using different versions of the title in their advertising and 
editorial sections. 
</P>
<P>
Britton, who handles all questions of content at the paper, said he decided it 
was OK to use the full title in news stories where "you can more fully explain 
what (the title) means" to the reader and place it in a context. At the same 
time, he said, he couldn't defend using the full title in a display ad with no 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should go out of our way to offend our readers," Britton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy has been a publicity boon to the film's New York-based 
distributor, Angelika Films. "How to Make Love. . . !!!" is a low-budget film 
based on a 1985 novel about a black Haitian writer in Montreal who tests his 
sexual prowess on a succession of white women, and keeps a diary about the 
experiences. It has no major stars, an unknown director, and played in 40 other 
countries without controversy before beginning its U.S. release. 
</P>
<P>
The film has opened in seven American cities (it opens Friday in Los Angeles) 
and at each stop has prompted public debate. 
</P>
<P>
The chief objection to the movie comes from the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People. In a June 15 letter, NAACP President Hazel N. 
Dukes wrote to Angelika Films complaining that "the title perpetuates the 
stereotype of people of African descent being consumed by passion to the 
exclusion of all other emotion." 
</P>
<P>
Angelika president Joseph J. M. Saleh said the use of the word Negro is 
intended in the "international sense," while he said that, "the American sense 
of the word carries with it the weight of 200 years of prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole of the film is to make some satire about the way white women 
perceive the sexual virility of the black man," Saleh said. "If the film were 
called 'How to Make Love to an Italian,' it would not be a problem. People 
would laugh at it." 
</P>
<P>
When author and screenplay co-writer Dany Laferriere heard of the NAACP 
protests, he said he wrote to the NAACP saying that their title -- the name of 
their organization -- was as bad as his. 
</P>
<P>
"It's completely laughable that they have the word 'colored' there," the 
French-speaking Laferriere said through an interpreter in a telephone 
interview. "I want them to read the book or see the movie first before they 
criticize the title. That which they don't understand is not my problem. They 
are very well-intentioned people . . . but this is censorship." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Black Media Coalition, a group of media professionals, business 
executives and others, has also protested the movie. Last August, when Angelika 
was about to sign a distribution deal, the group wrote Saleh to express its 
"deep distress and distaste" for the title. 
</P>
<P>
When Laemmle Theatres owner Robert Laemmle received a letter from the coalition 
asking him not to exhibit the film, he invited coalition members to see the 
film. "We play most of the foreign films," Laemmle said, so it is not unusual 
for his chain to book films of some controversy. "I did not find any problem 
with the film . . . I expressed a certain reservation with the title." 
</P>
<P>
The screening did not appease the coalition critics. 
</P>
<P>
"It really didn't matter to me what the movie was about," said coalition 
director Elaine Pounds, in an interview last week. "The title is offensive and 
the movie itself didn't change anything." 
</P>
<P>
"The word Negro doesn't bother me," she said. But the full title she found 
"divisive . . . it furthers a stereotype of black people. It really didn't have 
that much to do with the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Laferriere said he is "very surprised" at the uproar about the title, since the 
book has been out since 1985. It was meant to be amusing he said, adding that 
in a first draft he called it, "How to Make Love to a Negro When It's Raining 
and You've Got Nothing Else to Do." 
</P>
<P>
Some black circulation newspapers like the Los Angeles Sentinel and New York's 
Amsterdam News have rejected ads for the movie -- abbreviated or not. 
</P>
<P>
Sentinel advertising manager Preston Webster said he would reject any attempt 
to place an ad in his paper because, "I find it extremely offensive." 
</P>
<P>
Not all general-circulation newspapers are going for the abbreviated title. In 
San Francisco, the jointly run Chronicle and Examiner have run the full title 
and, according to Dean Leri, entertainment advertising representative for the 
papers, there have been few complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"When I received the ad," said Leri, "I figured that if we could mention the 
name of the movie in the reviews, then we would go ahead and run the title." 
</P>
<P>
Alternative newspapers such as the Village Voice and the L.A. Weekly have 
chosen to run ads using the full title. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Times said an advertising department panel 
determined the title to be in "questionable taste" for a family audience. The 
Times is publishing only the abbreviated version in its advertising columns. 
</P>
<P>
But in its news columns, The Times will publish the full title as necessary. 
Jeffrey S. Klein, assistant to The Times' Publisher David Laventhol, said the 
decision, "does seem at first blush to be inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the news columns is to publish the news as completely as 
possible," Klein said. "It would be impossible to cover this story without 
using the full title -- that is a compelling reason for including the name. 
There is no similar compelling reason to include the full name in the 
advertising which, in some ways, is more prominent than the words in a news 
story because there's a difference in the type face." 
</P>
<P>
The title was not a problem for the Watts Times, however. Marketing saleswoman 
Mary Ann Moore said that the weekly tabloid newspaper which primarily 
circulates in black South-Central Los Angeles, will publish the full name of 
the movie in its ads. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a satire and I think it's very funny. Why is everybody so up tight 
about it?" Moore asked. 
</P>
<P>
One thing no one has to worry about is people driving by the Fine Arts Theater 
in Beverly Hills, where the movie opens next week, and being offended by the 
title. All they will see is the shortened version, "How to Make Love." Said 
Laemmle: "The full title won't fit on the Fine Arts marquee."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Wednesday concert at the Country Club in Reseda and another Friday at the 
Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim are among 11 dates canceled by 2 Live Crew due to 
the "complete exhaustion" of leader Luther Campbell. The controversial act's 
Los Angeles publicist said that Campbell's Miami physician has "ordered 
complete rest" for the performer. The local dates are are expected to be 
rescheduled for November.

EAST BERLIN 'WALL' CONCERT: HIGHS OF THEATRICS AND HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was easily the most spectacular, ambitious, musical event ever staged, and 
for about half the 200,000 who crowded into Berlin's sweeping Potzdamer Platz 
to see former Pink Floyd leader Roger Waters' "The Wall," the production was 
nothing short of dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
For them, it was an emotional happening -- rock turned mega-theater with a 
message of hope as big as the 80-foot-high sets, all in a place dripping with 
history and symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
They floated home. 
</P>
<P>
But for the hapless remainder, either stuck behind speakers that weren't 
working, or else trying to take in a video relay running up to a full second 
out of sync with the sound, it was an over-priced fireworks show with a few 
whiffs of music thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
They might as well have been in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
For many of those stuck a couple of hundred yards back from the stage (that's 
an eighth of a mile, by the way), the only sounds they wanted to applaud were 
the chants of "louder, louder" from frustrated people who had forked out the 
equivalent of $30 and were getting little for it. 
</P>
<P>
For them, the only hope is to join that part of the estimated 1 billion global 
television audience that will eventually see a taped version of the event. 
</P>
<P>
(According to present plans, Americans will see the concert as part of an early 
fall network offering.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite these snafus, the sheer power of Saturday's performance of "The Wall" 
catapulted rock music into a new social dimension. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, that will be its legacy. 
</P>
<P>
In the London Live Aid and Nelson Mandela concerts, modern music became a 
vehicle for heightening social consciousness and generating money to right 
terrible wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Wall" continued this tradition, launching an equally worthy charity -- the 
Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief -- on its billion-dollar way. 
</P>
<P>
But it also did more than that. 
</P>
<P>
For "The Wall" was not just a gathering of sensational acts strutting their 
stuff for a good cause. 
</P>
<P>
It was a production, with a beginning, a middle, an end and a message to tear 
down the walls that divide individuals, all staged in what was until eight 
months ago 35 acres of no-man's-land behind a real wall, the Berlin Wall, that 
separated East from West for nearly three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of watchtowers with armed guards watching over a 200-yard wide "death 
strip," there were new towers, with stage spotlights. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time since the words East and West became political terms, 
Waters filled this no-man's-land with a sea of people from both sides, and the 
image of this, like the production itself, probably will be captured far more 
effectively by television. 
</P>
<P>
In a very real way, with Saturday's concert Waters finished work begun by the 
Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson and U2, who all performed near the Berlin Wall 
so those locked into the East could hear, even if they couldn't come. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was the U2 concert a few years ago that first rang alarm bells 
within East Germany's then-decaying Communist regime as crowds of youths, who 
had come near the wall to listen, fought police and chanted anti-government 
slogans in what was then an unprecedented display of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
Half of Saturday's concert-goers may have been disappointed, but the chances 
are that the majority of the 1 billion TV viewers will not. 
</P>
<P>
For those who could see and hear, it was a superlative affair. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a special feeling there," said Timothy Morton, an American in his 
mid-20s who had planned his European vacation around the concert and was near 
the front of the crowd. "People were thinking about what was happening on 
stage, really thinking about it. I never expected that." 
</P>
<P>
Added Leonard Cheshire, who heads the disaster relief fund: "It was 
unbelievable. I felt the audience had a sense of history, that it was more than 
just a concert. It was in Potzdamer Platz -- an historic place and an historic 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The building and smashing of the massive, 550-foot-long wall (which doubled as 
the world's biggest projection screen for a mixture of clever computer graphics 
and disturbing war footage), the sinister 40-to-50-foot-high puppets looming 
over the wall, Waters' own arrival in a white stretch Cadillac with a Hell's 
Angels escort, the appearance of a Soviet military band, the breathtaking 
lighting and other special effects plus the fireworks finale all set "The Wall" 
apart as such a one-of-a-kind production so unique that it overwhelmed many of 
those performing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so scared I was crying before I went out there," said Cyndi Lauper, who 
did the second of three versions of the show's best-known song, "Another Brick 
in the Wall." "I've never done anything like this before." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Carrack, who followed with "Hey You" to start the second act, had a 
similar reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually don't get nervous, but I was scared stiff," he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mick Worwood, who conceived and produced the show, described himself as 
"numbed to see it all finally happening." 
</P>
<P>
For much of the evening, it was a visual rather than musical spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarists Snowy White and Rick DeFonzo helped push the music back into the 
forefront with solos in "Comfortably Numb," while a bundle of talent, including 
Joni Mitchell, Sinead O'Connor, Bryan Adams, Van Morrison and Carrack gave the 
concert its emotional, upbeat finale, "The Tide Is Turning" -- performed amid 
the wall's wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
"This was no celebrity parade, it was a theatrical event, it was rock opera," 
said Robin Merrill, a popular deejay for the British Forces Broadcasting 
Service (BFBS), which transmits in Berlin. " 'The Wall' was written over 10 
years ago, but it's still valid, it's a helluva thing." 
</P>
<P>
But if Waters produced some dazzling special effects and extended the social 
dimensions of his art, the technical problems may have helped define its 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
Giving a crowd of 200,000 its money's worth at a concert may simply be asking 
too much, even of the most modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
The show also skidded to a halt briefly when a rack of circuit breakers blew 
after the opening number, and sound from Friday's dress rehearsal was 
substituted. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost about three tunes," said a clearly exhausted Waters after the 
performance. "It was a one-in-a-million thing." 
</P>
<P>
A perfectionist by reputation, Waters described himself as "deflated and 
depressed about the way things went. I'm sorry for the crew because they worked 
so hard to make it go right." 
</P>
<P>
He indicated his desire to see the production done without flaws had already 
started him thinking about mulling the prospects of doing "The Wall" again. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, we'll see," he said. "I'd certainly like to get through it 
without the problems."

"Into the Night Starring Rick Dees" is for people who find "The Arsenio Hall 
Show" too deep and complex. 
</P>
<P>
With lots of skin from leggy announcer Lisa Canning, nightly music from Billy 
Vera and the Beaters, and noisy support from a studio audience that would hoot 
and cheer even for Dr. Mengele, KIIS-FM super deejay Dees is now starting his 
second week as ABC's late-night hope (midnight on Channel 7). 
</P>
<P>
He opened chaotically, with a week of the terrible zanies. 
</P>
<P>
Having also predicted dire things for Arsenio (whose nationally syndicated show 
airs locally on KCOP Channel 13), I don't exactly come from great strength here 
and, for all anyone knows, Dees may thrive on ABC into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is hard to identify the audience ABC is going after with this 
series that some network affiliates are delaying even past its midnight time 
slot. Is it the make-me-laugh-with-sophomoric-jokes-after-"Nightline" audience? 
The stay-up-all-night-16-year-old audience? The 
we-love-Rick-Dees-no-matter-how-dumb-his-show-is audience? The I-remember-Ernie 
Kovacs- but-not-well-enough-to-know-that-Dees-is-a-very-bad-imitation audience? 
</P>
<P>
You have to admire Dees' energy and persistence. The former "Solid Gold" host 
is involved in nearly every on-camera aspect of his show, from interviewing to 
taking part in silly comedy bits to introducing -- and then salivating over -- 
the rockers and rappers who turn his studio audience into a screaming mob. 
</P>
<P>
And "Into the Night" does try to be at least somewhat off center. There's an 
aptly named "wall of shame" that guests are asked to sign before pressing the 
flesh with the studio audience. Dumb but different. Every so often, moreover, a 
Dees interview with one of the show's company of not-quite-off-the-wall 
characters yields a laugh. What's more, there's the occasional satire that 
doesn't drag interminably, as in a funny one that was titled "Julie Andrews 
Sings Paula Abdul." 
</P>
<P>
But puleeeeeeze. 
</P>
<P>
Dees is quick enough and has some skills as a counterpunching ad-libber. He is, 
however, a terrible monologist and is awkward and unfunny when it comes to 
participating in the show's set pieces. 
</P>
<P>
He's had some decent guests: Ed Begley Jr. and Smokey Robinson, for example. 
But as an interviewer, Dees is a cross between Arsenio and Merv, tending to 
fawn a lot and lean forward from the edge of his seat as if poised to hug. As 
with most every other talk-type show on the television map, moreover, his 
interviews are the kind where lips move without anything being said, and where 
the ultimate purpose is to spit out a few words and get to the movie clip. 
</P>
<P>
It's highly possible that the predatory jaws of late-night will chew up and 
spit out Dees just as they did "The Pat Sajak Show" on CBS and infinite other 
pretenders. Like surfers and boaters who continue to venture to sea despite 
knowing a giant maneater lurks there, however, still more late-nighters are on 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
Starting tonight on CBS (12:40 a.m. on Channels 2 and 8) is "The Midnight 
Hour," a talk show tentatively scheduled to last eight weeks, holding down the 
time period until what the network says is its permanent late-night schedule of 
first-run comedy and adventure programs is ready. Joy Behar will host the first 
week of "The Midnight Hour," Peter Tilden the second. 
</P>
<P>
And what's left for Dees? Radio is what's left. 
</P>
<P>
"The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" has taken some hits for being bland and 
politically conservative in its choice of interview subjects. Yet no newscast 
anywhere has a greater resource than this PBS program does in Nina Totenberg, 
whose primary job is as public affairs correspondent for National Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
Totenberg gave one of her typical performances Friday in explaining a federal 
appeals court's decision overturning one of three felony convictions against 
former Marine Col. Oliver North growing out of the Iran-Contra case, and 
referring the other two back to federal Judge Gerhard A. Gesell for rehearing. 
</P>
<P>
There was none of the posturing that one often gets from a network 
correspondent stiffly facing the camera outdoors, with some massive federal 
edifice looming in the background. Typcially, Totenberg gave meaning to 
something dry and complex, separating the significant from the superfluous. 
Sitting with co-anchor Jim Lehrer, she calmly, casually and conversationally 
explained the decision and its likely ramifications in language so clear and 
simple that any ordinary schlub (including this one) could understand. 
</P>
<P>
That's a real reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Attacking CNN for its hiring of a Texas judge named Catherine Crier to 
co-anchor its prime newscast -- as some TV critics did at a meeting in Los 
Angeles recently -- misses the point. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Crier won't be one of those traveling anchors, parachuted in to 
big stories merely to impress viewers by getting her mug on camera in some hot 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
For another, if CNN's news coverage has suffered because of Crier being 
untrained as a journalist, that hasn't been noticeable. On the contrary, Crier 
has made herself into a competent and professional newsreader, putting to rest 
the fable that a journalistic background is required for news anchoring. In 
almost all cases, good communicating is all that's required. 
</P>
<P>
Along with looking like a journalist.

A father and his two young sons died in a fast-moving fire in their Long Beach 
apartment despite rescue attempts that were thwarted by a wrought-iron gate 
blocking the front door, officials said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Two reserve police officers saw smoke coming from the apartment building on 
East 11th St. at 8:11 p.m. Sunday and tried unsuccessfully to enter the 
apartment, said Long Beach Fire Department Lt. Doug Sarvis. Firefighters 
arrived minutes later and broke into the apartment, pulling the three victims 
from the flaming unit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Lyles, 29, and Jamal Lyles, 4, died at the scene. Another son, Curtis 
Lyles Jr., 7, died at St. Mary Medical Center. The fire was believed to be 
accidental.

An unexpectedly severe plunge in stock prices spooked Wall Street today, as the 
Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 100 points before regaining some 
lost ground on one of the most volatile trading days this year. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the behavior of the nation's best-known stock average, which 
flirted with a record close of 3,000 last week but weakened late Friday, was a 
disturbing signal about the health of the market and the broader economy. 
</P>
<P>
"It just scared the hell out of everyone," said John Eberley, head of equity 
trading at the Chicago Corp. "It caught our attention." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 56.44 points to 2,904.70. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 225 up, 1,409 down and 382 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 209.03 million shares, against 177.81 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
"There was panic without a doubt," said Chung Lew, head trader at Kleinwort 
Benson North America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow average had plunged more than 100 points early in the day, regained 
about 35 points, dropped again and continued to seesaw. By 3:30 p.m. it was 
still down about 66 points from Friday at the 2,894 level. 
</P>
<P>
"It went from sell to buy to sell again just between 9:30 and 11," said Leigh 
Stevens, a strategist at PaineWebber Inc. "It's unusual to see such 
back-and-forth like that in such a short time span." 
</P>
<P>
As money was flowing out of stocks, it flowed into the bond market, where 
prices on long-term Treasuries rose after an early decline. Investors often 
flee to the relative safety of fixed-rate securities, such as Treasury bonds, 
when stocks decline. 
</P>
<P>
The severity of the stock market drop was intensified by computerized 
strategies known as program trading, which can dump enormous amounts of shares 
on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The swift selloff caused a brief automatic halt in the Standard &amp; Poor's 
500 stock-index futures contract, an important influence on stock prices, 
traded in the Chicago futures markets. 
</P>
<P>
The halt was triggered by a "circuit-breaker" mechanism put in place by the 
financial markets in the wake of the crash of Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow 
average fell a record 508 points. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers blamed the market's latest weakness on a number of causes, ranging from 
disappointing corporate earnings reports of leading U.S. companies, to the 
uncertain outlook for interest rates and the economy, to the abrupt fall in 
Tokyo stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said investors were bothered by a report in The Wall Street 
Journal this morning about the prospect of financial collapse for the largest 
guarantor of student loans in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Other brokers said the Dow drop was a symptom of the market's performance in 
recent days. They said the average showed signs of weakness in the last several 
trading sessions as it struggled unsuccessfully to close above the 3,000 mark.

Marlon Brando's son said he killed his half-sister's boyfriend in the actor's 
house during a struggle that began when the boyfriend "went nuts," a police 
officer testified today. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando said the fatal shot was fired accidentally as the two men 
wrestled over a handgun kept in the actor's Hollywood Hills mansion for family 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
"(Christian Brando) said he wasn't sure who was trying to shoot who," Officer 
Steve Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham was the first witness called at the preliminary hearing to determine 
whether Brando, 32, will stand trial for murder in the death May 16 of Dag 
Drollet. 
</P>
<P>
Drollet, 26, son an influential political figure in Tahiti, was the boyfriend 
of Cheyenne Brando, who recently gave birth to his child in Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Brando watched the testimony from the front row of Municipal Court Judge 
Larry Fidler's courtroom. Defense attorneys said the actor -- who was at home 
at the time of the shooting but did not witness it -- will not testify at his 
son's preliminary hearing.

WEST COAST CITIES, CHEVRON CITED FOR 'DIRTY' GASOLINE

West Coast cities have the "dirtiest" gasoline in the country and Chevron 
nationwide sells the gasoline with the highest average levels of cancer-causing 
benzene, an environmental group said today. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Citizen Action, released a study saying Seattle, Los Angeles and San 
Francisco consistently were among the cities where unleaded gasoline had the 
greatest average concentrations of benzene as well as highly toxic chemicals 
called aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene and xylene. 
</P>
<P>
Boston and Atlanta were also rated poorly in the study, which was based on a 
survey of gasoline in 18 cities conducted by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers 
Assn. in the summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 oil companies covered by the study, Chevron was singled out for 
selling gasoline with the highest average benzene content nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen Action officials said they hoped that their study will be used by 
consumers to avoid the most contaminated brands and fuel blends, both for 
environmental and health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the oil industry nor Chevron officials had any immediate comment on the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
The study comes as Congress is acting on clean air legislation that would set 
limits on benzene levels in the new cleaner-burning "reformulated" gasolines 
now being developed by several oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
Benzene is emitted in auto exhaust, but the main threat to motorists comes in 
the form of gasoline vapors released during refueling. The Environmental 
Protection Agency estimates that motorists face an eight in 100,000 chance of 
getting cancer from lifetime exposure to benzene emissions at the pump. 
</P>
<P>
Aromatic hydrocarbons cause a wide variety of toxic effects, ranging from liver 
and kidney damage to birth defects, and also promote urban smog. Clean air 
legislation would regulate levels of those chemicals in gasoline as well. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen Action officials said they believed that West Coast cities fared the 
worst because refineries in that region cannot find other markets for benzene 
and aromatic hydrocarbons and, thus, simply dumped them into their fuel blends. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, they said, Gulf Coast refiners can sell benzene and aromatic 
hydrocarbons to local chemical plants that need those substances to manufacture 
petrochemical products.

ALASKA FIRES CHAR OVER MILLION ACRES

The 121 fires reported across central Alaska had charred more than 1 million 
acres of timber and tundra by today, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety fire crews, more than 2,600 people, were hampered by continued warm, dry 
weather and dense smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Crews were focusing on just a few of the fires, said Trish Hogervorst-Rukke, a 
spokeswoman with the Alaska Fire Information Center in Fairbanks. "They're 
concentrating on the fires threatening structures," she said today. 
</P>
<P>
Many firefighting crews had been released earlier as scattered showers and 
cooler temperatures dampened many of the state's fires. But the crews are 
returning because of the dry weather and highs in the 80s. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been injured and few dwellings have been lost, officials said. Most 
of the fires have been caused by lightning.

The CIA today denied involvement in Italian terrorism and the assassination of 
Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme as investigations into allegations of the 
agency's role got under way in Sweden and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"The allegations . . . regarding involvement in terrorist activities in Italy 
or the Palme assassination are absolute nonsense," CIA spokesman Peter Earnest 
said in a phone call to Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA denied claims made by an Oregon businessman named Dick Brenneke, who 
said on Italian state television this month that the U.S. spy agency backed the 
P-2 Masonic Lodge in committing terrorist acts in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The television reports said another purported ex-CIA operative maintained that 
P-2 got CIA support for the Palme assassination. 
</P>
<P>
"The agency flatly denies that Mr. Brenneke was ever an agent of the CIA or had 
any association with the CIA," Earnest said. "We repeat this public denial 
because of the outrageous nature of his claims."

OPPOSITION LAWMAKERS IN S. KOREA RESIGN EN MASSE

Opposition lawmakers resigned en masse today, demanding new elections and 
accusing President Roh Tae Woo of using sensitive inter-Korea issues to divert 
attention from pressing domestic problems. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations of all 79 opposition members in the 299-member National 
Assembly could throw the country into political crisis as it prepares for the 
first meeting ever between the prime ministers of North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The Roh government announced today that it was willing to negotiate with the 
Communist North on conditions the North is setting for opening the border 
between the Koreas to travelers. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea today proposed expanded high-level talks among government and 
political leaders of the two sides Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae Jung, head of the leading opposition Party for Peace and Democracy, 
said his party welcomed efforts for border openings with North Korea. But he 
said Roh should not use the issue to bolster what he called sagging support for 
the governing Democratic Liberal Party. 
</P>
<P>
The mass resignations from Parliament included 71 members of Kim's party and 
eight members from the splinter Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators cleaned out their offices and said they and their staffs would 
refuse further government paychecks as of today. 
</P>
<P>
They said they would not return unless the governing party agrees to discuss 
their demands, including new elections. They also want 26 controversial bills 
that were pushed through the legislature at a special session earlier this 
month returned to committee. 
</P>
<P>
Roh's party was a minority party in Parliament until it merged in January with 
two smaller groups, giving it a two-thirds majority. The opposition says the 
legislature's makeup no longer reflects the wishes of voters and new elections 
must be held. 
</P>
<P>
The governing party said the resignations would not be immediately accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers said they considered themselves finished with Parliament 
nevertheless, regardless of how the resignations are dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, anti-government protesters clashed with police after a huge 
opposition rally that attracted an estimated 300,000 people. Fighting broke out 
when riot police firing tear gas blocked a column of about 20,000 radical 
students chanting anti-government slogans. 
</P>
<P>
Police said 195 protesters were arrested. There were no reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The rally had been called to celebrate talks to unify the two opposition 
parties with a nationwide dissident group by September. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean peninsula was divided into the pro-Western south and Communist north 
at the end of World War II.

ASPIN GIVES BOOST TO HOUSE B-2 FOES, ASKS HALT IN PRODUCTION

<P>
The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee today announced he will 
oppose future production of the B-2 bomber, giving a major boost to House 
efforts to kill the aircraft President Bush has sought. 
</P>
<P>
"Production of the B-2 should be stopped and the production facility should be 
mothballed. Research and development should be continued and completed," Rep. 
Les Aspin (D-Wis.) said in a speech on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin cited the increasing fiscal constraints on the defense budget as the 
basis for his decision. The chairman noted that five strategic programs -- the 
B-2 bomber, the C-17 transport plane, the Advanced Tactical Fighter, the A-12 
attack plane and the light helicopter -- will cost more than $300 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the cost of a single B-2 bomber is estimated at nearly $860 
million, a price tag that has caused sticker shock among members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer to the question of whether the B-2 will be as stealthy and 
otherwise work as advertised is: The early results are good, but we just don't 
know yet," Aspin said. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, the Armed Services Committee chairman said the program 
turned up no "unique and compelling mission for the B-2." 
</P>
<P>
In proposing a $307-billion defense budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 
1, Bush called for $5.5 billion for five of the radar-evading aircraft and 
related items. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a diminishing Soviet threat and a burgeoning federal deficit, 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in April revised the Administration's request to 
two planes in fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also cut the total number of planes to built from 132 to 75 at a total 
cost of $63 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin's announcement is certain to help legislation sponsored by Reps. Ronald 
V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), John G. Rowland (R-Conn.) and John R. Kasich (R-Ohio) 
to stop production of the planes at the 15 currently in development.

<P>
In his speech, Aspin said he would incorporate the Dellums-Kasich-Rowland 
amendment in his proposal to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the legislation failed in the House by a vote of 279 to 144, largely 
because Aspin opposed the bill and joined forces with Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) 
on a compromise bill that scaled back the program. 
</P>
<P>
The Aspin-Synar amendment was approved 257 to 160. 
</P>
<P>
Although proponents of the House measure are optimistic they can kill the 
program, support for the bat-winged aircraft in the Senate remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Armed Services Committee, in approving a $289-billion defense bill 
earlier this month, approved the Administration's request for two planes in 
fiscal 1991 and the panel's chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) remains a strong 
supporter of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin's decision comes as his panel is scheduled to begin crafting their 
version of the defense bill for fiscal 1991. The committee will draw up a 
budget to a total of $283 billion, $24 billion less than Bush proposed.

A prescription drug taken by thousands of Americans to control epileptic 
seizures is in short supply in at least four states, including California, 
company officials confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss drug manufacturer, said 
higher-than-expected demand and manufacturing problems have created spot 
shortages of carbamazepine, which is sold under the brand name Tegretol. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have a shortage," said Cathy Kernen, a spokeswoman at the company's 
offices in Summit, N.J. "We hope not for long, but we're afraid to say at this 
point how long. It might be a couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
Shortages of the drug have occurred most frequently in the last two months in 
Texas, Ohio, Indiana and parts of California, Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
She said Ciba-Geigy's current shortage is due to equipment problems at a Swiss 
plant where the active ingredient for Tegretol is made.

A student and a bricklayer who claimed to have explosives tried to hijack a 
domestic flight to Sweden today, but the jet's crew apparently didn't believe 
them and they were arrested, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no bombs, no weapons, nothing," Mikhail Timofeyev, the deputy 
minister of civil aviation, said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The two tried to hijack an Aeroflot Tupolev-134 with 74 passengers that was en 
route to the Arctic port of Murmansk from the Latvian capital of Riga, 
Timofeyev said. The crew decided to land at Petrozavodsk, 150 miles north of 
Leningrad, the Tass news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Security officials arrested the two passengers, who were identified only as 
Kovalenko, 22, a vocational training student, and Kuznetsov, a 27-year-old 
bricklayer. 
</P>
<P>
Five young Soviet men hijacked five airliners to Sweden and Finland in June and 
July. They surrendered to police and said they wanted to stay in the Nordic 
countries. Sweden extradited one of the men to the Soviet Union last week.

Britain's balance of payments deficit rose slightly in June to almost $2.5 
billion after a gap of $2.4 billion in May, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The increase was in line with forecasts, and financial markets generally took 
the view that the government was still moving in the right direction to narrow 
the gap. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office data showed the merchandise trade balance for 
June was almost $2.8 billion in the red compared with a shortfall of just over 
$2.8 billion in May. 
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit was offset by a $363-million surplus on so-called invisible 
items such as shipping, insurance and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
With a stronger pound making imports cheaper and exports more expensive, the 
fact that the increase was within expectations brought relief to financial 
markets, and the pound rose a third of a cent against the dollar to $1.8180 at 
midday.

Gonzalez, who had staff investigators in New York last week, has asked bank 
regulators and Trump lenders to testify at the hearings, to begin Aug. 9.

<P>
Citicorp, the nation's biggest bank group and a Trump lender, has been asked to 
testify, according to one source, and Chase Manhattan Corp., also involved with 
Trump, may be summoned as well.

In addition, Trump and representatives of the Trump Organization will be asked 
to appear, a committee spokesman said.

GAP BETWEEN U.S. RICH, POOR RISES SHARPLY

<P>
The gap between rich and poor widened so much in the 1980s that the richest 1% 
receive nearly as much of Americans' total income after taxes as do the bottom 
40%, a liberal research group said today. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom 40% will receive 14.2% of total after-tax income received by all 
groups this year, while the top 1% will receive 12.6%, the Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"This marks a sharp change from 1980, when the top 1% received half as much 
after-tax income as the bottom 40%," according to the report, which was based 
on an analysis of Congressional Budget Office data on income and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The share of income going to those Americans in the middle of the income scale 
is lower than at any time since the end of World War II, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said the richest 2.5 million people have nearly as much total 
income as the 100 million Americans with the lowest incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Greenstein, executive director of the center, said the changes were due 
in part to increased income from capital gains received by the wealthy. The 
findings, he said, were an argument against President Bush's call for a cut in 
the tax on capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the vast bulk of capital gains income goes to the very wealthy, they 
would receive most of the benefits from a reduction in taxes on capital gains," 
Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and other advocates of cutting the capital-gains tax say it would provide 
an added incentive for people to invest in job-creating new and expanded 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the most affluent Americans received large income gains during 
the '80s, while middle-income people gained little and the poor fell behind.

STUDENT LOAN GUARANTOR IN 'URGENT' FINANCIAL CRISIS

<P>
The Education Department said today it is holding daily meetings in an effort 
to resolve a financial crisis at one of the nation's largest guarantors of 
student loans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of urgency," department spokeswoman Etta Fielek said after a 
morning session on problems at the Higher Education Assistance Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit corporation, based in Overland Park, Kan., guarantees nearly $10 
billion in student loans. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation has notified the department that "it is facing serious financial 
problems," Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said in a statement late last 
week. He said the department is considering various options that would "ensure 
the availability of new loans and the continuation of guarantees and claim 
payments on outstanding loans." 
</P>
<P>
Fielek said HEAF has asked Congress and the department to approve a federally 
assisted takeover by another guarantor, the Nebraska Student Loan Program Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But she said the department is apprehensive about that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a problem of scale," Fielek said. "There's concern on the part of the 
department that Nebraska would be too small an operation to consume something 
the magnitude of HEAF." 
</P>
<P>
There are 55 guarantors responsible for repaying banks in the event of defaults 
on student loans. HEAF is a national guarantor operating in many states, while 
Nebraska operates in only one state. 
</P>
<P>
The student loan program will make a projected $13 billion in loans this year 
and has $51 billion in loans outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report today in The Wall Street Journal, HEAF expects a cash 
shortfall of $50 million to $100 million in the next 12 months.

RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. today reported that it lost $108 million in the 
second quarter, an improvement from a year earlier when it had a 66% larger 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The shortfall reflected interest payments and other costs related to the record 
$24.53-billion leveraged buyout of the food and tobacco giant last year. 
</P>
<P>
RJR Nabisco's red ink in the three months ended June 30 compared to a loss of 
$319 million in the second 1989 quarter. The latest loss was also narrower than 
the $222-million shortfall posted in this year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Second-quarter sales rose 5% to $3.46 billion from $3.30 billion the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, expressed 
satisfaction with the company's performance and said both food and tobacco 
operations and margins continue to improve across the board.

The nonstop action in "Die Hard 2" may have been too much for Kami Core, who 
went into labor midway through the movie and gave birth 20 minutes later in the 
theater restroom. 
</P>
<P>
Core, 18, wasn't particularly concerned going to the theater Saturday since she 
wasn't due for almost two months. 
</P>
<P>
But about halfway through the action thriller, Core began feeling labor pains. 
She went to the restroom, where paramedics were summoned. About 20 minutes 
later, she gave birth to Cortney Brion Samuels on the restroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
Seven weeks premature, the infant and her mother were taken to Kennestone 
Hospital. Core was to be released Monday but Cortney won't go home for another 
two weeks.

"Stuff like that happens on television, but it never happens in real life,"

NEA ADVISERS TO CLOSE MOST OF AUGUST MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently fearing public disclosure, the advisory board to the National 
Endowment for the Arts plans to meet in closed session for most of an impending 
three-day meeting at which controversy over politically troublesome grants is 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled for Aug. 3-5 at NEA headquarters in Washington. 
Documents obtained by The Times today indicate the council will hold more than 
half of its announced meetings in private. Members will also attend two closed 
social events -- including a confidential dinner preceding the meeting at which 
significant amounts of NEA business have traditionally been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the situation say the proportion of private discussions at 
next month's meeting appeared significant, since the council is expected to 
engage in potentially confrontational debate over a decision by NEA Chairman 
John E. Frohnmayer last month to deny fellowship grants to four performance 
artists, after he reportedly polled the advisory group. 
</P>
<P>
The performers -- who have been dubbed "the NEA Four" by one national artist 
group -- have all demanded formal appeals of the grant rejections. It was 
learned that at least one member of the National Council on the Arts intends to 
attempt a formal reopening of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The other potentially troublesome issues that are expected to be included on 
next month's agenda are: 
</P>
<P>
* An initiative to reconsider a controversial vote taken by the national 
council in May that denied two of three grants to the University of 
Pennsylvania's Institute for Contemporary Art. The institute was the original 
organizer of a controversial endowment-supported show of photographs by the 
late Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
* A possible move to reconsider a council vote in May to open grant review 
meetings to the public. 
</P>
<P>
* A recommendation that two of "the NEA Four" receive grants this year from an 
NEA program that fosters the work of artists working in especially progressive 
art forms and media.

<P>
Where does the National Enquirer get all those wild stories about Roseanne 
Barr? Some of them came from an unlikely paid informant -- Barr's husband, Tom 
Arnold, according to one of the tabloid's reporters. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on "Geraldo" that will air Wednesday, reporter Brian Williams 
said, "Tom was eager to, shall we say, earn a little extra money in his own 
right so he helped us on a number of stories. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, before they were getting married, he, in a macho way, wanted to 
pay for his own honeymoon. Of course, Roseanne makes millions and millions of 
dollars and Tom was barely surviving as a stand-up comedian. So he sold us a 
series of stories in the hope of being able to pay for their honeymoon." 
</P>
<P>
Enquirer General Editor Steve Coz described Barr as a tabloid journalist's 
dream. "She's crazy and everyone around her is crazy and they love to talk to 
tabloids," he said. "So you just get story after story about her."

Actor Sylvester Stallone says he will flex his brain more than his biceps in 
films. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone, 44, who rose to prominence with the original "Rocky" film about an 
underdog fighter, said in this week's People magazine that audiences cannot 
identify with the kind of super-hero he portrayed in "Rambo III." 
</P>
<P>
"I recently saw 'Rambo III' again and recoiled at a scene where, strong and 
invulnerable, I stood up there. I mean, I was so invincible, I had veins in my 
hair. There I was, superhuman, with my gun obliterating everyone crossing my 
path," Stallone said. 
</P>
<P>
He said filmmakers need to place more emphasis on developing characters. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we don't care about dialogue. We know it's just a boring interlude 
before the action starts."

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ONIONS, IF NOT TOBACCO, CAN RELIEVE PAIN OF BEE STINGS

Question: At our family reunion last week my little niece was stung by a yellow 
jacket. My dad said his father always swore by tobacco juice, but no one at the 
gathering was chewing tobacco. Someone tried soaking a cigarette and squeezing 
the juice on the sting, but that didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't there some other home remedy that would work to take away the pain of a 
sting? 
</P>

Answer: In our part of the country tobacco juice is an old home remedy for bee 
stings too, but we've never seen any scientific data to show if this works. 
</P>
<P>
But one of our readers came up with a home remedy for stings that really took 
our breath away. He credits his German neighbor lady with suggesting that a cut 
onion be applied to the sting for at least 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
When we checked with the world-renowned onion researcher, Dr. Eric Block of the 
State University of New York at Albany, he confirmed that a fresh-cut onion may 
minimize the pain. Onions contain an ingredient that can break down the 
chemicals responsible for inflammation and discomfort.

Q: I will be attending my 25th class reunion next month and I am feeling 
embarrassed about my weight. I weigh 12 pounds more now than I did at the last 
reunion, and my classmates made fun of me then. 
</P>
<P>
I came across a diet pill that promised I could lose up to five pounds a week. 
The ingredient is guar gum. What is it and how does it work? 
</P>
<P>
A: Guar gum is a soluble fiber from guar seeds. Like the fiber in oat bran and 
pectin, guar gum has been shown to lower cholesterol and perhaps even improve 
blood sugar levels in diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
There is controversy, however, about whether guar gum actually promotes weight 
loss. Although you might have a feeling of fullness after consuming this fiber, 
you should not expect to lose a lot of weight in a short period of time.

LIZ SMITH: HOPES ARISE FOR NEW EMERGENCE OF LIZA IN FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIZA MINNELLI is off to Toronto in early September to begin a new film for 
Paramount titled "Stepping Out." In this one -- based on a British play -- Liza 
portrays a tap dance instructor. Lewis Gilbert will direct. Her co-stars are to 
be Shelley Winters, Ellen Greene, Andrea Martin and Bill Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
This is just great news. For as electrifying as Liza Minnelli is on stage, in 
concert, here is a woman made for the movies. It is unfortunate that Hollywood 
has never really known what to do with Liza's oversized talent. Only "Cabaret" 
for which she won the Oscar, and Martin Scorsese's "New York, New York" were 
able to showcase not only her dazzling musical abilities, but the sensitivity 
and wry humor of her acting. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the '90s will see a new emergence of Liza on screen. 
</P>
<P>
On the personal side, Liza has triumphed unconditionally. She fought her demons 
and won, becoming a role model of willpower and determination. This in the face 
of a press and public that perversely seemed to expect, no, demand that Liza 
self-destruct. She has made a great success of her marriage to sculptor Mark 
Gero, against daunting odds. It hasn't been 11 years of wedded bliss. It's been 
years of working overtime on a relationship that both of them obviously care 
about deeply. Neither one took the easy way out by throwing up their hands and 
saying, "I can't handle this!" They kept it together. For the strong and 
graceful handling of her personal life alone, Liza should take great and 
justifiable pride. 
</P>
<P>
Liza Minnelli in the '90s. The best is yet to be. 
</P>
<P>
MANDY PATINKIN, currently on screen in "Dick Tracy" as 88 Keys, will soon be 
back on stage. He's just been signed to star in Peter Hall's new musical "Born 
Again," based on the Eugene Ionesco play "Rhinoceros." "Born Again" opens in 
London this fall with an eye on Broadway for the summer 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Patinkin also has a new album from Columbia coming out around Christmas. It 
will include a number from William Finn's new musical "Falsettoland." 
</P>
<P>
DINAH SHORE, at a taping of her "Conversation With Dinah" TV show, recently 
asked veteran actor and fairly new author Kirk Douglas who he would like to 
have star in a movie version of his first book, the autobiography "The Ragman's 
Son." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk replied that ideally the film would involve his entire family: son Peter 
would produce, son Eric would play the "young" Kirk, and son Michael as the 
"midlife' Douglas. He'd play himself in more recent years. However, Kirk said 
he doesn't think he can afford Michael Douglas' salary, so maybe it won't be a 
family affair.

"Pretty Woman" actress Julia Roberts described her stay in these parts as 
boring and the people as racist. 
</P>
<P>
She stayed in Spartanburg and Abbeville, in the state's northwestern corner, 
during filming of "Sleeping With the Enemy" in May. 
</P>
<P>
"The people were horribly racist and I had a really hard time," Rolling Stone 
magazine quoted Roberts as saying in the Aug. 9 issue. 
</P>
<P>
"In Abbeville, I felt so assaulted and insulted by these people that I just 
didn't want to be nice anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Abbeville Mayor Joe Savitz said her remarks may stem from her attempt to take a 
black friend into a "real redneck-type place" that doesn't allow black 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"No self-respecting person would want to go there," Savitz said. 
</P>
<P>
In her latest movie, Roberts portrays an abused wife who stages her death and 
assumes a new identity. It is scheduled for release in February.

<P>
The NBA and its players association agreed today to a pre-pension benefit plan 
that will provide revenue for retired players between age 30 -- or one year 
after retirement -- and 50 when their regular pensions begin. 
</P>
<P>
The plan will be funded from the 53% of gross revenues which the league is 
committed to paying to the players each year and was made possible because of 
the growth of those gross revenues. 
</P>
<P>
It will not alter salary caps set at $11.7 million, $12.5 million, $13.3 
million and $14.2 million for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
The new program is designed as a mandatory savings plan with benefits 
calculated according to the number of years a player is in the league, his 
salary in relation to the salaries of all players, his age and the size of 
benefit pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Our players will be provided for," Commissioner David Stern said. "This is one 
area we have looked at wistfully over the years, to create a fund that would 
eliminate the specter of former NBA players who are destitute or short of 
living expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Each player receives approximately 8% of his salary as a contribution to the 
plan each year he plays, with the contributions above and beyond his regular 
salary.

ELBOW SURGERY FOR SABERHAGEN DEEMED A SUCCESS

<TEXT>
<P>
Two-time Cy Young winner Bret Saberhagen underwent successful arthroscopic 
surgery on his right elbow today, the Kansas City Royals announced. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Steven Joyce removed two loose fragments and reported that no ligament, 
tendon or nerve tissue was disturbed, the Royals said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to be back pitching in September," Saberhagen, a right-hander, said on 
Sunday. "Nobody has ever told me of any reason why I can't shoot for that 
target." 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen is 5-7 with a 3.10 ERA in 18 starts this year. He left his last 
start, on July 15 against Boston, after only four innings. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials said Saberhagen is expected to begin throwing in three to five 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen won the American League Cy Young last year after going 23-6 with a 
2.16 ERA. He also won the award in 1985 when he was 20-6, 2.87. 
</P>
<P>
His 1990 troubles have followed the inexplicable odd-even cycle of Saberhagen's 
career. In odd-numbered years since reaching the major leagues in 1984, 
Saberhagen has gone 20-6, 18-10 and 23-6. His records in even-numbered years 
are 10-11, 7-12, 14-16 and 5-7.

Chris Chandler, the Indianapolis Colts' unhappy quarterback, filed a lawsuit 
today seeking a $50,000 workout bonus he says the team owes him. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Marion County Court, also seeks to have his contract with 
the NFL team rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler reported for training camp Thursday at Anderson University but walked 
out the next day after the Colts refused to give him the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler claims he worked out at the Colts complex for the 16 weeks required to 
receive the bonus. However, Colts officials said he had not participated to the 
degree necessary to satisfy his contract, which called for workouts two hours a 
day for five days each week. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler's suit also seeks $5,000 for each day the bonus is unpaid, and 
attorneys fees. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler, who returned to his home in Seattle Friday, was starting quarterback 
for the Colts last season before being injured.

U. OF FLORIDA ADMITS 6 RULE VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The University of Florida acknowledged six major rules violations during an 
NCAA investigation but disputed an allegation that the infractions demonstrated 
a lack of institutional control of the school's football and basketball 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The university's response to an official letter of inquiry detailing 10 alleged 
violations concluded that five infractions were the result of conduct by 
coaches that could not be detected by the school's monitoring system "or any 
other compliance program." 
</P>
<P>
One other violation occurred because of a clerical error, the school said. 
</P>
<P>
A seventh infraction, one not included in the NCAA allegations, was 
self-reported and was linked to an apparent misunderstanding of NCAA 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Officials submitted the response to the NCAA last week but delayed making it 
public until today to give attorneys time to delete the names of students 
mentioned in 1,100 pages of documents. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA began investigating alleged wrongdoing in the football and basketball 
programs last year. The Southeastern Conference school received an official 
letter of inquiry detailing 10 alleged violations -- six of them considered 
major -- in May. 
</P>
<P>
Florida acknowledged allegations that former football Coach Galen Hall provided 
improper salary supplements to two assistant coaches and arranged the payment 
of child support for a former player. 
</P>
<P>
The school also acknowledged that former basketball Coach Norm Sloan arranged 
for an airline ticket for ex-Gator star Vernon Maxwell to attend a summer camp 
in Boston and that Maxwell hired an agent during his junior season and should 
have been ineligible to compete in the NCAA Tournament in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The response focused on reforms instituted in the athletic department in the 
last six years and emphasized the swift corrective action taken when violations 
were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Hall and Sloan were forced to resign last fall within a few weeks of one 
another. University President John V. Lombardi believes that hiring Steve 
Spurrier to head the football program and luring Lon Kruger from Kansas State 
to coach basketball also were moves that demonstrate Florida is headed in the 
right direction. 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi said earlier this month that the university's defense would address 
the most serious of the charges -- one alleging a lack of institutional control 
-- by demonstrating the safeguards built into the athletic department's 
monitoring system since 1984, when the NCAA placed Florida on probation for 
football infractions. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lombardi has acknowledged that the Gators could be candidates for the 
NCAA's so-called death penalty -- the temporary suspension of either or both 
sports -- he said he doesn't expect such punishment.

MELVIN DURSLAG: PETE ROSE DEDICATION TO GAME OF BASEBALL WAS NEARLY BEAUTIFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Wade Boggs, celebrated batsman for the Boston Red Sox, experienced his 
greatest embarrassment last year, he got a visit from his longtime hero, Pete 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs had been the subject of a series written in Penthouse magazine by a 
woman, revealing intimate details of her relationship with Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Wade wasn't eager for such details to be revealed, considering that he had a 
wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
Devastated, he now sat with Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, " Pete disclosed, "that the best way to handle the problem is to 
keep hitting .350. If you do that, the story will be forgotten faster than if 
you hit .250. There is something about .350 that makes the world forget 
everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Rose never hit .350, but this offers an insight on the outlook on life he 
embraced. He saw earthly problems vanish on the wind of base hits, times at 
bat, years of service. 
</P>
<P>
It was the childlike orbit in which he moved, impervious to marital crises, 
divorce, paternity suits and a gambling habit that would later bury him. 
</P>
<P>
Walking into Shea Stadium one night, Pete was nailed by a process server. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned my wife was divorcing me," he recounted. "I was so shaken I got only 
three hits that night. In my next 26 at bats, I got 17 hits. I got 52 for the 
month, most of my career." 
</P>
<P>
This was Pete Rose up until the time that life at last got serious. He was 
removed from baseball for betting and, the other day, got five months in prison 
for failing to pay income tax. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Pete in court, you got the feeling something else counted to him 
besides baseball records, although he still seemed to ask, as he has for a 
year, whether a flicker of hope remained for a shot at the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
That thought will occur to him daily at the slammer at Marion, Ill., where he 
will do his time. It will occur to him daily when he gets out, as it occurred 
to him daily since his arrival in baseball in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't seem possible that one could be consumed by anything as Pete has 
been by baseball, but it was doubtless this abnormality that drove him to 
achievements unmatched in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
He stunned you with figures, called up at will from his cerebral computer. 
Managing at Cincinnati three years ago, for instance, he dipped into the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to bat a record 14,053 times," he recalled, "But most people forget my 
1,566 walks, which don't show in the at-bats. I also figure I was hit by at 
least 100 pitches. That doesn't show in the at-bats, either. And what about 
sacrifices? I wasn't asked to sacrifice often, but we're talking at least 100, 
which don't show in the at bats." 
</P>
<P>
Named Player of the Decade for the 1970s, Pete was distressed when Henry Aaron 
lodged a complaint, contending that the vote should have gone to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to apologize to Henry," said Rose. "When was the last time a 
38-year-old played 163 games, as I did last season? (The 163rd was a makeup of 
a suspended game.) And when was the last time a 38-year-old got 51 hits in 
September and batted .421 for the month? I walked 95 times last year. I still 
got 208 hits, the 10th time I got 200 or more. I also stole 20 bases, including 
home." 
</P>
<P>
It always has been, and remains, Pete's contention that players today miss too 
many games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a state of mind," he told us. "Everyone gets aches and pains and everyone 
gets mentally fatigued. But some are more willing to play than others." 
</P>
<P>
"What's the solution?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If I owned a club, I would hang up a sign in the locker room that read, 'Note 
to regulars: If you play tonight, you get paid. If you don't play, no pay.' You 
would see how few games guys would miss." 
</P>
<P>
Managing the Reds, Pete admitted candidly that the thought processes of young 
players baffled him. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a guy who arrived at 8:10 for a 7:30 game," he said. "I fined him a 
game's pay -- $1,780. He offered no beef. He wrote a check calmly. I tore it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him: " I don't want your lousy money. I'm just trying to figure out how 
a guy can arrive at 8:10 for a 7:30 game. I played 24 years without missing a 
single batting practice. The closest I ever came to missing was when I arrived 
one time at 4:45 for batting practice that began at 5." 
</P>
<P>
These are the things on which one reflects who has known Pete a long, long 
time. His dedication, as deranged as it seemed, was almost a thing of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
You aren't going to whitewash one who cheats the government out of taxes. Nor 
are you going to excuse it because others cheat the government out of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
What you are trying to do is weigh -- specifically, his sins, as they pertain 
to baseball, against his virtues, pertaining to fanatical work and to 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
When Hall of Fame is mentioned, few entering the argument are on the fence. 
There is the hanging faction, and there is the faction able to forgive. 
</P>
<P>
Historians also enter the discussion, identifying rogues admitted to the Hall, 
including drunks, assault-and-battery guys and bum pay artists. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of sermonizing is heard from the anti-Rose element, but never having 
played the cornet in a missionary band and taking into consideration the unique 
nature of the case, we are able to tender a vote for Pete.

At first glance he might look out of place to the casual observer. The graying 
temples give him a distinguished look that not even a baseball uniform can 
hide. 
</P>
<P>
He stands on the top step of the dugout watching each pitch. Every move is 
charted in his mental computer. He is surrounded by kids younger than his own 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those charged to his care are Pete Rose II and Keith Kessinger, whose 
fathers played against him in the major leagues almost three decades ago. To 
him, a generation gap is nothing more than a difference in age. Tell him he 
looks, and sounds, like he could be a teacher and he will smile. The man has a 
master's degree in education from Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake about it, Wally Moon is a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
That's what brings him to the foothills of the Catoctin Mountains to manage a 
Single A baseball team. That's what enables him to endure bus rides that test 
the mental and physical endurance of men half his age. 
</P>
<P>
He is not a career minor-leaguer, like many in his profession. He has spent 
more time on college campuses than some professors. 
</P>
<P>
He has also spent most of his life on baseball diamonds. And, at the age of 60, 
he has no immediate plans to change his lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
This is Moon's first year as manager of the Frederick Keys, the Baltimore 
Orioles' Carolina League farm team. It is his first year in the organization, 
only the fifth year he has managed a minor-league team. 
</P>
<P>
What propels him to continue? What drives him to put on a uniform instead of 
packing a fishing pole? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm challenged by the teaching process," Moon said. "I'm interested in young 
people. I like to be around them, work with them, see them do things." 
</P>
<P>
Patience is a key to Moon's approach, dating back to his playing days. A 
left-handed hitter who came up with the Cardinals, he made an art of hitting to 
the opposite field after being traded to the Dodgers. He briefly played 
"screeno," hitting home runs over the left-field screen in the Los Angeles 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Moon disappeared from the professional scene when his playing career ended in 
1965, but he hardly reached this stage of his career by accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The children were growing up, drugs were starting to come on the scene, and I 
decided I didn't want to raise my family in Southern California," Moon said. He 
and his wife, Bettye, have five children. "I sought out a small school (John 
Brown University) in Arkansas and spent 15 years there as baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, something possessed Moon to get into the ownership end of professional 
baseball. "I bought the San Antonio team, with the idea that my son (Wally Joe) 
could run it after getting out of graduate school," he recalled. "But my 
general manager got promoted to a job in Rochester during the winter meetings 
and the next thing I knew the season was ready to start and I didn't have any 
program ads or tickets sold." To protect his interest, Moon ultimately got out 
of college coaching and took over operations of the San Antonio team. "Before I 
knew it, I was $250,000 in debt," he said. "It took me six years to get out." 
</P>
<P>
How long will he continue in baseball? 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I feel as good as I feel now, and somebody will give me a job," he 
said. I feel really good physically and mentally."

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: BOOKISH BETTOR KNOWS HOW TO READ THE HORSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Dr. Brent, running in the first race of the day on May 12 at Hollywood 
Park in a six-furlong sprint against 4-year-olds and up, jumped into third from 
the No. 1 post position, "Read" was sitting in his reserved seat in the 
Clubhouse and reading a book. 
</P>
<P>
At the quarter pole, Dr. Brent moved up to second and held his position until 
the stretch, where he suddenly made a bold move to take the lead. At the 
finish, Dr. Brent was two lengths in front of his second-place competition. 
</P>
<P>
Although Read had bet on the race, he continued reading until the prices were 
flashed on the totalizator board. Once he found that his horse had paid a $4.80 
mutuel, Read rose from his seat and headed for the betting windows to collect 
on his winning ticket. 
</P>
<P>
When Read visits the Southland race tracks, he never buys a tout sheet, a 
Racing Form or any of the many other papers and magazines that would help him 
choose a nag. He doesn't need them, because of the way he bets. And when he 
loses for the day, he'll generally make up his losses when he wins, coming out 
a little ahead or ending up even after the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
Read always walks around the Clubhouse at Hollywood Park with a book in hand, 
eyes downward, reading as he moves along slowly and carefully from his seat to 
the betting windows. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Read is so engrossed in his books that he starts reading as soon as he 
leaves his car in the parking lot, continues to read until he gets to the 
Clubhouse entrance, hands over his money and collects his change without 
looking up from his book, and enters the Clubhouse still reading. 
</P>
<P>
On the escalator that takes him to a higher level of the track he keeps on 
reading, and on his way to his seat his eyes never stray from the book. 
</P>
<P>
What is unusual about Read, easily recognizable with his shocking red hair and 
lanky figure (about 150 pounds and 6 feet, 5 inches tall), is that he never 
bumps into anyone. He makes his way past the bettors like a blind man being led 
by a guide dog. 
</P>
<P>
The people who know him, however, think that someday he will hit a person on 
the way to make a bet or cash in a ticket and will thereby end his record of 
never having bumped into an individual. They are so positive this will occur 
that they make wagers among themselves that it will happen. 
</P>
<P>
Although some people think Read is independently wealthy, since he never misses 
a day at the track unless he is ill, it is far from the truth, because Read is 
a librarian at a college in the Los Angeles area. His supervisors let him work 
out his own hours -- four in the morning and four in the evening, thus giving 
him time to visit the track in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
What Read does is bet a money-management progression that covers each race from 
the first to the sixth, whether he wins or loses, wagering $2 to win on the 
first race, $6 on the second, $10 on the third, $16 on the fourth, $22 on the 
fifth and $28 on the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, he starts over with his initial $2 wager, then bets $6 on the 
eighth and $10 on the ninth. And the reason he doesn't need newspapers or 
magazines or tout sheets is because on most days he bets only favorites. 
</P>
<P>
However, if he sees that one of the local newspaper selectors is running hot, 
he will bet the top choice of that handicapper instead of the favorite. But no 
matter how he wagers, it is strictly an automatic reaction, since he relies on 
others and not himself. 
</P>
<P>
Although Read won only $2.80 on the first race on May 12, it was the start of 
an exceptionally good day, despite his losing $6 on the second race and $10 on 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
Losing $13.20 by the fourth, Read bet on Lucky Lucky You, which went off at 
odds of $1.40-$1. The nag, in a six-furlong sprint for 3-year-old maidens and 
up, took the lead at the quarter pole by a head. At the half-mile marker, Lucky 
Lucky You increased its front-running margin to 1 1/2 lengths, pulled ahead by 
2 1/2 lengths entering the stretch and finished three lengths in front. As the 
favorite, the nag paid a $4.80 mutuel, and Read collected $38.40 for his $16 
bet. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead $9.20, Read wagered $22 on the fifth race, which was a 1-1/16-mile route 
for 4-year-olds and up. The favorite, Hollywood Hays, won at the finish by half 
a length and paid $5, putting Read ahead $42.20. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth turned out to be a big win for Read. His horse, Proclamation, running 
a mile in a race for 3-year-old fillies, took a three-length lead at the 
three-quarter pole and easily finished in front, paying a big $8 as the 
favorite. Read's bet of $28 was worth $112. His profit of $84 put him in front 
$126.20. 
</P>
<P>
When Read lost $2 on the seventh and $6 on the eighth, he wasn't worried. He 
was still $118.20 ahead for the day. 
</P>
<P>
With only one race to go, he bet $10 on the heavy favorite, Taffta Shawl, which 
was running 1 1/8 on the grass. The nag took a head lead going into the stretch 
and finished 2 1/2 lengths in front. Although it paid a $3.80 mutuel, Read made 
$9, profiting $127.20 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Why Read picks the favorite to wager on is anyone's guess. Favorites only 
manage to win about 30% to 33% of the time. And newspaper handicappers, who win 
about 28% of their selections, are even worse. 
</P>
<P>
Read, however, is philosophical about his betting. 
</P>
<P>
He says that if you compare the totalizator board to a book, with the horses 
the inside pages, then there's a winner flashing on the totalizator board every 
race. You only have to read it!

TYCOON'S LUCK WITH BORROWING RUNS OUT; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCING: FOR YEARS, ALAN BOND KEPT CREDITORS AT BAY WHILE SETTING UP HIS NEXT 
DEAL. WITH DEBTS OF $6 BILLION, HE APPEARS OUT AS HEAD OF BOND HOLDINGS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Financier Alan Bond has been making money on borrowed money since completing 
his first land deal in 1960 at age 22. It appears that the bill finally has 
come due. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years after he took out a loan on five acres of land at Perth in the 
first step toward building a multinational empire, the businessman and 
yachtsman has offered to quit as chairman of his flagship Bond Holdings Ltd. to 
appease the company's anxious creditors, who are owed $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement under which Bond will relinquish control of his vast empire was 
reached Thursday. Although details must be worked out, the deal could clear the 
way for refinancing arrangements that could ultimately save many of Bond's 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a long fall for Bond, known for brash and flamboyant dealings in 
business and elsewhere. He financed the Australian sailing team's stunning 
triumph over the United States in the 1983 America's Cup race. 
</P>
<P>
Only three years ago, he bought Vincent Van Gogh's "Irises" from Sotheby's for 
what was a then-record $53.9 million, a sale that the auction house helped 
finance. In March, he sold the painting for an undisclosed amount. Reports were 
that he took a loss on it. 
</P>
<P>
Bond has never lacked confidence. After immigrating from Britain with his 
father to Perth, in the state of Western Australia, he quit school at 14 to 
take a job with a sign-painting company. Because he had done poorly on a 
spelling test, he had to talk hard to get the owner to take him. 
</P>
<P>
When things didn't work out, he and his father started a competitor, Nu-Signs, 
that generated the cash he needed for some of his later deals. 
</P>
<P>
According to a biography released last week by journalist Paul Barry, "The Rise 
and Fall of Alan Bond," the financier developed a strategy of keeping creditors 
at bay while buying and selling land in rapidly developing Perth. 
</P>
<P>
He reportedly was close to bankruptcy in 1962 after stringing along Nu-Signs' 
creditors too long but managed to work out an arrangement at the last minute. 
The next day, he made a large purchase at a land auction. 
</P>
<P>
Barry wrote that with rising land prices, Bond often would agree to buy a plot, 
promising a small deposit, then have it immediately revalued at a higher price. 
That way he could borrow more money than had to be paid to the vendor. 
</P>
<P>
With a flair for picking and promoting development sites, he made his first 
million at 29 -- in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
He took advantage of eager bankers peddling expensive credit, particularly 
after Australia's financial deregulation in 1983, and a stock market full of 
hungry investors. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak, Bond Holdings included interests in brewing, communications, 
natural resources and property. He rode out the 1987 stock market crash on the 
cash-generating strength of his beer businesses. 
</P>
<P>
That actually may have led to his downfall, however, as Bond Holdings picked up 
steam and eventually ran up debts estimated at $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Rising interest rates and bad business decisions alienated Bond's bankers and 
creditors, put his Australian brewing interests into receivership and forced 
him to sell assets ranging from a Hong Kong office development to a coal mine. 
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that the final straw may have come when Bond tangled with 
London-based financier R. W. (Tiny) Rowland. He bought 20.4% of Rowland's 
Lonrho PLC in 1988 in a move that appeared to presage a takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
He was forced to sell a year later, saying that he "underestimated the venom" 
of Rowland, who waged a campaign focusing on Bond's debt. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland is quoted in Barry's book as saying that he decided to destroy Bond 
after the Australian tried to take his yacht's parking place on the French 
Riviera.

NOT GOING TO LET A FEW LOSSES RUIN HIS JOB.

<P>
Sitting in the middle of the restaurant Friday afternoon, having lunch hours 
before his team would lose yet another game, Greg Riddoch's eyes were 
transfixed. 
</P>
<P>
Across the room was an aquarium containing live lobsters, and Riddoch kept 
looking at it until the parallel finally hit him. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, he said, "that's kind of like me. There's a lobster sitting in cool 
water, just relaxing and letting the water go through its gills. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, all of a sudden, someone snatches it and throws it in a pot of scalding 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"It deadens your senses right away." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, in the midst of all of this, Gregory Lee Riddoch still is able to 
laugh. Well, outwardly, at least. His insides are bubbling to a point at which 
he already has lost five pounds, and he has been on the job only since July 11. 
Welcome to the Padre manager's chair, where your dream, too, can turn into a 
living hell. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have won just one game since Riddoch was promoted as manager, losing 
games in ways that have even Little League kids wincing. It has gotten so bad 
that instead of Riddoch consoling players, they're consoling him. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so bad for Greg," Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst said. "No one deserves 
this. We're just playing awful, and it's not his fault at all." 
</P>
<P>
Said first baseman Jack Clark: "It takes a lot of guts for him to take this 
over. I think he's doing a super job. He's pushing the right buttons, but we're 
the ones letting him down." 
</P>
<P>
This, more than anything, reveals the respect and intimacy Riddoch has with his 
players. The players are well aware Riddoch was hired as a manager only through 
the end of the season and that managers with a .090 winning percentage don't 
tend to stick around for long. But please, they say, give the man a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe we have the right man for the job," right fielder Tony Gwynn 
said. "It's so tough for him to right the ship when it's sinking, but I really 
believe if anyone can, it's Greg. I know he's not going to give up, he'll fight 
to the end." 
</P>
<P>
You would think that a man who has just 10 weeks left to prove to his owners 
that he's right for the job would be panicking. He should be acting as if he's 
waiting a last-minute stay-of-execution call from the governor, but instead, 
it's as if he's waiting for the President to call and chit-chat. He's been 
calm, almost serene, during this rash of defeats. 
</P>
<P>
You want him to criticize one of his players, ripping him to shreds in the 
fashion that would give Dick Williams goose bumps. Uh-uh. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to ever hear me criticize one of my players through the 
paper," Riddoch said, "Never. That's not my style. When something needs to be 
said, it'll be done between me and the player, and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch made it clear that if the players wanted to continue to make stupid 
mistakes on the field, go ahead, but they'll have to keep opening their wallets 
every time, too. He installed a Kangaroo Court, complete with three judges, 
with all fines going to the San Diego Children's' Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He has had separate meetings with Clark and Gwynn, trying to repress the 
clubhouse feuds and cliques. He also is meeting individually with each player 
on the team, listening to their complaints, annoyances and suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
It's still unknown, of course, just how long Riddoch will be able to continue 
his first-aid effort. He has a managerial contract through the end of the 
season. If Padre chairman Tom Werner likes what he sees, he'll exercise the 
option that will pay Riddoch about $180,000 next season. If Werner wants 
someone else, Riddoch has been guaranteed that he will continue as a coach, for 
about $100,000 less. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seems to be going wrong right now," Werner said, "but I'm not going 
to judge Greg on some of the problems he inherited. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very clearly a guy who is aware of the problems on the team, and has some 
solutions to solve them. I feel this is a step in the right direction. He's a 
good motivator and teacher, and I think he's in the mold of a Tom Trebelhorn 
(of Milwaukee) and Tony LaRussa (of Oakland). 
</P>
<P>
"I believed in Greg when we chose him. And I still believe in him." 
</P>
<P>
Funny, that's what everybody's saying about the guy. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a wonderful way of making life enjoyable for people surrounding him," 
said Tom Runnells, third base coach of the Montreal Expos, who played for 
Riddoch in high school. "I've never seen anything like it. He has a way of 
getting people to enjoy coming to the park and wanting to work, but he has the 
ability to get everything out of youngsters and veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind that he'll turn around that team. Once they get 
going, there's no looking back." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch, who has spent his life working in almost every facet of baseball, 
seems to make an indelible impression on everyone he encounters. Why else would 
a man receive 55 congratulatory messages on his hotel phone the night he 
received the job, and about 40 more calls and telegrams the next day? 
</P>
<P>
There was one man in particular who was so exuberant at the news that he 
thought he was going to cry. His name? 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis, All-Star outfielder of the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
They first met in 1981. Davis had just graduated from Fremont High School, an 
inner-city school in Los Angeles, and was leaving home for the first time in 
his life. He went to Eugene, Ore., where he was assigned as an eighth-round 
draft choice of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Well, after batting .219 with one homer and 11 RBIs in 33 games, Davis wanted 
out. He had basketball scholarships awaiting at Arizona State and Pepperdine. 
Who needed this aggravation? 
</P>
<P>
"I was really unhappy," he said. "But every day he kept talking to me. He kept 
telling me not to give up. I think everybody was down on me, but Greg, he not 
only battled for me, he went to war for me. 
</P>
<P>
"He's made such an impression on me that he'll always be special in my life. 
He's like a part of family now. I'd do anything for that man. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me put it like this: If it wasn't for Greg Riddoch, I wouldn't be here 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
Almost 10 years to the day after Riddoch first managed him in short-season 
Class-A ball, Davis will face Riddoch the manager for first time today in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
And who knows just what would have happened if Davis had known Riddoch would 
manage the Padres? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, don't ask me that one, that's a tough one," Davis said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the secret to understanding Riddoch's charm with people who come in 
contact with him is looking at this background. 
</P>
<P>
He never knew his real father and wasn't close to his stepfather. He was reared 
in California and attended Garden Grove High School. 
</P>
<P>
For those of the '63 graduating class who are trying to remember him, take out 
your yearbook and look under the name of Greg Bezlij. That was the last name of 
his stepfather. It wasn't until several years later that he reverted to his 
natural father's name. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, Riddoch isn't the most publicized graduate of the class. A fellow 
by the name of Steve Martin, the comedian/actor, also happened to be part of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch went off to the University of Northern Colorado on a baseball and 
basketball scholarship and four years later was drafted and signed by 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a home-run hitter in college, but when we saw him, I don't remember him 
hitting a single one," said Dick Poole, who's now the Chicago Cubs' pitching 
coach. "He wasn't what we called a tough out." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch spent six years in the minors chasing his dream, which by his account 
was two years too long. He finally quit and became a teacher at Greeley (Colo.) 
High, where he helped run everything from the band to school plays to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Howsam, the Reds' farm director, telephoned Riddoch one month later and 
asked him if he would manage one of their minor league teams during his summer 
months. Why not? Riddoch spent each summer managing in the Northwest League. 
When he was promoted to assistant principal and didn't have enough time to 
manage, he became a regional scouting supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Then one day, after watching an American Legion game in Butte, Mont., he 
returned to his hotel room and received a message from Howsam, who had retired 
in 1978 from the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Said Howsam: "They're going to let (General Manager) Dick Wagner go tomorrow. I 
want to refine the Big Red Machine, and I want you to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch wasn't sure what to do. He hated to uproot his family. But the more he 
listened, the more excited he became. Howsam was going to groom him to be the 
next general manager and was so sincere that he was offering him a three-year 
guaranteed contract totaling $180,000. When you're making $28,000 as an 
assistant principal, the decision becomes quite simple. 
</P>
<P>
Everything went fine for two years. Riddoch vaulted through the system, from 
assistant director of player development and scouting to the minor league 
director and had been told that in four months, he would be assistant general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Well, that changed on July 7, 1985. Howsam met with new owner Marge Schott for 
more than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Howsam announced his retirement. Schott became the new president 
and chief operating officer, Riddoch a lame duck. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch still had a year left on his contract, but he made it easy on her. He 
resigned effective Dec. 31, 1985. He was going to work in the Seattle Mariners 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Well, just a few weeks before he was getting ready for the move, he was told 
the job wasn't available after all. 
</P>
<P>
Much to Riddoch's surprise, offers started coming in from all directions. It 
was Tom Romenesko, Padre director of player development, who finally wooed him. 
He started work on Jan. 1, 1986, as associate director of minor leagues and 
scouting. In seven weeks, he came director of the department. In eight months, 
he became a coach on Larry Bowa's staff. And now, after 3 1/2 years as coach, 
he's the 13th manager of the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"Kind of makes you dizzy, doesn't it?" Riddoch said. "My feet still aren't on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Who'd have thought a guy like me would be doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon, who was manager and vice president/baseball operations, said to 
Riddoch: "You know, one day, I think you're going to be manager." 
</P>
<P>
Said Riddoch: "Thanks, but, uh, if you don't mind, let's don't even talk about 
that stuff. I just want to concentrate on coaching." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon agreed not to bring it up again, and Riddoch walked away thinking that 
in three or four years, maybe he would be manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, here I am," Riddoch said, "feeling absolutely naked. But I think 
everything will work out, I really do." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be. Maybe the Good Lord is saying, 
'Greg, I never said this would be easy, but I believe you're the right man.

Argentine writer Manuel Puig, who gained international fame for his novel, 
"Kiss of the Spider Woman," died of a heart attack Sunday. He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
Puig, who was suffering complications from gall bladder surgery, had earned a 
reputation as a leading member of the younger generation of Latin American 
writers for his novels written in a cinematic, non-narrative style. 
</P>
<P>
His works often explored the relationships between his characters' impoverished 
lives and their rich, if unfulfilled, fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
Puig wrote several books, and some were made into successful movies. Among his 
novels are "The Kiss of the Spider Woman," "Betrayed by Rita Hayworth," 
"Eternal Curse on the Reader of These Pages" and "Heartbreak Tango." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 Brazilian filmmaker Hector Babenco released a film version of "Kiss of 
the Spider Woman." The story is set in a bleak Argentine prison cell shared by 
a Marxist guerrilla, portrayed in the film by Raul Julia, and a homosexual, 
portrayed by William Hurt, who won an Academy Award. Their dialogue is 
interspersed with the homosexual's recounting of plots of romantic movies. 
</P>
<P>
Puig also wrote numerous plays and movie scripts. 
</P>
<P>
He was born on Dec. 28, 1932, in the small town of General Villegas, on the 
arid pampas of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the University of Buenos Aires, Puig sought to launch a career in 
the film industry and began to write screenplays. 
</P>
<P>
With the return of Juan Peron to power in Argentina in 1973, Puig felt 
increasingly alienated from his country. He went into self-imposed exile, 
eventually settling in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Puig's play, "Mystery of the Rose Bouquet," was recently produced in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his mother, Maria Elena de Puig, brother Carlos Puig, sons 
Javier, Labrada and Agustin Garcia Gil, all living in Cuernavaca, where his 
funeral was held Sunday night. He will be buried in a family plot in La Plata, 
Argentina, Labrada said.

Gov. James J. Florio is the grandson of Italian immigrants and the son of a 
Brooklyn Navy Yard ship painter. Thus, he says, he shares the struggles of 
working people. 
</P>
<P>
One of his most traumatic memories as a child, he says, was watching a union 
"shape-up" with his father. He recalls it as "a very, very degrading process. A 
hundred people showed up in the hall, and they would pick five people out of 
the 100. It was almost like a slave market." 
</P>
<P>
Florio dropped out of high school, he says, because "I was bored. Thought I 
didn't need it." But when he considered becoming a New York City policeman 
after a three-year stint in the Navy, Florio discovered that his lack of 
education closed that and many other opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
So Florio took correspondence courses that enabled him to pass the General 
Education Development, or high-school equivalency test. College took him to New 
Jersey, where he attended Trenton State College on the GI Bill, and he went to 
law school in Camden. 
</P>
<P>
In Camden, he also got his introduction to politics. Elected to the New Jersey 
Assembly in 1969, he ran for Congress and lost in 1972. He tried again and won 
the first of his seven elections to Congress two years later. He won the 
governorship in 1989. Karen Tumulty
