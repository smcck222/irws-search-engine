RESPONSE TO 2 MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is something insidiously abnormal in the comparisons of two "death 
articles" recounted on the front page of the Metro Section (July 14). Within 
the span of 48 hours, two separate guns barked and two separate people died. It 
goes without saying that the heinous and wanton murder of Andre Coffyn quickly 
joined the annals of burgeoning monstrosities. Likewise, gunning down Walter 
Dale Stewart Jr. the day before his 18th birthday was even more than the 
helplessness from his mother's utterance of "sad." 
</P>
<P>
But there the similarity between Coffyn and Stewart ends. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that one dead man was black, and the other was white; or that one was 
from Europe and the other from America. It is not that one had already built 
his material success while the other had just that day been accepted into a 
computer job placement program. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it is that now -- like it or not -- we almost automatically and in a 
take-it-for-granted manner, grade the value of a life. One's death is the type, 
in the words of Los Angeles Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, that "sends a shiver 
down the collective spine." The other merely forces a grieving father to stare 
blankly beyond the back-yard fence. One is of the death of a suave Frenchman; 
the other is simply "1 of 4 victims to die in the violence on Los Angeles 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
One is shot by a robber in his Westside restaurant while sitting with a group 
of diners; the other is shot for no particular reason, alone. One man's death 
sparks patrols and demands an instant reward for the killer; the other is 
relegated to the statistics of gang war and drive-by incidents. One deals with 
Yaroslavsky's issue of "the confidence a community feels." The other, sadly 
enough, deals with the confidence a community should feel.

COMMUTER TRAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All of our elected officials are incredibly blind to the solution to our 
traffic problems. They do not see that the only solution to both traffic and 
pollution is to drastically reduce the number of cars in Southern California. 
The answer does not lie in computerized signals or massive freeway additions. 
We need commuter trains running down the centers of our freeways. Our lives are 
already arranged around freeway routes and accesses and overpasses already 
exist that could provide access to trains. 
</P>
<P>
How many who commute to downtown Los Angeles would not be thrilled to ride a 
speedy train to their jobs? I would gladly avoid the San Diego Freeway and ride 
a train from Torrance to the San Fernando Valley to visit family. 
</P>
<P>
Trains seem like such an obvious solution to me and my family that I cannot 
imagine why our elected officials do not give them serious consideration. Could 
it be that they are being blinded and perhaps bought by oil companies, 
insurance companies and auto makers? 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a transit system that enabled each family to require only one car. 
Imagine our insurance and gasoline savings not to mention saving the cost of a 
car. Now, imagine the huge auto, oil and insurance industries supporting such a 
system. Well, never mind, I guess it's really quite beyond the scope of human 
imagination.

LANDMARK BILL FOR CHILD CARE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress is so close to passing landmark child-care legislation that it must 
keep inching forward despite threats of a presidential veto or efforts by some 
House members to adopt a minimal program. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate and a key House committee have passed bills that differ in some 
specific ways but are so alike in basic approach that they can and should be 
merged into significant legislation. It is time for Congress to act to help 
fill the growing need for better child care. 
</P>
<P>
In late June, the Senate passed the Act for Better Child Care Services, known 
as the ABC bill, that provides $1.75 billion for a combination of tax credits 
to parents and grants to states to increase child-care programs and to help 
parents pay for care. In so doing, the Senate rejected a presidentially backed 
substitute that would have relied solely on tax credits. The bill also requires 
states to set safety standards for child-care programs. 
</P>
<P>
Days later, the House Education and Labor Committee approved HR 3, the Child 
Development and Education Act of 1989. The bill provides $1.78 billion for a 
variety of children's programs, including subsidies for child care. It differs 
from the Senate bill in that it calls for a major expansion of the Head Start 
preschool program and provides financial incentives for school systems to 
develop more child-care programs. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action this past week, the House Ways and Means Committee 
approved tax credits for child care. That's good, but that committee's bill 
contains only $400 million a year to expand the supply of day care and improve 
its quality. That's far less than what the Senate passed or what is contained 
in HR 3. Thus, the Ways and Means Committee bill alone will not be sufficient 
to provide real improvement in child care. Groups like the Children's Defense 
Fund hope to win commitments soon from House members to combine the tax-credit 
bill and HR 3. That way the House would go to a conference committee with the 
Senate with the strongest possible package. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the principal players are in familiar roles of leadership. Rep. 
Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Education and Labor 
Committee, is one, and Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), a longtime advocate of 
improved child care, is another. But one key figure is a surprise. He is Sen. 
Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who has been severely criticized for his role and 
deserves special commendation. Hatch, a conservative, told an interviewer: "I 
think I'm doing what's right. I started looking at the statistics and the 
facts, and when you do, you ask, 'What are we doing to our families?' You've 
got to be concerned about the parents who just don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, President Bush does not yet share Hatch's insight. Bush says he 
will veto any ABC-type bill. He prefers to let parents decide with their 
dollars what kind of care they want. But the small tax credit he has in mind 
would leave parents with minimal care and do nothing to help create badly 
needed new programs. Parents want and deserve a better choice than the one the 
President offers. Congress should give it to them by passing a combination of 
the solid measures now before it.

FAMILY PLANNING FUNDS VETOED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. Deukmejian's family planning budget cuts will only cause more abortions in 
California. His actions are totally counterproductive to reducing abortions. He 
is saying that since Medi-Cal paid for 77,000 abortions last year, it is 
obvious that the money allocated for family planning is not working. He is, 
therefore, cutting their funding from $36 million to $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to believe that such a well-educated, elected official of our state 
could reach such an irrational conclusion. Saying that the 77,000 abortions are 
due to lack of family planning clinic effectiveness is ridiculous. The real 
problem is educating our sexually active young adults to use contraception and 
to increase its availability. This is how to reduce unwanted pregnancy and 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has consistently fought against effective sex education, which must 
include a discussion of contraception, in our public schools. He has now cut 
the family planning budget in our state by two-thirds which will make it much 
more difficult for our young adults to get contraception if they decide to be 
sexually active. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to understand the governor's logic on this issue. He is completely 
wrong if he thinks that by not discussing contraception in schools and by 
decreasing the family planning budget, he will increase teen-age abstinence. 
The facts, which Deukmejian is well aware, are that 8 of 10 boys and 7 of 10 
girls are sexually active by the time they are seniors in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian must change his position, or he will be responsible for many more 
abortions in our state.

A BOMBER FOR THE 21ST CENTURY, TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
B-2 WILL UPDATE OUR STRATEGIC TRIAD -- AND THAT'S THE BARGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN T. CHAIN JR., Gen. John T. Chain Jr. is commander in chief of the 
Strategic Air Command. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The B-2 stealth bomber has now made its first flight -- a major step in the 
complicated process of weapons-system acquisition. Because of the long time 
from conception to reality of a new system, especially true when nuclear 
capability is involved, many opinions are offered as to the potential value of 
the system. This is now the case with the B-2. For that reason, I want to 
review the facts of why the B-2 is necessary for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years, the nation has depended on a triad of strategic forces 
-- a mix of manned bombers and land- and sea-based missiles. This robust 
posture confounds any potential attacker and provides the United States with a 
wide range of options and capability. Each part of the triad offers distinct 
and complementary advantages. (See accompanying chart.) 
</P>
<P>
Of the three elements of the triad, the bomber provides the most potent and 
unique combination of range, heavy payload, accuracy and mix of weapons. Most 
important, the crew in the cockpit makes the bomber a wide-ranging, recallable 
and reusable system of enormous flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, the B-2? Under secret development for over 10 years, the stealth 
bomber continues a program of strategic modernization that has been 
"blueprinted" across both Republican and Democratic Administrations. Each leg 
of the triad, in order to be more effective or reliable, has been improved. For 
the bomber force, the B-2 is a sophisticated approach made possible by a 
technologically advanced America. The B-2 provides all the desirable qualities 
of a manned and penetrating bomber well into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2 is compatible with strategic arms limitation initiatives that seem 
achievable in the 1990s. Both sides recognize that fast-flying ballistic 
missiles are the most destabilizing weapons and, therefore, both sides seek 
maximum restrictions on their numbers. On the other hand, each side understands 
the stabilizing, non-first-strike nature of the penetrating bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Yet our current bomber force is, on average, a quarter of a century old and 
being retired rapidly. Of the 372 aircraft remaining, 48 FB-111s are slated for 
transfer to the tactical air forces and 61 B-52s are dedicated to a 
conventional role. (Fourteen of these aircraft will phase out of service this 
year.) Most disturbing is the fact that a large number of B-52s, most with 
air-launched cruise missile capability, are expected to go to the boneyard over 
the next several years. The few B-52s remaining will move from a penetrating 
role to a standoff mission (or a conventional role), leaving only the B-1 to 
penetrate in the mid-to late-'90s. With the addition of at least 132 B-2s, the 
synergism of the triad will be maintained and the highly developed and 
expensive Soviet air defense network will be much less effective. 
</P>
<P>
For a deterrent force of this value, the B-2 investment will necessarily be 
substantial. However, "sticker shock" assertions require analysis. There are 
useful methods to fairly portray the B-2's affordability. For example, with 
respect to cost per potential warhead delivered, the B-2 force is about equal 
to the B-1 force and actually less than some modernized ballistic-missile 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
In relation to the just acquired B-1, the B-2 cost is about 25% greater: That's 
money well spent to buy an enduring and unique nuclear and conventional 
capability. 
</P>
<P>
On balance, we should spend for defense only what we must to ensure our 
security. If we prudently invest and create strategic leverage in our favor, 
that's good. The nuclear and conventional combat capability of our strategic 
bomber force provides us with such leverage. Long-range bomber striking power 
-- the ability to reach anywhere in the world in a few hours -- is integral to 
future security. With its low observable characteristics and modern bomber 
capabilities of intercontinental range, the B-2 can respond with a full 
spectrum of retaliatory capability. It can deal with terrorist acts or global 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
I need a warplane whose performance, reliability and maintainability will meet 
the demanding needs validated over a decade of development and experience. 
Continued prudence will be essential to manage the pace of manufacturing, 
testing and deployment of this bomber. The B-2 is too important to be driven by 
artificial timeliness or unrealistic goals. It will be in the employ of the 
nation for many years. 
</P>
<P>
With the rollout of the B-2 last November, and now its first flight, a major 
milestone in aviation history has taken place. In retrospect, the first flight 
of the B-2 will be viewed as a revolutionary moment as important as the 
transition from propeller-driven to jet aircraft. We will learn much along the 
way as we work with this exciting new bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Let us now reap the benefits of long years of effort, expense and bipartisan 
support. The B-2 is here and it makes eminently good sense for our nation.

STATEHOOD FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WOULD END ITS UNFAIR COLONIAL STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is planning to move to 
Washington, D.C., was a 1988 candidate for the Democratic presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The time has come to place statehood for the people of Washington, D.C., at the 
very forefront of the nation's civil-rights agenda. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, more than 200 years after the U.S. Constitution promised to "secure 
the blessings of liberty" to all citizens, the District of Columbia's colonial 
status is a scandal that must be brought to the attention of the nation and the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
It is a little-known but increasingly intolerable reality that 650,000 
Americans living in the district have only a limited form of home rule that is 
subject to congressional veto at all times. Even worse, they are denied the 
right to voting representation in Congress, the very institution that has final 
say over their land, their property, their laws and, ultimately, their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Washington, D.C., are living under congressional occupation. 
</P>
<P>
But now we have the chance to wipe out this stain on American democracy by 
passing bipartisan legislation, pending now in Congress, to carve out a 
separate "federal enclave" of government buildings and designate the rest of 
the District as "New Columbia," the 51st state of the Union. 
</P>
<P>
The American revolutionaries who dumped tea in Boston Harbor held up this 
slogan: "No taxation without representation!" And today that slogan should be 
raised again by more than half a million patriotic Americans who pay federal 
taxes, fight and die in foreign wars and are subject to federal laws written by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens of the District of Columbia have fought in every war since the 
American Revolution. In the Vietnam War, the people of the district suffered 
more casualties than the people of 10 states and more casualties on a 
per-capita basis than the people of 47 states. 
</P>
<P>
The people of the district annually contribute more than a billion dollars in 
taxes to the federal treasury, which is more in absolute terms than nine states 
pay and more in per-capita terms than is paid by 49 states. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when democracy is afire in the minds of people all over the world, 
this shocking colonialism in the nation's capital threatens America's claim to 
be the world's leader in democracy . 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the United States is the only democracy on Earth that denies 
parliamentary representation to the citizens of its capital city. Indeed, of 
115 nations with elected national legislatures, from Austria through Zimbabwe, 
only the United States denies representation to citizens of its capital city. 
</P>
<P>
How would we react if the citizens of Paris were denied representation in the 
French National Assembly, 200 years after the French Revolution, or if the 
citizens of Bonn were given no voice in the Bundestag? 
</P>
<P>
It would be cause for outrage because it offends common sense, which is the 
very basis of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
That is why a national survey conducted by former President Reagan's pollster, 
Richard Wirthlin, determined that by an overwhelming 8-to-1 margin, Americans 
agree that the citizens of the district are entitled to the same rights as the 
citizens of the 50 states. The poll also found that, by a 2-to-1 margin, 
Americans support bipartisan legislation now before Congress to make "New 
Columbia" the 51st state. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the 1988 Democratic Party platform promoted statehood for 
Washington, D.C., as a plank, and that is why it should be in the Republican 
President's program in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments against statehood make no sense. For example, it is said that the 
population of Washington, D.C., is too small for statehood. But the fact is 
that more American citizens live there than in Vermont, Wyoming, North Dakota 
or Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a magic population threshold for statehood, the people of 
Washington have already passed it. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it will be said that the state created by the people of Washington will 
wield too much power over the federal government. But the supremacy clause of 
the Constitution makes it clear that federal law and policy prevail over the 
law of any state. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the opposition to statehood for Washington is based on partisan 
political motivation or -- we must be frank -- racism. The next time someone 
tells you that the people of Washington don't "deserve" statehood, ask him if 
he would feel the same way if the city were two-thirds white. 
</P>
<P>
Such selfish and antiquated motivations should have no place in a matter of 
basic citizenship rights under the American form of government. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has said that he is in favor of statehood for Puerto Rico, when 
the people of Puerto Rico have not even applied for it. The people of 
Washington, D.C., on the other hand, adopted a "Constitution for the State of 
New Columbia" on Nov. 2, 1982. This Constitution and a petition for statehood 
were sent to Congress on Sept. 9, 1983. Yet President Bush, who lives in the 
district, has not yet declared his support for statehood for the people who 
live there. 
</P>
<P>
Surely President Bush and those members of Congress who were indignant about 
the Supreme Court's flag-burning decision love American democracy enough to 
extend its rights and privileges to all American citizens. Or is the rhetoric 
of democracy inside the Capitol not to be made the reality of life in the 
capital city? 
</P>
<P>
More than 650,000 good and patriotic American citizens are waiting for an 
answer.

IN TURNBULL CANYON, A WHOLE WORLD IS GONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL JUSTINE HUEBNER, Carol Justine Huebner lives in Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We live on Skyline Drive at the top of Turnbull Canyon, the area in the Puente 
Hills devastated by fire on July 3. Before the fire, our house was one of three 
on the canyon side of the road; now we're the only one left. 
</P>
<P>
I've lost my neighbors. Not so much the people; most of them, fortunately, are 
still here, and the others may return and rebuild. But I feel deserted by an 
equally important neighbor, the canyon itself. It's gone. The dry yellow 
grasses, the sycamore trees, the wildflowers have vanished. The avocado trees 
are shrivelled and pathetic. The canyon is black. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a pleasant sight, not the comforting view I have grown used to over 
the years. Where there was the overgrown horse trail that wound through 
thickets of oak trees and ivy, there is now a jagged scar, barren and 
forbidding. Instead of a grassy observation knoll at the first turn, an abrupt 
shelf juts out over exposed crevices. Gone is the protected meadow of flattened 
brush where deer could eat in safety. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 11 years, my eyes have rested on this canyon a hundred times a 
day, but on our first day back in the house after the fire, there was no 
comfort through the ashen windows. We looked out on a landscape that was 
totally alien. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, the blackened hills are softening their contours, as if in 
apology. And we've been assured that, even if the county doesn't reseed the 
area, native brush will spring back healthier than before. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a dear friend has been lost. As so often happens during a disaster, 
people here rediscovered friends and neighbors and demonstrated spontaneous 
acts of kindness. And, of course, we feel tremendous gratitude to the 
firefighters who saved our house and who were still nearby for us to thank when 
we returned. 
</P>
<P>
But, at least for awhile, I'm not at ease in these unfamiliar surroundings. 
Deck plants are dark skeletons, and every afternoon the wind howls, carrying 
gray ash to recoat indoor and outside surfaces and claim our home as the fire 
failed to do.

TO KEEP U.S. IN THE CHIPS, MODIFY THE ANTITRUST LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS M. JORDE and DAVID J. TEECE, Thomas M. Jorde is a professor of law 
and David J. Teece is a professor of business at UC Berkeley. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Formation of U.S. Memories Inc., the consortium of U.S. computer and 
semiconductor firms to make state-of-the-art DRAM chips, indicates that U.S. 
firms are finally beginning to use cooperation as a tool for competition. 
Unfortunately, the consortium is born under the shadow of outdated U.S. 
antitrust law that will restrict the company's ability to compete with foreign 
producers. The new company must endeavor to obtain full value from technology 
it acquires or generates, while avoiding antitrust policies adopted in a 
different era for different problems. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Memories, which apparently will receive equity contributions from seven 
firms (Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Advanced Micro Devices, Digital Equipment Corp., 
Intel, LSI Logic and National Semiconductor), will establish facilities to 
manufacture DRAMs, some fraction of which the investors will be obligated to 
purchase. Its initial technology will be licensed from IBM. 
</P>
<P>
This is a novel arrangement for U.S. industry, and it indicates a recognition 
of common interests between semiconductor users and producers, and also among 
the users. The competitive disadvantage that many U.S. computer manufacturers 
face vis-a-vis their Japanese competition may be softened by this venture. 
</P>
<P>
But the new firm is already affected and impeded by U.S. antitrust laws. More 
bad news may be in store if the new company is successful. We see several ways 
that this venture is affected by antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While the need for such an enterprise has been clear for years, it has been 
slow in coming in part because managers and lawyers had to wind their way 
through a thicket of antitrust concerns and constraints. Even preliminary 
discussions among competitors create antitrust concerns, because it may be 
illegal for competitors to discuss future investment plans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The new venture is exposed to possible lawsuits from other U.S. chip 
producers. If it wants to migrate into related products like static RAMS, it 
could face treble-damage lawsuits from specialist firms. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Investors will not have access to the venture's proprietary memory 
technology. We see no sound economic reason for this stance; it may stem from 
antitrust concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- U.S. Memories' decision to build new facilities, rather than use the 
capacity of several of the co-venturers, may also be driven by antitrust 
uncertainty regarding cooperative contractual arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a key reason why firms want to be part of U.S. Memories is because 
DRAMs are "technology drivers." Producing them generates new skills and 
capabilities relevant in other areas. To imprison this technology for antitrust 
reasons is to handicap the company's position to contribute to U.S. 
competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Before the patience of U.S. Memories' partners wears thin, and before they 
compromise the enterprise in order to steer around antitrust concerns, Congress 
should modify antitrust laws to ensure that arrangements like this are legal. 
Antitrust reform is no panacea for the problems facing U.S. industry, but it 
could lower a major barrier for high-technology firms, particularly small and 
medium-sized ones. 
</P>
<P>
Bills recently introduced in Congress would reduce treble-damage antitrust 
exposure now faced by firms that enter into cooperative agreements and 
consortiums created to develop and commercialize new technologies. Both the 
"registration" approach of one bill and the "certification" approach of another 
are desirable. 
</P>
<P>
A registration procedure operates with modest government involvement, but 
provides modest relief as well. It would reduce antitrust exposure to single 
damages instead of treble damages. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed certification procedure would involve review by the Department of 
Justice or Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with the Department of 
Commerce, to ensure that the cooperative arrangement does not create 
substantial market power. A cooperative innovation arrangement among firms 
whose combined market shares are less than 20% would be automatically approved. 
When combined shares are greater than 20%, the arrangement would be approved 
only if it improved competitive performance, and the combination was warranted 
on the basis of scale, complementary capabilities and a demonstrable need for 
operational and strategic coordination. If a certificate of exemption is 
obtained, the threat of antitrust damages is eliminated and private antitrust 
challenges would be limited to injunctive relief. 
</P>
<P>
Certification is a necessary companion to registration because it provides a 
mechanism for evaluating and approving cooperative arrangements and consortiums 
involving firms with large market shares. Registration alone will not provide 
the certainty needed to encourage large-scale consortiums. If Congress adopts 
only a registration approach, it can expect to see a continuation of the 
present case-by-case, industry-specific petitioning for antitrust exemptions, 
which is expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
These antitrust law changes are not going to remedy America's relative decline 
in key technologies. But at least they will bring the United States closer to 
the policies of Europe and Japan, and in time, will encourage successful 
cooperative commercialization of innovation.

KALEIDOSCOPE REVIVED AT CAL STATE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the isolated, nomadic dancers and choreographers of Southern California, 
Dance Kaleidoscope has become an annual gathering of the clans -- a chance to 
display individual achievement in the context of a community showcase. 
</P>
<P>
For eight years, starting in 1979, the performance series survived its unwieldy 
grab-bag format and wildly fluctuating standards of quality control only to 
vanish with the collapse of its sponsor: the Los Angeles Area Dance Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Cal State L.A., a blue-ribbon selection panel and the city's Department 
of Performing Arts, all working to reconstitute Dance Kaleidoscope as a 
three-program (six-performance) event spread across two weekends. As before, 
the focus is on presenting up-and-coming artists: 24 soloists and groups who 
need a stage. The event no longer takes place at the John Anson Ford Theatre -- 
but that venue was never exactly ideal for dance and, anyway, who needs more 
summer traffic in Cahuenga Pass? 
</P>
<P>
The important thing is that the new, on-campus location, the city money, the 
uniform audition process and the shared commitment to excellence have made no 
difference whatsoever. Dance Kaleidoscope re-emerged over the weekend exactly 
as it used to be: flagrantly, gloriously uneven, boasting some dancers that 
only a mother could love and choreography that amounted to budget knockoffs of 
the era's most celebrated innovations. 
</P>
<P>
On Program A, Saturday night, Naomi Goldberg's new, ad hoc Los Angeles Modern 
Dance and Ballet Company perfectly caught the gestalt of the event with the 
playful Baroque suite "Looking in a Fishtank," in which people of nearly every 
possible age, race, sex, physical condition and level of expertise executed the 
same movement tasks in a procession resembling the epic winning-of-the-West 
sequences from "Billy the Kid." Welcome to the new frontier: dancing as 
variegated as the Los Angeles audience. 
</P>
<P>
This endearing throwback to the anyone-can-dance phase of early minimalism 
found its complement in the sensational contact-style duet that opened the 
lumpy genre piece "Dawg Tired and Dirty," with Karen Johnson boldly lifting and 
swinging Steven Craig as if declaring her emancipation from societal partnering 
stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Liberation of another sort informed Stephanie Gilliland's solo "Sticks and 
Fall," in which involvement in music and formal movement process seemed to 
bring the dancer close to a personal breakthrough -- a mode of direct, 
instinctual expression beyond performing. It didn't happen Saturday, but the 
attempt provided the only genuine risk and experiment on the program. 
</P>
<P>
Recently reviewed, Ferne Ackerman's finely crafted group piece "Flame" looked 
hectic and oversold at this performance, just as Andor Czomp's fluent 
Herdsman's Dance ("Ecsegi Kanasztanc") for Karpatok Hungarian Folk Ensemble 
proved curiously flat. Even more disappointing: the insensitive and often 
unmotivated dancing by California Theatre Ballet of "Sunflowers," the late 
Antony Tudor's masterful 1971 study of shifting emotional alliances. 
</P>
<P>
Though Young-Ae Park's "Da'Mong" (Dream Layers) began in tantalizing 
processional vignettes, it soon dumped dance altogether to emphasize 
play-acting cliches. Still, the solo at least had Park's technical skill and 
concentration to recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
During intermission, the Katja Biesanz Dance Theatre presented the modest, 
whimsical "Chagall's Circus" on a small platform stage outdoors. Problematic 
visibility alone made this a dubious innovation in Kaleidoscope tradition, 
though the piece's artful costumes and body masks (especially the gleaming 
fish) certainly looked alluring close-up in the moonlight.

TIBETAN MONKS TO PERFORM ANCIENT RITUAL DANCES IN S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the world watched in horror as Chinese troops crushed the fledgling 
student democratic movement in Tien An Men square, Tibetans could take small 
comfort in knowing that they were observing an all-too-familiar pattern of 
harsh repression. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950, Tibetans have watched their 
protests brutally suppressed. But 12 Tibetan monks from the Dalai Lama's 
Namgyal Monastery won't give up. Through public performances on their first 
American tour, the monks are demonstrating here by performing an ancient ritual 
dance that depicts the destruction of forces threatening Tibetan Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
The local performance, a free outdoor event sponsored by San Diego's Center for 
World Music and Related Arts, will take place at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday in the 
Balboa Park Organ Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Among the rituals being performed on the tour is the "Black Hat Dance," a 
traditional reenactment of a 10th-Century event -- the assassination of the 
oppressor-king Lang-Dar-Mar. But it assumes new relevance after nearly 40 years 
of Chinese occupation of Tibet and the recent brutal crackdowns on nationalist 
feeling within the Himalayan country. 
</P>
<P>
"What is going on in Beijing is absolutely nothing compared to what has been 
going on for years in Tibet and the hinterlands," said actor Richard Gere, 
chairman of the New York-based Tibet House, which is sponsoring the monks' 
tour. "I have been talking about this for years." 
</P>
<P>
Gere, who has studied with the Dalai Lama, describes himself as "a student of 
Buddhism" for 15 years. He was one of the founders of Tibet House, a nonprofit 
organization established in 1987 in New York "to save the culture of Tibet." 
</P>
<P>
The monks -- exiles and children of exiles living in India -- say that their 
art represents a bulwark against cultural genocide. 
</P>
<P>
"Genocide? Definitely, that is what's happening," said Lobsang Samten, 37, one 
of the monks, speaking through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are wiping out the whole culture. This is a time when Tibet and 
what it represents could be lost to the whole world, the world community. 
</P>
<P>
"What's also important is not only Tibetan culture, but any culture that is 
actually part of the universal culture. It's important that that not be allowed 
to degenerate or be destroyed or lost." 
</P>
<P>
The monks see their U.S. tour as a way of preserving the culture and countering 
government propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we're doing this tour of ritual dances is for the purpose of 
sharing with the rest of the world Tibetan culture and religion and the Tibetan 
situation, and because there are many people who have not heard anything except 
for propaganda that the Communist Chinese have sent," said Samten. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the tour will help house, clothe, feed and educate the refugees 
who continue to flee the Chinese occupation and arrive daily at the Namgyal 
Monastery, where the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and political leader of Tibet, 
took refuge in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama is regarded by his 6 million followers in Tibet and about 
100,000 emigrant Tibetans as the 14th reincarnation of a Buddhist deity. 
(Although he is the supreme leader only of the followers of the Tibetan sect, 
the Dalai Lama commands wide respect from the estimated 300,000 Buddhists in 
Southern California.) 
</P>
<P>
How serious is the situation in Tibet? 
</P>
<P>
Gere said that 1 1/2 million Tibetans have been killed. "That's one-sixth of 
the population. Now there are 7 1/2 million Chinese in Tibet (through the 
government's civilian population transfer policy), which makes the Tibetans a 
minority in their own country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider how quickly this was done to such an extraordinarily 
developed culture, it's really heartbreaking." 
</P>
<P>
Further horrors were catalogued in testimony delivered to the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee on Sept. 17, 1987, by John F. Avedon, author of "In Exile 
From the Land of Snows: the First Full Account of the Dalai Lama and Tibet 
Since the Chinese Conquest": 
</P>
<P>
"In sum, a 2,100-year-old civilization was essentially destroyed in a mere 20 
years." 
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan religion is complex. The ritual dances, although performed in 
brightly colored brocade robes and various striking masks and headpieces, are 
not mere entertainment, either for the spectators or the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important reason for performing these ritual dances . . . is to be 
able to eliminate or annihilate the disturbing emotions or mental afflictions," 
said Samten. 
</P>
<P>
That effort is directed on two levels. 
</P>
<P>
"One is for people to see," he said. "In Tibet, the people had great faith in 
the lamas or the teachers. Because they saw directly these costumes and these 
dancers, they had a feeling that they were seeing the Buddhas and very holy 
beings, which created happiness in their minds. That's one level. 
</P>
<P>
"On another level, performing the dances helped to increase the Tantric level 
meditations that the monks were doing. Based on that, it's believed that the 
audience receives a blessing by coming to see dances that represent enlightened 
beings -- a blessing that invokes, for the purpose of peace, a more peaceful 
state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
The dances will be authentic in costume and choreography but will be greatly 
shortened from the originals. The "Black Hat Dance," for instance, takes three 
days when done at the Year End Ceremony. Explanatory commentary will be 
provided before each dance. 
</P>
<P>
Although the steps may look simple, behind each dance is a complex symbolism 
and philosophy. The purpose of the "Lords of the Cemetery" dance, performed by 
four men in red skeleton costumes and grinning masks, for instance, is "to 
re-create the memory of impermanence," Samten said. 
</P>
<P>
"For the audience to remember impermanence and for each of the dancers to think 
about impermanence while they're doing the dance. 
</P>
<P>
"Some ritual dances can be learned very easily and very quickly within a couple 
of months," he said. Others, because of the complexity of the movement, 
learning of the chants and understanding the symbolism, "are much more 
complicated and require several years of training." 
</P>
<P>
An example is the Offering Dance within the Kalachakra Initiation. "I've been a 
monk for 18 years and I've been studying it during that time," said Samten. 
"But still I don't consider myself to have really learned it well." 
</P>
<P>
Does he ever expect to perform it in Tibet? 
</P>
<P>
"Always we have the great wish to return to Tibet," he said, citing three 
reasons for the hope. "One is that the political situation of the whole world 
is constantly changing, and, two, the political situation in China, as we can 
see, also is constantly changing. 
</P>
<P>
"And the third and most important reason is that everyone in the world wants to 
be happy and wants peace. And because everyone respects peace, everyone wants 
peace, they will support peaceful movements."

Mary Martin's longstanding record for the number of times she had her hair 
washed onstage is about to be broken. During her legendary run in "South 
Pacific" (beginning in 1949), Martin washed that man right out of her hair 837 
times. On Saturday, actress Rosemary Prinz -- one of the original cast members 
of the New York production of "Steel Magnolias" -- will celebrate 838 stage 
shampooings. The beauty parlor-set show (currently represented locally at the 
Wilshire) has played at the off-Broadway Lucille Lortel Theatre since June 19, 
1987. Claudia Puig

An appreciation of the arts around the globe is set to begin today in Mexico 
City when 23 groups of artists and performers from the United States and a 
dozen other countries take part in Mexico's inaugural arts festival. Mexico 
City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis told a news conference that the festival will 
include performances by French mime Marcel Marceau and readings of the late 
Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges' poems, as well as exhibitions of paintings 
and sculptures. The Israel Philharmonic, Argentine singer Mercedes Sosa and the 
Moscow School of Dramatic Arts will also perform at the festival, along with 
groups from other Latin American countries, Spain, and Poland. "The festival's 
programs will reflect the best of culture in the world," Camacho said Friday. 
The festival will run until Sept. 10. Claudia Puig

POP CAPSULES : THELONIOUS MONSTER'S LOVABLE LOUDMOUTH

Sometimes it looked as if Thelonious Monster's Bob Forrest could hardly wait 
for a song to end so he could start talking during Friday's concert at the 
Palace. Not that he shortchanged the music, but really, there's all this stuff 
going on. Can you believe the Dodgers? Is anybody actually going to pay money 
to see the Who and the Stones? The Palace is OK, but don't mess with the 
bouncers. Guess what my kid did today? Forrest also discoursed on his career, 
his girlfriend and Michael Jordan; made fun of Tone Loc, and got some girls to 
join the guys in stage-diving. 
</P>
<P>
Forrest is the David Lee Roth of L.A.'s street-rock set: different values, but 
still the lovable loudmouth. Like Roth, he's both hero and pal to his audience, 
taking them through days they recognize and share. They're days of staying one 
step ahead -- borrowing $20, going to the bank and the 7-Eleven, making the 
gig. 
</P>
<P>
This quintet isn't just attitude: "So What if I Did" is simply one of the best 
songs to ever come out of the L.A. rock scene. With the players hitting Byrds 
and Love L.A. rock grooves and then cranking up a punkish, bluesish blur with 
the wall-of-pain power of old Crazy Horse, Thelonious Monster is making a fair 
bid to join Mott the Hoople in the Glorious Failure Hall of Fame.RICHARD

A SLIMMED-DOWN 27TH CABRILLO FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After exceeding its budget of $375,000 by $25,000 last year, the Cabrillo 
Festival leadership has tightened its belt for the 27th annual summer music 
festival, in and around this slow-paced, Central California beachfront town. 
</P>
<P>
In the summers 1986-88, Cabrillo held forth in a tent on the University of 
California campus north of downtown, high on a hill overlooking the population 
center. In 1989, "for economic reasons," according to executive director 
Michael Stamp, the festival has returned to locales mostly closer in and 
predominantly churchly: Of the 12 concerts this month, 10 of them are scheduled 
in houses of religion. 
</P>
<P>
The basic problem, since the first Cabrillo Music Festival in 1963, remains. 
Viable concert halls seating more than 540 people -- the capacity of Cabrillo 
College Auditorium, original home of the festival -- simply do not exist at 
this end of Monterey Bay. 
</P>
<P>
For 1990, no decisions have been made. "We may return to the tent, or we may 
not," says Stamp. "Coming back to town is probably temporary." Not 
coincidentally, he adds, the 1989 festival budget has been pared to a 
manageable $311,000. 
</P>
<P>
The happy concertgoers at the second, third and fourth performances of the 1989 
series, Friday and Saturday and First Congregational and Holy Cross churches, 
showed no outward signs of festival burnout. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did they have any reason to. The Friday night orchestral concert, led 
vigorously by Neil Varon, an American conductor who has held major posts in 
Dusseldorf for most of the past decade, displayed the 1989 ensemble to best 
advantage in exposing scores by Robert Erickson, Shostakovich and Brahms. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday afternoon performance, also at First Congregational, gave the same 
orchestra more opportunities for showing off -- colorful pieces by American 
composers writing between 1912 and 1948. Again, the ensemble shone. 
</P>
<P>
And a stand-and-cheer reception erupted after the second and final installment 
in cellist Janos Starker's and pianist Dennis Russell Davies' Beethoven cycle 
Saturday night in Holy Cross Church, downtown. Holy Cross is arguably the 
spiritual home of this festival; many of the memorable performances in these 26 
years have taken place here. 
</P>
<P>
Since those early days -- Gerhard Samuel was the founding conductor of Cabrillo 
-- inspired cronyism has been a hallmark of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Davies, music director since 1974, while finding fresh compositional voices, 
esoteric scores and new musical personalities to present here, has also created 
a core group of solo and orchestral personnel. Continuity among its 
participants accounts for some of the high artistic standards the festival has 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Starker, a longtime Cabrillo visitor, gave, with his friend 
Davies, a memorable Beethoven performance, topped off by a seraphic and probing 
reading of the D-major Sonata, Opus 102, No. 2. In a world overfilled with 
cello virtuosos, Starker remains the model of musical elegance -- noble of 
statement, gorgeous but lean tone and stylistic pertinence. Davies' resourceful 
and commanding pianism matched his partner effortlessly. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, the 1989 orchestra supported Starker and violinist William 
Preucil strongly in a rousing and solid account of Brahms' Double Concerto. 
Conductor Varon found the propelling elements in Shostakovich's often-neglected 
First Symphony and, apparently, most of the colors in Erickson's brilliant 
"Auroras" of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Music by Virgil Thomson, John Becker, Charles Wakefield Cadman, William Grant 
Still, William Schuman and Leonard Bernstein -- much of it unfamiliar -- made 
up the fascinating, 60-minute program at the Saturday afternoon concert. Ken 
Harrison, one of the festival's founding musicians, conducted gamely, though he 
said more than he needed to between pieces.

'TIBETAN RITUAL DANCE' IN UCLA'S ROYCE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How often does an audience watch dancers spiritually prepare for a performance? 
How often is an audience instructed to prepare itself in the same way? 
</P>
<P>
"Dances From the Diamond Realm: Tibetan Ritual Dance of Namgyal Monastery" 
certainly began on the right track, Friday in Royce Hall, UCLA. "This is not a 
theater," declared actor Richard Gere, chairman of Tibet House (a co-sponsor of 
the tour). "This is now a celestial mansion." 
</P>
<P>
Both Gere and narrator Philippe Goldin helped clarify the proper Tantric 
context of the program -- explaining the purpose and symbolism of these dances 
by 17 monks of the Dalai Lama's own monastery (now located at Dharamsala, 
India) and reminding us that they usually take many hours or even days to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by deep-toned chant, blaring woodwinds, and the bleats of horns 
twice as large as the men who played them, the excerpts that followed provided 
quick takes on ancient, fabled relics of an endangered culture. 
</P>
<P>
Here was "The Dance of the Cemetery Lords" (performed last September at the 
Philosophical Research Society by the far less opulently costumed monks of 
Drepung Loseling Monastery), with its four skeleton-figures wagging their 
gleaming skull-masks and scooping the air with their talon-fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, was a gentle, eloquent solo, "The Deer Dance," full of sweet 
benediction: graceful gestures out from the mouth of the animal mask that 
seemed to represent both speech and a gift to those within the sweep of the 
dancer's arms. The lyric, processional "Kalachakra Offering Dance" involved its 
five unmasked dancers in intricate sequencing patterns. The powerful, weighty 
"Black Hat Dance" included subtle manipulation of scarfs and tassels. And the 
narrative "Dance of the Old Man" (originally from Mongolia) contained a wealth 
of charming character mime. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this highlights program couldn't suggest how the formal repetitions 
and sustained energy of Tibetan ritual manipulate time for the observer -- and 
it can scarcely represent the real thing for the monks themselves. A few 
moments of the characteristic intense, dynamic turns on one foot (the other 
flexed at knee-height) do look remarkable, but what kind of concentration does 
it take to continue, full-out, for hours? The Namgyal monks left us 
unenlightened. 
</P>
<P>
A pity -- and possibly needless. Weaned on minimalism, butoh and other 
cyclical, process-oriented movement forms, the contemporary American dance 
audience might just be ready to look at unabridged Tibetan ritual and 
appreciate (if not enter into) its sense of expanded consciousness. A 
performance that, at the very least, offered one extended excerpt after 
intermission (instead of more snippets) could have relieved some of the 
frustration that possibly existed on both sides of the footlights on Friday.

KUNZEL CONDUCTS COLE PORTER AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erich Kunzel has become something of a Hollywood Bowl fixture: The pops maestro 
has been making annual visits to Cahuenga Pass since 1983. For the last couple 
of summers, his programs have been salutes to Broadway, and Friday's concert 
(repeated Saturday) followed that pattern with a "Cole Porter Celebration." 
</P>
<P>
Kunzel knows how to pace a program, alternating styles and tempos, allowing 
just enough applause before moving on to the next selection and programming an 
ensemble number every so often. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the three soloists on this occasion sang with assured polish and potent 
vibrancy, aided by a generally cooperative sound system. Katherine Terrell, 
Lewis Dale von Schlanbusch and Neil Jones delivered the words with utter 
clarity, to which they added delightfully entertaining, frequently humorous 
stage motions. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the evening one was reminded of how extraordinarily witty a lyricist 
Porter was; songs such as "Let's Do It" (from "Paris") "You're the Top" (from 
"Anything Goes") and "Brush Up Your Shakespeare" (from "Kiss Me, Kate") attest 
both to that and his genius as a melodist. 
</P>
<P>
Forty members of the Los Angeles Master Chorale brought vitality and expression 
to the ensemble selections, although their words did not always emerge clearly. 
</P>
<P>
Kunzel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic began each half with a propulsively 
delivered overture consisting of some effective, uncredited arrangements. 
During the vocal selections, the orchestra played with precision and 
sensitivity, reinforcing but never overshadowing the soloists. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the 12,552 listeners could not resist humming along with the music.

INDIA'S BHARATA NATYAM AT THE JAPAN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though tracing its origins to before 300 BC, Bharata Natyam, the classical 
dance idiom of southern India, is nonetheless an evolving art form. One major 
area of recent experimentation has been in going beyond the traditional 
restriction to a solo dancer -- who fluidly interprets a number of characters 
in a single piece -- to introducing several dancers on stage at once. 
</P>
<P>
The Dhananjayan family -- Padmashri V.P., Shanta and their 14-year-old son 
Satyajit -- provided impressive examples of both formats Saturday at the Japan 
America Theatre. The Dhananjayans are from India; their concert was sponsored 
by the local Shakti Foundation for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The two elder Dhananjayans actually found a creative, easy link between 
traditional and new in the question-and-answer format of the hourlong dance 
drama, "Shiva Shakti Vel." This allowed a sequence of brilliant solos to flow 
naturally one after one another as Parvati questions her consort, Lord Shiva, 
about cosmic matters. 
</P>
<P>
Those issues resolved, the two found renewed bliss in passages of fluent 
mirror-image symmetries, followed by a sequence leading to the birth of a son 
who would help gods and mankind slay ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was Dhananjayan's solo depiction of Shiva taming the Ganga (a.k.a. 
Ganges) by letting the river flow through his hair that drew a spontaneous 
ovation from the largely Indian audience. 
</P>
<P>
The program had opened with a series of solo works, heavily weighted in the 
direction of "expressive" dance, in which mime and gesture predominated in 
interpreting a text. More movement-involved works were danced by the 
already-accomplished and still-promising young Satyajit. 
</P>
<P>
Dhananjayan gave informative spoken introductions to each of the dances, 
regularly indicating key mime or gestural motifs. 
</P>
<P>
Providing excellent musical support were vocalist Reji George, flutist R. 
Gopinath and drummer N. D. Kannan. CHRIS PASLES

PLANNERS SPLIT ON HOW TO MEET NUCLEAR THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT C. TOTH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1957, just before Sputnik, two alarmed emissaries from President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower visited U.S. Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay, head of the Strategic Air 
Command, in Omaha. Their calculations, they said, showed that virtually none of 
SAC's bombers could escape a surprise Soviet air attack, even with the several 
hours of warning time that then was expected. 
</P>
<P>
"You're right," LeMay agreed. But he was unconcerned, he explained, because U-2 
spy planes were regularly flying over the Soviet Union and would give him a 
week's warning for a preemptive strike if the Soviets began massing their 
planes for attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll knock the s--- out of them before they get off the ground," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But Gen. LeMay," one thunderstruck civilian objected, "that's not national 
policy." U.S. policy, laid down by Eisenhower, called for retaliatory strikes 
in response to Soviet aggression. 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's not national policy," LeMay admitted. "But it's my policy." 
</P>
<P>
The exchange, recounted for the Public Broadcasting Service by the two 
emissaries, industrialist Robert Sprague and educator Jerome Weisner, provides 
the earliest evidence of U.S. plans for launching its nuclear weapons in a 
preemptive attack when warned that an enemy is about to strike. 
</P>
<P>
And more than that, it reflects a profound split that exists to this day 
between advocates of two very different strategies for achieving what is 
arguably the single most important goal of the U.S. government -- positioning 
the nation so that the Soviets will find it unthinkable to start a war. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an emerging crisis of confidence today in the theory of nuclear 
deterrence and its implementation," said an experienced military strategist who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
George P. Shultz, former President Ronald Reagan's secretary of state, forecast 
as he left office in January that 20 years from now, "there will be something 
else in place" of the current deterrence doctrine. Some experts, including 
those who invented it, believe that the change will come even earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Current doctrine represents a standoff between the two basic strategies for 
deterring a Soviet attack: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Retaliatory. This strategy, preferred by Eisenhower and most U.S. political 
leaders since, is based on the premise that the Soviets will never use their 
own nuclear weapons as long as they know that U.S. missiles are poised to 
annihilate their population centers and demolish their industrial base. It 
threatens maximum punishment for aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 -- War fighting, also known as counterforce. This approach, long favored by 
the U.S. military, holds that the best way to prevent an enemy attack is to 
strike Soviet missile sites and troop locations as soon as the Soviets prepare 
to launch their own weapons or while their weapons are en route. 
</P>
<P>
A preemptive strike was LeMay's approach, and the current SAC commander -- 
although far more tightly constrained by presidential orders than LeMay was 
three decades ago -- has much the same philosophy. "One of the first things you 
want to do in a war is shoot at what's shooting at you," Gen. John T. Chain Jr. 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The counterforce strategy has the goal of bringing the United States out of any 
war in better shape than the adversary. One expert described it as "war 
fighting toward victory." 
</P>
<P>
It requires weapons that are quick and accurate. They must be launched rapidly 
to escape a surprise attack and arrive quickly to catch enemy forces on the 
ground. And they must be accurate enough to destroy fortified, or "hardened," 
Soviet military installations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carrying Inherent Risks 
</P>
<P>
But such weapons carry inherent risks. The larger and better they are, the 
greater their potential to carry out a surprise attack. And the more the 
Soviets worry about a surprise attack, the more likely they are to build 
comparable forces and to press their own nuclear button -- to "use it or lose 
it," in the vernacular of nuclear strategists -- in a crisis. That, in turn, 
increases the risk of a deliberate or accidental nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
Declared official U.S. policy today is not to launch missiles merely upon 
warning of a Soviet attack but to be in a position to "ride out" any surprise 
strike before retaliating. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States does not rely on its capability for launch-on-warning or 
launch-under-attack to ensure the credibility of its deterrent," former Defense 
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said shortly before leaving office in January. 
Carlucci was reflecting the policy determination that it would be foolhardy to 
launch missiles on the strength of signals from radar and other imperfect 
sensors that an attack is occurring. 
</P>
<P>
The retaliatory strategy, compared with war fighting, is less expensive and 
demanding. Once called massive retaliation and later mutually assured 
destruction, or MAD, it requires fewer, less accurate weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retaliate With Certainty 
</P>
<P>
But these weapons, if they are to deter aggressors from striking first, must be 
able to survive an enemy attack and retaliate with certainty. Their command 
network must be highly secure and reliable, to ensure that the order to 
retaliate will be transmitted from the surviving leadership to the military 
commanders. 
</P>
<P>
To its critics, the retaliatory strategy is immoral and not credible: immoral 
because it targets cities with huge civilian populations; not credible because 
it would not satisfy U.S. allies in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The European matter is complicated. Because the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization lacks sufficient conventional forces, its policy has long been to 
use U.S. nuclear weapons to counter a Soviet invasion, even one that used only 
conventional weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But such U.S. nuclear retaliation against Soviet society in turn would assure a 
Soviet nuclear attack on U.S. cities, an outcome that no U.S. President would 
want to invite. Europeans doubt that the United States, in fact, would "commit 
suicide" by striking the Soviet homeland with nuclear weapons in this situation 
and thus consider the purely retaliatory strategy not credible. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to allay this fear and yet extend its deterrence umbrella over 
Western Europe, the United States and NATO have adopted an uncertain mixture of 
the retaliatory and war-fighting doctrines. The compromise strategy is called 
"flexible response." 
</P>
<P>
Under it, the United States would respond, with nuclear weapons if necessary, 
to any Soviet aggression, conventional or nuclear. The response would consist 
of small, carefully tailored strikes beginning at the battlefield level, but 
not aimed immediately at Soviet urban targets. These attacks would escalate to 
bigger and deeper strikes -- and eventually to an all-out exchange of 
intercontinental weapons, if the war were not halted. 
</P>
<P>
Flexible response, first spelled out by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara in 
1965, has been the basis of successive U.S. nuclear war plans since then. 
</P>
<P>
Its first priority is to be capable of inflicting "unacceptable damage on an 
attacker," defined as destroying at least one-fifth of the Soviet population 
and one-half of Soviet industry. McNamara calculated that such damage would 
take 400 one-megaton weapons (one megaton is the equivalent of 1 million tons 
of TNT.) That feature of flexible response is retaliatory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counterforce Option 
</P>
<P>
Its second priority is to limit damage to the United States and its allies, if 
war should come, by striking at least some enemy weapons that had not yet been 
launched. That is essentially the counterforce option. 
</P>
<P>
Based on these principles, the current version of the Single Integrated 
Operations Plan, called SIOP-6, allocates 12,000 to 13,000 warheads and bombs 
in the U.S. strategic arsenal to Soviet targets in the following order of 
importance: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nuclear forces. These include 1,386 Soviet ICBM silos in about 30 missile 
fields, plus about 300 missile command centers, 500 airfields suitable for 
long-range bombers and at least three submarine bases in the Arctic and the 
North Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Conventional military forces. Among them are about 170 infantry and armored 
division bases, 16 air defense command headquarters, five naval fleet 
headquarters, about 70 military radio stations that handle low-frequency or 
satellite communications and various other non-nuclear military targets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Military and political leadership. At least equal priority is given to 
several hundred command-and-control facilities for top Soviet leaders, 
including the deep bunkers and hardened shelters that have been built for tens 
of thousands of the Soviet Communist Party and management elite. 
</P>
<P>
 -- War-supporting industrial-urban sites. Chief among these are about 200 
urban complexes containing 50% of key Soviet industry and six rail 
transshipment yards that load 80% of rail cars. Beyond that, about 700 Soviet 
cities have populations of more than 25,000. Then there are electrical power 
stations, steel mills and other facilities associated with war-making 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
While most of these targets are dictated by a counterforce strategy, SIOP-6 
also encompasses the key element of the retaliatory strategy: It is designed to 
allow the United States to absorb a surprise Soviet attack, with or without 
warning, and still respond with assured destruction. 
</P>
<P>
If an attack caught U.S. forces operating at their normal level of alert, 
between 3,500 and 5,000 weapons, mostly from submarines and bombers, could 
still be launched in retaliation, according to Edward L. Warner III and David 
Ochmanek of the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, writing in "Next Moves." If the 
United States were alerted in advance by intelligence information, twice as 
many weapons -- 8,000 to 10,000 -- could respond. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, even before McNamara formalized the doctrine of flexible 
response, U.S. nuclear strategy has reflected the opposing tugs of the 
retaliatory and counterforce strategies, shifting back and forth over the 
years, emphasizing one but never excluding the other. 
</P>
<P>
The old adage, that generals prepare to fight the last war, carried over into 
the nuclear age. Initially, U.S. nuclear war plans were an extension of the 
Army Air Corps' strategic bombing campaign of World War II and called for a 
spasm of total destruction on Soviet cities. 
</P>
<P>
When LeMay made his own deterrent policy, the United States had overwhelming 
nuclear superiority and treated nuclear weapons as if they were just bigger 
TNT-filled bombs. As the Soviets developed nuclear weapons, U.S. targeting 
priority quickly switched from cities to aim at those weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"The era of nuclear plenty" began in the 1950s. The 1948 Berlin Crisis and the 
Korean War of 1950-53 provided political spurs for a U.S. military buildup. At 
the same time, nuclear weapons became cheaper, promising "more bang for the 
buck," and could be compressed into increasingly smaller packages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From 50 to 18,000 
</P>
<P>
From a mere 50 atomic bombs in 1948 -- bombs that took two dozen men two days 
to assemble -- the U.S. arsenal grew to 1,000 bombs by the end of the Korean 
War. By 1960, the United States had 18,000 nuclear weapons: more than 3,000 
strategic bombs and missile warheads and the rest smaller devices, from 
torpedoes to artillery shells, deployed throughout the world, most of them in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The age of technological spying had also dawned. Photographs from the U-2 plane 
and later from satellites, together with electronic eavesdropping, provided 
increasing intelligence on the size, location and character of Soviet forces. 
As the list of these potential targets grew, it was used to justify military 
requests for more and more weapons to attack them, a process known as 
"bootstrapping." 
</P>
<P>
Rivalries between the Air Force and Navy, and the overlapping responsibilities 
of the four theater commands with nuclear weapons -- SAC and the Atlantic, 
Pacific and European theaters -- led to enormous overkill, interference and 
conflicting attacks in the war plans prepared by each commander. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An All-Encompassing Plan 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to bring some coherence to the nuclear war planning process, 
Eisenhower ordered that all the plans be coordinated into one all-encompassing 
Single Integrated Operations Plan to be drawn up by a special targeting staff 
at SAC headquarters in Omaha with presidential guidance. The director of the 
staff would be the SAC commander, who is always an Air Force general, with a 
Navy admiral as his deputy. 
</P>
<P>
But the maze of competing bureaucracies provided then, and still provides 
today, an opportunity for the military to twist the SIOP's guidance to its own 
ends, several authorities on targeting say. At times White House orders have 
been vague or inadequately thought out, these experts admit, but much of the 
distortion seemed intended simply to boost requirements for more and more 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Eisenhower directed in the first SIOP in 1960 that the first 
priority was to hit Soviet strategic nuclear weapons facilities, the second was 
to strike its military and government command centers and the third was to hit 
its urban-industrial centers. In fact, because there were so few targets in the 
first two categories, the urban centers were the main focus of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Weapons Needed 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, interpreting the President's order, decided that there should be 
75% assurance that all the targets would be hit. But the SIOP, prepared under 
SAC's control, set the delivery assurance level much higher: well over 90% for 
more than half the 1,050 targets at the time. To achieve such high assurance, 
multiple strikes with high-yield weapons were required. Therefore, many more 
weapons were needed. 
</P>
<P>
The result, complained George B. Kistiakowsky, Eisenhower's science adviser, 
was a demand for "tremendous additional forces." Equally appalling was the 
enormous overkill built into the plan. 
</P>
<P>
For example, SAC allocated 300-kiloton weapons (equal to 300,000 tons of TNT) 
to do the same amount of damage as the 13-kiloton bomb that destroyed 
Hiroshima. About 60 weapons were to detonate within Moscow's city limits, which 
would have left not a tree or building standing. Between 360 million and 450 
million people in the Sino-Soviet bloc would have been killed if the first SIOP 
had been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, said Eisenhower, "frightened the devil out of me." But he signed it 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
President John F. Kennedy, also appalled at the Armageddon mapped out in the 
first SIOP, specified that priority in the next SIOP would go to targeting "the 
enemy's military forces, not his civilian population." That is, he wanted to 
emphasize counterforce doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult and Expensive 
</P>
<P>
But McNamara, his defense secretary, quickly learned that such a strategy was 
difficult and expensive to implement. To destroy each new Soviet weapon would 
require two or three accurate U.S. weapons. The Air Force, seizing the new 
opportunity, immediately asked for a force of 10,000 Minuteman ICBMs. The Joint 
Chiefs cut the request to 3,000, and McNamara approved only 1,000. That number 
has been considered sufficient to this day. 
</P>
<P>
For political reasons, McNamara continued to publicly endorse the counterforce 
strategy, while inside the Pentagon, he sought to persuade the Air Force to 
de-emphasize it. But in the end he gave up trying to turn SAC targeters away 
from counterforce, and the result was that, through the 1960s, there was little 
real change in U.S. targeting practices. 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon Administration spent six years trying to rein in the Pentagon. It did 
so in 1974 by creating a new category of targets -- economic facilities whose 
loss would impede the enemy's "ability to recover." The move would turn out to 
be a massive mistake. 
</P>
<P>
No one knew which industries were critical to the Soviets' recovery from war. 
So virtually all facilities that might contribute to economic recovery were 
targeted. Fertilizer plants, for example, were on the list because fertilizer 
increases crop yields. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quadrupling of Targets 
</P>
<P>
This led to a quadrupling of industrial targets in the SIOP. Then it was 
discovered that too little was known about how economies recover from war even 
to attempt the counter-recovery mission. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, after the SIOP had been badly skewed by the economic recovery 
mission, the Carter Administration dropped that category from the plan in favor 
of "war-supporting industry," a narrower category that still encompasses 
urban-industrial targets. 
</P>
<P>
Its targeting guidance, known as Presidential Directive 59, issued in July, 
1980, also gave renewed emphasis to a war-fighting strategy and drew attention 
to two new types of targets: Soviet political leaders and the emerging Soviet 
mobile missile force. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration, putting Carter's guidance into effect in 1982, was 
even more inclined to war fighting and to the two new target sets. And it built 
enthusiastically upon PD-59's orders to "go after" Soviet leaders and mobile 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
Today's superpower arsenals "did not result from any coherent, calculated 
plans," said John D. Steinbruner, a Brookings Institution analyst. Such a 
claim, he has written, is "an exercise of rationalization after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the arsenals are the products of military appetites, political 
competition and technological breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. nuclear "triad" of forces consists of land-based missiles, 
submarine-based missiles and bombers. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000 land-based ICBMs are quick-starting and quick-arriving weapons that 
carry a total of 2,450 highly accurate warheads. These missiles are best suited 
for counterforce targeting against "hardened" Soviet missile silos and command 
and leadership facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The submarine-based leg of the triad consists of 608 missiles carrying 5,312 
warheads. Because of communication difficulties with submarines and because 
these warheads are less accurate than those on ICBMs, these weapons are 
primarily part of a retaliatory strategy. Many of them are aimed at non-nuclear 
military targets such as airfields and army bases. The new Trident 2 missiles 
will have accuracies rivaling ICBMs and will be increasingly used for 
counterforce targets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Last to Arrive 
</P>
<P>
The 318 nuclear bombers carry about 2,500 bombs, 1,600 air-launched cruise 
missiles and 1,100 short-range attack missiles. Because they would be the last 
to arrive, these weapons have largely retaliatory missions, although the newer 
bombers, such as the B-1 and eventually the B-2 stealth, will be targeted on 
mobile missiles and leadership bunkers inside the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. civilian analysts argue that the overly secretive U.S. plan for 
waging nuclear war has been beyond the control of civilian political leaders 
for decades and that this, in turn, has resulted in the wasteful overproduction 
of warheads and bombs, missiles and bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. McFarlane, Reagan's national security adviser from 1983 to 1985, said 
that White House officials had to go to extraordinary lengths just to get a 
small grip on the targeting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"Reagan didn't have enough personal interest in targeting doctrine to insist 
that we get access," McFarlane said in an interview. So, McFarlane said, he 
pushed for deep weapons cuts in arms control negotiations with the Soviets as a 
way to outflank the military's opposition to civilian oversight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Grossly Inflated Needs' 
</P>
<P>
"That way," he said, "we could keep the Pentagon's grossly inflated needs for 
deterrence from getting completely out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
The military, to justify resistance to White House control over the targeting 
process, recalls the confusing and amateurish efforts by President Lyndon B. 
Johnson to select individual bombing targets during the Vietnam War. "We don't 
want a nuclear Vietnam," one general said fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a civilian-run strategic review was ordered by the Reagan 
Administration, and it found telling cases of warhead waste -- three nuclear 
weapons targeted on an oil refinery, for instance, when one or at most two 
would do -- and long-overdue reforms were ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Targeters were told that they did not need to destroy 70% of every single 
factory of a selected industry in order to destroy 70% of the overall industry, 
for example. And they were directed to calculate the destructiveness of a 
weapon based not only on its immediate blast effects but also on its tremendous 
heat and radiation effects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential for Abuse 
</P>
<P>
Critics who have been inside the targeting process insist that there is still 
much potential for abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"A young captain or major can decide from a photograph that a target has some 
dirt on it that could provide additional protection," one expert explained, 
"and then he will lay down a second weapon to make sure it is destroyed. Then, 
because of the possibility that one of those weapons may fail on launch or 
misfire, the kid decides he has to 'in-line' a third weapon to get the high 
damage expectancy that is required." 
</P>
<P>
Another expert on SAC targeting said that targeters, who are ordered to avoid 
debris from earlier blasts that would tear apart an incoming warhead, once 
assumed that the stem of the nuclear dust cloud would be empty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Full of Debris' 
</P>
<P>
"In the real world, of course, the cloud would be a maelstrom full of debris," 
he said. "But they decided to 'fly' a warhead down the 'empty stem.' Crazy. And 
this was not just an idea being studied. Those orders were actually going into 
missile guidance systems when they were caught." 
</P>
<P>
Critics are not yet satisfied that the abuses have been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
"Targeting is still done like old artillery men would do it," complained one 
expert. The process has been automated, he said, but that just means that 
"instead of moving red circles on a plastic map overlay, now soft-copy image 
processors are used." 
</P>
<P>
Ashton B. Carter of Harvard University, another acknowledged expert on 
targeting, said that SAC's modernization efforts represent "only superficial 
appliques to the way they were doing business back in the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
McNamara himself, the author of today's nuclear strategy, flatly predicted 
recently that, "by the end of the century, the flexible response doctrine will 
be over or modified beyond recognition." 
</P>
<P>
But how it will be modified remains far from clear. Some of the alternatives 
are relatively utopian. 
</P>
<P>
One is deterrence built around anti-missile defenses, as epitomized by Reagan's 
Strategic Defense Initiative, known as "Star Wars." The technology is still 
decades away, however. 
</P>
<P>
Another is total nuclear disarmament. But virtually no U.S. leader except 
Reagan has seriously envisaged a world in which the superpowers discard their 
nuclear weapons, in part because other nations, including an increasing number 
in the Third World, possess the weapons or are developing them. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear weapons technology cannot be disinvented. Both the United States and 
the Soviet Union will need a nuclear arsenal to deter mischief by the "lesser" 
nuclear powers as well as to balance the significant nuclear forces possessed 
by China, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eroding Soviets' Claim 
</P>
<P>
Even the Soviets do not really want zero, according to Arnold Horelick, 
director of the RAND Corp.-UCLA Center for Soviet Studies, even though their 
president, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, has repeatedly called for a world without 
nuclear weapons. Eliminating nuclear weapons, Horelick said, would greatly 
erode the Soviet claim to superpower status. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that no changes are on the way. The component of the 
flexible response doctrine that is most vulnerable today is the counterforce 
strategy, in large part because it requires enormous arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a crossroads with respect to counterforce targeting," said Leon 
Sloss, a respected strategist who directed the Carter Administration's nuclear 
review. "There are three alternatives. Either we have a massive (counterforce) 
effort to get at mobile targets, or we get away from counterforce and back 
toward some form of massive retaliation. Or we have to shift emphasis to 
targeting Soviet general-purpose military forces rather than nuclear forces." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Possible Consensus 
</P>
<P>
A consensus may be forming around the concept of a minimal retaliation 
capability -- two or more multiples of McNamara's 400 one-megaton weapons, for 
example -- plus minimal counterforce capability that make credible some limited 
use of nuclear weapons as long as the Soviets have superior conventional forces 
in Europe. But this will still mean arsenals of at least 2,000 or 3,000 
strategic weapons on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
So it is clear that for many years to come, deterrence will rest on the threat 
of nuclear offensive weapons in the superpower arsenals. But the overall size 
of these forces on both sides can still be greatly reduced in a stable manner 
to lessen their cost and the risk of accidental or panicky use in a crisis.

MEXICO REACHES ACCORD ON RESTRUCTURING DEBT; 
</P>
<P>
AGREEMENT WITH FOREIGN LENDERS TO PROVIDE NEW LOANS, WILL EASE NATION'S OVERALL 
BURDEN

<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico reached agreement in principle with foreign governments and banks Sunday 
on a massive new debt financing package -- the first under the new Third World 
debt-reduction strategy proposed last March by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas 
F. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark accord, which will provide the Mexican government with some $3 
billion in new loans and debt relief over three years, will for the first time 
reduce both the country's overall debt burden and the amount it must pay 
foreign creditors each year. The $3-billion-plus figure will come from a 
mixture of about half new loans and half debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to ease Mexico's debt burden enough to enable the government to 
finance its planned overhaul of the economy and still allow for economic 
growth. Under the previous Third World debt plan, the country's overall debt 
burden steadily increased. 
</P>
<P>
The accord was viewed as a victory for Brady and the Bush Administration, which 
had hoped to portray the Mexican agreement as a "test case" of the secretary's 
new debt-reduction plan. It also was expected to bolster politically the 
government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, whose party has been in 
increasing difficulty at home. 
</P>
<P>
The pact was announced jointly late Sunday by Salinas and a 15-member Bank 
Advisory Committee, which represents 500 U.S. and foreign commercial banks that 
have been lending regularly to Mexico over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. and Mexican officials hailed the new accord as a major turning point 
in the seven-year-old global debt problem and said they expect it to serve as a 
precedent for applying the new Brady Plan, as the debt-reduction proposal is 
known, to other large Latin American debtors. Venezuela already has begun 
negotiations with commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said the agreement is "a major step forward in the implementation of the 
strengthened (U.S.) debt strategy." He said it would provide "significant debt- 
and debt-service reduction for Mexico as well as new money to support Mexico's 
economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
President Salinas announced the agreement in a nationally televised speech, 
saying it evolved out of one of the most "complex and tense negotiations" in 
the history of Mexico and international finance. 
</P>
<P>
"This opens the trail that other countries with similar problems can convert 
into a road," Salinas said in his 15-minute speech. 
</P>
<P>
He warned the country, however, that "we cannot expect to see spectacular 
results overnight." Mexico's resumed growth will be gradual, he said, adding 
that the government will continue to support a wage and price control agreement 
signed with unions and businesses valid through next march. 
</P>
<P>
Mexicans' initial reaction to news of the agreement was glowing. "The package 
is excellent," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economist and private 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock exchange over the next week is going to go through the roof," he 
said. "Expectations in Mexico are going to be very positive. This will raise 
the optimism of the Mexican private sector in the future of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Mexican government's original assertion that it needed a 50% 
debt reduction was "just a negotiating position" and that this package is 
"absolutely enough" to turn around Mexico's stagnant economy. He predicted 
positive growth for this year of as much as 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Rubio, director of the private Banking and Finance Institute, a Mexico 
City-based think tank, said, "That sounds like a superb agreement." If debt and 
interest rate reductions are combined with new money, "it looks like an 
enormous discount, much more than what anyone had been expecting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing here was that Mexican savers and investors believe that the 
debt will be manageable and the country won't be in permanent recession," he 
said. "This package accomplishes that." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the actual reduction of a portion of Mexico's debt, Sunday's accord has 
another new element: It assures the Mexican government a continuing flow of new 
bank loans for the next four years, instead of just 12 more months. The 
Mexicans had insisted on this feature as a way to ensure stability and help 
stem the flight of capital. 
</P>
<P>
The package includes these provisions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Commercial banks that have made loans to Mexico in the past will first have 
the option of providing Mexico with new loans amounting to 25% of the total 
they have outstanding. They then will seek to reduce Mexico's debt burden on 
the rest by exchanging a portion of that debt for 30-year bonds whose interest 
payments are guaranteed with money from U.S.-issued zero-coupon bonds or money 
lent by the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. Some $7 billion 
already has been assembled for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the securities would be to reduce the portion of Mexico's debt 
that they cover by 35%. Banks that choose not to make new loans must discount a 
larger portion of their existing debt. Details of how much each bank will 
choose from each option still must be worked out, but U.S. officials estimated 
that the provision could net Mexico some $10 billion in debt reduction over 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the other options to be given commercial banks, Mexico also would 
offer to trade shares of stock in state-run corporations that it hopes to sell 
to private investors. These offerings could cover up to $1 billion a year worth 
of debt. Mexico now owes $107 billion to foreign creditors, some $54 billion of 
which is owed to commercial banks from the United States, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The interest rates for any new loans that the banks provide will be 6.25%, 
well below the 11.3% that prevailed when the current talks began or the 9.1% 
rates in force this past week. How much Mexico saves under that arrangement 
will depend upon how much in new loans the commercial banks decide to make, but 
ballpark estimates suggest that Mexico could save about $1.6 billion a year 
from the lowered interest rates. The banks also could lower interest on 
existing loans by trading them for bonds, just as they would under the 
debt-reduction portion of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In addition, both Japan and Spain will provide new loans to Mexico. Japan 
is expected to offer $2 billion in new lending. Spain's contribution has not 
yet been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As is traditional in such negotiations, Sunday's accord was only on the 
basic outlines of the agreement. Both sides said details would have to be 
worked out over the next several weeks, and Mexico may not actually realize the 
benefits of the new accord for two to three months. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, Mexico will receive some $2 billion in temporary "bridge" loans 
from other industrial countries, including the United States. How much each 
country will provide still has not been worked out. The bridge loans will be 
repaid with money from the new loans that Mexico will receive. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, the system has an answer," an ecstatic senior Mexican official said 
after the talks ended late Sunday. "The important thing here is that this is 
not just for Mexico, but that it will provide a way to help other countries 
that are suffering with this burden."

<P>
Prime Minister Sosuke Uno today announced his intention to resign after his 
ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a humiliating defeat Sunday in an 
election for the upper house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised news conference, Uno blamed the party's defeat -- its 
first in a national election since it was formed in 1955 -- on a revolt by 
housewives, farmers and shopkeepers in response to an influence-buying scandal, 
the imposition of a 3% consumption tax and moves to open Japan's agricultural 
market to imports. 
</P>
<P>
"That the campaign ended with no policy debate on these issues was regrettable. 
But the people's judgment has been given," Uno said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the responsibility belongs to me, and to make that responsibility 
clear, I have resolved to resign." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked About His Affairs 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought reports that surfaced two days after he took office June 2 
about his money-for-sex affairs affected the outcome, Uno responded, "I said I 
'assume all responsibility.' 
</P>
<P>
"I did everything I could," he said of the election. "But with this kind of 
defeat, it is only natural to assume responsibility. I feel completely serene." 
</P>
<P>
From a 17-seat majority in the last election three years ago, the conservatives 
plummeted to at least 16 seats shy of a majority in the 252-member House of 
Councillors, or upper house, of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Socialists, meanwhile, increased their holdings by at least 24 seats in the 
upper house, where all bills except the budget and treaties must be approved. 
Half the seats were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
With 5 of the 126 races yet to be determined, Socialists had outstripped the 
Liberal Democrats 45 to 36. 
</P>
<P>
Only one more Liberal Democrat still had a chance to win. The disastrous 
showing means that they have lost control of the upper house for at least the 
next six years. 
</P>
<P>
To win a majority in the next election in 1992, the party would have to elect 
nearly 90 candidates -- but its best showing ever came three years ago, when it 
won 73 seats of the 126 at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Including incumbents not up for reelection, the Liberal Democrats this time had 
nailed down 109 seats. In addition, two conservatives who won without 
endorsement were expected to join the party. All opposition forces, however, 
had 135 seats, or 8 more than needed for a simple majority of 127. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
64 Seats for Socialists 
</P>
<P>
The Socialists' winners and carryovers added up to 65 seats. 
</P>
<P>
A new pan-opposition alliance organized by the labor federation, Rengo (Japan 
Private Sector Trade Union Confederation), elected 11 of its 12 candidates and 
enlisted one carryover into its ranks. The new group, analysts said, could form 
the core of an opposition-led coalition should the Liberal Democrats lose their 
majority in a future election for the lower house, which elects the prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
The results were so overwhelming that only three hours after 65% of Japan's 
90.3 million voters finished casting ballots, NHK, the semi-official radio and 
TV network, declared the conservatives defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Although he waited until this morning, Uno himself announced his intention to 
step down before the vote counting was finished. He urged the Liberal Democrats 
to act as quickly as possible to pick a successor as party president, who would 
then be elected by the lower house of Parliament as prime minister if the past 
pattern is followed. The process could take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party Officials Told 
</P>
<P>
Uno said he made up his mind to quit Sunday night and informed party officials 
of his decision this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The move came after three ruling party leaders, including former Prime Minister 
Zenko Suzuki, called for Uno's resignation. Suzuki said the election debacle 
created "the greatest party crisis since its founding." 
</P>
<P>
Socialist Chairwoman Takako Doi said the ruling party should turn over the 
government to a Socialist-led "election-management cabinet," which would 
dissolve the lower house and call a general election. Other opposition parties 
also called for an immediate election for the lower house. Its term expires 
next July. 
</P>
<P>
In losing its 34-year-long stranglehold on legislation, the ruling party will 
be forced seek a coalition with middle-of-the-road opposition parties or to 
negotiate every bill except the budget and treaties with the opposition 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party in Disarray 
</P>
<P>
The defeat and Uno's resignation also ensured that the ruling party will remain 
in disarray with no effective leadership for an indeterminate period. By the 
party's own ruling, all of its first echelon leaders who were tainted in the 
influence-buying scandal are barred from holding party posts until next May or 
after a general election. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to a 5% real growth expected in this year's GNP, business leaders 
expressed confidence that the economy would suffer no immediate setback. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market opened today with the yen declining to 143.25 
yen to the dollar, 1.10 point below Friday's close. The Tokyo Stock Market, 
however, climbed slightly by 83.47 points to 33,982.90 by midday. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predicted that voters would adopt a more conservative attitude in 
any lower house election, where leadership of the government will be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Against, Not For 
</P>
<P>
One TV poll of voters coming out of ballot booths Sunday found that two-thirds 
of those who cast ballots for opposition candidates were voting against the 
Liberal Democrats, rather than in favor of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"We were done in," Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general, 
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto refused to single out any one issue as the cause of the landslide 
defeat. But underlying the debacle, he said, was "the voters' distrust in 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
The distrust, pollsters said, stemmed from broken promises to both consumers 
and farmers as well as voters' repulsion against the influence-buying scandal. 
Assuming responsibility for that scandal, Takeshita resigned only to see Uno, 
his hand-picked successor, embroiled in money-for-sex charges, on which Uno 
refused to comment directly. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 election, the Liberal Democrats promised to keep Japan's 
agricultural markets closed to imports and told consumers and shopkeepers they 
would not implement any large-scale indirect tax. But the party last year bowed 
to American demands and agreed to lift quotas on beef and citrus fruit imports 
by April 1, 1991, and then unilaterally rammed the consumption tax through 
Parliament last December. It was implemented April 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Farm Revolt a Key 
</P>
<P>
The farm revolt handed to the opposition all five of the rice-rich prefectures 
(states) in Tohoku (Northeast Japan) and all four prefectures on the island of 
Shikoku, a major mandarin orange-growing region. Three prefectures on the 
island of Kyushu, where cattle farmers are prominent, went to the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we explained our agricultural policies, the farmers wouldn't listen 
to us because of their distrust in politics," Hashimoto said. 
</P>
<P>
"Voters realized that if Liberal Democrat politics continued (without protest), 
their lives would be affected," said Doi, who made a promise to abolish the 
unpopular 3% consumption the centerpiece of her Socialist protest campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Doi said her party will submit a bill to abolish the consumption tax and will 
fight farm imports, as it promised during the 18-day campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democrat candidates lost their seats in the only two districts in which 
Uno campaigned, including Shiga, Uno's own home prefecture and a traditional 
conservative stronghold.

<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Sosuke Uno was reported preparing to announce his 
resignation today after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a 
humiliating defeat Sunday in an election for the upper house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Women, farmers and shopkeepers defected to the Socialist Party in record 
numbers in a tax and scandal revolt, handing the ruling party its first defeat 
in a national election since it was formed in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
NHK, the semi-governmental radio and TV network, reported that Uno was planning 
to give an unscheduled press conference to announce his intention to resign to 
accept responsibility for the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Uno reportedly informed both his chief Cabinet secretary, Masajuro Shiokawa, 
and ruling party officials of his intention to step down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13 Seats Shy of Majority 
</P>
<P>
From a 17-seat majority in the last election three years ago, the conservatives 
plummeted to at least 13 seats shy of a majority in the 252-member House of 
Councillors, or upper house, of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Socialists, meanwhile, increased their holdings by at least 18 seats in the 
upper house, where all bills except the budget and treaties must be approved. 
Half the seats were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
With 21 of the 126 races yet to be determined, Socialists had outstripped the 
Liberal Democrats 40 to 31. 
</P>
<P>
The results were so overwhelming that only three hours after 65% of Japan's 
90.3 million voters finished casting ballots, NHK declared the conservatives 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
In losing its stranglehold on legislation, the ruling party will be forced to 
seek a coalition with middle-of-the-road opposition parties or to negotiate 
every bill with the opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
Three ruling party leaders immediately called for Uno's resignation -- also 
without waiting for the final vote tally. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that the outcome had created "the greatest party crisis since its 
founding," former Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki demanded that responsibility for 
the debacle be "made clear." Toshio Komoto, a former deputy prime minister, 
also called for an accounting of "responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Party elder Raizo Matsuno was more direct. "It will be impossible for a prime 
minister defeated in an election to continue to carry out politics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Major factional leaders, however, refused to comment or offered vague support 
for Uno to stay in office until the term he inherited from Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita ends Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders immediately called for Uno's resignation and an early 
dissolution of the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
Including incumbents not up for reelection, the Liberal Democrats had nailed 
down 104 seats, compared to 60 for the Socialists. All opposition forces, 
however, had already secured 127 seats -- exactly equal to a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
No more than 10 additional Liberal Democrats still held hopes of winning seats. 
</P>
<P>
A new pan-opposition alliance organized by the labor federation Rengo (Japan 
Private Sector Trade Union Confederation) elected 11 of its 12 candidates. The 
new group, analysts said, could form the core of an opposition-led coalition 
should the Liberal Democrats lose their majority in a future election for the 
lower house, which elects the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The result ensured that the ruling party will remain in disarray, with no 
effective leadership for an unpredictable period. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to a 5% real growth expected in this year's gross national product, 
however, business leaders expressed confidence that the economy would suffer no 
immediate setback. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market, however, opened today with the yen declining 
to 143.25 yen to the dollar, 1.10 points below Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predicted that voters would adopt a more conservative attitude in 
any lower house election, where leadership of the government will be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
One TV survey of voters leaving the polls Sunday found that two-thirds of those 
who cast ballots for opposition candidates were voting against the Liberal 
Democrats, rather than in favor of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distrust Among Voters Cited 
</P>
<P>
"We were done in," Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general, 
conceded. Hashimoto refused to single out any one issue as the cause of the 
landslide defeat. But underlying the debacle, he said, was "the voters' 
distrust in politics." 
</P>
<P>
The distrust, pollsters said, stemmed from broken promises to both consumers 
and farmers as well as the voters' repulsion to a widespread influence-buying 
scandal that tainted all of the ruling party's major factional leaders. That 
scandal forced the resignation of Takeshita, but his handpicked successor, Uno, 
become embroiled in a new scandal over money-for-sex charges two days after he 
took office June 2. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 election, the Liberal Democrats promised to keep Japan's 
agricultural markets closed to imports and told consumers and shopkeepers that 
they would not implement any large-scale indirect tax. But the party last year 
bowed to American demands and agreed to lift quotas on beef and citrus fruit 
imports by April 1, 1991, and then unilaterally rammed a 3% consumption tax 
through Parliament last December. It was implemented April 1. 
</P>
<P>
The farm revolt helped the opposition, as it won all five of the rice-rich 
prefectures (states) in Tohoku (northeast Japan) and all four prefectures on 
the island of Shikoku, a major mandarin orange-growing region. Three 
prefectures on the island of Kyushu, where cattle farmers are prominent, went 
to the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Farmers Wouldn't Listen' 
</P>
<P>
"Although we explained our agricultural policies, the farmers wouldn't listen 
to us because of their distrust in politics," the ruling party's Hashimoto 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Voters realized that if Liberal Democrat politics continued (without protest), 
their lives would be affected," said Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Socialist 
Party, who made her opposition to the consumption tax the centerpiece of her 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Doi said the party would submit a bill to abolish the tax and said her party 
would fight farm imports, as it promised during the 18-day campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democratic candidates lost their seats in the only two districts in 
which Uno campaigned, including Shiga, Uno's home prefecture and a traditional 
conservative stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
The upset winner in Shiga was one of the Rengo labor federation-backed 
candidates. Another Rengo winner broke a 33-year Liberal Democrat stranglehold 
on a seat in Nara. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Split This Time 
</P>
<P>
Victories by Rengo candidates, who were backed by four opposition parties, in 
all 10 of the one-seat districts in which they ran marked a major departure 
from past elections. Previously, Liberal Democrats in such constituencies could 
count upon the opposition splitting up its vote to ride to victory even with 
only a plurality of the ballots. Three years ago, the conservatives won 23 of 
the 26 one-seat districts but this time secured only three of them. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the unionists put up candidates who were not professional 
union leaders but rather lawyers, professors, journalists and women with no 
previous experience in politics. 
</P>
<P>
A repetition of that tactic in a lower house election could spell major trouble 
for the Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Like the established opposition parties, however, Rengo has failed to reach 
agreement on major policies that would be necessary to form an opposition-led 
coalition should the Liberal Democrats lose their majority in a lower house 
election.

Hundreds of shrimpers dismantled a coastline boat blockade but warned that it 
would resume Tuesday unless the federal government eases a law requiring them 
to use turtle excluder devices in their nets. Tee John Mialjevich of Gretna, 
La., founder of the 2,000-member Concerned Shrimpers of America and organizer 
of the blockades that began Saturday, asked the shrimpers on marine radios to 
move out of shipping channels while Gulf Coast lawmakers meet today with 
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher. Most shrimpers from Cameron, La., to 
Port Aransas, Tex., have complied with the request. But some shrimpers 
continued to block the Brownsville Ship Channel near Port Isabel at midday, the 
Coast Guard said.

JURORS CLEAR S.F. OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A grand jury in San Francisco has cleared four police officers of criminal 
wrongdoing in the removal of a file in the case of an officer accused of 
hitting farm labor leader Dolores Huerta. "We are of the opinion that there is 
not sufficient evidence to lodge criminal charges against anyone," the grand 
jury said in a statement to the San Francisco Police Commission. But the panel 
also voiced concerns about the way police handled their investigation in the 
Huerta case and said the removal of the memo undermined the public's "already 
shaky confidence" in the department. Police Chief Frank Jordan said he is 
satisfied with the grand jury's findings. The grand jury had been looking into 
allegations that Deputy Chief John Jordan, the chief's brother, and three other 
officers withheld evidence in the Huerta case. Huerta, a leader of the United 
Farm Workers, suffered broken ribs and a ruptured spleen when a police officer 
allegedly hit her with a night stick at a demonstration protesting the presence 
of then-Vice President George Bush at a fund-raiser. The grand jury, while 
saying no laws were broken, recommended punishment for officers who 
deliberately removed the memo. The Police Commission is the only agency that 
can decide whether to discipline the officers.

A U.S.-born rancher indicted in Costa Rica for arms and drug trafficking in 
connection with the Iran-Contra affair has vanished, officials said. A 
spokesman for the Public Security Ministry said Costa Rican authorities haven't 
seen John Hull since last Thursday. "I suspect that Mr. Hull has been 
kidnaped," said Juan Jose Sobrado, Hull's lawyer. Hull, 68, from Evansville, 
Ind., has lived in Costa Rica for the past 20 years and became a naturalized 
citizen seven years ago. Last week, a Costa Rican commission recommended that 
Hull be stripped of his citizenship and expelled from the country. According to 
the commission, planes smuggling arms to the Contras landed secretly at Hull's 
ranch in 1984 and 1985. Drug trafficking also was alleged.

FEDERAL CONVICTIONS JUMP DRAMATICALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 161.4% jump in drug convictions paced a 48.7% increase in defendants found 
guilty of federal crimes between 1980 and 1987, the Justice Department said. 
Results of a Bureau of Justice Statistics study showed that by 1987, a larger 
proportion of convicted defendants received prison terms from federal judges 
and their sentences were on average 11 months longer than those imposed in 
1980, the department said. The number of criminal defendants convicted in 
federal courts nationwide increased from 29,943 in 1980 to 44,518 in 1987, 
while the conviction rate for defendants prosecuted in federal courts increased 
from 76% in 1980 to 81% in 1987, the study said. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
said the figures demonstrated the need for more money to build additional 
prisons to house the increasing number of convicted defendants sent behind 
bars.

Britain is concerned about the whereabouts of the husband of Myanmar's 
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the Foreign Office said. Briton Michael 
Aris left London on Friday, but when he arrived in Myanmar, formerly Burma, he 
was not permitted to see a British diplomat waiting for him at the airport. A 
Foreign Office spokesman said it was possible that Aris, an Oxford University 
professor and an expert on Tibet, was under house arrest. The government has 
placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest and accused her of trying to "revive 
anarchy" in the country. She has been the most vocal critic of Gen. Saw Maung's 
military government, which seized power in a coup in September and imposed 
martial law.

Two former government officials announced that they will seek to qualify an 
initiative for the 1990 ballot that would limit to eight years the time anyone 
could serve in the Legislature. Jerry Partain, a former director of the state 
Department of Forestry, and John E. McDonald, a former assistant legislative 
counsel, said they are sponsoring the measure to remove career politicians from 
office and encourage the election of "citizen legislators." If successful, the 
measure sponsored by the two Republicans could substantially reduce the 
influence of the Democratic Party in the Legislature, because the Assembly and 
Senate are now controlled by Democrats.

 -- Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney briefly swapped the hardball world 
of politics for a softball diamond in Vancouver, British Columbia, and came up 
a winner there too. His Canadian team squeaked by their rivals from the United 
States, 13-12, in a celebrity game for charity, and Mulroney, at first base, 
was named player of the game. Security was heavy but the prime minister joked 
that there were no police around him because "they're not good enough to make 
this cut . . . this is the big league." Among those on the losing side were Los 
Angeles Kings hockey standout Wayne Gretzky, his wife, actress Janet Jones, and 
actors Gene Hackman and Richard Dean Anderson. Also in the game were former 
hockey star Gordie Howe and actresses Catherine Mary Stewart and JoBeth 
Williams. Wheelchair athlete Rick Hansen, playing for Canada, got the only 
standing ovation when the teams were announced. Musician-producer David Foster, 
who organized the game, said it raised as much as 250,000 Canadian dollars to 
help families of children who need organ transplants.

 -- More than 900 fans spent the weekend at the third annual Three Stooges 
convention in Trevose, Pa., competing in a Curly sound-alike contest, nyuking 
along with the trio's filmed comedies and bidding on Stooge memorabilia. 
Autographs of the original Three Stooges -- Moe Howard, Curly Howard and Larry 
Fine -- were available for $1,500. "Everybody's been a Stooge at one time in 
life and can relate to it," Phyllis Reighter said. She and her husband, Frank, 
organized the convention with the head of the national Stooges fan club, Gary 
Lassin. Phyllis Reighter said that Sally Starr, who appeared in the Stooge film 
"The Outlaws Is Coming," was at the conference.

At least 100,000 people in the United States now have AIDS. When the monthly 
total for July is compiled and released in late August, Centers for Disease 
Control experts are sure that America's count of total AIDS cases will, for the 
first time, officially pass 100,000. Many experts have admitted that the AIDS 
case total is a rough estimate, but what the official total does emphasize is 
that there has been no retreat or slowing in the statistical march of AIDS. By 
1992, the federal agency expects there will be a cumulative total of 365,000 
confirmed cases of AIDS. The agency also predicts that within three years the 
total number of U.S. residents killed by AIDS will reach 263,000.

FUTURE SHAKY FOR DIVIDED VAN NUYS AIRPORT PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN STEINBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the spring of 1985, Los Angeles City Council members came to a San Fernando 
Valley junior high school for a public hearing on Van Nuys Airport and were 
bowled over by the passion of the angry debate between noise protesters and 
aircraft owners. 
</P>
<P>
They had an idea. Why couldn't both sides sit down together, discuss their 
problems calmly, find mutual solutions and recommend them to the council? 
</P>
<P>
Thus was born the Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, the council faces an uncertain future, torn apart by the same 
polarization and intense feelings that led to its birth. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-noise activists, who say the council has been hopelessly divided from the 
start, want to dissolve it. They say the panel has been overrun by pro-airport 
members and no longer represents the concerns of homeowners who live with daily 
aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Walkout 
</P>
<P>
The longstanding rancor erupted at a meeting two weeks ago at which five of the 
10 members present stormed out of the room and threatened to resign. Two say 
they intend to remain, two are undecided and one plans to quit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a homeowner group has entered the fray, demanding that an entirely 
new group composed exclusively of residents be formed. Pilots and airport-based 
businesses have no place on a panel of residents, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"There already is an airport tenants council," said Gerald A. Silver, president 
of Homeowners of Encino, which represents 850 families, many of whom he said 
are affected by airport noise. 
</P>
<P>
"There already is a sounding board for them. For them to sit on a citizens 
panel is patently outlandish. It's like a board looking to clean up air 
pollution and water pollution and instead of putting scientists and community 
leaders on, they put on the polluters. It's like putting Exxon on a panel to 
deal with how shipping should go down the coast." 
</P>
<P>
Spearheading the revolt on the council is Don Schultz, one of the panel's 
original members, who is also president of Ban Airport Noise, long a foe of the 
Burbank and Van Nuys airports. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents got this council started," Schultz said. "It was supposed to be 
a citizens group and it has ceased being responsive to citizen interests." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Joel Wachs, who appointed Schultz to the advisory group and 
represents the district in which the city-owned airport is located, says he's 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"It was set up so the aviation community could work with residents," said 
Wachs' deputy, Renee Weitzer. "That's what it was set up for and that's what he 
wants to happen. Joel still feels it's a viable thing and that it should 
continue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Bias 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the airport council expressed similar sentiments. Lee K. 
Alpert, an attorney who lives in Northridge, has been pegged by resident 
council members as pro-aviation. But, like other members who say they are 
neutral, Alpert denies any bias and said he decides each issue case by case, 
trying to balance community and airport interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Noise is a significant problem that our group has to deal with," Alpert said. 
"But it is not the only problem." He said he wants the advisory board to remain 
intact, with a diversity of interests represented. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport is going to exist, and more and more residents are coming into the 
area," Alpert said. "We have to find a way to coexist." 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Airport was built as a small landing strip in 1928 when the Valley was 
still a vast, rural outpost of Los Angeles. That strip has gradually grown into 
the busiest general aviation airport in the nation -- and the seventh busiest 
in the world -- with 672,000 takeoffs and landings a year. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, farms surrounding the airfield have given way to housing 
tracts and mini-malls, and the chicken farmers who once complained about noise 
from propeller planes have been replaced by organized homeowner groups fighting 
the din of small business jets and charter craft. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tension between those using the airport and those who wish it 
would simply go away has steadily mounted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 Unanimous Decision 
</P>
<P>
In the four years since the council was created to offer advice on the airport, 
it has reached a unanimous decision on only one of nearly 100 items that have 
come before it, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
And instead of mending old wounds and hammering out solutions to their 
differences, as council members hoped, the citizens panel has become a forum 
for the rivalries of homeowners intent on limiting use of the airport, and 
pilots and airport-based businesses who want to see it grow. 
</P>
<P>
There have been victories on both sides: 
</P>
<P>
*In 1988, the advisory council voted unanimously to recommend that an aviation 
museum and park be built on part of the 62-acre corner of the airport that the 
Air National Guard plans to vacate by 1990. That recommendation has been 
included in all four plans under consideration for the site. 
</P>
<P>
*Early this year, a sharply divided council recommended approval of plans by 
Skytrails Aviation to expand onto two additional acres at the airport, adding 
parking tie-downs for 35 planes. Airport commissioners heeded that 
recommendation and approved Skytrails' request despite strong objections from 
anti-noise council members who complained that the expansion would lead to more 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
Resident members were also angered that the Los Angeles Board of Airport 
Commissioners approved the plan based on a decade-old environmental study, 
which found that the project would have minimal impact on surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
*In 1986, the council narrowly approved a recommendation to ban touch-and-go 
training operations on weekends and holidays. The issue is still under 
consideration by the airport commission. 
</P>
<P>
*In 1987, the council, again by a narrow majority, voted to ask for a study on 
banning takeoffs between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. -- an issue that will be covered by 
a comprehensive federal noise-control study now under way. Presently, there is 
a night takeoff ban on only the loudest planes, those classified by the Federal 
Aviation Administration as exceeding 74 decibels on takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
*And in October, 1987, and then again in June, the airport commissioners, with 
no prodding from the council, passed resolutions stating their intention to 
reduce the amount of land used for general aviation purposes from more than 219 
acres today to 166 acres by the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
That is not expected to immediately affect the number of flights at the 
airport, since much of the land involved will be vacated by tenants who do not 
generate many flights. In addition, other airport tenants can add to flight 
operations if there is room on their property. 
</P>
<P>
But council member Robert R. Jackson, a professional pilot and aerial 
photographer, views the resolution as a concession. 
</P>
<P>
"How dare they talk about not getting their way," Jackson said of the 
anti-noise faction. "This outfit is regressing, and these people talk about not 
getting their way. All I have to say is, 'Bah, humbug!' " 
</P>
<P>
For residents, however, the bottom line is noise. They say there's more of it 
all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Beard, a noise abatement officer for the city Department of Airports, 
agrees with them. Noise has increased in recent years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Density 
</P>
<P>
Noise control records indicate that the number of residences in the 
highest-noise zone increased from 61 in 1986 to 678 in 1988, he said, although 
new apartments built in the affected area account for much of the increase. 
Changes in the method of computing the data also are a factor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Short of banning all night operations or imposing noise limits, there is little 
chance of soothing the anti-noise faction's complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I really am very hopeless about the whole situation," council member Lisa 
Barrena said. "The noise is getting louder and louder. If we could sell the 
house and walk out tomorrow, that would be one thing. But my husband is 84 and 
I'm 72, and we've been here all these years." 
</P>
<P>
From 1980 to 1989, at a time when total aircraft at Van Nuys decreased from 
1,372 to 951, the number of jets increased from 18 to 93 and helicopters 
increased from 21 to 61, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
Airport spokesman Bob Hayes argues that many of the new planes are quieter 
because of technological advances. But residents who live under the flight path 
disagree, which is why they want a unanimous voice on development issues before 
the advisory council. That, in turn, would give them more clout before airport 
commissioners and the City Council, they say. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-flying faction sees no reason to give them more power, and no 
agreements are in sight. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters "think the council was put together to be an anti-noise 
council," said Clay Lacy, owner of a large charter aircraft firm and chairman 
of the council. "But that's not what the bylaws are all about."

FROM LA OPINION TO EL PATO DONALD, NEWSSTANDS CATER TO SPANISH-SPEAKING READERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Latino readers, there is a little bit of everything at Laurel Newsstand in 
Pacoima, where the affable owner, Lewis (Lucky Lew) Gross, greets his customers 
with broken Spanish and a heavy New York accent. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age girls browse through his Spanish-language collection of romantic 
comic-strip novels while immigrant workers ask him for Mexico City "scandal 
sheets" filled with graphic stories of murder and corruption. And Gross sells 
Low Rider magazine to the young Chicanos who cruise surrounding streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We specialize in Spanish because 95% of the people here are Spanish," said 
Gross, a 75-year-old former New York City policeman. "There's no Jews here but 
me. . . . If you find someone here who isn't Spanish, they're probably lost." 
</P>
<P>
The transplanted Easterner might not seem to fit the role, but his little 
newsstand on Van Nuys Boulevard is an important part of the cultural life of 
the East Valley. His business is one of a handful of Valley newsstands and 
bookstores where everything from Penthouse magazine to the Bible are available 
in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday, business at Gross' newsstand was slow, but steady. "I'm 
looking for Cosmopolitan in Spanish, but I can't find it," said Maria Holguin, 
an El Paso native who lives in Pacoima, as she scanned the racks of magazines. 
Eventually, she took a copy of a comic book, El Pato Donald (Donald Duck), for 
her 4-year-old daughter, Kristina. 
</P>
<P>
Gross boasts the largest collection of Spanish magazines and newspapers in the 
Valley. La Opinion is the biggest seller, with about 150 copies sold each day. 
He pointed with pride to 14 different English-Spanish dictionaries and 
self-taught courses in U.S. civics. "They use those to study for the amnesty," 
Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything is informative and educational, however. Gross also sells about 
20 different sexually oriented magazines, most in plastic wrappers, in both 
Spanish and English. The language doesn't really matter, Gross said, since no 
one really reads these magazines anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Also popular are the sensationalist Mexican magazines, such as Alarma!, which 
display the tortured bodies of crime victims in color photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Donato Jimenez, 55, said he likes these magazines because they are relaxing and 
a diversion from his job as a hospital janitor. He said he has found articles 
about a growing scandal surrounding the Mexico City police force especially 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
"They're real crooks," Jimenez said. "All those rats in Mexico who are 
policemen and who are robbing the people. . . . I'm glad they arrested them." 
</P>
<P>
For the Chicano youth of the East Valley, Gross sells not just Low Rider but 
also Teen Angels at $9.95. The Rialto-based magazine features, among other 
things, snapshots of tough-looking youths posing before graffiti-scarred walls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice magazine," Gross said, as he leafed through the glossy pages with 
elaborate drawings. 
</P>
<P>
No copies of Teen Angel or Alarma! can be found a few miles away in Arleta, 
where Roberto Lozano and his wife, Marta, operate another Spanish-language 
bookstore, the Libreria Cristiana Emmanuel on Nordhoff Street. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano is a member of the evangelical Servants of God Church in Van Nuys. He 
said he considers it part of his personal mission to fight precisely the kind 
of literature sold at Gross' and other newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
"Pornography and all those kinds of books where they talk about drugs and 
drinking, that doesn't help people," Lozano said. "We feel we have to speak out 
against that with books that help the family." 
</P>
<P>
Lozano said the bestseller at his Christian bookstore is the Bible. He sells 
about a dozen versions -- leather-bound and paperback, with extra-large type 
and one on a cassette for the bed-ridden or illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano, a 46-year-old worker at the General Motors plant in Van Nuys, said he 
opened the bookstore after years of traveling to downtown Los Angeles with his 
fellow church members to find religious literature in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been my dream for 15 years," Lozano said. "I have a secular job, but 
my heart ishere. I come whenever I can." 
</P>
<P>
Most Spanish-language bookstores in the Valley supplement their sales by 
carrying other merchandise. Although it is called a bookstore, for example, the 
Libreria Mexico in San Fernando actually carries more records, tapes and 
cosmetics than books and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Still, reading material makes up an important part of the store's sales, said 
owner Arturo de la Parra, who founded the bookstore 20 years ago with his wife, 
Maria. The daily newspapers La Prensa Grafica of El Salvador and Excelsior of 
Mexico both sell briskly as do the store's small collection of dime novels. 
</P>
<P>
One teen-age girl blushed when a visitor asked her about the small book she had 
just purchased. It was titled Deseo (Desire), the story of young woman's 
romantic adventures as a photojournalist on a Greek island. 
</P>
<P>
"I buy one every week. They're exciting," she said in Spanish. "You never know 
what will happen next."

STATE AGENCY HAD TO RESTRICT LANDFILL, OBSERVERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state's decision to crack down on Lopez Canyon Landfill was far from the 
blanket endorsement of the status quo anticipated by the dump's operator and 
many of its angry northeast San Fernando Valley neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But state legislators, lobbyists and other observers of the California Waste 
Management Board say the board's July 7 order -- to immediately reduce the 
landfill's height, size and the number of trucks dumping there daily -- was the 
predictable response of a state agency under siege. 
</P>
<P>
"They did the only thing they could do, because everybody is watching," said Hy 
Weitzman, executive vice president of the California Refuse Removal Council, a 
lobbying organization for trash haulers and handlers. 
</P>
<P>
The board's action surprised the city of Los Angeles, which runs the landfill 
and dumps two-thirds of the city's residential trash there. Yet perhaps no one 
was more stunned than Rob Zapple, a Kagel Canyon resident who has been one of 
the dump's most outspoken opponents. In the past, Zapple claimed, the board had 
ignored his complaints. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Really Confusing' 
</P>
<P>
"It's great news but it's really confusing for us,' Zapple said after learning 
of the state action. "It's all the things we've been saying for so long -- 
they're finally giving some credence to them." 
</P>
<P>
Political scrutiny of the board has increased during the past year, ignited, 
some say, by the realization that California is running out of places to put 
its trash. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the outcome of that scrutiny has been a Little Hoover Commission report 
harshly critical of the board's alleged lack of leadership in recycling and the 
drafting of legislation that calls for an overhaul of the board. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics hope to turn the current wave of disapproval into a death knell 
for the board. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying right now to pull the plug on them, basically," said Rod Miller, 
legislative director for Californians Against Waste. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental lobbyists such as Miller have long maintained that the board has 
been too cozy with waste haulers and dump operators while overlooking the fears 
and problems of the public. They point to a past board chairman who left after 
questions arose about whether his financial ties to industry had influenced his 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pending Bills 
</P>
<P>
Pending bills by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) and state Sen. Marion 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) seek to limit the number of board members who may 
have direct links to the waste industry. At present, at least two members must 
come from the industry, but there is no upper limit. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the allegations against past board members remain unsubstantiated, 
according to the Little Hoover Commission report released earlier this month. 
But the report states that regardless of the validity of those allegations, 
"the potential of a conflict and common perception that there is a conflict" 
have eroded public faith in the board. 
</P>
<P>
Board spokesman Chris Peck denied that the board has favored industry in its 
past votes, and he disputed claims that the board now has turned against dump 
operators because of the criticism. 
</P>

<P>
But as assaults on the board's track record grew, its staff began a review of 
permits for the more than 300 landfills in the state. Peck said many of the 
permits, including Lopez Canyon's, were several years out of date. Under state 
law, permits are supposed to be reviewed and updated every five years. Lopez 
Canyon was operating with a 1978 permit. 
</P>
<P>
Attention soon focused on Lopez Canyon, Peck said, partly because of "the 
vociferous nature of local residents and their elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
All year, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and Assemblywoman Marian W. La 
Follette (R-Northridge) have corresponded regularly with the state board about 
perceived problems at the dump, as did Zapple and other du p ne ghbors. 
</P>
<P>
Onto this political battlefield wandered Los Angeles city officials. 
</P>
<P>
So confident were they of smooth sailing through a revision of the dump's 1978 
permit that the only change they asked for was an increase in the volume of 
trash allowed -- from 8,000 tons a month, which apparently was a typographical 
error and never reflected reality, to the current load of 4,000 tons a day. 
</P>
<P>
They did not bother to mention other fundamental changes in landfill operations 
since the permit was issued 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Belief 
</P>
<P>
That, said Deputy City Atty. Christopher M. Westhoff, is because for years the 
city believed that a description of landfill operations submitted to the state 
in a 1983 engineering report, which more closely reflects today's operations, 
had become part of the permit. He said the board staff contributed to that 
belief. 
</P>
<P>
"As late as May, we have documents from their staff that they intended to roll 
the 1983 limits into the permit," Westhoff said. "Then there was an about-face. 
They just changed the rules on us." 
</P>
<P>
Peck acknowledges that the board was "not as diligent as it should have been" 
at reviewing permits over the years. But he said that three years ago staff 
members began questioning Los Angeles about its reliance on the 1983 limits. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say their first indication that board attitudes may have changed 
was the July 7 order, contained in a letter to the agency that polices Lopez 
Canyon for the state: the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
The letter asked the county to force the city to scale back operations at the 
dump to levels approved in its 1978 permit: 400 trucks a day instead of up to 
600, a maximum elevation of 1,725 feet instead of 1,760 and dump boundaries 
within a 140-acre area of the 392-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cause Closing 
</P>
<P>
The city claims those limits would cause the dump to close within a year and is 
fighting the order in Los Angeles Superior Court. The next hearing on the case 
is set for Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
But Peck said the board's concern about Lopez Canyon was heightened even 
earlier -- in March -- when two landfill workers fainted after unearthing toxic 
gas. Dump opponents, too, believe that may have been the turning point in their 
years-long struggle to get state officials to acknowledge problems at the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
"My God, we had people injured. There was no way it could be ignored," said 
Lewis Snow, vice president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn. "It was 
very advantageous for us. . . . If that had not happened, perhaps we would not 
be at the point we are today." 
</P>
<P>
Even after the new state order arrived, however, city officials held out hope 
that they would be able to persuade the board to be more lenient during its 
July meeting in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restrictions Reiterated 
</P>
<P>
Instead, at the meeting July 14, they received a reiteration of the letter's 
restrictions and a reduction of their 4,000-ton request to 3,100 tons. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got to the meeting it was cut-and-dried," said Edward Avila, president 
of the city Board of Public Works. "The feeling was it was a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
That rebuff fresh in their memories, Los Angeles city officials now fear that 
they may face a similar reaction to their plans for doubling the size of Lopez 
Canyon and extending its life span beyond 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Peck said review of that proposal will not be prejudiced by the current 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
But Delwin A. Biagi, director of the city Bureau of Sanitation, told the City 
Council last week, "I do not consider the waste management board has much 
sympathy for the city of Los Angeles' problems right now."

LOPEZ CLOSURE WOULD STRAIN OTHER DUMPS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The gate at the Puente Hills landfill, just off the Pomona Freeway, opens 
shortly before 6 every morning to admit a seemingly endless parade of trash 
trucks, dump trucks, long-beds, tractor-trailers and pickups, all laden with 
refuse. 
</P>
<P>
It is a noisy procession of ugly, utilitarian vehicles, enlivened by an oddity 
here and there. One big refuse truck carries the slogan: "Drugs are Garbage." A 
tree-service truck sputters forward so overloaded with branches and greenery 
that it seems to be lurching toward a mechanical breakdown. A pickup truck, 
dwarfed by the huge trucks alongside, moves forward with a light load: a broken 
stool, old garden hoses and a batch of odds and ends that probably sat for 
years in someone's garage. 
</P>
<P>
The air carries an odor that, while not overwhelming, remains a constant 
reminder that this is the largest dump in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Puente Hills is also, Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts officials say, 
the second busiest landfill in the nation, handling about 13,200 tons a day and 
trailing only a dump on Staten Island, N.Y., in trash volume. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of four large landfills in the San Gabriel Valley, any or all of 
which may soon become even busier if the city of Los Angeles is forced to close 
its landfill at Lopez Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the state Waste Management Board are disputing how much trash can 
be deposited at that landfill, which handles about 4,000 tons a day. City 
officials say they could be forced to shut down the landfill within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the addition of Lopez Canyon trash, dumps in the San Gabriel 
Valley handle 26,000 tons of refuse every day, more than half of the trash 
dumped in Los Angeles County. Landfills presently reduce their hours to stay 
within their daily disposal limits. And as dumps continue to fill and close 
early, trucks must travel farther, meaning more air pollution and higher trash 
collection rates. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Maguin, who oversees Puente Hills and other landfills run by the county 
Sanitation Districts, said trash haulers are using more trucks and sending them 
farther because of the shortage of landfill space. Maguin said early daily 
closure of the Puente Hills landfill is becoming "more and more routine." 
</P>
<P>
When Puente Hills is closed, most trash trucks head for the Sanitation 
Districts' Spadra landfill in Pomona or the privately owned BKK landfill in 
West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Growth 
</P>
<P>
Maguin said the Spadra landfill, which is permitted to receive 18,000 tons of 
trash a week, is beginning to fill up early too, partly because of the overflow 
from Puente Hills and partly because of growth in the east San Gabriel Valley 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The primary beneficiary of the landfill shortage has been the West Covina 
landfill owned by the BKK Corp. Six years ago, when its landfill was the only 
hazardous waste dump in Southern California, BKK Corp. grossed $23 million a 
year taking in waste that no one else could handle. 
</P>
<P>
But the revenue dropped abruptly in 1984, when pressure from the public and 
state and federal regulators forced BKK to close its landfill to hazardous 
waste. Reduced to competing with other dumps for household trash, BKK Corp. saw 
its landfill revenue plummet to under $7 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
But with landfill space for household trash becoming increasingly scarce, the 
BKK landfill is a huge revenue producer again. The city of West Covina, which 
levies a 10% tax on landfill revenue, estimates that the BKK landfill will 
gross $25 million to $30 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2nd in Volume 
</P>
<P>
BKK corporate counsel Ronald Gastelum said the landfill receives 9,500 to 
10,000 tons of trash a day, ranking it just behind Puente Hills in trash volume 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
The Sanitation Districts also run the Scholl Canyon landfill, which is owned by 
the city of Glendale and accepts trash only from Glendale, Pasadena, South 
Pasadena, La Canada Flintridge, San Marino and Sierra Madre. It takes about 
2,500 tons of trash a day. 
</P>
<P>
Maguin said the Sanitation Districts have prohibited Los Angeles from dumping 
trash at the Puente Hills and Spadra landfills, and Scholl Canyon cannot take 
Los Angeles trash. Officials at the privately owned Azusa Land Reclamation Co. 
said they don't have room to take any trash from Los Angeles. That landfill is 
operating at capacity -- 1,500 tons a day. 
</P>
<P>
The BKK landfill takes some trash from Los Angeles. Gastelum said BKK could not 
handle all of the Los Angeles trash that goes to Lopez Canyon but would "be 
willing to help out on a temporary basis," taking some for six months or so 
while the city searches for alternatives. In return, he said, BKK Corp. would 
like a chance to participate in a recycling program that the city is 
developing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Worries 
</P>
<P>
West Covina City Manager Herman R. (Bob) Fast said more trash from Los Angeles 
might create traffic problems near the BKK dump. If it does, he said, the city 
would ask BKK Corp. to regulate the hours of disposal to ease congestion. He 
said West Covina has been advised by its attorney that it has no legal right to 
restrict the source of the trash BKK takes. 
</P>
<P>
Fast said that if BKK increases its trash volume, one benefit to landfill 
opponents might be to advance the dump's closure date by a few months by 
filling the disposal area early. BKK Corp. has an agreement with the city to 
close its West Covina landfill in 1995 or earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The company is attempting to establish a new dump at Elsmere Canyon near 
Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
The Elsmere Canyon landfill is one of a number of proposals to provide new dump 
capacity in Los Angeles County. There are also proposals to haul trash by rail 
to remote disposal sites outside the county. 
</P>
<P>
But, Maguin said, none of the alternatives is likely to occur soon, and the 
landfill shortage may worsen. 
</P>
<P>
"If Lopez Canyon were to close, that really forces the issue," he said.

TURNBULL LEAVES NO DOUBT IN RECORD RUN; 
</P>
<P>
HE SHATTERS MARK IN 800 METERS AT MASTERS EVENT

When Derek Turnbull completed his 60-64 age-group heat of the 800 meters in 
2:14.90 Thursday, he shattered the world record of 2:17 set by Australian John 
Gilmour in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
A world record? Well, yes and no. Turnbull knew there was still a small matter 
to be cleared up. During the 1985 World Games in Rome, fellow New Zealander 
Frank Evans ran a 2:14.02, but it was never officially recorded because the 
Italian organizers never filed the required paper work. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday during the TAC/USA Masters National Championships at San Diego State, 
Turnbull easily outran Evans to take first place in the 800 finals with a time 
of 2:12.62, which effectively erases any preceding error in the record books. 
</P>
<P>
"Derek's my arch-enemy on the track," Evans said. "And he took all doubt (about 
who's the fastest 60-64-year-old 800 runner) away today." 
</P>
<P>
It should be pointed out that when Evans turned in his 2:14.02 he was just 60 
years old. Turnbull is 62. In other words, Turnbull is two years past the prime 
record-setting age. What has made a difference for him at this meet (he has 
also won the 5,000 meters and set a world record in the 1,500 meters) has been 
preparation and increased competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I could do it in my condition," Turnbull said of the records. "I'm 
starting to get faster all the time because of better competition." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Turnbull preceded the meet with six weeks of running marathons up 
and down the West Coast also aided his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave himself six weeks and this is the result," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
There were two other record-setting 800-meter runs. In the women's 65-69 group, 
Mary Story's finish in 3:08.21 was good for a world mark, and in the women's 
40-44 group, Sue Holton set an American record at 2:21.91. 
</P>
<P>
One other 800 meters of note was the men's 40-44 race won by Nolan Smith in 
1:58.25. Smith, who had not competed since he was 35, came from last place 
among nine runners in the final 120 yards to edge Richard Tucker (1:58.44) and 
Ronald Jensen (1:58.47). He did all this while fighting back asthma-related 
breathing problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew if I had a chance to start slow, I could win it," said Smith, a trumpet 
player who has toured with Stevie Wonder, Dianna Ross and Count Basie. "And 
luckily the first lap was slow. . . . I felt like a longshot until after the 
first lap when I saw we finished in 59 seconds. Then I knew I had it made." 
</P>
<P>
The featured events of the fourth and final day of the meet were the age-graded 
100-meter dashes. All winners of the age-group 100-meter races ran against one 
another and were given "handicaps" in meters depending on their age. 
</P>
<P>
The women's winner was Irene Obera, 55, of Palo Alto. She completed her 78.7 
meters in 10.91, beating Great Britain's Una Gore (who ran 80.7 meters in 
11.14). 
</P>
<P>
The men's winner was Bill Collins, 38. Collins had to make up a 6.3-meter 
stagger-start on second-place finisher, Ken Dennis, 52; and an 18.4-meter 
stagger on third-place finisher Payton Jordan, 72. 
</P>
<P>
Collins clocked a 10.30 95.2 meters to barely defeat Dennis (10.37, 88.9 
meters) and Jordan (10.41, 76.8 meters) in a photo finish.

'PRECIOUS GIFT' OF ACTRESS TOLD AT FUNERAL RITE

"I do it for me 
</P>
<P>
I have the right to say no 
</P>
<P>
I live for now 
</P>
<P>
Life is not a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rebecca Schaeffer 
</P>
<P>
Untitled Poem, July, 1989 
</P>
<P>
Slain actress Rebecca Schaeffer was eulogized here Sunday as "a precious gift 
-- a gift that was snatched back, but one that will give us extraordinary 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Joshua Stampfer told the 200 mourners at Ahavai Sholom Cemetery's small 
chapel that Schaeffer "brought in her short life more joy to more people than 
most of us achieve in a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Time after time, Schaeffer's mother, Danna, placed her hand atop the simple 
wooden casket with white lilies and roses on top. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer's best friend, Barbara Lusch, and the actress' boyfriend, Bradley 
Silberling, had stayed up the night before, typing Schaeffer's poems and 
binding them with pastel ribbons -- making a personal memorial for each 
mourner. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer, 21, was killed last Tuesday when she opened the door to her West 
Hollywood apartment building to find a man with a handgun waiting for her. 
</P>
<P>
Police allege that Robert Bardo, 19, of Tucson, who investigators describe as 
an "obsessed fan," fired a single bullet into her chest. He is being held on 
$1-million bail in the Arizona city. 
</P>
<P>
Friends from Eugene and Portland, along with Pam Dawber, Schaeffer's co-star 
from the television series "My Sister Sam," and her husband, actor Mark Harmon, 
also mourned the actress Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I met the most sparkling soul who I wanted to spend my life with," Silberling, 
of Los Angeles, said, unable to hold back his tears. "And her name is Rebecca." 
</P>
<P>
His sentiments triggered an outburst of emotion from the mourners. 
</P>
<P>
"She always said I love to be held so close," Silberling continued. "So please 
hold her close in your hearts because . . ." His voice trailed off. 
</P>
<P>
"It is truth that we are shocked by the senselessness and meaninglessness of 
what happened," Rabbi Emanuel Rose, of Portland's Temple Beth Israel, said of 
Schaeffer's murder. 
</P>
<P>
Questioning the ready availability of handguns in this country, Rose said: "We 
are angered -- angry at a stranger, angry at a nation and revolving political 
leaders who refuse to eliminate the source of agony among so many Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the actress had helped her father, Dr. Benson Schaeffer, a 
child psychologist, teach a class at the temple for developmentally disabled 
youngsters, Rose said: "Rebecca was special. She achieved. She had perspective. 
She had perceptions and successes at an age where most others are barely 
beginning to know who they are." 
</P>
<P>
All that Rebecca Schaeffer was and accomplished was reason for "gratitude to 
God for her life," the rabbi said. "These qualities must become the balance for 
the days ahead. For without that sense of gratitude, we are doomed to despair." 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, conducted in English and Hebrew, Schaeffer's relatives 
stood at the grave site with their hands on the casket before it was slowly 
lowered into the earth. Then, her parents and other relatives took turns 
throwing a ceremonial shovelful of dirt into the grave. 
</P>
<P>
Other mourners plucked flowers from bouquets near the grave and dropped them on 
the casket. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh Rebecca," her grieving father said of his only child. "We're always 
thinking of you. We will always think of you."

FEAR HAUNTS CHURCH WHERE INTRUDING GUNMAN KILLED 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ and TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monique Woods, 13, and her brother, James, 11, so dreaded their return to 
church Sunday that they spent the entire night curled up in their grandmother's 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
They shuddered at the memory of the masked gunman who burst into Mt. Olive 
Church of God in Christ on Friday, just minutes after they had received their 
diplomas for attending a weeklong Bible class. 
</P>
<P>
They had nightmares after witnessing the deafening shots from a sawed-off 
shotgun, the bloodstains on the floor from the two people who lay dead, and the 
cries from the other children, "Mommy, mommy," as they huddled under the pews 
of the Southeast Los Angeles church. 
</P>
<P>
But their grandmother, Hannah Woods, wasn't about to let them stay home. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a church, you can't back off it," she said. "You just can't let the 
church die. If you give up, it means you've been defeated by the devil." 
</P>
<P>
So Monique put on a frilly white dress with matching bow, her brother dressed 
up in a crisp pink shirt with a white tie and they took their places with 75 
other people in the half-empty red velour pews of Mt. Olive. 
</P>
<P>
A gospel choir clad in white robes sang praises, a small combo laid down a 
rollicking boogie-woogie beat that made even some of the usually stoic 
white-gloved ushers tap their toes and the congregants cooled themselves with 
cardboard fans, supplied by a funeral home, that had printed on them: "In time 
of need, we are there." 
</P>
<P>
They prayed for Mae Lee, 76, a mother of six who had been shot in the back and 
killed as she ran in right toward the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
They prayed for Patronella Luke, a 35-year-old soprano who had been invited to 
sing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, killed by a shotgun blast to her temple. 
</P>
<P>
And they prayed for Luke's husband, Peter, 33, a computer technician who was 
wounded in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it would make us feel better, but I don't know," Monique said. "It's 
so scary. You don't know if that man might come back in." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police, who have kept guard in front of the church since the 
shooting, said Sunday that they still know of no motives and have made no 
arrests in connection with the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives are pursuing various theories, Sgt. Bob Riebold said, from the 
possibility of a gang-related attack to the chance that the Lukes -- who were 
sitting at opposite ends of the chapel -- may have been targeted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Man Sought 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the gunman, police are seeking a second armed man who waited 
outside the church. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) told the congregation that she is 
donating $5,000 in conjunction with the Black Women's Forum to be used as a 
reward for information leading to the capture of the assailant. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel, along with the rest of the community, violated," Waters said. "The 
church is a sanctuary that must never be violated." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. J.C. Brewster, pastor of Mt. Olive for 20 years, speculated that fear 
had probably kept away at least half of the 200 congregants who regularly 
attend Sunday services. He urged those who were there not to despair, but to 
continue as "pilgrims" on a righteous path. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep on keeping on," he said. "You can't stop now. You can't quit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Prophecy 
</P>
<P>
Brewster discounted the notion that he had somehow prophesied the attack on the 
Lukes Friday night when he told the couple that God was going to call on one of 
them. He said he was merely trying to inspire Peter Luke, a Sunday school 
teacher at the church, to continue living a devout life. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fine young man, very helpful," Brewster said, adding that he often 
singles out individuals in the congregation. "He was just young and needed 
encouragement . . . to be faithful." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Luke, who was in stable condition Sunday recovering from the leg wound at 
California Medical Center in Los Angeles, described the gunman's actions as 
"cold, calculating," but said he does not think he or his wife were 
specifically targeted. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him walk through the center aisle," Luke said. "He passed me . . . then 
shot in front . . . then I saw him point the gun at me and shoot. I hit the 
floor. After that, there was just screaming."

An experimental drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease must undergo 
further study before its usefulness can be determined, a researcher testing the 
drug said last week. Interim data from a study of the drug THA on 100 patients 
found that there are "substantial" health risks associated with the drug and 
that review of the study did not find statistical evidence of the drug's 
benefit, Mt. Sinai Medical Center researcher Kenneth Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
THA has received wide attention because there is no proven treatment for 
Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative brain disorder affecting more than 2 
million Americans. Two years ago, Warner-Lambert Co. began a study of the drug 
after Arcadia psychiatrist William Summers reported improved memory and 
functioning in his Alzheimer's patients taking the drug. 
</P>
<P>
However, Davis said that as many as 30% of patients in the Warner-Lambert study 
showed an increase in liver enzymes suggesting liver toxicity and that 15% had 
to be taken off the drug for this reason. Davis said THA's liver toxicity would 
be acceptable if the drug showed a measurable benefit to patients, but that 
more patients must be studied before such a determination can be made.

Scientists are working on a safe-to-eat, nearly invisible coating made from 
milk that could dramatically extend the shelf life of fruit and vegetables, the 
California Agriculture Department announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
Chemist Attila E. Pavlath of the department said that in tests of an 
experimental coating made from the milk protein casein, small pieces of sliced 
and peeled apple dipped in the coating stayed fresh for several days while 
unprotected pieces shriveled and turned brown within a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Pavlath said that scientists hope to eventually make the film thinner and to 
produce films that "the tongue cannot feel and the taste buds cannot detect" 
from proteins in soybeans, corn and wheat. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people who like fresh produce don't necessarily want to spend time in 
their kitchen washing, slicing, peeling, pitting and paring," Pavlath said. 
"It's part of the trend toward buying food that is ready to use and easy to 
store." 
</P>
<P>
A successful coating would allow more types of produce to be pre-sliced and 
packaged and, unlike waxes on cucumbers or other edible coatings such as the 
"skin" on sausages, new films could be modified to add flavors or colors to 
standard fare, Pavlath said.

Shrimpers blocking shipping lanes off Texas and Louisiana yielded to traffic 
after the Coast Guard agreed to hear their complaints about regulations 
intended to protect an endangered species of sea turtle. "If something is not 
done, there'll probably be violence," said Marvin Hickman, a shrimper from 
Tarpon Springs, Fla. At issue is a Commerce Department rule requiring use of 
what the shrimpers say is a cumbersome and costly device to allow sea turtles 
to escape the nets. About 200 shrimp boats had crowded the deep-water channel 
at Galveston, Tex. About 300 others jammed access to the Port of Corpus 
Christi, and smaller ports in both states were blocked.

The breakaway state of Northern Cyprus has jailed 91 Greek Cypriots for their 
part in a protest that has soured Greco-Turkish ties before talks on reunifying 
the Mediterranean island. The protesters, most of them women, were seized last 
week after breaking through the U.N. buffer zone lines in a "walk home" action 
last week to mark the 15th anniversary of Turkey's invasion of Cyprus. Of the 
108 arrested, 91 were fined and sentenced to three days in jail by the Nicosia 
district court. Sixteen women were freed on bail and one girl, aged 14, was 
freed unconditionally. Ten refused to comply with bail and were also jailed. 
About 100 Greek-Cypriots broke into the U.N. buffer zone west of Nicosia during 
another "walk home" over the weekend but were stopped before reaching Turkish 
lines.

FREED CHINESE DISSIDENTS TELL OF BRUTALITY IN PRISON

Chinese caught in waves of arrests after the army's suppression of the 
pro-democracy movement are emerging from prisons with descriptions of 
overcrowded prison cells, beatings and brutal interrogations, foreign diplomats 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
At least 5,000 people have been arrested in Beijing alone, the diplomats added, 
quoting informed Chinese sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital has been under martial law since May 20. Arrests are often 
made at night by plainclothes police in unmarked cars. Suspects disappear 
without their families being informed. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know where you are taken. You don't know where you are," said one 
former prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions vary. One well-known intellectual, who was detained for several 
days, said he was treated humanely and had no complaints, according to the 
diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unbearably Hot Cells 
</P>
<P>
Several others described small, unbearably hot cells packed so tightly with 40 
to 60 people that there was no room to lie down. The toilet was a bucket. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody who has been in prison and later released wants to be identified in 
reports by journalists. Most do not want to talk at all, the diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
Interrogations are sometimes preceded by a beating, according to two accounts. 
A student was hit by electric prods, a writer by rifle butts. 
</P>
<P>
Martial law troops and police alike use violence -- the worst beatings 
apparently administered to workers and unemployed youths who fought the army 
with Molotov cocktails and rocks when armored troops crashed through Beijing to 
Tian An Men Square on the weekend of June 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that many Chinese arrested have been released and then some detained 
for a second or third time, the diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, the new head of China's Communist Party put his stamp of 
leadership on the governing party with the release Sunday of an essay on 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin took a hard line on fighting corruption and enforcing obedience to 
central leadership -- both issues that senior party leaders have accused his 
predecessor, Zhao Ziyang, of neglecting. Zhao was ousted as party leader last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang's essay was printed in full in the magazine Party Building and summarized 
in leading newspapers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We must sternly observe unified party discipline, namely: The individual obeys 
the group, the minority obeys the majority, the lower levels obey the upper 
levels, the whole party obeys the center," Jiang said. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow the unchecked spread of individualism, separatism and money 
worship." 
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily said the essay was written in May. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second essay by Jiang to be widely disseminated in recent weeks. In 
the first Jiang wrote about the "dangers" of allowing businessmen to get too 
rich from private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
In the essay published Sunday, Jiang said: "Today many people's thinking is 
lively, and they dare to express various views, which of course is a good 
thing. But we party members must ponder deeply new ideological trends and 
public opinion and keep clear heads."

100 JEWISH YOUTHS HOLD PROTEST AT AUSCHWITZ CATHOLIC CONVENT

More than 100 Jewish students from Western Europe demonstrated Sunday outside a 
Roman Catholic convent at the edge of the Auschwitz Nazi concentration camp as 
several hundred Poles -- some making hostile comments -- watched. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second weekend of protests at the Carmelite convent, but there was 
no repeat of the July 14 incident in which an American rabbi and six students 
were roughed up and dragged away by convent construction workers after 
occupying the grounds for five hours. 
</P>
<P>
The convent was founded in 1984 in a former Nazi warehouse a few feet from the 
barbed wire fence and guard towers of the death camp, where an estimated 4 
million people -- including 2.5 million Jews -- were put to death during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
The cloister's lawn, with a 23-foot wooden cross in the middle, is a former 
gravel pit where prisoners were gunned down by Nazi executioners in 1940 and 
1941. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing against the Carmelites, but we are against them praying at 
this place," said Borem Laurent, a Brussels resident and chairman of the Union 
of Jewish students of Belgium. The group also included students from Holland, 
Switzerland and England. 
</P>
<P>
The 107 demonstrators, organized by the European Union of Jewish Students, sat 
for 20 minutes about 15 feet outside the convent gate. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred residents from Osweicim, the Polish name for Auschwitz, 
including couples with children, stood nearby, saying they came to "defend" the 
convent. 
</P>
<P>
A statement read Sunday by the student group's leader said that Polish-born 
Pope John Paul II was responsible for the convent's presence despite agreement 
that it would be removed by February.

JAPAN'S WOMEN VOTERS: A PINK REVOLT 
</P>

Yellow was the color of Corazon Aquino's "people power" revolution in the 
Philippines three years ago. If there was a theme color in Sunday's crushing 
electoral defeat for Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, it would have to 
be pink. 
</P>
<P>
Pink because the country's demure, soft-spoken women emerged from political 
obscurity to dominate campaign rhetoric with outrage over a new consumption tax 
they claimed betrayed ruling party promises and gouged their pocketbooks. An 
unprecedented number of women candidates vied for seats in the upper house of 
Parliament -- and an unprecedented number were elected in a wave of protest 
voting against the conservative, male leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Women supporting Takako Doi, the charismatic chairwoman of the Japan Socialist 
Party, attested to their loyalty with pink neckerchiefs. NHK, the 
semi-government television network, illustrated dramatic gains by the 
Socialists and other opposition parties early today with a chart showing pink 
pillars rising out of a stylized map of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Looming large in the mind of the irate electorate was the "pink scandal" of 
Prime Minister Sosuke Uno, who has been disgraced by recent accusations that he 
paid for sex in extramarital relations with a geisha and several other women. 
Uno has refused to comment on the allegations but conceded in a news conference 
this morning that he was resigning "to assume all responsibility" for matters 
contributing to the ruling party's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Erosion of public confidence in Uno and his Liberal Democrats began with 
revulsion against the tax reform, then worsened with disgust over disclosures 
of widespread political corruption in the Recruit Co. influence-buying scandal 
and contempt among farmers for a policy of liberalizing agricultural imports. 
</P>
<P>
But repudiation of the ruling party, which controlled Parliament for 34 years 
before losing its majority in the upper house Sunday, was galvanized by the 
moral pique of women. 
</P>
<P>
"Women felt they had to stand up, speak up and do something, otherwise nothing 
would change," said Doi, the Socialist Party leader, who credited female 
candidates and voters with shaping the direction of the polling. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a record 143 women entered the race as candidates, and early returns 
indicated that at least 20 had been elected among the 126 seats being 
contested. Such a strong representation has not been seen since 39 women were 
elected to the lower house of Parliament in 1946, soon after Japanese women 
were first granted the right to vote. And since only half the seats were 
contested in the upper house Sunday, it was proportionately the best showing 
for women in national politics ever -- at least a 15% share of the spoils. 
</P>
<P>
In getting out the vote, as well, women set the pace Sunday, out-voting their 
male counterparts by more than a percentage point with a turnout of 65.63%. 
Registered women voters outnumber men by 2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although women's groups had vociferously protested Uno's alleged extramarital 
indiscretions, the focus of female wrath in the election was the more pragmatic 
matter of livelihood. Specifically, they rallied against the 3% consumption 
tax, introduced unilaterally by the ruling conservatives earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this election illustrates anger over the consumption tax . . . 
especially among women and the elderly," said Yaeko Itohisa, a Socialist who 
won a seat in Chiba Prefecture (state). She vowed in a televised interview to 
fight for abolition of the tax, as did nearly all the opposition winners.

Investigators continued to use infrared cameras Sunday to search cornfields for 
pieces of a shattered jet engine from a DC-10 that crashed, and prayers for the 
110 people killed were offered during church services. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Lopatkiewicz, spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, said 
that most of the wreckage from the Wednesday crash had been recovered but that 
reconnaissance planes pressed the search for most of the fan section of the 
jet's tail engine, which apparently exploded and severed hydraulic lines. 
</P>
<P>
Lopatkiewicz said Nebraska Air National Guard jets were used to carry infrared 
cameras to photograph a 16-square-mile area about 60 miles from the crash site 
in a search for metal fragments thrown from the engine when it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Church services around Sioux City on Sunday morning centered on the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Hear our prayers this day again and again and again for the families, for the 
survivors," said the Rev. Duane Churchman, senior pastor at First United 
Methodist Church. About 300 people attended the service, more than a typical 
Sunday service draws there, a church official said. 
</P>
<P>
At the site of the crash of United Airlines Flight 232, officials were 
painstakingly reassembling the jet's tail section. 
</P>
<P>
Others gathered luggage and other personal effects, storing them in a hangar 
for families to retrieve. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said 39 people remained hospitalized early Sunday, but some 
were being dismissed as the day progressed. The plane was carrying 296 people. 
</P>
<P>
Medical examiners were working to identify the 110 victims of the crash. They 
have made positive identification on 100 bodies, a United spokesman said 
Sunday.

INGLEWOOD POLICE SHOOT MAN AFTER THREE-MILE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood police shot and wounded a man when he allegedly tried to run down an 
officer at the end of a three-mile chase, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Cephus Earl Sudduth Jr., 19, of Los Angeles, was pursued 
Saturday evening by police who said his green Cadillac matched the description 
of a car involved in a hit-and-run accident that left one person with minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cornered Near Race Track 
</P>
<P>
Police finally cornered Sudduth near Hollywood Park race track, but instead of 
surrendering, he accelerated toward the officers, authorities said. Several 
officers fired at him, striking him in his right side. Sudduth lost control of 
the car and slammed into a brick wall. 
</P>
<P>
He was in satisfactory condition at County-USC Medical Center jail ward, where 
he was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer, 
evading arrest, reckless driving and felony hit-and-run driving. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second shooting in two nights involving Inglewood police. Late 
Friday, police shot and killed a paroled burglar, Christopher Grant, 34, during 
a pursuit in which his car reportedly dragged an officer for 25 feet.

SANE TELETHON RAISES A RECORD $450,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second annual SANE Kids Say No to Drugs telethon raised a record $450,000 
in pledges to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department anti-drug program for 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood celebrities and sheriff's deputies took telephone pledges over the 
weekend under the wing of the Spruce Goose airplane in Long Beach. Performers 
such as Danny Glover, Red Buttons and Buddy Hackett participated in the 
telethon. 
</P>
<P>
The SANE (Substance Abuse Narcotics Education) program is currently taught in 
315 public and private schools in the county and concentrates on the fourth, 
fifth, and sixth grades, Deputy Bill Wehner said. This fall, it will be 
expanded to include an anti-gang segment along with a drug and pregnancy 
prevention program for high school students.

SIX PHASES DESCRIBED IN BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clifford Grobstein's book "Science &amp; the Unborn" suggests that life in the 
womb can be separated into six fairly distinct phases: 
</P>
<P>
* Genetic. The two-week "pre-embryo" phase, which begins at conception. The 
unborn develops its "hereditary uniqueness," according to Grobstein. "It is 
essential to keep in mind how much is yet missing at this early stage." 
</P>
<P>
* Developmental. After about two weeks, the rapidly growing pre-embryo attaches 
to the uterine wall. From this point on, "it becomes committed to the 
production of a single individual." 
</P>
<P>
* Functional. After about two months, the embryo -- now identified as a fetus 
-- has developed certain abilities essential to survival. As the fetus 
develops, "it sets the stage for increasing functional individuality, including 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
* Behavioral. This stage is difficult to describe because the unborn at 
different times exhibit various types of behavior, according to Grobstein. 
However, after about six or seven weeks, the development of 
</P>
<P>
nerve and muscle tissue allows basic reflex responses. "Muscles and nervous 
system . . . (are) sufficiently mature . . . (as are) the interactions between 
them," Grobstein says. 
</P>
<P>
* Psychic. While this stage is open to debate, scientists believe that a "sense 
of self" probably doesn't exist until about the 30th week, according to 
Grobstein. He defines psychic as an "inner subjective experience, such as each 
adult is directly aware of." 
</P>
<P>
* Social. "Social individuality" is not a biological phase, according to 
Grobstein. It is instead "conferred through recognition by others. . . . No 
matter how strong the experience of inner self may be, it has no social content 
unless it is recognized by another." GREG JOHNSON

DIVERS REMOVE 3RD STEEL PLATE DANGLING FROM HULL OF VALDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI ROTH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Divers working underneath the Exxon Valdez on Sunday removed a third massive 
steel plate dangling from the oil tanker's hull, and worked to cut away several 
others while seas off San Clemente Island were calm. 
</P>
<P>
The salvage team, fearing that an earlier plan to catch the plates as they fell 
was too dangerous, allowed the plates to drop to the ocean floor, and Exxon 
Shipping Co. officials say they are uncertain whether any of the pieces will be 
retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
The plates, which peeled back from the hull during the Valdez's 2,200-mile trip 
from Alaska, prevent the tanker from clearing the bottom of San Diego Bay, 
where it is scheduled to dry-dock for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state and Exxon completed negotiations of conditions that would 
allow the ship into state waters, but are reviewing final drafts before 
declaring it an agreement, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The salvage crew Saturday cut off the largest of seven plates jutting downward 
from the hull, a piece about 70 feet long and 68 feet wide that weighs about 50 
tons, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The first plate, an 11-ton piece measuring 32 by 15 feet, came off late Friday, 
and the remaining four smaller pieces are expected to be removed during the 
next three to four days, said Jan Cool, a spokeswoman for Exxon Shipping. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan is that they will work as quickly as they can, within conditions of 
maximum safety," Cool said. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel on Sunday was drifting 4 to 6 miles off San Clemente Island, amid 
swells of up to 2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Divers lay on their stomachs inside the ship's open tanks to cut the plates, 
which dropped about 3,000 feet to the ocean floor, Cool said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, divers planned to attach cables to the plates, cut them away bit by 
bit and transfer the pieces to a salvage barge. 
</P>
<P>
But concern that the divers' air and equipment hoses, which stem from the ship 
itself, could become tangled with the cables led to the decision to allow the 
plates to drop, Cool said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard, which has jurisdiction over the federal waters in which 
the ship is drifting, authorized the decision, and is monitoring the location 
of the plates, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was determined that we could not, because of sea conditions, safely remove 
those plates and catch them and yet protect the divers, too," Cool said. "It's 
quite a dangerous situation." 
</P>
<P>
She said it is unlikely that Exxon will retrieve the largest plates, because of 
the danger posed to divers, but that smaller pieces might be collected later. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really no reason why there should be any concern about dropping these 
plates, from an environmental standpoint," she said. "But we will recover the 
ones we can recover safely." 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez was towed from Alaska after hitting a reef there March 24 and 
causing the nation's worst oil spill, along the Prince William Sound shoreline. 
The ship was scheduled to enter San Diego Bay on July 11 for repairs at 
National Steel and Shipbuilding Co., which built the vessel in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But the discovery July 10 of the jutting plates, as well as the slicks and 
discharges, delayed its entry.

2 HURT IN FALL FROM CLIFF AT LA JOLLA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two beachgoers were injured Sunday afternoon after falling 30 feet off a La 
Jolla cliff to the beach below, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Anderson, 35, and a 35-year-old woman, whose name had not been released 
pending notification of relatives, were walking down a trail on a cliff above 
the south end of Black's Beach about 3 p.m. when they realized the trail was a 
false one, a spokesman for the San Diego lifeguards said. 
</P>
<P>
As they tried to make their way down to the beach, they slipped and fell about 
30 feet to a patch of sand and rocks below, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson suffered a fractured leg in the fall, while the woman received a head 
injury. Both were transported to Scripps Memorial Hospital and listed in stable 
condition Sunday night, a spokeswoman for the hospital said.

LEMOND'S FANTASTIC FINISH HAS FIT ENDING; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN WINS TOUR DE FRANCE AS FIGNON LOSES 50-SECOND LEAD OVER 15 MILES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was supposed to be another Bicentennial celebration for a Frenchman on 
the Champs Elysees. Instead, on the Trail of the Revolution, from the Palace of 
Versailles to the Place de la Concorde, it was another glorious day for an 
American in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Greg LeMond, 28, won the Tour de France for the second time in four years. But 
while his 1986 victory was virtually preordained, he had to ride the race of 
his life Sunday to overcome the lead France's Laurent Fignon, 28, built over 
the previous 2,017 miles, 22 days and 20 stages of cycling's greatest 
spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who first began racing as a teen-ager in his hometown of Reno so that 
he could get his legs in shape for skiing, won by eight seconds, the closest 
finish in 76 Tours de France. 
</P>
<P>
The smallest margin previously was the 38-second victory by the Netherlands' 
Jan Janssen over Belgium's Herman Van Springel in 1968, which was the last time 
before Sunday that the tour champion was determined on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone believed there could be another dramatic finish this year when the 
tour began on July 1 in Luxembourg, he certainly would not have imagined that 
LeMond could play anything other than a supporting role in it. 
</P>
<P>
Since becoming the only American to win the tour three years ago, LeMond has 
been near death from gunshot wounds suffered in a 1987 hunting accident, 
fractured his wrist, undergone an emergency appendectomy and knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
After not even competing in the last two tours and losing his place on one of 
the sport's premier teams, LeMond himself said that he would be satisfied with 
a top-20 finish. It was considered remarkable that he was even in position 
Sunday to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
Fignon, a two-time champion, left the treacherous Alps Friday with a 50-second 
advantage, which he maintained through the penultimate stage Saturday on the 
relatively flat road between Aix-les-Bains and l'Isle d'Abeau. 
</P>
<P>
Cycling experts said that the tour was finished. All that remained was Sunday's 
15.2 mile individual time trial, a race against the clock. While it figured 
that LeMond would ride faster than Fignon, it did not figure that the American 
could reduce the lead by more than 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
In a time trial earlier this year in the Tour of Italy, LeMond gained one 
minute, 18 seconds on Fignon. But that was over 31 miles. Similarly, LeMond 
gained 56 seconds on Fignon in the fifth stage of the Tour de France from 
Dinard to Rennes. But that was over 45 miles. LeMond had to gain almost that 
much in little more than 15 miles Sunday. Fignon was confident. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, 50 seconds would be enough," he said Saturday. "Barring an accident, 
I think I've won the tour." 
</P>
<P>
As would be proved 24 hours later, he was too quick with his words and too slow 
on his bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
Starting two minutes ahead of Fignon, LeMond rode the final stage all out at a 
tour time trial record of 34 miles per hour, declining to have his splits 
called to him from the pace cars as he concentrated solely on the finish line, 
where he arrived 26 minutes and 57 seconds after he began. 
</P>
<P>
That gave him his third stage victory, two more than he won when he became the 
only non-European champion in 1986. But he would have to wait to find out 
whether he was fast enough to catch Fignon in the overall standings. The longer 
LeMond waited, the better it looked for him. 
</P>
<P>
Fignon did not shy away from the challenge, finishing third in the time trial. 
But his time of 27:55 was eight seconds too slow to retain the leader's yellow 
jersey. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond completed the 21-stage, 2,030-mile tour in 87 hours, 38 minutes and 35 
seconds. Fignon was second in 87:38.43. Defending champion Pedro Delgado of 
Spain finished third. 
</P>
<P>
When LeMond realized that he had won, he raised both arms over his head in 
triumph, yelped and began eluding reporters, photographers and fans in a search 
for his wife and father. He and his wife, Kathy, and their two children split 
time between their two homes in Wayzata, Minn. Kortrijk, Belgium. His father, 
Bob, lives in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Fignon collapsed at the finish line, tears streaming down his cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was the happiest day of my life," said LeMond, who was born in Lakewood. 
"It can't be compared to my first victory, which was assured before the final 
days. Even if I win another tour some day, it will not be the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Laurent was more nervous than I was. He had everything to lose. I told 
myself at the start that I had nothing to lose. I told myself, 'So what if I 
explode?' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still in a state of shock. This victory is just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Fignon was disconsolate. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in my career, I cried," he said. "It doesn't matter if it 
was by eight, 10, 20 or 30 seconds. I lost the yellow jersey." 
</P>
<P>
Fignon, who has not always been gracious toward his former teammate, 
congratulated LeMond. But the Frenchman also complained about an inflamed 
buttocks that caused him discomfort in the saddle Sunday. And he protested the 
looped, triathlon handlebars on LeMond's bicycle that allow him to crouch in a 
better aerodynamic position. Officials ruled that the handlebars are legal. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond and Fignon exchanged the yellow jersey four times over the last 17 days 
of the tour. LeMond first took the lead after the time trial that ended at 
Rennes on July 6, reclaimed it 10 days later after another time trial that 
ended at Orcieres-Merlette and then lost it last Wednesday at l'Alpe d'Huez. 
</P>
<P>
That was the day Fignon pulled away from the pack with a surprise attack 2 1/2 
miles from the end of a steep, uphill climb to l'Alpe d'Huez, turning a 
40-second deficit into a 26-second advantage over LeMond. The next day, Fignon 
made a similar move on the climb to Villard-de-Lans, extending his lead to 50 
seconds. LeMond won Friday's stage, the final one in the Alps, but he failed to 
gain ground on Fignon and appeared to be destined for a second-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at and beyond my limits for several days in a row," LeMond said. "No one 
but myself knew how much I suffered." 
</P>
<P>
But he said that he never quit believing that he could win. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew I could come back," he said. "There was a time when only my 
family believed in me. I was shocked at how many people gave up on me when I 
was down." 
</P>
<P>
He could have said the same thing about the last three years. Until 1987, he 
had a charmed career. He was the world junior road race champion in 1977, the 
Tour l'Avenir champion in 1982 and the world road race champion in 1983. He 
finished third in his first Tour de France in 1984, second in 1985 and won it 
in 1986 while riding with the strong La Vie Claire team. 
</P>
<P>
He left La Vie Claire after 1987 and signed with another dominant team, PDM of 
the Netherlands. But after his second straight season of injuries, illness and 
disappointing results, PDM did not pick up his option. With no other suitable 
offers, he signed with a poorly-financed Belgian team, ADR, which gained 
entrance into the 22-team Tour de France when another team withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
In May's Tour of Italy, LeMond finished 39th and said he had never been so 
poorly prepared for a Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people asked whether I was bluffing before the Tour de France after I 
was riding so poorly," he said Sunday. "Maybe I was saving myself. But I am not 
that type of racer. I have to always do my best." 
</P>
<P>
People will think twice before doubting him again. That includes his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not think he was going to win," she said after Sunday's thrilling 
finish. "I was afraid he would lose by a few seconds. Now he can go out and 
dance all night."

HALL OF FAME, ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY, MORE THAN AN IDENTITY FOR COOPERSTOWN 
</P>

COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Walker had just rung up a $110 sale for a framed and signed photograph of 
Bobby Thomson and Ralph Branca, and he paused to look at a clutch of customers 
peering into the window of his high-priced (a signed Don Mattingly bat and 
ball: $525) baseball fine-arts shop. 
</P>
<P>
"People are in a state of grace here," said Walker, a native of Cooperstown who 
ventured into merchandising baseball art and artifacts four years ago. "People 
seem to be praying at the store window. They really are pilgrims." 
</P>
<P>
On a breezy morning a week before the ritual induction of players Carl 
Yastrzemski, Johnny Bench, Red Schoendienst and umpire Al Barlick into the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, hundreds of pilgrims moved in a 
reverential mass along Main Street toward the national pastime's shrine, the 
main attraction of this central New York village of 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agent Don Olin, a dead-ringer for ex-major league manager Dick 
Williams, gazed at the growing herd of Hall-bound fans. Families. A troop of 
Boy Scouts. Nearly everybody wearing a team cap or shirt. Well-behaved folks. 
</P>
<P>
Olin, who only recently visited the Hall for the first time since he was a boy, 
said, "No question about the Hall's effect on business here. If not for the 
Hall, people wouldn't be walking the streets of this quaint little village. 
They say there are 80 bed and breakfasts in the area. None of them would be 
here without the Hall." 
</P>
<P>
This is the Hall of Fame's 50th anniversary, a half-century since benefactor 
Stephen Clark Sr. built the museum in a small village best known, until then, 
for its historic link to "Leatherstocking Tales" author James Fenimore Cooper, 
whose wealthy father, William, founded Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
Today, despite the Hall's serene, rural location, five hours from New York 
City, it is drawing record crowds. Attendance grew to a best-ever 308,995 last 
year, a 50% increase since 1984. By the start of the peak vacation seaon in 
early July, it already had jumped 32% from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the ever-surging interest in baseball, publicity about the 50th 
anniversary (celebrated June 10 with a Main Street parade and the unveiling of 
a Lou Gehrig stamp by the U.S. Postal Service), the popularity of Bench and 
Yastrzemski or, simply, word-of-mouth. The Hall must rely on what others say 
and write about it because of its modest advertising budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason for spending big on advertising," said the Hall's director, 
Howard Talbot Jr., who started work at the Hall as its accountant in 1951. 
"We're out of the way and there's a limit to how many people we can handle." 
</P>
<P>
The best advertising is media coverage of the annual induction on the steps of 
the Hall's library, where as many as 6,271 fans have gathered. Now a three-day 
affair, Hall of Fame weekend stretches from golf and tennis tournaments on 
Saturday to the induction Sunday to the Hall of Fame Game Monday between the 
Boston Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds. The weekend's $150,000 cost is underwritten 
by a $90,000 contribution by the Equitable Financial Cos.; the Hall covers the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the crowd will see the first expansion of the Hall since 1980. A new 
wing, unveiled last month in an old gymnasium donated by the Clark family 
foundation, adds 18,000 square feet of office and display space, including a 
new ornament: A 200-seat theater designed like an old ballpark that features a 
slickly-produced 15-minute film extolling the childlike joys of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The $7.5-million expansion probably wouldn't have happened without the Hall's 
growing bottom-line success. On top of $1.2 million donations from Boston Red 
Sox part-owner Jean Yawkey and former Detroit Tiger owner John Fetzer, the Hall 
used a revenue surplus and more than $2 million in bank loans to finance 
construction of the modern new wing. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had to go out and buy that building on our own, it would have cost three 
or four million dollars," Hall president Edward Stack said. "So this whole 
expansion is really worth more than 10 million dollars." 
</P>
<P>
On deck is a planned modernization and expansion of the library -- the foremost 
repository of baseball research in the world with 5 million newspaper documents 
and 125,000 photographs -- which won't come until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make it easier for the staff to locate things," Talbot said. 
"Computerization will make it easy to keep track of material, make copies of 
photos and documents. We want to open up more area to researchers, and put 
valuable documents on microfilm." 
</P>
<P>
For all its swelling attendance and stature as the key attraction in this 
affluent village of well-tended Victorian, Colonial, stone and simple frame 
houses, the Hall is a fairly small business, dwarfed by the nearby Mary Imogene 
Bassett Hospital. Cooperstown is also the seat of Otsego County, bringing in 
500 county workers daily. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Hall has only 45 full-time, year-round employees, a staff that 
has increased to 140 for the peak vacation time. It will operate this year with 
a budget of about $3.25 million, which Talbot says will increase in 1990 with 
full-year costs to maintain the new wing. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall made $1.2 million in admission fees in 1988, which could reach $1.6 
million if the current attendance trend continues. Gift shop and catalogue 
sales, which made $2.5 million last year and are already up 80% in the first 
half of 1989, will probably approach $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Another $1 million should come from several licensing deals, up from $783,000 
in 1988. The bulk of the licensing money comes from a deal with Leaf Donruss to 
make Hall of Fame trading cards, puzzles and postcards from artist Dick Perez's 
Hall of Famer paintings. In addition, the Hall should get about $12,500 from 
its take of Hall of Fame Game receipts, and another $15,000 from Major League 
Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Hall officials are exploring other licensing agreements, but Talbot and Stack 
are not in a hurry. Stack is negotiating with a car company to sponsor the new 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to commercialize things," he said. "This is very low-key." 
</P>
<P>
Said Talbot: "We're very fussy." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the presence of more baseball-oriented items in the village each year 
(even the pharmacy sells baseball memorabilia) and soaring real estate values 
pushed by the partial Yuppification of the village, Cooperstown, like the Hall, 
is fussy and low-key. Sure, there's more traffic than villagers care to have, 
but Cooperstown is a clean and uncluttered place. 
</P>
<P>
Village ordinances forbid neon and flashing signs (there's only one traffic 
light), and signs deemed too large, too high or too close to the sidewalk. 
Three old-fashioned trolleys (dubbed Deerslayer, Natty Bumppo and Hawkeye) move 
without San Francisco-like clanging for 50 cents a ride. Main Street's retail 
strip is quiet by 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Hollis, the 75-year-old mayor of Cooperstown, who covered the first Hall 
of Fame Game in 1939 for the local newspaper, the Freemen's Journal, said: "We 
don't want to look like some kind of tourist trap like Lake George." 
</P>
<P>
But tourism is crucial to Cooperstown's business life, and the Hall is the 
primary destination. For every three people who visit the Hall, one-and-a-half 
visit the village's other main attractions, the Farmers Museum and the Fenimore 
House (on the site of Ambrose Clark's private horse-racing track). The more 
music-minded Hall pilgrims also attend the Glimmerglass Opera, which earlier 
this month featured William Schuman's opera, "The Mighty Casey." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the village would survive as a pleasant rural burg without it, the Hall 
provides considerable economic impact. No studies have been done, but a rough 
calculation shows that if each person spends an average of $50-a-day on food 
and lodging, the impact would be $20 million, which doesn't account for how 
many times those dollars turn over locally or spending by Hall employees. 
</P>
<P>
Without the Hall, the bed and breakfast would not be as prevalent although some 
of the inns, motels and hotels such as the stately Otesaga Hotel would surely 
survive because of Cooperstown's aesthetic charm. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't move here because the Hall was here," said Michael Jerome, owner of 
The Inn at Cooperstown, "but I don't think I'd be in business without it. 
Eighty to ninety percent of my guests come to see the Hall. But once they've 
been here, they've come again for other things." 
</P>
<P>
Added Hollis, the mayor: "I was talking to a woman about 80 years old the other 
day. She's got no interest in baseball. But she said, 'I'd rather have it like 
this than the average small village. The other places, shoot, don't have this 
kind of activity.' The Hall give Cooperstown a lot more recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Without the thousands of artifacts of baseball contained within its display 
cases and archives, the Hall wouldn't generate much outside recognition. It is 
the perfect museum for its fans. The value of its collection is seen as 
incalculable by adoring baseball fans. And if destroyed, it is irreplaceable -- 
especially in the current climate of soaring trading cards and memorabilia 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
There's Babe Ruth's red locker stall. Bob Feller's first no-hitter ball. Lou 
Gehrig's address book. A watch Connie Mack gave to Clark Griffith on the 
latter's 50th wedding anniversary. Shoeless Joe Jackson's shoes. Rube Waddell's 
shotgun. Christy Mathewson's Bible. 
</P>
<P>
All this is insured for a "fair value" of $2.12 million under a fine-arts 
policy. Put everything on the market, and they could be worth $20 million. 
Maybe more. Who knows what somebody would pay for the locker used in different 
eras by Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle? 
</P>
<P>
"The evaluation is less than the items would bring on the open market," Talbot 
said. "But if we valued it that way, we couldn't afford it. We put a fair value 
on it. Rates are up drastically. If it continues, it will hurt us. That's why 
we've spent $75,000 to upgrade our fire and security system." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings Talbot to a sticky subject: paying for artifacts. The Hall never 
has, existing always on donations. The memorabilia market has roiled that 
policy, with reports such as Pete Rose selling some of his history-making bats 
and balls and the competition for other important pieces such as George Brett's 
pine tar bat (owned by a collector but now on loan to the Hall). 
</P>
<P>
Even shopkeeper Doug Walker owns a 1939 baseball, autographed by Ruth, Ty Cobb, 
Hank Greenberg, Mel Ott and others, who were all present at the first Hall of 
Fame game. Not that the Hall has missed too many notable pieces and quick work 
by team officials at the site of a major occasion usually gets most of what the 
Hall desires. But profit-motivated dealers want what the Hall used to get 
automatically. 
</P>
<P>
"We will never pay for anything," Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Stack: "I'm not saying we'll never pay. But I'd hate to get into that 
routine. People have to be sensible about it. The players who achieve records 
should look to the Hall as the place where their things will be enjoyed and 
preserved forever. 
</P>
<P>
"They shouldn't look for a chance to make money. We're preserving the future. 
Even some of the collectors who've paid for things we've missed are coming 
around. After some have enjoyed having something, they'll give it to the Hall 
of Fame. They'll get a tax deduction and feel they've made a contribution."

AGASSI IS THE U.S. DOWNFALL IN LOSS TO WEST GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Andre Agassi skipped the Wimbledon tennis tournament again this year, an 
enterprising Britisher made a killing by selling "Where's Andre?" T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
That same question was applicable Sunday. And the answer was simple: Agassi 
went south in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The young and unpredictable U.S. Davis Cup player looked even younger and more 
unpredictable in a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 loss to Carl-Uwe Steeb. The match gave 
the West Germans their third and deciding point in the Davis Cup best-of-five 
semifinal competition, which they ended up winning, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
They did it without having to call in their big gun, Boris Becker, Sunday. 
Becker was scheduled to play Brad Gilbert in the second match of the day, the 
match expected to be the decider. 
</P>
<P>
But Agassi went down to defeat unceremoniously, making Gilbert's victory over 
Patrick Kuhnen meaningless and raising questions of just how much of the U.S. 
Davis Cup program Agassi took down with him. 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, with Rick Leach and Jim Pugh waiting in the wings, the doubles 
team of Ken Flach and Robert Seguso is out. Their best chance to continue was a 
U.S. team victory Sunday, which would have meant a spot in the Davis Cup 
finals. Team captain Tom Gorman was unlikely to break up a successful team, 
even if Flach and Seguso lost for the first time in 11 Davis Cup doubles 
matches Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Also, how long John McEnroe, at 30, will remain fit, sharp and motivated for 
the long hauls that Davis Cup competition demands is a key question. The man 
who holds nearly every U.S. record for participation and winning in the Davis 
Cup would certainly be eager for another final, but maybe less so for a restart 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the question of Gorman, the personable captain who has, in 
his four years in that capacity, failed to get the United States into the 
finals. The U.S. Tennis Assn. makes the call on the captain, and for a country 
and a tennis program that has won the Davis Cup more than any other (28) and 
hasn't had a title since 1982, patience could be wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I want to be back," Gorman said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi's demise Sunday couldn't have helped anybody. Nor could it have been 
timed more strangely. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old from Las Vegas has been controversial almost since he emerged 
onto the international tennis scene. He has been criticized for being cocky, 
arrogant and insensitive -- sometimes all in the same sentence. Many other 
players, as pointed out by Steeb in the post-match press conference, don't like 
him because he showboats on the court, makes them look bad and then laughs at 
them. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, his game and his ranking have begun to slip ever so slightly. 
</P>
<P>
So it was with great interest that many watched his opening match and demeanor 
against Becker Friday night and Saturday. Even though Agassi lost in five sets, 
they were five of the most stirring sets played. And they were made even better 
when Agassi merely played -- no cutesy stuff, no little games with linespeople 
or the crowd, no sulking when things went badly. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Agassi leaped over the net, hugged Becker, then marched to 
the interview room to face reporters and give credit to Becker. 
</P>
<P>
"He got lots of respect back here," Steeb said. "He acted like a real sportsman 
after he lost that match." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, this appeared to be the new and improved Andre Agassi. He skipped 
Wimbledon to get ready for this, he said. And with McEnroe out, he had taken on 
his new role of team leader with enthusiasm. He had a new trainer, a man from 
Kentucky named Pat Etcheberry, who was helping him with his diet and his 
conditioning. No more sprees of hamburgers, milkshakes and fries. 
</P>
<P>
"I can go the distance now," Agassi told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, he barely went four sets. Steeb, ranked 23rd in the world to Agassi's 
sixth, went through him in 28 minutes in the fourth set. By the time Agassi had 
his third point in the set, Steeb led, 5-0. One of those three points came on 
an ace, another on a double-fault by Steeb. Even fighting back for two games, 
Agassi won only 13 points in the set. 
</P>
<P>
"In the locker room during the break (after the third set)," Agassi said, "I 
was pacing around, back and forth and back and forth, saying I was right there. 
A couple of more points in the third set and it would have been me, up two sets 
to one." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, at a set apiece, Agassi started the third set fast, serving and 
volleying and breaking Steeb for a 2-0 lead. In the third game, he served and 
volleyed his way to a 40-love lead before disintegrating, as Steeb started to 
take advantage of this unexpected target at the net. Steeb broke Agassi's serve 
for a 3-2 lead and served out the 6-4 set, while Agassi began to look like a 
rudderless ship. 
</P>
<P>
He still was coming into the net frequently, on Steeb's serve as well as his 
own, and he even started hitting low-percentage topspin swinging volleys. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared as if Agassi simply decided to take charge and get this over 
quickly, so Gilbert could come out and try to work a miracle against Becker. 
But to Steeb, the new aggressive tactics meant something else, something rather 
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"When he kept serving and volleying," Steeb said, "I saw it as a sign that he 
was getting tired. I think he decided he couldn't play a long match." 
</P>
<P>
After the match turned around in the third set, Agassi appeared to be so 
disinterested that he didn't even chase some of the balls slightly out of his 
reach. That seemed particularly out of place during a Davis Cup competition 
that earlier featured Becker diving all over the court. 
</P>
<P>
So Agassi's endurance and desire both became topics of conversation afterward, 
raising questions about his slightly sore knee, which he said was no problem, 
and, more figuratively, about his heart. One German reporter, in broken 
English, referred to him as America's Tinman. And Steeb didn't go out of his 
way to refute that theory. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see he's not a player who can come back when he's down," Steeb said. 
"When he's ahead, he's all over you. But it is easy to fight when you are up. 
Maybe he just isn't a player who can go five sets or come back when he's down. 
</P>
<P>
"If he is keeping up like this, maybe he is getting a reputation for being like 
that. The best thing to do against somebody like that is to just beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Steeb notwithstanding, Gorman remains an Agassi fan and apologist. 
</P>
<P>
"It just takes time with a young player like Andre," Gorman said. "Right now, 
he is No. 6 in the world, but there will come a day when, as No. 6 in the 
world, he will be able to dominate a No. 23 (Steeb). 
</P>
<P>
"The match just turned there early in the third set, and Steeb's confidence 
soared and Agassi's dropped. I tried to slow him down, but he's a fast player, 
anyway, and soon it just got away from him." 
</P>
<P>
And away from a U.S. team that, as recently as last Wednesday Gorman was 
calling a favorite to make the final. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just so terribly disappointing, losing like this," Gorman said, "because 
we were so close here." 
</P>
<P>
Until the mysterious disappearance of Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Davis Cup Notes 
</P>
<P>
Brad Gilbert won the final match Sunday, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, over Patrick Kuhnen. 
Kuhnen replaced Boris Becker, who was said to be unable to play because he was 
fighting off a fever. Davis Cup rules necessitate that a team give a reason for 
substituting a player. Had Andre Agassi defeated Carl-Uwe Steeb, Becker's fever 
presumably would have disappeared, like magic. . . . The match was shortened to 
best-of-three sets because West Germany had already won its third point. . . . 
Sweden beat Yugoslavia in the other semifinal, meaning that this year's Davis 
Cup final will be somewhere in West Germany, Dec. 15-17.

SPLIT TAKES STEAM OUT OF DODGERS; 
</P>
<P>
REYNOLDS HAUNTS THEM IN GAME 2; GIBSON ON DISABLED LIST 
</P>

<P>
After 5 1/2 hours of baseball here Sunday, the Dodgers' clubhouse was as silent 
as the Bat Day crowd at Three Rivers Stadium had been loud. Faces were turned 
toward lockers. Expressions turned blank. 
</P>
<P>
In one afternoon, they had lost both their leader and this new element called 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The day began when the Dodgers placed outfielder Kirk Gibson on the disabled 
list for his sore legs, a move that could keep him out the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
It ended when the team came within three innings of a doubleheader sweep of the 
Pittsburgh Pirates before blowing the second game and the afternoon with a 2-1, 
10-inning loss on R.J. Reynolds' run-scoring single. Thanks to Kal Daniels' 
two-run homer and diving catch, they had won the first game, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
With Cincinnati, San Diego and San Francisco losing, the Dodgers could have 
left the stadium having moved up two places in the standings. But instead of 
being tied for third place, the split kept them in fourth, 12 1/2 games behind 
the first-place Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"We just missed," said Orel Hershiser, who won the first game. "It would have 
been great." 
</P>
<P>
On a muggy afternoon against a couple of young Pittsburgh starting pitchers, 
think about what it would have been like if the "old" Gibson was in the lineup. 
But then, because of bad legs that have severely limited his mobility, the old 
Gibson hasn't really been in the lineup all year. 
</P>
<P>
He had earlier been on the disabled list for 27 days with a hamstring problem. 
In 71 games, he has hit .213, and has been unable to chase down some balls he 
would usually reach in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's announcement merely made this official, with Gibson hinting for the 
first time that his problems are serious. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can get back to speed, but I don't know how long it's going to be -- 
it could be a long time," said Gibson, who was diagnosed as having a sprained 
right knee and a chronic left hamstring strain. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to get it right," he added. "When I come back, it will be right." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, Dodger vice president, stressed that Gibson would not be rushed. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that he is on the disabled list, no one is going to push him in any way," 
Claire said. "Kirk and the doctors will determine the state of his health. He 
will receive no pressure from anyone." 
</P>
<P>
It's a good thing somebody around here won't feel any pressure. Before a crowd 
of 34,373, the Dodgers' afternoon was ruined by a pressure situation in which 
their relievers struggled, while a former Dodger thrived. 
</P>
<P>
You remember R.J. Reynolds. He played in the Dodger organization for most of 
the first six years of his pro career until being traded to the Pirates in 
September, 1985, as part of the deal that brought third baseman Bill Madlock to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At least one Pirate teammate said Reynolds remembers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a little personal vendetta there," Andy Van Slyke said. "You can see 
it in his face." 
</P>
<P>
In his batting average, too. Reynolds entered Sunday with a .319 career average 
against the Dodgers. In the first game he had a two-run double. After the 
Pirates had tied the second game, at 1-1, in the seventh inning against rookie 
starter John Wetteland, Reynolds had a chance to win it in the 10th with 
runners on first and second and right-hander Tim Crews pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds walked to the plate with a .288 career average against right-handers 
and a .333 mark against left-handers. He didn't want to face Crews. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to face a left-hander because I knew there weren't any left-handers 
in their bullpen who I couldn't get the bat around good on," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
So what did the Dodgers do? They brought in left-hander Ray Searage. One pitch 
later, Reynolds bounced the ball into left field for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
"He hadn't batted from the right side all day, we wanted to take him out of his 
comfort zone," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. "And with him standing on that 
side of the plate, there was a greater chance of a double-play grounder." 
</P>
<P>
Said Reynolds: "The Dodgers have never been like something special to me. I 
guess I don't feel that mystique. When I was there I kept my mouth shut and sat 
in the corner and watched." 
</P>
<P>
As the new owner of a .300 batting average (.302), Reynolds smiled. "Really, I 
don't feel any vengeance when I come to the plate against the Dodgers. I guess 
it just looks that way." 
</P>
<P>
And Sunday had once looked so bright for his former team. After the Gibson 
announcement, the Dodgers glided through Game 1, breaking a 2-2 tie in the 
fifth inning on Daniels' first homer as a Dodger. He drove a Randy Kramer 
fastball over the right field fence to score Willie Randolph, who had doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Two innings later Daniels robbed pinch-hitter John Cangelosi of an extra-base 
hit with a diving catch in the gap. 
</P>
<P>
"Kal won that game all by himself," said Hershiser, who gave up three runs in 7 
2/3 innings to improve to 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
John Wetteland was impressive in his Game 2 start Sunday, only the rookie's 
second start of the year. "I didn't want any part of him," said Pittsburgh's 
R.J. Reynolds. "He was throwing some mean, mean stuff." Afterward, when 
Wetteland was asked what he thought, he replied, "What do I think about what? 
The rising price of sand?" Wetteland had given up only two hits until his 
ill-fated seventh inning, when, with one out, he walked Glenn Wilson and then 
gave up a two-out RBI double to Junior Ortiz. That hit tied the score and sent 
Wetteland to the dugout. "I only walked two in the game, but that one was bad 
timing," said Wetteland, who lowered his ERA to 2.20 despite no decision. "And 
then I challenged a high-fastball hitter with a high fastball and I lost. With 
most of the other teams losing, this game was important, and tough to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Tim Crews, who started the Pirates' winning rally by giving up a 
first-pitch double to Jay Bell leading off the 10th inning, wanted to face 
Reynolds. "I was hoping they'd leave me in there -- using my split-finger 
fastball I've gotten Reynolds out a lot of time with ground balls," Crews said. 
"But that's their decision. What can I say? This is a job." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall's 13-game hitting streak ended in Game 1 Sunday as he went 0 for 
3 with a walk. He has hit in 16 of 21 games since coming off the disabled list 
July 1, going 19 for 54 (.352) during that time to improve his average to .259. 
. . . The Dodgers played 46 innings this weekend, and only first baseman Eddie 
Murray and shortstop Alfredo Griffin played each one. Murray has yet to miss a 
start in the Dodgers' 99 games this year, the only player with such a mark. . . 
. Dodger announcer Don Drysdale was released from Centinela Hospital Medical 
Center Sunday and will likely rejoin the team in San Diego. He was hospitalized 
Thursday with chest pains. . . . The Dodgers will have the pleasure of facing 
leading Cy Young Award candidate Mike Scott (15-5) in Houston Wednesday, 
matching him against Fernando Valenzuela (5-9). In Tuesday's series opener, 
Dodger Tim Belcher (6-9) will face Houston's Bob Knepper (4-10), while in 
Thursday's finale Ramon Martinez (2-0) will face Jim Deshaies (10-4).

Thunderstorms played havoc with outdoor events Sunday at the U.S. Olympic 
Festival, turning the spotlight indoors, where Olympic champion wrestlers Kenny 
Monday and Dave Schultz battled just to get into the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the 1988 Olympic gold medalist from Stillwater, Okla., earned a 6-3 
victory over Schultz, 1984 Olympic gold medalist, which led to Schultz's 
elimination from the 163.5-pound freestyle wrestling mini-tournament. Monday 
won two more matches in the evening to advance. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be a little closer," said Monday, who wrestled at Oklahoma 
State. "I thought I was in control, but I never thought I had the match won. In 
freestyle, you can't afford to give up, especially with a guy like Dave 
Schultz. You never know what he's going to pull." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, who coached the national team before deciding to return to 
competition, couldn't pull out anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrestled real poor, real poor," he said. "I've got nothing good to say about 
the way I wrestled." 
</P>
<P>
The mini-tournament at 163.5 was loaded with former champions, including the 
two Olympic gold medalists and five National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
Monday defeated David Lee, the NCAA champion this year from Wisconsin, and 
Eddie Urbano, a former NCAA title winner from Arizona State, exchanging words 
with Urbano after the 6-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
At 125.5 pounds, identical twins Tony and Nick Purler of Wentzville, Mo., 
refused to wrestle each other, keeping a pact they made in the eighth grade. 
Because Tony won on injury default -- although no injury exists -- Nick also 
could continue to compete in the mini-tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I petitioned in at 125 and he petitioned in at 114 but was unable to make 
weight," Tony said. "We drew each other. That's never happened before in a 
blind draw. It's only right that he should default. 
</P>
<P>
"It stinks that that had to happen, but he didn't make weight." 
</P>
<P>
In the boxing semifinals, three of four U.S. amateur titlists advanced. But 
super heavyweight Larry Donald of Cincinnati won a unanimous decision over 
national champion Eddie Donerlson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Donald, a shoe salesman who began boxing only two years ago, predicted a gold 
medal was in his future. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to see some big things come Tuesday night (against Kelvin 
Richardson)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The amateur champions who won were four-time national titlist Brian Lonon at 
112 pounds; Frank Pena at 125 pounds; and Chris Byrd at 156 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
In afternoon basketball, the East women remained unbeaten with a 66-61 victory 
over the West as Valeria Whiting of Stanford had 10 points and 10 rebounds. The 
teams combined for 48 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when you say it's a shame that anyone had to lose a ballgame. 
Today was one that it's a shame anyone had to win," East Coach Chris Gobrecht 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The East men beat the West,94-87,in overtime. Todd Day of Arkansas scored 16 
points, including five in overtime.

WYLIE TAKES SECOND LOOK AT SKATING PRIORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Barely had Paul Wylie a chance to reflect upon or savor his surprising 
10th-place finish at the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary when he began to hear 
the sighs and whispers that presage the end of a career at sport's upper 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
And, although the Olympics had been his first major competition at skating's 
senior level and his finish was more than respectable, Wylie began to listen to 
the talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are really inclined to do that," Wylie said Sunday before the 
free-skating final at the Olympic Festival here. "People are living off other 
people's mistakes in this sport. You just have to live above that. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how people are. I probably was like that when I was younger. They won't 
miss you as a skater, they see you as a notch out. A space for them to move 
into." 
</P>
<P>
Wylie, 24, was tacitly erased from contention by some observers in the sport 
when he placed third at the national championships in February, thus failing to 
qualify for the U.S. team that was sent to the World Championships. In a sport 
based on subjective judging such as skating, it is simply that easy to lose 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Wylie chose to skate in this competition -- out of season and partially 
out of shape -- to proclaim his return and reclaim his place behind Christopher 
Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to skate here has proved to be a gamble. Wylie muffed the landing 
on the first jump in his long program Sunday and still managed to get a 5.9 (on 
a scale of 6) from one judge. However, that mistake was enough to give Mark 
Mitchell of Hamden, Conn., the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Wylie, who is from Denver and lives in Boston, was a distant second. Shepherd 
Clark of Atlanta won the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to losing ground to a younger skater, Wylie showed a vulnerability 
to judges, who will not likely forget. 
</P>
<P>
Wylie, however, is determined not to forget what he is here for. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the media before the short program (at nationals) that it might be the 
last time I skated," Wylie said. "It was really awful. I didn't enjoy it. The 
questions still were there." 
</P>
<P>
Wylie reassessed his priorities after that competition. As skater Debi Thomas 
had done at Stanford, Wylie had steadfastly refused to cut back his class load 
at Harvard, where he is a second-semester junior. That stance has changed, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
"My plans are to take my school schedule easier and make sure that I'm taking 
care of skating for the next three years," he said. "I don't know exactly the 
load I will carry but it will not be a full load. Before I wasn't sure of the 
priority skating held for me. I know that it does mean something to me." 
</P>
<P>
Wylie has been experiencing the dual guilt pangs associated with years of 
compromising his studies and compromising his training. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never practiced on a Wednesday, for example, because of school," he said. 
"To take one day off a week may not seem like a big deal. But I was skating 
five days a week and my competitors were skating six. There was a lack of 
continuity. I'd walk in Thursday and say, 'I should have been here yesterday.' 
There was guilt and there was a feeling of helplessness. I thought, 'When am I 
going to school?' " 
</P>
<P>
The conflicting emotions collided at the national championships last February 
at Baltimore, where Wylie admitted he was not prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that I could train and go to school full time and make the World 
team," he said. "I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Wylie also experienced a singular moment during a performance when he failed to 
complete the first jump of a combination and -- because of pride and obstinacy 
he said -- he refused to even attempt the second jump. This, from a skater who 
molded a career as an expert and facile jumper. 
</P>
<P>
"In Calgary I missed the first jump in my program and the rest the program was 
way better," Wylie said. "That's what was missing, that tenacity and 
perseverance that I expect from myself." 
</P>
<P>
Wylie knew that some sort of change was in order. He said he didn't rule out 
quitting, but sought other solutions first. He tried new equipment, 
experimenting with all manner of boots and blades, finally going back to his 
old equipment. He took weeks off to refresh his mind. 
</P>
<P>
The change that seemed to click was a move at the end of June to train in Vail, 
Colo. with coaches Mary and Evy Scotvold. There he has stripped his skating to 
its basics and, in the process, discovered the joy he used to know. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me until Vail, until I saw the old jumps coming back," he said. "They 
weren't old, really, they were rejuvenated. I found how fun it is to do things 
well, how much I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
It is too soon to tell if the reconstitution of Paul Wylie is complete. It is 
too soon and figure skating is too unpredictable to raise hopes of even the 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
It is even too soon to report that the talk of Wylie being washed up is over, 
yet. All that can be said with any assurance is that he is no longer listening 
to anything but his inner voice. And he is happy with what he hears. 
</P>
<P>
Kristi Yamaguchi, 18, of Fremont, Calif., won the gold in women's figure 
skating, ranking first with all seven judges. 
</P>
<P>
"The program wasn't fully in, with all the choreography, until three weeks 
before this competition," she said. "I just wanted to come and try out the new 
program and see how it worked. I'm pretty happy with it, but I know I have a 
lot of work to do. 
</P>
<P>
Other gold medalists were April Sargent, of Ogdensburg, N.Y., and Russ 
Witherby, of Cincinnati, in ice dancing and Calla Urbanski, of Chicago, and 
Mark Naylor, of Harrisburg, Pa., in pairs competition.

BUMP-AND-GRIND WIN FOR MICHAEL ANDRETTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Andretti had the lead, but he knew better than to expect smooth 
sailing. 
</P>
<P>
Andretti was able to overcome the adversity that has dogged him all season when 
he survived a bump with Emerson Fittipaldi with two laps remaining to win the 
Molson Indy race Sunday at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just sorry that it ended that way," Andretti said after snapping a 23-race 
winless string. "I didn't know he was there. He was just a spot in my mirror 
before that. He must have had a lot of straightaway speed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised by him. I was braking later in that turn. I guess I 
didn't give him enough room. I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
"Other than that, it was just our day." 
</P>
<P>
It could have been Andretti's year. He had the lead in seven of the previous 
eight races before mechanical problems or accidents knocked him out. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi, angry and accusatory when he jumped from his car after finishing 
second, calmed down by the time he and Andretti were face-to-face in Victory 
Circle. 
</P>
<P>
"He apologized and I believe him," Fittipaldi said of Andretti's account of the 
bumping incident. "I'm very disappointed. I was there already. I don't know 
what happened to Michael. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy, with the circumstances, to finish second." 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Andretti led for the final 23 laps of the 103-lap, 183-mile 
race, Fittipaldi charged into the picture in the final 10 laps, coming from an 
eight-second deficit to challenge for the lead on the main straightaway on lap 
102. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi tried to squeeze his Penske PC18-Chevrolet beneath Andretti's 
Chevrolet-powered Lola as the two darted toward the first turn on the 
1.78-mile, 11-turn temporary circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Andretti's left rear tire touched Fittipaldi's right front, and Fittipaldi slid 
into a runoff area. He finished 12.08 seconds behind Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi, who holds a big lead in the CART-PPG season point battle, has two 
straight second-place finishes added to four victories in the previous five 
races. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Sullivan, who finished second in each of the three previous Toronto 
races, was third a lap behind the leaders. Teo Fabi of Italy was fourth, 
another lap back, followed by Rick Mears. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Bill Elliott passed Rusty Wallace with six laps left and 
held on to win the caution-filled $527,567 AC Spark Plug 500 NASCAR race at 
Long Pond, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, defending Winston Cup series champion, took the lead on the 195th of 
200 laps and held on for his fourth career victory on the 2 1/2-mile tri-oval 
at Pocono International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, driving a Ford, edged Wallace, in a Pontiac, by 2.21 seconds. Mark 
Martin finished third, followed by Darrell Waltrip and Harry Gant. 
</P>
<P>
Before Elliott made his charge, Wallace was busy holding off Geoff Bodine's 
Chevrolet after taking the lead on lap 173. But Bodine spun in lap 187 and 
couldn't challenge again. He finished 17th. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott's second victory of the year gave him a boost in his bid to close the 
gap on leader Dale Earnhardt in the season points race. Elliott picked up 180 
points, giving him 2,153 and moving him from fifth place to fourth. Earnhardt, 
who finished ninth and gained 143 points, has 2,314. 
</P>
<P>
Mauro Baldi of Italy and Kenny Acheson of Britain drove a Mercedes to victory 
in a World Sports Prototype Championship auto race at Brands Hatch, England. 
</P>
<P>
The Mercedes finished 115 laps around the 2.6-mile track in 2 hours 41 minutes 
37.7 seconds, giving the West German manufacturer its third victory in four 
races this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldi-Acheson Mercedes finished 77 seconds ahead of a Porsche driven by Bob 
Wollek and Frank Jelinski. Another Mercedes, driven by Jean-Louis Schlesser and 
Jochen Mass, placed third.

Amy Alcott shot her fourth straight 68 Sunday to win the Boston Five tournament 
at Danvers, Mass., by three strokes with a 16-under-par 272 total -- best score 
this year on the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Alcott, who moved to third on the LPGA's all-time earnings list, began the day 
with a two-shot lead over Shirley Furlong. It never dropped below three after 
Alcott birdied the second hole.

Curt Byrum joined his brother as a first-time winner on the PGA Tour this year 
by coming from behind to win the Hardee's tournament at Coal Valley, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Byrum, whose brother, Tom, won the Kemper Open in June, shot a four-under-par 
66 for a 268 total and capitalized on the collapse of defending champion Blaine 
McCallister to finish one shot ahead of Brian Tennyson and Bill Britton. 
</P>

<P>
SLUMP CONTINUES FOR THE REDS, 12-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This may be the first time in major league history that a court order has 
enabled a manager to keep his job. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, the collapse of the Cincinnati Reds might have 
brought about the firing of Manager Pete Rose. Even before Rose went to court 
to battle Commissioner Bart Giamatti, there were reports that Red owner Marge 
Schott was ready to make a change. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how long the Reds' current slump continues, baseball cannot take 
Rose's job away at least until the court makes a decision on the Rose case. 
</P>
<P>
And, make no mistake about it, the Reds have collapsed. It started with a 
series of injuries, but now they can't make routine plays. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fitzgerald hit two home runs and drove in five runs Sunday at Montreal to 
lead the streaking Expos to a 12-4 victory over the Reds. It was the eighth 
consecutive defeat for the Reds and their 12th in the last 13 games. From a 
team challenging for the pennant in the National League West a short time ago, 
they have become a club diving toward the cellar. 
</P>
<P>
The losing streak is their longest since they lost nine early in the 1986 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Expos, the Reds took a 2-0 lead on a home run by Ken Griffey in the 
first inning, but Danny Jackson (6-11), a 23-game winner last year, couldn't 
make it hold up through the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Martinez was not especially impressive, but he lasted five innings and 
won his 10th in a row. He is 11-1 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
In an understatement, Rose told the Associated Press he had a confused team. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of all these injuries," he said, "the players' roles have changed 
drastically. I'm the only one whose role hasn't changed. What do you do about 
it? Maybe you guys can tell me." 
</P>
<P>
Rose neglected to say that usually in such confused situations, it is the 
manager who departs. 
</P>
<P>
The four-game sweep enabled the Expos to keep ahead of their challengers in the 
East. Although the New York Mets won their sixth in a row, the Expos have a 
three-game lead. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 9, San Francisco 5 -- Now that the Cubs are learning how to win at 
Wrigley Field, they not only have remained in the race in the East, they have 
tightened up the race in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Grace and Andre Dawson each drove in three runs at Chicago, the Cubs 
improved their record at home to 26-23 with their third win in their last four 
games, and the Giants' lead over Houston dropped to 1 1/2 games. The Cubs are 
only 3 1/2 games behind the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Grace, who extended his hitting streak to 13 games, had a double and a single. 
Dawson, who returned Friday after missing five games with knee problems, hit a 
three-run home run to break it open in the sixth inning. In the last two games, 
he has a triple and two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't hit well, we didn't pitch well and we didn't catch well in the 
series," Giant Manager Roger Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' 34-15 record is the best of any major league team at home, but they 
are 24-25 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 3, Philadelphia 2 -- The Astros' four-game sweep over the Phillies at 
Houston was tempered by the loss of hitting star Glenn Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis bruised his foot on a foul tip earlier and limped off in the seventh 
inning after drawing a walk. 
</P>
<P>
The bright spots were another strong five innings from Bob Forsch (3-3) and a 
circus catch by left fielder Billy Hatcher to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies had two on and two out in the ninth when Len Dykstra hit a fly 
ball to short left off Larry Andersen. Hatcher dived, rolled over and came up 
holding the ball. Despite the protest of the Phillies, rookie umpire Charlie 
Rehliford ruled it was a game-ending catch. 
</P>
<P>
New York 7, Atlanta 2 -- The Mets' sixth consecutive victory matched their 
longest winning streak of the season. 
</P>
<P>
David Cone (8-5) had an easy time after the Mets scored six times in the first 
inning. Cone lasted 6 2/3 innings to improve his record at home to 6-0. He is 
unbeaten in 10 starts since June 5. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough when you look up and see Montreal winning," Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, San Diego 2 -- Jose Oquendo extended his hitting streak to 21 
games with a fifth-inning double, but it was Willie McGee and Milt Thompson who 
keyed the Cardinals' attack. 
</P>
<P>
McGee drove in two runs and Thompson had three hits to help the Cardinals sweep 
the four-game series at San Diego. DAN HAFNER

<P>
After sending the leaders of the American League East into a tailspin, it 
appears the Oakland Athletics are ready to take on the leaders of the West. 
</P>
<P>
The injury problem is a thing of the past as the Athletics, .002 percentage 
points behind the amazing Angels, take on their downstate rivals in a 
three-game series beginning tonight at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Slugger Jose Canseco, who said he was "fatigued" Saturday night, hit a two-run 
home run and bullpen ace Dennis Eckersley pitched another perfect inning Sunday 
at Oakland as the Athletics completed a four-game sweep of the Baltimore 
Orioles with a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco hit 42 home runs, drove in 124 runs and stole 40 bases when he was 
healthy last season. He has played in only nine games this season, missing the 
first 86 with a broken wrist. He says he is only about 60 to 70% healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Tell it to Jeff Ballard. In the fourth inning, after a walk to Lance 
Blankenship, Canseco hit a 479-foot home run. It was his fifth home run in 31 
at-bats this season. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came up, I was thinking to myself this guy's luck is going to run out," 
Canseco said. "I've got to hit one where they can't catch it." 
</P>
<P>
For Eckersley, who missed almost two months with a shoulder injury, it marked 
the first time he pitched in back-to-back games. In all five outings he has 
been perfect. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth loss in a row for the Orioles, who were showing signs of 
having pitching and run-scoring problems before they ran afoul of the defending 
league champions. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 17, Kansas City 5 -- People who weren't even around before this month 
are leading the Indians' drive into contention in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers Dion James, Joey Belle and Brad Komminsk combined for 13 runs batted 
in at Kansas City to lead the rout that brought the Indians within six games of 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
James, acquired from Atlanta July 2, was 4 for 5, including a home run, and 
drove in five runs. Belle, brought up from Double A ball on July 15, was 2 for 
3 and drove in four. Komminsk came up from Triple A and first appeared July 1. 
He was only 2 for 5, but he homered and drove in four runs. 
</P>
<P>
In 15 games, James is 22 for 59 (.372), has scored 10 runs, driven in 11 and 
hit two home runs. In 17 games, Komminsk is 18 for 56 (.321), has scored eight 
runs, driven in 19 and hit four home runs. Belle, the only young prospect in 
the trio, has played in just nine games. He is 10 for 35 (.287), has scored six 
runs, driven in nine runs and hit one home run. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 5, New York 4 -- Rafael Palmiero scored the winning run on Jesse 
Barfield's 10th-inning throwing error as the Rangers rallied to beat the 
Yankees at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the sixth in a row for the Yankees, while Texas has won six of 
seven, including a four-game sweep of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
New York's Chuck Cary had a 4-0 lead and was one out away from a one-hit 
shutout when Scott Fletcher doubled home Rick Leach, who had walked. Julio 
Franco followed with a run-scoring single and Ruben Sierra homered to tie the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Witt (9-8) pitched a four-hitter for the Rangers, striking out 11. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 8, Chicago 2 -- The streak has come to an end for the White Sox, but the 
optimism is back. 
</P>
<P>
Fire-balling Roger Clemens (11-7) checked the hot hitting White Sox at Boston 
and the spurt stopped at eight in a row. The White Sox had not lost since 
before the All-Star game but Clemens stifled them for seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Kutcher, getting a chance to play because Dwight Evans is ailing, drove 
in four runs with his first home run and a single. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 4, Minnesota 1 -- Frank Viola had his home run ball working at 
Milwaukee and the Brewers hammered him into submission. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Brock and Glenn Braggs hit consecutive home runs in the fourth inning to 
hand Viola his 11th defeat. Rob Deer hit his 24th and Robin Yount also homered. 
In his previous 96 innings, Viola had given up only three home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 5, Toronto 2 -- Trying to beat Randy Johnson and continue their surge 
into contention in the East proved too tall an order for the Blue Jays at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-10 left-hander from USC struck out a career high 12 and pitched a 
five-hitter to improve his record to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays, after splitting the four-game series, trail Baltimore by six 
games. DAN HAFNER

NEW HALL OF FAMERS PUT DADS ON PEDESTAL;

BENCH, SCHOENDIENST, YASTRZEMSKI SAY ROAD TO BASEBALL GREATNESS STARTED AT HOME

<P>
Baseball, in its most simple form, is a parent-and-child game. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Bench, Red Schoendienst and Carl Yastrzemski, the newest members of 
baseball's Hall of Fame, reminded us of that again Sunday as they explained why 
they were enshrined in this 50-year-old pantheon that's only a fungo shot from 
the lake that James Fenimore Cooper called Glimmerglass. 
</P>
<P>
Three players from humble upbringings made it to Cooperstown, Bench from the 
red-rock canyons of Oklahoma, Yastrzemski from depression-ridden Long Island, 
N.Y., and Schoendienst from the coal-mining country of Middle America. 
</P>
<P>
They opened the doors to the Hall of Fame by hitting, catching and throwing the 
baseball better than almost anybody, using the inspiration from their fathers 
for tailwind. The parental models were important, because along the way 
Schoendienst suffered from tuberculosis, Bench underwent surgery to remove a 
lesion on his lung and Yastrzemski, besides being physically unimpressive at 
5-feet-11 and 180 pounds, had to contend with an abstract albatross, the ghost 
of Ted Williams at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
Before a crowd estimated at 20,000 on a hot, humid day that had to remind 
Schoendienst of St. Louis and Bench of Cincinnati in the summertime, the 201st, 
202nd and 203rd members of the hall made their acceptance speeches Sunday, 
sharing a platform in front of the Hall of Fame Library with 26 previously 
enshrined stars who found their way back to this picturesque village in central 
New York state. 
</P>
<P>
Also inducted was member No. 204 -- Al Barlick, who proved to be the most 
emotional of all, tears flowing and his voice cracking. "If many pleasant 
memories have anything to do with success, then I must be the most successful 
guy in the world," Barlick said. 
</P>
<P>
Bench recalled his formative years in Binger, Okla. -- population 660 -- when 
his father, the former catcher said, could hit a ball farther than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit one into a corn field beyond the diamond, and we never did find the 
ball," Bench said. "As far as I'm concerned, he was the greatest home-run 
hitter, and the greatest player, there ever was, and I learned how to play from 
my dad." 
</P>
<P>
Schoendienst hitched a ride on a milk truck from Germantown, Ill., to St. Louis 
for a tryout that led to a contract with the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage to growing up in Germantown," the ex-second baseman said, "was 
that you could find a baseball game every day. I'd play with my brothers and my 
father would join in when he came home from the coal fields. Somehow, my mother 
put up with all this baseball, but that's the way I got started." 
</P>
<P>
Yastrzemski said that his father was good enough to make the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the talent and the dedication," the former Red Sox left fielder said. 
"But it was during the Depression, and he had the responsibility of raising the 
children. If ever there was proof that somebody could make the sacrifices to 
help others, it's my dad." 
</P>
<P>
Bench and Yastrzemski both introduced their fathers Sunday. Schoendienst's 
father is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Bench and Yastrzemski sailed into the Hall of Fame the first year they were 
eligible. Schoendienst, 66, who batted .289 and set numerous fielding records 
besides managing the Cardinals to two pennants, was picked by a veterans' 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Bench, 41, will be remembered as perhaps the most complete catcher to play the 
position. He hit for power -- 389 homers, 1,376 runs batted in -- and also ran 
the game from behind the plate, directing pitchers and fielders, and throwing 
out runners with a rifle arm. 
</P>
<P>
Yastrzemski, who will be 50 on Aug. 22, played 23 seasons in Boston, hitting 
452 homers and driving in 1,844 runs. As a rookie in 1961, however, it appeared 
as though the pressure of replacing Ted Williams in left field was going 
consume him. Williams, elected to Cooperstown in 1966, had a career average of 
.344 with 521 homers. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred to break in quietly," Yastrzemski said after the 
induction ceremonies, "but that winter they were already putting my picture on 
magazine covers and saying that I was the next Ted Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"That almost demolished me. When I'd get a hit, it wasn't good enough. When I'd 
get a double, that wasn't good enough. They wanted me to hit home runs, like 
Ted did. But at that time, I wasn't a home-run hitter, I was a spray hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Yastrzemski was hitting about .220 midway through the season, but then two 
things happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I woke up one day and told myself that I wasn't going to try to be Ted 
Williams anymore, I was just going to be Carl Yastrzemski." 
</P>
<P>
Yastrzemski also went to Tom Yawkey, the owner of the Red Sox, with a request. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to get Ted Williams to come to Boston and help me," Yastrzemski said. 
"He was fishing somewhere in New Brunswick, but he flew in to town and worked 
with me for a couple of days. I batted over .300 the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who'll be 71 next month, was here Sunday. One of his nicknames when 
he played was "The Sport Shirt," and on Sunday he was the only former player on 
the platform not wearing a necktie. 
</P>
<P>
In spring training before the 1969 season, as Bench prepared for his second 
full season with the Reds, they played an exhibition game in Pompano Beach, 
Fla., against the Washington Senators, who were managed by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Bench sent a sportswriter over to Williams with a baseball to be autographed, 
and the ball came back with this inscription: "To Johnny Bench, a future Hall 
of Famer." 
</P>
<P>
After his induction, Bench talked about Pete Rose, the manager of the Reds and 
his former teammate, who is in jeopardy of having his career shortened or ended 
because of alleged betting on games. The annual Hall of Fame exhibition today 
matches the Reds against the Red Sox, but Rose isn't accompanying the team 
here, saying he didn't want to detract from Bench's enshrinement and didn't 
want the day to turn into a "media circus." 
</P>
<P>
When Bart Giamatti, the commissioner of baseball, was introduced Sunday, there 
was a small chorus of boos from several hundred Cincinnati fans in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope things work themselves out, but it should be whatever is best for 
baseball," Bench said. "I can't take sides in this. I just want baseball to 
come out a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is always a winner in Cooperstown, a town that is an ode to antiquity. 
Only about 2,300 people live here, there is no movie theater, one traffic 
light, and the first escalator hit town when the Hall of Fame opened a ritzy 
new wing in honor of the museum's golden anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
Small children and grownups masquerading as kids paraded up and down Main 
Street all weekend, looking for autographs at the Hall of Fame, ringing the 
registers at the memorabilia and souvenir shops and cramming their way into the 
limited number of restaurants and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
For $40, a collector could buy a cap worn by an unnamed member of the St. Louis 
Browns in 1909. One of the big-ticket items was a $395 bat autographed by Hall 
of Famers Henry Aaron and Eddie Mathews, and there was even a $100 price tag on 
"Wonderboy," a replica of the bat used by Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) in the 
movie version of "The Natural." 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon Sunday, however, the shops, hotels and restaurants were 
virtually empty, because virtually everyone was at Cooper Park for the 
inductions. Eight minutes before the ceremonies started, the crowd began 
singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." It was another perfect touch for a 
perfect afternoon in Cooperstown.

YEARS OF GREATNESS, PLUS 6 MONTHS TO BE BRONZED

Susan Wagner isn't a baseball fan, but each year she sculpts the memorable 
visages that represent permanence in baseball history: the Hall of Fame 
plaques. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I get a chill thinking about people coming up to Cooperstown to look 
at them," says Wagner, who has never seen her work displayed in the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner does her work for Pittsburgh-based Matthews International Corp., maker 
of the plaques since 1984. Each plaque costs the Hall about $1,100. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner's work starts early each year, shortly after the new inductees are 
elected. Aided by photos of Johnny Bench, Carl Yastrzemski, Red Schoendienst 
and umpire Al Barlick, Wagner sculpted their likenesses with oil-based clay. 
</P>
<P>
"I get the basic form and sculpt it in bas-relief," she says of the form of 
sculpture that creates an image raised slightly from the surface. "The photos 
are pretty good, though I'd really like the players to model for me." 
</P>
<P>
When Wagner finishes, Hall of Fame director Howard Talbot and curator Ted 
Spencer review the work and sometimes request changes. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews uses a sand-casting system to turn Wagner's clay patterns into bronze 
plaques. Each pattern is placed in a steel frame. Chemically treated sand is 
then hand molded around the pattern, so that a new impression is made in the 
sand. When the sand hardens, it creates a new sand mold into which molten 
bronze is poured. Once the bronze cools, the plaque is buffed, cleaned and 
highlighted. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time we get Susan's models, the process takes six weeks," said Joe 
Gabig, manager of architectural sales for Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
The other element of each plaque, the complement to the bronze image, is the 
inscription, written each year by Bill Guilfoile, the Hall's associate 
director. "I try to limit what I write to 60 or 70 words because anything too 
lengthy keeps people from reading it," Guilfoile said

PARTY CHEERS VOLUMINOUS LOOK AT DIXIE

Around the courthouse square that inspired the novels of native son William 
Faulkner, this university town threw the oddest sort of weekend literary and 
academic street party. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the publication of the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture. Ten 
years in the making, the book was a project of the Center for the Study of 
Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bluegrass and Gumbo 
</P>
<P>
While a bluegrass band played and people ate gumbo, greens and even 
black-eyed-pea pate, the 1,656-page encyclopedia was hailed as the most 
complete and unusual compendium ever written on the best and the worst of 
Southern culture. The work of a team of editors and 800 scholars and writers, 
including "Roots" author Alex Haley who wrote the volume's foreword, the book 
puts together essays and entries dealing with everything from lynchings to mule 
trading, from nuclear pollution to basket making and the blues. 
</P>
<P>
"This encyclopedia is going to be a torch to light paths in the future," 
William Ferris, one of the book's co-editors and director of the university's 
culture center, proclaimed to the hundreds gathered in the street Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the late-afternoon humidity, audience members cooled themselves with 
yellow, funeral home-style hand fans as they listened to Ferris' thoughtful 
remarks, which were sharply contrasted by his outfit, best described as a la 
Elvis and Southern tacky. The silky black jumpsuit with white fringe and tiny 
appliqued mirrors had its zippered front open nearly to the navel. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mississippi-bred, Yale-educated Ferris seemed to embody the spirit of 
the book, which dozens of people lugged under their arms after buying them in a 
local bookstore, Square Books. 
</P>
<P>
Bookstore proprietor Richard Howorth organized the "encyloparty" that included 
a Guinness World Book of Records-type of book signing. As many as 50 
contributors and editors sat outside at tables. They signed inscriptions for 
the scores of encyclopedia buyers who had traveled from throughout the South 
and patiently waited in line for hours, straining under the weight of their 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"If you carry this book around, you will not only grow in knowledge but in your 
physical fitness," University of Mississippi Chancellor Gerald Turner told the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Square Books, a sign promoted the 8-pound plus, $50 book this way: "Only 
$5.98 per lb. Same as catfish fillets." 
</P>
<P>
In all seriousness, though, Howorth said: "This is the most important thing the 
university has done in the last 10 years, in terms of measurable academic 
achievement. Plus it's truly a fabulous book." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Howorth said he was amazed that he sold 290 copies during the 
three-hour signing. 
</P>
<P>
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Press published the book and 
though the official release date is September, this month the volume has begun 
appearing in bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
In many respects the party, which lasted well into the night with three bands 
playing blues, "white-trash rock" and Cajun zydeco at clubs on the square, 
reflected the encyclopedia's scope of serious to fanciful. 
</P>
<P>
During the signing, four graduate students were wreathed head-to-toe in leafy, 
green kudzu, the erosion-control vine rumored to have engulfed cows and cars 
wholesale in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Oxford writer Larry Brown, wearing a toy pistol in his jeans' waistband and 
with his shirt totally unbuttoned, came as "The Misfit," a Flannery O'Connor 
fictional character. 
</P>
<P>
But nationally known writer Barry Hannah, who teaches at the university, backed 
down on his promise to come dressed as Mississippi's grand dame of literature, 
Eudora Welty, who did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Rule Burdine, mayor of nearby Taylor (pop. 200), did wear a curly blond 
wig and an orange lace dress with a low-cut bodice for her Dolly Parton look. 
And one local lawyer dressed as the landmark desegregation case, Brown v. Board 
of Education. A huge, V-shaped piece of brown cardboard covered him and 
attached was a piece of wood inscribed with: "of education." 
</P>
<P>
As book buyers made their way through the line, contributors gave them 
samplings. "You can use raw okra to make a Halloween mask," New Orleans writer 
Carolyn Kolb told people. "Just stick it directly on your forehead and nose. 
It'll hold." 
</P>
<P>
Contributor Jack Bass startled one man by telling about his entry: the 
Orangeburg, S.C., Massacre. Two years before the 1970 tragedy at Kent State 
University where four white students were slain, a lesser-known but similar 
killing occurred when state highway patrolmen killed three black students at 
South Carolina State College. 
</P>
<P>
With the sweep of his hand, University of Tennessee historian James C. Cobb, a 
major consultant for the book, gestured toward 40 to 50 people in line. "This 
may be a Bible for the converted, a book of cultural self-reinforcement for 
Southerners." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the project represents "an attempt to assert a cultural identity 
apart from one of just backwardness. 
</P>
<P>
"Was Southern religion, Southern folk culture, Southern music distinct enough 
to say that the South was really different?" he asked. "Or was it superfluous 
to the fact that the South stood apart because it was the most racist, most 
violent, most ignorant, most impoverished part of the country?" 
</P>
<P>
Co-editor Charles Wilson said the book exhaustively proves that the South is 
distinct in its triumphs and tragedies. The book's main scholarly achievement, 
he said, rests with its detailing the contributions of Southern blacks in the 
South and throughout the world. And, he said, "The book looks at Southern 
culture as a creation of both whites and blacks." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he said, it deals with other ethnic groups and their 
cross-cultural elements, such as kosher grits. 
</P>
<P>
One contributor discovered new frontiers in his own area of food expertise: Goo 
Goo Clusters, the caramel, marshmallow, peanuts and chocolate treat. Tom 
Rankin, a folklorist from Mississippi's Delta State University, said he signed 
the book of one woman who spun this tale: Her late husband, because of an 
ailment, had been under doctor's orders not to eat Goo Goo Clusters. After he 
died recently, the maid cleaned under his death bed. There she discovered the 
floor littered with Goo Goo wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
The night before the book signing, writer Willie Morris in an interview spoke 
of why he felt all this focusing on the South was not just self-indulgent navel 
gazing. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, one of the 250 individuals whose biographies are in the book, said, "It 
is not a regional book per se. It's a national book because the South is 
America writ large." 
</P>
<P>
Morris -- a Mississippi-born writer-in-residence at the university, a novelist 
and a former chief editor of Harper's magazine -- added: "There's something in 
the past of the South that can instruct the nation. The South possesses a sense 
of tragedy, guilt and failure and, at the same time, nobility and guts and 
courage. These are lessons for the rest of America. But I just don't know if 
America cares about this anymore."

TIMES SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY BOOK PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Johnson, publisher and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Times, 
has announced that the newspaper will award a science and technology prize, 
beginning in fall, 1989, as part of its annual Book Prize program. 
</P>
<P>
The science and technology prize joins existing awards in fiction, poetry, 
history, biography and current interest, as well as the Robert Kirsch Award for 
a body of work by a writer living in or writing about the American West. The 
Times Book Prizes have been awarded since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"This new award adds an important new dimension to our annual Book Prizes," 
Johnson said. "Science and technology have such a direct impact on our lives, 
more so than ever before. This state, for instance, is home to a score of 
science Nobel Prize winners and to major centers of technological and medical 
research. Our prize is, in a way, an acknowledgement of the importance of 
science to our readers." 
</P>
<P>
The new book prize is intended for works that are written for general 
audiences, according to Times Book Editor Jack Miles. He noted that the award 
relates directly to California's pre-eminence in scientific and technological 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"More important, it is an attempt to foster the further growth of scientific 
research, which depends upon a public consensus on its importance," Miles 
added. "Even the most serious science begins with popular science. It begins 
when a parent gives a child a favorite book about nature. It begins when a 
thoughtful librarian suggests the book that initiates a lifelong adventure. 
These are the books, and the habits, that we hope our new prize will promote." 
</P>
<P>
The Times Book Prize winners each receive a cash prize of $1,000. Nominations 
are solicited every year from 100 Times book reviewers. Finalists and winners 
are chosen by committees of three judges per category, all of whom are 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Book Prize winners will be announced in late September. The prizes 
will be presented in a ceremony at The Times in early November.

EX-BROKERAGE CHIEF, BANNED FROM INDUSTRY, USES RESTLESS ENERGY IN JUNIOR GOLF

<P>
Boyd L. Jefferies can't stand the possibility of having time on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
The founder and former chairman of the Los Angeles-based brokerage Jefferies 
&amp; Co. used to plant himself at the firm's trading desk at 2:30 a.m. and 
work straight through until 6 p.m. Now, banned from the firm and the securities 
industry, and living part of the year in this relaxed resort community high in 
the Rockies, Jefferies still compulsively gets out of bed at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
He tries to create for himself a schedule as rigorous and demanding as when he 
was one of the nation's most powerful traders of big blocks of stock and a 
pivotal figure in corporate raids. But in Aspen this hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies, 58, was sentenced July 6 to five years of probation and fined 
$250,000 for the two securities fraud counts to which he pleaded guilty in 
1987. He says he expected, and prepared himself emotionally, to go to jail. But 
the judge, recognizing his extensive cooperation with prosecutors and 
concluding that Jefferies is "essentially a good man," let him remain free. He 
still hopes, he says, to return eventually to the company -- something the 
government may allow him to do when five years have elapsed from his guilty 
plea. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the feverish energy and organizational skill of the man who 
built a nationally prominent brokerage firm are being concentrated instead on 
the Aspen Junior Golf program. He has thrown himself into the free golf program 
for youngsters with a zeal that has astonished the local residents. Arriving in 
predawn hours to hand-water a new putting green or mow the junior driving range 
that he built himself, Jefferies has increased the number of children 
participating in the program by more than 400%, arranged to bus in kids free 
from a less prosperous community down the valley and organized national 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
He devotes himself as well to a scholarship program for the children of 
Jefferies &amp; Co. employees and is founding an athletics program for children 
in La Quinta, a low-income, predominantly Mexican-American community near Palm 
Springs. He has several personal business interests and continues to commute to 
New York to meet with prosecutors and testify in securities fraud trials. But 
this isn't enough to fill up his days. 
</P>
<P>
Seizing the occasion of a reporter's visit, he hastily plans a dinner party at 
a restaurant -- for 59 guests. At 5:30 a.m., hours before he is to meet the 
reporter for breakfast, Jefferies can't resist picking up the telephone and 
awakening a few invitees who hadn't yet responded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used to Early Calls 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to leave things hanging," he explains later. 
</P>
<P>
The recipients of those phone calls were comparatively lucky. James P. Linn, 
Jefferies' attorney in Oklahoma City, says he has almost gotten used to the 
daily call from his client at 4:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies, despite his restlessness, seems in good spirits these days. He and 
his wife, Sharon, say they are surprised and enormously relieved that he isn't 
on his way to jail. In frank interviews over two days, Jefferies alternates 
between being contrite about his illegal actions and wishing that he had fought 
the charges instead of pleading guilty. He has a few words of criticism for the 
current top executives of Jefferies &amp; Co., who were picked by him. And, 
even though he got probation, he bridles at suggestions that he got off easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Let anyone who says that trade places with me for the last three years," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies' world unraveled on Nov. 19, 1986, the day he received a subpoena 
from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The federal government had begun 
prosecuting former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, suspected of making at 
least $50 million from insider trading. Boesky, in turn, had implicated 
Jefferies. Jefferies had agreed to "park" stock for Boesky, holding it for him 
without disclosing its true ownership, then returning it to him without profit 
or loss. 
</P>
<P>
After agreeing to plead guilty to two counts and cooperate with the 
government's continuing investigation of illegal practices on Wall Street, 
Jefferies agreed to sever his ties to the firm and be banned from the industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Rough Period 
</P>
<P>
This, his wife says, precipitated a depression from which he is only now 
recovering. "He really had lost any semblance of self-esteem," she says. 
</P>
<P>
He has been cut off by friends and suffered the stigma of testifying against 
former friends and clients. He has been raked over the coals by defense lawyers 
during repeated cross-examinations. Even more painful, though, has been the 
forced separation from what for 25 years had been the consuming passion of his 
life: the trading desk at Jefferies &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
His reputation for reliability -- and, especially, confidentiality -- and his 
knack for finding willing buyers or sellers on short notice earned him the 
confidence of the major players when the corporate takeover game flourished in 
the early 1980s. Jefferies pulled off feats of trading machismo that still are 
remembered with awe on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon, who used to get up with him at 1:30 a.m. to make him breakfast and pack 
a lunch, says he was so committed to pleasing clients that he brought different 
ones home with him for dinner almost every night. When they got married 17 
years ago (she is his second wife), a client and his fiancee accompanied them 
on their honeymoon trip to Monte Carlo. But Jefferies' dedication to making 
clients happy also proved his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
When they began asking him to bend the rules, he did. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies has admitted that illegally hiding the ownership of blocks of stock 
for clients, including Boesky and former Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian, 
and also manipulating the price of certain stocks when asked to do so by 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feels Healthier 
</P>
<P>
Now, cut off from his Jefferies &amp; Co. headquarters on the 33rd floor of the 
Union Bank building in downtown Los Angeles, Jefferies conducts his limited 
personal business in a small suite of offices above a bicycle rental shop in 
Aspen. He is dressed in the relaxed attire appropriate to a resort town -- a 
T-shirt, Windbreaker, jeans and sneakers. But his restlessness is betrayed by 
his incessant smoking of Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes, several packs a day, 
and by his frequent jotting down of notes of things to do on yellow legal pads, 
which he is seldom without. 
</P>
<P>
He lauds the opportunity that he now has to spend much of the day outdoors. He 
says he feels healthier and more well-rounded than when he was working. But he 
confides that he never missed the outdoors during the more than two decades 
when he spent 15 hours a day at the trading desk. "Working in the brokerage 
business was so darned exciting for me and such a turn-on that God, no, I 
didn't miss being outside." 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies states bluntly that being cut off from his life's blood at times 
makes him regret his decision to plead guilty. "If I had it to do over, I would 
have fought the thing," he says. But he quickly adds that "it really would have 
been messy for the company. . . . I just think it would have destroyed the 
company if I didn't take the rap." 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies says his current lawyer, Linn, has persuaded him that he could have 
beaten the charges if he had gone to trial. Jefferies insists, however, that he 
is ashamed of what he did. He believes his crimes were relatively minor ones 
but admits that "we were doing a lot of wrong things." He said they easily 
could have led to something even more serious if he hadn't been caught. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you break the rules, the next time somebody asks you to break the rules 
it is much easier," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expected Slap on the Wrist 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies adds that he was aware that some of his employees also were 
accommodating clients by violating the securities laws. "We all might have put 
the company out of business and ruined the lives of 400 people (who worked 
there) and their families." 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies says he knew at the time that he was breaking the law. But given how 
such violations had been handled in the past by the SEC and the Justice 
Department, he believed that the worst he would get if caught was a slap on the 
wrist. The U.S. Attorney in Manhattan confirmed in court that when the charges 
were filed against Jefferies, no one in the country had ever been prosecuted 
criminally for "parking" stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies is rankled when people compare what he did to what Boesky did. He is 
especially irritated whenever a newspaper or TV news report states -- 
erroneously -- that he was accused of insider trading. Referring to Boesky, who 
had carried suitcases filled with cash to pay off investment bankers for tips 
on pending corporate takeovers, Jefferies says: "I think what Ivan did was 
despicable." 
</P>
<P>
While some of this might sound self-serving, U.S. District Judge Morris E. 
Lasker, who sentenced Jefferies, agreed that there was an essential difference 
between his crimes and Boesky's. In passing sentence, Lasker noted that 
Jefferies was never accused of insider trading and that his transgressions, 
mainly committed to keep or win clients, didn't result in any significant 
personal profit. It was Judge Lasker who in 1987 sentenced Boesky to three 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies is used to flinging himself into whatever task is at hand, and he 
didn't shrink when it came to cooperating with federal investigators. Appearing 
in person at the sentencing hearing to speak on Jefferies' behalf, Benito 
Romano, the acting U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, said his office wouldn't have 
uncovered some of the violations now being prosecuted if Jefferies hadn't gone 
out of his way to point them out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turned Things Around 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies says that if he had chosen to do so, he could have fulfilled his 
agreement with prosecutors without volunteering some of the information that he 
did. "There are ways of cooperating and yet not cooperating," Jefferies says. 
But he says he grew impatient when several young, inexperienced SEC lawyers sat 
across from him with stacks of seized documents during his initial 
interrogations and betrayed from their questions that they didn't realize what 
they had. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to them, 'Let's do the reverse -- you give me the documents and in 15 
minutes I'll tell you what they mean and what to look for,' " Jefferies says. 
</P>
<P>
His information led to criminal indictments of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, 
as well as Bilzerian and Wall Street stock speculator and merger specialist 
Salim B. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the reality of what he was doing -- turning informant on the very 
people he had for years devoted himself to serving -- appeared to sink in when 
he was called for the first time as a prosecution witness. That was in January 
in the trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin. They were 
accused of hiring Jefferies &amp; Co. to manipulate the market price of Union 
Carbide stock in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies seemed acutely uncomfortable as he took the witness stand, and on the 
first day his normally ruddy complexion was tinged with green. The American 
Lawyer magazine began a piece on the case with the line "Boyd Jefferies looked 
as if he were about to throw up." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur L. Liman, GAF's defense lawyer, noted for his withering 
cross-examination of Oliver North during the televised Iran-Contra hearings, 
called Jefferies a con man in court and told jurors: "He was the supersalesman 
of Wall Street. He could sell snow to Eskimos." 
</P>
<P>
The GAF trial twice ended in mistrials and will be tried again in November. But 
his testimony led to the June 9 conviction of corporate raider Bilzerian on all 
nine counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Very Wealthy 
</P>
<P>
How does he reconcile himself to testifying against former friends and clients? 
"I look at it that these guys brought it on themselves. They asked me to do 
these things. They knew they were breaking the law when they asked me to do 
these things. I got caught. I feel sorry for them. All these guys were my 
friends. But they brought it on themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the personal reversals he's suffered, there are some, including Liman 
and other defense lawyers, who have argued that he has it relatively easy. And 
in fact, at least outwardly, his circumstances aren't uncomfortable. He 
confirms that his personal net worth is somewhat over $30 million. He and 
Sharon plan to sell their condominium overlooking the Roaring Fork River in 
Aspen and build a house on a piece of property they bought on Red Mountain. The 
land, less than an acre purchased for over $1 million, has a panoramic view of 
Aspen and Aspen Mountain. They also spend about six months of the year at a 
condominium they own on the grounds of the Vintage Country Club in Indian 
Wells, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
He dabbles in investing in real estate and start-up businesses, including a 
small firm that manufactures the "Debtman" -- a novelty item for executive 
desks that calculates the national debt every second. He no longer, however, 
trades stocks for his own account. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies says that for a couple of years after he left the firm he traded 
stock for his own account, but gave it up because he found it too frustrating 
not to be able to spend all his time trading. His investments are now handled 
by two money managers. Ernie Fyrwald, the head golf pro in Aspen and a close 
fbiend, says "a lot of people have said to me that he got a light sentence." 
But Fyrwald, noting Jefferies' forced abandonment of the securities industry, 
disagrees. "I compare it to saying to Arnold Palmer -- 'OK, buddy, you can't 
play golf for five years,' " Fyrwald says. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the idea of Jefferies atoning for his wrongdoing by spending time 
out on the golf course has generated more than a few barbed comments. But 
Jefferies these days hardly ever plays golf. He says he has played only twice 
this summer. Instead, he seems to revel in physical labor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picks Up Trash 
</P>
<P>
On a typical day, he waters and mows the new parts of the course designated for 
the junior golf program, and runs the weed trimmer. He hoists bags of grass 
seed and fertilizer, and sometimes retrieves golf balls from the junior driving 
range. He returns in the evenings to make sure sprinklers are properly set. In 
between, he meets with the staff of the program, arranges contributions of golf 
clubs and equipment, orders a new shipment of Aspen Junior Golf T-shirts, sends 
out invitations to junior golf tournaments and never, ever appears to be 
relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
Werner W. Anderson, a high school teacher who drives the school bus that brings 
kids up from the less prosperous neighboring town of Basalt, said he has often 
sat in his bus and watched Jefferies roam the parking lot picking up trash. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies goes about it with the air of a man endeavoring to expiate past sins. 
But if he is attempting to do good, why choose golf? Aspen already had 
well-established softball and soccer programs, he says. The golf program, on 
the other hand, was languishing, with only 40 participants. It now has about 
250. He asserts that by teaching the youngsters manners and responsibility on 
the course, "We are doing a darn good job of making potential citizens out of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Although he solicits contributions, he has financed much of the program 
himself, spending close to $300,000 since 1987. Jefferies reacts angrily when 
people suggest that the program mainly benefits the rich children of Aspen. 
"Sure, last year (actor) Don Johnson's kid was in the program," he says. "But 
that's one out of 200." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stung by Report 
</P>
<P>
In any event, his activities were enough to satisfy Judge Lasker, who pointedly 
refrained from sentencing him to perform any community service. Referring to 
the Aspen program, the scholarship program and the athletics program that he is 
organizing in La Quinta, Judge Lasker said: "You have been extraordinarily 
active in charitable enterprises" already. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies' dream is to return to his trading desk at Jefferies &amp; Co. How 
realistic this dream is remains to be seen. He says he felt stung in March when 
Business Week magazine ran a piece on how well the firm has been performing 
while he's gone and quoted Executive Vice President Alan D. Browning saying 
that "we're better off without him." 
</P>
<P>
Browning couldn't be reached for comment, but his secretary at the firm says he 
denies having said that about Jefferies. Frank Baxter, Jefferies &amp; Co.'s 
current chief executive, says he doesn't think the company would be better off 
without him. But pressed to elaborate, he says: "The earliest that can happen 
is in three years, and I'm just trying to get through today." 
</P>
<P>
Under his settlement agreement with the SEC, Jefferies is forbidden to have any 
business dealings with Jefferies &amp; Co. He has had to put the stock he owns 
in the company -- somewhere between 10% and 12% of its shares outstanding -- in 
a voting trust administered by a friend, James M. Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies discloses that he regrets having taken the company public in 1983. 
Had the firm remained private, he says, he could have been more generous in 
rewarding his staff, as Drexel Burnham Lambert's former junk bond chief Michael 
Milken had been with his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Jefferies says, he wouldn't mind seeing the firm bought out by a Japanese 
investment bank. He says Japanese firms haven't been very successful in 
penetrating the U.S. institutional market. "I think the company would be a 
natural for a Japanese investment banking firm," he says. "The two of us 
together could dominate the world in securities trading." 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies says, however, that he knows of no discussions under way with any 
possible buyers. Asked about the idea of being acquired by a Japanese firm, 
Baxter demurs. "I think it's a good investment for anyone," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother a Perfectionist 
</P>
<P>
When he reflects on his childhood and why he is so driven, Jefferies notes that 
he came from a relatively poor family in Redlands, Calif., and that, when he 
was little, his family didn't even have enough money to buy him a baseball 
mitt. He says he began performing odd jobs at an early age to earn money. "I 
grew up in a family that didn't have very much," he says. "I knew that if I 
wanted the better things in life -- not that I knew what they were -- I'd have 
to work my ass off for them." 
</P>
<P>
He also says his mother, a high school cafeteria worker, had a very strong 
personality and imbued him with her perfectionism. "I would mow the lawn and 
she would come out and look at it and point out all the places where I didn't 
do it just right, and she would say damn it, you're going to do it again until 
you get it right," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies' daughter, Carol, 32, who lives in New Mexico, says that despite the 
hardship her father has been through in the past few years, she believes that 
what happened was for the best. She says they hadn't spoken for over four years 
-- in part, she says, because he was difficult to get close to and had strong 
opinions about how she should lead her life. 
</P>
<P>
She said the prospect of Jefferies' sentencing led to a reconciliation a couple 
of months ago. "He used to be icy," she says. Recently, he seems warmer and 
more accepting, and they have established a close friendship. "He's a human 
being now," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies' son, Stephen, was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1981, when he 
was 28. The scholarship program Jefferies administers was established in his 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferies today continues to search for outlets for his restless energy. 
Fyrwald, the golf pro, some months ago visited Boyd and Sharon at their Indian 
Wells home and stayed overnight. He recalls being startled from sleep at 3 a.m. 
by a noise outside. He jumped out of bed and looked out the window, thinking 
that there might be an intruder. "But it was just Boyd out watering the lawn," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Sharon says "Being married to Boyd is a full-time job. It's like 
having 12 kids around." 
</P>
<P>
She says that because he wants it so much, she hopes his dream of returning to 
Jefferies &amp; Co. will come true. But she says she was afraid Boyd was going 
to kill himself from the long hours he used to put in at work, and she says she 
likes their life much better now. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see him just go back (to Jefferies &amp; Co.) and not get 
fully entrenched," she says. But is there really any chance that he will mellow 
a bit in the next three years? "I think he will," she says. "I'm going to put 
Valium in his breakfast cereal."

NEW EPA RULES SCARE OWNERS OF GAS STATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH COST OF INSURANCE FOR STORAGE TANKS MAY DRIVE MANY OUT OF BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Ron White and his wife, Betty, started their Upland gasoline business in 1963 
with the idea of building up a little equity for their retirement and a legacy 
to pass on to their children. That was before their nest egg turned into a 
financial time bomb. 
</P>
<P>
White, 60, built a successful chain of 10 "Gas Up" service stations in 
Glendora, West Covina, Azusa and other outlying areas, plus a healthy 
commercial and wholesale business. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1983, California passed a strict law regulating underground storage 
tanks that could leak and pollute ground water. White found himself facing 
costs as high as $35,000 per location to install new equipment and upgrade his 
57 tanks. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, with only a few more years to retirement, White faced more 
expenses: The Environmental Protection Agency issued regulations requiring tank 
owners or operators to buy pollution insurance or show financial responsibility 
to cover future cleanups and liability. 
</P>
<P>
White has until next year to find $1 million in pollution insurance -- at an 
annual premium of at least $1,000 per tank -- or face possible fines of $10,000 
per day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Thousands of Others 
</P>
<P>
Without help, White says he will have to shut down his business and salvage 
what he can. "Our retirement plans kind of changed," he said. "We were looking 
about five years down the road, but now five years won't get us out of this. 
We're taking it a month at a time." 
</P>
<P>
According to trade groups, White is like thousands of other small gasoline 
distributors and sellers who face financial ruin under the new EPA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
No one disputes the need to deal with the nation's aging underground tanks, 
most of which are made of untreated steel. Of the estimated 2 million tanks the 
EPA regulates, one in four could have leaks in tank walls or piping, said 
Ronald Brand, director of the EPA's office of underground storage tanks. In 
California, a Times survey last summer found that only half of the estimated 
142,000 underground tanks had been tested for leaks. 
</P>
<P>
But groups of gasoline marketers argue that the regulations unduly burden small 
businesses such as White's, hastening the trend away from independent 
marketers, threatening to cut off rural and outlying areas where they operate 
and giving a further advantage to major oil companies and their retail chains. 
</P>
<P>
"If our people go out, who does it leave? It leaves the major oil companies," 
said Jim Gigoux, executive vice president of the California Independent Oil 
Marketers Assn., a Sacramento-based trade group representing about 360 
marketers and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Companies with sufficient net worth -- $10 million to $20 million -- can insure 
themselves, the EPA said. But smaller tank owners or operators must buy 
insurance, which is both costly and difficult to find, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The dealer faced with 10-year-old tanks and soil contamination problems and 
who can't get the insurance, he's basically out of business," said Jim 
Campbell, executive director of the California Service Station &amp; Automotive 
Repair Assn., a trade group based in Concord, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Industry groups are lobbying heavily for a proposed state law that would assess 
a fee of $200 on each underground storage tank to create a trust fund to help 
tank owners and operators meet EPA financial responsibility requirements. More 
than 30 other states have already created such funds. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed a similar measure last year. A new version of the 
law sponsored by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benecia) has already passed the state 
Senate. Last week, a heavily amended version of the bill moved out of the 
Assembly's environmental and toxics committee. After the summer recess, it goes 
to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, said Paul Donahue, a legislative aide 
to Keene. A similar Assembly bill is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
The governor has not reviewed the latest version of the bill and has not made 
up his mind about supporting it, said Kevin Brett, the governor's press 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
No one has a good measure of how many independent marketers may be hurt by the 
EPA regulations, and the main trade group has backed down on initial estimates 
that as many as 27,000 of the service stations owned by independent marketers 
in the country -- or about 18% of the nation's estimated 150,000 retail 
gasoline stations -- would close. 
</P>
<P>
That projection, drawn from a survey by the Petroleum Marketers Assn. of 
America, garnered a lot of attention when it was released in January. Since 
then, "stations are closing, but maybe not at the magnitude we were 
projecting," especially since many states have created trust funds, said Philip 
R. Chisholm, executive vice president of the PMAA, which represents about 
50,000 gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requires More Proof 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, "it's an absolute nightmare for the entire industry." 
</P>
<P>
California's pioneering underground storage tank law, passed in 1983, provided 
the model for the EPA's technical regulations. State law, which is more 
stringent than EPA regulations in some areas, requires permits for underground 
tanks, regular monitoring of tank systems for leaks, upgrading of faulty 
equipment and cleanup of spills. 
</P>
<P>
But the EPA regulations go beyond state law in requiring proof of the ability 
to pay for cleanups, contaminated ground water and any resulting damage to 
persons or property. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of fewer than 13 underground tanks have until October, 1990, to show 
proof of at least $1 million in financial responsibility. The larger the number 
of tanks, the greater the required coverage limits and the sooner the deadline 
for coverage. Owners of 101 to 999 tanks must show $2 million in coverage by 
this October. Operators with 1,000 or more tanks were supposed to have shown 
such coverage by last January. The EPA regulations became effective in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
David Atwater, who runs the gasoline distributing company founded by his 
grandfather in Stockton, said his insurance premiums climbed to $21,000 per 
site for each of his five fueling stations before he was forced to cancel the 
policies for lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
"If we kept the insurance, it would have put us in a major loss position," he 
said, adding that his company's margins are 1% to 2%. "We have spent every 
spare nickel we have already on the technical stuff, about $200,000," including 
replacing six of his nine underground tanks and upgrading monitoring and other 
equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At a station in rural Lakeport, Calif., workers discovered that routine 
overspills of gasoline had resulted in soil contamination. Although tests 
turned up no evidence of contamination of the water table by the gasoline, it 
cost Atwater's company, California Fuels, about $70,000 to remove 28 truckloads 
of soil and replace it with clean packed sand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Use as Collateral 
</P>
<P>
The problems are more serious at California Fuels' Woodbridge station, which 
the company bought from a major oil company several years ago. Inspections 
revealed contamination consistent with a spill of several thousand gallons of 
gasoline, which could be found in soil down to the water table -- about 40 feet 
deep, he said. 
</P>
<P>
California Fuels cannot get bank loans to pay for cleanups or upgrades because 
banks won't accept the land as collateral, for fear of being stuck with the 
cost of cleanups later on, he said. And because his business grosses $12 
million to $15 million a year, he said he doesn't qualify for a Small Business 
Administration loan either. 
</P>
<P>
Without state help, Atwater said, "I might last awhile longer, but there will 
not be a fourth generation in our company." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has been working with insurers and industry officials to find ways to 
ease the burden on small business, Brand said. But he added that it is unlikely 
the EPA would respond to industry demands to extend its deadlines. "We have 
stretched as far as we could on the law and phased in its requirements," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Major oil companies, whose stations have been supplanting independents over the 
years, nevertheless support efforts to bail out small businesses affected by 
the EPA regulations. "The major oil companies have always recognized there's a 
definite niche for independent jobbers (distributors) and dealers and we don't 
want to see them wiped out," said James S. White, manager of environmental 
legislation and regulation for Arco Products Co. in Los Angeles and vice 
chairman of the storage tank task force of the American Petroleum Institute, 
the principal oil industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
A state fund could be too little, too late. "We don't think a $200 fee alone at 
this point will be adequate to capitalize the program," admitted Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Are Uninsured 
</P>
<P>
The California state fund would start out with only $7 million, far below the 
amount needed for the expected flood of applications. An additional $3 million 
would go into a fund to provide loans for equipment upgrades. Tank owners would 
still have to find insurance to cover the first $50,000 of liability coverage 
on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, preliminary results from a survey conducted by the PMAA in mid-June 
show that about 60% of the distributors queried remain uninsured, primarily 
because of the high cost of premiums, said PMAA spokesman David L. Morehead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's virtually unavailable and incredibly expensive," said Jane Jachimczyk, 
senior vice president of Oilmen's Insurance Plan, which writes pollution 
insurance, and former general counsel for the PMAA. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of companies write the specialized pollution insurance. And few 
if any write policies that conform to EPA guidelines, Jachimczyk said. 
Moreover, insurance companies require tank owners to conduct initial screening, 
equipment upgrades and even cleanups, which can easily cost hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Other insurers insist that eventually more insurance companies will provide 
pollution insurance and that premiums will fall as competition increases and 
initial tank problems are uncovered and corrected. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be enough to meet the need," said Max Clay, president of the 
Planning Corp., which underwrites the Petroleum Marketers Mutual Insurance Co. 
or Petromark, a risk retention group in Reston, Va., that is one of the larger 
providers of tank pollution insurance. 
</P>
<P>
That's little consolation to Atwater. "At one point, you think you're living 
comfortably in the middle of the middle class," he said. "The next moment, 
you're living on the edge of the ledge."

<TEXT>
<P>
In a food-and-beverage-industry version of the domino theory, a high-level 
executive change at Philip Morris Cos.' General Foods division has led to 
similar changes at Kraft General Foods, as well as Pepsico Inc. and its 
Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Miles L. Marsh, who served as president of General Foods USA, will move to 
Whitman Corp. Sept. 1 as president and chief operating officer, according to 
the company. He will oversee all of Chicago-based Whitman's subsidiaries, 
including food maker Pet Inc., Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers, Hussmann Corp. and 
Midas International. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh will be succeeded at General Foods USA by Richard P. Mayer, former 
chairman and chief executive of Pepsico's Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. At the 
same time, James M. Kilts has been named president of Kraft General Foods' 
Kraft USA unit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Former Consultant 
</P>
<P>
Mayer will be replaced at Kentucky Fried Chicken by John M. Cranor III, a top 
Pepsico executive. Cranor, formerly president of Pespi-Cola East, has been 
appointed president and chief executive of Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is the 
world's second-largest quick service restaurant system, with about 8,000 
restaurants generating sales of nearly $6 billion. It was acquired by PepsiCo 
in October, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh previously served as a consultant for McKinsey &amp; Co. and later spent 
eight years with Dart &amp; Kraft in the United States and London. He was named 
president of Kraft International in 1985 and later was appointed president of 
the Operations and Technology Group of Kraft, based in suburban Glenview. 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that his presence at Whitman will strengthen the company's focus on 
consumer goods and services, the company said.

Manischewitz Extends Deadline: Manischewitz Co. said it agreed to extend until 
Aug. 4 the deadline for completing a merger of the Jersey City, N.J.-based 
kosher foods company with Levine, Tessler, Leichtman &amp; Co. of Beverly 
Hills. Manischewitz said the date was extended beyond July 31 because more time 
is needed to resolve issues necessary for the merger and to allow time for an 
amendment to its proxy statement for a shareholders meeting on the merger 
proposal.

Cray Research Inc. of the United States, the world's largest supercomputer 
maker, and Hitachi have agreed to share technology in Cray's first deal with a 
Japanese computer maker, according to media reports. 
</P>
<P>
The nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun newspaper, Japan Broadcasting Corp. and 
Kyodo News Service, all quoting unidentified "industry sources," said the two 
have agreed to exchange supercomputer hardware technology, including circuits 
for high-speed analysis of scientific information. 
</P>
<P>
New technology as yet to be patented by either company as well as existing 
technology will be shared, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi and Cray officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News Service reported that the agreement will enable Hitachi to obtain 
technology from Cray, which has more experience than Hitachi in supercomputers, 
and will allow Hitachi, which has never sold supercomputers overseas, to step 
into the U.S. and European supercomputer markets. 
</P>
<P>
The deal also helps Hitachi avoid patent troubles with the Minneapolis-based 
Cray, Asahi reported. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agreement will give Cray access to Japanese technology and help 
it expand sales in Japan by using Hitachi's marketing network, Kyodo said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a daily business newspaper, reported that Hitachi 
also made an agreement with Hewlett-Packard Co., based in Palo Alto, to share 
technology to produce sophisticated computer workstations.

The Honolulu-based airline flies between Hawaii and five West Coast points -- 
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle and Las Vegas -- as well as 
between Hawaii and Australia. The troubled airline said it expects to lose 
$13.3 million for the first six months of this year.

TRIBUTE TO SLAIN SOCIAL WORKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RACHEL ALTMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after the February stabbing death of psychiatric social worker Robbyn 
Panitch at a Los Angeles County Mental Health Clinic in Santa Monica, pianist 
Mona Golabek wrote a letter to Panitch's parents. 
</P>
<P>
"If ever you want an evening of music to celebrate her life, I would be very 
happy to participate," she offered. 
</P>
<P>
That initial overture has resulted in a free memorial concert entitled "A 
Tribute to Robbyn Sue Panitch" to be performed at 8:30 p.m. Thursday in the 
University of Judaism's Gindi Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Golabek, who never knew Panitch and says she had "no connection to her," opened 
the newspaper, saw the photo and the headline about Panitch and was "just 
extraordinarily overcome." 
</P>
<P>
Golabek was struck by the idea that Panitch, 36, was a social worker allegedly 
killed by one of her clients. A transient, David Scott Smith, 26, is awaiting 
trial in her murder. 
</P>
<P>
"She was among the rare few still existing today who hadn't lost her idealism, 
her passion, her caring for others and was really doing it, really living it," 
she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Golabek, who says she is about the same age as Panitch, decided to give musical 
expression to the tragedy of Panitch's death. She enlisted violinist Andres 
Cardenes and cellist Jeffrey Solow, musicians with whom she tours 
professionally. They will perform Arensky's Trio in A minor, Opus 32, and 
Tchaikovsky's Trio in A minor, Opus 50. 
</P>
<P>
The program also features Los Angeles Philharmonic violinist Mitchell Newman, 
Panitch's cousin. Newman will play "Blues," the second movement of Ravel's 
Violin Sonata. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbyn loved jazz," he says, "so this is fitting. It's got a certain freedom 
to it, a certain pensive quality. It's a good piece for her and for the 
program." 
</P>
<P>
The welcome will be delivered by Juvenile County Court Commissioner Michael 
Price, the Kaddish will be sung by Cantor Esther Garber Schwartz and the 
speaker will be Dr. Louis Jolyon West, head of UCLA's Neuropsychiatric 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the musical tribute, the concert's significance for some is to 
rekindle community response to her slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Says Nora Graham, a family friend and organizer of the Friends of Robbyn 
Panitch, an ad-hoc committee publicizing the memorial concert: "We wanted to 
help put her name and her tragedy before the public, because this could happen 
tomorrow in another clinic. Her parents are remarkably unvindictive and 
humanitarian in their concern for others who follow." 
</P>
<P>
Panitch's parents, Gloria and Allan Panitch, say they have been touched by the 
"outpouring of concern from both friends and strangers with regard to the 
conditions of the death and the things leading up to it." They believe that the 
concert will be "a fine opportunity to give something back to the community 
that had so strongly turned out for us and for Robbyn." 
</P>
<P>
Golabek, the winner of the People's Prize at the 1970 International Chopin 
competition and the 1980 Avery Fisher Hall Recital Prize, is planning to close 
the Panitch memorial concert with the Tchaikovsky work. It is a eulogy written 
for the composer's friend, Nicolai Rubinstein. 
</P>
<P>
"If any piece of music is going to make this audience emotional or is going to 
extraordinarily open up their hearts," Golabek says, "it would be the ending of 
the Tchaikovsky trio. There is nothing that can be played after that." 
</P>
<P>
The Panitch family has requested that the concert not take on a funereal tone, 
but Golabek notes: "We can't forget that this is a very tragic thing that 
happened, a tragic loss. The music is an amazing statement, that ending, to the 
loss. It really is a cry, a universal cry."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'NOT NECESSARILY' A LAST BASTION OF NECESSARY SATIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's Wednesday Night Live. 
</P>
<P>
It's also "Not Necessarily the News," a weekly (three times a month) series on 
HBO and a TV institution (now in its sixth year) whose fate is in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Well, junior institution. 
</P>
<P>
"NNTN" is a minor league pitcher (audience-wise) with a major league curve. 
Because it's been on cable (HBO claims an audience of 15.9 million households), 
it hasn't even approached the ratings or exposure of NBC's infinitely more 
infamous "Saturday Night Live." No one has written any books or made any TV 
movies about the cast of this series. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "NNTN" has always been one of TV's funniest shows (often more consistently 
funny than "SNL") and a rare TV venue for slashing political satire. 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether truly biting political satire is craved by American 
viewers in sufficient numbers now to keep a 10:30 p.m. half hour like "NNTN" on 
the air. Perhaps not. 
</P>
<P>
HBO reports that the show's ratings are in the "blah" range, passable but 
hardly institution-like. So, whether "NNTN" is extended past its present 
nine-episode commitment that ends Aug. 2 remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Here's hoping. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A creation of Moffitt-Lee Productions, "NNTN" is in some ways better and meaner 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
This season's "live" element and cast are new, and the format increasingly 
resembles an actual newscast, with Annabelle Gurwitch and Tom Parks as anchors. 
Most important, the show's mandate -- to deliver as many cheap shots and low 
blows as possible -- happily survives. 
</P>
<P>
Example: A takeoff on the ABC News "Person of the Week" -- substituting another 
"P" word for Person. 
</P>
<P>
As with much satire, there are as many misses as hits: Some of the humor is 
especially cheap and sophomoric. Dopey reporter Joe Guppy is dopey. And heading 
the list of good ideas that flopped were Gurwitch's "interview" with embattled 
author Salman Rushdie, and also the usually amazing Harry Shearer as former 
House Speaker Jim Wright (good impression, bad material). 
</P>
<P>
At its best, though, "NNTN" is not only fearlessly tasteless, but frightfully 
funny. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing to top its repertoire are often-hilarious "dirty tricks" interviews 
of political figures -- ranging from President Bush to members of his 
Administration -- in which "NNTN" mischievously slices its own questions and 
reactions into footage of actual interviews, changing their meaning. 
</P>
<P>
In the hands of "NNTN," for example, Secretary of State James Baker's taped 
responses to an unknown interviewer somehow became a conference with a nun 
about the conduct of Baker's son "Jimmy" at a Catholic school. In another 
episode, Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater appeared to be responding to 
Parks' question about Vice President Quayle when he said: "I think he's a 
charlatan and phony." 
</P>
<P>
You can fault "NNTN" for distorting reality, but at least its intentions are 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
The show also has a collection of acerbic political commentators, the best of 
whom has been Will Durst, who noted recently about the Bush presidency: "The 
only problem with doing nothing is, how can you tell when you're done?" 
</P>
<P>
One of the show's most inspired bits to date, meanwhile, found Gurwitch 
daydreaming as Parks delivered a nasty commentary on Bush. Suddenly she was 
Madonna, gyrating and dancing in her underwear while fawning over a Bush 
look-alike in a parody of the singer's "Like a Prayer" video. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the show's targets relate to politics. 
</P>
<P>
It was "NNTN" that broke the story on "Batman and Rainman," for example. And 
one of show's brightest elements is Richard Rosen's hard-hitting Rosen Report, 
tough, relentless and passionate, investigative journalism at its best. 
</P>
<P>
Only recently he was brutally confronting dishonest New York street vendors, 
not only those selling phony Rolex watches, but also sellers of counterfeit 
Rolodexes ("This one has no vowels"). 
</P>
<P>
Also ranging far and wide is the show's consumer advocate, Merrill Markoe, who 
looked and sounded suspiciously like writer/TV commentator/coffee spokeswoman 
Linda Ellerbee recently when she put on large eyeglasses to offer her 
credibility and services to advertisers: 
</P>
<P>
"I have access to cameras, studio time. I've got the eyeglasses, everything it 
takes to make your refreshing beverage a huge seller. And as long as I keep 
talking with this big smile on my face and a certain amount of authority, I bet 
no one notices this isn't part of a newscast." 
</P>
<P>
With HBO and MTV launching comedy channels and stand-up comics continuing to 
proliferate throughout television, the small screen is becoming America's 
electronic Catskills, a training and growing ground helping to revitalize an 
entire industry. Fine, as long as the social and political humor of an "NNTN" 
isn't killed off in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's episode is the show's 80th in a long run that deserves to be even 
longer, one that has proved "Not Necessarily the News" is necessary.

WHY THE KIROV ISN'T SCHEDULING BALANCHINE HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the Kirov Ballet is making dance history in New York by dancing recently 
acquired works by George Balanchine, Orange County and San Francisco audiences 
apparently will not see the company perform works by the seminal choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
Only New York and Washington -- of the four American cities on the current 
Kirov tour -- are scheduled to see the Leningrad company in Balanchine's 
"Scotch Symphony" and "Theme and Variations." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, scheduled here during the Aug. 18-27 run at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa are "The Sleeping Beauty," "Le Corsaire" 
and a program of mixed repertory -- none of it by the legendary "Mr. B," a 
Kirov alumnus who left the Soviet Union in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, two of the works on the mixed bill -- Petipa's "Paquita" and 
Fokine's "Chopiniana" -- were danced by the Kirov in Los Angeles on the 
company's last tour at the Shrine Auditorium in May, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco will get only the two full-length ballets. 
</P>
<P>
Why no Balanchine on the West Coast? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is . . . there's the rub. There is some question as to who made the 
decision about what the company will offer, at least in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Center president Thomas R. Kendrick said that it was Kirov artistic director 
Oleg Vinogradov: "Certainly Vinogradov determines repertory," Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Vinogradov, speaking with Times Music and Dance Critic Martin 
Bernheimer in New York, said: "They (Orange County Performing Arts Center) 
asked for the bigger productions. We thought you were sick and tired of 
Balanchine. But maybe we will do it. Sometimes there are surprises." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Kendrick said: "We wanted the company to present here what they 
feel best reflects the company and their best works and what they want to do. . 
. . It always was the Kirov's position that 'Chopiniana' and 'Paquita' and most 
of all the selected pas de deux are most reflective of what the Kirov stands 
for and is noted for, and they would offer that and we accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
"This was all decided a year or more ago," Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were interested in doing 'Sleeping Beauty' for the full run," he said. 
"We were interested in having a variety of representation from the Kirov. It 
worked out very early that they wanted to do 'Le Corsaire.' And we wanted a 
mixed-repertory program." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick added: "Balanchine may be OK if you have three weeks to show off, but 
not if you have nine days. We have elected to do three programs in nine days." 
</P>
<P>
The Kirov run in New York is 18 days. The Washington run is 11 days. The San 
Francisco run is 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Opera was not given an option regarding the mixed repertory 
programs, according to a spokeswoman. "We were offered the the two full-length 
ballets," Elizabeth Lynch said. "And we said yes." 
</P>
<P>
Balanchine was trained as a dancer at the Imperial Ballet School of the 
Maryinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg (now Leningrad). The theater was renamed 
the Kirov in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
He emigrated to the West to work with the Diaghilev Ballets Russes, and 
eventually to found, with Lincoln Kirstein, a company that became New York City 
Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, Balanchine's works were considered "decadent," ostensively 
because of their plotless, "abstract" choreography, and were virtually never 
legally performed by Soviet companies until last year. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as part of the new artistic and social openness with which the Soviet 
Union is addressing the West, Francia Russell, artistic co-director of the 
Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Suzanne Farrell, considered by many as the 
supreme Balanchine ballerina, were sent to Leningrad last fall by the 
Balanchine Trust to stage these works and to train the Kirov dancers in the 
Balanchine style.

CBS DOCTOR SERIES BACKS DOWN FROM ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE SLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Chamberlain's new series for CBS has been given both a new title and a 
new look, according to Chamberlain and his co-executive producers, Nigel and 
Carol McKeand. 
</P>
<P>
The new fall medical series, which had been announced in the spring under the 
working title "The Hawaiian," is now called "Island Son," and is one of several 
fall series -- including NBC's "Nutt House" and ABC's "Living Dolls" -- which 
are being re-tooled or undergoing some casting changes before making their 
debut in September. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, at the request of the network, "Island Son," about a heroic 
doctor (Chamberlain) practicing in Hawaii, will tone down its original bent 
toward the ancient Hawaiian traditions of holistic medicine in favor of more 
conservative medical techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain and the show's two other executive producers, Nigel and Carol 
McKeand, told journalists gathered at the Century Plaza for the TV industry's 
annual summer press tour that "Island Son" would stress less of the "mystical 
side of healing" than it did in the first scenes produced and shown to the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking it easy on that stuff for the general public," Chamberlain said. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain and the McKeands were responding to questions prompted by reports 
that CBS was dissatisfied with the original concept of the show, which was sold 
to the network with only a description of the concept and without a pilot. 
Nigel McKeand said that he and the network had come to an agreement months ago 
that the American public might be less receptive to ancient Hawaiian medical 
practices than to the antiseptic hospital techniques Chamberlain used 20 years 
ago when he portrayed Dr. Kildare. "I agreed with them, I agreed that we should 
cool it in that area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McKeand also said that the producers were still looking for an actress to 
portray Dr. Caitlin McKenna. They said they would make their decision this 
week; shooting on the series starts filming today in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain said that one of the original scenes the network found questionable 
was one in which a Hawaiian healer transferred some of the pain of childbirth 
from a woman in labor to her husband when the pain became too severe for her to 
take. Chamberlain called the practice "not uncommon" among such healers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good scene," Chamberlain said. "But I think we lost our way a little 
bit there. I don't think you can expect an audience to accept that as easily as 
we did."

PRESCHOOL TEACHERS FALL INTO AN O.C. PAY GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN O'LEARY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Child-care centers in Orange County are finding it more difficult to attract 
and keep qualified preschool teachers as salaries continue to hover near the 
minimum wage and benefits are largely non-existent, according to industry 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
"Wages and benefits are the sleeper issues that will put the brakes on day 
care," said Betsy Mathis, a child-care consultant and former head of Irvine's 
municipal child-care committee. "The joke is that it is better to take a job at 
McDonald's. It is a tremendous problem." 
</P>
<P>
According to the state's Employment Development Department, there were 3,799 
day-care workers and preschool teachers in the county in 1987. Pay for day-care 
teachers and workers ranges from $5 to $12 per hour, and many teachers with 
bachelor degrees in early childhood development are forced to work for $6 to $8 
per hour, which is $12,480 to $16,640 per year. 
</P>
<P>
"The shortage has become really critical the last two or three years," said 
Nancy Claxton, who runs the child development program of the county's 
Department of Education. "It used to be when I had a teacher opening, I might 
get 50 to 60 applications. Now I might get five applicants." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said part of the problem is the strong county economy and low 
unemployment rate. They said many choose not to enter the field because they 
know that pay is low and few positions offer benefit packages found elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the average full-time weekly pay of child-care workers nationally 
was $187, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics -- less than 
$4.68 an hour. For preschool teachers and kindergarten teachers it was $321 
(about $8 an hour), while elementary-school teachers made $481 (about $12 an 
hour) and high-school teachers made $521 (about $13 an hour). 
</P>
<P>
Benefits, such as Social Security and work breaks, rarely go beyond what is 
required by law. Health coverage is rare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subsidizing Profession Women 
</P>
<P>
Experts said child-care workers are subsidizing other professional women. "What 
it really boils down to is, one group of women is virtually forced to exploit 
another group of women," Claxton said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have young people who have prepared to work with young children and have 12 
units (of college courses) to a bachelor's (degree) who are leaving the field 
because they cannot afford to stay." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Mary Flaczinski, a teacher at the Irvine Child Development Center, 
said she especially likes to deal with infants and toddlers. But now she and 
her husband have decided that she needs a job that provides medical coverage 
for their family. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably look for a job," she said, "at a grocery store or a bank. . . . 
It is very upsetting to leave because of economic reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Even the UC Irvine child-care program -- which can afford to pay lead teachers 
$1,600 per month, a very high salary in the field, and offers unmatched 
benefits -- has had teachers leave for better-paying clerical jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
42% U.S. Turnover Rate 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Assn. for the Education of Young Children, the 
turnover rate for child-care workers is 42%. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Wollent, a spokesman for Kinder-Care -- the nation's largest profit-making 
day-care chain, which operates 18 centers in the county -- said the turnover 
rate in day care is comparable to the rate in the fast-food industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't pay much because we are trying to offer the parent the lowest 
prices," Wollent said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the shortage of qualified teachers has led to competition among 
child-care centers. This market mechanism plays havoc with the lives of young 
children, who thrive on stability, said Karen Bocard, head of child care at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Children must bond with their care-giver," she said. "If their care-giver 
changes one, two or three times in a year, then the child is not able to bond 
and is not able to feel secure in the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Unless salaries improve, there is the fear that fewer and fewer people will 
enter the child-care profession or make a long-term commitment, said Mathis, 
the former chief of Irvine's day-care panel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warmth 'Is a Gift' 
</P>
<P>
She emphasized that the quality of a day-care program is directly linked with 
the quality of its staff: "There is an amorphous quality when you walk into a 
center. You can feel the staff that relates to the kids. It's a gift . . . the 
warmth of how they speak or move the groups of children around." 
</P>
<P>
The best preschools offer children, especially 3- and 4-year-olds, a continual 
kaleidoscope of experiences difficult for parents to match at home. Child-care 
professionals continue to struggle against the idea that anyone can provide 
effective day care and that staff members are merely baby-sitters. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very difficult job," said Roberta Berns, head of the human development 
department at Saddleback College, "because it requires knowledge of child 
development, and children of the same age are not necessarily at the same point 
of development. . . . You have to keep changing your style of interaction." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Assn. for the Education of Young Children surveyed all child-care 
centers in the county in 1988 and found that 41% of teachers and directors have 
bachelor degrees. Also, 22% had graduate degrees or had done graduate work. 
Almost 70% had at least one year of college. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Next-Best Paying 
</P>
<P>
After the college-based programs, the day-care centers in the county offering 
the best salary and benefit packages are those run by the county's Department 
of Education and the Garden Grove Unified and Fullerton Unified school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Many of their teachers are members of the California Teachers Assn., which 
represents teachers in labor negotiations. "The pay is not quite equal to 
elementary teacher pay, but the benefits are equal," said Claxton, the director 
of the county's Department of Education child development program. 
</P>
<P>
A national Louis Harris poll taken in April found that 73% of Americans were 
willing to increase their taxes to pay for child care. Nine of 10 surveyed were 
concerned about day-care staff being underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
At the federal level, President Bush has proposed a child-care tax credit of up 
to $1,000 per year for low-income parents, while Democrats in Congress have 
countered with the Act for Better Child Care, the so-called "ABC Bill" that 
would provide money for salaries and training of day-care teachers and urge 
states to set standards for child-care centers. (California already has 
standards for child-care centers.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand in County to Climb 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, officials said the demand for child care is certain to 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
According to county officials, the number of children in the county is expected 
to increase by 11% in the next decade. In 1984, nearly half the children under 
5 years old in the county had working mothers, according to the Orange County 
Commission on the Status of Women. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is building facilities," said Bocard, UCI's head of child care. "But 
where is the staff going to come from?"

LAGUNA LEFT POWERLESS IN HEAT OF A SWEATY SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just two hours went by Sunday sans electricity in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a beach town. At the peak of summer. And on this sultry, sunny day, 
it was laden with thousands of sweaty beach-goers and tourists seeking refuge 
from inland heat. 
</P>
<P>
Let's forget the garden-variety power failure in which your refrigerator and 
its ice and food go lukewarm and your fan goes dead -- along with your sense of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic signals on Coast Highway were out throughout the village-like downtown 
on the worst day of the week for vehicle snarls. The result was a giant, 
snakelike parking lot backed up for miles in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
Had the Pageant of the Masters offered matinee performances, police said, 
Laguna Beach would have been a worse mess. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Police Sgt. Mike Hall said, "our power went out here, but the lights 
went out and then the generator kicked on, so we were OK. But we held over the 
whole day shift just for the traffic control." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Sheldon, a San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. spokesman, said a transformer 
apparently withered from heat at 2:40 p.m., knocking out power to about 2,400 
customers from downtown Laguna Beach north to Corona del Mar. By 5:20 p.m., 
power was restored. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, merchants had to make do. 
</P>
<P>
At Heidi's Frogen Yozurt Shoppe on Broadway, that effort lasted about 10 
minutes. By then, the cold dessert was melting to a creamy soup in Heidi's 
machines, forcing the shop to close for business at 3 p.m. -- eight hours 
early. 
</P>
<P>
"We served it melted for a while, but we're just cleaning it up now," said 
Heidi's worker Paul Townsend, 14. 
</P>
<P>
Of equal importance, Townsend added, was that "the cash registers don't open" 
during a power failure. 
</P>
<P>
But customers at the store across Coast Highway from Main Beach had been good 
natured, Townsend said. And patient. By 4:30 p.m. the power was back and the 
yogurt shop reopened. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been really busy," Townsend said, since the power went back on. 
</P>
<P>
At the oceanfront Las Brisas Restaurant, the kitchen shut down as the popular 
brunch hour closed and the early-dinner crowd began arriving, manager Fouad 
Ziady said. Stocked with plenty of ice, the bar remained open, and cold ones 
were served -- with the exception of beverages that require an electric 
blender. 
</P>
<P>
"We could still serve drinks, but our brunch is served through 3:30, and we 
lost an hour of our dinners," Ziady added. 
</P>
<P>
South a few blocks on Coast Highway, at Hotel Laguna, reservations could not be 
made for a chunk of the afternoon because the beachfront inn was without phone 
service, along with its electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Acting "like (traffic) signals," Sgt. Hall said, police officers from the day 
shift who were due to clock out at 3:45 p.m. stayed on the streets for 75 
minutes while the night shift responded to other calls in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, "it would have been mass confusion."

FAIR CLOSES AFTER SETTING ATTENDANCE RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Fair ended its record-breaking 12-day run Sunday, a day after 
setting an all-time attendance mark for a single session, fair officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've broken every attendance record during the 12-day run, with the exception 
of last Friday. But 11 records for each day out of 12 isn't too bad, is it," 
said Diane Sorensen, a fair spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, Saturday's fair attendance -- despite numerous competing 
attractions in Southern California -- was 74,891. 
</P>
<P>
Sorensen said that mark surpassed the previous record of 73,801, which was set 
on the second Friday of the 1987 run. 
</P>
<P>
As the fair headed into its last day, 490,029 visitors had passed through the 
turnstiles, compared to 435,787 for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, large crowds meant long lines for people trying to enter the fair, 
park their vehicles and enjoy the amusement rides. 
</P>
<P>
One couple, Greg and Shelly Calkins, vacationing from Grand Junction, Colo., 
said they got tired from the long walk after they left their car "in the very 
last aisle" of the fair's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
But once inside, they had a good time. Greg lofted his wife on top of his 
shoulders and, on the count of three, they were immortalized on film while 
riding a surfboard on a make-believe ocean wave. 
</P>
<P>
At $5 a photograph, vendor Peter Schworer of Huntington Beach said, this year's 
fair was extremely lucrative. "It's the best fair we've ever done," said 
Schworer, president of Mak'n Waves Inc. "We've had a combination of good 
weather and lots of people who saw our wave and had their picture taken." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Mind Waiting in Line 
</P>
<P>
Inside, thousands of people didn't mind standing in lines for popular rides and 
such nourishment as fresh-baked cinnamon rolls, fried zucchini and beer. 
</P>
<P>
Sorensen attributed the fair's large turnouts to a combination of 
entertainment, promotion and side attractions. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, Saturday's record was set with the help of country and 
Western singer Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers; a rodeo, and disc jockeys 
from radio station KLOS-FM, who transmitted live from the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"And we had several contests for the fair participants during the day. We like 
to keep them busy," Sorensen said. 
</P>
<P>
At noon Sunday, the fair was once again on a record-setting attendance pace, 
Sorensen said, with an attendance figure of 11,969 people. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night's musical entertainment attraction of the reunion of Tony Orlando 
and Dawn was expected to be standing room only. 
</P>
<P>
Sorensen did not have immediate revenue figures available. In 1988, however, 
parking and admission revenue hit an all-time high of $1.6 million. In 1987, 
the figure was $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The carnival, B &amp; B Amusements, took in $1.12 million in gross receipts in 
1988. This was also a record, up from 1987, which was $1.1 million, Sorensen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But for some, the fair's final day became a test of emotional courage. 
</P>
<P>
Heidi Gugler, 15, of Fullerton was one of hundreds of Orange County students 
who cleaned livestock pens and fed their pets all spring, fattening them up for 
sale at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
For Heidi, Sunday was the most difficult day of her young life. After raising 
"Porky," a stocky, 235-pound Duroc hog, for 6 months, she had to summon her 
courage to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really going to hate seeing him go. I sold him at auction and the last 
time I'm going to be able to see him is tonight (Sunday) at 10 p.m. They're 
going to put him in a truck and take him away," Heidi said, as she lovingly 
sprayed her pig with cool water from a squeeze bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Porky is a she, not a he, Heidi said, "but I can't call a pig a 
'her.' It doesn't sound right." 
</P>
<P>
As a young businesswoman, Heidi bought Porky through a farm program at Sunny 
Hills High School for $75 when he weighed only 50 pounds. During the months 
with Porky, she fed him, cared for him and learned a lot about farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$91 in Pig Profit 
</P>
<P>
"I sold him for $1.25 a pound and I'm going to get about $91 in profit, minus 
7%, which goes to the auctioneer," she said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
Will it be difficult to say goodby? 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, huh. My parents told me not to get too attached because I would have to 
give him up eventually. But he learned the sound of my voice and when I called 
him he recognized me and he would come to me. 
</P>
<P>
"And look," she said, bending down and giving the porker a nice scratch, "he 
just loves this." 
</P>
<P>
Porky raised his big head and snorted. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, pigs are smart too. They're smarter than rabbits, and even dogs, and 
another thing . . . ."

WOMAN IS STRUCK BY 2 CARS WHILE CROSSING COAST HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman was hit by two cars and critically injured early Sunday as she crossed 
Coast Highway in South Laguna, and police were seeking the victim's identity 
and any witnesses to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Lance Ishmael said the woman referred to by police and 
hospital officials as Jane Doe appears to be in her early to middle 20s. 
</P>
<P>
She has brown, medium-length hair, is 5 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs about 
145 pounds. She was wearing two toe rings on her left foot and a light blue 
skirt, dark blue top and yellow thongs. 
</P>
<P>
Ishmael said the woman carried no identification when she was hit at 1:33 a.m. 
near the West Street junction, where there is a Coast Highway crosswalk but no 
traffic signal. He provided the following account of the accident: 
</P>
<P>
A Ford Escort driven by a Long Beach man was traveling north on Coast Highway 
when it struck the woman, knocking her onto the hood, then into the windshield. 
The woman fell off the car into the roadway, and another driver, who did not 
see the victim, also struck her. 
</P>
<P>
Both drivers pulled over immediately and tried to get help. Neither driver had 
been drinking alcohol, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was taken by rescue helicopter to Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center in Mission Viejo, where she was reported in very critical condition with 
"major head injuries and several broken bones," Ishmael said.

BLYLEVEN TAKES ANOTHER STEP; 
</P>
<P>
HE PASSES WALTER JOHNSON ON ALL-TIME STRIKEOUT LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In keeping with the Angels' latest method of operation, their pitching held the 
Detroit Tigers in check Sunday at Anaheim Stadium. Well, at least as long as it 
took the Angels to mount yet another dramatic comeback and win in the late 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven starred in the most recent version, passing Walter Johnson on the 
all-time strikeout list. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the fifth inning, Blyleven struck out Mike Brumley for the 
3,509th strikeout of his career. Johnson finished with 3,508. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven moves to sixth on the all-time list with 3,512. Nolan Ryan, with 4,941 
strikeouts and counting, holds the record. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nice," said Blyleven, who struck out six before leaving with the score 
tied, 3-3, after seven innings. "That's a personal thing. Passing Walter 
Johnson is a thrill. When I came into the league in 1970, he was the (all-time) 
strikeout leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he got his last strikeout when I first pitched." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, 38, is a kidder. Johnson pitched for the Washington Senators from 
1907-1927. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven turned in seven solid innings, giving up three runs, eight hits and 
one walk. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert got a little tired," Manager Doug Rader said. "His game against Toronto 
(a 1-0 victory on Tuesday) was emotionally draining. He was throwing OK 
(Sunday), but we thought it was the best thing for Bert (to come out)." 
</P>
<P>
Rader turned the game over to relievers Rich Monteleone and Bob McClure. 
McClure (3-1) picked up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Although Blyleven didn't get a decision in the Angels' 5-4 victory over 
Detroit, he helped them stay close. 
</P>
<P>
And, as Johnny Ray pointed out, "Our pitching keeps us in the ballgames. If we 
can stay close, we feel like we can win." 
</P>
<P>
This time around, Wally Joyner got hit in the back by a Brad Havens' pitch with 
one out and the bases loaded in the ninth inning to bring home the winning run. 
It was the fourth consecutive victory over the Tigers in the last inning. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Blyleven pitched, he benefited from Joyner's solo home run in the 
sixth for a 1-0 victory over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting as a pitcher," Blyleven said. "You know if you keep it close 
until the seventh, eighth or ninth inning, we have a chance to win (late in the 
game)." 
</P>
<P>
And certainly, Blyleven has been aided by such strong, if last-minute, support 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
It's allowed Blyleven, who has a 10-2 record with a 2.32 earned-run average, to 
get off to the fastest start in his 19-year career. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, he was a 37-year-old who appeared to in the twilight years of a 
long, distinguished career. He had posted a 10-17 record with a 5.43 ERA with 
the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
But an off-season trade to the Angels has done wonders for him. He's living at 
his Villa Park home year-round now and playing not far from his old high 
school, Santiago in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven has helped rejuvenate the Angels and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
His ERA is the lowest in the starting rotation and second best in the American 
League behind Oakland's Mike Moore, who has a 2.12 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
He's second on the club in victories with 10, complete games (five) and in 
innings pitched (147 2/3). 
</P>
<P>
All of which has allowed him to continue to pass such all-time greats as 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Next up for Blyleven is Gaylord Perry's fifth-place standard of 3,534 
strikeouts, which he should pass in the not-too-distant future.

DIEPRAAM BEATS DOUBLES PARTNER IN SINGLES FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL PRESTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith Diepraam and Jim Parker are close in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, they play doubles together. For another, they live close to each 
other -- Parker in Houston, Diepraam in nearby Sugarland, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
And, said Diepraam: "We get along very well. We're good friends." 
</P>
<P>
Both men figured prominently in the final of the U.S. national 45 tennis 
championships Sunday at the Lindborg Racquet Club in Huntington Beach. In the 
singles title match, Diepraam, the tournament's top-seeded player, used his 
strong serve and aggressive volleying to defeat second-seeded Parker, 6-4, 4-6, 
6-2, and win $500. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in four years that Diepraam and Parker have played 
against each other, and the third time in four attempts that Diepraam, a former 
South African Davis Cup team member, has won. 
</P>
<P>
In the doubles final, Diepraam and Parker, the top-seeded team, proved too 
strong for the defending national champions, second-seeded Jim Nelson and Bob 
Duesler of Newport Beach. Diepraam and Nelson overcame a slow start for a 6-3, 
6-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Diepraam, who won the world 45-and-over hardcourt championship last year, also 
had a sluggish beginning in his singles title match as Parker took advantage of 
some erratic returns and two double faults by Diepraam to take a quick 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who broke Diepraam's serve to take a 5-3 lead in the second set, was 
up, 40-15, in the next game when Diepraam stroked a forehand down the line. 
Diepraam then caught Parker out of position with a well-aimed cross-court shot. 
</P>
<P>
After Diepraam got the advantage by scoring on a soft lob, Parker lobbed the 
ball out of bounds to give Diepraam the game that narrowed Parker's lead to 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Parker then countered with two winners off Diepraam's serve in the next game to 
force a third set. 
</P>
<P>
After the two men split the first four games of the final set, Diepraam fought 
through three deuces in the fifth game to break Parker's serve and take a 3-2 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Diepraam then broke Parker's serve once more as he won the next three games of 
the set to take the match. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to get my first serve in all the time," said Diepraam, who 
finished the match with seven aces to Parker's two. "I played relaxed 
throughout the match and forced him to make the mistakes instead of me. He sort 
of played the way I thought he would play, but he had some double faults at key 
points of the match to help me out. He didn't really do anything that I didn't 
expect him to do." 
</P>
<P>
Said Parker, who had eight double faults to Diepraam's three: "His aces and my 
double faults kind of set the tone for the match. I sort of struggled with my 
serve throughout the match, and he returned the ball so well when he had to." 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who won $300 for finishing second in the singles final, split the $500 
first prize with Diepraam for winning the doubles championship. Duesler and 
Nelson split $300 for finishing second.

BUILDING AUTO INDUSTRY TEAMS;

<P>
NEWPORT BEACH FIRM HELPS FORD, UAW JOIN 'REVOLUTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Maria L. La Ganga, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is trashed by dissident members of the United Auto Workers as a scheme to 
maintain production while hiring fewer workers. But it is working its way 
slowly and surely into U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It" is the Japanese-style "team concept" of industrial production -- a program 
in which workers function in small groups that have greater responsibility in 
the production process and quality control. And it is responsible for more than 
a third of the $7 million in annual income that the J. Henry Lyle Co. of 
Newport Beach expects to pull in this year. 
</P>
<P>
One of the team concept's side effects is that management and labor end up 
working much more closely together. Another is that job descriptions and titles 
are done away with. Both things strike fear into the hearts of workers and 
managers throughout the automotive industry. 
</P>
<P>
And that's where J. Henry (Jim) Lyle comes in. 
</P>
<P>
A soft-spoken advertising man and management consultant, Lyle was hired by the 
UAW and the Ford Motor Co. to help ease the firm and its workers into what he 
calls "the revolution." 
</P>
<P>
Lyle, 53, got his start in the automotive industry about 35 years ago when he 
worked on the assembly line at the Cadillac Motor Car Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I was putting a wire in underneath the car," he said, "and then I pounded in 
the bumper, and I did a few other things underneath the car. And I did it every 
day for eight hours a day for six months or so. It was a steady paycheck, and I 
felt good about that. I got health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
Lyle also worked a six-month stint in the late 1960s selling Fords in Royal 
Oak, Mich. He averaged 34 car sales per month on a two-day workweek. He later 
graduated to the advertising business, working automotive accounts for ad giant 
J. Walter Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
He opened his namesake company in Detroit 14 years ago as an advertising and 
market-research firm serving the automotive industry. A large part of the 
firm's work was in training sales people at more than 100 dealerships 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The company moved to Newport Beach in 1983. Three years later it branched into 
consulting with auto dealers on organizational development and strategic market 
planning. In 1988, the company was hired by the UAW and the Ford Joint Quality 
Improvement Implementation Committee to help introduce the team concept to Ford 
plants. To that end, the J. Henry Lyle Co. founded Operative Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle, who is president of both firms, recently discussed the team concept with 
Times staff writer Maria L. La Ganga. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Japanese-style team concept was in the news recently and controversially 
when the United Auto Workers had their national convention here. What is it all 
about? 
</P>
<P>
A. What is the team concept? Well, it's when you form a group and give it a 
purpose. Part of that purpose is continuous improvement within the group of 
what it produces. And to do that you have to continuously improve the 
conditions in the workplace and educate the worker. The team begins to work 
together, and members create a peer pressure that really is the reason for 
quality being constant over a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How long has it been around in the automotive industry? 
</P>
<P>
A. In the automotive plants during the Second World War, the team concept was 
prevalent in producing war products. And very successful. That would be 
probably the closest I could come to when the team concept started in the auto 
industry. But because of the conditions that existed in labor at that time, and 
the issues that both labor and the manufacturers had, they didn't pick up on 
that team concept after the war. They went back to controlled management, 
directed management, the assembly line. The team concept didn't come back to us 
until it went over to Japan and then came back. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the alternative? 
</P>
<P>
A. Control-directed management. The old assumption is that management knows 
everything, and the worker knows nothing. So management makes the decisions and 
tells the worker what to do. The team concept assumes that management and 
worker both know what to do, and that management has its prerogatives and the 
worker has his or her prerogatives. If you give the worker the ability to make 
decisions at that team's workplace, the decisions get closer to the product and 
help improve the quality. The worker gets more involved. The worker feels more 
involved. He feels more a part of, rather than left out. The general attitude 
of the work area improves, the quality of the car improves, the cost of 
production is lowered. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You make it sound like such a positive and glowing thing, but it has 
obviously engendered a lot of fear. We saw that at the UAW convention. The 
dissidents there, and other detractors, say that joint programs will do a 
variety of things, like eroding union protections, damaging the national UAW 
and costing jobs. How do you respond to that? 
</P>
<P>
A. There is some fear in change, and that's to be expected. That fear is 
manifest in a minority segment in the union of less than 10%. They say that if 
we can become better at our jobs, they'll give us more to do, and our jobs will 
become more difficult and the better we become at our jobs we'll be replaced by 
automation or robots, so we're working our way out of business. That's one way 
it's perceived. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How widespread is the use of the team concept in the automotive industry? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's only just begun. It takes time. It's a process. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The GM plant in Van Nuys has it, right? 
</P>
<P>
A. In part. The New United Motors Plant in Fremont, Calif., is probably the 
hallowed plant in participative management, the joint venture between General 
Motors and Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How is the team concept changing the relationship between union and 
management? 
</P>
<P>
A. The old control-directed management operated by telling you what to do. "We 
don't want any input from you. There is no feedback system. And that's the way 
we're going to do it. And production is No. 1. And we're the boss." The new way 
is, "We're going to work as a team. Not only on the floor are you going to work 
as a team of five or six or seven and have cross skills, but we're going to 
work as a team between management and leadership at the local level, at the 
regional level and at the national level. And we're going to work together on 
making decisions: When do we build a plant? Why do we build a plant? What kind 
of car do we make? Decisions into conception as well as engineering and 
manufacturing and even beyond manufacturing, into delivery and then service. So 
we're going to get the UAW involved in the whole process." 
</P>
<P>
Q. And the reaction to this? 
</P>
<P>
A. Management has been programmed from 50 years of directive controlled 
management. And now, you say something like participative management and they 
say, "I don't want to go to charm school. This is the way it's worked for 35 
years, the way I've worked it. And I've gone through the ranks, and I've been 
rewarded for controlling. And now you're telling me I have to do it 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
Q. So management doesn't like it and the unions don't like it. Why are they 
doing it? Economic realities? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's not that they don't like it, it is just that they are still getting 
used to it. Most do like it because both sides agree on something. They both 
have a common denominator, a vested interest. That vested interest is job 
security. Ford management is 60% less than it was five years ago. It's not only 
the worker on the floor who was laid off when the plants closed down; it was 
the management. They did a diagonal slice through their management. That put 
the fear of God into everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why did this happen? 
</P>
<P>
A. We couldn't compete on quality. That was the message driven home, clearly 
driven home. Now the worker says, "I know that I have to do this." A full 90% 
of the workers are saying, "Hey, I agree with this. I think that my job 
security is important to me. I'm going to be able to have a second car and all 
those things that job security gives you in the auto industry." In management, 
the preponderance of management believes in it too. But it's like, "You know 
that person over there that you were fighting with, like the Hatfields and the 
McCoys? Now I want you to go be their friend. I think it's in your best 
interests to do that." Well, it takes me a little while to get used to McCoy. 
And that's the process we're going through now. We're going through a 
transition and I think that its progress is really encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How is this going to change the very tangible, specific, day-to-day job of 
someone who used to work on an assembly line? We don't have a lot of auto 
workers in Orange County. How does the concept affect workers in general? 
</P>
<P>
A. First, they get up with a different attitude. The more you know about your 
job, the higher your level of skill development, the better you feel about 
yourself and the work you do. It's kind of basic. And that's what's happened to 
the worker. So the worker gets up and it's not that "Oh, my God, I've gotta go 
to work" feeling. It's "I'm going to get involved in decisions, my opinion 
counts." So the worker has a new attitude about the job. "What am I going to 
learn today? What am I going to get involved in?" 
</P>
<P>
Q. Those are the mental and emotional differences, but what about the very 
tangible, specific tasks workers do during the day. How would that change with 
the team concept? 
</P>
<P>
A. If you're constantly improving the process, the manufacturing process 
throughout the plant, your task is going to change. You're going to find a 
better way of doing it. Health and safety gets involved. If you find that 
you're bending over too much to pick up a part that's too heavy, and you bring 
that to someone's attention, the team will sit down and design something 
different that will ease the load so it's not so much stress on your back. So 
that changes, and that's participation. That's a form of participation that's 
really happening. So it makes the job easier. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What else? 
</P>
<P>
A. You may bring an idea to the job that increases the speed or the 
productivity of the job, but makes it easier to do. That's an improvement. And 
then there are improved skills. If I learn somebody else's job, or if I'm on a 
team of, let's say, six members and we cross our skills, each day I may do a 
different job -- if the team decides that and I decide that with the team. It's 
not management that decides this. The team decides this. How can we do our job 
as a team? I may do six different jobs over the period of a week. Or I can 
relieve other people who are doing their jobs, so now the relief system and the 
ease of operation is increased because everyone has these skills. 
</P>
<P>
Q. One of the effects of the team concept is doing away with specific job 
descriptions and titles, is that right? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But these are the issues that strike fear into workers. The team concept has 
been called a scheme to maintain the same level of production with fewer 
people. Are you seeing that happen? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, I think it's inevitable. The work force is changing; the workplace is 
changing. We have job security in the contracts now, so people are secure with 
their jobs. As long as the plant needs to produce cars, you have your job, and 
that's kind of important. That's built into the contract. However, there is the 
need to remain competitive so that there are jobs and we are viable globally 
and nationally. You're going to find that workers will become more skillful, 
and in the process, modularity in manufacturing is going to become more and 
more prevalent. You'll be building larger parts, so you'll need fewer parts. If 
you need fewer parts, you need fewer hands. So there's going to be a slow 
attrition of the present work force to remain competitive. But the jobs of the 
workers today are protected. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there any way that future jobs can be saved? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are things that we are doing in Detroit that will create new jobs and 
new opportunities in the automotive business. As the decision making is pushed 
onto the floor and the worker gets more involved in the solutions rather than 
the problems, the worker becomes more knowledgeable. As the worker becomes more 
knowledgeable and the customers become more loyal, there is greater market 
share or penetration. Not fewer, but more jobs are created. So the operator 
becomes in more control over his or her own destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What if companies don't join in the team concept of management? 
</P>
<P>
A. Those firms will lose market share. These are things that will happen to 
those that are innovative and creative. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where does your company come in? The UAW hired you in 1988 to help it ease 
into the team concept. Is that about right? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, we were hired by the UAW and Ford on the Joint Quality Program. We go 
in the plant, on the national, divisional and local level. On the local level 
we work with plant managers, and we work with the president and chairman of the 
local union, on forming joint programs, developing quality group concepts. It's 
quality groups rather than team concepts that we're developing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the difference? 
</P>
<P>
A. One's more palatable than the other as far as the worker is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How so? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think you answered that earlier when you asked me why is there this 
negativity about the team concept. If we talk about quality groups, the workers 
are more receptive. They're less conditioned. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So it's just different title, same thing? 
</P>
<P>
A. Different title, same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In working with Ford and the UAW, which side hired you? 
</P>
<P>
A. Both sides. I'm straight down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And both sides pay you? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What exactly do you do to allay the fears of a union member who thinks he's 
going to lose his job because of this? Is that part of your job? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's part of our job. We work with communicating on all levels within the 
plant so things are understood. There's clarity. If you're going to get people 
to respond positively, you have to give them information so they can respond 
positively. If you leave something out, they get uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Give me an example of what your company does to help ease the auto workers 
into this idea. 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, last year, we closed down 40 plants at Ford, put up these huge tents 
that are 100 feet by 200 feet, and we put on a joint quality presentation 
between local UAW and national UAW people and local plant people and national 
Ford people. And we got all the workers under the tent, and we talked about 
market share and things gone wrong and things gone right, and how that relates 
to the product that they're building, and how important it is to quality, to 
market share, and how each individual worker is important to the process. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What was the response? 
</P>
<P>
A. Of the 117,000 workers we talked to, 54,000 took the time to fill out a 
request of ours, to tell us about their workstations, what equipment and tools 
need to be improved, how we can improve their job or jobs. That kind of 
response is astounding. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What plants are you specifically working at for Ford? 
</P>
<P>
A. We're working with the Wayne Assembly Plant in Wayne, Mich., on the CT20 
project, the new Escort, in developing the joint quality committees and 
programs, team-building within certain zones within the plant and gradually 
moving into a spirit of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Has that plant gone down at all in numbers of employees because of this? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. It hasn't. When we're talking about going down in numbers of employees, 
we're talking about the future. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You were at the UAW convention a few weeks ago. What were you doing? 
</P>
<P>
A. I was an observer. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The dissidents were articulate and persuasive. I'm wondering if they spoke 
for a small minority or voiced the fears of a larger group of union members. 
</P>
<P>
A. I think that they gave an intelligent presentation. I think the union 
members are quite bright. And I thought they represented their platform well. 
And I think the democratic process is to have a countervailing issue or group 
or caucus like that. But I don't think that there were voters sitting back 
there who wanted to raise their hand with the dissidents but didn't.

<P>
'CYRANO' HAS MORE PERFUME THAN PANACHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The white plumes are waving at the Grove Shakespeare Festival Amphitheatre in 
Garden Grove. "Cyrano de Bergerac" is back. 
</P>
<P>
This "Cyrano" is respectably wistful, but it's not especially exciting. 
First-timers will appreciate the romance at the heart of the story. But they 
won't laugh as much as some "Cyrano" audiences do. Nor will they see the kind 
of spectacle that justifies the three-hour length. 
</P>
<P>
This focus on romance fulfills the intention of director Thomas F. Bradac. The 
Grove season this year has been dubbed "A Season of Romance." (At least that's 
what it says on the program cover; it's hard to figure out how the festival's 
other current show, "The Songs of War" at the indoor Gem Theatre, fits into 
this concept.) 
</P>
<P>
Bradac signals his emphasis on the romance of "Cyrano" with the first image: 
Cyrano (Charles Lanyer) is silhouetted in profile against red light, smelling a 
rose with his jutting nose. Chuck Estes' music is lush and heaving. 
</P>
<P>
Cyrano then disappears until his grand entrance a few minutes later, and the 
rush of hectic activity in the initial crowd scene fills the stage. But Bradac 
interrupts the hubbub to introduce the young lovers, Roxane (Kamella Tate) and 
Christian (David Anthony Smith). The rest of the crowd freezes as they make 
their first appearances and their initial some-enchanted-evening eye contact, 
assisted by David C. Palmer's lighting design. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to establishing the evening's priorities, these directorial touches 
help clarify the essential story. Then, when Cyrano makes his first public 
appearance by striding up the amphitheater's center aisle, we're to laugh. His 
next speeches are traditionally the funniest scenes in the play. 
</P>
<P>
Lanyer's Cyrano says the right words, but they don't crackle through the night 
air as they should. Some of this can be attributed to Brian Hooker's 
translation of Edmond Rostand's verse. Some of the nose metaphors, for example, 
are too stuffy or puzzling ("portfolio," "blue cucumber"). 
</P>
<P>
But Lanyer's delivery of these lines doesn't help. They sound recited rather 
than spontaneous. And the duel with Valvert lacks variety and dash. (John 
Walcutt did the fight choreography.) 
</P>
<P>
Lanyer is much more effective in the quieter moments later on, when he 
expresses his devotion to Roxane. Here is a gallant lover. But we don't quite 
understand Cyrano's public charisma; we don't get the grand sweep of his 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
One would expect an alfresco production to reverse the priorities, to do better 
with the bigger moments instead of the smaller ones. But in fact, the night sky 
overhead lends lyricism to the tender spots in the script -- one of the best 
moments is at the end of Act I, when Cyrano, front and center and bearing a 
fluttering flag, pauses to comment on the loveliness of Paris in moonlight. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the human-made spectacle seems somewhat reduced. This may be due to the 
capabilities of the stage, as well as to the desire to keep the show moving at 
the expense of changing scenery. Still, it's clear that D. Martyn Bookwalter's 
one set is more appropriate for some of the five scenes than it is for others. 
</P>
<P>
Bookwalter's unicorn gargoyles reflect Cyrano's preoccupation with his own 
unusual protuberance -- a clever addition to the imagery of the play. But the 
gargoyles and the sturdy background wall of Romanesque arches look distinctly 
out of place in a bakery and on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
The battle scene is especially artificial; we don't feel the danger that Cyrano 
is in. And because Roxane doesn't bother to bring her customary feast to the 
soldiers when she sneaks through the enemy lines, her character is somewhat 
diminished. She becomes merely lovestruck rather than an adventurous lady 
bountiful for the starving troops. 
</P>
<P>
Tate is nevertheless a sly Roxane as well as a winsome one; she handles oily Le 
Guiche (Carl Reggiardo) as a snake charmer handles a cobra. It's too bad, 
though, that Reggiardo is as oily as all that; Cyrano deserves a more 
formidable foil. 
</P>
<P>
David Anthony Smith is smaller and not quite as vacant as Christian is 
sometimes played, but he catches most of the comedy in the character 
nevertheless, and his demise is quite touching -- almost as much as Cyrano's. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Bryan Cartmell is a solid Le Bret, and Harry Woolf is a jolly old baker. 
Lyndall L. Otto's costumes are respectful of the period. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12852 Main St., Garden Grove, Thursdays through Sundays at 8:30 p.m., 
ending Aug. 12. Tickets: $10-$23; (714) 636-7213.

MARTHA FULLER SAYS HER PIECE IN COMBINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cathy Curtis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people who claim they aren't technically oriented don't get seriously 
involved in photography. But Martha Fuller enjoys the medium precisely because, 
she says, "I realized I could do whatever I wanted to do -- mash all the 
chemicals together or change the light. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
One of her manipulated images, "State of Grace," is in the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum exhibit "Photographs From the Permanent Collection," along with work by 
such prominent California photographers as Lewis Baltz and John Divola. The 
show opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller, 40, came to photography after traveling around the United States and 
Canada judging horses. In an interview recently at her ocean-view Laguna Beach 
home, she described that life as "being on the move, living in funky hotels 
with every strata of society, from the top end to the lowest groom." 
</P>
<P>
When she moved to California from Toronto in 1985, Fuller said, she felt a 
freedom to do what she wanted, away from "support systems and expectations" of 
her past. At the Art Institute of Southern California in Laguna Beach -- where 
she had planned to study painting and drawing -- she became captivated by "the 
portability and adventure" of photography. 
</P>
<P>
She later enrolled in the graduate studio art program at Cal State Fullerton 
without realizing that there were two prominent photographers on the faculty: 
Eileen Cowin -- whose meticulously staged "docudramas" in Cibachrome are 
included in the Newport Harbor show -- and Darryl Curran. 
</P>
<P>
"Eileen was not on the same wavelength as me," Fuller said candidly. "I knew in 
a matter of months that spending hours sketching a pose (for a photograph) was 
not what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
But Curran -- whose work incorporates unusual juxtapositions and 
superimpositions of images -- was "sort of intuitively my mentor from the 
beginning," Fuller said. "His influence was more his presence" than any 
explicit instruction, she said. "For me, the less interference I have, the more 
I work, the more I'm challenged. He was always encouraging me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Fuller doesn't like what she calls the "rigid" aspects of photography -- its 
standard rectangular format and flat surface -- so she tries to subvert them in 
various ways. Most of this legerdemain goes on in the darkroom. She combines 
various images, manipulates a print so that its edges resemble a spill of 
liquid, or "draws" on the film with a penlight. 
</P>
<P>
The drawing "is the biggest magic of all," she said. "I never know till it's 
finished and starts to revert back to a silvery color what it will look like." 
</P>
<P>
"State of Grace," in the Newport Harbor exhibit, is the result of projecting 
several slides on top of one another, allowing the sandwich of disparate images 
to be the subject of the work. Views of old men she saw on a trip to Nepal are 
juxtaposed with a shot of African children pushing against the window of her 
car ("a really painful image in its original form") and an abstract image taken 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
The semi-veiled imagery that results suggests to Fuller the curiously selective 
process of memory as well as the gap between what the eye sees and what the 
camera records. Images "combine that you'd never think of combining, and they 
suggest something different in combination," she said. Still, she adds, the 
resulting photograph "has to be something that's not so dense it's confusing." 
</P>
<P>
Travel to Third World countries is Fuller's way of recapturing some of the 
nomadic qualities of her previous career. She intended no political or social 
meaning in the piece, she said, adding, "I don't know how an artist could be 
effective in terms of political things." 
</P>
<P>
Another work that resulted from the Nepal trip is a photo-triptych in which 
Fuller's own image gradually merges with the figures of two men -- one in 
traditional dress except for his Nike running shoes -- in a Katmandu street. 
</P>
<P>
"My interest was in making a self-portrait and in how I was becoming part of 
the culture," she said. "I'm aware of seeing what I see from my (American 
tourist's) side of the street. . . . I certainly try to immerse myself as much 
as I can . . . but I'm still an observer." 
</P>
<P>
Her primary interest as a traveler is, she said, in "the similarities and 
differences we all share -- religions, superstitions, rites of passages." She 
has produced two deliberately "intuitive," unstructured, one-of-a-kind books of 
images culled from her journeys. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, however, one subject that absolutely does not interest her as a 
photographer is the equestrian world of her past. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so familiar to me, I didn't think it would teach me anything," she said. 
"The less I know, the more intrigued I am." 
</P>
<P>
The honor of having work in the Newport Harbor permanent collection is unusual 
for someone fresh out of graduate school -- Fuller received her master's degree 
last spring from Cal State Fullerton -- but there was a mitigating 
circumstance. Her work was one of two pieces by Cal State Fullerton studio-art 
graduate students purchased by the Special Collection Program of the Frederick 
R. Weisman Foundation in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller's piece was selected by foundation director Henry Hopkins, Newport 
Harbor director Kevin Consey and by Jerry Samuelson, dean of the university's 
school of arts, and donated to the museum. (The other piece, a blown-glass 
sculpture by Jeanie and Rolph Wald, was given to the university.) 
</P>
<P>
"Fullerton means a great deal to me because it was my home more than 40 years 
ago," Weisman said. Weisman is president and chief executive officer the 
Frederick Weisman Co. in Maryland and is the founder of the art collection that 
bears his name. Weisman is well known for his active interest in new artists. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman said he intends the Cal State Fullerton project to be the first of 
several purchase-and-donate programs at universities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Photographs From the Permanent Collection" opens Friday at Newport Harbor Art 
Museum and will remain on view through Sept. 24. The museum is at 850 San 
Clemente Drive in Newport Beach and is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday 
through Sunday. Admission is $3 general, $2 for students and seniors, $1 for 
children 6 to 17. Information: (714) 759-1122.

<P>
An elderly woman was killed Sunday when her car went through a red light, 
struck a pickup truck and crashed through the display window of an auto 
dealership in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Inga Jones, 83, of Garden Grove was pronounced dead on arrival at UC Irvine 
Medical Center after the 6:55 p.m. accident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was driving west on Garden Grove Boulevard when she apparently failed 
to notice the red light at Brookhurst Street, said Detective Mike Clabaugh of 
the Garden Grove Police Department. Her car hurtled into a pickup truck, then 
careened into the front of Vina Auto Sales. 
</P>
<P>
Clabaugh said Jones was fatally injured when she struck the steering wheel and 
dashboard of her car. She was not wearing a seat belt.

A pedestrian struck by two cars in South Laguna was identified today by 
hospital officials as Herrisa Pennywell, 26, of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Pennywell remained in critical condition at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center in Mission Viejo after the accident Sunday on Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
She was struck as she attempted to cross the highway about 1:30 p.m. near West 
Street, Laguna Beach police said. After being knocked into the hood and 
windshield of a car driven by a Long Beach man, Pennywell rolled back into the 
roadway and was struck by another motorist driving in a northbound lane. 
</P>
<P>
Both drivers stopped and summoned help. Neither was cited, Police Sgt. Ray 
Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
Pennywell's identity initially was a mystery because she carried no 
identification. Lardie said her boyfriend provided identification.

CITY TREASURER HID MAYOR'S ROLE IN DEPOSITS AT FAR EAST, AUDITOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times wire services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city treasurer's office tried to cover up Mayor Tom Bradley's involvement 
in placing $2 million in city funds with a bank employing him by altering a 
document stating the deposits were made "per the mayor," an auditor said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Corser, who directed the audit of Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg's policy on 
time deposits, said the competitive bid sheet concerning the controversial 
investment was doctored following questions by a reporter about the mayor's 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Corser told the City Council's Finance and Revenue Committee that during the 
early stages of an audit in June, Rittenberg continued to maintain that city 
investment policies were followed in the purchase of two $1-million time 
deposits March 22 at Far East National Bank. But when it became clear that 
auditors had found policy violations, Rittenberg and his staff admitted that 
competitive bids were added to a bid sheet, Corser said. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials were asked to look at the bid sheet to determine what had been 
written next to the note about the Far East investment, Corser said. They 
determined the notation, "whited out" with correction fluid, said "per the 
mayor." Additionally, a black felt marker was used to draw a line across the 
back to further hide the reference, he said.

THATCHER SHAKES UP CABINET IN ATTEMPT TO HALT SLIDE IN POPULARITY

<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appointed new foreign and defense secretaries 
today, fired two other Cabinet ministers and switched around several more in 
the biggest government shake-up since she won power. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher named John Major, one of the least-known members of her 22-member 
Cabinet, as the new foreign secretary. He replaces Sir Geoffrey Howe, who was 
moved to a vacant post as deputy prime minister and the governing Conservative 
Party's leader in the House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, battling to halt her government's slide in popularity, also 
put new appointees in an array of major posts including the portfolios for 
Northern Ireland and the environment. Reporters had waited eagerly outside 
Thatchers residence at 10 Downing St. for word on the Cabinet shuffle. Thatcher 
fired her harassed Transport Secretary Paul Channon, who had been accused of 
bungling bomb warnings before Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Scotland on 
Dec. 21, and Social Secretary John Moore. 
</P>
<P>
The two other Cabinet ministers to depart -- Defense Secretary George Younger 
and Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young -- said they were resigning to 
resume business careers. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King was named defense secretary in an apparent 
reward after four years as Britain's top official in the embattled province. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Major as foreign secretary marked a meteoric rise from his 
former Cabinet post as chief secretary to the treasury, the No. 2 financial 
official. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old son of a circus trapeze artist was raised in poverty in south 
London's run-down Brixton District, never went to college and worked as a 
building laborer before making a career in banking. 
</P>
<P>
He entered Parliament in the May, 1979, general election that brought Thatcher 
to power and ousted a socialist Labor Party government. 
</P>
<P>
The move of Howe, 62, to deputy prime minister was widely regarded as a 
demotion from one of the most prestigious jobs in the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher also brought into the Cabinet another member of the class of 1979, 
Christopher Patten, a rising star from the party's liberal wing, as the new 
environment secretary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party Chairmanship 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting anxiety at the government's drop in the polls and its drubbing in 
elections for the European Parliament last month, Thatcher shifted Education 
Secretary Kenneth Baker to the chairmanship of the Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson will take over from Channon as transport 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's move is the latest step back up the government ladder after he 
resigned in disgrace as trade and industry secretary in 1983 following a sex 
scandal with his secretary. He was brought back into the government two years 
ago.

A 7-year-old cystic fibrosis patient who underwent a heart-lung transplant in 
April died early today at Stanford University Hospital of complications of 
surgery, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
David Laird Jr., who suffered from a severe form of the disease since birth, 
died of postoperative infection and pneumonia, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, son of Deanna and David Laird Sr. of Ceres, was the youngest patient 
with the disease to have a heart-lung transplant at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"David was an exceptional kid. He had a lot of spirit," said hospital spokesman 
Diarmuid McGuire. "He was a fighter. That was one of the reasons he was chosen, 
I think, for this very difficult procedure. His spirit was so strong."

Janet Lee Auchincloss Morris, the mother of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, died 
Saturday night after a long illness at Hammersmith Farm, the family estate. 
Mrs. Morris, 81, had been suffering Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Both Onassis and her sister Lee Radziwill Ross, the wife of Hollywood producer 
Herbert Ross, were at their mother's bedside when she died. Mrs. Morris had 
been a leading member of society in Newport, R.I., and Washington, D.C., for 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Morris married stockbroker John V. Bouvier III on July 7, 1928. After the 
birth of their two daughters, the marriage ended in divorce in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
She married Washington financier Hugh D. Auchincloss, the father of three, on 
June 21, 1942. The couple had two children, Janet Auchincloss Rutherford, who 
died in 1985, and James Auchincloss. Hugh Auchincloss died in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling estate of Hammersmith Farm was the site of the wedding on Sept. 
12, 1953, of the then young Life society photographer Jacqueline Bouvier and 
John F. Kennedy, then the junior senator from Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Morris is survived by her husband, Bingham W. Morris, whom she married several 
years ago after the death of Auchincloss. She also leaves a sister, Winifred 
d'Olier of Villanova, Pa., her three children, three stepchildren, 14 
grandchildren and stepgrandchildren and a great-granddaughter.

EMERGENCY STAY DELAYS TRIAL OF CIA CHIEF IN IRAN-CONTRA CASE

<P>
A federal appeals court today temporarily delayed the Iran-Contra trial of the 
CIA's former station chief in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court in Richmond issued an emergency stay at the request of the 
Justice Department, putting off the trial of Joseph Fernandez in order to 
address national security issues that are threatening to kill the case. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton told a pool of prospective jurors to go home, 
saying he would call them back after the appeals court has an opportunity to 
rule on the national security questions. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Hilton rejected motions by the prosecutors in the case that 
would have allowed the CIA to protect details of some of its programs and the 
names of three of its stations and facilities in Latin America from disclosure 
during the Fernandez trial. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez was to go on trial today on four criminal charges of obstructing and 
making false statements to the CIA inspector general's office and the Tower 
Commission. Fernandez allegedly tried to cover up his assistance to Oliver L. 
North's secret supply effort to the Nicaraguan Contras.

BUSH SEEKS FULL FUNDING FOR STEALTH; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS URGED TO SUPPORT BOMBER AT COST OF $70.2 BILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush asked Congress today to provide full funding for the stealth 
bomber, saying the United States needed maximum flexibility as it pressed ahead 
with arms control talks. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a revolutionary plane with revolutionary technology and again I would 
strongly urge your support on that," Bush said at the start of a meeting with 
Senate Armed Services Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$70.2-Billion Program 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is backing a $70.2-billion program to build 132 B-2, or 
stealth, bombers at a cost of $530 million per plane. Bush wants $4.7 billion 
for the plane in the 1990 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Development of the aircraft, designed to evade detection by radar, has been 
plagued by problems, and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.) wants a freeze in production funds until the plane completes flight 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of Congress want to kill the program completely, but both Nunn 
and Bush say that would complicate U.S. arms control strategy by weakening the 
military's bomber arm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Security, Arms Talks 
</P>
<P>
Bush was asked by reporters how he could justify the costly program in the face 
of rising social needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The prime responsibility of a President of the United States is the national 
security of the United States and I'm determined to put forth a program that is 
sound in every way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how I justify it and I also justify it because when you look at the 
full defense program, I want to have maximum flexibility as we have arms 
control negotiations," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Back to the Drawing Board' 
</P>
<P>
After the talk with Bush, Nunn told reporters that cancellation of the B-2 
would leave the United States without an effective penetrating bomber by the 
late 1990s and "we'd have to go back to the drawing board on arms control." 
</P>
<P>
The stealth flew for the first time a week ago in a highly publicized test that 
was televised across the country. An earlier test failed when takeoff was 
aborted because of a faulty fuel gauge. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also asked Congress to back his 1990 budget-year request for $4.6 billion 
for the "Star Wars" anti-missile system, which he called critically important. 
The House Armed Services Committee has already slashed the request by more than 
$1 billion.

WALKOUTS BY COAL MINERS 'A SCREAM OF DESPAIR,' SOVIET PARLIAMENT TOLD

<P>
Widespread strikes by Soviet miners are "a scream of despair," a member of the 
Supreme Soviet Parliament declared today in a startlingly frank debate 
televised across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who listened patiently to the entire 
debate, acknowledged that the walkouts had struck "a serious blow to the 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
Other deputies to the Parliament warned that the strike movement could quickly 
spread to other industries and said that, despite a slow return to work in the 
coal mines, social tension remained high. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a scream of despair," declared Yury Golik, a law lecturer and deputy 
from the city of Kemerovo in western Siberia's Kuzbass coal basin where strike 
committees took control two weeks ago, bringing the mines to a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
"Explosions have started, and we can expect a chain reaction," said Alexei 
Boiko from the Donbass in the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President and party chief Gorbachev, who has issued three appeals for a 
return to work in the mines, looked on. 
</P>
<P>
The assembly was summoned into emergency session as tens of thousands of miners 
remained on strike in several key coal-producing regions. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been pushed onto the streets not by a shortage of soap, but by a 
shortage of justice," Boiko said. 
</P>
<P>
"The miners of Donetsk trust nobody and nothing. This is what we have come to. 
. . . There is no defense, not from the work councils, not from the unions, not 
from the party committees. There is no defense, and that's an end of it." 
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Fyodorov, a young deputy from the west Ural industrial city of 
Cheboksary said: "This is not just the working class striking. This is the 
whole people showing they have been led into despair." 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic portrayal of the extent of worker discontent over the failure of 
Gorbachev's perestroika reform program to bring immediate improvements in their 
lives came in an emergency debate on the mine strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a televised appeal from Gorbachev on Sunday and another warning at the 
start of the debate today of the possible effect of further stoppages on the 
ailing economy, tens of thousands of miners remained on strike. 
</P>
<P>
Miners in the Kuzbass region in Central Asia went back to work over the weekend 
after a Kremlin commission agreed to meet most of their demands -- including 
supplies of consumer goods and food, extra shift payments and local control of 
mine profits. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said today that local financial control had to be granted quickly in 
other industries to head off further unrest. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless financial independence is granted to other branches of industry, they 
could all rise up as well," one speaker, who said he had visited several key 
industrial areas, told the assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who came under implicit fire 
from several deputies Monday, have pledged that the Kuzbass settlement will be 
applied to all other coal fields. 
</P>
<P>
But economists say the agreements could stretch the country's already ailing 
finances close to the breaking point.

EXXON PROFITS DIVE $1 BILLION 2ND QUARTER; 
</P>
<P>
87% PLUNGE TIED TO $850 MILLION IN OIL CLEANUP COSTS

<P>
Exxon Corp.'s second-quarter profits plunged by more than $1 billion, largely 
due to an estimated $850-million cost associated with the nation's worst oil 
spill, the company reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Net income fell 87% to $160 million, or 13 cents a share, from $1.2 billion, or 
90 cents a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter, Exxon said. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Bill Smith said the drop was the result of "a special 
provision" allowing for an estimated $850 million, or 67 cents a share, in 
cleanup costs for the March 24 spill of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker in Alaska's 
Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Without the special provision, Smith said the company's second-quarter earnings 
would have been $1.01 billion, or 80 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the charge "does not include the potential effect of 
litigation, which cannot reasonably be assessed at this time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$600 Million Spent 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has already spent about $600 million on cleaning up the spill, the worst 
in U.S. history, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
He stressed the $850 million is only an approximate cost including estimated 
expenses and estimated insurance recoveries, and cautioned against drawing the 
conclusion that there is only $250 million remaining to be spent in the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has previously disclosed it had an estimated $400 million in spill 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon revenues for the second quarter were $23.61 billion compared with $21.63 
billion for the same period in 1988, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Investors reacted negatively to the announcement, with Exxon off $1.125 a share 
at $45.625 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Young of Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York said he 
changed his rating of Exxon stock this morning from a "hold" to an "avoid." 
</P>
<P>
Young said he had anticipated the sharp earnings drop since last week because 
congressional testimony indicated a write-off of this magnitude as a result of 
of the cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consensus at Odds 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst, who declined comment until he had seen the actual Exxon 
numbers, said the consensus among analysts had been that Exxon would report 
higher operating earnings, before the write-off, than 80 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the tanker Exxon Valdez 
fouled hundreds of miles of water and coastline. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the Valdez spill appears likely to approach that of the March, 
1979, near-meltdown at the Three Mile Island No. 2 nuclear power plant in 
Pennsylvania. Cleanup efforts in that accident, which continue after more than 
10 years, have cost General Public Utilities Corp. an estimated $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Chairman L. G. Rawl said that despite the cost of the cleanup, Exxon's 
financial condition remains strong. "We are continuing to pursue our long-term 
business strategies and to implement planned capital programs," he said.

Industry analysts said today that Chrysler Corp. will soon announce a program 
under which it will substantially reduce its number of white-collar workers to 
raise profitability levels. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the cuts could affect as much as 10% of Chrysler's salaried work 
force, which is now about 31,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chrysler declined to comment on the specifics of such a program, 
company spokeswoman Karen Stewart hinted that an announcement could be made by 
company Chairman Lee Iacocca on Thursday at a weekly meeting of top company 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ongoing belt-tightening is simply a way of life at Chrysler as we look for 
ways to reduce cost," Stewart said, calling any job reductions a "basic 
competitive action" necessary because of incentive costs and increased industry 
competition.

Champion Spark Plug Co. shareholders today approved the company's $800-million

Cooper's cash buyout at $21 per share was approved by shareholders of Toledo, 
Ohio-based Champion during a special meeting in Houston.

Cooper, a diversified maker of commercial and industrial products, in February 
outbid Dana Corp., which offered $590 million in cash and securities, to

Dana, a Toledo-based automotive parts manufacturer, had signed an agreement to

buyout fell through. 
</P>
<P>
In making the bid for Champion, Robert Cizik, Cooper's chairman and president, 
said he had no objection to Champion's agreement to pay Dana.

HONEYWELL TELLS PLANS FOR MAJOR RESTRUCTURING 
</P>

<P>
Honeywell Inc., the subject of intense takeover speculation for the past two 
weeks, today announced a major restructuring program that includes reducing its 
weapons business and cutting 4,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it also planned to repurchase up to 10 million shares of its 
common stock on the open market and to sell a "substantial portion" of its 50% 
stake in Yamatake-Honeywell, a Japanese controls maker. Analysts have valued 
that holding at nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping program will result in a 65-cent increase in Honeywell's annual 
dividend, to $2.75 a share, and could include a special cash dividend, said 
Chairman James J. Renier. 
</P>
<P>
Renier said he expects the restructuring to improve operating profits by about 
$150 million over the next 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell is the leading manufacturer of torpedoes for the U.S. Navy and also 
supplies small, medium and large ammunition to the U.S. Army, Kathy Tunheim, a 
company spokeswoman, said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street greeted today's announcement with open arms. Honeywell jumped $3.37 
1/2 to $88.87 1/2 in active late-morning trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, following a delayed opening. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of 1988 Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Renier said the reduction of Honeywell's weapons business is part of a strategy 
begun in 1988 to "concentrate on core controls businesses that principally 
serve commercial markets as well as the market for military and space 
controls." 
</P>
<P>
The reduction will "proceed over time in a responsible manner that recognizes 
the U.S. government's interest in these businesses so as not to adversely 
affect national security interests, our government program obligations or the 
value of these businesses to Honeywell shareholders," Renier said. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons business accounts for about 20% of Honeywell's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Tunheim would not say whether a sale of the business is one of the 
options being considered. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tunheim said negotiations to sell the company's stake in 
Yamatake-Honeywell, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will begin 
within a few days. She would not identify potential buyers. Japanese investors 
currently own half of the company, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell's restructuring program will include the elimination of 4,000 jobs 
worldwide over the next 18 months, including 300 corporate staff positions 
targeted in a previous announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell currently employs about 78,000 workers. Many of the job cuts will be 
made through attrition, but layoffs will be necessary.

San Diego Padres owner Joan Kroc donated to the Hall of Fame today a letter 
written in 1959 by John F. Kennedy to Jackie Robinson pledging support in 
fighting racial injustice. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc, who purchased the letter in order to give it to the Hall of Fame, made 
the presentation to Hall of Fame President Edward Stack. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard about the letter, I knew it was something the Hall of Fame should 
have," Kroc said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was the first player to break the racial barriers in major league 
baseball and is a member of the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"This document deserves to be in the Hall of Fame," Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is still a lot of work to do, but we've come a long way," Kroc said of 
baseball's progress in minority hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy was a member of the U.S. Senate when he wrote the letter and was 
elected President a year later.

Denver Nuggets free agent Wayne Cooper signed a contract with the Portland 
Trail Blazers today. Blazers spokesman John Lashway said the contract was 
signed after the 6-foot-10 center underwent a physical by the Blazers' team 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
Lashway said details of the contract will be announced later. The Rocky 
Mountain News reported in Denver that Cooper was signing a three-year contract 
that NBA sources said would bring him $1.1 million a year.

REDS NO-SHOWS AT HALL OF FAME GAME;

RED SOX PLAY PICKUP TEAM WITH CINCINNATI STILL IN MONTREAL

The Cincinnati Reds' streak of bad luck continued today when transportation 
problems in Montreal kept them from playing the annual Hall of Fame game 
against the Boston Red Sox at Doubleday Field. 
</P>
<P>
The game was scheduled to start at 2 p.m. EDT, but at that time the Reds were 
in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
A Hall of Fame official said the Reds had bus problems and then difficulty 
chartering a plane for the trip to central New York. The bottom line was that 
they didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Bart Giamatti made the announcement to a crowd of about 9,100, who 
did not seem overly disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox did arrive on time and took batting practice and played an 
intra-squad game, also using players from Elmira of the New York State-Penn 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Reds had made it, Manager Pete Rose planned to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, facing allegations that he bet on baseball games, said last week that he 
did not want to take any of the spotlight away from former teammate Johnny 
Bench, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame on Sunday along with Carl 
Yastrzemski. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither he nor his team was here, and although the induction of Bench 
and Yastrzemski was the highlight of the Hall of Fame weekend, the undercurrent 
was all Rose. 
</P>
<P>
There were signs criticizing Giamatti's handling of the Rose matter hanging 
from local pubs and a smattering of boos when he was introduced at the 
induction ceremonies Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In the baseball shops that line the narrow streets of Cooperstown, Pete Rose 
memorabilia remained a hot item. 
</P>
<P>
The last thing the Reds needed today was an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected day off probably will help a team that has been devastated by 
injuries and controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The team came off a four-game sweep by Montreal and has lost eight straight to 
fall out of the National League West pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Confused Team' 
</P>
<P>
"It can't get much worse than this," reliever John Franco said. "It's been one 
thing after another." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds have been devastated by injuries and are playing without shortstop 
Barry Larkin, outfielder Paul O'Niell and reliever Rob Dibble. Along the way, 
just about every starter has missed some time, and 12 players have been on the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a real confused team right now because of all these injuries," Rose 
said Sunday after the Reds lost 12-4 to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do about it? Maybe you guys (reporters) can tell me." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are to play San Diego at home Tuesday night.
