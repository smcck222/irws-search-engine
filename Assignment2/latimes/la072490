SOUTER CONCURRED IN RULING ON LISTING ABORTION AS AN OPTION

David H. Souter, who is expected to face questions about his views on the 
abortion issue now that he has been nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court, has 
participated in one major abortion ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The matter came before the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1986, when Souter 
served on that state's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Souter ruled with the majority that doctors have a responsibility 
to test for birth defects and inform pregnant women of the option of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that the termination of pregnancy involves controversial and 
divisive social issues," the opinion said. "Nonetheless, the Supreme Court of 
the United States has held that a woman has a constitutionally secured right to 
terminate a pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
In a concurring opinion, Souter wondered what impact the ruling might have on 
doctors who oppose abortion but who are bound to advise patients of it as an 
alternative. The court did not rule on that issue. He suggested that such 
doctors could tell patients of their religious or moral scruples and refer them 
to other doctors in time for such testing.

BUCKEY JURY COMES CLOSE TO IMPASSE ON SIX COUNTS; 
</P>
<P>
MCMARTIN CASE: THE JUDGE ORDERS MEMBERS TO CONTINUE DELIBERATIONS DESPITE THEIR 
TROUBLE IN REACHING A CONSENSUS. THEY EARLIER REACHED A VERDICT ON SECOND 
CHARGE.

The jury in the McMartin Pre-School molestation retrial came perilously close 
Monday to an impasse on six of eight counts against Raymond Buckey, but a 
deadlock was averted when the judge ordered the panel to resume deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
The jury on Monday also reached a verdict on a second charge against the former 
nursery teacher. However, that verdict remained sealed, as did another verdict 
reached Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg ordered the jurors to continue 
deliberating after they sent him a note saying they were "having some trouble" 
reaching a consensus on the six remaining counts in a case that turned the 
nation's attention to the problem of child sex abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We appear to be hung on six counts," the jury's note said. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors had begun their third week of deliberations in the case Monday 
morning. Soon after receiving the judge's order in the late afternoon, they 
broke off for the day and were to resume deliberating Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 32, is accused of molesting three young girls at the now-closed 
Virginia McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach from 1979 until 1983. The 
former preschool teacher has steadfastly maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of a marathon first trial in January, Buckey and his mother, Peggy 
McMartin Buckey, 63, were acquitted of 52 other molestation counts involving a 
total of 11 children. 
</P>
<P>
The first jury deadlocked on the eight counts on which Buckey is being retried. 
</P>
<P>
The verdicts in January climaxed a trial that lasted nearly three years and 
cost $13.2 million, making it the longest, costliest criminal trial in U.S. 
history. The greatly scaled down retrial has lasted more than three months. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Buckey could be sentenced to up to 22 years in state prison. He 
would be credited for the nearly five years he spent in custody following his 
1984 arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The core of the prosecution was the testimony of the three girls, who said 
Buckey molested them, forced them to play sex games such as "naked movie star" 
and frightened them into silence. 
</P>
<P>
But when pressed by defense lawyer Danny Davis for details of the alleged sex 
abuse, all three girls repeatedly said, "I don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, the defense has argued that the children were brainwashed 
by overzealous therapists at the Children's Institute International in Los 
Angeles. The therapists, the defense argued, manipulated the children into 
leveling false allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The girls, now ages 14, 12, and 11, were allegedly molested when they were ages 
2 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
During his cross-examination of the girls, Davis noted that their testimony at 
the retrial often contradicted testimony they gave at the first trial and in 
videotaped interviews with the child therapists. 
</P>
<P>
The county grand jury handed down its initial indictments containing scores of 
charges in March, 1984. But all charges against five co-defendants, including 
Buckey's sister and grandmother, were dismissed for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The preschool was closed by the state in January, 1984, after the molestation 
allegations surfaced. In May, it was razed to make way for an office building, 
but not before a group of parents dug up the foundation in an inconclusive 
search for secret tunnels mentioned by some children.

"Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!" goes the refrain in the movies of the same 
name. Don't ask Jan Contreras of Arcadia to join in the singing, though. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving countless phone calls at home from giggling kids -- especially 
after the release of "Ghostbusters II" -- she realized that her telephone 
number, 446-7828, spelled GHOSTBU. 
</P>
<P>
What's worse, on two occasions she was investigated by Pacific Bell. Why? Angry 
parents wanted to know why Contreras' phone number was showing up on their 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
Contreras has since had the number changed. It was that, she said, or take her 
boyfriend's suggestion of "going into the business of getting rid of ghosts." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of who you gonna call, the dashboard sign on one parked car with a 
two-toned paint job in Pacific Palisades (see photo) had a helpful suggestion.

John Stein of Mar Vista wonders if there isn't something to the stereotype of 
health-obsessed Southern Californians, judging from local merchants with such 
names as "The Rug Doctor," "Floor Doctors," "Shower-Door Doctor," and "The

</P>
<P>
The latter, no doubt, has a great sink-side manner. 
</P>
<P>
And now, an exciting scene from next week's episode of Chocolate CHiPs: 
</P>

Signs on the city's Commuter Express buses warn that eating aboard isn't 
allowed. And the rules are enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Fishbein was making a downtown-to-Chatsworth run the other day when the 
driver stopped and declared: 
</P>
<P>
"I smell a cookie." 
</P>
<P>
He then confiscated a bag of freshly baked goods from a munching passenger. The 
edibles were returned to her when she reached her destination.

Bill Wolf, a vice president for Air L.A., collects memorable letters received 
by the local commuter airline. He shares some excerpts from his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"I am interested in a career in flight attendance," a Georgia woman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
A Portland man seeking an "airline travel career" said his past employment "was 
at a cafeteria in my high school as assistant cook, which takes a lot of 
working with the chief and dealing with the customers." 
</P>
<P>
A Finnish writer, perhaps thinking Air L.A. was the CIA, wrote: "I am writing 
to you because you do not take bribes. . . . (Such-and-such) mining company 
bribes people. . . . Would you be so kind and send (this) letter to the United 
Nations?" 
</P>
<P>
And then there was the mysterious postcard from Poland, which offered greetings 
and added: "Send friend with Poland." 
</P>
<P>
You may remember when locals joked that the freeway system had been named after 
an Israeli prime minister. After all, the signs said: "Begin Freeway."

WILSON AIDE APOLOGIZES FOR DEMOCRAT 'ENDORSEMENT' GAFFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Embarrassed officials from the Pete Wilson GOP gubernatorial campaign Monday 
removed three prominent Democrats from a list of local officeholders and 
business leaders endorsing the former San Diego mayor's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"We erred. Out of 61 (endorsers) we got three wrong. We apologize. It was not 
intentional and we will try not to do it again," campaign spokesman Otto Bos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Former state Sen. Jim Mills, chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Development 
Board, Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, and Roger Revelle, director emeritus of the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography -- all Democrats -- were listed as having 
endorsed Wilson in a press release issued by campaign officials on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At a Friday press conference, Wilson surrounded himself with what he called "an 
all-star" team of local supporters. A campaign press release listed "San 
Diegans for Wilson," identified as "a group of local citizens . . . pleased to 
endorse" Wilson's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Shumway, Revelle's daughter, said her father is "a lifelong Democrat" who 
was "very upset" about reports that he had endorsed Wilson. In fact, Revelle 
has endorsed Democrat Dianne Feinstein in the governor's race, Shumway said. 
</P>
<P>
She released a statement from Revelle, which read: 
</P>
<P>
"I have great respect for Pete Wilson, but I will vote for Dianne Feinstein for 
governor. We need Pete in the U.S. Senate. That is where he belongs." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Miller nor Mills said he was offended by being falsely identified with 
the Wilson camp, but said Wilson campaign officials were wrong when they 
released their names as endorsers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making any endorsement in the race for governor . . . as long as I am 
chairman of the MTDB," Mills said. "It would impair my effectiveness to serve 
the public if I started to get involved in races." 
</P>
<P>
Miller is on vacation, but district attorney spokesman Steve Casey said Miller 
"has great affection for Pete, but hasn't endorsed him." 
</P>
<P>
Bos blamed "confusion and a clerical error" for the faulty endorsements. 
According to Bos, the people listed under "San Diegans for Pete Wilson" were 
merely meant to be "experts in fields" where Wilson excelled as San Diego 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"We went down a list and categorized and talked to knowledgeable people where 
issues might arise in the campaign," Bos said. "Miller was a mainstay in 
helping write a campaign reform law. Mills was the father of the trolley idea. 
Revelle is an expert on sewage. Their names were inadvertently attached to the 
list." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, Mills and Revelle were the only names mistakenly included in the list 
of endorsers, Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're OK on all the others," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who is a U.S. senator, was an assemblyman before he was elected mayor 
of San Diego.

HIGH COURT MOVES INTO A NEW ERA; 
</P>
<P>
IS NOMINEE 'FUZZED UP' ENOUGH ON ABORTION ISSUE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President George Bush's nomination of New Hampshire Appeals Court Judge David 
Souter to succeed Justice William J. Brennan Jr. on the U.S. Supreme Court 
marks the beginning of a new and uncertain era in constitutional law. 
</P>
<P>
If he is confirmed by the Senate, the 50-year-old Republican jurist is expected 
to solidify a youthful majority that probably will endure beyond the turn of 
the century -- although once on the bench, justices can surprise ideologues of 
all stripes. But the tenor of his confirmation hearings -- and what they reveal 
about the quality of the President's choice -- will be an important signal of 
whether the White House and the Senate's leaders understand their 
responsibility to ensure that the country's passage into a new era is no more 
dislocating than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The judicial epoch that came to an end with Brennan's resignation -- the era of 
the Warren Court -- is something of a model in this regard. Because of its 
duration, people tend to forget just how gradually those justices asserted 
their views. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan and the late Chief Justice Earl Warren had been together on the court 
for almost a decade before they handed down the majority of their many landmark 
decisions. In the interim, they not only had laid a legal foundation for their 
theory of constitutional interpretation, but also had witnessed the emergence 
of a social and political consensus that obliged the court to attack the 
mountain of unresolved issues that had piled up during the previous decades of 
self-imposed judicial passivity. 
</P>
<P>
At present, no such consensus exists. The Republicans have controlled the 
Executive Branch for a decade, while the Democrats' power over both houses of 
Congress appears unshakeable. In the unending controversies over the so-called 
social issues, public opinion polls reveal a deeply split, increasingly 
polarized polity; on the most contentious of these issues -- abortion, for 
example -- the President's party is divided against itself. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the plain facts that Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole had in mind 
Sunday, when he bluntly warned that if Bush sent the Senate a nominee "who 
wants to overturn Roe vs. Wade, it's going to be a blood bath." With the 
distasteful experience of Ronald Reagan's failed attempt to put conservative 
ideologue Robert Bork on the court still fresh in everyone's mind, Dole's 
assessment seems on the mark. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday Bush said he had felt it "inappropriate" to inquire about Souter's 
views on Roe vs. Wade . In one case three years ago, Souter, then a New 
Hampshire Supreme Court justice, concurred in a ruling that doctors have a 
professional responsibility to test for birth defects and inform pregnant women 
of their option to obtain an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In his concurrence, however, Souter sought to delineate the decision's impact 
on physicians opposed to abortion. "The court does not hold that some or all 
physicians must make a choice between rendering services that they morally 
condemn and leaving their profession in order to escape malpractice exposures," 
he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the nominee may meet the criteria set by one White House aide, who said 
last weekend that the President was looking for someone whose position on Roe 
vs. Wade is "a little fuzzed up." 
</P>
<P>
But what the country requires in a Supreme Court justice is not fuzziness, but 
fairness. Whatever his principles, the country requires someone who, like 
Justice Brennan, can put the parochial predilections of creed and class aside 
in fidelity to the common good.

B-2 TAKING A LOT OF FLAK; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS URGED TO STOP PRODUCTION AFTER THE 15 ALREADY AUTHORIZED ARE COMPLETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For some months, the B-2 Stealth bomber has been losing its fight for survival 
because of rising costs and rising doubts that it could do any job better than 
far cheaper weapons. On Monday, Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed 
Services Committee, fired a couple more rounds at its moving parts. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin urged Congress to stop producing the hump-backed flying wings when the 
last of 15 already authorized is finished. Those 15 are enough to permit the 
Air Force to go on testing the plane's new technology. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin opposed a bill to shut the B-2 down last year, saying the Air Force was 
entitled to another budget cycle to make a better case for the plane. He now 
says it did not. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the absence of a clear-cut mission, one of the B-2's most serious 
problems is rotten timing. A budget crisis, serious enough to force President 
Bush to suspend his no-new-taxes pledge, has Washington in virtual 
round-the-clock meetings seeking a way out. The last thing a government budget 
in that shape needs is the most expensive airplane project in aviation history, 
especially when the cost keeps going up. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has ordered the Air Force to cut its 
planned B-2 fleet from 132 planes to 75. With production delays and inflation, 
the Congressional Budget Office calculates that the 75 planes will still cost 
nearly $7 billion more than what the entire fleet was estimated to cost in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
To complicate the cost picture, the General Accounting Office, which keeps 
track of such details for Congress, warns that nobody will know for certain 
whether the B-2 can do what it was designed to do until another three years of 
testing is completed. This would make continued production fiscally dicey at 
any time; with the current budget crunch, it is even riskier. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with one exception, other planes or missiles can perform any mission 
the Air Force wants to assign to the B-2. The Air Force says it would need the 
B-2 to track down and destroy Soviet missiles that could be rushed into hiding 
in event of a nuclear exchange. The flaw in this argument, though, is that the 
first B-2s could not track down mobile missiles, either. Nor can anyone be 
certain that they could ever be equipped for such a mission. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin's attack did not appear to diminish White House enthusiasm for the B-2 
Monday, and the Senate has not rushed to accept his position. But the stealth 
bomber cannot -- and should not -- shake off too many more direct hits like 
this.

OVERCOMING OBSTACLES TO PEACE TALKS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ARABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mohammed Tarbush refers to the newly formed Israeli government as "extremist" 
("A Palestinian Season of Gloom," Commentary, July 1). It is interesting to 
note that in its first three weeks of existence, Israel's "extremist" 
government has extended an invitation to Syrian President Hafez Assad to visit 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has offered the Iranians Israeli expertise in assisting the 
earthquake victims. It has also released 416 Arab prisoners from Israeli jails 
as a gesture of goodwill. And, furthermore, it has pledged that it would not 
resettle Soviet Jewish immigrants beyond the Green Line, i.e., the pre-1967 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
I would submit to Tarbush that if the PLO were similarly "extremist," there 
would be a good chance for a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict.

Contel Cellular Inc.: The Atlanta-based cellular phone services provider said 
it had a second-quarter loss of $29.3 million, contrasted with a $1.1-million 
profit in the year-ago period. The company said the loss was related to the 
acquisition in February of 13 cellular systems from McCaw Cellular 
Communications. The acquisitions tripled Contel's quarterly revenue -- to $44 
million.

with a profit of $9 million a year ago. Sales were up 13% to $344 million. 
Varian, which is reorganizing, said the loss was the result of $31.9 million in 
restructuring charges and $15.2 million in charges for discontinuing some 
operations.

25% to $8.6 million, while revenue rose 1% to $202.9 million. Research and 
development funding in the quarter rose 21%, Beckman said, and this investment 
in new products reduced earnings.

Bell Atlantic Corp.: Profit for the second quarter rose to $362.8 million, up 
6.2% from the same period in 1989. Total revenue was $3.08 billion, an increase 
of 6.7% from the previous year. The Philadelphia-based communications company

Mandela's Mercedes: Nelson Mandela has a new bright red $83,000 Mercedes-Benz, 
courtesy of black South African auto workers and Mercedes-Benz. The car was 
presented Sunday at a packed rally in Mdantsane township. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, released last February after more than 27 years in prison, thanked the 
Mercedes labor force and said the red color will "forever remind us of the 
blood the workers and people of our country have shed in the liberation 
struggle."

Last Will: Political writer George Will said his current best-seller, "Men at 
Work," is his first and last book on baseball. "I've said what I had to say and 
that's where I'll leave it," Will said in Pittsburgh. "Like Ted Williams, I 
know when it's time to get out of the game." Williams retired in 1960 after a 
home run in a late-season game.

Fire Sale: Nelson Bunker Hunt, who with brother William Herbert Hunt lost a 
fortune in the crash of the silver market, watched an auction Saturday in 
Roanoke, Tex., of his furniture, collectibles and other items that brought an 
estimated $450,000 to help pay off his creditors. "A $20 dime-store teapot sold 
for $150 and the crowd just went crazy," said one observer. An oak rocking 
chair fetched $3,000. But Nelson's son, Houston, was unhappy with it all. "This 
is really unpleasant," he said.

Knockout Tie: His work clothes are shorts, shoes and gloves, so heavyweight 
contender Evander Holyfield gets to spend his money on his play clothes. How 
much last year? "Eight thousand dollars," Holyfield said in the August issue of 
Gentlemen's Quarterly. "The important thing in a man's wardrobe is a tie . . . 
. It's got to be exotic." Holyfield meets James (Buster) Douglas for the 
heavyweight championship this fall.

JACK SMITH: THE QUESTION: TO TOSS OR NOT TO TOSS JUNK MAIL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trouble with junk mail is that you can't afford to throw it out without 
slitting the envelope and taking a look inside. It might contain money. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean those envelopes that say "You have already won a million dollars! 
or a trip to Bermuda." Somebody might win a million dollars but I know it won't 
be me. The odds make it hardly worth opening the envelope. 
</P>
<P>
However, I have been twice burned. Many years ago, when I was struggling to 
make ends meet, Reader's Digest excerpted five words of mine for its "rich, 
beautiful prose" department or whatever it was called. They did not ask my 
permission; they did not advise me. They simply sent me a $100 check, which I 
promptly threw into the wastebasket. Somehow I had second thoughts. It occurred 
to me that my name and address were typewritten, not stamped. I retrieved the 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
What a windfall that was! 
</P>
<P>
Many years later, in fact not long ago, I evidently dropped a corporation 
mailing into the wastebasket, only to learn later that it had contained 80 
shares of stock. I went to a great deal of trouble to have the stock replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, I find it hard to open all my junk mail. It is too tedious. I take 
chances. All envelopes that say I have won something I automatically throw 
away. I am a little more careful with the others. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, I opened a mailing the other day from an Eric Utne. I had never 
heard of Eric Utne and felt pretty sure that I didn't want to. 
</P>
<P>
The contents contained a pitch for a new magazine that, I had to admit, was 
more beguiling than most. I do not need a new magazine. I do not want a new 
magazine. I give magazines away by the cartonful. Hundreds of them. Magazines 
are stacked high on all our tables. We have at least two dozen unread 
Smithsonians. Good stuff, I know, but reading Smithsonians takes time that 
could otherwise be devoted to sex and violence on TV. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Eric Utne publishes something called Utne Reader, which is 
not a very attractive title. But its production method is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Utne says the magazine has a staff of four, plus "Nina, my bemused wife; a 
Buddhist physics professor, a socially responsible philanthropist; a Jungian 
dreams analyst; a candidate for the U.S. Senate; an anarcho-punk theorist; an 
organic herb farmer; plus a dozen media junkies who lend a hand." 
</P>
<P>
"For two months," Utne says, "we all read and clip whatever we find of interest 
in more than 1,000 alternative publications. Political exposes. How-to 
lifestyle pieces. Money advisories. Interviews with unusual people. Stories 
about the environment, survival, shenanigans in high places. Any and everything 
that you're not likely to find in mainstream newspapers and magazines." 
(Actually, I think you can find all of that stuff in The Times, in abundance, 
except maybe input from an anarcho-punk theorist, whatever that is.) 
</P>
<P>
Then, near deadline time, "we all get together in an all-night gathering that's 
come to be known as the Alternative Press Reading &amp; Dining Salon. We 
discuss what we've read. We talk. We argue. We nibble on pizza and popcorn. And 
by dawn's early light, we've got it -- what we feel is one of the most 
exciting, yet useful, magazines you can read today. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
An explanatory sheet begins with the kind of facts you can expect to find in 
Utne Reader. "If you believe that exercise will help you live longer . . . that 
small companies are better to work for than big ones . . . and that you can't 
possibly make money while maintaining your principles . . . there's something 
you should know. It won't. They aren't. You can. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Gee, I read just the other day that every step you climb adds four seconds to 
your life. And what about "a penny saved is a penny earned," and "honesty is 
the best policy?" 
</P>
<P>
It adds: "If revelations like these contradict axioms you learned at your 
mother's knee, there are more surprises to come. Just open Utne Reader to any 
page. Overturned truisms. Shattered shibboleths. Debunked bromides. Truth!" 
</P>
<P>
As I say, I'm intrigued by the Utne Reader's editorial methods, but I'm not 
sure I want to base my perceptions of our society on a journal put out by the 
likes of a Buddhist physics professor, a bemused wife, a Jungian dreams 
analyst, an organic herb farmer and an anarcho-punk theorist sitting around all 
night digesting pizza and clippings from 1,000 alternative press journals. 
</P>
<P>
However, if it's shattered shibboleths you crave, the address is Utne Reader, 
P.O. Box 1974, Marion, Ohio 43306. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately I've lost my post card for a free copy.

INTO THE NIGHT: A CLASS OUTING; 
</P>
<P>
IT WAS BACK TO SCHOOL FOR PARTY-GOERS CELEBRATING 'THE FRESHMAN' PREMIERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Thursday night's premiere of "The Freshman," a new comedy from 
Tri-Star Pictures. After a screening in Westwood, guests rode shuttle buses to 
the John Thomas Dye School at the top of Bel-Air for an al fresco buffet 
supper. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Marlon Brando and Matthew Broderick weren't there, but another star 
of the film was: Mzee, a 66-inch-long monitor lizard from Thailand. The 
reptile, which belongs to the second-largest lizard species on Earth, stumped 
around the grass on a leash and lolled in the arms of trainers Jim Brockett, 
Jules Sylvester and Gina Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Wild Kingdom: What does a Hollywood lizard eat on the set? Catered food? "He 
eats whatever he wants. He's a carnivore," explained Sylvester blithely. 
(Actually, Mzee looked like more than one producer in Hollywood.) 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: At the party were producer Mike Lobell (not one of your 
lizard-like producers); writer/director Andrew Bergman; stars Bruno Kirby and 
Penelope Ann Miller; Tom Brokaw; actors Maria Conchita Alonso, William 
Atherton, Gary Busey, Cathy Lee Crosby, Woody Harrelson and Mimi Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Lightweight blazers and pantsuits. One man redefined casual 
trailer-park chic with his clam digger-length cutoffs, accentuated with 
knee-high black hose. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment: Dancing to Glenn Miller, Nat "King" Cole, Madonna and a '70s 
disco-funk medley that sounded just fine until we got to Barry Manilow singing 
"Copacabana." 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Pizza, pasta, tortellini, garlic bread, salads and lethal chocolate 
marzipan brownies provided by Parties Plus cooks, who had baked loaves of bread 
shaped like lizards for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "Oh, he's so cute," exclaimed one lizard-loving woman, who quickly 
changed her tune when Mzee flicked her face with his four-inch Jacobsen's organ 
(the forked "tongue" that enables reptiles to smell). It added a new dimension 
to the old Hollywood sport of cheek-kissing. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: With the dearth of good premiere party locations in Los Angeles, 
Tri-Star found one in the Dye School, a rolling hillside in Bel-Air that 
provided a view of the city lights perfect for a clement summer night. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: A lot of people made the movie and skipped the party. Why? Could it 
be the prospect of riding in shuttle buses is a little bit too egalitarian for 
Hollywood's swells? Come on now. If we're going to have celebrities hectoring 
us endlessly about environmental awareness, the least they can do is use 
semi-public transportation.

ART BUCHWALD: BEATING PLUMBER ON CHAPTER 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the summer we live on an island, and we only see each other for two months. 
Yet it's amazing how much we get done in that short period of time. 
</P>
<P>
We were spread out on the beach last Wednesday, and someone said, "What 
happened to the Doubleglasses?" 
</P>
<P>
"Harry went into Chapter 11 and Mrs. Doubleglass went to Reno." 
</P>
<P>
"What is Chapter 11?" Dottie Tubridy, a visitor from Dublin, Ireland, asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It's when you can't pay your bills and you say to a judge, 'This is now your 
problem -- not mine.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why anyone would want to go into Chapter 11," Dottie went 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl replied, "They don't want to do it. They have to so the plumber won't 
beat them up." 
</P>
<P>
"Would a plumber really beat up a person because he can't pay his debts?" 
Dottie asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Not once," answered Crimea. "He'd beat him up 20 times. As a matter of fact, 
when someone can't pay his bills, there is a long line of people waiting to 
beat him up. That's why we have Chapter 11 laws, so the person can hide when 
the mob wants to tear him apart." 
</P>
<P>
Dottie was fascinated with all of this. "Is it a disgrace to go into 
bankruptcy?" 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be," said Joel the lawyer. "But now everybody's doing it. It's like 
buying a hot tub." 
</P>
<P>
Angel, another lawyer, declared, "It's very wise to do it, particularly if you 
have put everything in your wife's name." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand," Dottie confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Angel explained, "Many people play it safe by putting everything in their 
spouse's name so when they declare bankruptcy they have no assets to divide 
among their creditors." 
</P>
<P>
"That's very clever," said Dottie in her lilting Irish voice. 
</P>
<P>
"It is and it isn't," Angel admitted. "Sometimes when the guy goes bust, the 
marriage goes bust about the same time, and then the wife keeps the assets he 
turned over to her for safekeeping." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems unfair," Dottie muttered. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a saying in this country. Life and Chapter 11 are both unfair," 
Sheldon stated. 
</P>
<P>
"Can a person get out of Chapter 11?" Dottie asked. 
</P>
<P>
"He can if he pays all his debts and the bank gives him back his car," Donald 
told her. "Going into Chapter 11 and coming out again is what is known as the 
American Dream." 
</P>
<P>
Angel added, "The thing you must understand, Dottie, is not everyone who goes 
into Chapter 11 has the same lifestyle. The richer the bankrupt person, the 
easier it is for him to maintain the way he lived in the past. The poorer 
people in bankruptcy are poorer now than they ever were before." 
</P>
<P>
"Why do the rich bankrupt people live better than the poor?" Dottie asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the rich can keep up a front, and the poor are not permitted to. 
Besides, the rich can always count on someone giving them credit on the off 
chance that they might have their real money stashed away in Liechtenstein. No 
such hopes for the poor." 
</P>
<P>
Dottie told us, "Your Chapter 11 is much more civilized than the one we have in 
Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
"What happens in Ireland when you go broke?" Sheldon asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The plumber beats you up."

Critics Take Stand on Censorship: Members of the American Theatre Critics Assn. 
voted Monday to urge Congress to continue funding the National Endowment for 
the Arts without restricting the content of artistic expression. The ATCA, the 
only national organization of drama critics in the United States, issued a 
statement saying: "The American Theatre Critics Assn. strongly urges Congress 
to reauthorize the National Endowment for the Arts without restrictions on 
artistic content leaving its traditional fiscal and evaluative structure 
intact, so that creativity can continue to flourish in the United States." The 
statement was passed unanimously by theater critics attending the national 
convention of the ATCA held in Pittsfield, Mass. ATCA membership includes 
nearly 300 newspaper, magazine, television and radio critics throughout the

'Die Harder,' Born Earlier: The non-stop action in "Die Hard 2" may have been 
too much for Kami Core of Atlanta, Ga., who gave birth Saturday in the theater 
restroom. 
</P>
<P>
Core, 18, wasn't particularly concerned going to the theater since she wasn't 
due for almost two months. But about halfway through the thriller, Core began 
feeling labor pains. She went to the restroom, where paramedics were summoned. 
About 20 minutes later, she gave birth to Cortney Brion Samuels on the restroom 
floor. Core was to be released Monday from the hospital, but Cortney won't go 
home for another two weeks. GREG BRAXTON

Splitsville for Chong and Howell: C. Thomas Howell has filed for divorce from 
actress Rae Dawn Chong, citing irreconcilable differences after just over a 
year of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, who starred in "Soul Man" and "The Hitcher," separated from Chong on 
June 1, court documents said. In his petition, Howell, who lives in Los 
Angeles, asked the court to award him clothing, jewelry and personal items and 
"post-separation earnings, accumulations and acquisitions." The petition seeks 
a division of community property, but no spousal support. GREG BRAXTON

Songs and Violins Mark Stern's 70th: A who's who of classical musicians threw a 
70th birthday party Sunday in San Francisco for Isaac Stern, as 30,000 people 
turned out to pay tribute to one of the world's most famous violinists. Flutist 
Jean-Pierre Rampal and violinist Jaime Laredo were among those who performed 
with the San Francisco Symphony in a free concert. Mstislav Rostropovich, the 
conductor of the National Symphony, stole the show, dancing onto the stage 
wearing the heavy makeup of a ballerina, a wig and white tutu. GREG BRAXTON

ANTON TRIMS SOME FAT -- AND MAKES A HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his first official act as superintendent of the nation's second-largest 
school district, William R. Anton on Monday announced that he will give up the 
bodyguard-driver assigned to some of his predecessors and send him instead to 
be a security officer "for a school that needs it most." 
</P>
<P>
His announcement, an acknowledgement that the bodyguard's job had become a 
symbol of "administrative fat" to some critics, touched off some of the 
heartiest cheers of a morning filled with celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people jammed the courtyard of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's downtown headquarters to welcome the city's first Latino schools 
chief since shortly after California came into the union in 1850. Mariachis 
played and schoolchildren chanted "Viva Anton!" The crowd -- including dozens 
of employees and their families, former and present Board of Education members, 
business leaders, college presidents and the deans of education schools at 
UCLA, USC and Cal State Los Angeles, Anton's alma mater -- sent red, green and 
white balloons skyward as their new leader stepped up to the podium. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction "that a kid from the barrio of East Los Angeles can 
aspire and become superintendent," Anton, 66, who got the top job just days 
after Leonard Britton announced plans to resign when his contract ended next 
year, brimmed with characteristic optimism. He told well-wishers of a Spanish 
saying that "has been a guiding light for me throughout my career -- Si, se 
puede, which roughly translates into: Yes, it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
In acknowledging the many problems that plague the district, Anton, who will 
earn $164,555 a year, promised that his "highest priority will be to provide 
the educational environment which will result in marked (improvement in) 
student achievement for all students of the district. That must be our highest 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, board members heard a proposal for raising achievement test 
scores for the district's 610,000 students, increasing numbers of whom struggle 
with limited English skills or with poverty. The test scores of many students 
-- especially blacks and Latinos, who make up 16% and 62% of the district, 
respectively -- have remained low, opening the district to charges that it has 
done little to meet their needs. 
</P>
<P>
In asking the board to reassign his bodyguard -- provided since the 1973 
slaying of Oakland schools chief Marcus Foster -- Anton offered a gesture aimed 
at defusing criticism, particularly from the teachers union, that the district 
pampered its top administrators while the schools suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Calling for teamwork at every level, Anton said he would push for improved 
employee morale, more after-school child care with the help of community 
organizations, increased business involvement in the schools, improved 
efficiency in district organization and a unified drive for more money from the 
state and other sources. He also promised a more welcoming climate for parental 
involvement and pledged to expand the district's plans to allow more autonomy 
to each school and share decision-making power among teachers, principals and 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the biggest challenge before us is the critical need to restore public 
confidence in our enterprise," Anton said, calling for "aggressive and positive 
outreach to all segments of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Such enthusiasm, coupled with a thorough knowledge of the district honed in 38 
years of climbing the ladder from elementary school teacher to second in 
command to superintendent, will serve the district well, one of Anton's 
predecessors said. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Handler, who led the district from 1981 to 1987, said his former top 
deputy "is one of the most outstanding educators I know. . . . He made me look 
good." 
</P>
<P>
But it was another, much earlier schools chief who was on the minds of some at 
Monday's celebration: Latino civic leader Antonio Franco Coronel. According to 
historian Leonard Pitt's book, "Decline of the Californio," Coronel headed the 
schools in 1852 when they were still part of the city government of Los 
Angeles. Since the district was not created until 1854, Anton is listed 
officially as its first Latino superintendent. Years ago, Sal Castro, an 
activist teacher and now counselor at Belmont High School, gave Anton a 
portrait of Coronel, who also was a mayor of Los Angeles. That portrait has 
hung in Anton's office ever since, and he said Monday it will move with him to 
Britton's old office.

FATHER, TWO SONS KILLED IN FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
TRAGEDY: SECURITY BARS AND DOORS BLOCK THEIR ESCAPE FROM THEIR LONG BEACH 
APARTMENT. ELECTRICAL SHORT SUSPECTED AS CAUSE OF BLAZE.

<P>
Curtis Lyles spent his last seconds of life in a futile struggle to fight 
through ribbons of fire that filled his Long Beach apartment. First, he tried 
the locked steel security door, grappling for a key turned white-hot by the 
flames. Then, clutching his 4-year-old son in his arms, he staggered in a daze 
through the thick smoke, trying to reach a front window. 
</P>
<P>
It was no use. Neighbors and relatives, pressed back by intense heat and smoke, 
watched as Lyles stumbled to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
It would take firefighters 15 minutes to work their way through the fire to the 
pair, and by then both father and son were burned nearly beyond recognition. 
</P>
<P>
In the rear of the apartment, another son, Curtis Jr., was pulled from a 
bedroom where he had fought in vain to break through a steel grate covering a 
window. The 7-year-old would become the third victim of the Sunday night fire, 
dying later at a hospital of smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning after the fire, relatives, friends and neighbors huddled in 
groups in the central courtyard of the 18-unit complex near downtown Long 
Beach, staring at the scorched stucco and boarded-up front window of Lyles' 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to get out of the window," Annie Hunter, Lyles' sister, 
recalled, tears pooling in her eyes. "He was trying to do that and protect his 
baby at the same time. I guess there was just too much smoke and he couldn't 
see." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, who resides in an upstairs apartment in the same building, said she was 
asleep when the fire broke out at about 8 p.m., but was awakened by shouts. She 
found her own unit filled with smoke from the blaze below. Rushing downstairs, 
Hunter arrived just in time to watch her brother's last fleeting efforts to 
make it to safety. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and family described Lyles, 30, as a gregarious sort, a family man 
enthralled by his two sons. Curtis Jr. was very much like his father, seemingly 
always happy and smiling, Hunter said. Jamal, the youngest, had already 
displayed a love for music and could "sing any song on the radio," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A custodian at nearby Monroe Elementary School, Lyles was well liked by 
friends, neighbors and his supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just such a tragic thing," said Robert Williams, principal at Monroe 
Elementary. "He was a good employee, very well liked by students, parents, 
teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach fire officials said the steel window grates and security door 
represent a difficult paradox in the crime-ridden neighborhood where Lyles 
lived. Residents treasure the screens, which are ubiquitous throughout the 
neighborhood, because they represent a barrier against criminals. But the 
grates pose nothing but problems during fires. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not illegal, but it's times like this that we wish they were," Bob 
Caldon, a Fire Department spokesman, said Monday. "It's a (no-win) situation 
for these people. If they don't have the grates, they're subject to theft. If 
they do, they're subject to tragedy from fire." 
</P>
<P>
Security screens cover the rear windows of the apartment building and metal 
security doors are out front. Although Lyles' front window was not fitted with 
a steel security screen, flames nearby posed a barrier to escape, Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
Grates on the back windows are outfitted with bolts that can be released from 
inside to allow the security screen to open up, but Curtis Jr. probably was 
unable to perform the task, authorities speculated. 
</P>
<P>
Lyles' sister was upset about the security bars. "It just don't make sense," 
Annie Hunter said. "What good is it to have these security screens if people 
can't open them and get out? It ain't fair." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe an electrical short in a lamp set off the fire, which 
raced along the carpet and shot up the walls. 
</P>
<P>
They also said it appears there was no fire alarm in the apartment unit. 
Neighbors reported that the building's owner was careful to put in new 
battery-operated fire alarms when tenants moved in, but Lyles and his family 
had been in the building for more than seven years and they may have removed 
the alarms, Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
The building owner could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Lyles, the wife and mother of the victims, was out playing bingo when 
the tragedy occurred, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned home and learned that her family had been killed in the fire, 
she went into shock and was transported by paramedics to a hospital, Hunter 
said. She was treated and released, and by Monday was back at the complex, 
staying with relatives.

SUPERVISORS FACE INCREASED PRESSURE TO EXPAND BOARD;

<P>

<P>
Two high-backed leather chairs sit unoccupied whenever the five members of the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meet in chambers. 
</P>
<P>
The chambers were equipped with extra chairs in 1961, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn 
recalled, because officials expected that the governing body in the rapidly 
growing county would be expanded someday. 
</P>
<P>
But supervisors for years have resisted dilution of their power. And now that 
Los Angeles is the most populous county in the country, each supervisor 
represents about 1.7 million residents -- more than twice the population of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure, however, is mounting that could lead to board expansion -- the most 
dramatic change in county government in more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge last month declared that the existing supervisorial districts 
are illegal because they "impair the ability of Hispanics to elect a candidate 
of their choice." 
</P>
<P>
Two plaintiffs in the lawsuit hope to persuade the judge to order expansion of 
the board to nine members. 
</P>
<P>
And, although the board's conservative majority has opposed expansion, 
conservative Supervisor Pete Schabarum recently indicated a willingness to 
reconsider his position and possibly provide the swing vote to enlarge the 
board by two seats. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the Board of Supervisors has become a central issue in the voting 
rights lawsuit filed in 1988 by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the U.S. Justice Department. It 
alleges that the district boundaries drawn by the supervisors in 1981 prevented 
a Latino from being elected to the board. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon ruled that the districts are "too large for 
any one person to adequately represent." But he left it up to the supervisors 
to decide whether to remedy discrimination by expanding the board or redrawing 
the current five districts. 
</P>
<P>
He is conducting hearings this week on a redistricting plan submitted by the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
How well the supervisors represent their huge districts has been debated since 
expansion was first proposed in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors control a $10-billion budget and provide services to 8 1/2 
million people -- more than the population of 42 states. 
</P>
<P>
"The board's sweeping authority, the county's enormous budget, the supervisors' 
$94,344 yearly salary, with chauffeur-driven county automobile and the 
incumbent's significant job security, have prompted the observation that the 
post of Los Angeles County supervisor is one of the most desirable political 
positions in the country," a 1989 report by the California Commission on 
Campaign Financing says. 
</P>
<P>
However, most residents simply do not understand the role of county government, 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The job of a county supervisor in California has changed dramatically since 
1912, when the primary task was "to assure the delivery of food to market by 
maintaining key roads with snow clearance during the winter and watering down 
the dirt roads in the dusty summer months," said Hahn, a supervisor since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Today, county government affects anyone who ends up in court, calls the 
sheriff, uses a county hospital, spends the day at the beach, hears the 
symphony at the county-run Music Center, applies for welfare, complains about 
the accuracy of a supermarket scale, visits county-owned Marina del Rey or 
relies on a county flood control channel for protection from heavy winter 
rains. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member board was created in 1852. During a three-year period in the 
early 1880s, it was expanded to seven members. Since 1885, the board has 
remained at five members, despite the county's enormous population growth and 
the fact that it now covers 4,083 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
In California, all 58 counties are governed by five-member boards except San 
Francisco, which has 11 supervisors who run the state's only combined 
city-county government. 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles City Council has 15 members, each representing 200,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
And Cook County, Ill., the nation's second-largest county after Los Angeles 
County, has 15 commissioners. Each represented 353,193 people in 1986, about 
one-fifth as many as each Los Angeles County supervisor represented, according 
to J. Morgan Kousser, a Caltech history professor who prepared a report for 
plaintiffs in the current redistricting case. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich's 2,615-square-mile district, stretching from 
Pasadena north to the Kern County line and west to Ventura County, is twice the 
size of Rhode Island. Antonovich said that representing such a large district 
is "no more difficult than the governor of California (being) able to govern 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
But the plaintiffs in the redistricting case have argued that the huge size of 
the districts makes it difficult for candidates -- especially minorities and 
women -- to challenge incumbent supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kenyon agreed, saying the five-district structure "clearly provides an 
advantage to incumbents and requires significant financial expenditures to run 
a successful campaign." 
</P>
<P>
In a supervisorial race where a candidate must reach 500,000 voters, 
substantial campaign funds must be raised, said Richard Fajardo, an attorney 
for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a plaintiff in the 
redistricting case. 
</P>
<P>
"If a candidate for supervisor wanted to walk door to door and spend 10 minutes 
with each constituent it would take him or her over 50 years," the report by 
the California Commission on Campaign Financing says. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion has been proposed since 1935, when a citizens commission said that a 
15-member board would provide for better representation. But county voters 
rejected expansion proposals in 1962 and 1976. Since 1980, the present board 
has refused repeatedly to put the question back on the ballot. A proposal by 
Hahn to put the issue before voters again in November will come before the 
board July 31. 
</P>
<P>
By expanding the board to nine members, Hahn said: "We can create a Hispanic 
district, an African-American district and an Asian district that will give a 
clear voice to these rapidly growing populations." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors can approve expansion, without voter approval, to settle the voting 
rights case, according to county attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The board's three-member conservative majority of Antonovich, Deane Dana and 
Pete Schabarum has publicly opposed expansion, contending that bigger is not 
better. They have argued that an enlarged board, with perks and staff for each 
of the additional supervisors, would increase taxpayer costs and would be less 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum was prepared to join Supervisors Ed Edelman and Hahn in expanding the 
board to seven members to settle the redistricting case, the county said in 
legal papers. But the proposal was rejected by the plaintiffs because they 
claimed that the county plan fractured the Latino vote. 
</P>
<P>
During a federal court hearing Monday, Schabarum testified that he was willing 
to consider expansion under certain conditions, including a guarantee that the 
county will not be required to pay for the plaintiffs' legal bills of more than 
$2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates seeking to succeed Schabarum, who is retiring, have vowed to 
put a board expansion proposal before the voters regardless of the outcome of 
the redistricting court case. 
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief administrative officer, said that more 
supervisors would make the board more "ponderous and slow-moving." 
</P>
<P>
While the county's population has grown, the power of supervisors has declined, 
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the increasing number of cities in the county, from 45 in 1954 to 87 
today. 
</P>
<P>
When a neighborhood becomes a city, Dixon said, "the Board of Supervisors loses 
a great deal of its direct authority, loses land use planning, it loses the 
determination of who provides the services and at what level. And the people 
turn to their local city councilman." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors also lost power, Dixon said, because of 1978 voter approval of 
Proposition 13, which took away their ability to raise property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The power of supervisors is also limited because the state mandates many 
services that the county must provide, Dixon noted. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors still wield considerable power. They have some latitude in 
deciding how much money goes to health and welfare programs or the sheriff. 
They award hundreds of millions of dollars in county contracts.

TAPE RULED INADMISSIBLE IN TRIAL OF BRANDO SON; 
</P>
<P>
SLAYING: POLICE FAILED TO FULLY INFORM HIM OF HIS RIGHTS BEFORE TAKING 
STATEMENT ON SHOOTING, JUDGE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a stunning victory for actor Marlon Brando's son, Christian, a judge ruled 
Monday that a tape-recorded statement he gave hours after the shooting death of 
his half-sister's boyfriend is inadmissible as evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
The portly film star sat impassively, occasionally taking notes and ignoring 
the groupies who packed the courtroom, as Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler 
found that Los Angeles Police Detective Steve Osti failed to properly read 
Christian Brando his Miranda rights before questioning him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear error," Fidler said. "I will not allow that statement to come in." 
</P>
<P>
Osti testified that when he advised Brando that he had a right to remain silent 
and to have an attorney present during questioning, he "might have left out the 
part, 'if you can't afford one,"' the section that informs suspects that they 
have a right to appointed counsel, because he assumed his father was a rich 
man. 
</P>
<P>
The beginning of the tape, played in court, confirmed that Osti had indeed 
omitted a crucial part. Osti admitted further, under questioning by defense 
attorney Robert Shapiro, that he had not asked if Brando had a lawyer, or if he 
had the money to hire one, and thus, Fidler ruled, he had violated a 
fundamental requirement of the interrogation process. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro and co-counsel Gerald Uelmen, dean of the Santa Clara University law 
school, argued that the detective had taken advantage of Brando's state of 
mind, and hastened to get an account of the events from him before an attorney 
had an opportunity to advise him not to talk. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the way the hearing is proceeding," Shapiro said 
after the preliminary hearing recessed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent setback dealt the prosecution's case, a Los Angeles Police 
Department investigator told reporters outside court that Christian Brando made 
numerous other admissions that can still be used against him. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where you couldn't get the guy (Christian) to shut up -- he 
talked for three hours," Detective Andrew Monsue said. "Christian is a very 
talkative individual." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at the start of the court proceeding to determine whether the 
32-year-old welder should be ordered to stand trial for murder, the first 
police officer to arrive at Marlon Brando's gated Mulholland Drive estate last 
May 16 testified that the defendant had blurted out that he had shot Dag 
Drollet, 26. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Christian) stated that he didn't mean to shoot him," Officer Steve 
Cunningham testified. "He stated he didn't care for the guy a whole lot, but he 
didn't want anybody to be shot." 
</P>
<P>
Members of Drollet's family, who flew in from their home in Tahiti, were seated 
opposite Marlon Brando in court, neither acknowledging the other's presence. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said the elder Brando opened the front door and the officer asked 
the actor where to find his son. "He said, 'I don't have any idea where he is 
and I can't believe he shot him,' " Cunningham recalled. Christian Brando was 
found in the living room, seated on the floor with his half-sister, Cheyenne. 
</P>
<P>
"He had his arm around her shoulder and they were talking," Cunningham 
testified. "She appeared to be upset. . . . I could not hear her crying, but I 
remember she had tears on her face." 
</P>
<P>
After Cunningham handcuffed Christian Brando and they awaited detectives, the 
officer said, the suspect appeared relaxed and aware and started talking 
voluntarily: 
</P>
<P>
"He stated that it was an accident, that they were struggling over the gun, 
wrestling, and that the decedent had grabbed the gun and made it go off. 
</P>
<P>
"He stated that he had the gun under the couch, that he kept it (at the 
residence) for the family's protection . . . that he told the decedent to get 
off the couch," and that a struggle ensued in which it was unclear who was 
trying to shoot whom. 
</P>
<P>
The officer quoted Brando as saying that he and Cheyenne had gone out to dinner 
and returned to his father's residence, where "things got crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Tom Jefferson, however, contradicted the 
defendant's account, testifying that he found no signs of a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Monsue testified, was found lying on a couch with a lighter, 
rolling papers and a tobacco pouch in one hand and a TV remote control in the 
other. He had been shot in the face at close range. 
</P>
<P>
Later, attorneys argued over whether statements made by Cheyenne Brando to 
investigators suggesting a motive for the shooting should be admitted as 
evidence -- despite the fact that she is unavailable for cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have said that Christian became enraged when Cheyenne told him at 
dinner that Drollet had physically abused her. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne is hospitalized in Tahiti "under heavy sedation and both mentally and 
physically unable to travel," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors argued that her statements were admissible under a provision in 
Proposition 115, which went into effect on July 6 -- three weeks after the 
slaying. Such "hearsay" evidence was previously held inadmissible. 
</P>
<P>
Uelmen argued, however, that Proposition 115 could not be used retroactively 
and that the attempt to apply it was unconstitutional and "an act of 
desperation." 
</P>
<P>
Monsue acknowledged that Cheyenne's comments were "critical" to prove the 
shooting was premeditated. Prosecutors are seeking a first-degree murder 
conviction.

A mystery caller who has been harassing San Gabriel Valley women with telephone 
calls in which he claims to be holding their husbands at gunpoint and demands 
money for their release struck again Monday morning, Monrovia police said. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia Police Sgt. Ron Buck said a call received by a woman early Monday 
matched reports of other calls "right down the line." Buck said the man claimed 
to have the woman's husband tied up and gagged at gunpoint. The caller demanded 
money for the husband's return and insisted the woman call him "sir," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar calls have been received by more than 50 women in Altadena, Arcadia, 
Glendora, La Crescenta, Monrovia, Pasadena and Temple City.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN KILLED BY POLICE HAD HISTORY OF 
PSYCHOSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 69-year-old Los Angeles man, who was shot and killed Sunday by police in the 
Westlake district, had a history of psychosis and had recently learned his 
failing health had gotten worse, said an administrator at the retirement home 
where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Monteleone -- who allegedly threatened two Los Angeles police officers 
with a knife while he exclaimed, "Go ahead and shoot me. 
</P>
<P>
I have cancer anyway" -- had been refusing sedative medicine for about two 
months, the administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
Monteleone had been suffering from heart disease, glaucoma and an ulcer since 
he moved to the Grandview Retirement Home on 6th Street about a year ago, said 
Grandview director Charlene Prall. According to workers at the retirement home, 
a physician had told Monteleone about two weeks ago that he was suffering from 
cancer, Prall said. However, initial autopsy reports showed no sign of cancer, 
said Bob Dambacher of the county medical examiner's office.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EXPANDED SMOKING BAN PROPOSED FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education next week will vote on a proposal to ban 
smoking and other tobacco use on all district property -- including cars. 
</P>
<P>
The all-encompassing ban, proposed by board President Jackie Goldberg, would 
apply to people at everything from sporting events to faculty lounges to 
meetings of non-school groups at district facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Allowing adults, but not students, to smoke gives students the message that 
smoking is for adults, providing a powerful incentive for children to smoke," 
Goldberg said in introducing the proposal.

PLAN TO GO ON WITH TUNNEL JOB OUTLINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Engineers in charge of Metro Rail subway construction Monday outlined plans to 
work around a fire-gutted section of tunnel in an effort to keep the 
much-delayed project from falling further behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"If a fire had to occur anywhere in the (tunnel complex), that section causes 
us the least problems," said Bob Campbell, project controls manager for Ralph 
M. Parsons Co., Dillingham Construction Co., and Deleuw, Cather &amp; Co., the 
consortium hired to oversee Metro Rail construction. 
</P>
<P>
Fire of unknown origin July 13 gutted one of two, parallel tunnels under 
construction near Union Station, causing one stretch of the 750-foot long 
tunnel to collapse and blocking traffic on U.S. 101 through downtown Los 
Angeles for more than three days. 
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting of the Rail Construction Corp., the government agency which 
helps direct both subway and light rail construction in the county, Campbell 
repeated earlier claims that the fire should not cause further delays in 
overall construction of the 4.4-mile subway system. The $1.4-billion project, 
already months behind schedule, now is slated to open in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell told Rail Construction Corp. board members that it is possible workers 
could begin laying track on schedule in the undamaged tunnel in early November. 
They would by-pass the damaged tunnel while repairs are being made. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Kunz, deputy construction manager for the building consortium, said the 
heavily damaged northern section of the tunnel can be repaired by replacing all 
of the wooden supports and applying "shotcrete," a heavy-duty, air-blown form 
of concrete, to the tunnel walls. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, he said, the southern end of the tunnel was less severely damaged 
than first feared and may be repaired by replacing wood timbers and adding 
concrete grout. Officials still must decide whether to excavate or tunnel 
through the middle section, which collapsed in the fire, Kunz said.

WE'VE LOST A POLITICAL LEADER -- IN THE BEST SENSE; 
</P>
<P>
BRENNAN: HIS VISION, CHERISHING THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE COMMUNITY, WAS UNIQUELY 
AMERICAN AND WILL BE MISSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMUEL H. PILLSBURY, Samuel H. Pillsbury is a professor of law at Loyola Law 
School, Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news of Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr.'s resignation from the 
Supreme Court hit hard because its meaning was so clear. With President Bush 
likely to replace the most influential liberal justice with a conservative, the 
Supreme Court's role in American life will change. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan, whose work will always be associated with the achievements of the 
court under Chief Justice Earl Warren, agreed with Warren that at the heart of 
American democracy was a commitment to fairness, to an inclusive and moral 
community that only an unelected body like the Supreme Court could enforce. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan, like Warren, had an extraordinary and optimistic view of America. He 
believed that democracy meant one person, one vote. He believed that racism was 
a fundamental threat to American ideals. He believed that the government could 
enforce order without violating citizen privacy. And he embodied these beliefs 
in action -- in votes to require legislative redistricting, to require school 
desegregation, to deny the state the right to use illegally seized evidence in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
He believed that the Constitution protected a woman's right to choose whether 
to have a child. He thought that the First Amendment protected all kinds of 
speech, including flag-burning and sexually explicit expression. He believed 
that the value of every person precluded the state from taking a life, no 
matter what crime the individual committed. In recent years, these views made 
Brennan a frequent dissenter on the court, but his basic approach won a 
majority often enough to leave a lasting imprint on our law. 
</P>
<P>
To all this, many have protested: What gave him the right; why should unelected 
judges dictate to us on such fundamental issues? The answer -- the defense of 
Brennan's approach to justice -- is clear if we understand the special moral 
and political role of the court in American life. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court is inevitably a political body. Its nine justices are chosen 
by politicians and must resolve some of the most difficult issues of the day by 
majority vote. But unlike the rest of our political leaders, justices serve for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Life tenure and the precedential nature of law gives the court a historically 
unique role, one that requires it to look further into both the past and the 
future than elected politicians do. The court has the power and obligation to 
hold the nation to a higher standard than elected representatives can. 
</P>
<P>
The court engages us in a moral and political argument. It can dictate for a 
time, but we have the last word. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan and the court won the national debate over "one man, one vote," and 
they recognized the deep and special hurt of racial discrimination in our 
nation in decisions broadly accepted as to past practices, but still 
controversial as applied to the inequities of contemporary America. 
</P>
<P>
From these and many other decisions we can see that the court's brute power to 
coerce is frequently exaggerated; its persuasive power is what should impress. 
</P>
<P>
The court's ultimate test is the test of time. Within the span of a generation 
or less, the court must build a consensus for its decisions so that they will 
be followed by successor courts and respected by the public. 
</P>
<P>
And so the question of who should take Brennan's seat involves us asking what 
sort of people we are. Perhaps we are tired of the high-minded ideals that he 
insisted were the message of the Constitution. Perhaps we wish to leave even 
issues of basic principle to popular referendum. It makes for less heated 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush campaigned for a "kinder and gentler" America. Few public 
officials worked harder toward that than Justice Brennan. He never gave up on 
the ideal of community, a cooperative and moral undertaking of all classes and 
races, and never ceased working for it in both his public and his private 
lives. He had an extraordinary ability to see cases and the nation from many 
sides, demonstrating a flexibility of mind and a degree of compassion that few 
now on the court share. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan's view of the Constitution was controversial. In some respects he may 
have been mistaken. But his vision of the nation and its fundamental document 
was inspiring in the very best and most American sense, and I fear our country 
will be a colder, darker place without him.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
METS TAKE 3-0 LEAD BEFORE LOSING, FAIL TO GAIN GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For the last month the New York Mets have been poised to take over first place 
in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Pittsburgh Pirates, not playing exceptionally well, are still on 
top. 
</P>
<P>
When Bud Harrelson took over as manager May 29, the Mets were seven games out 
of first. But with Darryl Strawberry on a home run spree, the Mets Moved to 
within two games of the Pirates on June 23. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, they are still 1 1/2 games behind Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
They missed a chance to move closer Monday night at Philadelphia when they 
built a 3-0 lead for pitching ace Frank Viola (13-5). 
</P>
<P>
Viola, who was battling his control but had a no-hitter through five innings, 
fell apart in the sixth inning and the Phillies scored five times and outlasted 
the Mets, 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Two walks, an error and a fielder's choice gave the Phillies a run. Another 
walk filled the bases again. It was here that Dickie Thon got the first hit off 
Viola -- his first grand slam -- on the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe (Viola) was thinking of a no-hitter and got a little excited," Thon 
said. "He usually pitches me away and that one was high and tight, the kind of 
pitch I can handle. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in a jam and I was relaxed. I think he was just trying to throw a 
strike after so many walks. It was not his pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up only two hits in six innings, it was the third time in a 
row Viola failed to become the league's first 14-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
Former Met Roger McDowell, who has regained his touch out of the bullpen, saved 
the win for reliever Darrel Akerfelds (4-0). McDowell retired the last four 
Mets, two on strikes, for his 15th save. 
</P>
<P>
Viola's mild slump and Darryl Strawberry's big slump have contributed to the 
Mets' inability to take over first place. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry had a double, driving in a run and scoring one. But, he is only two 
for 23 in the last six games and has only one home run in the last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were ready to move ahead a couple of weeks ago," Harrelson said. 
"But, I don't see anyone jumping off bridges. We have been in position to make 
a move and haven't done it. We just have to do our thing." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, St. Louis 1 -- It's too late for a pennant drive and probably too 
early for a salary drive, but the Cubs are on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Maddux (6-9), who has struggled all season, gave up just a run and seven 
hits in 8 2/3 innings at St. Louis and the Cubs won their eighth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux beat out a chopper in front of the plate in the fifth inning to drive in 
Luis Salazar from third with the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
Willie McGee, extending his hitting streak to 16 games, singled in the Cardinal 
run in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
Although they are in fifth place, 13 games behind the Pirates in the East, the 
Cubs moved 2 1/2 games in front of the last place Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Pittsburgh 0 -- Dennis Martinez pitched a four-hitter and Tim 
Wallach drove in four runs at Montreal as the Expos once again roughed up John 
Smiley. 
</P>
<P>
Smiley (4-5) lost his sixth consecutive decision to the Expos, going back two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach's two-run single highlighted a three-run first inning that gave 
Martinez (7-7) more than just a working margin. 
</P>
<P>
Wallach hit his 17th home run in the third inning. In the seventh inning he 
singled in another run to give him 67 runs batted in, best on lead the club. 
</P>
<P>
"I always enjoy pitching in a big game," Martinez said after the third-place 
Expos moved to within five games of the Pirates. "I don't know. I guess I was 
born that way." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 9, San Diego 2 -- A return home didn't do anything to help the 
Padres. They lost their eighth in a row and are only one game ahead of the 
Braves, the last-place team in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis hit a two-run home run and a run-scoring single to lead the Reds, 
who increased their lead in the West to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who have won only three of 24 games, are 1-11 since Manager Greg 
Riddoch took over. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Browning (10-5) gave up both Padre runs and eight hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 3, Houston 1 -- John Smoltz pitched a five-hitter at Atlanta and the 
Braves made a 10-game loser out of Mike Scott, a 20-game winner in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who shut out the Mets last week, extended his scoreless string to 14 
innings before the Braves scored their runs in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Thomas hit a liner to left that umpire Fred Brocklander ruled left 
fielder Javier Ortiz trapped. A TV replay showed Ortiz caught the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Smoltz (7-7) singled and Lonnie Smith walked before Mark Lemke singled in two 
runs. DAN HAFNER

COSMONAUTS: ALEXI LEONOV AND VALERY N. KUBASOV PACKED A FOUR-DAY SCHEDULE WITH 
LOTS OF SHOPPING AND CROWD-PLEASING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stuffed animals and friendly Angelenos threw two Russian cosmonauts off 
schedule last week as nothing in space ever did. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Alexi Leonov and Valery N. Kubasov were scheduled to leave a Los 
Angeles hotel for Olvera Street when organizers of their visit noticed a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't get Alexi out of the hotel gift shop," said one anxious official 
rushing up to another in the hotel lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The organizer hurried to the gift store. "We have a better place to go. We have 
to get back to the bus," she told Leonov. But the contented cosmonauts 
leisurely signed autographs, posed for pictures and inspected stuffed animals 
and other items before departing. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping and schmoozing with Americans were big draws for Leonov, 56, and 
Kubasov, 55, as they spent four days in Los Angeles celebrating the 15th 
anniversary of the only joint U.S.-U.S.S.R manned space flight, the 
Apollo-Soyuz Mission in July, 1975, which entailed the linking of the two 
spacecraft. The two Soviets were joined by Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford and 
Donald K. (Deke) Slayton, two of their American counterparts on the joint 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
One hitch in the celebration/shopping spree came when a parking officer 
ticketed their small charter bus as they visited the Sharper Image in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The officer told driver Michael Christie, waiting in a yellow zone on Little 
Santa Monica Boulevard, that buses could not park on Beverly Hills city 
streets. When Christie said he couldn't move because his international VIPs 
would return momentarily, the officer wrote a $13 citation. 
</P>
<P>
But the parking ticket did not dampen the Soviets' passion for shopping 
</P>
<P>
At Olvera Street, Leonov and his wife, Svetlana, fingered beaded belts, leather 
coats and a San Francisco Giants baseball cap before selecting a ruffled dress 
with bands of red, white and green, the Mexican national colors, running 
through the skirt. Svetlana Leonov said the dress was for her 2-year-old 
granddaughter and happily displayed her picture. 
</P>
<P>
At N. N. Camera &amp; Electronics in Beverly Hills, Leonov and Kubasov bought 
Japanese cameras and Kubasov added a cordless telephone for outdoor use at his 
summer house near Moscow. Leonov spent $544 there and Kubasov $679. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the camera store, the cosmonauts and their wives entered a large, 
gleaming Ralphs market nearby in Los Angeles. Leonov, striding rapidly ahead of 
the group, said he liked the deli's aroma and shook his head in wonder at the 
varied fresh fish at the meat counter. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a supermarket like this in our country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rushing toward a display of potato chips, he fingered several large, fluffy 
bags before selecting a bag of the barbecue variety. Leonov nibbled them on the 
bus as the cosmonauts traveled to their next appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Because the cosmonauts' four-day schedule was packed with visits to museums, 
Disneyland and a luncheon of the World Affairs Council, Leonov said he did not 
have time to find everything on his shopping list: film for the heavy, 
16-millimeter camera he brought from the Soviet Union, bullets for his bear- 
and moose-hunting rifles or a hearing aid for his elderly aunt. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping was not the only American custom the cosmonauts seemed to master; the 
Soviets were crowd-pleasers as well. 
</P>
<P>
Leonov used a double-entendre in English to win over a crowd sweltering in 
96-degree heat one afternoon at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory mall in La Canada 
Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank you for giving us such a warm welcome to Los Angeles," he 
said, rolling his eyes toward the sun as several hundred spectators laughed 
appreciatively. 
</P>
<P>
Then Leonov, who has visited the United States more than a dozen times since he 
began training for the joint space venture, said, "The most impressive thing in 
the United States is the American people. (When we toured America) after our 
flight in 1975, our visit was not received as warmly and friendly as it was 
right now. Times have changed a lot. I think our country is much more 
understandable (to Americans) than it was." 
</P>
<P>
After short speeches the crowd surrounded Leonov, Kubasov and Stafford, the 
commander of the Apollo mission on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
The broad-shouldered but paunchy Leonov, who in 1965 became the first man to 
walk in space, signed autographs. He drew a dove beside his name for Amanda 
Clark, 8, of Altadena and pinned on his lapel a Russian-language button from a 
well-wisher reading "Let us march together." 
</P>
<P>
Slayton left the reunion before the JPL appearance and NASA did not send 
astronaut Vance Brand. Brand still flies space missions and belongs to a 
shuttle crew that is not expected to blast off before August. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmonauts' anniversary appearance, sponsored by the Aerospace Historical 
Committee of California Museum Foundation, was part of an 18-day tour that will 
also take them to NASA facilities at Houston, Huntsville, Ala., and Cape 
Canaveral and to Washington, D.C., and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Leonov and Kubasov first met their astronaut associates during training for the 
linkup of their orbiting spacecrafts on July 17, 1975, and their 18,000-m.p.h. 
flight around the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Today Leonov directs training for cosmonauts in Moscow, while Kubasov is deputy 
director of the Ingergia rocket program. They both live in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Leonov said that while the attitude of Americans toward Russia may have changed 
recently, the astronauts and cosmonauts developed life-long friendships 
unaffected by their nations' relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked together and practically lived together training for our mission," 
said Stafford, 59. "I was in the Soviet Union six times for six weeks at a 
time. They were in Houston five times for a month to six weeks. When we see 
each other, our relationship resumes right where it left off."

A DINNER 'CRUISE' IN MEMORY OF NEIL BOGART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memories of "The Love Boat" were frequently invoked as some 600 supporters of 
the Neil Bogart Memorial Laboratories boarded a new luxury cruise ship called 
Crystal Harmony for a black-tie dinner cruise Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Well, cruise may be stretching it. The ship did indeed leave its berth in San 
Pedro. And it did head west for about 10 miles at 25 knots. But then Capt. Kai 
Julsen instructed, "We will tie up at 9 o'clock." And it was straight back to 
"beautiful downtown San Pedro," as Dr. Warren Richards, head of the AIDS 
division at Children's Hospital, put it. (The three Bogart laboratories there 
are involved with research and care of childhood leukemia, pediatric cancer and 
AIDS.) 
</P>
<P>
So maybe it wasn't Mazatlan, but the sea air was genuine (and a few guests 
swore they started to suffer from seasickness). 
</P>
<P>
"This is really fun," said Allen Shapiro, vice chairman of Rastar/Indie Prod. 
</P>
<P>
"You're out. You're away. The last time I took a cruise I went from Tangier to 
Naples, but that was 20 years ago and I was younger and poorer." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the guests worked in the record and entertainment industries, including 
agents Bill Haber and Tom Ross, director Ivan Reitman, producers Irwin Winkler, 
David Foster and Julian Fowles, and attorney Allen Lenard, whose wife Marlene 
insisted, "This boat is everything 'The Love Boat' is supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
Many people had been friends of the late Neil Bogart, who was president of 
Casablanca Records and Filmworks. 
</P>
<P>
Bogart's widow, Joyce Bogart Trabulus, who co-founded the organization with 
Carole Bayer Sager seven years ago, said she expected to raise about $500,000 
at Saturday's event. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending were Neil Bogart's son Tim and daughter Jill Olive, his sister 
Bonnie Ermilio and parents Ruth and Al Bogart. Zaida Bedell chaired, and Ann 
Van Bebber served as co-chair. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner and entertainment by Whoopi Goldberg (who received the first 
"Children's Choice Award" from Patrick Swayze), Melissa Manchester and comic 
Taylor Negron, some guests spent the night on board the ship, which is Japanese 
owned and flies a Bahamian flag. 
</P>
<P>
Although it wouldn't be making any movement up or down the coast, that didn't 
put a damper on anyone's enthusiasm. "We would have mal de mer if it did and 
what fun is that?" said David Kelton, whose wife, Lenny, agreed.

TWO MORE APPROACHES TO SOOTHING COLICKY BABIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Infant colic affects about one in 10 babies, usually beginning by the age of 
four weeks. The baby cries or screams excessively, may draw up its legs and 
grow red in the face. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors believe colic may be caused by intestinal spasms. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, there has been no shortage of suggestions for frantic parents: 
Rock the baby. Offer a pacifier. Feed the baby. Give prescribed antispasmodic 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Here are two more ideas: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MOVEMENT AND DIET CHANGES: Dr. Kenneth L. Saul, Thousand Oaks pediatrician and 
chief of pediatrics at Los Robles Regional Medical Center, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 "Put the baby on a swing. Take her for a ride in the car. If that doesn't 
work, change the diet. If a baby is formula-fed, change formulas. If the 
formula is milk-based, switch to soy-based. If a baby is breast-fed, I advise 
the mother to avoid chocolate, caffeine, cabbage and spicy foods. If that 
doesn't work, I tell her to avoid dairy products entirely. This usually gives 
good results." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PREVENTIVE FEEDING: Dr. Janet McCormick, Long Beach pediatrician and staff 
pediatrician at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center 
</P>
<P>
 "Colic has to do with air swallowing. Minimize the air the baby swallows and 
burp out the air that does get swallowed. Here's how. Concentrate on more 
appropriate feeding techniques. Elevate the baby during the feeding so he or 
she is not horizontal. Hold the baby so his head and shoulders are at a 20- or 
30-degree angle. The air the baby swallows will rise to the top of the stomach 
and be burped out. Burp the baby three or four times during a single feeding. 
Throw away old nipples or enlarge the hole in the nipple so it is big enough to 
allow a slow, free flow of milk."

KITS CAN PREDICT OVULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Predicting the time of ovulation is important for the estimated 15% of American 
couples with fertility problems. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a new over-the-counter kit, Clearplan Easy One Step Ovulation Predictor, 
is being promoted as easier to use than several competing products. 
</P>
<P>
To use the home kit, which sells for about $25 in drugstores and supermarkets, 
a woman places the tip of a pen-sized test instrument in the urine stream. 
After five minutes, she compares the line in the results window of the 
instrument with the line in the control window. 
</P>
<P>
If the results window line is the same or darker than the control window line, 
ovulation is likely within 24 to 36 hours, according to a spokeswoman for 
Whitehall Laboratories, the manufacturer. If there is no line or it is lighter 
than the control window line, the woman resumes testing the next day. Five test 
instruments are included in each kit. 
</P>
<P>
It's worth a try, said Dr. Arthur L. Wisot, a staff physician at the In Vitro 
Fertilization Center at South Bay Hospital, Redondo Beach. "In general, most 
ovulation predictor kits are fairly accurate," said Wisot, co-author of "New 
Options for Fertility." 
</P>
<P>
Wisot suggests interested consumers try the kit for one menstrual cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't identify a clear color change," he said, "switch to a different 
brand. Different brands work differently for different people." 
</P>
<P>
He suggests that women avoid drinking an excessive amount of fluids while using 
the tests to avoid diluting the urine and altering the test results.

NEW NATO STRATEGY: MELD A MULTINATIONAL OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
GEILENKIRCHEN, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the crews that staff NATO's 18 American-made early-warning radar planes 
here, life on the flight line is unusually complicated. 
</P>
<P>
At other NATO air installations, the pilots and other personnel have had to 
worry only about air operations. But at this base, where there are people from 
a dozen different countries, there are other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
To cope with the plethora of languages, NATO officials have deemed English the 
common language, and last year crew members scrambled to enroll in 162 
refresher courses. 
</P>
<P>
Maintenance manuals have been completely rewritten; the original U.S. versions 
had been classified, with a prohibition against distribution to non-Americans. 
And last month, World Cup soccer had the mess hall up in arms. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, the Geilenkirchen base may face its toughest challenge: A female 
U.S. Air Force captain will take command of an all-male maintenance squadron 
that includes crews from some of Europe's most tradition-bound societies. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for all this is that Geilenkirchen, unlike other bases of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, which rely heavily on U.S. personnel and 
equipment, is truly a multinational operation. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new strategy designed to adjust NATO's operations to changing post-Cold 
War conditions, the base has crews from 12 different nations under a unified 
command headed by a West German general. 
</P>
<P>
Geilenkirchen is at the leading edge of what strategists say could be the new 
look and structure of NATO forces in the decade ahead. The 41-year-old 
alliance, struggling to maintain its military cohesion while defining a new 
political role for itself as the Soviet threat recedes, has embraced the idea 
of multinational forces as a politically palatable answer to a host of 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The main incentives for the shift are political. For many Western leaders, 
shifting to multinational forces is the ultimate expression of NATO's principal 
but unspoken objective: "To keep the Americans in, the Soviets out and the 
Germans down." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. defense strategists say a multinational structure will provide political 
cover for a continued U.S. military presence in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Under the multinational mantle, the United States may be able to keep as many 
as 75,000 troops in the western part of a united Germany for several years to 
come. And few analysts believe that the German public would tolerate them if 
they remained exclusively under the U.S. flag. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important, the creation of a multinational force would give West 
Germany the legitimacy it wants to take the first cautious steps toward 
deploying German troops abroad -- a development that would mark an important 
re-entry into the new world order. 
</P>
<P>
West Europeans watched apprehensively last year when a contingent of West 
German soldiers, operating as part of a multinational unit called Ace Mobile 
Force, took part in maneuvers in Norway for the first time in the postwar era. 
</P>
<P>
But the advantages are not all political. Pentagon officials hope the move 
toward multinational forces will shift more of the cost of defending Europe to 
Washington's allies and help to blunt growing pressure in Congress to pull U.S. 
troops out of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes, which were endorsed by NATO leaders at their recent 
summit in London, have strong political appeal, but military experts warn that 
they could spawn problems, the kind of problems that are bedeviling the 
Airborne Early Warning Force here. 
</P>
<P>
The communications equipment of allied nations sometimes uses different radio 
frequencies, and not all the weapons use interchangeable ammunition. 
Governments will have to devise common standards -- in some cases, even set up 
new organizations -- for buying, repairing and supplying equipment. And they 
will have to share military secrets that until now they have guarded jealously. 
</P>
<P>
There will be other problems, too: There are serious language and cultural 
differences. Women have different roles in each of the allied armies. In some 
countries, soldiers have been allowed to form labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if the multinational forces are to be effective, NATO's political 
chiefs will have to put aside conflicting national policies and agree to assign 
these units common military missions -- a high degree of unity that has often 
eluded NATO in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a cost to multinationality," Air Chief Marshal Anthony Skingsley has 
warned. He is deputy commander of Allied Forces Central Europe, the 
organization that probably will change most under the new initiative. "It 
doesn't come for free," Skingsley said, "and we're not going to get there 
without some hiccups." 
</P>
<P>
But the move will also spark some fundamental changes in the structure of the 
Western defense effort. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years, six separate NATO allies have stacked their forces 
along West Germany's 500-mile eastern border in a "layer-cake" formation. The 
result was nine interlocking national corps sectors, each operating as a 
separate unit but confronting the Warsaw Pact with an unbroken line of allied 
armies. 
</P>
<P>
Now, about half of the 26 once-hostile Warsaw Pact divisions that had been 
deployed along West Germany's border with East Germany and Czechoslovakia have 
been dissolved, including forces from those two countries and from Poland, 
Hungary and Romania. As a result, public support in NATO countries for massive 
defense spending has all but disappeared. Clearly, the "layer-cake" concept has 
grown stale. 
</P>
<P>
What was needed, NATO's politicians told their military leaders, was a new plan 
for the alliance's defense, something lighter, less costly and more politically 
acceptable to post-Cold War palates. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, what the NATO countries are trying to do is to turn the alliance's 
layer cake into a cinnamon bun -- a swirled confection of multinational forces 
that would be smaller and cheaper and offer the added sweetener of joint 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"Multinational forces are the flavor of the decade," a NATO planning official 
said. "The problems will have to be overcome, the soldiers will just have to 
get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts fret that while the cinnamon-bun notion may be tempting, 
baking it may cause some heat in NATO's military kitchen. To begin with, it 
isn't easy to run an army under policies that require international approval of 
individual missions. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Crosbie E. Saint, commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, notes that NATO's 
often-protracted debates over lofty political issues are not likely to 
translate easily into simple orders like "take that hill." 
</P>
<P>
"Coalitions are a real bitch," Saint said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many professional U.S. military men fear that integration problems and 
political haggling over specific missions will produce armies that are capable 
of dying but not fighting, capable of suggesting political solidarity but not 
deterring aggression. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to create a force that can't operate," Saint said. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts raise questions about how much money the new concept will 
actually save. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, agrees that the plan could eventually save billions, but only after 
years of heavy investment in common equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Peter H. Carstens, the West German who commands the Ace Mobile Force, 
says his own unit's experience shows that the cost of satisfying the 
communications needs of the new multinational forces could well double or 
triple under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, NATO members learned the hard way how difficult it is to 
subordinate political differences when the alliance tried to establish a 
multilateral force of ships that would have crews of mixed nationalities and 
carry nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as now, the prospect that Germans would have control of nuclear weapons, 
even in peacetime, spawned serious concern. Today, there is widespread 
acceptance that nuclear missions are too controversial and provocative to be 
conducted by a multinational force. 
</P>
<P>
But even lesser missions for multinational forces have run into roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, which are in a tense standoff over Cyprus, have placed 
conditions on their participation in the NATO force. When an airborne warning 
and control system (AWACS) plane is operating over one of those countries, its 
crew may not use radar to control warplanes in the other. 
</P>
<P>
Caution of a similar sort prompted NATO allies to circumscribe the role of the 
Ace Mobile Force. Often described as a "political" or "deterrent" force, the 
5,600-man AMF is designed not so much to fight a prolonged battle as to act as 
a tripwire, signaling to an aggressor that attacking it would trigger full 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
The AMF, designed for quick deployment on NATO's flanks in a crisis, can be 
deployed only with the unanimous agreement of all the participants in the 
force, as well as the host country -- a procedure that many believe could 
cripple its ability to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians would retain control down to the tactical level -- actual 
operations that most commanders consider their province. Decisions to attack 
could be made only with the approval of NATO foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of such concerns, many military voices, particularly American, have 
urged the alliance to limit such mergers to the corps level, coordinating the 
actions of two national divisions, which would operate as separate units. 
Strategists argue that this would minimize many of the differences between 
units. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that the more you gain in political benefit, the more you 
lose in effectiveness," said a senior U.S. official monitoring the venture into 
multinational forces. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Washington's ambassador to NATO suggested recently that the trade-off 
between politics and military effectiveness would be a key virtue of the new 
forces and that this should help convince the Soviets that NATO poses no threat 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets "should like the whole concept" of multinational forces, the 
ambassador, William Taft, said in an interview. "They will see that the chances 
of aggression from a multinational corps are very remote. The idea of trying to 
get a multinational force to move forward is something that just doesn't wash. 
It's hard to conceive of." 
</P>
<P>
For now, it seems as though the shift to multinational forces will not come 
quickly. Analysts point out that the AWACS plan here at Geilenkirchen was 
conceived in the early 1970s, established in 1980 and not raised to its full 
strength until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After 30 years in operation, another key experiment in multinationalism -- the 
Allied Command Europe Mobile Force, based in Heidelberg -- is faced with the 
continuing need to find ways to overcome national differences in equipment and 
military procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many analysts believe that as Western governments rush to reduce their 
troop levels, the remaining forces from individual countries may end up being 
too small for NATO to afford the luxury of maintaining separate national 
divisions -- and that this will force NATO into multinationalism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the time for nations involved to look at this strictly from the 
point of view of its military rationale," a West German defense official says. 
"Military effectiveness may not matter as much in the new situation."

PRISON PREGNANCIES: YOUTH AUTHORITY SAYS ISSUING CONTRACEPTIVES AT 
CO-EDUCATIONAL VENTURA SCHOOL WOULD MEAN CONDONING SEXUAL ACTIVITY. CRITICS

CAMARILLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Their jailers forbid intimacy beyond hand-holding, but male and female 
prisoners of the California Youth Authority's Ventura School have nevertheless 
paired off to conceive eight children in state custody since March, 1987, 
records show. The eighth baby is due in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo compound, which houses virtually all of the state's incarcerated 
female youth offenders, is the California Youth Authority's only co-educational 
facility. National authorities say it also is apparently the only youth 
facility in the United States where prisoners regularly get pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time it happens, I'm amazed," said Terry Cole, an 
obstetrician-gynecologist who has been making monthly visits there since 1981. 
"You would think that the authorities out there would have it figured out. But 
obviously, where there's a will, there's a way." 
</P>
<P>
Many outside specialists say major reforms are needed to solve the problem, and 
some decry the Youth Authority's refusal to distribute birth control devices as 
unrealistic. But Youth Authority officials discount the severity of the 
situation and say that aside from revised security procedures and possible new 
courses in sexuality and self-esteem, they expect to leave the institution 
largely as is. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo facility sits on a grassy plain and houses 610 male and 250 
female prisoners, who sleep in separate buildings but gather together for 
classes and counseling under the scrutiny of 450 staffers and a network of 
video monitors. 
</P>
<P>
The CYA's prisoners in Camarillo are guilty of offenses from misdemeanors to 
murder, with robbery the most common offense. Although their average age is 19, 
more than 100 prisoners there have been convicted of homicide. A 1987 survey 
found that 18% of the CYA's incoming female prisoners had given birth at least 
once. 
</P>
<P>
If an inmate 18 or older conceives a child while incarcerated, the Youth 
Authority recommends to the parole board that the prisoner's sentence be 
extended, said Kate Thompson, the facility's acting superintendent. Those 
extensions, Thompson said, often last six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
If the prisoner is under 18, Thompson said, "we refer that to law enforcement" 
and parents are notified. In two of the eight recent cases, Thompson said, the 
mothers were minors. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, arrangements are made for the prisoners' families to take over the 
infants, Youth Authority officials said. Others are put up for adoption. 
Abortions are available, officials said, but seldom chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Contraceptives are not available at the facility, nor are birth control pills, 
except to female prisoners complaining of irregular periods and those expecting 
to leave within three months. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, it would be an act of condoning their sexual activity in the 
facility," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
For critics of the Youth Authority, the pregnancies and absence of 
contraception raise a red flag -- one that could signal an AIDS threat or a 
prisoner lawsuit, and one that sets the institution apart from others around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The CYA can't have it both ways. If they're going to mix boys and girls, 
they're going to have to provide more education, and birth control," said Ellen 
Barry, director of Legal Services for Prisoners With Children, a San 
Francisco-based legal advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are sexually active," said Pat Marrone, who directs Allied 
Fellowship, an Oakland-based halfway house that takes some pregnant CYA 
prisoners. "It's not only that we need to prevent them from getting pregnant. 
We need to prevent the spread of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
No AIDS cases have been reported among CYA prisoners in Camarillo. But critics 
say state officials are inviting trouble, given the facility's many prisoners 
with histories of substance abuse or promiscuity, or both, and the lack of 
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't adequately supervise the kids, so not to give them birth control is 
such a head-in-the-sand decision," said Elizabeth Jameson, staff attorney for 
the Youth Law Center, a San Francisco advocacy group. Jameson added that, 
although she knew of no such cases so far, the pregnancies among minors could 
leave the state vulnerable to accusations of negligence and possible litigation 
by prisoners' families. 
</P>
<P>
"I was supposed to be getting interviewed for a play," said Piper Moore, 20, 
who conceived four months ago while in custody and is still a CYA prisoner. 
"The staff wasn't paying attention, so we just did it. . . . What do they 
expect?" 
</P>
<P>
Some of the pregnancies are premeditated, Moore said. "They want to get 
pregnant. They're young, and they got a lot of time, and they want to be 
pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
For officials at other juvenile institutions around the country, Camarillo's 
reality is an unfamiliar problem complicated by rare circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Washington, Idaho and Texas, where state facilities house youth 
offenders in co-educational populations of 100 to 300, authorities said they 
could recall no reports of prisoners impregnating other prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the American Correctional Assn. in Maryland said the same. John 
Zachariah, juvenile projects coordinator for the American Correctional Assn., 
called the Camarillo facility's size "a thing of the past," noting that it 
holds three or four times as many prisoners as many comparable institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Today," he said, "you will find very few institutions with more than 200 
capacity. It's better for kids and it's better for management." 
</P>
<P>
On their list of possible reforms, Thompson and her staff have included sex 
education classes, which Thompson said have not been offered for several years, 
if ever; a tighter system of passes for prisoners; separation of boys and girls 
in choir classes and other leisure activities; a more rigidly structured 
academic schedule; staff training sessions to improve security; new locks for 
all doors; and self-esteem counseling for female prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
On June 28 and 29, the state Commission of Juvenile Justice, Crime and 
Delinquency made its annual inspection of the Ventura School. The group's 
findings are not expected to be released for several weeks, but Commissioner 
Donna Clontz, who lives in Ventura County, said she did not expect the 
pregnancy figures to surprise commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Given the facility's population, she suggested, a record of just eight 
pregnancies in three years among 250 females may be "a good sign that 
everybody's doing what they're supposed to be doing."

JURY SELECTION UNDER WAY IN SALCIDO MURDER CASE;

BINGES.

<P>
As jury selection began here Monday, Ramon Salcido wore the same seemingly 
emotionless look he had upon his arrest for the slaughter of his family in one 
of the most heinous crimes in California history. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido, 29, short, somewhat chubby and pale from being in jail for the past 15 
months, was dressed in a gray pinstripe suit as the first 130 of 480 
prospective jurors appeared in San Mateo County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
As the trial opened, even his own lawyers acknowledged that there is little 
mystery about what happened early on April 14, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In a detailed and chilling confession, Salcido told how he slit his three 
daughters' throats, killing two of them, then murdered his mother-in-law, two 
sisters-in-law, his wife and his boss at the Grand Cru winery where he had been 
a warehouseman. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say it. We're trying to save his life," Sonoma County Public 
Defender Marteen Miller, who heads the defense team, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to persuade judges that Salcido's confession should not be admitted as 
evidence, Miller said he hopes to persuade jurors that they should spare 
Salcido's life, perhaps even return a verdict of manslaughter rather than 
murder. To this end, Miller will contend that Salcido was so insane after 
binges on cocaine and alcohol, and stressed out and depressed over financial 
pressures, that he didn't know what he was doing when he went on the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, an affable lawyer who takes an occasional chew of tobacco, is handling 
the highest profile case of a career that began when he became a law clerk in 
the Sonoma County public defender's office in 1961. He has been Sonoma's public 
defender since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
His opposition is Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Bumerts, 45, a veteran of 11 
years in the Sonoma County prosecutor's office. Bumerts, a former public 
defender, is trying his first death penalty case. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to have a death penalty," Bumerts said in an interview, "this 
is exactly the type of case it should be used for." 
</P>
<P>
Bumerts said Carmina Salcido, 4, the one surviving daughter, will not testify. 
Carmina is living with a family outside California. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 50 prosecution witnesses will be Robert Richards, father of Salcido's 
wife, Angela, 24, and grandfather of Sophia, 4, and Teresa, 1. Richards had 
driven off to work as Salcido allegedly arrived at the Richards' Cotati home. 
</P>
<P>
There, Salcido admitted, he murdered Marion L. Richards, 47, by bludgeoning her 
with a tire jack and stabbing her, then slit the throats of Richards' two 
youngest daughters, Ruth, 12, and Marie, 8. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection is likely to last through September, said Sierra County Superior 
Court Judge Reginald Littrell, who is hearing the case. The trial is expected 
to last at least six weeks, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
The case was transferred to San Mateo County from Santa Rosa after the defense 
contended that Salcido could not receive a fair trial in Sonoma County, where 
the murders occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said Salcido has spent much of his time in jail drawing pictures of his 
children that almost always show them smiling and happy. Miller said Salcido is 
in a state of "pathological denial" about the murders. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido was arrested on April 19, 1989, five days after the murders, in his 
hometown of Los Mochia, Mexico. He had traveled there to see his mother, and 
quickly was handed over to U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Miller argues Mexican authorities coerced Salcido into waiving his right to 
face extradition proceedings. The point is important, Miller contends, because 
Mexico, which does not impose capital punishment, could have demanded that as a 
condition of extradition Salcido not be sentenced to death. So far, no judge 
has agreed with him. 
</P>
<P>
As Salcido flew back to Sonoma County on a plane owned by cartoonist Charles 
Schultz and piloted by Schultz's son, Salcido told Sonoma County detectives how 
he methodically committed the murders. 
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, his boss -- and one of his victims, Grand Cru 
vintner Tracey Toovey -- had told Salcido early in the week that he was going 
to be fired. His wife was planning to leave him. He also believed he was not 
the father of their first child, Sophia. 
</P>
<P>
On the night before the murders, he had wanted to go to bars, but Angela left 
him with the children. He spent the night snorting cocaine and drinking 
heavily, he said in the statement. Then, with daughters in tow, he went looking 
for Angela. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to find her, he recounted, he drove to a dump near Petaluma early on 
Friday morning, April 14, 1989. Then one by one, he carried the children from 
the car and slit their throats with a fishing knife. The bodies of Sophia and 
Teresa -- and Carmina, who was clinging to life -- were found the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Still looking for Angela, he went to his in-laws' home. Once there, he decided 
to kill his mother-in-law because, he said, she knew he was not the father of 
his first-born daughter. After clubbing Marion with a tire jack in the garage, 
he went into the house and, using a knife from the Richards' kitchen, slit the 
throats of his sisters-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he went to his home in Boyes Hot Springs, where he found Angela. When she 
reached for the phone, he shot and killed her, then drove off, drinking 
champagne. Finally, he found Toovey, 35, and shot him. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, he called his mother, and told what he had done. She implored 
him to make his way to Mexico to see her one last time. Mexican authorities 
found him based on a tip from one of his sisters. As Salcido told police what 
had happened, a detective asked what he thought should be done to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to . . . the electric chair, or somebody kill myself," Salcido said. "I 
have to pay (for) what I do to your country."

ON CALIFORNIA: THE DAY THE STRAWBERRY BECAME KING

<P>
They came here last week, the strawberry moguls. They set up shop in an airless 
banquet room, did their business quickly, and slipped out of town. No one 
noticed except the manager of the hotel coffee shop, who spread some 
strawberries around the tables to make the boys feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, it was the quarterly gathering of the California Strawberry 
Advisory Board. What they did for two days was preside over a kingdom that they 
have come to rule as surely as Carnegie once ruled steel. These men own the 
world of strawberries. They represent a type of farmer/mogul that seems to 
exist only in California -- there also being tomato moguls, lettuce moguls and 
raisin moguls. 
</P>
<P>
You might ask, doesn't Kansas have its wheat moguls and the answer is yes, of 
course. But the Kansas wheat boys are forced to slug it out each year with 
Nebraska and South Dakota. The kind of California mogul I'm talking about 
doesn't slug it out with anyone. Anymore. All other competitors have been 
reduced to a minor annoyance. 
</P>
<P>
That's more true of strawberries than any other major crop, although it wasn't 
always that way. Just how the strawberry farmers clawed their way to the top is 
as much a California story as the discovery of gold. 
</P>
<P>
We'll get to the story, but first some strawberry facts: Three out of every 
four strawberries popped into someone's mouth in this country comes from 
California. The runner-up state is Florida, and it produces about as many 
strawberries over an entire season as California produces in one week. 
</P>
<P>
At peak season, the strawberry numbers for California are almost beyond 
comprehension. Growers here roll out 120 million pints every two weeks, or 
roughly enough to put a pint on the table of every household in America. 
</P>
<P>
We so often hear numbers like these in California that we become numb to them. 
But 30 years ago, the numbers looked very different. California ranked 10th in 
production, behind states like Tennessee and Arkansas. Strawberries were 
regarded here as a hobby crop. 
</P>
<P>
John Meichel rolled into Oxnard about that time, fresh off the boat from 
Germany, and decided to grow strawberries because there was no competition. In 
the entire state, about 350 acres were planted. "No one understood 
strawberries," he says, "No one knew how to grow them right." 
</P>
<P>
Back then, Meichel says, he botched it time and again. Bugs would get the 
berries, plants would die from too much water or not enough. There was mildew 
and root rot. Strawberries forgave no mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
That was when farmers made the decision that would turn them into moguls. They 
went to Sacramento and persuaded the state to establish the Strawberry Board. 
The board was a quasi-government agency composed of farmers who had the 
authority to tax every strawberry producer in the state. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the tax was a penny for every 12 pints of strawberries 
produced. The board collected the money and poured it into the agriculture 
departments at the University of California. Solve our problems, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, answers began coming back. Do this, don't do that. Try these new 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, the researchers made full use of the enormous, natural 
advantage of California. Back East, the peak season for strawberries was six 
weeks. Here, it could be stretched to six months. So they developed strawberry 
types that kept blooming again and again. Yields rose from 10 tons an acre to 
15 tons and then 25 tons. 
</P>
<P>
They also introduced the farmers to the world of chemistry. There were 
treatments for every kind of bug, so many treatments that strawberries are now 
regarded as the most chemically intensive crop in California. 
</P>
<P>
So the success of the California strawberry has not been without its cost. The 
strawberry moguls have become a target of the sponsors of Big Green, the 
environmental initiative, and the moguls definitely feel the heat. They spent 
half their time here looking at research proposals for new, benign bug killers. 
</P>
<P>
And there are other problems. Success has attracted an abundance of first-time 
farmers. So many new acres have been put into production that the old-timers 
predict a coming shakeout. 
</P>
<P>
But none of these men seriously thinks about quitting strawberries. They have 
the swagger and confidence of farmers who believe they grow the trickiest, most 
difficult crop on earth. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting ended, a vanload of moguls headed toward home. As the van 
passed fields filled with new squash, one grower gazed at the fields and 
remarked in wonder at their size. 
</P>
<P>
His friend in the van never bothered to look. "Any bozo can grow squash," he 
said.

<P>
The fighting erupted when the militants fired at Indian troops after crossing 
over from Pakistan into India's Jammu and Kashmir state, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At least six more people, including two Indian security men, were killed in 
three separate incidents across Kashmir, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Kashmiri separatists are fighting for independence of the Muslim-dominated 
region from predominantly Hindu India. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's deaths brought the total number of people killed to at least 838 since 
Jan. 20, when the government launched a crackdown on the Muslim separatists. 
</P>
<P>
About 65% of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are Muslims, making it India's 
only Muslim majority state. Nationwide, Muslims make up 12% of India's 880 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
Hindus account for 82% of the population.

All 79 opposition lawmakers resigned en masse Monday as the rival governments 
of South Korea and North Korea wrangled over a proposal to open their common 
border to free travel. 
</P>
<P>
Angry opposition lawmakers in the 299-member National Assembly demanded early 
elections to form a new Assembly and warned that President Roh Tae Woo is 
trying to use relations with North Korea to divert the public from worsening 
domestic problems. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea supported the resignations and urged a stepped-up struggle against 
the Roh government. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, the Roh government announced that it is willing to negotiate with 
Communist North Korea on conditions that the north is setting for opening the 
two countries' common border to travelers. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to open the border and realize grand national exchanges, we are ready 
to discuss any problems related to it," Unification Minister Hong Sung Chul 
said on national radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic speech Friday, Roh proposed that the common border be opened for 
five days in August on a trial basis, allowing people on both sides free 
travel. He also said open borders could lead to talks on unification. 
</P>
<P>
But North Korea sent letters Monday rejecting Seoul's offer to open the border 
and instead proposed expanded high-level talks on Friday. North Korea's 
official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo, reported the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The official North Korean party newspaper Rodong Shinmun said that South 
Korea's offer to open its border for free travel "is nothing but a trick." 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known if South Korea would agree to the expanded border 
talks. Seoul has rejected such talks in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In letters addressed to the South Korean government and opposition leaders, 
North Korea also demanded that South Korea scrap its anti-Communist national 
security laws, release prisoners jailed for promoting unification and allow 
South Korean dissidents to attend an Aug. 15 border rally sponsored by North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean border is one of the most heavily fortified in the world. More than 
1.5 million troops are deployed on both sides. There is no mail, travel or 
other communication between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae Jung, head of the opposition Party for Peace and Democracy, said his 
party welcomes efforts at opening the border but cautioned the government 
against using the issue for political gains. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Liberal Party, which controls two-thirds of the 
Assembly's seats, said the resignations will not be immediately accepted.

INDIA'S LEADER, VISITING MOSCOW, GETS ASSURANCE ON FUTURE TRADE

The Soviet Union assured India on Monday that trade between the two countries 
will not suffer as a result of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic 
reforms, Indian officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister V .P. Singh, at the start of a four-day visit to Moscow, 
held talks with Gorbachev and Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov on 
strengthening economic ties up to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow is India's main arms supplier and a key trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
Singh is on his first visit to Moscow since defeating Rajiv Gandhi's Congress 
Party in elections last November. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian officials said Ryzhkov assured Singh that the Soviet Union is not 
neglecting its ties with India, Moscow's most influential Asian ally. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides reaffirmed in a statement their commitment to ridding the world 
of nuclear weapons, diverting resources from arms to development, protecting 
the environment and creating new global security structures. 
</P>
<P>
"More than at any other previous moment in recent history, mankind has the 
prospect of building a new structure of cooperation and brotherhood among 
nations and peoples," it said. 
</P>
<P>
"India and the Soviet Union are determined to contribute constructively and 
vigorously to the attainment of this goal," the statement added.

SOVIET UNION: LEADERS FACE CITIZENS' TOUGH QUESTIONS. THE GOAL IS TO FORCE 
ALOOF FIGURES TO BE RESPONSIVE.

"Politburo: The TV Show" made its debut on state-run television Monday night 
with a high-powered cast and almost everything else a civic-minded Soviet 
viewer could want. 
</P>
<P>
It had Phil Donahue-like suspense as the Communist Party's new No. 2 official, 
put under the klieg lights before a nationwide audience, was asked point-blank 
whether he is a relative of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's wife, Raisa. (He 
said he isn't.) 
</P>
<P>
There was emotion, as the highest-ranking woman in the Communist Party 
expressed compassion for mothers whose sons have been sent to the Caucasus 
region to quell ethnic violence there. 
</P>
<P>
Even a hint of soap opera-type scandal intruded, as the Kremlin high and mighty 
talked about whether they and their children get special privileges not 
available to the masses. (They said they don't.) 
</P>
<P>
For the Communist Party, which has taken its share of hits from the new 
openness in mass media, the premiere of what was officially called "Political 
Dialogue: Who's Who" was a 90-minute televised opportunity to show citizens 
from Siberia to Smolensk that the new breed of party official does care. 
</P>
<P>
Four members of the Politburo and Secretariat elected at this month's party 
congress sat behind a horseshoe-shaped table to answer questions from viewers 
relayed by moderator Igor S. Fesunenko, and they seized the occasion to do some 
image shaping. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all come up though the work collectives; we understand life," said 
Valentin A. Kuptsov, party secretary now in charge of forging links with other 
emerging, potentially rival political parties. Communist officials, he was 
saying, are not bureaucrats and know firsthand what it's like to work with 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
The "Who's Who" show, slated to be the first in an occasional series, opened up 
the once-remote and untouchable Kremlin figures to questions from their 
countrymen that could be very tough and that bared the deep suspicions about 
the leadership that some harbor here. 
</P>
<P>
It was another step in Gorbachev's effort to force Soviet officialdom to be 
responsive, but it also gave the 18-million-member party a chance to shore up 
its standing at a time when it is losing members and even party polls show its 
influence is waning -- and when it is being forced to compete for votes. 
</P>
<P>
One Moscow TV watcher specifically wanted to know whether Vladimir A. Ivashko, 
the party's new second-in-command, had gotten where he is because of nepotism 
-- more precisely, because of purported blood ties to Raisa Gorbachev, who like 
him spent her childhood in the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't turn my back on any of my relatives," the 58-year-old Ivashko quipped, 
smiling gamely at a question few would have dared ask a few years ago and that 
in any case would never have been heard on TV. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that he has no relatives in Moscow, including Mikhail and 
Raisa Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
If a star emerged from the premiere of "Who's Who," it was new Politburo member 
Galina V. Semyonova, the only woman in the top party institutions. For the past 
nine years, the journalist from Smolensk has been editor in chief of the 
magazine Krestyanka (Peasant Woman) and clearly prefers plain talk. 
</P>
<P>
"No slogans and empty promises," she vowed to viewers. 
</P>
<P>
In charge of a new party portfolio on women's affairs, Semyonova, 53, promised 
that she will regularly receive callers in her office and that such "reception 
days" will be announced beforehand in the press. 
</P>
<P>
That, too, will be a great contrast to the typical remoteness of party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
As "Who's Who" wore on, scraps of paper piled up on the table in front of 
Semyonova recounting sad stories telephoned in by Soviet women: mothers whose 
sons serve in army or police units in violence-torn Azerbaijan and Armenia, 
women whose children are invalids, a 73-year-old who never leaves her 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can do is express my sympathy," the silver-haired Semyonova said at one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Though "Who's Who" premiered one week after Gorbachev signed a presidential 
decree freeing state-run television and broadcasting from the party's control, 
the first guest list was a reminder that the powers that be haven't changed, as 
least for now. 
</P>
<P>
Ivashko, Kuptsov, Semyonova and party ideologue Alexander S. Dzasokhov were 
invited -- in lieu of non-Communists -- because the party "is the most 
organized, mightiest political force of the country," said Fesunenko, answering 
viewers' questions about whether rival parties would also be given air time in 
weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that Fesunenko was in awe of the new party leaders. 
Answering a viewer's question about whether his children received some sort of 
privileges because of his job, Ivashko said no. 
</P>
<P>
Fesunenko persisted, asking if they didn't have their own Chaika limousines. 
</P>
<P>
No, no Chaikas, Ivashko said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe, but that's the way it is," said Fesunenko with a smile. 
For at least one viewer, there seemed to be a hint of wry incredulity in the 
remark.

BUSH PLANS DAILY SESSIONS ON DEFICIT; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: HE IS EAGER TO STRIKE A DEAL BEFORE CONGRESS' AUGUST VACATION. TOP 
LAWMAKERS ARE SKEPTICAL IT CAN BE DONE THAT QUICKLY.

<P>
Amid signs of a possible thaw in the frozen budget talks, the White House 
announced Monday that President Bush will meet daily this week for "hard 
bargaining" with top congressional leaders over the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a period of very intense negotiations," White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said, "so they felt the leadership should get together and do some 
hard bargaining to see if we can't get it resolved." 
</P>
<P>
The White House is particularly eager to obtain an agreement before early 
August, when Congress leaves for a month-long vacation, but top lawmakers 
remain skeptical that a final deal can be struck that quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional aides said that differences between the Democrats, who control 
Congress, and the White House have narrowed considerably but that major 
disputes remain over taxes, defense spending and reform of the budget process. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, congressional Republicans expressed growing frustration over having 
been excluded from the numerous behind-the-scenes talks that have been under 
way recently between Administration officials and top Democratic lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
House Republicans already have lined up against any increase in taxes, largely 
undercutting their ability to influence the details of a budget agreement. Now, 
however, more-cooperative Senate Republicans are also becoming upset over the 
White House tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Bush plans to meet with the five top congressional leaders -- three Democrats 
and two Republicans -- for breakfast today before flying to Philadelphia and 
New York for political speeches. 
</P>
<P>
The morning sessions are expected to continue for the rest of the week, with a 
larger group of budget negotiators meeting in the afternoon to work on fleshing 
out details of a deficit-reduction agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to . . . exchange ideas and approaches," House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.) said Monday. "We do not intend to make agreements outside the 
summit group." 
</P>
<P>
Bargainers already have agreed informally on the broad outlines of a 
deficit-reduction plan that would cut roughly $50 billion from next year's 
estimated budget gap of $169 billion. 
</P>
<P>
According to aides, lawmakers expect to extract roughly $10 billion to $11 
billion in savings from benefit programs such as Medicare, pensions and farm 
subsidies; $10 billion to $12 billion from the Pentagon; $1 billion to $3 
billion from nondefense programs, and $20 billion to $27 billion from higher 
taxes and user fees. 
</P>
<P>
But the budget group remains mired in disputes over which measures it should 
recommend to reach those targets -- for example, whether to rely mainly on 
Medicare savings to reduce the cost of benefits or to go after the politically 
sacrosanct Social Security program. 
</P>
<P>
Another key difference between the White House and Democrats centers on taxes. 
Bush Administration officials have been insisting on a cut in capital gains 
taxes, but so far have been unwilling to accept higher income tax rates for 
upper brackets, which the Democrats are demanding as a quid pro quo. 
</P>
<P>
One reason that both sides are pressing for an agreement is to avoid cuts of 
more than $100 billion that otherwise would be mandated by the Gramm-Rudman 
deficit-reduction law, if it is not changed. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Congress will have to consider raising the ceiling on the national 
debt before it leaves for its summer vacation in early August -- a deadline 
that could prod negotiators into making enough progress to ward off crippling 
amendments to the debt-limit bill. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Foley, other lawmakers scheduled to attend the White House breakfast 
sessions are House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), House Minority 
Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). Joining Bush from the 
Administration will be White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu; Richard G. 
Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady.

NOMINEE SEARCH BEGAN MONTHS AGO; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN EVALUATING THE CANDIDATES' WRITINGS 
AND BACKGROUNDS. MANY OFFICIALS HAD LAST-MINUTE SUGGESTIONS.

<P>
As soon as Justice William J. Brennan Jr. announced his resignation, the calls 
started pouring into the White House and the Justice Department, where about 20 
attorneys were sifting through the legal opinions and writings of potential 
nominees. 
</P>
<P>
In what one Justice Department official recalls as "a classic case," a GOP 
congressman called the White House to boost the prospects of a district court 
judge he had helped put on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
A decision on that candidate didn't take long, the official said, because the 
prospect had already been rejected when he sought elevation to a circuit court 
of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's choice of Judge David H. Souter was made from a final list of 
12 to 15 possibilities, two-thirds of them present or former judges. The 
process of finding a nominee actually began in March or April of 1989 and 
included a careful look at close to 100 people. Their legal opinions, speeches 
and other personal data had been under review by about six Justice Department 
lawyers since then, one participant said. 
</P>
<P>
Some jurists were so prolific that the reviewers had to wade through more than 
200 opinions per candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the candidates had gone through full FBI field checks when they 
ascended to other judicial posts, but none has been checked out by the FBI in 
connection with the Supreme Court appointment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to focus on the final 12 to 15 flowed from a Saturday morning 
White House meeting Bush had with his counsel, C. Boyden Gray, Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, a Justice Department 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the groundwork, which began in early 1989 when Bush requested the 
work from Gray and Thornburgh, the team of attorneys and aides worked 
throughout Saturday until well after midnight and then returned to the Justice 
Department early Sunday, where some remained until 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Operating mainly out of the law library down the corridor from the attorney 
general's office on the Justice Department's fifth floor, lawyers updated the 
summaries that had been done on the prospects -- some untouched since last 
fall. Other attorneys took to the phones to check on last-minute suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
"The phones were ringing off the hook," one participant said. "We did take a 
look at them. But it was hard to add any serious candidates over the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Some on the final list -- Solicitor Gen. Kenneth W. Starr and Judge Patrick E. 
Higginbotham of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, for example -- did not 
require any updating. Starr had stepped down from the appellate court here to 
become the government's chief advocate before the high court, with his office 
down the hall from Thornburgh's. 
</P>
<P>
Higginbotham had been considered for earlier Supreme Court vacancies in the 
Ronald Reagan Administration, so both men were well known to the evaluators.

LAWMAKERS' REACTION TO BUSH CHOICE FAVORABLE BUT CAUTIOUS; 
</P>
<P>
SENATE: FEW KNOW MUCH ABOUT SOUTER'S RECORD. HOWEVER, MANY SEE RUDMAN'S 
ENTHUSIASTIC ENDORSEMENT AS A PLUS.

<P>
Although few senators had ever heard of David H. Souter before Monday, early 
signs were favorable that his nomination to the Supreme Court would be approved 
by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
A big plus for him is the strong backing of widely respected Sen. Warren B. 
Rudman (R-N.H.), who helped bring Souter to President Bush's attention and 
lavished praise on his longtime friend throughout the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
"To know him is to be enormously impressed," Rudman told reporters in the 
Senate radio-TV studio shortly after Bush's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Rudman said senators will find Souter to be "a classic conservative 
intellectual. . . . He cannot be characterized as an ideologue in any way, 
shape or form." 
</P>
<P>
"I would be very surprised if there would be serious opposition," Rudman said. 
"There is no chink in his personal life. He does not belong to any organization 
that I know of. He works too hard." 
</P>
<P>
Overhearing Rudman's remarks, Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) -- a liberal 
who would be likely to lead any attack against a conservative nominee -- 
stepped to the microphones and said: "This senator has heard nothing negative. 
I have certainly heard he has a very strong, positive record." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), a moderate who has been a swing vote on 
previous Supreme Court nominations, said that Souter "appears to be very, very 
capable" and probably is headed for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Influential conservative Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) also said he liked 
Souter's credentials and, like Metzenbaum, was impressed with Rudman's glowing 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence that the President made an excellent choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hatch and others said they knew very little about Souter's record 
and views, especially on pressing issues such as abortion. Several Democrats 
and Republicans said they expected the Senate Judiciary Committee to be more 
penetrating than it has been in the past in seeking to determine the views of 
court nominees. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pivotal appointment," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.). "I don't 
think there have been many times since the New Deal that the President has had 
an opportunity to shape the Supreme Court like he has now." 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Leahy said: "I would hope we would 
not have a rush of members of the U.S. Senate saying they would vote for or 
against Judge Souter. . . . We should have the hearings, hear those for or 
against him and vote the issue up or down." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Leahy said questions likely would be phrased to include abortion rights 
as a topic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be naive to think that Roe vs. Wade in one form or another is 
not going to be part of a lot of questions, interestingly enough, with the 
desire to know about that coming from both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a lot more known about him, I guarantee you that." 
</P>
<P>
Groups on both sides of the controversial abortion issue expressed trepidation 
about the lack of knowledge they have of Souter's views on the subject. Several 
abortion rights leaders demanded that senators press him hard at confirmation 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a terrible injustice to confirm any nominee without knowing he is 
committed to protecting fundamental civil rights, including the right to 
choose" an abortion, said Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights 
Action League. "A nominee cannot be allowed to duck this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph M. Scheidler, head of the Pro-Life Action League, said that "we're 
trying to find out stuff about" Souter. "We've been calling people all over. I 
don't even have enough suspicion to be nervous. I'm kind of in shock." 
</P>
<P>
However, at least one conservative group knew enough to be pleased. "President 
Bush has taken the first step in repairing the split between himself and the 
conservatives, his most important constituency," said Richard A. Viguerie, 
chairman of United Conservatives of America. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement made without elaborating, Viguerie said: "This Supreme Court 
appointment leaves conservatives with smiles on their faces. President Bush 
recognized that he had a problem with conservatives, and he did something about 
it. Conservatives have given thumbs up." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) served notice that the Senate 
will take a close look, but promised "a prompt and fair process." He called 
Souter "a respected member of the U.S. Court of Appeals" and noted that his 
prior service as New Hampshire's attorney general and as a member of that 
state's Supreme Court "provides valuable legal experience." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) reserved 
comment until today. But several committee members said they expected that 
hearings on the nomination would begin as soon as Congress returns from its 
August recess shortly after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any senator who wants to delay the nominee for the sake of 
delay," Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
Like nearly every other member of the Judiciary Committee, Hatch had no 
recollection of Souter passing through the committee en route to being approved 
for the appeals court last spring. But in the clubby atmosphere of the Senate, 
what could count most in Souter's favor is Rudman's personal endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people have a great deal of knowledge about Souter," Hatch said. 
"I have a great deal of confidence in Sen. Rudman. He talked about his academic 
credentials and said he was a good person and a good lawyer. I was impressed 
with what he said." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch earlier had dismissed speculation that he himself might be tapped by 
Bush, saying: "I irritate a lot of people in the Administration." He said then 
that he thought that Bush might pick a woman. But after the announcement, Hatch 
said he suspected that Bush would choose someone who did not have a record that 
could be attacked. 
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee's ranking Republican, Strom Thurmond from South 
Carolina, expressed disappointment that the nominee was not from the South. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not my choice," Thurmond said. "There is nobody on the court from the 
South. The South constitutes one quarter of the nation and ought to have at 
least one justice." 
</P>
<P>
Several liberal Democrats said they would seek Souter's views on abortion, 
civil rights and First Amendment issues. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said: "The Judiciary Committee and the full 
Senate have a responsibility to determine whether he possesses a strong 
commitment to the fundamental values of the Constitution and Bill of Rights 
that . . . will profoundly affect the lives and rights of all Americans."

Here is the opening statement President Bush made Monday when he announced that 
he will nominate U.S. Appeals Court Judge David H. Souter of New Hampshire to 
the Supreme Court to replace the retired William J. Brennan Jr.: 
</P>
<P>
My oath to the Constitution charges me to faithfully execute the office of 
President, and to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the 
Constitution of the United States. Few duties are more important to discharging 
that obligation than my responsibility under Article 2, Section 2 of our 
Constitution, to select from among all possible choices one nominee to fill the 
vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The task of narrowing the selection to one highly qualified jurist committed to 
the rule of law and faithful to the Constitution could never be easy. But I 
found it enormously satisfying; my choice will serve the court and the 
Constitution well. 
</P>
<P>
I'm most pleased to announce that I will nominate as associate justice of the 
U.S. Supreme Court a remarkable judge of keen intellect and the highest 
ability, one whose scholarly commitment to the law and whose wealth of 
experience mark him of first rank -- Judge David Souter of the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the 1st Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Souter, I believe with all my heart, will prove a most worthy member of 
the court. His tenure as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the state 
of New Hampshire, as attorney general of that state, and more recently as a 
federal appeals judge, unquestionably demonstrates his ability, his integrity, 
and his dedication to public service. And he has a keen appreciation of the 
proper judicial role rooted in fundamental belief and separation of powers and 
the democratic principles underlying our great system of government. 
</P>
<P>
Let me pay tribute, too, to the justice whose retirement from the court created 
the vacancy, Justice William Brennan. His powerful intellect, his winning 
personality and, importantly, his commitment to civil discourse on emotional 
issues that at times tempt uncivil voices have made him one of the greatest 
figures of our age. No one can question his dedication to the nation and the 
energy that he has brought to his high office. His retirement is marked by the 
dignity and honor that characterized his 34 years of service on the bench. And 
I told him the other day, when I talked to him, of the respect that Mrs. Bush 
and I have for him for his wonderful service. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing to nominate Judge Souter, who, like Justice Brennan, is largely a 
product of the state court system, I have looked for the same dedication to 
public service and strength of intellect exemplified by Justice Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
My selection process was not geared simply to any legal issue. It is not 
appropriate in choosing a Supreme Court justice to use any litmus test. And I 
want a justice who will ably and fairly interpret the law across the range of 
issues the court faces. Our country serves as a model for the world at a time 
of special significance, and I stressed within the White House, to the attorney 
general, that our process could not be dominated by politics or special 
interests. And I believe that we've set a good example of selecting a fair 
arbiter of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Souter will bring to the court a wealth of judicial experience on the 
Supreme Court of his state and, before that, as a state trial court judge. 
Prior to his appointment to the state bench he was attorney general of the 
state of New Hampshire. Judge Souter is a graduate of the Harvard Law School, 
Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Harvard College. He was also a Rhodes Scholar. 
</P>
<P>
My respect for his outstanding record led me earlier this year to nominate him 
to his present position on the court of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate unanimously confirmed him to that position because of his 
exceptional qualities and his experience. 
</P>
<P>
His opinions reflect a clean intellect -- keen intellect, as well as wise 
balance between the theoretical and practical aspects of the law. Judge Souter 
committed to interpreting, not making the law. He recognizes the proper role of 
judges in upholding the democratic choices of the people through their elected 
representatives with constitutional constraints. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Brennan's retirement took effect last Friday. The court is now reduced to 
eight members. It is important to restore the bench to full strength by the 
first Monday in October, when the court begins its 1990 term. 
</P>
<P>
I look forward to presenting Judge Souter's nomination to the Senate as quickly 
as possible, and I look forward as well to a fair and expeditious confirmation 
process.

SUIT SEEKS TO FORCE STATE TO PAY SPECIAL SALES TAX FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: AGENCIES IN 2 COUNTIES CLAIM THAT LOCAL REVENUE FUNNELED THROUGH THE 
STATE SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE DEADLOCK.

<P>
Claiming that their revenues have become hostage to a long-running state budget 
crisis, two of the 15 counties that levy special local sales taxes asked a 
state judge Monday to order the release of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed in Sacramento, the San Diego County Regional Transportation 
Commission, the Santa Clara County Transit District and the Santa Clara County 
Traffic Authority argued that local revenues funneled through the state should 
not be affected by the Legislature's failure to reach agreement on a budget. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing here subject to legislative appropriation that we can see, so 
how can a state budget that governs state money hold up our check?" asked 
Barney Allison, a partner in the Los Angeles law firm Nossaman, Guthner, Knox 
&amp; Elliott, which filed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Allison said a decision favoring the two counties would pave the way for all 15 
counties -- including Los Angeles -- that levy the transportation tax to seek 
immediate disbursement of their funds. A ruling is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
The State Board of Equalization collects an extra 1 cent in sales tax in San 
Diego and Santa Clara counties on top of the 6 1/4% sales tax the state levies. 
In Santa Clara, the local sales tax goes for transportation, while San Diego's 
is divided between transportation and jails. 
</P>
<P>
Once collected, the local revenues are turned over to state Controller Gray 
Davis who disburses them to the counties monthly. But on July 9, Davis notified 
the counties that he would have to withhold the payments until a new state 
budget is adopted. Democrats and Republicans in the Legislature have been 
unable to reach agreement on a tax and spending plan for the fiscal year, which 
began July 1. Once the fiscal year started, Davis said he "would lack legal 
authority to make certain payments" unless a budget were adopted by the 
Legislature and signed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has already been ordered by federal and state judges to release $688 
million in medical and social service payments as a result of three lawsuits by 
nursing homes, welfare recipients and in-home care workers. Federal and state 
courts are expected to rule today on a request by state employees for an order 
releasing paychecks that were held up at mid-month. 
</P>
<P>
But Wayne Sink, director of finance and administration for the San Diego Assn. 
of Governments, which also sits as the county Regional Transportation 
Commission, said local governments are worried that the delays could affect 
bond ratings and may also cause them to lose interest payments on the sales tax 
funds. His agency missed a $7.8-million payment July 12. 
</P>
<P>
He said the delays may cause bond-rating firms to question whether the sales 
tax is as secure a source of revenue as once thought. "What we're concerned 
about is that this could cause a lower rating which translates into higher 
interest," said Sink. "We could be talking hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
higher interest costs."

THIEVES UPROOTING SMALL PALMS FOR LARGE PROFITS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marie Bunnell awoke Monday morning to the sight of a gaping hole in the front 
yard of her Yorba Linda home. Down the street, Andree Noeppe stepped outside to 
discover a similar hole in his front yard. 
</P>
<P>
Someone had made off with their miniature palm trees during the night. 
</P>
<P>
The thefts of the sago palms are just the latest to hit Yorba Linda. In the 
last month, dozens of the small palms have been stolen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and landscapers say the trees are an attractive target because they sell 
for between $500 and $15,000, depending on their height. The small palms grow 
so slowly -- about an inch a year -- that mature trees are considered a prized 
addition to the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"I always warn the people who want to plant them in the front yard that it is 
better to plant them in the back yard where they can keep them under lock and 
key," said Gary Huddleston, manager of the Country Garden Nursery in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
Sago palm thefts also have been reported in Cypress, Fullerton and Garden Grove 
in Orange County over the last year. In Los Angeles County, sheriff's deputies 
report that a number of the small palms were uprooted and stolen in the Santa 
Clarita Valley about two months ago. Sago palms have also disappeared in the 
San Gabriel Valley and around Whittier, nursery owners there say. 
</P>
<P>
Until a month ago, police in Yorba Linda would receive the occasional report of 
a stolen sago, said Lt. Chester Panique of the Brea Police Department, which 
provides police protection for adjoining Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, "we might get seven or eight taken in one night," Panique said. 
Police and local nursery owners estimate that several dozen of the palms have 
been snatched from Yorba Linda residences. 
</P>
<P>
In almost all cases, Panique and other police officials around the region said, 
the palms are taken from residential areas, where homeowners like to show them 
off in their front gardens. Having shallow roots and standing no higher than 
about 5 feet, the trees are easily uprooted and carted away, officials said.

EDDIE QUILLAN; ACTING CAREER SPANNED 60 YEARS

Eddie Quillan, who honed his theatrical skills in silent two-reel Mack Sennett 
comedies and then utilized them in more than 150 films and dozens of television 
shows in a 60-year career, has died in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
He was 83 when he died Thursday of cancer, said his sister, Roseanne Quillan. 
</P>
<P>
Quillan was a longtime resident of North Hollywood who portrayed a series of 
idealistic young heroes and boys next door in some of Hollywood's most notable 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Among them were Ellison, the lovesick mutineer in "Mutiny on the Bounty" 
(1935), a boy accused of murder in "Young Mr. Lincoln" (1939), Connie Rivers, 
the young radio mechanic in "The Grapes of Wrath" (1940) and the candy man in 
"Brigadoon" (1954). 
</P>
<P>
Known for his saucy, light air and a flair for the double-take, Quillan was 
born into a family of vaudevillians in Philadelphia and traveled the country as 
a child, performing in the family's variety act, "A Little Bit of Everything." 
In the mid-1920s, he came to California and landed small parts in Sennett's 
slapstick comedies. 
</P>
<P>
But his big break came when he chanced upon a disabled car on Santa Monica 
Boulevard and stopped to help fix a flat tire, not knowing that the driver was 
an aide to film director Cecil B. DeMille. Quillan was invited to an audition 
and signed a contract with DeMille's Pathe Film Corp. In 1929, he appeared in 
his first feature film, "The Godless Girl." 
</P>
<P>
He generally was consigned to frothy comedies or musical revues but achieved 
occasional breakthroughs in major films. 
</P>
<P>
When he turned to TV late in his career he generally portrayed an assortment of 
cab drivers, bookmakers or thieves on such melodramas as "Police Woman" and 
"Baretta." 
</P>
<P>
But as the mailman in 1968-71 television series "Julia," he was allowed some 
comedic improvisations by producer-director Hal Kanter because of his extensive 
background. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I'd do when I got on the set was to see where the doors are, 
where the props are and figure out what I might do in the way of (funny) 
business," Quillan said in a 1981 Times interview. "There are very few if any 
of us left who know the (impromptu) comedy we learned in that era," he said of 
his Sennett days. 
</P>
<P>
Quillan also was the handyman in the 1964-65 TV series "Valentine's Day" and 
appeared in several episodes of "Little House on the Prairie" and "Highway to 
Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by five sisters, who ask donations in his name to the St. Joseph 
Medical Foundation, 501 S. Buena Vista St., Burbank 91505.

MORE THAN 500 FLOCK TO COUNCIL REMAP SESSION; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: RESULTS OF MARATHON MEETING SCHEDULED TO BE DISCUSSED TODAY.

<P>
More than 500 San Diegans with an interest in the city's redistricting attempt 
gathered in Golden Hall on Monday night to learn if the City Council would vote 
to support one of two competing maps under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 p.m., the council was still gathering testimony from the hundreds of 
people in attendance. It was unclear whether a vote on the controversial maps 
would follow. 
</P>
<P>
However, two motions made at the meeting's outset failed to draw a majority. 
One of them called for a vote after the completion of testimony. The other 
called for a vote at an upcoming council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The results of Monday night's meeting were to be discussed during an 11:30 a.m. 
meeting today in U. S. Magistrate Harry McCue's chambers, and in the early 
afternoon in the chambers of U. S. District Judge John Rhoades. McCue and 
Rhoades are reviewing the city's redistricting effort as part of a settlement 
between the city and the Chicano Federation. 
</P>
<P>
The federation has alleged that the City Council, in its July 9 vote, violated 
the terms of the settlement. At that meeting, a council majority supported a 
map that was introduced by Councilman John Hartley. 
</P>
<P>
A second map, which is supported by the Chicano Federation, was forwarded to 
the council by an appointed redistricting advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Monday night's meeting drew strong comments from supporters 
and detractors of the two maps now being considered by the council. 
</P>
<P>
"We clearly support the Hartley map," said Bonnie Poppy, a Golden Hill resident 
who linked her neighborhood's continued economic revitalization to a 
redistricting that does not split the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Big money can fool most of the people . . . but it can't fool all of us," said 
Eric Seigel, another Golden Hill resident who supports the Hartley map. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory board's map drew strong support from Laura Langman, a San Diegan 
who said the turnout Monday night offered proof that "there are a lot of people 
here who do care." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Beach Town Council President Barbara Hughes complained that the Hart 
ley map "suddenly appeared" with little or no public discussion. Hughes asked 
the council to vote for the advisory board map because Hartley's would split 
her neighborhood in half. 
</P>
<P>
Vicky Durham, who now lives in Councilman Bruce Henderson's district, asked the 
council to support the advisory board's map and then concentrate "on real 
problems that we need to solve." 
</P>
<P>
Irma Castro, executive director of the Chicano Federation, defended the board's 
map-drawing process as open and aboveboard.

UP TO 400 A DAY ARE PACKING THOUSAND OAKS' NEW TEEN CENTER FOR SOME COOL, CLEAN 
FUN 
</P>

Last summer, the mall was the cool place to hang out in Thousand Oaks. Sure, 
some teen-agers liked to meet at the bowling alley for a few sodas. But The 
Oaks Mall was the place to be. 
</P>
<P>
But not this summer -- or at least that's what Maggie Heidenthal, 12, and her 
friends say. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to meet here now," said Heidenthal, lounging on a couch at the 
Thousand Oaks Teen Center on Janss Road at California 23. "We just wasted money 
at the mall." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Wi, 12, added: "Besides, we could get bad habits at the mall, like 
smoking. We can't do that here." 
</P>
<P>
Since the city-sponsored Teen Center opened eight months ago, 300 to 400 
teen-agers frequent it each day -- far surpassing city expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks paid $3 million to build the 13,000-square-foot facility, which 
includes basketball courts, pool tables, video games and a weight room. And 
city officials say the center has been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased," Mayor Alex Fiore said. "We feel that the teens have a 
place they can call their own." 
</P>
<P>
In the evenings, the center usually is packed. Youngsters lounge on bean bags 
and watch movies or MTV. Others play pool or Ping-Pong. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Recreation and Park District, which runs the center for the city, 
sponsors dances twice a month, sometimes attracting 700 teens. A volleyball 
club, indoor soccer, jazzercise and beginning yoga are also available. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is a fee for some of the classes, most of the activities are 
free. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Dodwell, the teen service coordinator, said when he was in high school in 
the early 1980s there was little for teen-agers to do. Now the center fills the 
void. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have a place to have positive interaction," Dodwell said. "It's a 
necessity of life." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Corinne Michel -- visiting friends at the center -- said, 
plainly: "We could be home vegetating and watching soap operas." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the center was first brought up in 1981 by several students and 
park district officials, who formed a committee with city officials to discuss 
their plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a lot of legwork" to get the facility started, said Joe Hinsberg. But 
after dozens of meetings, construction began in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The center is the only one of its kind in Ventura County. Thousand Oaks plans 
to build a similar facility for senior citizens. Until the seniors' facility is 
completed, the city wants to sponsor activities for them at the Teen Center 
when the teen-agers are in school. 
</P>
<P>
Dodwell said there have been a few incidents of vandalism at the center, but 
the problems have been minor. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth (Gypsy) Strauss, 15, said she used to hang out at the bowling alley. 
Now she spends her free time playing pool at the Teen Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I even won the tournament," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Gaines and Kevin Perry, both 12, say they like to play basketball at the 
center. But "sometimes the big guys chase us off the court," Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
Wi said she has one small complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they turn the MTV down too low."

3 KILLED, 1 INJURED WHEN BOATS COLLIDE ON CROWDED RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two power boats, including one carrying five people from Ventura, collided on 
the Kings River near Visalia over the weekend, killing three members of a San 
Fernando Valley family and seriously injuring the driver of the Ventura boat. 
</P>
<P>
The Venturan injured in the fiery collision, Mark Anthony Nichols, 33, had been 
boating with his wife, Lori, and about 20 friends. The group had met regularly 
for boating at the river, which is 3 1/2 hours by car from Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols' boat apparently was cut off by another one on the crowded river, 
Tulare County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
All three people in the second craft were killed outright. Authorities 
identified them as Frederick and Lynn Guillette and their daughter, Nicole, 20 
months, of Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols underwent surgery for a ruptured spleen at Valley Medical Center in 
Fresno. He was in stable condition Monday. Two others from Ventura, identified 
as Brian Wallet and Mike Dietrich, were released after treatment for minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Dave Williams said Monday that the accident was still under 
investigation but that it appeared that Lynn Guillette, 30, who was driving her 
boat, had strayed onto the side of the river used by southbound boaters. Both 
craft in the collision were 12 to 15 feet long with low-profile, fiberglass 
hulls. Neither was towing a skier. 
</P>
<P>
"Every indication is that Nichols was operating in compliance with all 
regulations," Williams said. "It is unknown what the other driver was doing or 
thinking. It looks like they both tried to divert but couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said it was unknown how fast the boats were going. They have top 
speeds of more than 40 m.p.h. Nichols' boat flew over the top of the 
Guillettes', which burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Maltman, whose husband, Craig, was on the Ventura boat, said she was 
riding about 100 yards behind it on an independently powered Jet-Ski when "I 
saw this big explosion, and I saw this boat go up in the air and I thought my 
husband was dead. It was like Vietnam. I was crying before I got there. . . . I 
couldn't believe all our guys survived it. 
</P>
<P>
"The other boat was completely on fire, like a bomb had blown it apart." 
</P>
<P>
A boater who saw the accident put out the fire by using his engine to spray 
water onto it. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Maltman said Dietrich and the fifth passenger, Peter Fliss, tried 
unsuccessfully to revive the injured family. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols' wife, Lori, said in a telephone interview from her husband's hospital 
room that her husband has been boating on the river for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dangerous river, but he knows it very well," said Lori Nichols, who was 
ashore when the accident happened. "Mark did everything he could to avoid it. 
He was as far right as he could go. She was supposed to be to the left. He did 
everything he could. They would have hit the shore if they hadn't hit him." 
</P>
<P>
The collision startled golfers and workers at the Kings River Golf and Country 
Club where the 17th hole runs next to the river. Country club employee Jeff 
Avey told the Associated Press that he was watering a green when he heard the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard one boat gun its engine, like it was turning or taking off real fast," 
Avey said. "Then, within 10 seconds, there was a loud bang and then complete 
silence." 
</P>
<P>
Avey said he ran toward the river with his hose, hoping to help put out the 
flames that poured from one of the boats. "I was yelling, asking if anyone 
needed help," he said. "No one answered." 
</P>
<P>
Frederick Guillette, 31, was a service manager for a Nissan dealership. Lynn 
Guillette was a buyer for J. C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick's father, Frederick Guillette Sr. said Frederick and his brother 
Todd, 27, had both taken their families boating for the week. They were packed 
up and ready to head back to Los Angeles when they decided to use up the 
remaining gasoline, a safety measure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all ready to go home, but the baby had been fussing that she wanted 
a Popsicle," Guillette Sr. said. "So they decided to take a run to use up the 
gas and get Nicole a Popsicle. When they were going, they got broadsided." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Guillette had taken his boat the opposite way on the river, his father 
said. When he came back, he saw his brother's boat burning and sinking and the 
efforts being made by bystanders to rescue the family. 
</P>
<P>
"He came upon the accident and saw all the smoke and recognized his brother's 
boat," Guillette Sr. said. "He and his brother were very close. He has really 
taken it hard." 
</P>
<P>
The couple were married four years ago at the Santa Ynez Mission, near where 
Lynn Guillette grew up in Santa Barbara. They and Nicole are to be buried 
Wednesday in the mission cemetery.

COCAINE CRACKDOWNS CUT SUPPLY, RAISE PRICE; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: A KILOGRAM OF THE DRUG WAS PRICED AT $13,000 IN THE COUNTY LAST 
YEAR, AUTHORITIES SAID. NOW IT SELLS FOR ABOUT $28,000.

<P>
Wholesale cocaine prices in Ventura County have more than doubled and large 
quantities of the drug are much harder to find as a result of law enforcement's 
crackdown on Colombian drug dealers, the county's top narcotics officer said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Paul Anderson of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said that large 
cocaine seizures in the United States last year and the combined efforts of 
federal and local law enforcement agencies in the county also helped account 
for the diminishing supplies locally. 
</P>
<P>
"Wholesale prices have skyrocketed," Anderson said. "We haven't seen these 
types of price increases and unavailability for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Last year a kilogram of cocaine, or about 2.2 pounds of the drug, was priced at 
about $13,000 in Ventura County, he said. Six months ago, it was $20,000. Now, 
he said, a kilo sells in the county for about $28,000. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's observations echo last week's declaration by the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Agency that shortages in wholesale cocaine supplies have been noted 
across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA report to the Senate Judiciary Committee said that the prices dealers 
are paying have surged in recent months and that the purity of the wholesale 
product also has declined. The DEA also attributed the change to law 
enforcement pressure in South America. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the Ventura County shortages, Anderson also noted several large 
seizures of cocaine in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, a Simi Valley police investigation led to the seizure in Los 
Angeles County of 2,068 pounds of cocaine with an estimated street value of $94 
million. And in September, federal authorities seized 20 tons of cocaine, with 
a street value of up to $20 billion, from a warehouse in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the reported shortages that have ensued, officials are still seeing 
multi-kilo deliveries of cocaine into the county, said Bill Modesitt, the agent 
in charge of the DEA office that covers Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis 
Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still seeing people talking about having 100 kilos and we are seizing 
five- and six-kilo amounts," Modesitt said. "Those are substantial amounts for 
Ventura County, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Modesitt said that the increased pressure in Los Angeles against the 
wholesale distributors might have forced them into the Ventura area. About a 
week ago, the DEA seized five kilos of cocaine in Oxnard and arrested three 
Oxnard men and a Los Angeles supplier, Modesitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The men originally promised to deliver 100 kilos but might have been scared off 
from the $2-million deal on July 13 because the DEA informant refused to enter 
the house where they wanted to sell the cocaine, Modesitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested on suspicion of sale and possession of cocaine for sale 
as well as conspiracy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On June 15, the DEA seized six kilos of cocaine and arrested five Los Angeles 
dealers in Thousand Oaks, Modesitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Los Angeles suppliers, believed to be mid-level dealers for a larger 
source, met a DEA informant in an Oxnard parking lot. A second car carrying 
three men followed but did not stop in the parking lot, instead circling the 
area looking for police cars. 
</P>
<P>
When the men in the second car saw some units from the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department, they continued on to U.S. 101 where police pulled them over a short 
time later, Modesitt said. 
</P>
<P>
A search of the car turned up six kilos of cocaine in the trunk. The five men 
were indicted in Federal Court in Los Angeles on charges of possessing cocaine 
with the intent to distribute it, and distribution of cocaine, Modesitt said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Modesitt said more such deliveries might be making their way into 
Ventura County if it were not for the 
</P>
<P>
shortage of wholesale supplies. In addition, he said the purity of the kilos is 
down from about 80% to 40% as suppliers cut it with substitutes to make the 
smaller amounts go further. 
</P>
<P>
"They're sometimes diluting it and making more out of a limited supply," 
Modesitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Wade, the chief toxicologist for the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, 
said that even small amounts of cocaine recently seized have dropped in purity. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell by the tests I'm doing that the cocaine is less potent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers at the next level in the retail chain are handling the wholesale 
shortage in different ways, said Sgt. Gary Pentis of the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Some dealers are hiking prices while others are selling a less pure product, 
the agents said. Several dealers have switched from selling cocaine to dealing 
methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
In the Thousand Oaks area, dealers are charging higher prices for one-sixteenth 
of an ounce. The price for one-sixteenth -- a commonly sold quantity -- has 
risen from about $70 to $90, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard, the Sheriff's Department is seeing dealers charge the same price but 
cut the cocaine more to make it go further, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is still a lot of cocaine on the streets, Pentis said. Dealers 
might be having a harder time getting their supplies to sell to users, but they 
are still getting the supplies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The dealer might have to go to three people instead of one to get a supply," 
Pentis said. "But the coke's still out on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Steve Bowman of the Ventura Police Department agreed, saying that 
detectives have not seen a decrease in the amount of cocaine on Ventura 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the price has been rising. On the street, an eighth of an 
ounce was selling for between $120 and $140. Now, the price has climbed to 
between $180 and $200 for an eighth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman and other detectives said cocaine dealers frustrated by the shortages in 
the county are switching to selling methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
Methamphetamine can be made by anyone "with basic high school chemistry and a 
good recipe," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you already have a customer base, you can supply the methamphetamine 
product and you don't have to rely on South America," Bowman said. "You can cut 
out the middle man: It's the American way." 
</P>
<P>
Methamphetamine gives the user a stimulant effect similar to cocaine, said Lt. 
Anderson of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a methamphetamine high can last between four and 24 hours. 
Cocaine, in contrast, gives the user a euphoric 15 to 45 minutes but wears off 
almost completely in two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"If cocaine's availability has waned, it looks like methamphetamine is gaining 
popularity," Anderson said.

HUMAN SKULL, BONES FOUND ON HILLSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A human skull, some leg, finger and rib bones and about five teeth were found 
on a steep Oak View hillside Monday after rescue crews arrived there to assist 
a driver who had plunged off California 33. 
</P>
<P>
It may take weeks to identify a victim, said Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate, 
although officials believe the bones were from a 30- to 50-year-old woman and 
had been decomposing for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Fire and ambulance crews found the skull 60 feet down the hillside about 6:30 
a.m. Monday while rescuing a driver whose pickup truck plunged off the road on 
the southeast corner of the highway's intersection with Creek Road. The driver 
was making a left turn from Creek Road onto California 33 when he was 
broadsided by another motorist and knocked 70 feet over the side of the road, 
said Norm Plott, spokesman for the Oak View Rescue Squad. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified driver of the pickup was taken to Ojai Community Hospital with 
a possible broken leg and pelvis. About 10 members of the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department's Search and Rescue Squad, four detectives and the coroner 
then spent several hours Monday afternoon searching the hillside for additional 
remains. They found rib and leg bones and the remnants of a leather shoe, said 
Lt. Joe Harwell of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Officials found no obvious signs of trauma or foul play, Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking into all the possible missing persons, but at this point we 
don't have anything definite," Harwell said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

CHOLLAS CLEANUP STILL IN LOW GEAR; 
</P>
<P>
DUMP: LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE THE CITY PROMISED TO CLEAN 
UP THE FORMER LANDFILL SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Almost three years after city officials informed the Navy that Chollas Park 
land promised to the Navy for housing was tainted with lead, officials are 
still confounded about what to do. 
</P>
<P>
City officials told the Navy in October, 1987, that 44 acres of land -- offered 
to the Navy as part of a land swap -- were contaminated by excessive amounts of 
lead from its days as an incinerator site. 
</P>
<P>
Today, city officials are negotiating with state officials over the site, 
trying to wrangle an agreement about how much cleaning up needs to be done and 
which agency should oversee the work. 
</P>
<P>
"We are slowly grinding through the grist mill -- I wish progress was faster, 
but it isn't," said Robert Epler, assistant director of the city's Waste 
Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, however, is not allowing the delay to hold up housing construction. 
Instead of building at Chollas Park, which is about 15 minutes from the 32nd 
Street Naval Station, 310 housing units will be built on a Navy-owned 41-acre 
parcel at Eucalyptus Hills in Lakeside next year, almost an hour northeast of 
the base, said Capt. William Scarborough, executive officer of the Naval 
Engineering Command's Southwest division, which is responsible for the 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The land swap, first announced in August, 1986, after three years of 
negotiations, would give the city a park and a jail near Miramar Naval Air 
Station. In exchange, the Navy would receive the Chollas land for housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Chollas will come through eventually," Scarborough said, "but we aren't 
waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents who live near the land say they are angry about the delays. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that nothing is really getting done; I never hear anything 
getting completed," said Don Day, president of the North Chollas Citizens Assn. 
"The city is interested in getting this land traded to the Navy -- that is the 
impetus for a cleanup. It's not that they want to get this cleaned up for the 
community, and that is real frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents, however, felt the relatively slow pace of the city indicates 
that a thorough job is being done. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel like we have started to go forward," said Karen Jolaine Harris, 
the membership chairman for the Oak Park Community Council and a member of the 
Chollas Lake Park and Recreation Board. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who has lived in the area 35 years and runs a day-care program, said 
she is mostly concerned about protecting the neighborhood children. Inhaling 
and ingesting lead are considered dangerous to children because it has been 
linked to mental retardation. But city officials say the level found at Chollas 
poses no serious risk to neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
To study and assess risks posed by lead found in the soil at Chollas Park, city 
officials have spent more than $340,000 so far. Depending on how the site is 
classified, the cleanup itself could cost another $1 million, Epler said. Or, 
at the worst, it could cost $18 million -- if officials determine that the 
tainted land must be removed rather than encapsulated. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the city will receive the results of a report meant to confirm 
the presence of lead that had been found by earlier tests and to spot-check for 
110 other pollutants. And the site will not be classified until this report is 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are also grappling over which agency will oversee the cleanup of 
Chollas -- a task usually handled by the state. Since the state does not 
consider the site one of its more dangerous ones, officials say they cannot get 
involved with overseeing a cleanup until the mid-1990s, and the city doesn't 
want to wait that long, Epler said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, county health officials are now negotiating with the state to oversee 
the cleanup, said Gary R. Stephany, director of environmental health for the 
county's Department of Health Services. And officials for the county and 
state's Department of Health Services are now hammering out a memo of 
understanding between the two agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Hartley, whose district contains the site, said he was pleased 
that officials in charge of the cleanup have become more responsive to the 
concerns of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"We had problems initially because the city was proceeding without input from 
the public," said Hartley, who added that officials now regularly hold meetings 
to inform the public of progress in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Burning garbage used to be a fairly typical means of disposal. Officials, 
however, have since discovered that canned goods, which once had lead seams, 
leached the lead into the soil. The nation is covered with thousands of ash 
dump sites like Chollas. And officials are just beginning to grapple with the 
cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a complex process that has not been gone through before, and there 
is no easy way of doing it," Epler said.

LAGOMARSINO'S FOE WANTS SPENDING CAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Candidate Anita Perez Ferguson has challenged incumbent Rep. Robert J. 
Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) to limit campaign spending in the November election to 
$400,000 for each candidate in the 19th Congressional District race. 
</P>
<P>
But a top aide to Lagomarsino, who in 1988 helped wage the most expensive 
congressional race in the country, dismissed the challenge as an act of 
demagoguery that cannot be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson issued the challenge in a July 17 letter to Lagomarsino. "I would like 
this to be viewed as a model campaign and not viewed, once again, as the most 
expensive campaign in the country," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lagomarsino camp was not impressed. "I find it surprising and 
amateurish that she would release this statement to the press prior to hearing 
from us, therefore it is not hard to conclude that it is demagoguery," 
Lagomarsino campaign manager Reb Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
"Given those circumstances, it's hard to take it seriously," Wayne said. But he 
said Lagomarsino would issue a formal response later this week. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Lagomarsino and state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) spent about 
$1.5 million each in the race that Lagomarsino won by less than 1%. Ferguson, 
an educational consultant, is a former aide to Hart. 
</P>
<P>
This year, campaign spending has dropped considerably, mostly because Ferguson 
is having a tough time raising large cash contributions. So far, she has raised 
about $6,000 in donations and spent $12,000, a campaign aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lagomarsino has raised about $150,000. He has also outspent his 
opponent 2 to 1 while leaving most of his cash reserves untouched. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Lagomarsino has always done what he thinks is necessary to win the 
election and no more," Wayne said. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

CSUN CAMPUS NEAR CAPACITY FOR FALL

The Ventura branch of Cal State Northridge is virtually full for the fall 
semester and has stopped accepting undergraduate applications for all but one 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have more students than we have classes for," campus director 
Joyce Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I find it kind of alarming. It focuses on the enormous need in 
Ventura County for additional opportunities for higher education." 
</P>
<P>
Applications are usually accepted at least until Aug. 1. Increased demand has 
forced officials to move the deadline up in recent years, officials said. 
However, applications for the undergraduate health education program will be 
accepted until Aug. 1, as well as applications for some graduate programs. 
</P>
<P>
Last semester, the campus had space for the equivalent of about 370 full-time 
students. That will increase to about 450 for the 1990-91 school year, Kennedy 
said. About 1,100 mostly part-time students are enrolled at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
That projected growth will not be sufficient to accommodate the students 
seeking to enroll, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Estimating that the deadline for the spring, 1991, semester could be as early 
as September, school officials urged students to apply as soon as possible.

PETITION SEEKS TO CANCEL SELECTION OF SCHOOL TRUSTEE; 
</P>
<P>
BROWN ACT: A GROUP HOPES TO FORCE THE ANTELOPE VALLEY SCHOOL BOARD TO FILL A 
TRUSTEE VACANCY BY ELECTION. THEY SAY THE APPOINTMENT OF A FORMER BOARD MEMBER 
VIOLATED THE STATE OPEN MEETINGS LAW. 
</P>

<P>
Alleging favoritism and improper secrecy, critics began a petition drive Monday 
aimed at overturning a controversial appointment and forcing a special election 
to fill a seat on Antelope Valley's high school board. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said they have nothing against Bob McMullen, a former school board 
member who was picked by the school board last Wednesday to fill the vacancy. 
But they objected to what they called school officials' secretive method of 
picking McMullen, and argued that the choice properly belongs to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The petition papers were taken out Monday by a group headed by former Antelope 
Valley Union High School District board President Bill Olenick. Olenick 
acknowledged he would be a candidate in the election if the petition drive 
succeeds in gathering about 1,400 signatures of district voters by the Aug. 17 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the appointment was handled, it was very clear to anyone that this 
smacked of a good-old-boy deal, and it was a clear violation of the Brown Act," 
the state's open meetings law, said Olenick, who lost his seat in last 
November's election. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, a successful petition, once verified, would immediately cancel 
the school board's appointment of McMullen and force the district to hold an 
election for the job within four months. The seat became vacant when former 
school board President Larry Rucker died of cancer June 13. 
</P>
<P>
Olenick said he and others upset with the board's decision want to gather about 
3,000 signatures within 10 days and hope to gain a spot on the regular Nov. 6 
ballot. Adding the school board seat to that ballot could cost the district 
about $85,000, the county has estimated. 
</P>
<P>
But county education officials said Monday that time is running short for the 
November ballot. And they said a successful petition now more likely would 
result in the district having to sponsor its own separate election at a later 
date at a cost that could be twice as high as the $85,000 figure. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen's appointment angered some Antelope Valley residents both because the 
school board originally could have chosen to fill the vacant seat through an 
election, but didn't, and because the monthlong process that led to the 
selection was conducted in virtual secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
The school board waived its own bylaws that required an open candidate search 
prior to any appointment. And although district officials now acknowledge 
McMullen was their likely choice from the start, they refused to even disclose 
his name until the night he showed up to be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
The board also might have violated the Brown Act open meetings law by meeting 
last month to discuss McMullen's appointment, even though the issue was not on 
its agenda, and by having a series of private communications on the subject 
between Supt. Kenneth Brummel and individual board members, critics said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have insisted they did not violate the state's open meetings 
law. And they said they picked McMullen to save the district the $85,000 cost 
of an election, and because he was a 12-year veteran of the board until he 
stepped down last November to move to Cambria. He says he intends to move back 
to the district. 
</P>
<P>
Olenick, a Quartz Hill resident, served four years and became board president 
before being defeated last November. That came after his much-publicized arrest 
for allegedly hitting his wife in a domestic dispute. No charges were filed and 
she later recanted the story. They are now divorced.

STUDY SAYS POLICE FACE MANPOWER CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego employs 1.6 officers for every thousand residents, but the city 
police union analyzed the number of police actually working on the street and 
found the ratio far lower. 
</P>
<P>
In a station-to-station study by the Police Officers' Assn., the labor 
organization concluded that many areas of San Diego are protected by an 
on-the-street police manpower level of one officer per 15,000 to 19,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city now funds 1.6 officers per 1,000 residents, national averages 
call for a minimum of 2 or more officers for every 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has a total of 1,821 sworn officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Manpower has reached a state where officers' safety is critical and at an 
all-time low," said Willie P. Smith, a patrol sergeant in the department's 
Northern Division and the study's author. 
</P>
<P>
"To say we presently have 1.6 officers per thousand is misleading and does not 
represent the number of officers needed or available to handle police problems. 
It is similar to a racehorse owner saying he has 20 jockeys but only one of 
them can ride a horse." 
</P>
<P>
Steve McMillan, a POA vice president, said Monday that many of the city's sworn 
officers work desk jobs and other non-emergency assignments, while others are 
on vacation or injury and sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the beat cops who are suffering," he said. "It's the guy in the uniform." 
</P>
<P>
The official number of sworn Police Department members, which includes 
supervisors, desk assignments, injured and light-duty personnel, has been set 
at 1.6 officers per thousand residents for several years. Recently, however, 
city and police administrators have been trying to increase the number of 
uniformed officers on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Larry Gore, a police spokesman, said police administrators are aware that 
on-the-street staffing levels are lower than the 1.6 ratio. "I'm not at all 
surprised," he said of the POA study. 
</P>
<P>
The city fiscal year budget that recently ended had allocated $139.9 million to 
the Police Department. In May, City Manager John Lockwood proposed a 
$145-million police budget for fiscal year 1990-91, and the City Council 
eventually gave tentative approval to $153 million. That number is expected to 
be given final approval today. The extra $8 million was earmarked to restore 
the police community safety officer program, the boat patrol program and the 
horse patrol unit, all of which would have been lost with Lockwood's lower 
funding recommendation. But, had the City Council scuttled the horse and boat 
programs, they would have freed up more than a dozen officers to work regular 
beat patrol, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, city officials also are considering a ballot initiative for November 
that they hope will bring in new money for street cops.

MOORPARK COUNCIL BACKS OFF FROM GROWTH MEASURE; LAWSUIT FEARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Threatened with a lawsuit from builders, the Moorpark City Council on Monday 
decided against placing on the Nov. 6 ballot a controversial measure that would 
have forced elections on many growth issues. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed measure was blocked by its own co-author, Councilman Scott 
Montgomery. He withdrew his support at Monday night's council meeting after 
members of the building industry threatened to sue the city. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery said he was unwilling to expose the city to a legal challenge after 
City Attorney Cheryl Kane told the council that a lawsuit could cost as much as 
$250,000 to fight in court. 
</P>
<P>
"Moving ahead with the ordinance will guarantee the council will be sued," 
Montgomery told his fellow council members, who decided to send the measure 
back to a committee. By not voting Monday, the council failed to meet the 
deadline for placing the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law, called "a comprehensive planning ordinance," would haved 
triggered an election each time new development involved zoning changes that 
would push traffic volume over specific limits. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, voters would have to approve any change at a 25-unit apartment 
house, say from medium- to high-density to allow more units, that would push 
the number of car trips generated by the building above 203 per day. 
</P>
<P>
Such changes now require only approval by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal grew out of complaints about traffic in Moorpark, a city of nearly 
27,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tryon, executive director of the Building Industry Assn., which represents 
350 builders and developers in Ventura County, questioned the measure's 
legality. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has reasonable merit for a legal challenge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Holmes, legislative advocate for the Building Industry Assn., said the 
proposed measure would violate state law that grants cities power to set 
land-use policies -- powers they cannot pass on to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
In a July 11 letter to the City Council, the builders group attacked the 
proposed ordinance, saying, "Voters will be forced to make important decisions 
based on 60-second sound bites." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to ask the public to make these critical decisions," Tryon said in 
an interview. "What does it turn into? Maybe a guy gets his project approved 
because he's good at politics." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Clint Harper, co-author of the measure with Montgomery, called the 
builders association's attacks a smoke screen intended to keep voters from 
having a say in critical decisions which affect them. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said Moorpark voters are well-informed about growth issues, especially 
the ones affecting their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said he was dismayed by Montgomery's change of heart, but said he 
intends to draft an identical ballot initiative and seek enough signatures to 
place it on a future ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason that the ordinance is being attacked by the building industry is 
that if were implemented it would be effective," Harper said. "They see this 
ordinance as a threat." 
</P>
<P>
He said the building industry, "is not concerned the public won't understand. 
They're concerned the public will understand it and will agree with the 
concept." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, when voters passed a growth-control ordinance called Measure 
F, the association sued to block it. The suit was settled when Moorpark agreed 
to increase the annual limit on building permits from 250 to 270. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the city won," Harper said. "Measure F is still in place." 
</P>
<P>
But the measure also raised objections among members of the City Council, 
including Councilman Paul Lawrason and Councilwoman Eloise Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a pile of litigation on our hands now that we can't seem to get out 
from under," Lawrason said.

FOREST SERVICE MAY BILL MARINES FOR BRUSH FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U. S. Forest Service will consider billing the Marine Corps for the 
$2-million cost of fighting a brush fire last year that was caused by a Camp 
Pendleton platoon. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service Special Agent Tom LaNier said Monday that the service's legal 
office in San Francisco will review the Marine Corps' investigative report and 
determine whether to hold the corps financially liable for the 10,000-acre 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
He said the review will also enable the agency to decide whether two Marines 
involved in the incident should face penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm requesting a copy of the (investigative) report to see if there was gross 
negligence or what did go on," LaNier said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, finished in November but released last week, concluded that 
the Oct. 18 fire, which took about 900 firefighters five days to contain, was 
caused by the "unlawful use of pyrotechnics." 
</P>
<P>
The report says that 1st Lt. Joseph Shannon took a 10-man platoon and a 
canister of flares and smoke grenades into the firing range for a training 
exercise and allowed the devices to be discharged in an area that was 
restricted because of high fire danger. 
</P>
<P>
The incendiary devices started two quick-spreading fires that eventually burned 
parts of San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The report says Shannon received a military violation notice for improperly 
firing the pyrotechnics, failing to maintain communication with the firing 
range control officer and not reporting that a Marine suffered smoke 
inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
Another Marine, Staff Sgt. John Cadigan, who gave Shannon the devices and asked 
him to dispose of them, received a warning, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
LaNier said the Forest Service was unaware until last week that the Marine 
Corps had investigated the fire, although Camp Pendleton officials acknowledged 
from the beginning that Marines had started it. 
</P>
<P>
"They were up-front; it was military maneuvers," LaNier said. However, the 
report raises questions about whether the fire was caused during normal 
activities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a chance they were outside the scope of normal maneuvers. . . . we 
will try to go after the military or potentially the individuals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects the Forest Service's legal office to complete its review in 
30 to 60 days.

MOLESTATION SUSPECT SLAIN IN MEXICAN JAIL

<P>
A Ventura man jailed on child sexual assault charges was found stabbed to death 
in his cell at La Loma prison in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal judicial police say William Lee Heigel's body was discovered early 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Villegas, group leader for the State Judicial Police, said a preliminary 
inquest indicated that Heigel died of multiple stab wounds to the neck, 
shoulders, back and chest. 
</P>
<P>
Villegas said Heigel was attacked with a machete by a man sharing the cell. The 
suspect was identified as Cresencio Hernandez Tovar, 35. 
</P>
<P>
Heigel, 43, was a convicted sex offender who was first arrested for molesting 
boys in 1965. Officials said he had an IQ of 60. He spent much of his life in 
California mental institutions and later in prisons for sex crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Trejo Constantino, head of Nuevo Laredo Ministerio Publico, said Tovar 
told investigators that he had been sleeping when Heigel started kicking him 
and a fight ensued. Officials don't know how Tovar got the knife, Trejo 
Constantino said. 
</P>
<P>
Tovar is serving a 22-year sentence for several offenses, including aggravated 
sexual assault and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Heigel came to the attention of Mexican authorities several months ago in 
connection with a series of sexual assaults on young boys in different cities. 
He was arrested April 30 in Nuevo Laredo as he stepped off a bus from Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
He was detained by police after they discovered pornographic photos of boys in 
his luggage. A federal judge in Nuevo Laredo ordered Heigel held for medical 
observation at La Loma. 
</P>
<P>
Trejo Constantino said Heigel admitted to having molested as many as 50 boys 
under the age of 12 over three years. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB TO BE UPGRADED

<P>
The Hueneme school board has hired an Agoura electronics firm to upgrade the 
computerized teaching laboratory at Larsen School, making it the most 
sophisticated of the learning labs in its nine elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
At its Monday night meeting, the board awarded Sota Electronics a $295,519 
contract to improve the elementary school's computerized learning center, known 
as the World Institute for Computer Assisted Teaching lab. 
</P>
<P>
Don Cody, administrative assistant for the school district, said the 
improvements should be completed this fall. The cost of the computer upgrade 
will be picked up by funds from the state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Computer equipment at the 719-student Larsen School is the oldest of the 
district's elementary schools, Cody said. The computer lab is slated for 
upgrade to a first-generation Smart Classroom, a watered-down version of the 
technology-based education labs operating at the district's two junior high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously our staff is excited," Principal Cruz Earls said. "We don't want to 
be just a computer lab. We want to go beyond to where we facilitate the 
children's imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Cody said the district is scheduled to enter into an agreement immediately so 
Sota can get to work updating the 8-year-old computer equipment. The new lab 
will feature color monitors, faster software programs and a management system 
able to handle more students at one time while keeping track of their scores 
and lessons. SCOTT LAWRENCE

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two women who beat a 20-year-old San Fernando woman to death with a baseball 
bat were sentenced Monday to four years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Rodriguez, 21, of San Fernando and Socorro Mauricio, 21, of Pacoima 
pleaded guilty in March to voluntary manslaughter in connection with the death 
of Elizabeth Valdivia. 
</P>
<P>
Valdivia was beaten to death as she walked home from work on the night of June 
13, 1989. Rodriguez and Mauricio were arrested a short time later. 
Investigators said the three women had been friends, and that Rodriguez and 
Mauricio were upset by a breakup in the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Valdivia's family members urged San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. Major 
to impose a tough sentence on Rodriguez and Mauricio. "They have to pay for 
what they did," said Victor Valdivia, brother of the deceased woman.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN WHO FAKED DEATH ADMITS MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newhall man who faked his own death to throw police off his trail pleaded no 
contest Monday to two counts of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Edward Stephens, once a member of Big Brothers of Greater Los Angeles, 
admitted that he molested a boy, now 17, in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens, 35, entered his plea before San Fernando Superior Court Judge Howard 
J. Schwab and remains in custody. He is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens was arrested in January by FBI agents in St. Petersburg, Fla., after 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department received an anonymous tip from a 
television viewer who saw a profile of Stephens on "L.A.'s Most Dangerous" 
program last September. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens had been charged with child molestation two years ago but fled 
California while free on bail, authorities said. In an attempt to persuade 
sheriff's investigators that he had died, Stephens ran death notices in the 
Newhall Signal in 1988 and sent suicide notes to relatives, authorities said. 
Authorities said they never believed the ruse and had continued looking for 
him.

A man who authorities said romanced, then stole from women across the country 
was sentenced to more than seven years in state prison Monday after pleading no 
contest to crimes committed over the past two years in the Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys. 
</P>

David Frederick Kohl, 42, pleaded no contest to commercial burglary, grand 
theft auto and grand theft in San Fernando Superior Court. Judge Ronald S. Coen 
sentenced Kohl, who was about to face trial on 11 felony counts, to seven years 
and four months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, Kohl was a professional con man who romanced women, 
then took their money, jewelry and other possessions. 
</P>
<P>
However, only one of the charges to which Kohl pleaded no contest Monday 
involved a woman he wooed. In a plea bargain, several other charges involving 
his relationship with women were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Kohl took several thousand dollars worth of jewelry 
in March from a Santa Clarita Valley woman he befriended. Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Sgt. Greg Palmieri said Kohl lived with the woman for about a year 
before stealing the jewelry. Palmieri said most of the jewelry was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Mitch Bruckner said Kohl pleaded guilty to avoid serving 
more time in prison. Had the case gone to trial, Kohl could have faced 10 to 15 
years in state prison on charges that included writing bad checks, embezzlement 
and stealing blank checks. 
</P>
<P>
Palmieri said Kohl has a long history of wooing lonely women, then stealing 
money from their bank accounts or racking up huge credit card bills in their 
names. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl also pleaded no contest to charges that he stole furniture from a storage 
building belonging to his former employer, Griffin Homes. He also did not fight 
a charge that he stopped making payments on a car he purchased from a used car 
dealership.

</P>
<P>
A native of Italy, Rivetti came to the United States when he was 4 years old. 
He moved to Van Nuys in 1943 and began playing the piano and accordion in 
films. He appeared in "Cloak and Dagger" (1946), "The Greatest Show on Earth" 
(1952) and "Jailhouse Rock" (1957), among others. From the mid-1940s until his 
retirement in the late 1960s, Rivetti taught music at his home. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 50 years; daughters, Gilda Boswell of Newport 
Beach, Esther Garvin of Van Nuys, Rita Stalker of Sacramento and Norma Rivetti 
of Porterville; brothers, Louie Rivetti of Greenville, Ohio, and Tony Rivetti 
of Baltimore; sisters, Carmella Ross of Aliquippa, Pa. and Anna Rivetti of 
North Miami, Fla.; and two grandsons. 
</P>

WIDOW IS REUNITED WITH FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 82-year-old widow from Tecate, Mexico, and her daughter received a check for 
$16,438.40 from the state controller's office Monday -- money they didn't know 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
The money, which included $6,923.09 in interest, was returned to Rosa Chacon de 
Ramirez, who spends summers in the home she owns in Chula Vista, and her 
daughter, Rosa de Zorrilla, as part of the state's "Claim What's Yours" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to reunite Californians with more than $650 million in 
unclaimed property, said Jay Ziegler, spokesman for State Controller Gray 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the money stockpiles in banks because people are beneficiaries in wills 
they don't know about, or they forget about previously opened bank accounts, 
safe deposit boxes and stock certificates. 
</P>
<P>
"The odds are one in 10 that people have some money out there," Ziegler said. 
</P>
<P>
De Ramirez and her daughter didn't know about the money because it had been put 
into a trust fund in the 1960s by De Ramirez's father-in-law after her 
husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
The women found out about the money after an "heir finder" contacted De 
Ramirez's son, Joaquim Ramirez, of Chula Vista, who then called the 
controller's office, Ziegler said. Independent heir finders track down people 
to unite them with their money for a finder's fee. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the state has returned $81 million to 171,000 Californians. 
</P>
<P>
After an account has been dormant for more than five years, banks are required 
to turn the money over to the state, where it accrues 5% interest annually 
until someone claims it. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who thinks they might have unclaimed property should call the state 
controller's office at 800-992-4647.

CITY OKS EARLY STAGE OF LONG-RANGE DOWNTOWN PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Monday adopted a preliminary, long-range plan 
that proponents say will produce a vibrant urban center by limiting 
construction of downtown office buildings, protecting bayfront views and 
stimulating the growth of several downtown residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is the result of more than two years of work by the Centre City 
Planning Committee, chaired by developer Ernest W. Hahn. The plan includes 
several major land-use policy changes that "will dramatically influence the 
future of downtown San Diego," according to a lengthy staff report by the city 
planning department. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary plan approved Monday is "the largest planning step ever taken 
by a major U.S. city" in an attempt to direct downtown growth and control 
vehicle traffic, Hahn said after the meeting. "It's a major step." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn did, however, advise council members that parts of the plan might need to 
be reworked. "It's impossible to think that we have a plan that's perfect," 
Hahn said. "None of them ever are." 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary plan, which will be followed in a year by a final plan, calls 
for: 
</P>
<P>
* A strip of land along the harbor front, from Lindbergh Field to Barrio Logan, 
for recreational, visitor and marine district uses. 
</P>
<P>
* Mixed-use pockets, with a focus on residential neighborhoods, that would ring 
the existing core of tall, downtown office buildings. The pockets would be 
built on tracts that were zoned largely for commercial and office projects. 
</P>
<P>
* A transportation plan that would expand light-rail and bus systems as well as 
incorporate a "parking management program" designed to keep traffic flowing as 
the city grows. 
</P>
<P>
* A "Broadway Spine" that would cluster the city's largest and most intense 
land uses along a stretch of Broadway between Harbor Drive and an eastern point 
that might incorporate a proposed city office complex. The plan is designed to 
bolster Broadway's role as the "ceremonial street," linking one end of downtown 
with the other. 
</P>
<P>
The plan centers on "San Diego's unique opportunity to have its downtown 
focused on a large section of the San Diego Bay," according to the planning 
report. The preliminary plan is also designed to protect existing "view 
corridors" that give downtown office workers and downtown residents views of 
Point Loma to the west and Mexico to the south. 
</P>
<P>
The general plan drew support from a wide range of downtown civic and business 
groups. However, those groups -- and some council members, said Monday that 
specific parts of the overall plan might need to be reworked.

MISL WITHSTANDS ONE MORE STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The MISL, the little league that could, ascended another mountain of problems 
Monday without breaking down. And when it did, Commissioner Earl Foreman said 
he knew all along it could. 
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive year, the Major Indoor Soccer League fought off 
collapse when St. Louis Storm owner Milan Mandaric announced he had decided not 
to fold his team. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Mandaric, who lives in San Jose, will go forward with new St. Louis 
investors who committed over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the MISL will head into the season, its 13th, with its 
franchises intact from the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
The league has eight members: the Sockers, the Storm, Baltimore, Cleveland, 
Dallas, Kansas City, Tacoma and Wichita. But had the Storm folded, the Sockers, 
according to owner Ron Fowler, would have followed suit. There were reports 
other owners also demanded an eight-team league if they were to maintain 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman, however, denied any team was on the brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"You know Milan never left the league," he said. "He had some misgivings, some 
doubt about his support in St. Louis, but Milan and I have been talking about 
those problems and working them out since the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
But Fowler told a different story. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have given you a snowball's chance (that the league would survive) 
on Friday," he said. "For about the fifth time Milan said he wasn't going to 
play. . . . But some crystallization of the situation occurred over the 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Mandaric not only got the investors he sought over the weekend, but also 
received some concessions from the city of St. Louis and Mayor Vince Schoemehl, 
Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandaric was en route to St. Louis and could not be reached for comment. 
Schoemehl was not returning phone calls, but both were scheduled to appear at a 
press conference this morning. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman in Schoemehl's office, however, said there had been talks between 
Schoemehl and Mandaric about revenues from parking and from selling advertising 
space along the dasher boards at The Arena. The city currently collects all 
such revenues from the Storm and the NHL Blues. The money goes toward the debt 
incurred by the city when it bought The Arena four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
There were other encouraging developments that swayed Mandaric to keep the 
team, which lost a reported $1.5 million last year. Among them is a pending 
agreement with the United States Soccer Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said there are now "four or five different things going on" between the 
two groups. 
</P>
<P>
USSF spokesman John Polis said Foreman and Werner Fricker, president of the 
USSF, were having discussions about player availability. 
</P>
<P>
"Both men have indicated to me that they will be discussing the issue with the 
goal of ensuring that (MISL) players will be available to the U.S. National 
team," Polis said. 
</P>
<P>
It also was learned that Bob Gansler, coach of the U.S. National team, which is 
under the direction of the USSF, is in Baltimore for this week's league 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he has all eight teams stabilized heading into the meetings, Foreman 
felt comfortable the league he founded in 1978 has turned the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted that we can now look to all the positive things that are 
happening," Foreman said. "This is a great time to be involved in soccer and 
the MISL." 
</P>
<P>
Positive things in the MISL? Well, Foreman says there are at least three teams 
(Kansas City, Dallas and Baltimore) that look to turn a profit in the coming 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Is Foreman expecting a financial windfall? No, he is counting on lower 
operating expenses. A new collective bargaining agreement between management 
and the players union, to be voted on this week by the owners, would bring the 
salary cap down to $630,000 from $770,000 per team. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman's optimism also is fueled by the league's new ownership, which has 
improved in the areas of money management and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an esprit de corps taking place here," Foreman said. "And that's what 
I've been pushing for for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Added Fowler, "The owners now put the league first and their teams second." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas owner Phil Cobb said he expects the Sidekicks to be in the black next 
season, although the team lost $800,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
He's not the only one with such hopes. Kansas City and Baltimore "are also 
bullish," Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman said the MISL can tell potential expansion-team owners that it is 
possible to make money in indoor soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now going in telling them, 'OK, if you know what you're doing, if you 
organize and operate properly with a good business plan, here's what you could 
do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fowler and Foreman said the league will expand by at least two cities before 
the 1991-92 season, and Fowler said there are at least four strong candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler would not say what cities have expressed interest, but Cobb recently 
listed Albany, N.Y.; Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Cincinnati; Minneapolis; 
Portland, Ore.; Sacramento and Tampa Bay as potential expansion sites.

PADRES PLAYING BROKEN RECORD: RIDDOCH'S (1-11) 
</P>

<P>
The office was bare. Gone are the portraits of Jack McKeon. Gone are the 
memorabilia that McKeon accumulated over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't even a scent of cigar smoke. 
</P>
<P>
No matter, even with everything cleaned out of the Padre manager's office, the 
same woes continue for whoever dares to sit in the chair. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Riddoch, watching his team lose its eighth consecutive game, 9-2 Monday 
night to the Cincinnati Reds, is finding out firsthand what drove McKeon out of 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres landed Riddoch in the team record book with their longest losing 
streak since 1980. Riddoch's 1-11 record is the worst of any starting Padre 
manager in history. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Riddoch says, "'I'm not sleeping real good, and I'm not eating. Heck, 
now I'm even starting to lose my hair." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres -- who were booed loudly several times during the game by the crowd 
of 18,238 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium -- put on their usual performance. 
They lost for the 24th time in the past 27 games. They failed to score more 
than three runs for the 19th time in the past 24 games, and the 50th time of 
the season. And, oh yeah, the second they committed three more errors and are 
proud owners of the second-worst defense in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Just how bleak has the Padres' situation, 38-54, 21 games out of first place, 
become? 
</P>
<P>
Well, look at this way: If the Reds continue at this current pace, the Padres 
will have to go 66-4 the remainder of the season just to tie for first. 
</P>
<P>
Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch tried to forget all his problems while he was putting put up two 
snapshot pictures of his youngest son. He placed his hitting tendency charts in 
the desk. And that was about the extent of his decorating. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned in this business, you can't put too many pictures on the wall," 
Riddoch said, "because you might soon be taking them down." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch then went about opening his mail, trying to put at least a dent in the 
bulk on his desk, which consisted of three stacks of letters, 10 telegrams and 
five telexes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hearing from people I haven't heard for years," Riddoch said, "and most of 
them are wondering the same thing I am. What's going on? People are used to me 
turning things around, working so hard that things will come together. 
</P>
<P>
"I reached a point where I feel I can make an impact on people's lives, but I 
haven't done that. It's difficult for anyone to say he can make an impact, and 
I still feel I can." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the kicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also intelligent enough to know that there's a lot of things I can't 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Padres have now reached the conclusion that it might be impossible for 
even Connie Mack to turn this team around. And considering they've already 
changed mangers once this season, you can be assured that it'll be the players 
who next will go. 
</P>
<P>
Say hello to Trader Jack, whose fingers are starting to get callouses from 
dialing the phone these past two weeks to general managers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally embarrassed right now," said McKeon, vice president/baseball 
operations. "I can't understand it. I left the manager's job, and I'm still 
beating my head against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Something's going to have to be done." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon is talking with three or four clubs about possible trades before the 
July 31 waiver period expires. He talked with the Boston Red Sox and Kansas 
City Royals during the All-Star break, and spoke again with Red Sox General 
Manager Lou Gorman late last week. In fact, Eddie Kasko, scouting director of 
the Boston Red Sox, spent four games in St. Louis scouting the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said no specific trade proposals have been discussed with the Red Sox, 
but sources close to the Red Sox say that Gorman is interest in acquiring 
either left-handed starter Bruce Hurst or Dennis Rasmussen. The Padres, sources 
say, have expressed interest in left fielder Mike Greenwell, center fielder 
Ellis Burks and triple-A third baseman Scott Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Padres would prefer obtaining Burks in a trade involving Hurst, 
sources say that the Red Sox are unwilling to trade him. Instead, they are 
offering Greenwell. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, however, are a bit skeptical of acquiring Greenwell for the simple 
reason that they have plenty of left fielders who are marginal defensively on 
their roster. Greenwell also is plagued by tendinitis in his left ankle, which 
requires him to wear an air cast, and is scaring off several teams. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a pitcher with rotator-cuff tendinitis, trying to throw the ball," 
said Red Sox physician Arthur Pappas, describing Greenwell, who has only four 
homers this season. "You just don't develop the same power thrust." 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea whether anything will happen," McKeon said. "I do know what 
they want is pitching." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres still are interested in acquiring reliever Mark Davis and either 
outfielder Bo Jackson or outfielder Danny Tartabull from the Royals, but 
Jackson and Tartabull are on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm talking to some clubs," McKeon said, "but I don't see things breaking 
loose. My phone's not exactly ringing off the hook with teams wanting these 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. You look at the names, and it's not a bad ballclub. But that's 
individually, not collectively. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't bet your ass we'll be hearing about how good they were (from their 
agents) this winter, though." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are scheduled to address their plan of attack in a meeting this 
morning between Padre chairman Tom Werner, McKeon and Riddoch. One of the 
primary topics will be whether to retool for 1991 or to continue plugging 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to go for the championship," McKeon said. "Look at the 
Reds, they bounced back. We need to plug a gap here, and a gap there. I just 
can't see how these guys can keep staying down." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also could address the potential free-agent market, and sources in 
the organization said that St. Louis Cardinal center fielder Willie McGee will 
be atop their list. 
</P>
<P>
McGee, 32, who was National League Player of the Week with his .448 batting 
average, said he would be highly interested in playing for the Padres on one 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason I'd want to come is because of (first baseman) Jack Clark," he 
said. "He's a great player, and a great guy to have around. I played with him 
once, and wherever he plays next year, that's where I want to play. 
</P>
<P>
"He can make a big difference on any club." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon grunted when he heard McGee's comments. 
</P>
<P>
The way things are going, it's not a question of who goes, but just who stays. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
National League President Bill White is expected to rule today on Padre first 
baseman Jack Clark's ejection Sunday in St. Louis. Clark threw his bat and 
helmet on the field. Then, after he reached the dugout, he threw two more 
helmets and made an obscene gesture. National League officials said Monday that 
Clark definitely will be fined; it's unknown whether White will suspend Clark 
for between one and three days. . . . Padre starter Andy Benes will miss his 
second successive start Wednesday because of a stiff left shoulder he sustained 
July 12 in a melee with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He will be replaced by either 
Calvin Schiraldi or John Davis will make the start. . . . Padre catcher Benito 
Santiago, who sustained a broken left arm June 14, is expected to get his cast 
off in another 10 days to two weeks, when his arm will be X-rayed again. The 
Padres don't expect to be back before Sept. 1. "We're not going to rush him," 
Manager Greg Riddoch said. "I don't want to say he's going to lead us to the 
promised land, because he's not." 
</P>
<P>
You want to know why the Padres aren't scoring? Take a look at the Padres' top 
of the order with two out and runners in scoring position: Bip Roberts: .233, 
no homers, eight RBIs; Roberto Alomar: .286, no homers, 11 RBIs; Tony Gwynn: 
.229, no homers, eight RBIs; Jack Clark: .167, one homer, eight RBIs; Joe 
Carter: .137, two homers, 12 RBIs. Shortstop Garry Templeton is the only 
starter with success in that situation, batting .344 with two homers and 14 
RBIs. . . . The Padres and Chicago White Sox are working on a trade, but it's 
expected to involve an exchange of minor-league players. . . . The Padres had 
their first Kangaroo Court meeting since it was installed at the All-Star 
break. The judges were outfielder Fred Lynn, pitcher Ed Whitson and catcher 
Mark Parent. Whitson and pitcher Eric Show were fined the most, $35 apiece. The 
judges did not disclose the total amount of the fines, but let's just say the 
San Diego Children's Hospital, the recipient of the money at the end of the 
year, is quite appreciative. 
</P>
<P>
Reds owner Marge Schott spent the game visiting with former Padre owner Joan 
Kroc. The two plan to spend today at the San Diego Zoo, and then will watch 
tonight's game on Cable TV. . . . Joe Carter, who leads the team with 64 RBIs, 
has had 233 men on base when he has batted this season. . . . The Padres will 
play the second game of their four-game series at 7:35 tonight to accommodate 
ESPN-TV. Bruce Hurst (5-8) and Jack Armstrong (11-5) are the scheduled 
starters. . . . There were 21 players in attendance Monday from the Padres' 
Class A team, which had the night off. . . . Injuries continue to plague the 
Padres' minor-league teams. The latest occurred Saturday night when center 
fielder Craig Pueschner of Class A Charleston sustained a broken leg and 
dislocated ankle while sliding into second. Manager Jack Krol told Tom 
Romenesko, director of player development, that "it was as nasty an injury as 
I've seen in 35 years." The injury was so severe that it took 30 minutes for 
Pueschner's leg to be immobilized, and then removed from the field by 
helicopter. And what were Pueschner's final words before leaving the field? 
"Don't forget my Copenhagen."

<TEXT>
<P>
The fairways of Torrey Pines Golf Course are only a long drive away from the 
Charger training camp, but quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver has mapped out his 
own course right on the UC San Diego campus. 
</P>
<P>
See that tree 125 yards away. That's a potential hole. See that park bench 200 
yards in the distance, another likely target. And see that light pole behind 
that dormitory, that, too, could become a bull's-eye. Hazard and all. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of an informal game of pitch and putt that Tolliver and fellow 
quarterback David Archer have developed to break up training camp boredom -- 
and keep that hard-earned off-season handicap from ballooning once the demands 
of the football season intensify. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps keep things loose," Tollvier said. "We call it the 'Training Camp 
Open.' " 
</P>
<P>
Archer and Tolliver make up the golf course as they go. Whoever has honors on 
the tee chooses the target for the next hole. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the challenge of the hole gets them in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We've hit a few buildings," Tolliver said. "But no broken windows. That's the 
way the game is, you make a bad shot you might have to bounce it off a 
building. 
</P>
<P>
"You might even have to play through a classroom. If those students come back 
in September and find a divot in the floor. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Tolliver takes his game seriously. He has a custom golf bag with his 
name on it and claims a four-handicap, "closer to a 3.8," he said. But then, 
Tolliver is from Texas; he has been known to tell a tall tale. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver has come to camp well-equipped for the challenge -- both on the field 
and on the tee. 
</P>
<P>
For golf, he has use of one of the team's electric carts and a full set of 
clubs. Though next year, he said, he would like to add more customized 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have one of those carts shapped like a big Chargers helmet," 
Tolliver said. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Tolliver said he is ready for the challenge of leading the 
Charger offense in only his second season. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come in here and plan on sitting around," Tolliver said. "I'm not a 
guy who believes you have to sit a guy four years before he can play. The only 
way you can get any experience is on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver was 2-3 as a starter last season, and the team won its final two games 
with Tolliver as the starter after he replaced Jim McMahon with four games 
left. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon is gone, having been released in April and signed by Philadelphia two 
weeks ago. Behind Tolliver are Archer, Mark Vlasic and rookie John Friesz, none 
of whom are being set up to contend for the starting job. That is reserved for 
Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
The responsibility is not one he shuns or fears. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here to play," Tolliver said. "So why get nervous about it? You don't 
get nervous about the things that you do. You get nervous about the things 
you're not comfortable with. If had to shoot free throws in front of 40,000 
people, then I would probably be nervous. But throwing passes in front of 
40,000 people is something I do." 
</P>
<P>
Offensive tackle Leo Goeas, a third-round draft choice from Hawaii, is out for 
the season with a foot injury, Coach Dan Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays taken Monday determined that Goeas sustained a broken left foot and a 
torn tendon in practice Sunday, Henning said. No decision will be made about 
possible surgery until the results are known from tests that were to be taken 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Henning had been impressed with Goeas since a strong showing in mini-camp in 
early May and had planned to work him at left tackle. The Chargers are thin 
there because starter Joel Patten is coming off arthroscopic knee surgery about 
seven weeks ago and is not expected to be ready to practice when the veterans 
report Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said the injury provided an opportunity for second-year veteran Joey 
Howard, who made two starts last season, and Eric Floyd, who spent much of last 
season on the developmental squad, to step forward. But he said the team will 
be on the lookout to acquire another tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not out there on aisle 6 next to the ScotTowels and toiletries," 
Henning said. "We're short now, so we've got to be looking." 
</P>
<P>
Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard said the team has inquired around the 
league about the availability of offensive linemen but has found none. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Arthur Cox will be given a few days off after bruising his heal in 
the Monday morning workout, Coach Dan Henning said. . . . Henning said that 
Donald Frank, a rookie free agent cornerback from Winston-Salem State, 
continues to impress him as he has since mini-camp.

MT. CARMEL HIGH NAMES THREE COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mt. Carmel High Athletic Director Frank Andruski announced the hiring of three 
coaches Monday. The vacancies were created by the departure of several Mt. 
</P>
<P>
Carmel coaches for Rancho Bernardo High, which opens this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Andruski named Mike Martino as the water polo coach, Tracey Johnson as the 
girls basketball coach and Paul Robinson as the boys tennis coach. 
</P>
<P>
Martino was an assistant water polo coach last year at Mt. Carmel and worked 
with the freshman and junior varsity from 1986 to 1989. A Mt. Carmel graduate, 
Martino was also the swimming coach at Kearney High. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who played at Mesa College in 1981 and 1982, was a varsity assistant 
to former Mt. Carmel coach Peggy Brose for the past four seasons. Brose left to 
coach girls basketball at Rancho Bernardo. 
</P>
<P>
During those years, Mt. Carmel won Section titles in 1988 and 1990. During her 
high school athletic career, Johnson was selected athlete of the year at Poway 
in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson will remain as the girls tennis coach and will replace Tony Goffredo 
as the boys coach. 
</P>
<P>
Andruski said he has yet to name a baseball, softball, gymnastics and swimming 
coach. DAVE McKIBBEN

REGIONAL EARNINGS: SALES OF EPOGEN SEND AMGEN PROFITS SOARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amgen Inc., a biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks that is reaping the early 
rewards of its new drug Epogen, said its fiscal first-quarter profit soared to 
$11.1 million from $835,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The profit jump came on a surge in Amgen's revenue in the quarter that ended 
June 30, to $71.7 million from $28.5 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The higher revenue reflects growing sales of Epogen, the brand name for 
erythropoietin (EPO), which helps fight anemia in patients with such problems 
as kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen gained federal regulatory approval to sell the drug a year ago, and since 
then it has sold the drug to about 65,000 patients on kidney dialysis, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
As Amgen's sales have continued to gain momentum, so has its stock. Amgen's 
stock closed Monday at $85.50 a share in over-the-counter trading, giving it a 
75% gain since Dec. 31 when it stood at $49 a share. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Amgen has the fledgling EPO market to itself, but that could change. 
Genetics Institute, based in Cambridge, Mass., and its partner, Chugai 
Pharmaceutical Co. of Japan, are fighting a patent battle with Amgen in the 
courts in order to get their version of EPO on the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
The case currently is before an appeals court in Washington, where oral 
arguments are scheduled to be heard in September. A lower court judge had 
effectively urged the companies to share the market.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: NO INQUIRY PLANNED IN PLAYERS' PHONE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A congressman who had raised questions about telephone call-in games does not 
plan to investigate Players International's new game, Players said. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Agoura Hills-based Players made the announcement last week after 
meeting with Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.) and agreeing to cooperate in Gordon's 
overall effort to eliminate abuses in the burgeoning 900-number telephone 
services industry. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon has questioned whether some of the games constitute gambling. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Players announced plans for a 900 version of the "Jeopardy!" TV game 
show, and it is also planning a version of "Wheel of Fortune." 
</P>
<P>
After Gordon's concerns were reported June 13, Players' stock fell 30%, but the 
stock rebounded somewhat after Players said Gordon does not plan to investigate 
its show. The stock closed at $5.375 a share in over-the-counter trading 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Players primarily operates a club that offers discounts to gamblers at casino 
resorts.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LESLIE'S POOLMART TO MAKE 1.9-MILLION SHARE OFFERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leslie's Poolmart, a Chatsworth-based retailer of swimming pool supplies, plans 
to raise about $20 million through an initial public offering of 1.9 million 
common shares, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay part of a $21-million term 
loan that matures in 1996, the filing said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has applied to have the shares listed on the NASDAQ trading 
network. The shares, which are expected to sell for between $9 and $10.50 each 
through Montgomery Securities and Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co., will represent 
about 44% of Leslie's Poolmart after the offering. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also registered 500,000 shares with the SEC that may be sold by 
certain shareholders, including Leslie's Poolmart President Richard H. Hillman, 
chairman and chief executive Michael J. Fourticq, and June Associates of 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie's Poolmart operates 85 stores in 20 states and plans to open another 25 
stores and a Dallas-based distribution center.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: 3-D SYSTEMS EXPECTS TURNAROUND IN 2ND PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
3-D Systems Inc., the Canadian parent of a Valencia company with the same name, 
said it expects to report a profit of between $100,000 and $200,000 when its 
final figures for the second quarter that ended June 30 are released at the end 
of this month. 
</P>
<P>
3-D Systems, which manufactures machines that make three-dimensional plastic 
models or prototypes of objects by using computer-aided designs and lasers, 
lost $984,736 in the second quarter of 1989. Sales in the latest period nearly 
doubled, to $7.1 million from $3.7 million, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
3-D Systems attributed the turnaround in the latest quarter to cost-cutting, 
including layoffs, and to additional marketing efforts.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: ALPHAREL NARROWS ITS LOSS IN 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alpharel of Camarillo, a struggling maker of data storage devices, said it 
narrowed its loss to $77,000 in the second quarter that ended June 30, while 
revenues increased 15% to $1.32 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the year-earlier quarter, the company lost $2.48 million on revenues of 
$1.14 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months that ended in June, Alpharel lost $390,000, contrasted with 
a $4.67 million loss in 1989's first half. Revenues edged up 3% to $2.42 
million from $2.36 million. 
</P>
<P>
Alpharel said it trimmed its losses in the latest periods by a sale to AT&amp;T 
of a license to certain technology, resolving a longstanding dispute between 
the two companies, and by lowering costs.

OPEC URGED TO IMPOSE QUOTAS

Iraq wants no further increases in OPEC oil output or any increases in members' 
production quotas until prices climb to $25 per barrel, the Middle East 
Economic Survey said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The authoritative newsletter said the idea was likely to meet considerable 
resistance among key producers when they meet in Geneva Thursday. But it said 
there was a consensus within OPEC to restore oil prices to more than $18 per 
barrel. World prices are now just below OPEC's $18 benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
An Iranian plan to raise the minimum price to $20 per barrel and then cut 
OPEC's output ceiling and quotas if this is not reached by October stood a good 
chance of being accepted, it added. 
</P>
<P>
The Geneva talks will probably maintain existing quotas for 12 of the 13 
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, while allocating 
a formal quota of 1.5 million barrels per day for the United Arab Emirates, 
making a total ceiling of 22.491 million barrels per day, MEES said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the formula agreed by five Gulf Arab producers, including Iraq, in 
Jeddah two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The quotas would be maintained until prices rise above $18 per barrel or 
possibly higher if the Geneva conference agreed to raise the minimum reference 
target. But this was as far as the consensus went, MEES said. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of where the price would have to reach and for how long in order 
to justify consideration of an increase in the ceiling and quotas, has been 
left open and there are evidently considerable differences of opinion on this 
score," the newsletter said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq last Tuesday launched a stinging attack on Kuwait and the UAE for 
overproducing and forcing down oil prices, saying they were part of the 
U.S.-instigated conspiracy that drove down oil prices by 30% in the first half 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter said Iraq's role in pressuring the UAE and Kuwait to cut 
production was welcomed by most OPEC members, but that there was some dismay 
over its hard-line tactics. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi accusations in the wake of the July 10 Jeddah agreement in which 
Kuwait and the UAE agreed to drastically cut output stunned conservative Gulf 
Arab producers. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq -- which desperately needs higher oil revenues to fund its post-war 
reconstruction program -- also threatened to take unspecified action against 
both countries if they produced above their quotas, as they have in the past.

INCREASED USE OF ETHANOL WOULD BE A BONANZA FOR CORN GROWERS

Production of ethanol, a clean-burning fuel made from corn, could triple in the 
1990s, but only if Congress offers tax breaks and other benefits, a report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Escalation of ethanol production would be good news to corn growers, who would 
see bushel prices climb, and to the Agriculture Department, which could then 
spend less on farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
But congressional investigators also note some possible negatives: lower 
soybean prices, higher prices for cattle feed and increased costs to consumers 
who purchase corn in grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Expanded use of ethanol fuels would have mixed effects on various sectors of 
American agriculture," the General Accounting Office said in the report, which 
was released last week. The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel has great appeal among farm-state lawmakers, especially this year as 
Congress considers new limits on automobile pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers tout ethanol as an environmentalist's dream and a farmer's bonanza. 
When gasoline is blended with ethanol, harmful auto emissions are reduced. If 
the ethanol market picks up, growers would have another use for their corn. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, nearly 1 billion gallons of ethanol were produced. The ethanol 
industry told the GAO it could triple output if Congress dangles some 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
For example, there is a 9-cent tax on each gallon of motor fuel, but the levy 
for gasoline made with ethanol is only 3 cents. The industry would like to keep 
the 6-cent exemption and get a law passed that would order the use of 
alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
If production is tripled, the industry would enjoy an average annual tax break 
of $813 million through 1997, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
While that might hurt the Treasury, the GAO said the greater demand for corn 
would reduce the need to subsidize farmers, saving the government an average of 
$1.42 billion a year.

COMPUTER 'HACKER' AWARDED MACARTHUR GRANT

"Genius grant" recipient Richard Stallman is noted as much for his 
eccentricities as he is for his prodigious talent as a computer programmer. 
</P>
<P>
He can be found in his cluttered office, his hair long and matted, his bare 
feet cradling an open box of crackers on the cot where he sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
Stallman, 37, last week was among 36 recipients of MacArthur Foundation grants. 
</P>
<P>
Stallman, who will receive $240,000 during the next five years, is more than a 
gifted nerd. 
</P>
<P>
In an era when his genius could earn him millions, Stallman eschews material 
possessions and leads a crusade for "free" computer software. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, I could have gone to some company and made a lot of money," said 
Stallman, sitting cross-legged on a couch outside his office. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm more interested in a certain quality of life. When a program is free, 
a community of enthusiasts develops," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The term "free software" does not refer to cost, but to the idea of being able 
to openly share information about computer techniques and applications, in 
contrast to commercial software applications, which are restricted and 
sometimes patented. With free software, people can trade programs and 
information freely, not unlike the idea of one person buying a cassette tape or 
a CD and allowing others to copy them. 
</P>
<P>
Without free software, Stallman argues, computer enthusiasts are unable to 
improve existing programs because their knowledge is restricted. The brave new 
world pioneered by freewheeling computer "hackers" in the 1970s led to a static 
commercial ethic that threatens future progress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not in the public interest, everything has turned into a commercial trade 
secret," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stallman is one of the founders of the League for Programming Freedom, which 
has 135 members. 
</P>
<P>
The group is planning a protest march Aug. 2 at the Cambridge headquarters of 
Lotus Development Corp. A federal judge recently sided with the company, ruling 
it illegal to develop a program that uses the same commands and menus as an 
existing program. 
</P>
<P>
Stallman sees himself as a true hacker. 
</P>
<P>
A Harvard graduate, he began working on the computer system at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1971. In the highly charged atmosphere 
of MIT's artificial intelligence community, he was a legendary hacker, usually 
at his keyboard 10 hours a day, seven days a week for years. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months ago, he developed tendinitis in his hands and now must employ a 
typist to carry out his commands. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm determined not to let it stop me," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
He earns what can be considered little more than stipend money by working 
occasionally as a consultant, but only on what he considers free software. He 
has no grand plans for the no-strings-attached grant, apart from a trip to the 
Soviet Union, where he was invited to meet with programmers. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls the early days in the mid-1970s as near-Utopia in the hacker 
community. But around 1980, when many hackers cashed in on their talents and 
went corporate, Stallman found himself a maverick. 
</P>
<P>
"All software was originally free," said Stallman. "There was a real communal 
feeling. Then, in the '80s, it all changed." 
</P>
<P>
But Stallman stuck to his ideals. He left MIT in 1983 to begin working on the 
development of his own system of free software. His products are priced far 
less than comparable systems, he said. He has a staff of 15 people. 
</P>
<P>
"What I set out to do was to make a complete free system," Stallman said. "I 
want to use nothing but free software." 
</P>
<P>
In the rare hours when he leaves the computer pulsing in his tiny cubicle, 
Stallman socializes with other hackers. He has had a girlfriend for the past 
year, unusual for him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His farewell is always the same: "Happy hacking!"

CRITIC AT LARGE: MPAA RATINGS: A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE, A SYSTEM IN DISARRAY;

The demonstration Tuesday by filmmakers against the ratings system as presently 
constituted and a judge's scathing commentary on that system in a ruling last 
Thursday leave no doubt that the 22-year-old G-to-X notations are in serious 
disarray both inside and outside the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Renaming the X, as Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America, was evidently prepared to do, might have forestalled the crisis. But 
during recent meetings with his major constituents, the big Hollywood studios, 
the notion was rejected. It is tempting to remember what ensued when the horse 
lost one nail from its shoe. 
</P>
<P>
The latter-day moguls seem to have rejected the dumping of X on the grounds 
that it was a weapon to keep unruly filmmakers in line. The real-enough 
economic consequences of an X rating -- limitations on cinemas and on 
advertising -- give force to the contracts with filmmakers that demand no 
stiffer rating than R. 
</P>
<P>
A rating by any other name than X (A or NC for No Children or 17) would let the 
firebrands run amok, was presumably the thinking. This does raise questions 
about who the decision-makers at the studios are these days. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, with X now having an extended lease on life, there is certain to 
be more appeals of X ratings, more films released with no ratings and more 
lawsuits against the system. The suits may be filed largely for their publicity 
value, as New York State Supreme Court Judge Charles E. Ramos said of the 
Miramax suit, but they nevertheless have to be defended, at high cost. The 
ratings may yet be sued out of existence by being unable or unwilling to pay 
the legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
It could be true that the ratings have outlived their usefulness. It may be, as 
producer Robert Radnitz argued in Monday's Calendar, that they never had any 
real usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear is that a crisis of confidence exists, and that Jack Valenti and 
his constituents in production and exhibition have got to reason together, as 
Valenti's old boss Lyndon Johnson liked to say, and figure out how to meet it. 
</P>
<P>
It may well be that if the system is to survive it will have to become purely 
advisory, defining the intensity of films as best it can for the guidance of 
parents especially, but abandoning the last pretenses of policing the box 
office. The X must surely go, but its successor would still alert the 
exhibitors that a given film might, under present law, be actionable if shown 
to those younger than 17 or 18. 
</P>
<P>
This is the only sensible alternative to the suggestions -- implicit if not 
stated in some of the commentaries on the system -- that would have the raters 
making essentially aesthetic or critical judgments. The notion of a "clean" 
rating between R and X would have the raters deciding which was safe sex and 
which dirty, which violence was allowable, which intolerable, which motivations 
pure, which exploitive. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's call for a ratings board that would include psychiatrists and other 
experts rather than just parents is, when thought about at all, a nightmare of 
intrusion in the creative process that would dwarf any of the present cries 
that the ratings constitute censorship. 
</P>
<P>
There are several basic truths about the picture business, but the truth that 
underlies all the others, the foundation upon which the bottom line rests, is 
that the movies (and television) are marketplace commodities. They are subject 
to the iron laws of supply and demand, approval and rejection, the mercurial 
whims of public taste. 
</P>
<P>
What works is repeated; what fails is dropped. When violence stops selling, the 
studios and the networks will try something else. But violence hasn't stopped 
selling and neither has sex, as a look at the movie ads makes clear enough. 
</P>
<P>
The besieged raters are in effect messengers, presently suffering the fate of 
most messengers who carry grim news. The body counts rise, the intensity of the 
couplings grows, the revelations about the deformed and degenerated human 
spirit are grimmer. The raters are saying what's up there, and maybe nobody 
wants to hear it any more. 
</P>
<P>
But that is a question. The judge, in his vividly expressed contempt for the 
movies he sees these days, may be speaking for a much wider public disaffection 
with current movies than the industry cares to admit. The grosses look big, but 
so are the costs of both production and distribution. The vast number of 
screens on which the big pictures play effectively reduces the choices 
filmgoers have. Even the grosses may reflect a skewed idea of the customer's 
real preferences. 
</P>
<P>
This may or may not be a boom time for movies. Where we are on the curve of 
history is not certain. 
</P>
<P>
What the effect of the demolition of the ratings system would be no one can say 
for sure. The perilous political pressures against the National Endowment for 
the Arts are an ironic counterpart to the attacks on the ratings. Who can 
confidently say that comparable censorious forces do not lie in wait for the 
movies? Who would confidently say how Hollywood's product might change if the 
mild enough cautions posed by the ratings were no more? More to the point, who 
would say how the audiences would respond to more of everything except 
compassion? 
</P>
<P>
All that is certain is that the questions won't go away. Jack Valenti, who 
performed a political miracle in 1968 to get the present system OK'd by the 
industry, has a new miracle cut out for him.

RICK DU BROW: 'REAL LIFE' MAY BE A REAL HIT FOR JANE PAULEY

<P>
GOAL TO GO: Round Two tonight for NBC's "Real Life With Jane Pauley." 
</P>
<P>
If the featurish newsmagazine keeps scoring as well in the ratings as in last 
week's premiere, it seems sure to crack the network's regular lineup this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
NBC News President Michael Gartner, eating crow since Pauley was forced off 
"Today," told TV columnists here on their summer tour: 
</P>
<P>
"I wish she were on 'Nightly News' every night with Tom (Brokaw). I wish she 
were on the 'Today' show every morning with Bryant (Gumbel) and Willard (Scott) 
and Deborah (Norville) and everybody else. I wish she were a third co-anchor on 
'Sunday Today.' And I'd like it very much if she'd do the 'news-at-this-hour' 
updates." 
</P>
<P>
He was kidding -- I think. 
</P>
<P>
Pauley says that while many viewers are "pulling for me," she doesn't believe 
that will draw them to the show: "No, I don't. Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
Not forever, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
When the second installment of "Real Life" airs at 10 tonight, its competition 
will be two reruns -- the CBS TV-movie "Tarzan in Manhattan" and ABC's 
"thirtysomething," which Pauley walloped last week. 
</P>
<P>
GUNS OF AUGUST: Two major TV gambles -- the switching of "Twin Peaks" to 
Saturdays and Fox's tossing of "The Simpsons" against "The Cosby Show" -- may 
yield clues to the future within just weeks from now. 
</P>
<P>
But an unexpected first challenge for "Twin Peaks" comes from Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's spooky soap opera begins summer reruns with a repeat of its two-hour 
premiere Sunday, Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
But that's the same night that HBO will present -- at exactly the same time, 
from 9 to 11 -- its concert from Europe, "Madonna -- Live! Blond Ambition World 
Tour 90." 
</P>
<P>
And many of the same viewers who might be part of the "Twin Peaks" audience 
figure to watch Madonna instead. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 23, meanwhile, "The Simpsons" and "The Cosby Show" finally square off, 
although both are in reruns. 
</P>
<P>
It'll be miraculous if "The Simpsons," going into its third rerun cycle, 
continues to hold up. But it's red-hot, and animated shows often fare better in 
repeats than live-action series. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a "Cosby" source is delighted that new "Simpsons" episodes won't 
arrive until mid- or late October. 
</P>
<P>
And NBC, the "Cosby" network, thinks that its longtime champ -- rather than the 
youth-oriented "Simpsons" -- will inherit the older viewers of Dan Rather's "48 
Hours," which is leaving the Thursday time slot. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE ROPES: Filmmaker Roger Corman visits NBC's "Later With Bob Costas" in a 
two-parter starting tonight, and he recalls making "Machine Gun Kelly" with 
Charles Bronson: 
</P>
<P>
"He and I were sparring one time by the side of the set and I kind of put out a 
left. He knocked the left down and came in and very lightly put, I would say, 
20 blows into my stomach within maybe 10 seconds. . . . I never sparred with 
Charlie Bronson again." 
</P>
<P>
NIGHT WATCH: "Saturday Night Live" regular Nora Dunn isn't expected back next 
season, but "she is not being punished" for refusing to appear when Andrew Dice 
Clay was a guest, says NBC's Brandon Tartikoff. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE HOUSE: C-SPAN says you can expect to see more sessions of Britain's 
House of Commons now that the often rowdy, boisterous parliamentary body 
approved permanent TV coverage of its proceedings last week. Much more fun than 
our stuffy old Congress. 
</P>
<P>
UPSTAGED: That cow-calling woman guest was a lot funnier than Roseanne Barr and 
husband Tom Arnold on Johnny Carson's show the other night. 
</P>
<P>
PURIST: A letter-writer asked Dave Letterman, "If Ivory Soap is only 99 and 
44/100% pure, what's the other 56/100% and why is it still in there?" 
</P>
<P>
CHANGE OF HABIT: If you flipped around cable at 10 p.m. Friday, you could have 
seen "Frank's Place" on Black Entertainment Television and "The Days and Nights 
of Molly Dodd" on Lifetime. And that's why some viewers are deserting networks. 
</P>
<P>
FRENCH PASTRY: That was some double feature that KCET Channel 28 ran on 
Saturday night -- Jean Cocteau's "Beauty and the Beast" followed by Max Ophuls' 
"La Ronde." It's the kind of programming that keeps public TV fresh -- and 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
DATE BOOK: We almost missed it, but KCET is packaging Huell Howser's swell 
"Videolog" shorts about Southern California as a weekly half-hour series on 
Thursdays at 7:30 p.m. Title: "Videolog Summer." It repeats Sundays at 6:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
MUSICOLOGY: The usually dependable anchor Jann Carl of KTLA Channel 5 must have 
made Cab Calloway fans cringe when she called his classic song "Minnie and 
Moocher." 
</P>

DISCOVERY: It's been called "the best newscast that no one's ever seen" -- but 
you should seek it out: "World Monitor," with John Hart, on the Discovery 
channel at 4:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. weekdays.

FAST COPY: Strong casting in CBS' new fall series "WIOU," about a failing local 
TV news department -- John Shea, Helen Shaver, Mariette Hartley, Harris Yulin 
and Dick Van Patten. And this exchange between a woman anchor and a producer: 
Anchor -- "I just want to be good." Producer: "And they (management) just want 
you to be good-looking."

FINE WINE: Told myself I wouldn't watch Billy Wilder's "Sabrina" again last

BRAHMS AND PREMIERES AT CABRILLO FEST

No fewer than nine premieres enlivened the weekend concerts at the 28th 
Cabrillo Music Festival. Yet, what dominated the musical landscape, after these 
programs had been given, were performances of music by Brahms. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, Ursula Oppens happened to be the pianist of these performances 
-- of the Second Piano Concerto on Friday night and the Variations and Fugue on 
a Theme by Handel on Saturday evening. If neither of Oppens' readings turned 
out definitive, or even hair-raising, they both at least had solidity and 
seriousness in their favor. And the large-scale works by themselves commanded 
the ear and our attention. 
</P>
<P>
At the Friday Festival Orchestra concert, conductor Dennis Russell Davies and 
his game colleagues disappointed with a one-dimensional run-through of the 
B-flat Concerto -- a reading full of spirit but lacking Brahmsian detail and 
contrast. 
</P>
<P>
Oppens played respectably, but failed in nobility and authority -- she 
struggled where she should have reigned. 
</P>
<P>
Proving once again his gift for making provocative programs, music director 
Davies preceded Brahms with three reported West Coast premieres. 
</P>
<P>
"Preambulo" by the Puerto Rican composer Roberto Sierra (born 1953) turned out 
to be a showy and brilliant overture, and a highly eclectic mix of 20th-Century 
styles not unlike many film scores -- and just as forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
A revival of the Violin Concerto in G (1772) by the West Indian Joseph 
Boulogne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, became a happy vehicle to display once 
again the accomplishments of Romuald Tecco, longtime concertmaster of this 
festival. Through all technical hurdles -- and a most affecting and probing and 
Mozartean slow movement -- the patrician, virtuosic Tecco excelled, seconded 
lovingly by his orchestral colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Oppens was the able soloist in "Kabiosile," Tania Leon's six-minute scherzo, a 
vehement statement of exotic aspect. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, in a characteristically Californian setting -- a church in a 
shopping center immediately off a freeway ramp -- Oppens gave one of the most 
fascinating recital programs imaginable. She was hampered by an acoustical 
situation hostile to resonance, but she triumphed anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In Resurrection Church in Aptos (south of Santa Cruz), Oppens offered an agenda 
beginning with Stravinsky's urbane and still-wondrous Sonata (1924). 
</P>
<P>
There were other, deeper revelations here: the emotional context and Russian 
heritage shared by the Four Studies, Opus 7, by Stravinsky, and Rachmaninoff's 
"Etudes-Tableaux," Opus 33, written in 1911; the open-heartedness of Brahms' 
variations, Opus 24, in contrast to the mechanistic devices of Nancarrow's 
robotic "Two Canons for Ursula" (1989). 
</P>
<P>
In the same hall Saturday afternoon, five works from the California Composers 
Project were unveiled by the Festival Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The players' patience was sorely tried with this event. Only Charles Shere's 
spare but gloomy Concerto for Violin and Harp, Percussion and Small Orchestra 
(1985) deserved such a showcase. 
</P>
<P>
Shere's brooding and intense concerto, an essay in small, telling musical 
gestures, occupies its 15 minutes engagingly. It was performed sensitively by 
violinist Beni Shinohara, solidly accompanied by the orchestra led by Ken 
Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend also included the festival's annual trek to San Juan Bautista for 
two concerts that did not exactly live up to the promise: "Masterpieces at the 
Mission." 
</P>
<P>
William Schuman's pre-World War II paean to American optimism, the 
now-embarrassingly-dated Third Symphony (1941) received a linear, 
conviction-rich reading, and the Festival Orchestra came close to making this 
cloying work as noble as many wish it were. 
</P>
<P>
The resourceful, vigorous players were even more successful in ennobling two 
recent works by North Americans, Henry Brant's post-impressionistic "The Desert 
Forests," (1983) and Philip Glass' "The Light" (1987). 
</P>
<P>
"The Light," the composer's first large-orchestra work, plays with colorful and 
granitic chords, flashes of melodic interplay and shifting harmonies for 23 
engaging minutes. In Davies' evocative performance, the work progresses from 
lyrical introspection to triumphal catharsis with a sense of inevitability. 
</P>
<P>
Three virtuosos -- violist Hans Brunig, cellist Othello Liesmann and bassist 
Wolfgang Guttler -- make up the novel ensemble, Trio Basso, which brought its 
unconventional repertory to the Mission Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
They failed to prove that their low-voiced combination is a charming or sexy 
one. Indeed, in recent works by Wolfgang Rihn, Manfred Niehaus, Rolf Riehm and 
Hans-Joachim Hespos, they proved only that a little musical violence, some 
comedic archness and a lot of aural space between notes can be just as tedious 
as academic exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy-handed humor became the strongest element in this competently performed 
concert.

HOUSE PASSES CHILDREN'S TV BILL TO SET LIMITS ON ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARI GRANVILLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bill aimed at limiting commercial aspects of children's television moved a 
step closer to President Bush's desk Monday when it was unanimously approved by 
the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Swift action by the House had been expected following last Thursday's approval 
in the Senate of a nearly identical children's TV package. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Senate bill, the House measure would re-establish advertising time 
limits in children's programming, on both broadcast stations and on cable 
channels. Commercials would be limited to 12 minutes per hour on weekdays and 
10 1/2 minutes on weekends -- standards already being met by most broadcasters 
and cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill also requires broadcasters to show how they have met the 
"educational and informational needs" of children in their overall programming 
when seeking license renewal from the Federal Communications Commission. During 
the deregulation-oriented 1980s, license renewal had become a routine matter of 
mailing in a postcard. 
</P>
<P>
The final provision of the House bill instructs the FCC to conclude a 
court-ordered inquiry into toy-based children's programs, which proliferated in 
the years following deregulation in 1984. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), 
sponsor of the bill, said that Monday's passage "will provide broadcasters and 
children's program producers with the necessary incentives to educate our 
nation's children creatively rather than to exploit them economically." 
</P>
<P>
The House bill differed from the Senate measure in one significant way: It does 
not include a mandate establishing a National Endowment for Children's 
Television, which would administer grants to produce children's programs. 
</P>
<P>
That difference between the two measures means that the House measure now 
returns to the Senate before going to a conference committee, which will work 
out the final proposal to be sent to President Bush.KARI GRANVILLE

The California Highway Patrol said 925 people died in traffic accidents during 
a nine-month period solely because they were not wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
A CHP study concluded that 48% of the 1,913 people killed in traffic accidents 
between Sept. 1, 1989, and July 1, 1990, would have survived if they had been 
wearing safety belts. "That's 925 people in a nine-month period who died 
needlessly, in the sense that they would be alive today if only they had 
buckled up," CHP Commissioner Maury Hannigan said. The study counted only 
accidents in CHP jurisdictions.

Two ticket-holders -- one from San Francisco and the other from Los Angeles -- 
shared the $30,120,000 grand prize in the weekend "Lotto 6-53" drawing, 
according to state lottery officials. 
</P>
<P>
Cecelia Gaddini, 66, a retired city worker from the Bay Area, said she was 
"still in shock" and doesn't know what she will do with 20 annual checks of 
$602,400 each, after taxes. The Los Angeles winner was not immediately 
identified. Fourteen tickets contained five of six winning numbers, plus the 
bonus number, each winning its owner $66,582, officials said.

DODGERS GET FAST START IN BEATING WHO-ARE-THEYS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hobbled San Francisco Giants took the field against the Dodgers Monday as a 
collective argument for putting first names on uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
There was a guy playing first base named Leach. A guy on second named Litton. 
One in right field named Leonard. The catcher was Manwaring. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, countering with guys named Murray, Brooks and Daniels, needed only 
two innings to show what you don't know can't hurt you. 
</P>
<P>
Using home runs by Eddie Murray and Hubie Brooks and a two-run double by Kal 
Daniels, the Dodgers scored nine runs in the first two innings in winning, 
11-1, before 42,202. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a different lineup, for sure," said Mike Sharperson, whose Dodgers 
had not seen the Giants since April 30. 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged: "But I don't think we dwelled on it." 
</P>
<P>
The third-place Dodgers are now beginning dwell on second place, moving to 
within 2 1/2 games of the Giants while remaining 13 1/2 games behind 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The largest Monday crowd since opening day saw the biggest Dodger winning 
margin of the season, back-to-back Dodger homers for just the second time this 
season and the most runs by a Dodger team since May 27. 
</P>
<P>
They also saw Fernando Valenzuela's best outing since his June 29 no-hitter. 
Valenzuela (8-8) was needed for only six innings, allowing one run on four hits 
with four strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The fans even saw a high-speed chase featuring the team's premier Keystone Kop, 
Mickey Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
With Jose Vizcaino on first base and one out in the eighth inning, Hatcher, 
batting for reliever Tim Crews, lined a ball down the right-field line. While 
Vizcaino was scoring, Hatcher was rounding first and second and, surprisingly, 
sliding into third base just ahead of the relay throw from second baseman 
Ernest Riles. 
</P>
<P>
Riles' throw rolled past the base and deep into foul territory. This is where 
Hatcher made his first mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"I never should have gotten up and run home," Hatcher said, smiling. "I should 
have just stayed put." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hatcher stood up and took off. Except his legs argued. Halfway to the 
plate, his knees began to knock. Several feet short of the plate, he fell on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. "His legs wouldn't let 
him move." 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher crawled across the plate, slapping it as he turned and sprawled on his 
back in exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
"Vizcaino was yelling for me to score standing up. . . . He didn't know what to 
do," Hatcher said. "Hey, I just hope we can turn this season around and make it 
exciting for the fans." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have lost a season-high five consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark, batting .429 against the Dodgers this year, was on the bench Monday 
after fouling a ball off his right foot Sunday in Chicago. The bruised foot was 
X-rayed with negative results, and Manager Roger Craig said he was going to 
rest him anyway, but before the game Clark said the foot was still hurting. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get well, I will run out there like I always do, but I can't do it on 
one foot," said Clark, batting .280 with 14 homers and 65 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sharperson: "Every time Clark is in there, it's like he's a presence. So, 
you wonder if that didn't affect the outlook." 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Robby Thompson was out with a sore back, and catcher Gary Carter 
is on the disabled list with a bruised right shoulder. Shortstop Jose Uribe was 
being rested. 
</P>
<P>
The only recognizeable veterans were Matt Williams, Kevin Mitchell and Brett 
Butler. Craig started Rick Leach at first, Greg Litton at second and catcher 
Kirt Manwaring. And, in an odd but forced maneuver against the left-handed 
Valenzuela, Craig gave left-handed hitting Mark Leonard his first major league 
start in right field. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him Valenzuela was right-handed," Craig said. "He said, 'OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was not OK for left-handed Giant starter Trevor Wilson, 24, who earlier this 
year had carried no-hitters into the ninth and seventh innings. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Javier, playing for a resting Kirk Gibson, broke up this no-hit bid within 
seconds, leading off the Dodger first inning with a single to left. Two outs 
later on an 0-and-2 pitch, Murray homered to center, his 14th overall and 
second in his last six at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
On a 3-and-0 fastball, Brooks followed with a homer to left, his 11th of the 
season. The only other Dodger back-to-back homers this year were hit by Gibson 
and Daniels on June 8 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers were just getting started. Juan Samuel led off the second inning 
with a walk and one out later was bunted to second by Valenzuela. The Dodgers 
then scored six runs with two out. 
</P>
<P>
Javier singled in a run. Sharperson singled. Daniels doubled in two runs, 
taking the team lead with 50 RBIs. His career high is 64. 
</P>
<P>
After Daniels' double, Randy O'Neal replaced Wilson. He intentionally walked 
Murray, but then Brooks singled to score another run. Rick Dempsey, who entered 
with six RBIs in 63 at-bats, then drove in two more with a double down the left 
field line. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The bar fight involving the Dodger middle infielders Saturday morning in 
Pittsburgh started when Alfredo Griffin jokingly told a woman he was Pirate 
second baseman Jose Lind, two sources have confirmed. Sources say the woman 
then asked for Griffin's autograph, which started an argument between her and a 
male companion. Griffin and Juan Samuel then allegedly attempted to calm the 
man, causing busboy Wilson Sturgeon Jr. to intervene. Griffin and Samuel are 
charged with assaulting Sturgeon and are scheduled to appear for a preliminary 
hearing in Pittsburgh's City Court July 31. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin was easy to spot Monday. He was the only player wearing sunglasses 
during batting practice. Griffin was protecting his left eye, which is still 
swollen and infected after it was scratched and punched during the fight. He 
missed his third consecutive start and today will be examined by 
ophthalmologist Matthew Bernstein. If Griffin is placed on the disabled list, 
look for triple-A shortstop Jose Offerman to join the team. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Jarrin returned to the Dodger broadcast booth for Spanish-language KWKW 
radio (1330) for the first time since suffering internal injuries in an 
automobile accident March 26. "I am so thrilled and thankful to be here," said 
Jarrin, who nearly died in the spring training crash in Vero Beach, Fla. "The 
only regret I have is that I was not here for Fernando Valenzuela's no-hitter." 
Jarrin, who served as Valenzuela's interpreter during the days of Fernandomania 
in the early 1980s, left the June 29 game against St. Louis in the first inning 
because of fatigue. He normally works seven innings of a broadcast but worked 
just four innings on Monday and will gradually increase his time.

Mark Gastineau, former New York Jet defensive end, has been placed on waivers 
by the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Under CFL rules, if the 33-year-old Gastineau clears waivers, the Lions could 
place him on their practice roster. Because of Gastineau's large personal 
services contract with Lion Owner Murray Pezim, it's unlikely that another CFL 
team would claim him.

While acknowledging major rules violations in its football and basketball 
programs, the University of Florida insists that a compliance program in effect 
since 1984 is working. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the IRS (Internal Revenue Service)," school president John V. 
Lombardi said. "You can't prevent people from doing the wrong thing." 
</P>
<P>
Florida acknowledged in a 1,100-page response to an official letter of inquiry 
from the NCAA that former coaches Galen Hall and Norm Sloan ran afoul of the 
rules. It denied, however, that infractions occurring from 1985 to 1988 
demonstrated a lack of institutional control over the football and basketball 
programs run by the coaches.

SOME UNLV PLAYERS WANT TO SUE NCAA OVER POSTSEASON PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney representing several Nevada Las Vegas basketball players said 
Monday that he has been asked to try to overturn the NCAA decision barring the 
defending national champions from postseason play next season. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones I've spoken to are quite hurt and they want action," attorney Stephen 
Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel they should not be penalized for something that occurred when they 
were 6 or 7 years old." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA announced Friday that it was taking its action because the university 
had not suspended Coach Jerry Tarkanian, as ordered, in 1977. Tarkanian sued 
the NCAA over his suspension and won a court order preventing it. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV officials said earlier that they would not go to court to battle the NCAA 
and would work within the organization's guidelines in appealing the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, All-American forward Larry Johnson said that he will return to 
Nevada Las Vegas for his senior season. He and other UNLV seniors would be 
allowed to transfer and be eligible to play immediately because of the penalty.

HOLDOUT ENDS FOR NO. 1 PICK

After signing a long-term contract, Anthony Smith, the Raiders' No. 1 draft 
pick, arrived at training camp Monday and pulled aside Coach Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to apologize for being late," Shell said of the defensive end who 
ended a weeklong holdout. "But I told him that we're just happy to have him 
here and we want to just move forward." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "Any time a guy's not here he's going to fall behind. But I'll make 
it back up." He practiced for the first time Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have high expectations for Smith, the 11th player selected in the 
draft. A 6-foot-3, 265-pound All-Pacific 10 Conference selection from Arizona, 
Smith was one of the best pass rushers in college football last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to prove anything," Smith said. "Al Davis drafted me because he 
has confidence in my ability and my skills as a football player. That's all." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders hope to move Smith into the lineup slowly. He is projected as the 
backup to Scott Davis at left end, and he might play tackle when the Raiders 
employ an extra pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith was one of the best pass rushers in this draft," Shell said. "He's very 
explosive and has the ability to come off the corner and rush the passer and 
play the run." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jay Lawrence, who covers the Raiders for the Orange County Register, was banned 
Monday from watching the team practice because he has accepted a job covering 
the Denver Broncos at a Denver newspaper, the Rocky Mountain News. The Raiders 
apparently feared Lawrence, who will continue to work for the Register until he 
switches jobs next month, might give away secrets. Lawrence will be allowed to 
interview players and attend Coach Art Shell's daily press conference. "It 
seems a little ridiculous," Lawrence said. "I'm certainly not going to go 
running to anyone with the Denver Broncos and tell them what I've seen here." 
Mark Tomaszewski, Register sports editor, called Raider executive John Herrera 
to ask for an explanation. "(Herrera) said they're treating Jay as an 
out-of-town reporter, and he's just following orders that Al Davis gave him," 
Tomaszewski said. Herrera refused comment.

<P>
Peruvian President-elect Alberto Fujimori takes office Thursday having lost the 
support of many former leftist allies because of what they consider the former 
educator's turn to the right since beating novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in 
national elections last month. 
</P>
<P>
His coalition Cabinet, meant to overcome narrow political divisions, has the 
largest military presence of any Peruvian government since 1987. Hurtado 
Miller, a center-right agronomist and economist, is the prime minister 
designate -- a less powerful post than the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Japanese immigrants, the new president inherits a ruined economy and 
a stalemated war with two leftist guerrilla insurgencies.

The fractious membership of OPEC, the world's most exclusive oil club, will

</P>
<P>
On the table will be a raise in the target price that the 13 member nations 
charge for a barrel of benchmark oil from $18 to $20. Iran, citing recent 
pledges by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to stay within their assigned 
production quotas, thinks the time is ripe for such an increase. 
</P>

Meanwhile, Iraq is making thinly veiled threats against Kuwait if it violates 
quotas that come out of the Geneva meeting.

The U.S. decision to open direct talks with Vietnam and drop its support at the 
United Nations for the three-faction Cambodian resistance coalition is expected 
to dominate this week's annual meeting of the six-member Assn. of Southeast 
Asian Nations in Indonesia. 
</P>

Leaders from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and 
Singapore will be able to question U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
directly when he arrives for the end of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
ASEAN considers an end to the 11-year-old war in neighboring Cambodia vital to 
its efforts to create a stable and prosperous region and has taken a leading 
role in so-far fruitless efforts to broker a peace agreement. Delegates will 
also try to reverse U.S. opposition to forcible repatriation of Vietnamese 
"boat people."

THE WARSAW PACT IS DEBATING ITS FUTURE AS ITS CREDIBILITY AS AN ARMED THREAT IS

WARSAW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the disintegrating, seven-nation Warsaw Pact has one foot in the grave, 
some members are desperately trying to keep a tombstone from being placed over 
the remains. 
</P>
<P>
The prognosis looks bleak, and there are widespread predictions of the demise 
of the organization, which was formed here in 1955 as a Communist counter to 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to live with this collective dinosaur for a while, but nobody 
takes the Warsaw Pact seriously any longer," commented a diplomatic observer 
here. "The only issue is how to get rid of it gracefully," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The pact is defunct as far as mounting an offensive against the West," added a 
military specialist in the Polish capital. 
</P>
<P>
But Moscow and a few of its allies hope to breathe life back into the pact by 
emphasizing a new political role for the organization -- long considered the 
most dangerous military threat to Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet military, which has run the Warsaw Treaty Organization as an 
extension of the Red Army, insists that the alliance should hang together as 
long as there is a military threat from NATO. And even some Western specialists 
believe that a liberalized Warsaw Pact could serve a useful purpose. 
</P>
<P>
As a NATO planner in Brussels put it: "I would not like to write it off 
entirely. For instance, in the conventional arms negotiations at Vienna, it is 
easier to deal with the pact members as a group than as seven separate 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
Further, NATO has proposed the signing of a non-aggression treaty with members 
of the Warsaw Pact, and such an act might pump life back into the moribund 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Of the members -- the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania -- Poland has appeared among the most eager to 
retain whatever protective power the organization provides. This is mainly 
because of the Poles' fear of a united Germany -- a nation of 80 million people 
who, some here still fear, might try to recover former German lands ceded to 
Poland after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two sources for our worries," Bronislaw Maria Komorowski, an 
assistant defense minister of Poland, told a visitor. "I inherited my name from 
my uncle, who was executed by the Germans in the war. He inherited his name 
from an uncle who was murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1920. The Warsaw Pact may 
offer us protection in both directions. But if we keep it, it must fully 
respect the principle of partnership." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Bulgaria, which also has historic rivals on its borders, is less 
eager than some of its allies, such as Hungary, to disband the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Kalin Mitrev, a Moscow-educated diplomat and a ranking member of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party, said in an interview in Sofia: "There is a half-million-strong 
Turkish army directed against Bulgaria. We have to think about that. Until we 
have fully achieved a level of integration with Europe, in order to prevent a 
Cyprus situation developing here, we need strong support from everyone, 
especially from our historic allies." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow wants to restructure the pact into a predominantly political 
organization "of sovereign states with equal rights, based on democratic 
principles" even as it falters as a credible military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
For Moscow is embarrassed by the fact that its troops are left in countries 
where they are no longer welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a rundown on the military status of the Soviet Union's six 
sometime-allies in East Europe: 
</P>
<P>
* East Germany -- Long considered the most formidable military power among the 
Soviet satellites. The East German armed forces, which only a year ago had 
170,000 well-disciplined men, are now in a state of near-collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, unification of Germany, expected this year, means the eastern 
sector will no longer be a member of the Warsaw Pact, but affiliated with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the greater part of the Soviet forces the Kremlin has deployed beyond 
its national borders are stationed in East Germany -- an elite army of 380,000 
men in at least 17 combat divisions. 
</P>
<P>
That's why it was such a breakthrough last week when Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed on the withdrawal of 
Red army forces in three or four years after unification. 
</P>
<P>
* Poland -- Strong armed forces of about 400,000 men, including the so-called 
Internal Defense troops. Heavy divisions are concentrated along the western 
border with East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Military attaches say the Polish army, made up largely of conscripts, is 
professional, well-trained and well-disciplined. "They would fight to the last 
man if Poland were attacked," one military specialist said, "but the Soviets 
could not count on the Poles to fight anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Komorowski, the assistant defense minister, said, "We will act only in a 
defensive way and only on Polish territory against any threat." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet army maintains two army divisions in Poland, about 40,000 men and 
300 aircraft, but this force seems to serve mainly as a communications and 
logistics chain between the Soviet forces in East Germany and the Soviet Union. 
And the logic of maintaining this force will disappear as those Soviet troops 
in Germany are brought home. 
</P>
<P>
* Czechoslovakia -- A well-equipped armed force of about 200,000 men. Defense 
Minister Miroslav Vacek said he is seeking ways to reduce the force level by 
25%. He would abolish conscription in favor of a volunteer force. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I think the Czechs would find that too expensive," a Western 
military attache said. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak army, which did not fight when Germany seized the Sudetenland 
in 1938 and did not oppose the 1968 invasion by Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces, 
does not have a high reputation at home. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't find the same respect for the army here that you have in East 
Germany and Poland," an analyst in Prague said. 
</P>
<P>
Until a year ago, the Soviets kept five Red Army combat divisions in 
Czechoslovakia, but significant numbers of troops and equipment have already 
been pulled out, and the rest are to be gone within a year. 
</P>
<P>
* Hungary -- About 90,000 men in uniform. The loudest call for breaking up the 
military marriage in East Europe has come from Budapest, where politicians have 
declared the 35-year-old military bloc a useless relic. Col. Gyorgy Keleti, a 
spokesman for the Defense Ministry, described the pact by quoting an old 
saying: "When a woman is dead, you don't have to divorce her." 
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 Soviet troops in the country began going home last March under an 
agreement between Moscow and Budapest. The withdrawal is to be completed by 
next July 1. More recently, the Hungarian government said it would remove its 
armed forces from Warsaw Pact control in anticipation of official withdrawal 
from the alliance by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungary did not choose to join the Warsaw Pact of its own free will," Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky said, "and it's doubtful whether the pact had any 
positive function or role to play at any time. But at the same time, it is a 
valid treaty based on international law, and a unilateral break cannot be 
made." 
</P>
<P>
After new East-West arms arrangements are worked out in Vienna, Hungarian 
diplomats say, the country will establish a small army that would be part of a 
new pan-European security accord. 
</P>
<P>
* Bulgaria -- About 117,000 men in uniform. There are no Soviet troops on 
Bulgarian soil and, according to military observers, Bulgaria has never posed 
much of a threat to NATO, particularly since strong NATO members Greece and 
Turkey lie on Bulgaria's southern flank. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian officials tend to regard the Warsaw alliance as worth preserving, at 
least for the short term, mainly because of Bulgaria's fear of the massive 
Turkish armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops did not occupy Bulgaria after World War II because local leaders 
readily accepted the Communist ideology, which had to be imposed on other East 
European countries. This absence of a Soviet occupation force has spared 
Bulgarians much of the resentment felt by other Warsaw Pact nations. 
</P>
<P>
* Romania -- About 171,000 men under arms before the revolution of last 
December. Like Bulgaria, Romania has not had to put up with Soviet occupation 
troops, and it too plans to reduce its armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Romania was the least enthusiastic member of the Warsaw Pact, 
barring Soviet troops and joint maneuvers from its territory. It refused to 
take part in the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, yet despite last December's 
violent revolution, it continues to be one of the more loyal members of the 
Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
"We are for the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact," Gen. Vasile Ionel, chief of 
the Romanian general staff, said recently, "but simultaneous with the 
dissolution of NATO. As long as the Warsaw Pact exists, we will fulfill the 
obligations we assumed." 
</P>
<P>
Ionel described the efforts of countries like Hungary to break away from the 
Warsaw Treaty Organization as "destabilizing." 
</P>
<P>
So Moscow's next steps to keep the Warsaw Pact from being disbanded remain 
uncertain: It will never be a heavyweight again, although it may continue as a 
hollow shell. 
</P>
<P>
"The Warsaw Pact doesn't have an address, a building to sit in or a secretary 
general," commented a senior NATO official. "We have invited them to speak to 
us here as individual nations. If some of the members can convert it into a 
genuine political partnership, it may have some limited future, otherwise the 
pact is on its way out." 
</P>

Players in the Warsaw Pact 
</P>
<P>
EAST GERMANY: Its army in a state of collapse, it remains the place where 
Soviets have most troops on foreign soil -- 380,000. 
</P>
<P>
POLAND: With about 400,000 under arms, its military is considered a strong 
weapon -- but only if Poland is attacked. 
</P>
<P>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA: Army is well-equipped but not highly regarded at home. 
Officials are seeking ways to reduce its size. 
</P>
<P>
HUNGARY: Loudest of East Europe nations in demanding breakup of Warsaw Pact, it 
plans to withdraw its military from pact control. 
</P>
<P>
BULGARIA: Seen as little threat to NATO, Bulgaria would generally favor 
retaining Warsaw Pact because of its fear of Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
ROMANIA: Like Bulgaria, it has no Soviet troops on its soil. Romania favors 
dissolving Warsaw Pact only if NATO meets the same fate.

(MPRP), as the Communists are officially known, will face off against an 
opposition coalition. The elections culminate eight months of dramatic 
political liberalization in the landlocked nation of 2 million people. . . . 
Political change is paired with growing openness to the world. Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III is due to visit Ulan Bator on Aug. 2-5 for talks on 
bilateral relations, including a plan to dispatch U.S. Peace Corps volunteers 
to Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
The System: 
</P>
<P>
Voters will elect representatives to five-year terms in Mongolia's supreme 
legislative body, the 430-member People's Great Hural. Members of provincial 
and local governmental bodies will also be chosen. Preliminary elections were 
held last Sunday to narrow the number of candidates to two in each district. 
The Great Hural, which convenes once a year, elects the president of Mongolia. 
It also will establish a routinely functioning legislature, the 53-member Small 
Hural, based partly on a party preference vote that will be included in 
Sunday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
At Stake: 
</P>
<P>
The elections mark a key step in the transformation of Mongolia's political and 
economic life toward a system closer to Western-style democratic capitalism. 
Even the opposition seems to view the elections primarily as a part of this 
process, rather than as a chance to take control of the government. 
</P>
<P>
The elections "will become a basis for (the) soonest switching over to a full 
market economy, parliamentary democracy and promotion of pluralism of views," 
predicted Sanjaasuren Zorig, head of the Mongolian Democratic Assn., the first 
and most prominent opposition group in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The elections also should help Mongolia's moves to loosen its extremely close 
69-year-old ties with the Soviet Union and to develop closer relations with 
rich industrialized democracies. President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, in a May 
speech to the Great Hural, said reform of Mongolia's political structure is 
important not only for the country's "socioeconomic and cultural renewal" but 
also for its "foreign policy construction." 
</P>
<P>
Background: 
</P>
<P>
Change in Mongolia reflects the rapid liberalization that has swept the old 
Soviet bloc. Rapid democratization began here in December, when dissidents 
twice held demonstrations in Ulan Bator. Protests escalated in January and 
February. The ruling party responded with a conciliatory stance, pledging a 
gradual transition toward a multi-party democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties complained in June that proposed election procedures were 
unfair and threatened a boycott. But after winning concessions, they said they 
would participate. 
</P>
<P>
Ochirbat, in a July interview with the MPRP-controlled newspaper Unen, said 
that "all existing political parties lack experience, which leads to some 
errors and mistakes during the election campaign." He called for "flexibility 
and mutual dialogue in the settlement of any problems or disagreements 
concerning the elections." 
</P>
<P>
Parties: 
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party established the world's second 
Communist state after coming to power in 1921 with Soviet backing. It dropped 
the word "communism" from its party constitution in April, setting the new goal 
of building "democratic humane socialism." It now favors market-oriented 
economic reforms. In a concession to the opposition, the MPRP says it is 
suspending the political activity of its branches in army, militia and state 
security organs from mid-July until after formation of the new Great Hural and 
Small Hural. 
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian Democratic Party, the country's first opposition party, was 
created in February, even before such action was legal. Its parent organization 
is the Mongolian Democratic Assn. The MDP has called for the ruling party and 
opposition to work together to "speed up economic, political and social 
development . . . and take better care of the poor, the handicapped and those 
victimized in years of repression." 
</P>
<P>
The National Progress Party was established primarily by a group of young 
economists. "Our party's major goal is to support progressive national 
traditions in close combination with every progressive idea appearing in the 
world," Dagvasurengiyn Ganbold, chairman of the party, said in a June interview 
with Radio Ulan Bator. "The Mongols since ancient times have respected and 
advocated free ideology, and there was no tradition of repressing people of 
different ideology." The party wishes to restore this spirit of tolerance, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other parties contesting the elections include the Social Democratic Party, the 
Party of Free Labor and the environmentalist Green Party. All but the Party of 
Free Labor are cooperating in an opposition coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Personalities: 
</P>
<P>
The mastermind of the opposition movement has been Mongolian Democratic Assn. 
leader Zorig, whose background paradoxically is as a scholar of Marxism. A 
colorless speaker, Zorig, 27, who is half Russian, makes up in organizational 
talent what he lacks in charisma. 
</P>
<P>
President Ochirbat formerly headed the ministries of fuel and power, and of 
geology. The MPRP is headed by Gombojavyn Ochirbat (no relation to the 
president), a former trade union president and head of party ideology who faced 
official criticism in the early 1980s. He was elected party chief in March, 
only days after returning to Ulan Bator from two years spent in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: 
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian Democratic Party claims that polls show its support in some major 
cities at about 40% to 50%. But the MPRP says it has majority support among 
urbanites. The ruling party is presumed to have a strong edge in the 
countryside, where livestock herders are unfamiliar with democratic procedures 
and have only limited knowledge about the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
MPRP officials, in a concession made early this month, promised that even if 
their party dominates the election, the opposition will be given some positions 
in the new Council of Ministers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite understandable that newly set up political parties cannot compete 
with the MPRP that has been ruling the country for 70 years now, in terms of 
membership, finance and reputation," National Progress Party Chairman Ganbold 
said in a June interview with Radio Ulan Bator. "This year's elections must 
become a step forward in the development of democracy in the genuine sense. 
Herein lies the main significance of the participation of the democratic 
forces."

'WHERE IS THIS FIRST WORLD, ANYWAY?'; 
</P>
<P>
LONDON CERTAINLY SEEMS AS IF IT SHOULD BE SAFE, CLEAN AND CIVILIZED. BUT AFTER 
LIVING IN NEW DELHI'S THIRD WORLD, A REPORTER FINDS THAT SOME THINGS AREN'T SO 
DIFFERENT AFTER ALL.

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The assignment had all the makings of a summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
After eight years of living with riots, revolution, war and deprivation in the 
lower third of Asia's Third World, I was put on a plane from New Delhi to 
London on temporary assignment -- in my editors' words, "to taste the First 
World and all it has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
But within the first few days of my landing in this urban citadel of the First 
World the following happened: 
</P>
<P>
* A terrorist bomb ripped through a private supper club of Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party located just a few blocks from my hotel. 
</P>
<P>
* Rampaging mobs of English soccer fans rioted across the country. 
</P>
<P>
* Another bomb blew up in a trash bin half a block from the central London 
hotel where President Bush and other First World leaders were having breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
* And London's legendary underground and surface transport systems were 
repeatedly snarled by bomb scares, breakdowns and anonymous "technical faults." 
</P>
<P>
"I must've taken a wrong turn at Bangladesh," I commented to a colleague in the 
midst of it all. We were standing among drug dealers and car thieves in a 
dilapidated London housing project where, a few days before, three police 
officers had been attacked and beaten during a drug bust. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, where is this First World, anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
My colleague smiled knowingly. "This is it, my friend," he said, nodding. "You 
can run, but you can't hide." 
</P>
<P>
True enough. 
</P>
<P>
In an era when the boundaries between nations are crumbling under the weight of 
a new, pragmatic world order, the distinctions between the so-called First and 
Third Worlds seem to be disintegrating faster than the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Terrorism is now a household word from Bombay to Bahrain and Belfast to Boston. 
And there is hardly a country left on Earth that can claim to be drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
They're smoking crack now from Calcutta to Kuwait, battling AIDS from Manila to 
Malta and mopping up oil spills from Alaska to Aberdeen. Similarly, Asian gang 
warfare has been transplanted to the streets of Los Angeles, Sydney and 
Liverpool. 
</P>
<P>
South American drug cartels are exporting executions and street violence along 
with their multibillion-dollar trade. 
</P>
<P>
But in all the world, there are perhaps few better laboratories in which to 
study this phenomenon of global shrinking -- the gradual merging of the 
planet's First and Third Worlds -- than in London, my new summer home, and in 
New Delhi, which has been my home for five of the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the two cities seem worlds apart. 
</P>
<P>
Brutality is a way of life in New Delhi, the capital of an impoverished nation 
of 850 million people, where beggars bang the stumps of amputated arms against 
the windows of cars at intersections, where nearly a third of the population 
lives in squatters' shanties, where grooms' families burn brides to death over 
insufficient dowries and where human waste commingles with uncollected garbage 
on many city streets. 
</P>
<P>
London, by contrast, has Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and the West End, where 
alfresco diners sip fine French Champagne, down pints of the world's best ale 
and savor continental cuisine along centuries-old cobblestone lanes. 
</P>
<P>
But scratch the surface, and the similarities are there. 
</P>
<P>
Take food, for example. 
</P>
<P>
In Delhi, vast families of flies blanket what passes for beef at the local 
butcher shop. (It's water buffalo, really, as cows remain largely sacred to the 
Hindus). 
</P>
<P>
Then, on to the vegetable stand, where the bugs are far smaller. Amoebas, 
mostly. You can't see them, but they're there. If you eat a salad that has not 
spent its day in a solution of iodine and potassium, the bugs suddenly appear 
-- in a form of dysentery curable only by medicine made from the same chemical 
used in industrial rat poison. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the water. Don't ask. Just don't drink it. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, on my first day in London, a friend suggested that I drop by the 
Food Hall in Harrods department store to see all of the First World treasures 
that I had been missing all these years. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as a mecca of capitalism, hedonism, epicureanism and sheer, obsessive 
decadance, Harrods stands alone. It's six stories of unabashed opulence and 
elegance on 4 1/2 of the most expensive acres of London real estate. 
</P>
<P>
It's owned by an Egyptian entrepreneur who has the kind of public relations 
department that sends out releases boasting, "All things, for all people 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
It was in the midst of all of this, in the heart and center of Harrods' endless 
ground floor, that I finally found the epic Food Hall. And indeed, it seemed 
light-years away from the diseased markets of Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
The specialty salad counter alone offered 34 varieties, and, beyond it, the 
mammoth grocery hall opened up before me like an edible universe. There were 
French peaches, Brazilian figs, Peruvian pomegranates, South African pomelos, 
American cherries, New Zealand kiwis, Costa Rican bananas, English strawberries 
and pineapples from Mauritius. And none of it had bugs, a rosy-cheeked Irish 
saleswoman assured me, through a look of some suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
But I saved the best for last. 
</P>
<P>
The Meat Hall. 
</P>
<P>
On one end of the cavernous room where vegetarians fear to tread, six giant 
sides of Scottish beef dangled from the ceiling like bait for the world's 
largest carnivore. The assortment under a clean glass counter was dazzling: 
minced beef, shoulder beef, brisket beef, rump steak, entrecote steak, Scotch 
filet steak . . . 
</P>
<P>
Then, suddenly, I realized that no one was actually buying any of it. In fact, 
in the midst of Harrods' famous summer sale, a time when the store is so jammed 
with humanity that the public relations department says each of its 50 
elevators may travel 100 miles in a single day, there wasn't a single customer 
anywhere near the meat counter. 
</P>
<P>
"I reckon it's the Mad Cow Disease and all, gov," the lonely butcher behind the 
counter said when I asked him why no one was buying his meat. 
</P>
<P>
"The what?" 
</P>
<P>
"Mad Cow, gov," he repeated. "Some kinda brain disease they say is killin' off 
our cows. 'Course our meat's fine enough, gov. Only the best here at Harrods. 
But, since the papers been fulla the Mad Cow scare, no one's buyin' beef no 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the newspapers reported the following day that Bovine Spongiform 
Encephalopathy, better known as Mad Cow Disease, had, indeed, killed tens of 
thousands of cows already. 
</P>
<P>
You can run, but you can't hide. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't drink the water," another English friend warned me the day after my Food 
Hall visit. 
</P>
<P>
"What water?" I asked, bewildered. 
</P>
<P>
"Our water. London tap water. Ever since the waterworks went private, it's full 
of diseases -- you know, cholera, typhoid and the lot." 
</P>
<P>
"I know cholera and typhoid. That's what we get when we drink the water in 
India," I replied. "But this is the First World. Surely, you don't have those 
diseases here anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, call 'em what you want. But don't drink the water." 
</P>
<P>
And sure enough, the following day I checked with the Royal Society, which 
confirmed that a large-scale investigation into the city's water quality was 
under way after the discovery of cryptosporidium, a lethal, water-borne 
bacterium, in the drinking water of several areas in or near London. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, you can run, but you can't hide. 
</P>
<P>
Many Londoners, when asked about the "Third Worldization" of a metropolis so 
genteel and urbane it has long been considered the capital of the First World, 
blame Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Others blame Britain's moribund bureaucracy and work ethic, or lack thereof -- 
problems that similarly plague the Indian nation that Britain helped build and 
govern during a century and a half of colonial rule. Still others blame 
England's immigration policies, which brought hundreds of thousands of new 
residents from its former, Third World colonies to this island nation. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, it was that same immigrant population that, more often than not, came 
to my rescue as I frantically tried to navigate through the surface culture 
shock and apparent time warp that lies between New Delhi and old London. 
</P>
<P>
It was, in fact, through that acclimatization process that I stumbled onto the 
most striking illustration of global shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
I was 200 feet beneath the city, and I was lost. It was my first attempt to 
negotiate the London Underground, the vast, snaking network of subway trains 
universally known as "the tube," which, when it's actually working, is the most 
pleasant and efficient urban mass transit system anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
On that particular day, though, it wasn't. Victoria Station was closed after a 
train ran someone over, and St. James Park Station was closed after a bomb 
scare. I attempted to circumnavigate the underground nightmare by taking an 
alternate train and ended up in a place I couldn't even pronounce. 
</P>
<P>
I went to the ticket booth, asked directions and, without hesitation, the 
helpful clerk pulled out maps, drew lines, circled stations and generally set 
me back on course. 
</P>
<P>
Grateful, I tried to strike up a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you from?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"From London, of course," he answered with a perfect British accent. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was born in India."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
THIS IS NO RACE TO BET ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There they go down the stretch! The cities of Santa Ana and Anaheim are 
involved in a race to be first with an indoor sports arena, and both are 
pulling out the stops. 
</P>
<P>
Did we say race? Some even call it war. An attorney for one developer said as 
much when he observed that, "the missiles are in the air and there's no calling 
the missiles back." 
</P>
<P>
Within the last month, both city councils waved through quick agreements that 
involved substantial commitments of public money, even though everyone in 
Orange County seems to agree that only one city can support an indoor arena. 
</P>
<P>
For all this enthusiasm, there are as yet no professional sports franchises to 
play in either stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But the speedy commitments of public money are what take one's breath away. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana's agreement one evening last week to loan King Guanci Development 
Inc. of Newport Beach $3.5 million annually for 30 years was rushed through 
quicker than you can say "indigestion." Council members arriving at a meeting 
on Tuesday were presented by the city staff with a memorandum of agreement that 
they had never before seen and yet were asked to sign. In fact, details of the 
agreement had been negotiated right up to the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
When Councilman Richards L. Norton made a reasonable request for time to study 
it, he was reminded that the race was on and that the developers needed to be 
able to show financial backers that they had their houses in order. And the 
city justified its haste by asserting that a detailed agreement would come 
later, with a fuller public review. 
</P>
<P>
To his credit, Norton voted against approval. In doing so, he became the only 
council member in either city to withhold support from concluding agreements. 
</P>
<P>
When the dust had settled, Santa Ana had committed itself to paying the 
developer up to $500,000 in preliminary planning expenses if project financing 
was not given final approval. That's not a bad deal for the developer, who was 
able to capitalize on a nervous city's eagerness to catch up with Anaheim, 
which already had concluded its stadium deal. 
</P>
<P>
But Anaheim, where nobody at all voted against the conclusion agreements with a 
New York developer, was willing to pay an even higher price: It could be liable 
for up to $2.5 million a year if there are operating shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim aims for a November ground breaking. Santa Ana is charging ahead. This 
is some race to the finish line.

TIME WARNER, STILL PAYING ON BUYOUT, LOSES $51 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time Warner Inc. reported Monday that it lost $51 million in the second quarter 
on revenue of $2.59 billion, but four of the company's six divisions posted 
increases in operating income. 
</P>
<P>
The media and entertainment giant, which is amortizing more than $10.6 billion 
in debt from Time's 1989 acquisition of Warner Communications, said operating 
income was $536 million for the period ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Steven J. Ross, chairman and co-chief executive, and Nicholas J. Nicholas, 
president and co-chief executive, said they were "pleased" by the divisions' 
strength. Operating income was defined as income before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortization. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported depreciation and amortization expenses of $268 million and 
interest expenses of $261 million for the second quarter. The net loss for the 
first six months came to $102 million on revenue of $5.33 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts said the quarterly report was generally in line with Wall 
Street's expectations. "They came in slightly on the better side of most 
people's estimates," said Jeffrey Logsdon, analyst with Seidler Amdec 
Securities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner's magazine division had lower operating income because of start-up 
costs associated with its Entertainment Weekly and the recession in the 
magazine industry. Operating earnings for the division were $85 million, 
compared to $99 million for the second quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But the company said advertising and circulation revenue increased "marginally" 
over last year. Edward Hatch, an analyst with Nomura Securities in New York, 
said start-up expenses associated with Entertainment Weekly and other projects 
totaled about $12 million in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Operating earnings from the filmed entertainment division were $75 million, 
compared to $61 million a year earlier. The company said Warner Home Video was 
a major contributor to those earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The music division's operating income rose to $125 million from $118 million, 
while the cable division's operating income was $188 million, up from last 
year's $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Time Warner Programming-Home Box Office division posted operating profit of 
$46 million, compared to $43 million last year. Expenses from the introduction 
of the Comedy Channel hurt those results. 
</P>
<P>
In the company's book division, operating income was $17 million, down from $38 
million last year. The decline was due primarily to Time Warner's sale of the 
Scott, Foresman educational publisher last December, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
For the other portions of the book division, operating earnings were roughly 
flat, officials said.

<P>
Oil giant Exxon Corp. said Monday that its second-quarter profit soared nearly 
seven-fold from a year ago, when it set aside a special provision to handle the 
massive cleanup from the oil spill in Valdez, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Another big oil company, Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., reported 
that earnings fell 16%, while independent producer Ashland Oil Co. said its 
earnings more than doubled in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Exxon earned $1.1 billion in the three months ended June 30, 
compared to $140 million in the 1989 quarter. Revenue totaled $26.08 billion, 
up 10% from $23.61 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's results included an $850-million provision for the Valdez spill. 
Without that, Exxon said, it would have earned $990 million in the 1989 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Arco's second-quarter earnings fell to $391 million from $467 million in 1989. 
Sales of the Los Angeles company fell 7% to $4 billion from $4.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Ashland, based in Ashland, Ky., reported record net income of $100 million for 
the quarter ended June 30, 1990. The amount was more than double the $44 
million in 1989. Sales were $2.2 billion, the same as in last year's quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Chairman L. G. Rawl said earnings from petroleum and natural gas 
operations increased $205 million, or 22%, despite lower crude prices. He said 
that helped offset a $115-million drop in chemical earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings from U.S. exploration and production activities were $81 million, down 
from $289 million in 1989. But earnings from foreign exploration and production 
operations rose $75 million to $464 million. 
</P>
<P>
From coal and minerals operations, Exxon earned $12 million, compared to $22 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1990, Exxon earned $2.38 billion, up 22% from $1.95 
billion in 1989. Revenue rose 15% to $52 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 results included an $880-million provision related to the Valdez 
accident and a $535-million cumulative accounting gain following adoption of 
new income tax accounting standards. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon said it would have earned $2.29 billion in the 1989 half year excluding 
the provision and special gain. 
</P>
<P>
Arco said lower crude oil prices, less production in Alaska and higher 
international exploration expenses more than offset a sharp rise in profits 
from refining and marketing operations.

T-Bill Rates Drop: The Treasury sold $9 billion of new three-month bills at an 
average discount rate of 7.49%, down from 7.62% last week. 
</P>
<P>
Another $9 billion of new six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate 
of 7.40%, down from 7.52% last week. The rates were the lowest since 
three-month bills sold for 7.37% on Oct. 16, 1989, and six-month bills averaged 
7.30% on Dec. 4, 1989. The new discount rates understate the actual return to 
investors -- 7.74% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for 
$9,810.70, and 7.79% for a six-month bill selling for $9,625.90. The discount 
rate reflects the price discount received when government securities are 
purchased at less than face value.

Chevron to Sell Mineral Assets: The San Francisco-based oil company said it 
would take a $30-million charge against second-quarter earnings to sell a 
number of mineral assets and restructure its Chevron Resources Co. subsidiary. 
In a "fundamental shift" in strategy, Chevron said it would sell all but three 
major non-coal minerals projects -- a platinum and palladium mine in Montana, a 
copper and silver property in Chile, and zinc and lead deposits in Ireland. 
Chevron Resources will oversee the sale of other minerals assets, which are 
expected to fetch more than $70 million before taxes and result in a net loss.

PEOPLE: ARCO SHUFFLES DUTIES OF TOP CANDIDATES FOR CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Atlantic Richfield Co. has juggled the jobs of three top executives to broaden 
each officer's experience, a move designed to ensure an orderly transition when 
one of them eventually succeeds Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, 62, who has held the top job at the Los Angeles-based oil company for 
five years, is expected to step down when he reaches age 65, Arco's retirement 
age for top officers. 
</P>
<P>
The job shuffle affected Cook's likeliest successors: executive vice presidents 
Ronald J. Arnault, 47; James A. Middleton, 54, and James S. Morrison, 60. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary goal in shifting responsibilities of a number of our senior 
managers is to provide broader experiences in order to appropriately prepare 
for the company's management succession needs," Cook said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Arnault, formerly chief financial officer, assumes responsibility for Arco's 
international oil and gas company, the unit in charge of exploration and 
production of oil and gas in the lower 48 states, and Arco's coal operation. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Arnault, the youngest of the three top executives, stands 
the best chance to take the chairmanship upon Cook's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Described as a quick-witted and visionary man of few words, Arnault was one of 
the executives who saw Arco through a successful financial restructuring in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But he has limited experience in the company's operational side -- considered 
crucial if he is to succeed Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Middleton, formerly president of Arco Oil &amp; Gas Co., the lower-48 unit, 
takes over Arco's three West Coast divisions: Arco Alaska Inc., which handles 
production from Arco's vast Alaskan fields; Arco Transportation Co., which 
moves that oil south, and Arco Products Co., which includes all Western 
refinery and marketing operations. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, who oversaw Arco's West Coast operations, becomes chief financial 
officer. He assumes control of the company's treasury, planning and control 
functions, government and public affairs and human resources departments. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison made a mark in the company in part by overseeing Arco's rise to the 
No. 1 retail position in the West Coast and its development of innovative 
products such as Arco's EC-1 lower emissions gasoline. Morrison's age -- he 
turns 61 in the fall -- makes him less likely to succeed Cook, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The credentials of all three are outstanding," said Eugene L. Nowak, senior 
energy analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Arnault and Middleton will report to Robert E. Wycoff, Arco's president and 
chief operating officer. Morrison will report to Cook. PATRICK LEE

RADIO STATION FINED FOR PAID 'INTERVIEWS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Radio station KMNY-AM, licensed out of Pomona and Anaheim, has been fined 
$10,000 by the Federal Communications Commission, in part for failing to 
disclose to listeners that stockbrokers and investment counselors interviewed 
on its financial programs had paid for their air time. 
</P>
<P>
In a notice to KMNY, which broadcasts at 1600 AM and bills itself as the 
nation's first all-business radio station, the FCC said the outlet: 
</P>
<P>
* Failed to disclose that Tom Reese of Reese Financial Group, Ron Johnson of 
Jack Carl 321 Futures and Dennis Hardaker of International Assets had paid for 
their appearances on interview-style programs in late 1989. 
</P>
<P>
* Left its transmitter unattended for several hours a day and had unlicensed 
operators at the transmission tower for at least two weeks in February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
* Without FCC approval, closed its main studio in Pomona for four months, 
starting in December, 1989, in order to operate out of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
* Failed to maintain a public inspection file or allow public access to its 
facilities for the same four months, until the FCC brought the matter to the 
station's attention. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC's "notice of apparent liability," a copy of which was obtained by The 
Times, was sent in the form of a letter to KMNY, dated July 16. KMNY has 30 
days to pay the fine or request a hearing to contest the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Edward (Buz) Schwartz -- president of Money Radio Inc., which operates the 
station, and founder of the National Investors Club of the Air, which owns 80% 
of it -- said Monday that he had not yet read the FCC's notice but added that 
he does not expect to contest the fine. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go to a lawyer, it will cost you $20,000, as opposed to $10,000 to pay 
the fine," said Schwartz, a former remote-control pager salesman who bought the 
station with money he raised after buying time on Glendale radio station KIEV 
in 1986 and 1987 to promote the purchase. "I'll read the letter, read what they 
say, and if it's grossly out of line, we'll contest it. Otherwise we'll pay." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Holberg, assistant chief of the FCC's complaints and investigations 
branch, said the agency has been watching Schwartz since his days on KIEV. In 
1988, the FCC fined KIEV owners Ron and Fred Beaton $10,000 for airing a 
program hosted by Schwartz called "The Investors Club of the Air," during which 
he allegedly interviewed subjects who had paid for their appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Holberg said KMNY featured guests who paid to be interviewed on two programs, 
"The Investors Club of the Air," hosted by Schwartz, and "Vera's Voice," hosted 
by his partner, Vera Gold. 
</P>
<P>
"Their appearance on the station was a result of the purchase of advertising," 
Holberg said. "They would buy advertising time if a person associated with 
(their company) could appear on an interview program. Or some of them would buy 
package arrangements, where they buy guest appearances as well as advertising." 
</P>
<P>
It's not illegal to sell the time, Holberg said, but the station must identify 
to listeners that the time has been sold. "Whether it's snake oil or 
securities, the same rule applies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC said its investigation of KMNY was prompted by a letter of complaint. 
The regulatory agency would not disclose the name of the whistle blower, but 
The Times has learned that it was a former employee. 
</P>
<P>
Since the FCC's initial inquiry, some of the violations have been remedied, 
according to Schwartz and Holberg. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the station was granted permission to operate out of Anaheim as 
long as it maintains a working telephone and staff in Pomona and allows 
residents access to its public files for licensing purposes. And the station 
has told the agency that the transmitter is now being operated by licensed 
engineers, according to Holberg.

CREDIT: BONDS DECLINE AS BUYERS FRET OVER ECONOMY

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a setback on Wall Street, bond prices sank Monday as worries about 
inflation and heavy government borrowing needs discouraged buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices soared briefly in morning trading when investors bailed out of the 
stock market and sought the safer haven of government securities. The surge 
came as an abrupt reversal for the bond market, which had opened weaker after 
U.S. government issues slid in earlier overseas trading. 
</P>
<P>
"When the stock market dropped like a lead balloon, our market rallied," said 
Elizabeth Reiners, a money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But the bond rally didn't last even though Wall Street failed to snap out of 
its slump completely. Off more than 100 points in the morning, the Dow Jones 
industrial index closed with a loss of 56.44 points, at 2,904.70. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond, the market's bellwether issue, finished off 7/32 
point, or nearly $2.50 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield rose to 8.55% from 
8.53% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary bond buying enthusiasm knocked interest rates down. Rates recede 
when bond prices go up. Long-term rates bobbed back up in the afternoon while 
interest on shorter term issues clung to some of their improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Bond market analysts said trading volume was heavy and activity was hectic at 
times. The short-lived rally was described as a "flight to quality," which 
often occurs when money pours into government bonds from a sliding stock 
market. Fixed-income investments are widely regarded as less risky than 
alternatives in the equity market. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation that interest rates will remain high and inflation might intensify 
aborted the rally, Reiners said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the government must raise an estimated $65 billion in cash in the 
current quarter and another $75 billion in the fourth quarter. This means the 
bond market will face a flood of new Treasury notes and bonds. The government 
will probably have to pay higher interest rates to attract buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Fear that inflation could creep higher in the months ahead also has bond 
investors on guard. One school of thought holds that inflation could accelerate 
if the Federal Reserve Board bows to political pressure and eases its monetary 
policy. Inflation is the archenemy of fixed income investments because it 
erodes their value. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 7.938%, down from 8% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Dips Sharply After Dow Tumbles 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's sharp drop helped push the dollar much lower against most other 
major currencies in foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the dollar started out softer amid continued worries 
about falling interest rates, but it declined more rapidly as traders around 
the world learned of the sharp drop in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Waves of computerized program selling, weak corporate earnings and concerns 
about broad economic factors were largely responsible for Wall Street's 
selloff. 
</P>
<P>
All that helped spook dollar traders, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a psychological thing," said Trevor Woodland, chief corporate 
trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. "If you're a trader you're not 
going to buy a currency when the equity market is faring poorly." 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true among foreign traders. As demand for equity falls, so 
does the need to convert foreign currencies into dollars to buy stocks. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar closed at 148.50 yen, 
up 0.15 yen from Friday's finish. The dollar traded lower at 148.40 yen in 
London, and at 148.19 yen in New York, down from 148.65 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was weaker against the British pound, compared to Friday. Sterling 
bought $1.8215 in London, up from $1.8140, and $1.8255 in New York, up from 
$1.8185. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Gold Prices Rise as Buyers Seek Haven 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices surged to their highest levels in two months as sharply 
lower stock prices, a weaker dollar and signs of Middle Eastern buying fired 
investor interest in the metal. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, silver also advanced, stock-index futures tumbled; 
energy futures climbed; livestock and meat futures retreated; and grains and 
soybeans were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $7.70 to $7.80 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, 
with the contract for delivery in August up $7.70 at $369.70 an ounce. The spot 
July contract settled at $369.10 an ounce, the highest settlement of a spot 
gold contract since May 22. 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures settled 3 cents to 3.4 cents higher, with July at $4.882 an 
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Gold opened with a surge in New York following news of a large purchase of gold 
bullion in London that analysts believe originated in the Middle East. Some 
previous Middle Eastern transactions have been large enough to swing prices 
wildly, leaving the market sensitive to signs of Middle Eastern interest. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the strong opening, the Dow index plunged, sending many stock 
investors fleeing to the perceived safety of the precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market slowly trimmed its losses throughout the day. But gold 
remained strong, with new support stemming from higher oil prices -- an 
inflationary signal -- and a weaker dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said the Federal 
Reserve Board's recent moves to lower interest rates have been a boon to the 
gold market. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like some foreigners are concerned about the possibility that (Fed 
Chairman Alan) Greenspan's stance toward inflation may be weakening, which 
pulled the props out from under the dollar," Savaiko said.

TRANSPORTATION TAX TO RETURN TO O.C. BALLOT 
</P>

<P>
Orange County voters, who have twice rejected proposals that would have created 
a local sales tax for transportation, will get a third chance to consider such 
a measure in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission voted Monday to place Measure M, a 
hotly contested half-cent sales tax initiative that failed last year, on the 
Nov. 6 ballot. The commission vote was 5 to 2, with Supervisors Roger R. 
Stanton and Harriett M. Wieder, who are also commission members, opposed 
because they believe too little time has passed since the measure's defeat last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that we're doing the right thing," said Commission Chairman 
Dana Reed. "As to whether the electorate approves, we'll just have to wait for 
the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision sets up a rematch of last November's special 
election, when Measure M failed by a margin of 53% to 47%. That election was 
marked by extraordinarily low turnout -- 22% of registered voters cast ballots. 
Backers of the transportation tax believe that the gubernatorial race this year 
will spur greater turnout, which might propel the proposal to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that a higher turnout could change the measure's prospects, in 
that it would be going before a broader spectrum of county voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the best shot they're ever going to have," said Harvey 
Englander, a Newport Beach political analyst. "With the right kind of campaign, 
I think they've got a good chance." 
</P>
<P>
Irv Pickler, vice chairman of the transportation commission, voted for putting 
the measure on the November ballot, saying that although it might entail a 
difficult campaign, higher turnout will help and time is not likely to soften 
the county's traditional opposition to new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish the timing was perfect," Pickler said, "but I don't think that two 
years hence it will be any better." 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls have suggested that a slim majority of county voters supports 
Measure M, but the margins have been perilously thin, and even supporters agree 
that without a vigorous campaign in its behalf, the tax could go down to defeat 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
That would mark the third time in six years county residents had rejected a 
transportation tax. The first was the 1-cent transportation tax that was 
resoundingly defeated in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't push this issue when I'm hearing voters say they don't want it," said 
Wieder, who is facing a November runoff in her bid to keep her supervisor's 
seat. "The voters have a right to decide, and I would never deny them that, but 
on the other hand, it looks like we're cramming it down their throats." 
</P>
<P>
The commission will repeat the vote for administrative reasons next week, and 
the measure is subject to review by the county supervisors, who are expected to 
take it up Aug. 7. Still, all parties agreed Monday that those two votes will 
be routine and that the measure will be on the ballot.

Reed and other backers of the sales tax proposal have long argued that the 
county needs the measure in order to smooth Orange County's snarled traffic. 
Without the sales tax, they note, the county will not be able to collect its 
full share of three recently passed statewide transportation measures. Those 
will provide hundreds of millions of dollars to local governments, but much of 
the money will go only to local jurisdictions that provide a matching share. 
</P>
<P>
All of Orange County's neighbors have transportation taxes in place, and local 
leaders fear that state and federal money that could go to Orange County will 
go to those places unless Orange County can pass a measure of its own. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal faces significant opposition, however: Detractors include those 
who oppose virtually any tax increase, environmentalists who complain that it 
does not go far enough toward regulating growth, and officials who support the 
tax but believe that this November is the wrong time to put it before the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I will maintain my position that it is a mistake for us to put this on the 
ballot," said Supervisor Stanton, who has often argued that it is too soon to 
bring the measure before the voters again. "I'm just going to sit back and 
watch." 
</P>
<P>
While Stanton and Wieder oppose Measure M's being on November's ballot, 
Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Don R. Roth strongly support it, and Riley has 
said he will campaign for it aggressively. Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez has not 
committed himself to a position on the issue.

N.Y. COMPANY TO BUY FORD AEROSPACE CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. confirmed Monday that it has selected Loral Corp., a New 
York-based defense electronics giant, as the winning bidder to purchase its 
Newport Beach-based defense subsidiary, Ford Aerospace Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price was not disclosed, but sources close to the negotiations 
said Loral will pay about $800 million in cash for Ford Aerospace and will 
assume certain other liabilities -- such as retiree benefit payments and other 
debt obligations -- which will boost the total value of Loral's offer to about 
$1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Not included in the deal, however, is Ford Aerospace's long-term lease on 99 
acres of ocean-view real estate in Newport Beach where it has its corporate 
offices and one of its largest manufacturing operations, the 2,700-employee 
Aeronutronic missile manufacturing division. The land is owned by the Irvine 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the transaction said Monday that the buyer of Ford Aerospace 
would be required to vacate the property within five years. 
</P>
<P>
A Ford executive who asked not to be identified confirmed that the lease was 
not included in the proposed sale to Loral. 
</P>
<P>
Loral, the nation's 19th-largest defense contractor, beat out two other teams 
of bidders, one that included El Segundo-based Hughes Aircraft Co. and another 
led by Westinghouse Electric Corp. in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
When Ford Motor put its defense subsidiary up for sale on Jan. 12, it had 
sought cash bids of $1.2 billion. But sources said no bidders were willing to 
offer that much because of the downturn in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
Loral and Ford Motor stressed that the agreement is not yet final and is 
subject to regulatory approvals. Ford Motor said a final deal is expected 
within three months. Loral said financing for the acquisition has been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Loral's offer was the best, financially, and meets all of our requirements," 
Harold A. Poling, Ford Motor chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. 
"The sale is for the whole of Ford Aerospace Corp. -- a fundamental objective 
for us throughout the sale process." 
</P>
<P>
However, some Wall Street analysts noted that Loral is only two-thirds the size 
of Ford Aerospace and may have to sell off certain operations to pay for the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, officials of a Westinghouse Electric-led consortium pledged not to 
dismantle the company if Ford Motor chose it as the winning bidder. The 
consortium also includes the Carlyle Group, a private merchant bank, and 
Aerospatiale, a French aerospace firm. The pledge was viewed as an effort by 
the Westinghouse group to gain an advantage in the bidding by suggesting that 
Loral was likely to break up Ford Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Beltramo, a Los Angeles defense consultant and former Rand Corp. 
analyst, said he doubts Loral is interested in all of Ford Aerospace's 
businesses. "I can't imagine why Loral would want to get into the missile 
business. They don't have anything in that area, and missiles is not a growth 
area. It's really been decimated in the past few years." 
</P>
<P>
He speculated that Loral may have been mostly interested in Ford Aerospace's 
satellite and space operations. 
</P>
<P>
". . . Maybe they saw a few interesting pieces (at Ford Aerospace) and thought 
they could get a dividend from the break-up value," Beltramo said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers speculated that if Loral does decide to sell part of Ford 
Aerospace, the most likely operations to be sold would be Ford's missile and 
satellite divisions in California and its BDM International Inc. subsidiary, a 
Virginia-based engineering and consulting company that Ford Aerospace bought 
for $425 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But Elizabeth Allen, a Loral spokeswoman, said the company intends to continue 
to operate Ford Aerospace as it currently exists. "We don't have any plans to 
break them up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the Aeronutronic division is clouded, ironically, by the rapid 
appreciation in the value of its real estate. Ford Aerospace's lease on 99 
prime, ocean-view acres runs through 2052, and the land could be worth up to 
$1.5 million an acre if developed with luxury housing. 
</P>
<P>
Ford pegged the value of the lease at $75 million, one source said, and expects 
to sell it back to the Irvine Co. Another source said the current plan was to 
sublet the land to Loral, but he could not provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of March, Loral reported that it had only $100 million in cash. 
Loral's contribution to the Ford Aerospace acquisition alone will be $150 
million. The New York investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. will 
contribute another $150 million, and the remaining $500 million will be 
financed through bank borrowings. 
</P>
<P>
In acquiring Ford Aerospace, Harris said, Loral would be fulfilling a 
long-stated goal of becoming a major manufacturer of weapons and communications 
systems, rather than only a supplier of components for such systems. 
</P>
<P>
In other defense acquisitions, Loral acquired Goodyear Aerospace for $588 
million in 1987, paid $58 million for Honeywell's electro-optics division in 
1989 and bought Fairchild Weston for $177 million, also last year. 
</P>
<P>
Loral's primary business is making electronic sensors for combat aircraft, 
which notify a a pilot when the aircraft has been targeted by enemy radar. The 
company also makes reconnaissance equipment, electronic countermeasure systems 
and missile guidance systems. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Loral will likely keep Ford Aerospace's electronic warfare, 
intelligence and command control operations. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Loral pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy charges in 
connection with the Pentagon's Ill Wind procurement fraud investigation. It 
paid $10.5 million in fines and related claims. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Martin, spokesman for Westinghouse in Baltimore, said Ford Motor notified 
the company that its bid for Ford Aerospace was turned down. The company had 
been teamed with the Carlyle Group investment firm and Aerospatiale of France. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely disappointed with the decision, but we will continue to watch 
the situation," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Ford Aerospace employees, Ford Motor said Loral's businesses 
complement the operations of Ford Aerospace. Ford Motor also said Loral has 
agreed to maintain for two years the current compensation and benefit programs 
now received by Ford employees, including medical and life insurance benefits 
for current and future retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence M. Harris, aerospace analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los 
Angeles, said "(Loral's management) has turned around acquisitions quickly and 
restored them to profitability. Ford Aerospace would be their biggest challenge 
to date." 
</P>
<P>
Loral will report its first-quarter results at its annual meeting today in New 
York. For its fiscal year ended March 31, the company reported earnings of 
$78.2 million on revenue of $1.27 billion, compared to earnings of $78.2 
million and revenue of $1.18 billion a year earlier. Its backlog of orders, as 
of March 31, was nearly $2.1 billion, contrasted with $1.3 billion a year 
earlier.

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER STADIUM PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Stadium Business Park, an 18-acre office and retail center, will be the 
latest addition to the growing business community around Anaheim Stadium if the 
City Council approves the project tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The project will include four high-rise office towers (two with 20 stories and 
two with 16 stories), a 400-room hotel, a health club, an eight-story parking 
structure and various restaurants and retail shops. 
</P>
<P>
Though the $500-million development deal is nearly complete, planners have not 
yet disclosed possible tenants for the project, said Steven Dietrich, a 
consultant for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium Business Park is planned for a rectangular plot across the street from 
the main entrance of Anaheim Stadium on State College Boulevard just south of 
Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Dietrich said developers were attracted to the area because of its freeway 
access, its proximity to the forthcoming Anaheim Arena and the expanding 
Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
If approved tonight, groundbreaking for the project is scheduled to begin in 
three to five years but could start sooner depending on the progress of the 
arena and other nearby projects, he said. LISA MASCARO

74% BACK TAX TO SAVE CANYON, POLL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly three-fourths of city voters support taxing themselves $150 a year to 
save Laguna Canyon from development, according to a poll released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by Sacramento-based political polling firm J. Moore 
Methods, surveyed 300 "high-propensity voters" in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The results, which have a margin of error of 6%, lend strong support for 
advocates of a November bond referendum intended to raise $20 million in the 
effort to buy and preserve the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Although only 57% of the respondents said early in the poll that they would 
favor a $20-million bond measure -- under which they would pay $150 a year in 
higher taxes -- after they heard arguments on both sides of the issue, 74% 
backed that option. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy about the results," said Mayor Lida Lenney. "I certainly hope 
that the council will go ahead with a $20-million bond issue." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Canyon property is valued at about $100 million, but Lenney and 
others have said they hope the city can raise funds from other sources and that 
the company will accept an initial sum of money as a "down payment." 
</P>
<P>
The council meets tonight and is scheduled to discuss the bond measure, which 
requires a two-thirds vote for approval. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the council can develop a plan for saving the canyon, the Irvine Co., 
which owns the land, intends to build homes on it. Irvine Co. executives are 
working with the city and other interested parties as part of the Laguna Laurel 
Advisory Group. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, company vice president Carol Hoffman said in a statement that the 
"company will continue to be supportive of efforts to develop a realistic plan 
to achieve acquisition of our property." JIM NEWTON

YEARLONG STUDY OF TRASH IS UNDER WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, the four men sifting through the trash appeared to be 
archeologists searching for discarded artifacts from past civilizations. 
However, at closer inspection, these artifacts smelled bad and were only about 
a week old. 
</P>
<P>
This month, the city of Fullerton, along with the Environmental Institute at 
Cal State Fullerton and MG Disposal Systems Inc., started a yearlong study to 
determine exactly what local residents throw away. 
</P>
<P>
The study is being done in compliance with a new state law that requires all 
cities and counties to reduce their solid waste and start recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
California cities are expected to reduce their waste flow 25% by 1995 and 50% 
by the year 2000, according to the law. Fullerton is the first Orange County 
city to undertake a trash survey as the first step in that process. 
</P>
<P>
The sorting was taking place in a corner of a warehouse at the MG Disposal 
facility in Fullerton. The four men were surrounded by at least 20 barrels of 
trash marked with identification tags. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to classify all the waste that's picked up by the special team 
of trash collectors to "get a feel for the trash," said Stewart L. Long, 
Environmental Institute director and Cal State Fullerton economics professor. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to know exactly what's being discarded by residents, business and 
industry," he said as buzzing flies played tag over his head. "The city wants a 
program that fits the community. We don't just want a curbside program that 
would only partially handle the waste flow." 
</P>
<P>
Overseeing the study is Black &amp; Veatch, a Santa Ana engineering firm hired 
by MG Disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Meyer, assistant to the city manager, said that the study will help 
Fullerton customize a recycling program to its own particular waste flow. 
</P>
<P>
"Several cities in the county have instituted recycling programs costing 
millions of dollars to implement. Many of these programs are based upon 
waste-stream assumptions that may or may not be accurate for Fullerton," Meyer 
said. "Our study will identify the sources and quantities of recyclable 
materials generated here and will enable us to tailor a recycling program to 
the actual recyclable waste stream produced by the city." 
</P>
<P>
The waste is sorted into eight categories: paper, plastics, glass, metals, yard 
waste, other organics, other waste and special waste. 
</P>
<P>
The study is utilizing trash picked up randomly from about 600 homes and 150 
businesses throughout the city. All sites are selected by a computer. 
</P>
<P>
After the study's completion, expected by May, 1991, the city will develop a 
recycling plan and submit it to the county for approval. 
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to cost the city about $215,000, said Meyer, noting that 
Fullerton will pay for the study through a one-year surcharge of 25 cents for 
residents and $2.10 for businesses on monthly trash rates. ERIK HAMILTON

MURDERER DENIED PAROLE FOR 5TH TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark J. Baker, serving life in prison for bludgeoning a friend to death on a 
Dana Point beach, was denied parole for the fifth time Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded decision, the three-member parole board cited the 
"especially atrocious and cruel" nature of the 1978 murder. 
</P>
<P>
They also noted Baker's long criminal record, earlier failures at probation, 
disciplinary problems in prison and failure to develop a marketable skill, said 
Phyllis Scott, spokeswoman for the California Board of Prison Terms. 
</P>
<P>
The board found that Baker "continues to be unpredictable and a threat to 
others," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was 21 when he was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole after 
pleading guilty to the murder of Karl Marcus Chancellor of Newport Beach. A 
year earlier, he had been acquitted of the murder of a Ft. Lauderdale doctor's 
wife -- a murder to which he had once offered to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Baker is now 33 and serving his sentence at the California Medical Facility in 
Vacaville. 
</P>
<P>
His parole has been vigorously opposed by his victim's parents and by the 
Orange County district attorney's office and Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
But one of Baker's former wives maintains that Baker has changed profoundly in 
prison and is no longer dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Baker will be granted another parole hearing in two years, Scott said. SONNI

POOL TIMING SYSTEM DONATED TO COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A private swim club has given Golden West College a new timing system for its 
Olympic-size pool. 
</P>
<P>
The community college announced that the private Golden West Swim Club had 
purchased the $3,000 system for the pool. 
</P>
<P>
It has been installed in time for use at the Long Course Junior Olympic 
Regional Competition, which begins Saturday at the college. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ken Hamdorf, swim and water polo coach at Golden West, praised the 
donation and said it is a valuable tool for all competitive swimming events. 
</P>
<P>
"The swimmer comes in and touches the electric pad, and this then goes to the 
computer, which records the exact time," Hamdorf said. "It eliminates a lot of 
people having to hand-time events, and it gets rid of a lot of headaches." 
</P>
<P>
Hamdorf said the electric pads are at the ends of swim lanes in the pool. The 
pads are covered with a rubberized fabric, and the timer is triggered by a 
touch from any part of the swimmer's body. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden West Swim Club comprises about 300 swimmers ranging in age from 4 to 
81.

TRUSTEES TO CHOOSE NAMES FOR 2 SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana Unified School District Board of Trustees will choose between 
suffragette Susan B. Anthony and legendary athlete Jim Thorpe tonight when they 
name one of two new elementary schools to be built to help house the district's 
growing student population. 
</P>
<P>
Two prominent names in Mexican history are being considered for the second 
school, with trustees to decide between former Mexican President Benito Juarez 
and Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor of California. 
</P>
<P>
After seeking public input in naming the proposed schools, a district committee 
sifted through a list of 30 suggestions before narrowing down the possibilities 
to four names. 
</P>
<P>
Permanent elementary schools in the district have traditionally been named 
after famous people, with an emphasis on former presidents. The names of living 
people normally aren't used, according to district officials.

MAYOR WILL REQUEST CHANGES TO CHARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fulfilling a campaign pledge, Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan tonight will try to 
start undoing a 1987 ballot measure that calls for the direct election of the 
city's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan, Irvine's second directly elected mayor, will ask City Council members 
to approve a City Charter amendment that would return the job of filling the 
largely symbolic position to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Her proposal also calls for the city election date to be moved from June of 
even-numbered years to November. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves Sheridan's request, the proposed charter amendment 
would go before Irvine voters this November. Electing a mayor creates the 
impression that the position carries a great amount of authority, Sheridan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting in the seat now, and the amount of perceived power that individual 
has in this system is awesome," she said. "I think it can be destructive to the 
city manager form of government." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, like most Orange County cities, is run on a day-to-day basis by a city 
manager hired by the council, which makes major policy decisions. Having a 
directly elected mayor creates an illusion that the mayor wields more power 
over the city than does a regular member of the council, Sheridan said. 
</P>
<P>
By returning selection of the mayor to the way it was before 1987, she said, 
the city also would solve problems created by Measure D. Voters approved 
Measure D in 1988 to spell out an alternate process of replacing a council 
member who runs for mayor and wins, leaving an unexpired seat on the council. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit and legal wrangling over how to interpret Measure D have cost the 
city $163,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a fiasco," Sheridan said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 law said the council opening would be filled by the runner-up in the 
City Council race. But Measure D added a proviso that if residents could gather 
signatures from 7% of the city's registered voters, the position would be 
filled through a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan's proposed charter amendment would delete Measure D. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the charter changes would begin with the November, 1992, election, 
leaving Sheridan as mayor for the next two years. Two council seats set to 
expire in July, 1992, would have their terms lengthened five months because of 
the change in the election date. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Agran, whom Sheridan defeated for the mayoral post last month, supported 
the measure to have an elected mayor. He said that it would eliminate the 
back-room politicking among council members and that it would make the mayor 
more accountable to voters. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Sheridan said, Agran used the seat to try to wield more power over 
city administrators.TOM McQUEENEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
1ST REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT OPENS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city today shows off its first major downtown redevelopment project: a new 
high-rise hotel facing the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-story, $55-million Waterfront Hilton opens to the public this morning, 
although formal dedication is not scheduled until Sept. 13, said Steve Bone, 
president of Waterfront Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is on Pacific Coast Highway at Huntington Street, four blocks south 
of the city's pier. 
</P>
<P>
The Waterfront Hilton is the first of four hotels scheduled to be built in the 
area between Huntington Street and Beach Boulevard. The hotel complex is part 
of Huntington Beach's multimillion-dollar plans to redevelop its decayed 
downtown. A new commercial complex, called Pierside Pavilion, at Main Street 
and Pacific Coast Highway, is scheduled to officially open in September. 
Pierside Pavilion will have an assortment of movie theaters and restaurants to 
complement the new hotels four blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Bone said all 300 rooms in the Hilton have ocean views. Room prices range from 
$165 to $275 a night, but suites on the upper floors will rent for as much as 
$1,200 a night.

NEIGHBOR REVIVES GIRL, 1, AFTER SHE NEARLY DROWNS IN BATHTUB

<P>
A 1-year-old girl was in stable condition Monday afternoon after she was found 
in a bathtub and revived by a neighbor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said Iris Cuevas was the ninth infant near-drowning victim 
brought to Children's Hospital of Orange County this month and the fourth 
within a week. 
</P>
<P>
The infant's mother, Maria Ramirez, told police that she left Iris alone in the 
bathtub for less than a minute and returned to find her in the bathwater not 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
"She grabbed the child and ran outside of her apartment screaming and crying, 
'My baby is dying,' " County Fire Capt. Dan Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hahn, a resident of the apartment complex on the 17000 block of Kenyon 
Drive, heard Ramirez calling and took the infant in his arms and started 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'Tilt the head back, pinch off the nose,' and started 
getting some air into her lungs," Hahn said. "I just focused on the kid." 
</P>
<P>
After about nine puffs of air, Hahn said he could hear Iris' labored breathing. 
Paramedics arrived and gave Iris oxygen. Soon after, Iris started to cry. 
</P>
<P>
"That was quite a relief. . . . The paramedics said that was the best sign," 
Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hahn) seems to have made all the difference in the infant surviving," Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Iris was taken to Healthcare Medical Center in Tustin and later transferred to 
Children's Hospital for observation, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"These near-drownings are a very common problem," Young said. "When it comes to 
infants, you can't turn your back on them for a minute. . . . A minute is a 
long time for an infant not to be breathing. People need to take that extra 
moment to put their child in a safe location."

NAVY PLAN FOR PORT ADDITION CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Salvos of criticism from environmental and peace activists as well as local 
residents bombarded the Navy's proposal to build a $200-million addition to its 
port facilities at the U.S. Naval Weapons Station in Seal Beach before and 
during the project's unveiling at a City Council meeting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
But far from abandoning the proposal, Navy officials remained confident that 
community members would see benefits in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The station will continue to be a very quiet neighbor," Capt. Stephen T. Holl, 
commanding officer of the weapons station, told the council, adding that he 
welcomed citizen involvement in an environmental impact study that will likely 
begin within two months. 
</P>
<P>
Before the council meeting, representatives of Green Peace and the Peace 
Network passed out leaflets discussing concerns about naval accidents in the 
past to council members. 
</P>
<P>
"We're against this; we're going to fight it tooth and nail," said David 
Skelly, associate environmental director for the Surfrider Foundation, a 
Huntington Beach-based environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also raised concerns about potential adverse environmental 
effects of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings, who represents the Surfside area, said the 
project would "impact residential neighborhoods tremendously" and cited 
concerns about possible fuel spills from ships that would be closer to shore if 
the project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is still awaiting Pentagon and congressional approval. The city 
has no authority to approve or deny the project. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's plan would, by 1997, reshape the entrance to Anaheim Bay. The 
man-made bay is used by the Navy to load and unload ammunition at the weapons 
station and by private boats to enter and exit Huntington Harbour. 
</P>
<P>
A 4,000-foot extension to the bay's east jetty would allow large warships to 
unload ammunition directly onto a new wharf. Currently, Navy craft too large to 
enter Anaheim Bay must anchor several miles away and wait for barges to carry 
their ammunition to and from the base. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has drawn criticism from environmentalists and homeowners who fear 
that it would turn a natural beach into something more like an artificial bay, 
shifting beach sand into new, unpredictable patterns, eliminating the offshore 
surf and ruining views. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy defended the project, which it hopes to begin by 1993, saying that it 
would improve boater safety in the bay, slow down beach erosion in the Sunset 
Beach and Surfside areas and give the beaches a one-time "sand dividend" by 
using dredged-up sand to build up the shoreline.

David Arnold Brown: 
</P>
<P>
Masterminded a twisted plot to have his 14-year-old daughter, Cinnamon, kill 
his wife, Linda Marie, collect $835,000 in life insurance on his wife and then 
marry the dead woman's 17-year-old sister, Patti. When the plot was unraveled 
and Brown arrested, he hired a fellow inmate to kill the three people he felt 
responsible for his predicament.Linda Marie Brown: 
</P>
<P>
As David Brown's fourth wife, the 24-year-old was the target of the 1985 
murder/insurance fraud scheme plotted by him, her sister, and stepdaughter 
Cinnamon Brown. Cinnamon Brown: 
</P>
<P>
Since her father "didn't have the stomach for it," Cinnamon carried out the 
murder of Linda Marie. Hours after fatally shooting her stepmother twice in the 
abdomen, Cinnamon, then 14, was found nearly comatose, lying in her own vomit 
in a back-yard doghouse, clutching a suicide note that read, "Dear God, please 
forgive me. I didn't mean to hurt her." She confessed to the murder and was 
sentenced to 27 years to life but remained silently loyal to her father for 
three years until she was persuaded in 1988 to reveal the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
Patti Bailey: 
</P>
<P>
The younger sister of Linda Marie, she lived with the couple, and she and Brown 
had sex from the time she was 11. Originally designated to kill her sister, she 
backed out at the last minute. A little more than a year after the murder, she 
secretly married her dead sister's husband. She and Brown have a 2-year-old 
daughter who is living with a Bailey family member. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Newell: District attorney investigator responsible for persuading Cinnamon 
to reveal her father's murder plot. Because of his persistence, Newell himself 
became a target in Brown's murder-for-hire scheme. The others were his wife 
Patti and prosecuting attorney Jeoffrey L. S. Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Steinhart: Picked up on a parole violation from an earlier cocaine 
conviction, he met Brown while in Orange County jail. The two quickly hit it 
off, and Steinhart agreed to murder Jay Newell, Patti Bailey and Jeoffrey 
Robinson for at least $21,700. 
</P>
<P>
Jeoffrey L.S. Robinson:

HENDERSON'S HOMER IN 10TH BEATS ANGELS; 
</P>

BASEBALL: OAKLAND, TRAILING 6-0 IN THE FIFTH INNING, COMES BACK TO RECORD A 7-6 
VICTORY AND DROP CALIFORNIA 13 1/2 GAMES BACK.

<P>
The Angels' vital signs flickered perceptibly Monday night when Rickey 
Henderson's home run with one out in the 10th inning capped a dramatic comeback 
and gave the Oakland A's a 7-6 victory over the Angels at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener of a stretch Manager Doug Rader had termed "vitally important" to 
his club's pennant hopes, the Angels built a 6-0 lead through 5 1/2 innings, 
only to see it evaporate when their relief pitchers proved unable to stop the 
late-charging A's. 
</P>
<P>
A single by Mark McGwire and sacrifice fly by Troy Afenir closed the gap to 6-5 
before Felix Jose tied it with a single to left with one out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson slammed the game-winner off Cliff Young (0-1), the fourth 
Angel pitcher, to improve Oakland's record against the Angels this season to 
3-0 and stretch the A's lead over the Angels to 13 1/3 games. Oakland 
maintained a three-game lead over the second-place Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat was the Angels' first in a game they had led after seven innings. 
They were 41-0 in previous games in which they were ahead that late. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Kirk McCaskill yielded only one run in six innings but tired in 
the sixth. Mike Fetters, Mark Eichhorn and Young were not up to the task of 
preserving the lead. 
</P>
<P>
An unearned run gave the Angels a jump in the first. Johnny Ray doubled into 
the right-field corner and took third when Dave Stewart's first pitch to Max 
Venable skipped past catcher Ron Hassey for a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
Venable walked, but Dave Winfield scored Ray with a single to right. Lee 
Stevens had a chance to create havoc but grounded into a double play, leaving 
him 0 for 12 since his first-inning home run Friday against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Station-to-station baseball produced another run for the Angels in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Parrish led off with a single to right, extending his hitting streak to 
seven games. He went to second on Brian Downing's single to left and advanced 
to third when Jack Howell walked. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish scored on Donnie Hill's fly to medium left, brushing past Hassey 
following a one-bounce throw from left fielder Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Singles in the fourth by Downing, Howell and Luis Polonia -- the last with two 
out -- increased the Angels' lead to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
They continued to hit Stewart hard, adding two more runs in the fifth to pad 
their lead to 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Venable opened the inning by beating out a chopper for an infield hit. He went 
to third on Winfield's single to left but injured his shoulder or head while 
sliding past third baseman Jamie Quirk. 
</P>
<P>
He was fine after receiving attention from trainer Ned Bergert and got the 
chance to rest on the bench after he was thrown out trying to score on 
Parrish's grounder to short. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield, who had moved to second on a passed ball, took third on Parrish's 
grounder. Winfield and Parrish scored when Downing lined a double to 
left-center for his third hit in three at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Klink relieved Stewart before the sixth and ran into trouble when he 
fumbled Polonia's chopper to the first-base side of the mound for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia stole second and took third on Hassey's high throw, which sailed into 
center field. Polonia scored on Venable's single to right. 
</P>
<P>
Hassey made some compensation for his error and two passed balls in the sixth 
when he ended McCaskill's shutout bid. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco, hitless in two previous at-bats, led off with a walk and moved to 
second on McGwire's groundout. Hassey then lined a single to right. Winfield's 
throw reached Parrish on one bounce but Parrish could not hold onto it, and 
Canseco was safe. 
</P>
<P>
With McCaskill showing signs of weariness in the sixth in the form of two 
walks, Mike Fetters was brought in for the seventh. He gave up a one-out single 
to Rickey Henderson, who was forced at second by Dave Henderson, and was a 
spectator when Jose Canseco crushed a one-and-0 pitch well over the 375-foot 
sign in left-center. 
</P>
<P>
The home run was Canseco's 29th of the season and seventh in 13 games since the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel television announcer Joe Torre expects the St. Louis Cardinals to decide 
within a week whether they want him to be their next manager. Torre was 
interviewed by General Manager Dal Maxvill last Wednesday, but Hal Lanier and 
Don Baylor have also been interviewed. Lanier and Torre are considered the top 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I wasn't sure (if he was interested), but the more I started thinking 
about who I'd be working with, it gets you a little excited," said Torre, who 
lost out on jobs with Minnesota, Pittsburgh, the Chicago Cubs and Houston after 
his 1984 dismissal as manager of the Atlanta Braves. "I always find my way back 
there, for Old Timers' games or whatever . . . I'm lucky. The situation here 
makes it that much tougher if they want me." 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dick Schofield was scratched from the lineup minutes before game time 
because of soreness in his right shoulder, the result of his dive for ball 
Sunday. Reliever Bryan Harvey was unavailable Sunday and Monday because of a 
strained muscle which left him with a stiff neck. His status is day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the distance between the top teams in the AL West and the rest of the 
pack, A's Manager Tony La Russa says the division is "probably more than a 
two-team race. There's plenty of time for clubs to play their way into it." 
Outfielder Luis Polonia said a sweep in Oakland was imperative if the Angels 
are to be among them. 
</P>
<P>
"This series means the whole thing for us," Polonia said. "If we don't beat 
these guys right here, there's no more chance for us. There's no more time. 
We've got to go out and do it." 
</P>
<P>
A re-examination of infielder Mark McLemore's sore right thumb and wrist found 
no new damage. He will continue therapy. . . . Bob McClure (sore left elbow) 
will pitch a simulated game Friday. If all goes well, he will go out on 
rehabilitation assignment.

Ford Motor Co.'s announcement Monday that it has agreed to sell its Ford 
Aerospace subsidiary to Loral Corp. did little to clarify the future for the 
2,700 employees at the firm's Aeronutronic defense plant here, in part because 
the lease on the plant's property is not included in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some analysts said Loral, a New York-based defense electronics 
company, is likely to sell off portions of Ford Aerospace that do not 
complement its own operations. For example, the Newport Beach division 
manufactures the venerable Sidewinder and Chaparral missiles, but missiles do 
not fit with Loral's existing operations, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Ford Aerospace employees leaving the Newport Beach plant Monday afternoon 
said they had not received enough information to know how the sale will affect 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know enough to say much," said Norman Potter, a materials scientist 
who held a blue paper handout announcing the sale to employees. "Nobody knows 
much about (Loral)." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's Aeronutronic division occupies 99 prime, ocean-view acres that the 
company leases from the Irvine Co. under a contract that expires in 2052. 
Sources said Monday that the lease was not included in the sale and that the 
buyer of Ford Aerospace would be required to vacate the property within five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A Loral spokeswoman said there were no current plans to sell pieces of Ford 
Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
But Loral will assume a large debt burden with its acquisition, and some Wall 
Street analysts expect the company to sell some operations, possibly including 
the Virginia-based consultant BDM International Inc., a satellite manufacturing 
operation in Silicon Valley and themissile group in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Beltramo, a Los Angeles defense consultant, speculated that Hughes 
Aircraft Co., which submitted a losing bid for Ford Aerospace in conjunction 
with Alcatel of France, may be interested in buying the missile business. A 
Hughes spokesman declined to comment on that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Ford purchased the Aeronutronic business in 1956 and moved the operation to 
Newport Beach in 1960. The division grew rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s on the 
strength of the Sidewinder air-to-air missile and Chaparral surface-to-air 
missile programs. In the 1970s, the Pave Tack bomb-targeting system also became 
a significant source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The division was highly profitable in the 1970s and early 1980s, former 
executives have said, and employment at one point reached 3,500. But these 
officials say Ford failed to invest adequately in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Aeronutronic suffered a major blow in 1985 when the Pentagon canceled the 
problem-plagued Sgt. York tank-mounted gun program after an investment of $1.8 
billion. That resulted in 1,300 layoffs at the Newport Beach plant. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the Aeronutronic unit has struggled with production problems and 
a decline in orders for its mainstay missile products. Sources have said the 
division is not currently profitable. Still, the firm did receive a lift 
earlier this year when it received orders for a potentially lucrative 
missile-guidance system, and the company's electro-optics technology is highly 
regarded in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the Aeronutronic unit to another company would not guarantee the 
operation's move from Newport Beach, but a large defense firm might choose to 
relocate production to its own facilities elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
And that possibility worries Richard Luehrs, president of the Newport Harbor 
Area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the economic impact," Luehrs said. "We don't know what 
the intent of the buyer might be. It doesn't matter who owns it; the question 
is whether or not it remains an employment center."

Southland Communications Inc. has filed a $10-million countersuit against its 
largest creditor, Motorola Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola sued Southland in May, charging that Southland was delinquent in 
payments for paging equipment it purchased from Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
That lawsuit asked for $5.6 million 
</P>
<P>
Southland's suit, filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, 
denies most of the charges in the Motorola suit. 
</P>
<P>
In its countersuit, Southland accuses Motorola of agreeing to sell pagers to 
Southland even though Motorola knew that the small paging company, with 50,000 
subscribers, would not be profitable and able to repay Motorola until it had 
100,000 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola said in its suit that Ahmad Bayaa and Ziad N. Bayaa, chief financial 
officer of Southland, both personally guaranteed Southland's debt. But Bayaa 
said in the countersuit that he revoked the personal guaranty in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Griffith, an attorney for Motorola, declined to comment. In April, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission sued Southland's president, Ahmad N. Bayaa, 
and five other defendants for allegedly conspiring to manipulate Southland's 
stock price, which soared 83% in value in late March and early April. The 
company's offices have also been searched in connection with a criminal 
investigation by the U.S. attorney's office.

BECKMAN RESULTS SHOW 25% DECLINE; 
</P>
<P>
EARNINGS: THE COMPANY ATTRIBUTED A POOR SECOND QUARTER TO INCREASED SPENDING 
FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND A DROP IN FEDERAL RESEARCH GRANTS.

<P>
Reflecting increased spending for new product development and a decline in 
federal grants for medical research, Beckman Instruments' second-quarter 
earnings fell 25%, to $8.6 million from $11.4 million a year earlier, the 
company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton-based manufacturer of medical diagnostic and life science 
research instruments has struggled with declining sales and earnings since 
SmithKline Beckman Corp. spun off the unitas an independent public company in 
July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for the second quarter ended June 30 rose 1% to $202.9 million, from 
$200.5 million in the year-earlier period. Company executives said the sales 
gain, though small, is a sign that the company may be emerging from its 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the worst is over," said Louis T. Rosso, Beckman's chief executive. 
He noted that federal budget proposals call for increased spending for medical 
research next year, which would translate into new orders for the equipment 
that Beckman makes and sells. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect there will be an explosive bounce-back of public funding," 
Rosso said. "It just will be better." 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of the year, Beckman's earnings were $16.6 million, 
down from $22.1 million for the same period of 1989. Sales declined from $399.5 
million to $388.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Not only have sales of scientific laboratory instruments suffered, but 
Beckman's sales of diagnostic instruments have been hit by a trend among 
financially strapped hospitals to lease costly medical equipment rather than 
buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Steffenhagen, Beckman's investor relations manager, said that while lease 
contracts are profitable and generate revenue over a number of years, they have 
a short-term depressive effect on earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the second-quarter decline in profits was due primarily to 
"strategic investment in new products," noting that the company's funding for 
research and development in that quarter was $20.8 million, or 21% greater than 
in the same period of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Rosso said the company is cutting back on investments in other business areas, 
such as marketing and administration, to bolster spending on research in order 
to develop products for the fast-developing biotechnology market. "We believe 
the explosion in biological sciences augurs very well for this business over 
the long term," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosso also said that while domestic sales of equipment for the life sciences 
market have been slumping, international sales of the same gear are on the 
upswing. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, closed Monday at $16.75 a 
share, down 50 cents from Friday's close. 
</P>

BECKMAN INSTRUMENTS' PERFORMANCE 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter ended June 30, Beckman Instruments Inc. reported earnings 
of $8.6 million, down 25% from $11.4 million. The company attributed the 
declining profits to its increased spending on research and development and 
reduced demand. Figures in millions, except per share

LOCAL ARCHITECTS HONOR SCHOOL DESIGNS, 'ON-THE-BOARDS' PROJECTS

The Orange County chapter of the American Institute of Architects has honored 
projects conceived by local architects that are still "on the boards" -- 
designs that are not yet built. Of the eight awards (in "honor," "merit" and 
"honorable mention" categories) bestowed at AIA's meeting Friday, three were 
for educational buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Irvine Science Library -- designed by James Stirling, Michael Willford 
&amp; Associates of London and the IBI Group of Newport Beach -- won an honor 
award. Lawrence W. Speck, professor of architecture at the University of Texas 
at Austin and spokesman for the four-member jury, called the circular edifice 
with massive vertical wings "a monumental building of great presence" and 
further praised its "beautifully functioning" interior with private study. He 
said jury members were "a little concerned," however, about the folded glass on 
the facade. 
</P>
<P>
Speck added that the jury was "surprised" to learn that the library was 
designed in association with Stirling, the eminent British architect: "We just 
liked it because we liked it." Working drawings are being completed for the 
project, and bidding on the construction is scheduled in October. 
</P>
<P>
New Elementary School, Wood Ranch Site in the Simi Valley, by the Blurock 
Partnership of Newport Beach, also won an honor award. "No one deserves good 
architecture better than little kids," Speck said, singling out the project's 
"strong, clear concept" and "well-developed plan" in which diverse elements are 
unified "under a simple, broad roof." Construction is expected to begin next 
spring, pending design approval by the school board. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman Hills Elementary School in Orange, designed by Dougherty &amp; 
Dougherty of Newport Beach, won a merit award. Speck said the organization of 
the plan -- small groups of classrooms under an expansive roof -- gives the 
building the feeling of a big, community-embracing "house." Construction has 
begun, and the project is scheduled to be completed in February. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Mark H. Singer &amp; Associates of Laguna Beach, the Singer 
Residence -- the architect's own house in Laguna Beach -- won an honor award 
for "very experimental, personal expression" and the "sensual quality of space 
and materials." The concrete walls were inspired by the materials of the house 
in which Singer's wife, Myriam, lived in her native Peru. The house is under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Another award of merit was given to Valley Telecommunications Headquarters in 
Van Nuys, designed by Leason Pomeroy Associates of Irvine, for "the ability to 
make a vernacular industrial remnant into a very sophisticated and humanized 
environment" in which even the tower serves as a visual symbol for 
telecommunications. Groundbreaking is scheduled for January. 
</P>
<P>
Honorable mentions went to Mark A. Keller &amp; Associates of Huntington Beach 
for a budget-minded solution to low-income housing on a multi-use site -- the 
Rugby Senior Apartments in Huntington Park -- and to Wimberly Allison Tong 
&amp; Goo of Newport Beach for a renovation scheme for the Ritz-Carlton 
Huntington in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The "People's Choice" award -- voted by passers-by who saw renderings of the 85 
entries in South Coast Plaza's Jewel Court last week -- went to St. Paul's 
Greek Orthodox Church, designed by Grillias Pirc Rosier Alves of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
During introductory remarks, Speck noted dryly that the jury had been 
"intrigued by the 'Mission-ization' of Orange County. We saw more red-tile 
roofs . . . " The audience of 500 architects and guests roared with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum's recent decision to fire internationally 
renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano, and to replace him with Kohn Pedersen 
Fox &amp; Associates of New York, didn't pass without comment. 
</P>
<P>
"They've traded Ingmar Bergman for Steven Spielberg," lamented one local 
architect, even though he said he had serious reservations about the 
effectiveness of Piano's design because of its heavy dependence on 
state-of-the-art technology. 
</P>
<P>
Another architect expressed surprise at his colleague's quip: "Spielberg? Oh, I 
would have said someone with a lot less artistry than that." 
</P>
<P>
The jury also included James A. Murphy, profession and industry editor of 
Progressive Architecture magazine; William Turnbull Jr., director of William 
Turnbull &amp; Associates in San Francisco; and Peter Walker of Peter Walker 
Associates, a San Francisco landscape architecture firm.

Architecture winner -- Engineering Unit 2, designed for the UC Irvine campus by 
Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership of Newport Beach, was inadvertently omitted 
from Tuesday's list of awards given by the Orange County chapter of the 
American Institute of Architects. The project, on which construction is 
expected to start in fall of 1991, received a Merit award. Juror Lawrence Speck 
cited the "responsiveness" of the design to the two adjacent buildings designed 
by Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry and to the "not-always-successful" master 
plan of the campus. Speck also noted the "monumentality" of the entryway and 
the architects' tip of the hat to Beaux Arts-style planning in the focus and 
axis of the building.

SENEGALESE SENSATION N'DOUR RIVETS AUDIENCE WITH RHYTHMS

Oat bran and fish oil may be good for us, but leave it to the cigarette and 
beer companies to sponsor a great concert. For whatever motives, the products 
that require warning labels seem to have the monopoly on subsidizing (or, in 
the case of beer, suds-idizing) engaging, unique music. 
</P>
<P>
Featuring Senegalese sensation Youssou N'Dour and Samite of Uganda, the debut 
offering Sunday evening of the Parliament Sound Series free performances at 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre offered some of the most engaging, inspiring and 
dance-compelling world music ever to touch down in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
It's a carbuncled footnote that even cigarette companies seem to be hipper than 
Orange County. The attendance for the show was low, filling only a few thousand 
seats in the orchestra section. It's a daring thing the Parliament people did 
in opening their series (which also features such domestic staples as Starship 
and Taylor Dayne) with an African performer such as N'Dour -- but not all that 
daring. 
</P>
<P>
N'Dour is hardly unknown, having recorded and toured with Peter Gabriel and 
performed for hundreds of thousands on the Amnesty International "Human Rights 
Now!" tour and England's globally broadcast Nelson Mandela concert in 1989. 
He's a major concert draw in many parts of the world, and his two East Coast 
dates for Parliament reportedly were packed. 
</P>
<P>
While a sea of empty seats typically dampens audience response, few in the 
crowd had occasion to consider the daunting emptiness behind them. Instead, 
most were up dancing, their eyes riveted on N'Dour, who is indeed a most 
riveting performer. Falling just shy of two hours, his performance was a 
stunning blend of traditional Senegalese music and Western funk, soul, Latin 
and rock influences. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old N'Dour comes from a line of griots, singer-storytellers who 
impart tradition and morals in many African cultures. Though the literal import 
of most of his songs was lost in the language barrier -- he chiefly sang in his 
native Wolof -- there was an unmistakable, and irresistible, passion in his 
plaintive high tenor voice. 
</P>
<P>
N'Dour's dancing and stagecraft displayed a surety and command -- including 
touches of Gabriel's studied theatricality -- mixed with a playful 
free-floating ease. He and his 10-piece band performed with a joyous precision, 
rather like what one expects James Brown's band would have sounded like had it 
been based on brotherhood instead of James' system of fines for errant 
instrumentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the show's 15 songs were drawn from N'Dour's forthcoming "Set" album, 
due out Sept. 10 on Virgin, and they show a fine progression in the artist. The 
traditional Senegalese elements are more central to the songs, with the 
European and American influences more integrated and used to better effect. The 
finest of these Sunday was "Miyoko," a slinky, beguiling mesh of polyrhythms 
that unexpectedly romped into stunning choruses that employed the greatest 
dance party riff Motown never thought of. 
</P>
<P>
The flamenco-flavored guitar work on "Alboury" suggested that N'Dour may have 
been listening to the Gipsy Kings lately, and his quarter-toned vocals 
highlighted the Muslim influence that runs through both cultures. 
</P>
<P>
He offered a fascinating version of his "Nelson Mandela" at the center of his 
performance. While featuring a jaunty rhythm (punctuated by talking drum master 
Assane Thiam) and celebratory sing-along that reflected how much Mr. Mandela's 
situation has improved since the song was penned, N'Dour also sent long, 
haunting falsetto notes flying over the song, perhaps a commentary on how far 
the struggle in South Africa has yet to go. 
</P>
<P>
Seats had been removed from the orchestra pit area immediately in front of the 
Meadows' stage to allow dancing, an idea whose splendidness can't be 
overstated. Having that dance area near the performers seemed to enliven both 
the audience and N'Dour. On future scaled-down shows of a similarly rhythmic 
bent, the Meadows might do well to adopt this dance floor-general seating 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
Show opener Samite of Uganda offered a set that was at once more exotic -- 
performing exclusively traditional African music on traditional acoustic 
instruments -- and more easily bridged, by way of Samite's warm, humorous 
English-language introductions. 
</P>
<P>
Prefacing one song, he described a tribe gently ridiculing missionaries' 
attempts to teach English to their chief: "The chief speaks this new language," 
he related, "Really? What does he say?" "A-E-I-O-U." 
</P>
<P>
Backed by two percussionists, Samite performed on kalimba (African thumb 
pianos), flutes and marimba. Though one of his kalimbas was no larger than two 
cigarette packs, when amplified it revealed an enfolding timbre and 
interweaving complexity that Philip Glass would be hard pressed to replicate. 
Another repeating melody moved "Waterfall," a beautifully lilting tune played 
on the litungu, a banjo-toned Kenyan lyre. His eight-number performance earned 
two standing ovations.

CLASSICAL SUCCESS IN THE KEY OF SIMPLICITY

Pianist James Barbagallo and tenor Alan Bowers proved over the weekend that 
simplicity can be the surest way to success. In a shared recital before a small 
audience in Salmon Recital Hall on Friday night, the two opened the third 
annual Summer Seminar for pianists and singers at Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
Barbagallo, in particular, brought a straightforward and often understated 
approach to his performance. In Mozart's Sonata in B-flat Major, K. 570, the 
pianist employed a clear delicacy to create an amiable atmosphere. As part of 
his effort to maintain a good-natured ambience, Barbagallo tamed details -- 
such as the marcato markings in the third-movement Allegretto -- that might 
have obstructed his goals. The Adagio emerged as a quiet, intimate song. 
</P>
<P>
Barbagallo offered two subtly shaded nocturnes by Chopin, Op. 62, No. 2 and Op. 
9, No. 3, as the closing pieces of the program. Here, he used a tastefully 
refined rubato and, though he glossed over some of the more telling dissonances 
in the earlier opus, he achieved an attractive cantabile. 
</P>
<P>
The final work in the set, Chopin's 1st Scherzo, contrasted a fiery facility 
with a simple lento respite. Barbagallo marked the abrupt changes of the presto 
sections by pedaling to suspend previous harmonies into current chords. He 
finished with an exciting, clamorously powerful but ever polished coda. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers also avoided unnecessary dramatics during his work with accompanist 
Timothy Steele. In Beethoven's cycle 'An die ferne Geliebte,' the tenor gave 
expressive attention to text and phrasing despite a raspy edge to the voice 
that periodically crept into soft, high sections. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist and singer were attentive to one another. In "Es kehret der Maien, es 
bluhet die Au," the fifth song in the cycle, Bowers turned tellingly to listen 
to Steele's introduction from which he drew his caressingly wistful mood. 
Steele, who leaves after this weekend to begin a free-lance career in Boston, 
supported with movingly emphasized, colorful chord changes. 
</P>
<P>
Following intermission, Bowers concentrated on two sets of works by 
conservative 20th-Century American and English composers. He infused the first, 
three of five pleasantly impressionistic songs from Louise Talma's cycle "Terre 
de France," with a quiet sensitivity to floating melodies. 
</P>
<P>
The four sentimental love songs that composed the second set were saved from a 
descent into maudlin nostalgia by Bowers' serious delivery. Most captivating 
among these was Frank Bridge's "Love Wene A'Riding," marked by a dramatic flair 
that Bowers had already demonstrated in an excerpt from "Joseph," by Mehul.

The Pentagon today announced that U.S. Navy ships are holding a "short-notice 
exercise" with forces of the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf area, 
where tensions have heightened over Iraqi threats against Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, meanwhile, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said both 
Iraq and Kuwait had built up their forces and U.S. officials are "very 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq and others know there is no place for coercion in a civilized world," she 
said. "All disputes should be handled through peaceful means." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Williams, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters he could provide no details 
on the exercise beyond saying that it began Monday and that two Navy vessels 
left early from their port at Bahrain, midway up the gulf, in order to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
Williams declined to comment on the purpose of the maneuvers or say whether 
they were scheduled before Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last Friday accused 
Kuwait of stealing $2.4-billion worth of oil from wells on Iraqi territory and 
of trying to wreck the Iraqi economy by conspiring to push down world oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of the situation today, 
"We're concerned about the troop buildup by Iraq and we ask that all parties 
strive to avoid violence." 
</P>
<P>
Williams declined to comment on a Washington Post report today that U.S. Navy 
ships in the gulf had been put on alert in response to the tensions between 
Iraq and Kuwait. He said Pentagon policy prohibits any comment on alert status. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon spokesman said U.S. policy toward the gulf region has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We would take very seriously any threats . . . to U.S. friends in the region," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the United States would come to Kuwait's defense if attacked 
by Iraq, Williams said he could not comment.

Congressional Democrats extracted from President Bush a pledge to tone down 
political attacks during a two-hour budget session today that failed to narrow 
crucial differences on curing the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Bush agreed to a temporary political cease-fire after blistering Democrats in 
recent Republican fund-raising speeches around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be very gentle" from now on, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made no mention of contentious budget issues during a midday speech to a 
GOP audience in Philadelphia, focusing instead on praise for his selection of 
David H. Souter for the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Participants said congressional leaders suggested at today's Oval Office 
session that political attacks and counterattacks have hampered efforts to 
strike a bipartisan budget deal. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things discussed today was to stop the political debate and start 
the substantive debate and to try to cut down on the political comment that's 
gone on on all sides," said House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're going to see that that will happen," he added. "I think a lot 
of that's out of everybody's system." 
</P>
<P>
In political speeches last week in Western states, Bush ridiculed the budget 
process and suggested that it was now the Democrats' turn to make concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, speaking to reporters on Air Force One en route to Philadelphia, 
said Bush and the Democrats were "working in a spirit of harmony and 
compromise." 
</P>
<P>
"They agreed this morning at the meeting that they would try to keep the 
rhetoric under control and really try to make this a productive week of work," 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Another White House session with the five top congressional leaders -- 
Gephardt, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and House 
Minority Leader Bob H. Michel (R-Ill.) -- was scheduled for Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a larger group of budget negotiators was meeting on Capitol 
Hill today in an effort to narrow differences. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the political truce, Bush and Congress seemed no closer to agreeing 
on a way to close the deficit gap than they were before the President revoked 
his 1988 "no new taxes" pledge. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration estimates that the deficit for fiscal 1991, which begins 
Oct. 1, will be nearly $169 billion -- more than $100 billion over the 
$64-billion target set by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional and Administration negotiators are trying to find at least $50 
billion in savings to be divided about evenly between spending cuts and new 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt, who chairs budget-summit negotiations when the President is not in 
attendance, said that "fundamental differences remain" on taxes, defense 
spending and cuts in "entitlement" social programs. 
</P>
<P>
He said these differences may frustrate efforts to reach agreement by the 
August congressional recess, "but we're going to give it the good old college 
try."

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion immediately fell 
on the Irish Republican Army. The killing of a nun would be seen widely as a 
grave embarrassment to the mainly Catholic IRA. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb, planted in a drain beneath a road, blew apart an unmarked police car, 
instantly killing the three officers traveling in it. The nun, who died later 
in hospital from severe injuries, was traveling with a woman social worker in a 
separate car caught in the blast.

Early results from the primaries of Mongolia's first free parliamentary 
election indicated today that the Communists will continue their seven-decade 
rule, but the democratic opposition predicted it would win a share of power for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The government announcement on Sunday's voting left some confusion over the 
parties' strength, but international observers monitoring the election said the 
Communists, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, appeared likely to win 
in the final round this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition charged some voting irregularities but acknowledged that the 
balloting had been generally free and fair. International observers, speaking 
on condition of anonymity, agreed.

A congressional panel asked a special prosecutor today to broaden his probe of 
former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., saying it has evidence Pierce 
steered money to clients of his former law firm and may have committed perjury. 
</P>
<P>
In urging independent counsel Arlin Adams to expand his investigation, the 
House Government Operations housing subcommittee said its 14-month probe 
uncovered "widespread abuses, influence peddling, blatant favoritism, 
monumental waste and gross mismanagement" at HUD. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee specifically asked Adams to widen his investigation into three 
areas of possible wrongdoing: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whether Pierce committed perjury during the only appearance before the 
subcommittee, on May 25, 1989, in which the former Cabinet officer gave 
detailed testimony. The congressional panel said many of Pierce's statements 
were contradicted by subsequent testimony. Pierce essentially maintained that 
he did not play a direct role in the awarding of housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whether Pierce conspired with others to steer HUD business to clients of 
Battle, Fowler, Jaffin &amp; Kheel, the Wall Street law firm where Pierce had 
been a partner. It also questions whether Pierce conspired with his former top 
aide, Lance Wilson, in connection with contract awards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whether Pierce and other HUD officials "conspired to defraud" the 
government in the handling of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's 
coinsurance program, which provided backing for housing development projects 
during the Reagan Administration from 1981 to '89. 
</P>
<P>
The letter came as the eight-member panel neared an end to its investigation of 
the HUD scandal. A subcommittee source, discussing the panel's role on grounds 
of anonymity, said no more hearings are scheduled. The aide said the 
subcommittee hopes to complete a final report, with recommendations for reforms 
at HUD, sometime late next month. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said documents found in HUD files show that Pierce's former law firm 
frequently sought Pierce's assistance in HUD-related matters. It said they 
included having Pierce meet with a client to discuss a development grant 
application and helping secure lucrative housing subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
It cited a letter from a partner in the firm to Pierce's assistant, Deborah 
Gore Dean, in 1985 seeking her help in obtaining a subsidy for an Amherst, 
N.Y., project and recounting past assistance in another project there, 
Allenhurst Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of Secretary Pierce's long and close relationship with his former law 
firm, Battle, Fowler, it defies logic and reason that Dean would have assisted 
Battle, Fowler in obtaining these scarce and much-in-demand (subsidy) units for 
the Allenhurst project on her own without the direct and intimate involvement 
of Secretary Pierce," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Glynn, a partner in Battle, Fowler and spokesman for the firm, said, "We 
are confident that no member or employee of the firm has engaged in any 
inappropriate conduct."

Vincent Van Gogh was neither a lunatic nor an epileptic but suffered from a 
common inner ear disorder that led the artist to cut off his ear and eventually 
kill himself, medical experts said in a report published today. 
</P>
<P>
They said the Dutch painter, who committed suicide 100 years ago this month at 
the age of 37, had Meniere's syndrome, characterized by a painful ringing or 
buzzing in the ear and vertigo -- attacks of disabling dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
The report from the Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, Colo., was based on an 
examination of medical records and Van Gogh's letters and was published in this 
week's Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
An examination of 796 of Van Gogh's personal letters "reveals a man constantly 
in control of his reason and suffering from severe repeated attacks of 
disabling vertigo, not a seizure disorder," the study said.

Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel has canceled controversial private 
meetings with Austrian President Kurt Waldheim scheduled for this week in 
Salzburg, the World Jewish Congress said today. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which had strongly criticized Havel for planning to meet Waldheim, a 
man it has accused of being "part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine," said 
it was informed of Havel's decision by Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry officials. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, a longtime dissident who assumed the presidency with the overthrow of 
his country's Communist government, has also come under fire at home from 
human-rights activists for planning the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
He and West German President Richard von Weizsaecker are scheduled to go to 
Salzburg on Thursday. It was not known whether the German leader would go ahead 
with his planned meeting with Waldheim.

Dow Chemical Co. said today that a soft market for its plastics and chemical 
products cut second-quarter profits 50% despite a 4.5% increase in sales. 
</P>
<P>
The second quarter is usually Dow's strongest, but sales volume failed to 
increase from the first quarter and anticipated price increases didn't 
materialize, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
"Industry fundamentals weakened in early June and are softer than a year ago 
when demand and prices were near all-time highs and supply generally was 
tight," said Enrique C. Falla, Dow financial vice president. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, plant maintenance shutdowns and production outages in several 
plants increased Dow's manufacturing costs, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Dow said net income fell to $364 million, or $1.34 a share, for the three 
months ended June 30, from $728 million, or $2.70 a share, for the second 
quarter of 1989.

for integrating defense businesses into the civilian sector. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, one of several introduced in Congress aiming to assist workers 
soon to be displaced as a result of defense cutbacks, would use 10% of the 
so-called peace dividend of defense cutbacks, or about $1 billion, to fund a 
package of severance and health benefits for laid-off workers and create a 
federal council to coordinate assistance to the workers. 
</P>

The plan, scheduled to operate for seven years, was announced at a news

THORNBURGH WARY OF HOUSE'S S&amp;L BILL;

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said today that legislation moving through the House 
would interfere with the Administration's pursuit of savings and loan fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, generally praised 
an anti-fraud bill adopted by the Senate two weeks ago, but he said sections of 
legislation moving through the House would be counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
One provision creates a National Commission on Financial Crimes, with members 
appointed by President Bush and congressional leaders, to study and recommend 
changes to the government's anti-fraud effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the proposed commission would be counterproductive . . . (and 
would) almost certainly interfere in the continuing aggressive investigation 
and prosecution of financial institution malefactors," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
He also opposed a House proposal to expand the jurisdiction of the Secret 
Service, an arm of the Treasury Department that already investigates 
counterfeiting, to include fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said the FBI, a Justice Department bureau, has the "necessary and 
proven expertise" to serve as the primary agency probing S&amp;L fraud. The 
House legislation, he said, "represents a cumbersome approach to addressing 
financial-institution offenses." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill provides $162.5 million in each of the next three years to 
increase the number of prosecutors and FBI agents pursuing S&amp;L cases. It 
also increased the maximum prison sentence for bank fraud from 20 years to 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said 
S&amp;L abuses, more prevalent in the Southwest and Southern California, are 
now turning up in the Northeast and Florida as well. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, complained that 
well-publicized sentences of S&amp;L executives ranging up to 30 years 
"unfortunately . . . are the exception." He ticked off examples of what he 
considered light sentences, including one year of unsupervised probation given 
an Alabama S&amp;L vice president found responsible for $2 million in losses. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va., 
maintains in a new study that fraud cost $5 billion, or only 3% of what he 
figures is the bailout's $147-billion total cost.

ABC'S 'CHINA BEACH' JUGGLES DECADES

<TEXT>
<P>
ABC's "China Beach" will move not only to a new time next season. In some 
episodes, it will travel to new decades, its producer says. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam War series goes to Saturdays at 9 p.m. in the fall and, in the 
season pilot, jumps forward to the year 1985, executive producer John Sacret 
Young said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The acclaimed drama that chronicles nurses and doctors attending to war has 
been set in the 1960s since its debut two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, the series also will follow the main characters' lives in sequences 
that occur in the 1970s and 1980s, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"The characters are going to have a wild ride," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach," despite laudatory reviews and an Emmy award last year for star 
Dana Delany, had a wild ride itself this season. 
</P>
<P>
Never a ratings winner, the dark depiction of life in the trenches faced an 
uncertain fate until ABC renewed it for the fall at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
Network entertainment President Bob Iger said he hopes the show's new time 
slot, which will precede ABC's cult hit "Twin Peaks," helps to ensure its 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
Young and Delany, speaking to television critics Monday, said they were 
surprised the visceral series has lasted this long. 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach" premiered as a spring replacement series in 1988. "I didn't think 
the pilot would get picked up," Delany said. 
</P>
<P>
Next season, Delany's character, the hard-drinking, emotionally stifled nurse 
Colleen McMurphy, will be shown as an oft-married woman in flash-forward 
sequences, Young said.

A cagey bit of programming worked for NBC in the weekly television ratings, 
with the conclusion of a two-part movie grabbing the top slot this week and 
Part 1 scoring high the last time around, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's broadcast of Part 2 of "Love and Hate: A Marriage Made in Hell," 
starring Kate Nelligan, was the top-rated show in the weekly Nielsen ratings 
for the week of July 16-22. 
</P>
<P>
Part 1 of the miniseries, broadcast July 15, placed sixth in the ratings for 
the week of July 9-15. The show's ratings were the third-highest for all NBC 
miniseries broadcast this season, following "Blind Faith" and "Drug Wars: The 
Camarena Story." 
</P>
<P>
In other good news for NBC, the July 17 special "Real Life with Jane Pauley" 
tied for fifth place, the highest-ever rating for a network news special. Five 
"Real Life" specials have been scheduled for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Reruns of the perennially top-rated "Cheers" (NBC) and "Roseanne" (ABC) were in 
second and third place respectively and ABC's "20/20" zipped to fourth place, 
compared with its 21st place showing a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was a three-way pileup in seventh place, with Fox's "The Simpsons" and 
"Married . . . With Children" tying with NBC's "Golden Girls." 
</P>
<P>
"The Miss Teen USA" pageant broadcast on CBS rounded out the top 10. Some usual 
top 10 finishers, CBS's "60 Minutes" and NBC's "The Cosby Show" and "A 
Different World," were bumped to 11th, 12th and 13th places respectively. 
</P>
<P>
A rerun of NBC's "Quantum Leap" outpaced two original shows in the prime-time 
race July 18, placing 39th over ABC's Barbara Walters special "The Perfect 
Baby" (41st place) and CBS's "Top Cops" in 43rd place. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won five nights of the week -- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and 
Saturday -- its first such showing since Feb. 26. ABC won Friday night and 
Sunday belonged to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
For the week ending July 22, it was the 10th consecutive win for NBC with a 
10.2 rating and a 20 share, followed by CBS with an 8.7 rating and a 17 share. 
ABC had an 8.4 rating and a 16 share and Fox posted a 6.1 rating and a 12 
share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Deborah Norville got a New York taxi driver fined for cursing at her during a 
ride in December. 
</P>
<P>
The co-host of NBC's "Today" show told New York magazine she hailed a cab 
driven by Isidro Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
When she arrived at her destination, Norville said, she tapped on the partition 
window to tell Ortiz where to drop her off. She said Ortiz cursed her and 
became more abusive when she began to write down his license number. 
</P>
<P>
Norville said that she refused to give him a tip and that Ortiz slammed shut 
the money vent and sent the fare flying. A coin struck her in the eye, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was absolutely shaking when I got out of the car," she was quoted as saying 
in the magazine's July 30 issue. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz, 31, was fined $100 at a hearing April 2, said Rebecca Bowser, Taxi and 
Limousine Commission spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The cabbie has an unlisted telephone number and could not be reached for 
comment.

LIZ SMITH: NORA DUNN TAKES A STAND BUT LOSES 'SNL' JOB 
</P>

<P>
FOR FIVE seasons on "Saturday Night Live," comic actress Nora Dunn was best 
known for her characterizations on that long-running NBC institution: vapid 
talk show hostess Pat Stevens . . . one half of the singing Sweeney Sisters. 
But then came Andrew Dice Clay, chosen to host the May 12 edition of "SNL." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn publicly repudiated Clay and absented herself from the show, as did the 
scheduled musical performer Sinead O'Connor. The firestorm of publicity brought 
both praise for her stand and skepticism of her motives. And many felt that 
Dunn had, no doubt inadvertently, helped Clay's career. Now Nora Dunn is out of 
"Saturday Night Live," her contract not renewed. Producers insist this is not 
some sort of punishment for bucking the male-dominated environment of "SNL." 
They say it's just show biz, you know? 
</P>
<P>
Nora Dunn sat for an interview with Mother Jones magazine, conducted by Davis 
Beers, shortly before NBC announced her services would no longer be required. 
In the September/October issue, she speaks out on the Andrew Dice Clay debacle 
and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ostracized by most of the people I work with, including most of the 
cast," she said, "and I was never given any reason for that other than what I 
read in the paper." Dunn said, months later, very few cast members or 
co-workers have spoken to her. 
</P>
<P>
Her stance on Clay is unwavering: "He has the right to say whatever he wants; 
you then have the responsibility to stand up against it. You can't disconnect 
yourself from reality -- the kind of rapes that are happening, people beating 
up gay men. This kind of stuff Clay does fuels that kind of thought. It's too 
easy to slip into that fascist way of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
And yet for all this, Dunn has not joined the National Organization for Women 
in its condemnation of Esquire's June issue, to which she contributed a 
four-page photo parody: "I think when you start condemning things you need to 
focus on what's important. I would not compare Esquire with Andrew Dice Clay. . 
. . I don't take it seriously. It's not about rape." 
</P>
<P>
IVANA TRUMP is in Paris, viewing, oohing and aahing the fall collections. But 
she's not buying a thing. That's the fun part of her Parisian jaunt. Ivana is 
always the busy working woman, however she is also meeting with tapestry, wall 
covering and china experts in preparation for the licensing of her Plaza 
Collections line of accessories and toiletries and what have you.

IBM DROPS TV ADS FOR PGA TOURNEY TO PROTEST CLUB'S EXCLUSION OF BLACKS

IBM will not run television ads during the PGA Championship next month because 
of racial exclusion in the membership of the all-white Shoal Creek Country 
Club, site of the golf tournament, an IBM official said. 
</P>
<P>
IBM spokeswoman Gina Chew-Holman said that when the corporation learned of the 
racial issue, "we decided it would not be an appropriate vehicle for our 
advertising, supporting (the club) even indirectly." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the club, in Shelby County near Birmingham, said that it does 
not have any policy barring blacks from membership and that blacks have been 
guests. But the racial practices of the country club became the subject of 
widespread news reports when the club's founder, Hall Thompson, told the 
Birmingham Post-Herald that the club would not be pressured into accepting 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson later said he was quoted out of context and apologized to those he 
offended.

'GALLOPING GHOST' RED GRANGE IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE BATTLE

Harold (Red) Grange, football's legendary Galloping Ghost, has been found to 
have Parkinson's disease but should be home from an extended-care facility in a 
few weeks, his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't be going dancing," said Muggs Grange, his wife of more than 49 years, 
"but he's going to outlive all of us." 
</P>
<P>
The 87-year-old Grange, one of the 17 charter members in the Pro Football Hall 
of Fame, went in for a checkup last month at Lake Wales Hospital and was 
hospitalized briefly, Mrs. Grange said. 
</P>
<P>
He was moved to the extended-care facility early this month and is receiving 
physical therapy because the disease has affected his mobility and speech, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Grange was the rage of the 1920s when he made the number 77 famous during a 
fabulous career as a running back at the University of Illinois and later in 
the National Football League with the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Grange's speed and electrifying performances helped catapult football from deep 
inside sports sections to front-page headlines across the country. He once 
modestly admitted, "Yes, I think I brought some attention to the game." 
</P>
<P>
Grange played at Illinois from 1923 to '25 and in his junior year scored four 
touchdowns in one game within a period of 12 minutes, racing 95, 67, 56 and 45 
yards against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged more than 8.4 yards a carry and more than 10 points a game for his 
combined college and pro career.

BASEBALL: TEXAS RANGER PITCHER HANDCUFFS 5,000 PLUS, HURLS SIX NO-HITTERS, NOW 
GOES FOR HIS 300TH CAREER VICTORY.

When Nolan Ryan signed with the Texas Rangers as a free agent in December, 
1988, three numbers swirled in his head. 
</P>
<P>
Five thousand. Six and 300. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the only numbers that really mean something to me," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, the all-time strikeout leader, struck out Rickey Henderson for No. 5,000 
last summer and has added 202 since. His sixth no-hitter, against Oakland last 
month, came after several close calls since his record fifth in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Ryan goes for his 300th victory against the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan declined to discuss going for No. 300 until last Friday night, when he 
beat Detroit 5-3 for No. 299. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can start thinking about it," he said. "I don't think about no-hitters 
until the ninth or so, I didn't think about 5,000 until I was close and I 
didn't think about 300 until I had 299." 
</P>
<P>
Just about everyone else has been thinking about it all season. And now, 
Ryanmania has struck again. Even Ryan is caught up in it, agreeing to a news 
conference today to accommodate the hundreds of interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some 300-win pitchers, Ryan is on a hot streak as he approaches the 
coveted number. Despite nagging back problems, Ryan is 5-0 with an 2.63 ERA in 
his last six starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good," Ryan said. "My back won't keep me from starting Wednesday, but 
it's just one of those things that'll need five weeks of rest to completely 
heal." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night's game was sold out on July 20, the earliest sellout in Rangers 
history, said Tanja Burgdorf in the team's public relations office. 
</P>
<P>
One fan in the Dallas suburb of Plano bought six tickets to take his family to 
the game, but got an unexpected collectible when his wife chose not to go. 
</P>
<P>
The $8.50 unused ticket would be worth at least $50 if Ryan wins, said Jim 
Milholland of Dick's Dugout sports collectibles shop in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think they're crazy for not going to the game if they have a ticket," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some examples of Ryanmania: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Local newspapers are running daily updates on Ryan remaining calm as the 
pressure mounts, and radio stations are giving fans up-to-the-minute reports on 
Ryan's ailing back. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The razor company for which Ryan does TV commercials is poised for the 
Texas pitcher's 300th career victory. Since Ryan is 43, BIC said when Ryan wins 
No. 300, all 43-year-old men in the United States will be offered a free trial 
pack of BIC Metal Shavers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ryan memorabilia was a hot item at the 11th National Sports Collectors 
convention in Arlington earlier this month. Rangers Manager Bobby Valentine 
even doled out hundreds of dollars for a Ryan rookie card. 
</P>
<P>
A mint 1968 Topps rookie card of Ryan recently sold for $3,900 at a Florida 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Five hundred people entered a Ft. Worth Star-Telegram contest titled "Ryan 
Expressions," in which they wrote in 25 words or less just how special the 
Rangers pitcher is to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The winner, James Fleschener of Arlington, wrote: "Nolan brings back memories 
of days gone by. Playing ball during the endless summer days with childhood 
friends. Nolan is my personalized fountain of youth."

OZZIE CANSECO TALKS, WALKS LIKE TWIN, BUT BAT? NO WAY, JOSE

<P>
He looks like his brother Jose -- more than a little up close, and so much so 
at a distance that if the two traded jerseys the crowd never would know. The 
faces are almost the same. So are the hard, sculpted bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Canseco walks like Jose walks, and talks like Jose talks, and jerks his 
head shoulder-to-shoulder to loosen the cords in his neck the same way Jose 
does. 
</P>
<P>
In the on-deck circle, with a bat in his hands, he even swings like Jose -- 
feet apart, the stance open, the stick (a Jose Canseco model, naturally) held 
high and a-wiggle. 
</P>
<P>
But there the similarities end. 
</P>
<P>
Between the lines, as they say, there is no mistaking Jose and Ozzie Canseco, 
the Oakland A's twins who turned 26 only three weeks ago. One has 153 home runs 
in the big leagues already, while the other has none. 
</P>
<P>
Osvaldo Capas Canseco, in fact, still has no HITS. 
</P>
<P>
And probably no Jaguar or Porsche, either. 
</P>
<P>
He was called up from Huntsville of the Double-A Southern League last Wednesday 
and struck out on three pitches in his big league debut that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
So did his brother in his first big league at-bat, the club was quick to point 
out. 
</P>
<P>
But Ozzie bounced out twice and flied out twice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Then he pinch-hit on Saturday with the game on the line and struck out. 
</P>
<P>
And on Sunday he went 0 for 2, grounding out, striking out. To here, he is 
nothing for 8. 
</P>
<P>
When Jimmy Key walked him in his ninth try at bat, he did well to find first. 
</P>
<P>
When he did, people cheered him. Folks here are with Ozzie, who didn't play in 
Monday night's game with the Angels, and it isn't hard to see why. 
</P>
<P>
It is simple enough to imagine how it must be, having a twin who looks just 
like you, walks like you walk, talks like you talk, who is the same as you are 
in every way you can measure. And who will probably break Babe Ruth's record 
some day, while people consider you lucky when you hit a loud foul. 
</P>
<P>
Did Frank Sinatra have a twin brother who turned out to be tone deaf? 
</P>
<P>
Did Errol Flynn have one who couldn't get girls? 
</P>
<P>
Or Pablo Picasso one who was merely a house painter? 
</P>
<P>
How tough must it be to be Ozzie Canseco, with a locker right next to his 
brother's, and see the people with note pads coming up to Jose, begging a 
minute of his time, tugging on his sleeve for a quote? 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, no one at all spoke to Ozzie Canseco, not even the batboy. 
</P>
<P>
Funny, the curious twists that a lifetime can take. 
</P>
<P>
The A's drafted Jose out of high school. Ozzie spent a season in college. Both 
could throw hard, but someone decided Jose was an outfielder and Ozzie a 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
After three years in the minors, Jose made it big. Ozzie spent three years 
learning to pitch, and just when he seemed to be getting the hang of it (3-2 at 
Sarasota, 5-4 at Ft. Lauderdale), someone decided he wasn't a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
He hadn't had a bat in his hands for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
It still shows. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't exactly tearing up Huntsville, hitting .229, with 19 homers and 85 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
And Saturday, sent up to hit in the ninth against Toronto's Tom Henke, Ozzie 
appeared overmatched. The capacity crowd took up the hopeful chant, "Oz-zie! . 
. . Oz-zie!" But Ozzie took a couple of swipes and didn't even come close. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, he bounced to shortstop the first time, then fanned on four pitches, 
swinging at three without contact. 
</P>
<P>
But in the sixth, Key fell behind 3 and 1, and the crowd began buzzing. The 
left-hander would have to come in with a pitch. Ozzie would have a free rip. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, he missed big, the way his brother misses, swinging so hard that he 
almost fell down. If he had made contact, he might have driven the ball all the 
way to Nevada and maybe have nailed down a spot on the roster. Instead, on the 
next pitch he walked. 
</P>
<P>
His batting average is still .000. 
</P>
<P>
He is the sentimental darling in these parts, but this is not a sentimental 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Norris, who had pitched his way back after years on the shelf, was quietly 
released last Sunday, for no better reason than that he was old, and the good 
teams do not cut their young. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Steinbach is due off the disabled list today. A catcher will be cut to 
make room. Carney Lansford is due back three days later, however, and Willie 
Randolph another three days after that. 
</P>
<P>
The future seems fairly predictable for the brothers Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
One has a ticket to the game's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The other, for Huntsville.

WORLD'S BEST FEMALE JOCKEY RIDES AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>

BROKEN ARM AND BEING OUT OF ACTION FOR EIGHT MONTHS.

<P>
It might be a day late, but Julie Krone could not have picked a better way to 
celebrate her 27th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The world's best female jockey is returning to racing at Monmouth Park on 
Wednesday after being out for eight months with a career-threatening broken 
left arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really looking forward to Wednesday," Krone said. "Just being back will be 
the best reward. If I win my first race, I think I just might cry." 
</P>
<P>
Krone has shed a couple of tears since the night of Nov. 24 when her mount, My 
Rolin, went down at the Meadowlands Racetrack, shattering the rider's arm in 
four places. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery was performed that night and a bone graft was done in March. 
Rehabilitation followed, and there have been more than a few times when Krone 
has wondered about her career. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't get back onto a horse until earlier this month and things weren't 
going well, at first. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started back I was doing the wrong things and I'd get tired," she 
said. "Instead of sitting still, I'd be wiggling my hands all the time. Then 
the horse would get strong and so I'd pull and get more tired. Everything was 
out of sync." 
</P>
<P>
Things started getting better in the middle of last week when Krone galloped 
Make A Decision for trainer John Forbes. Suddenly, rider and horse were in 
sync. The timing was there and that ever-present Krone smile returned. 
</P>
<P>
The final step is getting back into the saddle competitively, which is 
something Krone has never had trouble doing in recent years. She has won 1,899 
races since becoming a jockey nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Krone won 368 races, the third highest in the country, and her 
mounts had earnings of $8.03 million, 10th in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Krone, who has won the last three riding titles at both Monmouth Park and the 
Meadowlands, is listed to ride three horses Wednesday -- Ampart Slew in the 
fourth race, Gandad in the fifth and Castle Dell in the eighth.

ISRAEL'S NEW POWER PLAYER; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN MINISTER DAVID LEVY HAS THE POLITICAL BASE FOR A MORE INDEPENDENT 
POLICY. BUT DOES HE HAVE THE WILL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When David Levy, Israel's new, Moroccan-born foreign minister, was named to his 
job by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, he was met by a wave of insulting ethnic 
jokes that painted him as plain stupid. 
</P>
<P>
But the scorn has run its course. Israelis are now turning their attention to 
whether Levy, viewed widely as a deft politician, will defy predictions and 
revive plans for peace talks that had been given up for dead. 
</P>
<P>
The speculation is intense because Levy brings an unusual level of political 
independence to the office. As the most prominent politician from Israel's 
largest ethnic community -- those Jews who emigrated from Morocco and their 
descendants -- Levy is a power in his own right. By contrast, the position of 
his predecessor, Moshe Arens, depended mainly on the patronage of Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
If Levy chooses, he could chart a course for change that, observers say, would 
stand up to challenge from ideologues within the ruling Likud Party whose 
constituencies are less firm or widely based. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a force in Likud. He can play a pivotal role in keeping the party 
together if the going gets tough," said a top Foreign Ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
Levy has defined his mission as a quest to restore close relations with the 
United States. Assuming Washington continues to center its Middle East policy 
on brokering Israeli-Palestinian talks, Levy will quickly run into a dilemma: 
whether to satisfy the Bush Administration or maintain the rightist Israeli 
government's resistance to the American formula, which includes an offstage 
role for the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
It was Levy's Moroccan heritage that underlay the barrage of jokes. (One 
described him saluting a refrigerator because the brand was General Electric). 
Israeli society is fragmented between Jews of North African and Near Eastern 
origin and those of European descent, with the Europeans harboring feelings of 
superiority. Inevitably, if you heard a Levy joke, it was from European lips. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Levy's Sephardic, or Oriental, origin that buttresses his power. 
Israelis who trace their origins to Arab countries constitute 60% of the 
country's population. 
</P>
<P>
As a gauge of Levy's relative influence, political observers noted that he won 
from Shamir the post of foreign minister, his first choice. By comparison, 
Ariel Sharon, the former general who is considered a backstage power in the new 
government, was sidelined to the Housing Ministry after failing to win the job 
of defense minister, which he openly coveted. 
</P>
<P>
Since assuming office last month, Levy has shown no signs of taking a new 
approach to the issue of peace with Palestinians, although it may be too early 
to tell. 
</P>
<P>
His launch as foreign minister was interrupted by a mild heart attack from 
which he is still recovering. On doctors' advice, he turned down an invitation 
from U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III to meet in Paris to discuss 
peace issues. The meeting has been rescheduled in Washington during the second 
week in August. 
</P>
<P>
In public statements, Levy emphasized that he will not cave in to Washington 
pressure for Israeli-Palestinian talks. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is a superpower, but Israel is not its satellite," he told 
Yediot Aharonot, his nation's largest newspaper. "We will not accept dictates, 
and we will not give up on issues that are vital to our existence and our 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Levy was one of three politicians in the Likud Party -- Sharon and current 
Finance Minster Yitzhak Modai were the others -- who fought efforts by the Bush 
Administration to set up talks to include Palestinian residents of Jerusalem as 
well as Palestinians expelled from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The three styled themselves the "constraints ministers," and their opposition 
helped four months ago to bring down the fragile ruling coalition that had 
joined Likud and the more dovish Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, that coalition was replaced by a narrower, Shamir-led version made 
up of Likud, far right and religious parties. 
</P>
<P>
As housing minister in the last government, Levy approved secret government 
funding to help a nationalistic Jewish group acquire a Greek Orthodox building 
in a predominantly Arab-occupied section of Jerusalem's Old City. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar over the Jewish takeover of the building, called the Hospice of St. 
John, upset many American officials, including congressional supporters of 
Israel. When Congress later approved a $400-million loan guarantee for housing 
Soviet immigrants, the legislators subtracted a $1.8-million fee -- the exact 
amount of the contribution that Levy arranged for the disputed purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Associates of Levy paint a picture of a politician who is at once pragmatic and 
committed to Likud dogma, including the tenet that the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip belong to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all constraints ministers in Likud," said Parliament member Eliyahu Ben 
Elissar, a confidant of Levy's. "The blunder of the U.S. Administration was 
that it thought it could bring us to do things we will not do -- talk to the 
PLO." 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that Levy will make no move to accommodate Washington, Ben 
Elissar stressed. But it will be along the lines of reducing immediate tensions 
between Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
One such confidence-building proposal floating around is an offer to reduce the 
troop presence in the West Bank and Gaza in return for an end to stone throwing 
by rebellious Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a practical man," advised Ben Elissar, "but don't expect gifts." 
</P>
<P>
The silver-haired Levy, 52, immigrated in 1957 and joined Likud as a labor 
leader having firsthand knowledge of working conditions among Israel's 
disadvantaged Sephardic population. As a young man, he worked as a ditch 
digger, cotton picker and construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were terrible days," he said in a biography. "I realized that I had to 
do something to change my situation. I saw that I had to find a road that would 
lead to the corridors of power." 
</P>
<P>
A father of 12 children, he still commutes to Jerusalem from his home in Beit 
Shean, a parched, unprosperous community near the Jordan River in northern 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Levy was first elected to the Knesset (Parliament) in 1965 and 12 years later 
gained a Cabinet seat as immigration minister under then-Prime Minister 
Menachem Begin. Levy's tenure as housing minister dated from 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Biographers say Levy resents Israel's European elite as personified by the 
Labor Party, which dominated the first three decades of Israel's political 
life. Complaining about the treatment of Sephardic immigrants in the 1950s and 
'60s, Levy has been quoted as saying: "Why do they take people who come with 
goodwill and a lot of love for the land of Israel and grind it into sand?" 
</P>
<P>
He also expresses a certain disdain for intellectuals and once snidely referred 
to Moshe Arens as "the elegant professor." 
</P>
<P>
Levy has shown an independent mind during major political conflicts in Israel. 
Unlike Shamir and Arens, Levy backed the conclusion of the Camp David peace 
treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
He criticized the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and raised a voice of caution 
against Israel's use of its Christian Lebanese allies to help root out 
Palestinian "terrorists" from then-Israeli occupied West Beirut -- a decision 
that paved the way for the subsequent massacre of hundreds of defenseless men, 
women, and children in the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps. Levy also cast a 
key vote in favor of Israeli withdrawal from most of Lebanon in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Some negative barbs directed at Levy have focused on his lack of 
English-speaking ability in a post that requires frequent, direct contact with 
Americans. Defending himself, Levy told a radio interviewer, "There are some 
English-speaking people who can't make themselves understood anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Hebrew, Levy speaks French and Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
He makes no secret of his ambition to succeed the aging Shamir as prime 
minister. "If you ask me if, through my struggle and through the way I have 
progressed, I aspire to the throne of prime minister, I say yes," he told a 
newspaper interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
It is this ambition that fueled his desire for the prestigious post of foreign 
minister. Ministry professionals have been cautioning the Americans not to 
treat Levy with disdain. "He is a man with pride. Just look at how he keeps 
himself. Not a hair on his head out of place," said one senior official. "He 
must be treated with dignity." 
</P>
<P>
As a potential successor to Shamir, Levy is wary of daggers from his rivals, 
including the prime minister himself, associates say. The naming, at Shamir's 
urging, of Benjamin Netanyahu as deputy foreign minister was seen as a rein on 
Levy. 
</P>
<P>
Levy's campaign for power puts him on a collision course with Sharon, another 
self-declared candidate to succeed Shamir. Aides to Sharon are already 
complaining that Levy left the Housing Ministry in disarray and that he is 
partly to blame for the shortage of shelter for newly arrived Soviet 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials have been cautious in predicting how Levy will 
respond to the delicacies of international diplomacy. Typically, they 
characterize him as a "good learner" who is capable of surprises. Some predict 
that Levy will be swayed by the opinion of his constituency -- a constituency 
that on the one hand has been traditionally hawkish, but which also bears not 
only a large part of the military burden of occupation but also its economic 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Other observers warn that if Levy harbors hopes of improving relations with 
Washington, he will not be able to defend his ideological beliefs 
</P>
<P>
"If Levy the foreign minister acts like Levy the constraints minister, he will 
be in trouble," warned Haaretz, a liberal Israeli newspaper. "Not that the 
United states will immediately deal us a brutal blow, but (it) will define us 
differently -- no longer as a close ally."

UNION ORGANIZER RECLAIMS A PEOPLE'S ARTIST FOR THE PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ralph Fasanella grew up in an Italian immigrant family in New York City. His 
father was an iceman. His mother was a buttonhole maker with socialist 
sympathies. The Depression hit when he was a teen-ager. His father left. 
Fasanella became a union organizer, went to Spain to fight against fascism in 
the Spanish Civil War and returned to organize. 
</P>
<P>
Around the time World War II was ending, Fasanella was trying to relieve a 
persistent soreness in his hand. He took a pencil and started rubbing it on 
paper. Bingo! He gave up union work and became an artist. He got by by pumping 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
He painted what he knew. Colorful canvases of working class life. Family 
dinners. Political rallies. His father crucified on ice tongs. Subway riders. 
May Day. Strikes. He painted with his heart, focusing on communities where what 
people did for a living became the center of their world. 
</P>
<P>
He became quietly respected as a "primitive" or "naive" painter, someone whose 
talent spoke through the sweep of his art rather than technical precision. Then 
in 1972 New York magazine put him on its cover, proclaiming: "This man pumps 
gas in the Bronx for a living. He may also be the best primitive painter since 
Grandma Moses." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, a union organizer named Ron Carver saw an exhibit of Fasanella's 
paintings in a New York gallery. Carver's first impulse was to try to find a 
way to display some of the paintings in his hometown of New Bedford, Mass., so 
his union members could see them. But it wasn't until more than a decade later, 
in 1986, that he was able to organize a showing of 30 Fasanella paintings at a 
New Bedford museum. 
</P>
<P>
The museum was around the corner from Carver's office. He would go there daily 
on his lunch hour. "I'd leave just floating high. I was so moved and inspired." 
</P>
<P>
But he was also outraged. After all, Fasanella's work was such a vibrant public 
experience, and yet virtually all of his paintings were held by private 
collectors, lent for exhibit only occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
So, in 1988, when he was quitting his job and mulling over what union to work 
for next, Carver decided to make himself happy, albeit exhausted. He gave 
himself the next two years to raise funds to buy back some of Fasanella's 200 
paintings from collectors and place them on permanent display in city halls, 
parks and universities. As Fasanella had lived by pumping gas, Carver would get 
by by doing free-lance union consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
Carver organized a New Bedford community group to buy one of a series of 
paintings by Fasanella commemorating a successful 1912 uprising by textile 
workers in Lawrence, Mass. From there, momentum started to grow. Labor leaders 
in a variety of states began campaigns to purchase various pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The prices asked by collectors have been steep, ranging from $40,000 to 
$150,000, and in a number of cases collectors have refused to part with the 
pictures. Still, eight paintings have now been purchased or donated and are on 
permanent public display in Massachusetts, Michigan and Maine. 
</P>
<P>
And, at 75, Ralph Fasanella is a famous artist. In New York last month, he was 
honored by Mayor David N. Dinkins at a reception at Gracie Mansion to begin the 
Immigrant Family Labor Heritage Project, established to acquire Fasanella's 
"Family Supper," a work dedicated to his parents and their tenement. The goal 
is to raise $130,000 to buy the painting from a New York City collector by 
summer's end and exhibit it at the Ellis Island Immigration Museum, due to open 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight in Washington, Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.) and leaders of labor and Italian-American organizations will 
kick off another fund-raising effort to place Fasanella's acclaimed mural, "The 
Great Strike -- Lawrence, 1912," on permanent display in the U.S. Capitol as a 
tribute to immigrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always an uplift," Fasanella said, struggling to describe his reaction to 
the wave of recognition. "But you know, what the hell, I've been in it so long 
-- here I am, an old labor painter. When I painted these things, I thought they 
would be hanging in union halls. That's why I made them so big -- four, five, 
six feet. I never really painted for individuals. I was just telling the story 
of my life. Now, they're going to be placed in Ellis Island, the Capitol 
Rotunda . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Fasanella is feeling what Ron Carver remembers feeling on the day that 
New Bedford dedicated a Fasanella painting. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like we'd won the World Series," said Carver, who will be returning to 
a regular union organizing job soon because his wife has a baby on the way. 
"Everyone walked around in town with a smile. That's what all of this has been 
like."

THEATER: INTERVIEW FOR GARDEN GROVE'S 'EVE' GETS MCGILLIS' IRISH UP 
</P>

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Celebrity has its privileges, and haughtiness apparently is one of them. As 
Kelly McGillis declared the other day, asserting one of her prerogatives: "I'm 
a movie star. I can say no." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why officials of the Grove Shakespeare Festival must be gnashing their 
teeth over their recent attempt to court the press with what amounted to Kelly 
McGillis Day in the lounge of the Gem Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The high-strung actress, best known as Tom Cruise's co-star in "Top Gun," 
turned out to be unnecessarily defensive in her role as Visiting Celebrity, 
despite volunteering to help publicize "A Midsummer's Night's Eve at the 
Grove." 
</P>
<P>
Grove officials hope to net $25,000 from the fund-raiser, which is set for 
Monday at the outdoor Festival Amphitheatre. The benefit performance of 
Shakespearean scenes and readings will feature McGillis, along with Gregory 
Itzin, Kamella Tate, Daniel Bryan Cartmell, John-Frederick Jones and Carl 
Reggiardo. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the other players, McGillis has never appeared in a Grove production. 
But her connection with artistic director Thomas F. Bradac goes back further 
than any of theirs. She credits Bradac with introducing her to theater when she 
was a student at Newport Harbor High School, and he was her drama teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom was the sole reason I became an actress," recalled McGillis, 32, who has 
also starred on screen in "Witness," "The House on Carroll Street" and "The 
Accused." "We've remained friends over the years. I really admire what he has 
done here. So when he asked me to be on the board, I said yes." 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't mean she had to be pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her predictably laudatory press-conference remarks about how happy she 
was to be at the Grove last week -- both as a newly appointed trustee and as a 
cast member of the upcoming benefit performance -- McGillis looked less and 
less happy. 
</P>
<P>
Outfitted in jeans and a dark blue sports jacket, she chain-smoked her way 
through an interview with The Times, dismissing questions about substantive 
issues that might have elicited thoughtful answers and replying testily to 
other questions about the paradoxes of her career. 
</P>
<P>
To a request for her opinion about right-wing efforts to dismantle the National 
Endowment for the Arts -- following up her press-conference generalities on the 
need to support regional theater -- she said: "I have views, but I don't think 
this is the place to tell them." 
</P>
<P>
To a query about how she feels when "Top Gun" is decried as a symbol of 
Hollywood's contribution to the decline of culture -- and, by implication, her 
role in it -- she snapped: "I suppose I resent the fact that people think I 
should be one thing or the other." 
</P>
<P>
And just in case anybody wanted to make something of her looks -- though nobody 
did -- she insisted: "I'm not Michelle Pfeiffer. I'm not Kim Basinger. I am not 
this beauty queen. I get to play interesting women. I like that. I'm very happy 
with who I am." 
</P>
<P>
Between refusing permission for a Times photographer to take a posed portrait 
of her ("I'm a movie star. I can say no") and accusing this reporter of making 
erroneous assumptions about her ("You're saying something stupid to me"), 
McGillis gave the impression of a blunt, temperamental star to whom the whole 
exercise seemed an uncomfortable invasion of her privacy. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, she even turned down the theater's request to have her picture 
taken with corporate donors for its own publicity photos. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, McGillis curiously volunteered revealing aspects of her 
personal life with virtually no prompting. 
</P>
<P>
Asked routinely about marriage and work -- "Is your husband (yacht-broker Fred 
Tillman) supportive of your career?" -- she said he was, and pointedly added 
that she had laid down the law: "When I first met him, I said, 'Never tell me 
to quit my job because I won't. I'll leave you first.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was her pregnancy last November that caused her to terminate a 
year's commitment to the Shakespeare Theatre at the Folger in Washington a 
couple of months after getting there. 
</P>
<P>
McGillis, who gave birth to a daughter at the end of May, had been brought to 
the Folger by another former teacher -- director Michael Kahn, who had met her 
13 years ago at the Juilliard School in New York. 
</P>
<P>
After starring at the Folger as Viola in "Twelfth Night" -- winning a Helen 
Hayes Award for her performance -- she withdrew from her contract to play the 
lead roles in "Mary Stuart" and "The Merry Wives of Windsor." 
</P>
<P>
"I was sorry I couldn't stay," said McGillis, who currently lives in Marina del 
Rey. "But I'm very happy to be a mother. It's life, and you can't deny that. 
Sometimes real life is bigger than theater. Just sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she is already discussing a return to the Folger two seasons from now 
to do "Measure for Measure." She also is executive-producing a television piece 
based on Kate Chopin's novella, "The Awakening" -- in which she will star -- 
and is negotiating for a new movie. 
</P>
<P>
At the Grove benefit, McGillis is to perform a scene from "Twelfth Night" with 
Kamella Tate and a scene from "Much Ado About Nothing" with Gregory Itzin, as 
well as solo readings from "Henry V," "Twelfth Night," "The Merchant of Venice" 
and "The Tempest." 
</P>
<P>
In all, the cast of five plans to present nearly 1 1/2 hours of highlights from 
17 of Shakespeare's 37 plays, woven together by a narrative text written for 
the occasion by Itzin. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Midsummer Night's Eve at the Grove" will be presented July 30. It is to 
begin at 5 p.m. with a gallery showing of original works by artist Jean Pol d. 
Franqueil, followed by dinner at 6 p.m. and the stage presentation at 8 p.m. in 
the Festival Amphitheatre, 12852 Main St., Garden Grove. Tickets: $125 for the 
full evening; $50 for the stage presentation only (students and seniors $25).

Within a few blocks of the headquarters of Foster's Family Donuts in Simi 
Valley sits one of the doughnut chain's stores. So does the local Winchell's 
Donut House. So does the local Donut Inn. 
</P>
<P>
It's like that in most Southern California cities, where one can hardly find a 
strip center devoid of doughnuts. And therein lies the competitive struggle 
that Warren J. Foster, the founder and president of Foster's Family Donuts, and 
his franchisees must try to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Foster has won his share of battles, though. Since its founding in 1970, 
Foster's has become one of the larger independent chains in the area. It now 
owns 15 stores and franchises another 40 outlets from San Diego to Sacramento 
and in Idaho. Together they generate between $15 million and $18 million a year 
in sales, said Foster, who owns the company with his wife, Patricia. 
</P>
<P>
The secret? Foster, a Winchell's alumnus, asserts that his doughnuts are bigger 
than his competitors' and that he doesn't wage price wars, leaving Foster's 
doughnuts often 50% to 85% more costly than his rivals'. The higher prices help 
keep profit margins fatter -- he won't discuss just how fat -- without 
alienating too many customers and keep Foster's franchisees happy. 
</P>
<P>
A recent spot check of a few Foster's outlets in the San Fernando Valley 
confirmed that its doughnuts are larger than similar selections at Winchell's. 
But Foster's pricing tactics aren't uniform throughout his franchises. An 
assorted dozen doughnuts cost $2.99 at a Foster's in Chatsworth, just pennies 
below the $3.19 charged by a nearby Winchell's. Another Foster's in Canoga Park 
charged $4.30 for a dozen. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Foster treats his competitors as equals, saying no one chain gives 
him more trouble than another. 
</P>
<P>
That bravado seems to be common in the doughnut business, which is led in 
Southern California by the 580-store Winchell's, a unit of Canada's Shato 
Holdings Ltd. Indeed, Foster's gets the same ho-hum reaction from its rivals, 
bigger doughnuts or not. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no real distinction between them and the other independents," said 
Arthur Pfefferman, chairman of Donut Inn, a 40-store chain based in Woodland 
Hills. "They don't have any significant marketing or market share per se." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Galastro, who three months ago was named the president of struggling 
Winchell's, also lumped Foster's with the rest of the crowd. "Anybody who puts 
out a quality product is competition," Galastro said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Foster has more expansion planned. He wants to add stores in 
Sacramento and San Diego, and to set up shop in small communities in Nevada and 
Montana. "They're the type of towns we look for," because they usually have 
just one or two mom-and-pop doughnut stores, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, 58, runs his enterprise from a modest, one-room office in the middle of 
his company's warehouse, where it stockpiles flour, mixes and other supplies 
sold to its franchisees. Helping out are six of Foster's nine children and one 
son-in-law. Foster and his wife, who have lived in Simi Valley since 1963, also 
have 13 grandchildren and have housed about 30 foster children at various times 
over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
A stocky, tanned Colorado native with razor-straight gray hair and matching 
mustache, Foster -- whose likeness appears on his stores' doughnut boxes -- 
said he spends most of his time on the road visiting franchisees and 
trouble-shooting their problems. 
</P>
<P>
Franchisees pay an initial $25,000 fee to get a Foster's shop, but it costs 
close to $100,000 to get a store up and running. Franchisees then pay 5.5% of 
their gross sales to Foster's in royalties, and an additional 2% to a fund that 
pays for the chain's advertising and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
Foster declined to give the average per-store sales or discuss profits. But if 
the chain's total sales are $18 million, that works out to $327,270 in average 
per-store sales. Lop off the 5.5% for Foster, and multiply times 40 (the number 
of franchisees) and Foster would collect roughly $655,000 a year in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
The franchisees get 30 days or more of training and help in picking out a 
location. Foster said he looks for people who are "self-motivating, being able 
to handle money, being able to work with employees and having pride in what 
they do." 
</P>
<P>
Foster first learned the doughnut business while working 14 years at 
Winchell's, where he rose to the executive vice president at its supplies 
division and had a seat on its board of directors. But he quit in 1969 when 
Denny's Inc. bought Winchell's, deciding "I could do better." 
</P>
<P>
He opened his first two stores in Ventura, emphasizing "better service, a 
tastier product," Foster said. He also kept making doughnuts through the day to 
counter the way "Winchell's schooled a lot of our customers into the idea that 
you bake at night and you don't bake any more." 
</P>
<P>
Foster said he also avoided price wars. "Whatever Winchell's did, everyone 
followed suit," he said. "We never did. We stood off by ourselves, maintained 
our prices and had very loyal customers." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell's Galastro declined to comment specifically on Foster's pricing 
claims, but said, "You always are aware of what the competition is doing." And 
it appears that despite Foster's pricing strategy, some of his franchisees do 
what they please when it comes to prices. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's because of the mushrooming number of competitors. "We'll go in 
next door to the competition; we don't like to, but we have," Foster said. "You 
can't run and hide your head. You've got to believe in what you're doing."
