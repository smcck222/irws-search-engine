CHULA VISTA RESORT PLANS ARE DETAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of Chula Vista's bayfront has unveiled details of a $500-million 
proposal to build a sports-oriented resort and convention center by San Diego 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista Investors, a developer whose principal is William Barkett of 
Stockton, said Monday it is proposing a resort that would have as its 
centerpiece a 36-court tennis center managed by Nick Bollettieri, the 
Florida-based teacher of Andre Agassi, Jimmy Arias, Aaron Krickstein and other 
professional tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
The sports-oriented resort would also feature an indoor ice-skating rink, a 
health spa and gymnastics center, besides the tennis courts, Barkett said. The 
sports facilities, in tandem with extensive hotel and convention development on 
the property, would attract many tourists and business groups to the South Bay, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The previously announced project, designed by Horton Plaza architect Jerde 
Partnership of Los Angeles, would also feature two artificial salt-water 
lagoons next to San Diego Bay that would not empty into it for environmental 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Question of Density 
</P>
<P>
However, Barkett's plan is more dense than the city's community development 
staff and some City Council members feel comfortable with. The Chula Vista 
Investors group wants to build more than six hotels on the property, with a 
total 2,028 rooms, as well as 1,550 apartment and condominium units and 150,000 
square feet of office and retail buildings. 
</P>
<P>
With 4.2 million square feet of buildings, the project would be nearly twice as 
densely developed as the proposal put forth by the property's previous owners, 
a partnership of Watt Industries and Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. The 
partnership sold the 426 acres to Barkett last year after reaching an impasse 
with Chula Vista over how to develop the property. 
</P>
<P>
The development plan calls for several high-rise structures, including two 
26-story hotels, one 16-story hotel and three 16-story residential towers. The 
proposal would use 112 acres of the property, with the rest set aside for 
marshland. The proposal will require approval by Chula Vista and the state 
Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chula Vista officials say they strongly favor commercial development 
of the bayfront as a means of generating more tax revenue and tourism, several 
described the Chula Vista Investors proposal as too jammed with buildings and 
too commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"The major problems are there is too much development overall, and I don't 
believe it has enough public access areas," said City Councilwoman Gayle 
McCandliss. "The general open space and park area the plan is designating is 
minimal. I would like to see more general recreation uses, a la Mission Bay, 
available for the residents of Chula Vista." 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista Community Development Acting Director David Gustafson said Friday 
that his staff has concerns that the 22.4 acres of open space in the project 
devoted to parks and other public uses are inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some are concerned that the bayfront, which is viewed as a community 
resource, could become a privileged enclave," Gustafson said. "And there is 
concern about how the project with its high-rises will integrate with the rest 
of Chula Vista." 
</P>
<P>
Also lining up against the project's current configuration is Crossroads, a 
Chula Vista community group that advocates slow growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Grossly in Excess' 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's grossly in excess," said Crossroads' outgoing president, Peter 
Watry. "High-rises in themselves are not bad. You might want to trade those off 
for lots of open space. But Barkett doesn't do that either. If he were to build 
his plan, and you drove through it, you would never know you were on the 
bayfront because his plan cuts off all view corridors with the high buildings." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, Barkett said he has met continuously over the past nine 
months with city and community officials in an effort to come up with an 
acceptable plan for the property. The proposal "takes in all the parameters of 
the city and regulatory agencies at arriving at the current density," Barkett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging the city's concerns about the "intensity" of the 
project, he declined to say whether he would down-scale the project to receive 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
List of Uses from City 
</P>
<P>
"The city gave us a list of uses they wanted to see on the property. So we took 
what the city wanted and tried to create something feasible to develop," 
Barkett said. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Worthington, the principal architect in charge of the bayfront project, 
said the high density of the proposal is mitigated by the "clustering" of its 
hotels around the man-made lagoons. "The primary objective was to create a 
resort village, rather than a resort with a number of hotels," Worthington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the resort is also designed to project "drawing power . . . it's 
important to understand we are trying to develop a destination resort to serve 
not just the local market but a real world class destination, a Pacific Rim 
conference and sports center." 
</P>
<P>
Barkett and city officials say the next crucial stage is the completion of an 
environmental impact report due out in September that will deal with the 
Barkett plan as well as four additional plans, including one encompassing the 
community development staff's recommendations. An economic feasibility study is 
also due shortly. 
</P>
<P>
Barkett had asked the City Council to give conceptual approval for his plan 
last month but withdrew the request after his attorneys advised him to wait 
until the environmental impact report was released. The report should give both 
the city and Barkett more detailed information on what uses the property can 
support, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bollettieri now runs a year-round, 46-court tennis academy in Bradenton, Fla. 
and is developing a similar center at the Princeville resort on Kauai island in 
Hawaii. He operates several seasonal tennis camps at other U. S. locations, 
including one at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bollettieri Tennis Academy Executive Director Ted Meekma, the 
project's tennis center element came about fairly recently when Barkett met 
Bollettieri at Davis Cup tennis matches in San Diego. Bollettieri subsequently 
agreed to manage all the sports activities at the proposed Chula Vista resort, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barkett's father, Joseph Barkett, controls the Stockton-based development firm 
called Emerald Properties, a closely held concern active in residential and 
commercial development, mainly in the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
William Barkett said the company will complete its first major San Diego 
project, a 180-room Radisson Hotel in National City that is scheduled to open 
Nov. 15.

DIRE RESULTS PREDICTED WITHOUT A NEW AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
STUDY FORESEES AIRLINE CONGESTION, LOSS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AS CONSEQUENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
San Diego will have one of the nation's most congested airports and lose 
billions of dollars in forfeited economic growth if no new airport is built by 
2010, a new study warns. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the overburdened Lindbergh Field with a larger airport would add $33 
billion to $53 billion to the region's economy over the next seven decades, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the San Diego Assn. of Governments (Sandag) and 
written by KPMB Peat Marwick of San Francisco, was made public Monday. By 
comparing the long-term economic impact of a new airport to that of Lindbergh 
Field, the study provides fresh ammunition for those arguing that San Diego 
must build a new field. 
</P>
<P>
The study echoes "what we and others have been saying for a long time," said 
San Diego Councilman Ron Roberts, a major proponent of a new airport. "What 
surprises me is the magnitude of the problem -- both the potential losses and 
the congestion at Lindbergh." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Stand Taken 
</P>
<P>
But, although the report estimated the economic impact of both options, it did 
not endorse either of them, cautioned Sandag special projects director Jack 
Koerper, who heads the group's airport relocation study. 
</P>
<P>
"If people want to use this information, then that's their right," Koerper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The report is full of information that might spur debate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turnover Expected to Double 
</P>
<P>
It predicts that Lindbergh Field's current passenger turnover of 10 million 
annually will double by the year 2011. Even before that happens, passengers can 
expect average flight delays of five to 10 minutes, and 25 minutes to one hour 
and 40 minutes during peak hours, congestion comparable to that of Chicago's 
O'Hare airport, the authors noted. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, airlines would begin to divert flights from San Diego and stop 
expanding their local operations, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Failure to replace Lindbergh Field with a new airport would cost the region 
48,000 airport jobs by 2060, the authors predicted. That year, Lindbergh Field 
could accommodate 25 million passengers, while 40 million could pass through a 
new airport if one was built, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The industry that has more at stake than most is tourism, said Sandag economist 
Marney Cox. Of the $1.22 billion Lindbergh Field contributed to the local 
economy in 1988, $700 million was money spent here by visiting air travelers, 
the report said. Tourist spending would account for much of the money generated 
by a new airport (and lost if it is not built), Cox said. But he said the 
report did not address how many visitors would come to the city by other means 
of transport when faced with an overcrowded Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The latest report is part of a continuing Sandag study of San Diego's airport 
system, including plans for a new airport. Next month, planners will take one 
last look at Lindbergh Field to see if it could be expanded to satisfy the 
region's future needs, Koerper said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed alternatives include two sites in and next to the Miramar Naval Air 
Station and one on the U. S.-Mexican border on Otay Mesa.

AIR STATION CRASH TAKES LIVES OF 2 NAVY FLIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An EA-6B Prowler, an electronic warfare plane used by the Navy to jam enemy 
radar, crashed Monday while taking off from North Island Naval Air Station, 
killing two of the three airmen on board. 
</P>
<P>
Based at the naval air station on Whidbey Island, Wash., 80 miles northwest of 
Seattle, the twin-engine jet was operating out of North Island while on "a 
routine training mission" when it crashed at 5:38 p.m., Cmdr. Bob Pritchard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The surviving airman was flown by military helicopter to the Navy Hospital in 
Balboa Park, where he was listed in stable condition Monday night. The names of 
the crew were being withheld pending notification of next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debris Along Runway 
</P>
<P>
A storage shed at the end of the runway was destroyed in the accident, 
Pritchard said, with wood and debris from the plane scattered along the length 
of the airstrip. He said no other property, civilians or naval personnel were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Observers at the scene reported pieces of the fuselage being strewn along the 
runway and a thick black smudge lining the airstrip for a distance of about 600 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard said the plane "hit the ground and just burst into flames," sending 
up a plume of black smoke that was seen for miles. He said the cause of the 
crash was unknown but that an investigation was "already under way," with a 
report expected today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Crash 
</P>
<P>
As Navy investigators were sorting out the details of the EA-6B crash, an F-14 
Tomcat fighter went down 10 miles east of San Clemente Island at 8:57 p.m. 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard said that "two crewmen of Fighter Squadron 51, homeported at Miramar 
Naval Air Station" ejected from the F-14 and were picked up at 9:43 p.m. by 
"small craft in the area." He said the men appeared to be in good condition 
late Monday night, but the F-14 was "lost at sea." 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard said the Tomcat, an "air superiority fighter," is assigned to the 
aircraft carrier Carl Vinson but was flying out of Miramar when the crash 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
He said names of the crew members were being withheld. San Clemente Island is 
about 50 miles west of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard said the entire fleet of Grumman-made EA-6Bs is based at Whidbey 
Island. He said the plane went down several hundred yards from the ocean, and 
all the debris fell on land, just shy of the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just at the end of its takeoff," Navy Lt. Jack Papp told the Associated 
Press. "It crashed just as it reached the end of the runway. There was nothing 
left. The plane's a complete loss." 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard said the EA-6B can accommodate a four-man crew, but only three 
officers (one pilot and two electronics specialists) were on board. He said the 
plane is used "for countermeasures, for degrading enemy radar," and the crew 
was what's known as a replacement squadron that went by the Navy designation of 
VAQ-129. 
</P>
<P>
"These were gentlemen who had their wings," Pritchard said. "They were 
experienced aviators, just learning the particulars of the EA-6B, the aircraft 
they'd be flying, prior to joining the fleet." 
</P>
<P>
Navy spokeswoman Mary Ann Heiserman said by telephone from Whidbey Island that 
the EA-6B is an all-weather electronic aircraft specializing in 
"countermeasures." She didn't know the age of the EA-6B that crashed but said 
the first one was built in 1971. She said that it was part of the "tactical 
electronic warfare squadron" based at Whidbey and that training missions, 
calling for flights in and out of naval air stations, are common. She said the 
Prowler is designed to be launched from a carrier and jam land-based enemy 
radar during bombing missions. 
</P>
<P>
The weight of the EA-6B when empty is 32,162 pounds. It can carry an internal 
fuel load of 15,422 pounds, according to "Jane's All the World's Aircraft." Its 
"maximum level speed" at sea level is 651 m.p.h., with a cruising speed at 
optimal altitude of 481 m.p.h. It was originally unarmed but is now being 
equipped to carry anti-radar missiles underwing.

VOTE SCHEDULED TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
SUPPORTERS OF KING MEMORIAL TAKE THEIR CASE TO PORT'S OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Facing the probable defeat today of a proposal to rename the San Diego 
Convention Center for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., supporters of the name 
change handed over petitions and held a candlelight vigil Monday at the offices 
of the San Diego Unified Port District. 
</P>
<P>
Port Commissioner Daniel Larsen said Monday that he would vote against the name 
change because it lacks widespread support. His position leaves backers of the 
change one vote short of a majority on the seven-member Board of Port 
Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"A vast majority of people want it to remain as it is as a matter of pride in 
their city, not racism," Larsen said. "They don't want to name it after anyone. 
They resent the fact that the 16 people who make up the port commission and the 
City Council are making a decision of this magnitude" and not placing it on the 
ballot for the voters to decide. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen declined to comment further, saying he "didn't want to fan the flames 
for either side." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Promise 
</P>
<P>
Larsen has come under fire from council members and supporters of the name 
change for publicly reversing his position. His statements contradict a public 
promise of support for the tribute, which he made to the San Diego City Council 
on Jan. 17. The council had voted in favor of the name change Jan. 10, but the 
proposal requires the approval of both agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the council cannot direct its appointed port commissioners to 
vote in certain ways, and cannot remove them for failing to follow through on a 
political promise, according to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Jacobson, a coordinator with the Martin Luther King Tribute Coalition, the 
sponsors of the candlelight vigil, challenged Larsen's contention that public 
opinion is against naming the center after King. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got about 2,000 individual statements and the support of more than 60 
community groups. We have more support than the opposition," Jacobson said. 
"We're just trying to make a point that there's strong commitment from the 
community" for naming the center after King. The petitions contain more than 
8,000 signatures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's alternate proposal of an "Avenue of Honors" on the convention 
center's bay-front terrace, with King as its first inductee, is inadequate, 
Jacobson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Avenue of Honors' 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the commissioners have said publicly that they will not rename 
the center, and they dodged the issue during a controversial vote Feb. 21, 
proposing the "Avenue of Honors" instead. At the urging of Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor, Commissioner Louis Wolfsheimer agreed to bring the name change issue 
before the commissioners again. 
</P>
<P>
While some supporters of the change expressed hope that the port might still be 
swayed, others felt the chances were slim because of the commissioners' public 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
"There is that feeling that the possibility of (the name change) occurring at 
this time is minimal," said C. Terry Whitesides, interim president of the San 
Diego Urban League. "There is a lack of confidence in the port by the 
community. Personally, I don't think (the name change) is going to happen at 
this time, and I think that's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Such a defeat of the proposal would "send the city back to square one" in 
finding a suitable tribute for the slain civil rights leader, said Paul Downey, 
O'Connor's spokesman. "It puts us back where we were after the Market Street 
vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in 1987 overwhelmingly approved a referendum stripping King's name from 
the downtown boulevard and returning its original name after the council 
decided in 1986 to change the name of Market Street to Martin Luther King Way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat of Referendum 
</P>
<P>
A citizens committee appointed by the council last year suggested naming the 
convention center for King, setting in motion the controversy that has 
smoldered throughout this year and created the threat of another referendum by 
a citizens group opposed to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Clyde E. Gaines, chairman of the citizens committee, said he feels 
there is more support for the name change than the commissioners are willing to 
admit. A referendum to overturn the convention center renaming would be 
defeated, Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just a different sentiment to this" than the vote to strip King's name 
from Market Street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen, Chula Vista's Robert Penner and Coronado's Raymond Burk said Monday 
that they would not vote to rename the center for King. Milford Portwood of 
Imperial Beach could not be reached for comment Monday, but in the past he also 
has expressed opposition to the change. 
</P>
<P>
National City's Delton Reopelle said Monday that he will vote in favor of the 
name change. San Diego appointees Wolfsheimer and William Rick could not be 
reached for comment, but have said they support the name change. 
</P>
<P>
Burk said he opposes the change because he does not think naming the center for 
King "is really an honor." 
</P>
<P>
"He was a man of government, of letters. He was not a convention man. . . . The 
City Council should name the new civic center after King. That would be a more 
suitable honor," Burk said. 
</P>
<P>
Port commissioners meet at 2 p.m. today at the Holiday Inn Embarcadero.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN COCAINE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of three men accused of trying to kill five law enforcement officers when a 
cocaine deal in Inglewood soured pleaded guilty Monday to related drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Briggs, 30, of Lakewood, pleaded guilty to one count of attempted 
cocaine distribution, thereby avoiding trial on conspiracy, assault and 
attempted murder charges, said Assistant U.S. Atty. John Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Bishop, 19, and Dwight Weisner, 22, both of Los Angeles, face trial today 
on those charges as well as drug distribution counts stemming from their 
alleged dealings with undercover officers in the parking lot of an Inglewood 
grocery store on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs will be sentenced Oct. 2 by U.S. District Judge James Ideman. 
</P>
<P>
A nine-count indictment said the three men tried unsuccessfully to run down the 
five officers with a Chevrolet Blazer. The officers were two Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents, police officers from Gardena and Hawthorne and a 
sheriff's deputy who were working on the Los Angeles Street Gang Drug Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment said Briggs negotiated the sale of two pounds of cocaine to 
undercover officers and arranged for the transaction to take place in the food 
store's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment said Briggs introduced one of the officers, who was posing as 
the buyer, to Bishop, and the officer agreed to buy half a pound of the cocaine 
for $4,400. The deal went awry when backup officers converged on the men, 
Gordon said.

DIVERS FINISH BIG CUTS ON TANKER; 
</P>
<P>
LAST OF JUTTING STEEL PLATES REMOVED FROM EXXON VALDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Divers cutting away at the damaged hull of the Exxon Valdez have removed all 
seven steel pieces jutting from the ship, and Monday trimmed a large patch of 
steel that had begun to blister, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The last of the sagging plates -- two smaller pieces, each about 20 feet long 
-- and minor patches of steel sagging from the hull were cut off the tanker's 
bottom by the salvage divers Monday. Another two or three days will be needed 
for the trimming. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the crippled vessel drifted about 5 miles off San Clemente Island amid 
swells up to 3 feet, the Coast Guard reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Sea conditions have allowed them to make good progress. The priority now is to 
make sure we don't have any additional plates that fall," said Jan Cool, a 
spokeswoman for Exxon Shipping Co. "The attempt now is to make sure we're 
stabilizing the situation with the hull and eliminating further deterioration. 
At this point, we feel like we've been able to arrest the danger by removing 
these plates." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drifting Offshore 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the state and Exxon Shipping Co., after several days of 
deliberation, continued Monday to review final drafts of an agreement to allow 
the ship to enter state waters for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
An Assembly committee on oil-spill prevention and response is meeting in San 
Diego today to hear testimony about the condition of the Valdez since it 
arrived offshore San Diego on July 10. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Exxon, the Coast Guard, several state agencies, local 
environmental organizations and San Diego County are expected to testify. 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez was towed to San Diego from Alaska for repairs after smashing into a 
reef on March 24 and spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil along the Prince 
William Sound shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
But the tanker has been drifting off San Diego after the discovery of the 
jutting plates and an 18-mile oil slick believed to have come from the ship 
delayed its entry into San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
No discharges of a bluish mixture of weathered oil and marine life, observed 
coming from the ship several days after its arrival, have been seen for eight 
days, the Coast Guard reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Concerns Voiced 
</P>
<P>
All seven pieces of steel, some up to 70 feet long and weighing 50 tons apiece, 
were allowed to drop to the ocean floor 3,000 feet below the ship because of 
concerns for the divers' safety, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The dropping of the plates is not expected to harm the marine environment, 
Exxon and state officials said. But local environmentalists voiced some concern 
about the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's going to do major damage to the environment. Compared to 
the damage that's already been done by the Valdez, this is minuscule," said 
Rick Nadeau, director of Greenpeace in San Diego. "But, if they have the 
technology to remove (the plates), they should. The fact is, we're dumping all 
kinds of things into the ocean. This is just one more thing." 
</P>
<P>
The plates, peeled back from the hull during the tanker's transit from Prince 
William Sound, prevent the vessel from clearing the bottom of San Diego Bay, 
where it is expected to dry-dock at National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. for a 
nine-month, $25-million repair job. 
</P>
<P>
Officials originally had planned to move the ship, now about 5 miles off San 
Clemente Island in federal waters, into state waters, which extend up to 3 
miles from the coast, to remove the plates. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard gave Exxon permission to remove the plates in federal waters, 
but the company will have to abide by conditions set by the state when it 
enters San Diego Bay, officials said.

After serving as San Diego's Naval Base commander for just over a year, Rear 
Adm. W. Ivan Lewis Jr. was relieved of his duties Monday in a change of command 
ceremony at the Spreckels Organ Pavilion in Balboa Park. Rear Adm. John W. 
Adams, 54, previously stationed at North Island's Anti-Submarine Warfare 
station, takes over as Naval Base commander. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 59, was also awarded his fifth Legion of Merit on by Adm. David E. 
Jeremiah, commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, at the ceremony. Lewis 
officially retired Monday after serving 36 years in the Navy. He formerly 
served in Hawaii as logistics commander of the Pacific Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The primary responsibility of the Naval Base commander is to act as a liaison 
between the civilian and the naval community. The Naval Base commander is also 
responsible for the maritime defense of San Diego Harbor and is responsible for 
security on all of the naval bases in San Diego.

A single-car accident in Oceanside early Monday left one man dead and another 
facing possible manslaughter charges, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Espino Martinez, 21, of Mexico, was thrown from the car in which he was a 
riding when it overturned on North Santa Fe Drive south of Mesa Drive,

A Santee man was shot and killed Sunday in a dispute over a borrowed car, 
according to a spokesman for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
John Reynolds, 27, was shot in the back with a single shotgun blast at 6:53 
p.m. in his apartment, in the 8800 block of Olive Lane, said sheriff's 
dispatcher Chris Hinshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' roommate, Alan Anthonis, 28, scaled a back-yard fence and fled on 
foot, evading police dogs and a helicopter search, Hinshaw said. The men had 
argued about the condition of the car Reynolds had borrowed from Anthonis, 
according to Hinshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Anthonis was still being sought Monday night.

About 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled into San Diego Bay late Sunday when 
a Navy fuel supply line broke, officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
The spill occurred about 8 p.m. at a fuel supply facility on Point Loma 
Submarine Base, when a supply pipe broke while the Navy oil carrier Kiwishiwi 
was being refueled, a Navy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials Monday were uncertain why the pipe broke. 
</P>
<P>
Between 6,000 to 8,000 gallons of fuel poured from the supply line, but about 
3,000 gallons flowed into a dam designed to catch leaking fuel and another 
2,000 to 4,000 gallons was absorbed into the ground, said Chief Craig Huebler, 
a Navy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Two fuel skimmers and other cleanup equipment had cleaned the diesel fuel from 
the bay by mid-afternoon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy also sent a veterinarian to check on sea lions and other mammals in 
the area, including dolphins at a Navy research center nearby, and collected 
water samples to test for possible environmental damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Initial Navy reports showed no damage to the mammals or the marine environment, 
Huebler said. State Fish and Game Department officials are investigating.

<P>
Laughter is a return to childhood. We forget those who take us there. 
</P>
<P>
Today I learned of Mel Blanc's death and remembered how for four years I was 
chauffeuring him from his home in Pacific Palisades to the Hanna Barbera 
Studios for some dubbing. 
</P>
<P>
As we drove down Sunset, I told Mel, weakened by emphysema and forced to 
breathe with the aid of a portable oxygen machine, how much I had loved Bugs 
Bunny and Daffy Duck as a boy, but how I had always got Elmer Fudd confused 
with Porky Pig. 
</P>
<P>
We stopped for a traffic light. Mel removed the nostril clip from his oxygen 
tube and turning, began reciting the litany of voices we love him for -- Bugs, 
Daffy, Tweety, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam, Road Runner, the Flintstones and many 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Inside an idling Rolls-Royce in the next lane, two elegant ladies gaped at the 
elderly man going through his vocal imitations and the appreciative driver 
laughing as he listened. 
</P>
<P>
That's why it saddened me to learn, "Th-th-at-'s all, folks."

It is ironic that the great talents of Mel Blanc and Sir Laurence Olivier have 
been lost to us in a period of less than 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Both, in their own right, were masters of what they did. Mel was a man of 
dignity and possessor of a talent that gave us thousands of hours of pleasure 
for 50 years, and should long ago have been recognized by the Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences for giving so much for so long to so many. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Laurence was unquestionably one of the greatest actors of our time, and 
will be missed. Fortunately we have Olivier films and Mel Blanc cartoons . . . 
from one spectrum to another . . . to keep us laughing and dazzled by their 
great individual talents.

SEN. ROBERTI ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am quite disturbed that the pro-abortion crowd does not understand that a 
viable Democrat such as Roberti cannot hold his own view on abortion. If 
Roberti and many of his constituents see abortion as murder and denial of an 
inalienable right to life, how can he simply change his vote just so he does 
not have to come under the wrath of the pro-choicers? 
</P>
<P>
Would this group prefer that Roberti and many other Democrats move over to the 
other party and become Republicans? I would think not. It is ludicrous to look 
at only one issue. 
</P>
<P>
As good Democrats, we have to lead on many other issues, such as child care, 
equal rights for women and all people, health care, poverty, homelessness, 
crime and arms control and affordability of housing, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Those in favor of pro-choice, do what you have to do to defend your issue. But 
we have already lost thousands of Democrats to the Republicans; do not push 
more good Democrats into the GOP. You may win on the abortion issue, but we 
will lose on all the rest of the issues. Is it worth it?

STATE FARM AND PROPOSITION 103 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not so long ago a friend spent considerable time and energy trying to convince 
me that my vote is important, that it counts. Because I respect this person, I 
decided to give our democratic process a try. 
</P>
<P>
Last November I went to my local polling place and I voted in favor of 
Proposition 103. Wow, I won! Didn't I? 
</P>
<P>
Why should anyone cast a vote when insurance companies and individuals 
representing this state can and do set their will above the will of the people? 
</P>
<P>
If the insurance companies operating in California are not required to abide by 
the laws of this state, then the citizens should not be compelled to purchase 
their products.

AMERICA NO LONGER EXPECTS THE MOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.A. HEPPENHEIMER, T.A. Heppenheimer is an associate fellow of the American 
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first landing on the moon, 20 years ago, was supposed to point a path to 
the future. Today we are living in that future, and that feat appears as part 
of the heroism of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Despite President Bush's announced support for establishing a base on the moon 
and sending a manned mission to Mars, such ideas are likely to remain in the 
realm of plans and programs rather than of policies and funded projects. There 
are excellent reasons why. The Apollo moon-landing program, for all its 
self-conscious futurism, stands as a monument to vanished attitudes of its 
time. These attitudes dealt with government and with technology, and stand in 
sharp contrast to what we expect today. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo had its start in the early 1960s. At the time, there was sweeping 
enthusiasm for the ideal of government that brought Apollo into being. The 
ideal was that our government should feature a charismatic leader as President, 
who would push forward in a widespread program of governmental activism. John 
F. Kennedy gave America the very embodiment of this ideal, and the Apollo years 
-- the decade that followed his death -- can readily be viewed as a search for 
someone to replace him. Kennedy not only initiated Apollo but made it a 
centerpiece of his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, our expectations have changed. We are far less likely to give 
our hearts to vibrant and exciting new leaders, or to put our hopes in grand 
governmental programs with names like "New Frontier" or "Great Society." With 
Republicans having a virtual hammerlock on the White House, it is doubtful that 
John Kennedy could even be elected today. The contrast between George Bush and 
Kennedy illustrates something important: Americans no longer expect their 
Presidents to give them everything, including the moon. 
</P>
<P>
A second major attitude that drove Apollo, and which we no longer hold, was 
that government action could usher in the future. Government agencies would 
seize the opportunities of the time, lavish massive funding on them, and bring 
them into bloom. In particular, government could identify the most promising 
and significant new technologies, such as space flight, and turn dreams into 
realities. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, we put our hope not in government but in small companies and 
entrepreneurs. We expect that the technologies of the future will emerge, not 
through programs in Washington, but from the work of inventors in centers such 
as Silicon Valley. There is little interest today in "industrial policy," which 
was a Wash-ington catchword only a decade ago: Thenotion that government should 
select technology's winners and losers. This idea was at the core of Apollo. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo was pursued amid a widespread concern over national goals. In the '60s, 
opinion-makers often asserted that the nation should spend its effort and 
treasure on the pursuit of specific achievements: going to the moon, abolishing 
poverty, winning the war in Vietnam. Today we appreciate that the world is too 
complex to be neatly encapsulated in such government plans, and few such 
proposals come forth. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo also went forward amid a vague but widely held expectation that space 
flight would be the key to the future. Today, electronics holds the hope that 
formerly attached to astronautics -- and the difference between a desktop 
computer and Cape Canaveral illustrates the difference between these 
technologies. No entrepreneur could build a rocket for the Cape, but no federal 
program could put a computer on the desktop. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo also engendered the expectation that there would be major follow-up 
efforts of similar scope. The closest comparable activity was Synthetic Fuels 
Corp. of Jimmy Carter's Administration. This was a lavishly funded effort to 
seize the future by pursuing a new technical goal: that of producing gasoline 
and other synthetic fuels from coal. This project was soon abandoned under 
Reagan, and few lamented its demise. Though far less dramatic than Apollo, it 
drew from the same mind-set and exemplified the same attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, will we not soon return to the moon or go to Mars? We will not do 
these things for the same reasons we will not fight an overseas war or launch 
far-reach-ing new efforts aimed at social change. Our expectations are 
different, more modest -- and more realistic.

HEALTH CARE FOR ALL -- WITH LIMITS; 
</P>
<P>
TO AVERT A SYSTEM COLLAPSE, WE MUST DEFINE A BASIC PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN JOHNSTON, Brian Johnston is immediate past president of the Los 
Angeles Society of Emergency Physicians. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no question that the emergency medical-services system in Los Angeles 
is collapsing. Ask paramedics, and they will tell you how hard it is to find an 
open emergency department during peak hours, or when there's an outbreak of the 
flu. Talk to emergency physicians, and they will tell you that their 
departments are frequently overwhelmed by incoming patients for whom they can 
not find specialists or hospital beds. Ask the hospital administrators, who 
collectively subsidized the care of the poor by $402 million in Los Angeles 
County in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Our trauma-center system, with 9 of 23 centers closed, is no longer a system. 
Now our basic emergency system -- much more fundamental than specialized trauma 
care -- is failing. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the collapse is financial. More than one-quarter of the local 
population is uninsured and we have large numbers of illegal immigrants. The 
cost of health care is so high and rising so fast that insurance companies and 
employers are reducing benefits and denying payment for legitimate services as 
a means of controlling costs. Judging by their actions, the governor and other 
politicians have decided that they will pay no more for health care, regardless 
of the consequences. Politicians apparently have concluded that if spending 
more than 11% of the gross national product won't provide an acceptable 
standard of care in this country, then committing a larger share is unlikely to 
do so. In sum, government, private insurance and employers have put a cap on 
health-care expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
In this situation there are two threats to the public: one short-term and 
direct and the other indirect, and in the long run more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The short-term danger is that individuals, including the well-to-do and 
hard-working, will die needlessly despite their health insurance because the 
system will have collapsed for lack of financing. The county hospitals will be 
choked with poor people. Sufficient numbers of private hospitals will have 
closed or abolished their emergency services so that even those who have money 
will not be able to get care soon enough to save their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The more insidious threat is that such a grave collapse would prove to be the 
incentive for an ill-considered ballot initiative which, while attempting to 
meet the real needs of the 26% who are uninsured, will destroy our health-care 
system for the 74% who are covered. One has only to look at our recent history 
to see ballot initiatives that dealt simplistically with critical and complex 
issues. The Jarvis and Gann tax and spending-limit initiatives, the fight over 
insurance reform and the AIDS quarantine initiative are good examples of key 
issues that were oversimplified for the ballot and then obscured by competing 
advertising agencies. To subject our health-care system, whatever its 
shortcomings, to such treatment would be stupid and tragic. 
</P>
<P>
What we need instead is to develop a social consensus that will permit 
health-care delivery to all within a specified cost or cap. To do that we must 
abandon the notion that we can provide all health-care services to people 
regardless of their ability to pay. Instead, we must define a basic health-care 
package that we can afford to offer everyone. Then we need the political and 
moral courage to explicitly acknowledge that we will not "do everything 
possible" for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
This must be done on the basis of a social consensus because physicians, by 
their training and beliefs, will not withhold services that might save a life. 
I will do for my patients what I would do for a member of my family. I do not 
want to bear individually the burden of deciding who gets what care and who is 
denied. The public needs to be involved in deciding the total budget and should 
be advised by the medical profession on which interventions are cost-effective 
and which are not. 
</P>
<P>
Diagnostic and treatment options will have to be ranked by priority by the 
medical profession within a fixed budget, and when the budget has been 
exceeded, it should be mutually understood that further treatment will not be 
funded. As examples of how this might work, liver and bone- marrow transplants 
may benefit too few to be publicly financed, and hair transplants would most 
certainly not be paid for in the basic package. On the other hand, prenatal 
care, childhood immunizations and hypertension screenings are known to be cost- 
effective and most certainly would be funded. Such a system may seem 
hard-nosed, but it is kinder and more decent than our present system in which 
basic care is not defined and large numbers of persons get no care at all. 
</P>
<P>
Working within a budget makes more sense than refusing to do so and thus 
bankrupting government and threatening the entire health-care system. We are, 
in fact, rationing health care today. Los Angeles County has 4,363 licensed 
beds, but staffs only 2,928 of those beds, while turning away the poor. That is 
a form of rationing not subject to medical review. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, in cooperation with the state 
Legislature, should assemble a panel of respected and knowledgeable persons in 
business, government and medicine to specifically address the issue of 
health-care costs and uncompensated care. We must deal with this problem 
promptly and dispassionately, before the collapse of our present system 
provokes an intemperate and irrational response that would then be indelibly 
incorporated into the state Constitution as a result of a ballot initiative and 
an ad campaign.

GORBACHEV SEES VEIN OF OPPORTUNITY TO BE MINED FROM WORKER UNREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY F. HOUGH, Jerry F. Hough is a professor of political and policy 
sciences at Duke University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spring and early summer of 1989 have been times of political and social 
turmoil in the Soviet Union. Yet, while many have been treating the latest 
round of coal strikes as the beginning of the end for perestroika, the labor 
unrest is actually being used by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to accelerate economic 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
The coal strikes do not come as a surprise. Only 20% of the regional Communist 
Party leaders were defeated in the elections of March 26, but candidates from 
the coal-mining regions were particularly vulnerable. Then the extremely poor 
conditions in the coal fields were the subject of heated speeches at the 
televised Congress of People's Deputies that met in late May and early June. 
That workers would follow up with action of their own was a natural 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The strikes, however, are far more than a traditional call for higher wages. 
The key demands are usually those associated with management -- higher prices, 
with local mines receiving a proportion of the hard currency earned by the sale 
of their coal abroad. When the miners say they support perestroika, they don't 
just mean the right to strike. They are calling for radical economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the miners' concern is obvious. In the crazy-quilt system of 
Soviet pricing, coal is one of the items that is sold below cost to other 
factories. So long as the miners are paid wages out of the state budget, they 
don't care about prices. But with the new laws calling for self-financing (the 
payment of costs out of receipts), abnormally low coal prices mean a cut in 
wages to miners. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial fact about the coal strikes is not that they occurred, but that 
they have received so much attention -- often sympathetic -- in the controlled 
Soviet media. The reason is that they could not come at a better time: the eve 
of a major Central Committee plenum on nationalities. 
</P>
<P>
The plenum will deal first with decentralization of authority to the Soviet 
republics. As such, Russians are uneasy that Gorbachev is being too weak with 
the non-Russians and making too many concessions to them. The coal strike gives 
Gorbachev the ability to say that this decentralization is being demanded by 
Russians, too -- and by one of the core elements of the old working class. It 
also will legitimatize a continuation of the very thorough purge of 
conservatives that he has been conducting over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
We in the West desperately need to keep these events in perspective. For four 
years a number of observers have been saying that Gorbachev is teetering, that 
he is riding an uncontrollable tiger. As proof, they cite each incident of 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Yet every serious Western analysis -- and surely the Soviet leaders themselves 
understand this point -- notes that political reform will produce additional 
tensions to keep the political caldron boiling. 
</P>
<P>
The question has always been: Would this be the kind of escalating tension and 
political activity that has toppled many authoritarian regimes around the world 
and brought political democracy? Or would it be the kind of political turmoil 
we saw in America and Western Europe in the 1960s that would subside with time 
and a change in policy? 
</P>
<P>
In my view the latter is the case. Gorbachev is not riding a tiger. He is a 
Cossack firmly in control of his horse as he moves through tough terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, the saving factor for Gorbachev is the nationality conflict. The 
non-Russians are divided and can be controlled through a combination of 
concessions and repression. The first big riots -- and bloodshed -- occurred in 
Kazakhstan in 1986, when a Russian was named first secretary of that republic's 
Communist Party. Yet he proved a skillful leader; last March, virtually none of 
25 top leaders lost in the Kazakh elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Russians in turn can be restrained by appeals to national unity. The 
Siberian workers or Moscow students know that if they successfully push for 
complete democracy, separatist parties will emerge everywhere and some areas 
will leave the union. They are not ready for this. 
</P>
<P>
That is why Gorbachev can afford to publicize the strikes and the national 
demands in such an apparently reckless manner. The non-Russians will get the 
greater autonomy they seek, and that will help pacify them. The Russians too 
will get greater local independence and a rising standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
But the non-Russians making the most extreme demands will be kept in check. The 
troops will be called out periodically, as was the National Guard in America in 
the 1960s. This does not mean the system is collapsing or reform is over. The 
sky is not falling. We have to get on with developing a policy, not dreaming 
that it will.

IN WOODLAND HILLS, PRESERVATIONIST SPIRIT IS SHINING THROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The organizational meeting of the Woodland Hills Preservation Society on Monday 
was illuminating. 
</P>
<P>
First there was the unusually captive audience -- those attending were chained 
together around a lamppost at the corner of Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Dumetz 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
And there was the unusually quick approval of the agenda -- less than an hour 
after the meeting ended, Los Angeles city officials were hurriedly promising to 
pay close attention to the new group's first recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The fledgling society's suggestion is simple: The city should drop its plan to 
replace two dozen old-fashioned street lamps along a 16-block section of 
Topanga in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
City officials announced Friday that the 63-year-old globe-topped poles will be 
replaced starting in mid-August with 74 modern street-light fixtures. The 
$138,500 project is to boost the amount of light on the busy boulevard while 
reducing maintenance costs and electricity safety hazards, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But some Woodland Hills residents took a dim view of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quaint Town' 
</P>
<P>
"They look old and we like it," said homeowner Joe Molina. "For God's sake, 
this is not Century City or a new development like West Hills. Those lights add 
to the neighborhood and the sense of a quaint town. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking these lights out of the neighborhood would be like taking the frame off 
a painting." 
</P>
<P>
The fixtures were installed between 1923 and 1926 by Victor Giraud, the 
original subdivider of Woodland Hills. They have been retrofitted to use the 
same efficient and bright high-pressure sodium bulbs that newer poles use, said 
another resident, John Shugrue. 
</P>
<P>
"I just came back from my mother's house in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, where they 
have gone out and installed light poles like these all over," Shugrue said. 
"There's a town that's trying to preserve and serve, not tear everything down." 
</P>
<P>
Resident Bill Brady hastily gathered a few others at the corner Monday 
afternoon to demonstrate their concern. They wrapped themselves in a 10-foot 
chain and locked it to one of the threatened old poles, pledging that the 
tactic would be used if city crews showed up to rip down the lights. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first meeting of the Woodland Hills Preservation Society," Brady 
proclaimed. He predicted that the community's few remaining original street 
lamps are likely to be quickly yanked once those on Topanga disappear. They 
include four on Dumetz, 21 on Commercio Avenue and 14 on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
As the group unchained itself, passer-by Rhonda Walance hurried over. "Where do 
I sign the petition? I love these old lights," she said to Shugrue. "I'm tired 
of new places like Warner Center, where things are getting out of control." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Be Repaired 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who became aware of the objections Monday, quickly vowed to 
forget about the new lights if there is heavy community support for the old 
ones. They said cracks, which have made the 5,000-volt systems potentially 
dangerous, can be repaired in some poles. 
</P>
<P>
"If people want to object, now's the time," said Glenn Barr, a spokesman for 
City Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area. Barr said that the new 
lights seem like a good idea but that "if there's enough opposition, we'll 
listen." 
</P>
<P>
George Teal, associate city street-lighting engineer, said it's not too late 
for residents to save their lights. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the end of it if the council office doesn't approve of the 
project," Teal said. "If there is sufficient adverse reaction, we wouldn't 
proceed."

LANCASTER COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY VOTES TO GIVE ITSELF 20% PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lancaster City Council members voted unanimously Monday to give themselves a 
20% pay raise that will take effect next April. 
</P>
<P>
With no discussion, council members voted to raise their salaries from $500 to 
$600 a month, citing a state formula they said bases compensation for part-time 
council members on city population. The council became eligible for the $100 
monthly increase once the population exceeded 75,000 residents, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that the raise not become effective until after the next 
election, which is scheduled for April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other issues in the Antelope Valley, the raise for the part-time 
council was generated by the area's rapid growth. Lancaster grew 10% last year 
to its present size of 82,200 residents. Council members have said that the 
enormous amount of growth in the past several years has placed considerable 
demands on their time.

SANTA CLARITA WANTS CITY, COUNTY PLANS INTEGRATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council, eager to have a greater voice in planning for 
the entire Santa Clarita Valley, wants to join Los Angeles County officials in 
creating the planning blueprint that will guide expansion in the fast-growing 
valley for the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager George Caravalho said Monday that the city and county should 
coordinate their efforts to draft general plans for the region. At present, 
Santa Clarita and the county's Department of Regional Planning are preparing 
separate plans for virtually the same area. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to be put together and integrated," Caravalho said. General plans 
provide overall guidelines for development, specifying zoning and setting 
development priorities in a region. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to approve a letter tonight calling on County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich to direct planning officials to coordinate their 
efforts with Santa Clarita. The county planning department is tentatively 
scheduled to complete a draft general plan for the Santa Clarita Valley next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Wants to Catch Up 
</P>
<P>
The city is about two to three months behind the county in drafting its general 
plan. Santa Clarita wants the county to delay its efforts to allow the city to 
catch up, Caravalho said. 
</P>
<P>
Caravalho said the city and county staffs have had informal discussions about 
the county's proposed general plan, but "we do not feel that is adequate." The 
city would prefer a more formal coordination between the two governments, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Caravalho said the city also hopes to learn more about how the county plans to 
process a backlog of 45 general plan amendments that, if approved, would 
provide 38,000 more dwelling units in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has often expressed interest in developments outside the city 
and has repeatedly said it wishes to annex as much of the surrounding 
unincorporated territory as possible.

CHARGERS SIGN COURTNEY HALL FOR ONE YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
SECOND-ROUND CHOICE HOPES TO GET LONG-TERM DEAL SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Courtney Hall decided if he was to be the Charger center of the future, it was 
best the future begin as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
So rather than sit out any longer while his agent and the Chargers haggled over 
a long-term deal, Hall opted Monday to sign a one-year contract with an option 
year and join the Chargers for their morning workout. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, a rookie second-round selection from Rice, said he agreed to the one-year 
deal with an understanding that a long-term agreement will be worked on over 
the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"My agent (Marvin Demoff) and the Chargers were close enough that I could put 
enough trust in them to get everything ironed out while I'm in camp," Hall 
said. "It was best not to squabble over a couple of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
That means Hall can go on trying to win the job at center against two veterans 
-- Don Macek, who is coming off shoulder surgery, and Dennis McKnight, a 
starter at guard who was switched to center in minicamp in May. 
</P>
<P>
"I know (the Chargers) are going to give me every chance to prove myself," Hall 
said. "I know they are not going to play favorites." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement left the Chargers with two of their nine draft choices unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
But indications are that progress is being made to sign both players -- 
defensive end Burt Grossman, the first-round pick from Pittsburgh, and 
quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver, their second pick in the second round from 
Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman said from Pittsburgh that his representatives will go to San Diego 
this week to begin face-to-face talks with the Chargers as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman said he will be represented by his agent, Robert Jackson, and Gil 
Brandt, former Dallas Cowboys vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman recently switched to Jackson, a Cleveland lawyer, from Richard Woods, 
an agent whose clients include Bo Jackson. But Grossman said he broke from 
Woods about a month ago in a disagreement over insurance and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman said he agreed last week to be represented by Jackson but because 
Jackson has not handled football contracts in the past, he decided to enlist 
Brandt as an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman said his switch of agents delayed talks with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no problem with (Charger) management," Grossman said. "It was 
just changing agents and getting so long to get a new one. Now, I hope to get 
this done by Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver's agent, Vic Vines, said progress has been made in talks with the 
Chargers in the past few days. But he said the signing of Hall, who was taken 
14 picks ahead of Tolliver in the second round, will not provide a financial 
benchmark or affect his talks on Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
"We have said all along that Billy Joe Tolliver is a special case," Vines said. 
"We believe that he should get more than Courtney Hall." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also announced they signed Jamie Holland, their leading receiver 
and kick returner last season. Terms were not released. Last season, Holland 
caught 39 passes for 536 yards and one touchdown, and returned 31 kickoffs for 
810 yards and one touchdown. That leaves the Chargers with 11 unsigned players 
-- two rookies and nine veteran free agents. . . . Offensive tackle John Clay 
has reported after a one-day absence that Coach Dan Henning called a 
"miscommunication." Clay, who was acquired in the deal that sent tackle Jim 
Lachey to the Raiders, is recovering from a neck injury that forced him on the 
injured reserve list after the third game. Clay has not been cleared to 
practice, but Henning said he was supposed to report Sunday for a physical 
examination. Henning, without placing blame, said there was a mix-up among the 
team, Clay and his agent, Steve Feldman, about when Clay should report. Henning 
said the miscommunication "was not acceptable and it will not happen that way 
anymore." . . . To stay at the 80-player limit, the Chargers cut Mark Behning, 
a free-agent offensive tackle from Nebraska. Behning, a second-round draft pick 
by Pittsburgh in 1985, missed his rookie and 1987 seasons with injuries before 
he was let go by the Steelers during final 1988 roster cuts.

IT'S ANGELS WHO DO THE BASHING IN WIN OVER A'S 
</P>

OAKLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics' starters look more like offensive linemen than baseball 
players. The A's first seven batters Monday night averaged 6-foot-2 and 213 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Angels, however, who were flexing their muscles as Chili Davis and 
Jack Howell hit solo homers in a 5-4 victory in front of a sellout crowd of 
44,548 in the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who came up in the seventh inning with five hits in his last 38 at-bats 
and hadn't hit a home run since July 1, lined a shot over the fence in 
left-center. And Howell, who had one hit in his previous 24 at-bats, homered to 
center in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Both came against A's reliever Gene Nelson (2-5), who had given up only two 
home runs this season before Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"They've both persevered and come through with some big hits when we've needed 
them most," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "And that's more important than 
hitting .300." 
</P>
<P>
The homers gave the Angels a 5-3 lead, but the A's scored once in the eighth on 
a single by Rickey Henderson, a groundout and a run-scoring single by Mark 
McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Harvey came in to get the last four outs and earn his 13th save, but the 
Angels' version of Senor Smoke -- (that's what Rader does a lot of when 
Harvey's pitching) -- made it, well, interesting once again. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, who has walked 28 batters in 35 innings this season, was wild again 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
He ran the count to 3-and-0 on Jose Canseco, who was leading off the ninth, 
before striking him out on three called strikes. Then he walked Terry Steinbach 
on four pitches. Then he got Tony Phillips and pinch-hitter Ron Hassey on 
called third strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's not going to be perfect," Rader said. "Bryan got the four outs we 
needed. So he got three balls on a couple of people and walked a guy. That's 
just Bryan." 
</P>
<P>
The victory lifted the Angels to a one-game lead over Oakland in the American 
League West. Both teams have deemed this the who-cares series -- insisting it's 
too early for a showdown. But the Angels looked excited while running out to 
congratulate Harvey after the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it feels like to play in a playoff game, so I don't know 
what a 'playoff atmosphere' is like," Harvey said. "But hell, it's July. If we 
lose the next two here and we can't come back, we don't deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who is struggling at the plate these days, said the series carries a 
certain amount of importance. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally feel we can compete with these guys," he said. "But it's 
important that we win now and establish that. But it's still going to be a long 
year." 
</P>
<P>
If it wasn't a showdown, it was certainly show time. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big league game in every way," Rader said. "Did you notice how 
close the two teams' statistics were coming in? We had the same (team) batting 
averages and we had scored four more runs this season. It's unbelievable how 
close we are and the game reflected that." 
</P>
<P>
It started out as if it might be an Oakland blowout. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Kirk McCaskill, who missed his last start because of a tired arm, 
looked as if nine-days rest might not have been enough. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson led off the first inning with a line-drive single to center 
and Carney Lansford followed with a line-drive single to right, sending 
Henderson to third. Henderson scored when Dave Parker grounded into a double 
play and then McGwire flied deep to center to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The A's got at least one hit in each of the next three innings, but three more 
Angel double plays kept McCaskill in the game. He lasted five innings, yielding 
seven hits and three runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels got to Oakland starter Curt Young for three runs in the fourth 
inning with four consecutive singles and some smart baserunning by Brian 
Downing. With one out, Johnny Ray singled to center, Devon White singled to 
right and Wally Joyner drove in Ray with another single to right. Downing's 
single to right scored White to give the Angels a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then Lance Parrish hit a soft grounder to second baseman Tony Phillips. Downing 
stopped in front of Phillips and ran back toward first, forcing Phillips to 
throw to first for one out. Downing then broke for second and was out by 20 
feet, but he had bought enough time to allow Joyner to score the Angels' third 
run before the third out was recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's talking about Chili and Jack, but what about the baserunning of 
Brian Downing?" Rader asked. "That was as big a run as any in the game." 
</P>
<P>
The A's tied the score in the fifth, almost without the benefit of a hit. 
Phillips walked and Mike Gallego hit a drive to right-center. Right fielder 
Tony Armas appeared to catch the ball, but it popped loose and Gallego was 
credited with a double, the A's only extra-base hit of the game. The next two 
batters -- Rickey Henderson and Lansford -- hit sacrifice flies to center, 
tying the score, 3-3. 
</P>

Willie Fraser came on to pitch the sixth for the Angels and earned the victory 
to boost his record to 3-5. He retired six A's in a row before surrendering a 
leadoff single to Henderson in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Angels, who were swept in a three-game series here in late April, 
were trying hard to stay low-key about this particular victory. Rader brought 
home that point when asked what bearing this victory would have on today's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll show up," he said.

PADUA HILLS 'B' SERIES IS GRADE A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colleague Albert Goldberg once noted that judging an evening of new music can 
be a process of "separating the chaff from the chaff." It can be the same with 
new plays, especially experimental ones. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there was some chaff on Series "A" of this year's Padua Hills 
Playwrights' Festival at Cal State Northridge. Series "B," though, is almost 
all wheat. 
</P>
<P>
The only piece that doesn't make a strong impression is John Steppling's "The 
Theory of Miracles." That's because the author is still putting it together, 
trying to see if this speech works better here or there, and if more linkage is 
needed. Call it a prospectus for what could be an intriguing play. What draws 
people to a religious pageant in an age when God is supposed to be dead? 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Julie Hebert's "Almost Asleep" is a finished work. Hebert takes 
off from the same place that Joyce did in Molly Bloom's soliloquy: a woman 
drifting into sleep. But where Molly breathes with the tide, Hebert's Linda is 
harassed and fragmented. Her mind runs off every which way. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it takes three actresses to pin her down: Mary Forcade, Patricia 
Mattick and Tina Preston. They wear identical pale-orange pajamas that have a 
slightly institutional look. And the set (a storage area at the college's Art 
and Design Center) suggests a cell block. If Linda isn't literally under guard, 
she is certainly on guard. 
</P>
<P>
That's one of her problems. She/they move around the space in the twitchy way 
of her grasshopper mind. That can be comical. But Linda has a real quarrel with 
her life, and we don't dismiss her as a mere bundle of nerves. 
</P>
<P>
Nor -- once her story has come out -- do we see her as an emblematic "abused 
woman." She has been abused, but that's not the central fact of Linda. This 
remains beyond reach, except perhaps in sleep, which she almost achieves at the 
end: the sleep of regeneration, not of death. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Hebert (she directed the piece as well) leaves some room for 
mystery. "Almost Asleep" is neither a simplistic political statement nor a 
facile style exercise. Its business is to track a woman trying to find the 
thread of her life, and it does so memorably. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Martell's "Kindling" is an engaging play set in a part of Vermont that 
doesn't take kindly to Hollywood actors looking to get away from it all. The 
natives have enough troubles as it is. Without making archetypes of his 
Vermonters, Martell respects their dignity, and gives us a love story of sorts 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
This is performed in a field at Northridge. Put a camera on it, and you'd have 
a charming TV play, of the sort that the American networks haven't done for 
years, unfortunately. Martell was the director, and his cast is faultless -- 
Leonard Donato as the lightweight from Hollywood, and Molly Cleator, Rick Dean 
and Jim Haynie as the locals, who know what it is to earn a day's pay. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Irene Fornes is a regular at the Padua Hills Festival. Her "Oscar and 
Bertha" is classic Fornes -- batty, erotic, strangely beguiling. If Genet wrote 
comedies, they'd be like Fornes' pieces. 
</P>
<P>
In this one, we have a sister (Mary Forcade) and brother (Pamela Gordon) 
lusting after the same simple-minded maid (Molly Cleator), and it's 
characteristic that Fornes puts the brother in a wheelchair and has him played 
by a woman. In the kind of family she writes about, gender is beside the point; 
it's the rancor that matters. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow Fornes can make the appalling look amusing -- until you think about it. 
'Oscar and Bertha" needs trimming, but the play is there, and the company plays 
it like hilariously petulant fourth-graders. Again, the author directed -- 
something that playwrights aren't supposed to have the objectivity to do. Padua 
Hills founder-director Murray Mednick, a playwright himself, knows better. 
</P>
<P>
Series "B" plays Saturdays and Sundays at 7:30 p.m., Cal State Northridge Art 
and Design Center, off Halsted Street. Closes Aug. 6. Tickets $15-$32.

Aided by a mid-summer lull in major studio releases, Warners' two big guns 
controlled the box office for the third weekend in a row. "Lethal Weapon 2" 
brought down $13 million on 1,830 screens, down 24% from last week. "Batman," 
still playing on 2,201 screens, grossed $11.2 million. The dark knight is 
nearing the $200-million mark with a current total gross of $187.5 million. The 
box-office chase will heat up again Friday when Disney unleashes Tom Hanks and 
a 180-pound dog in the comedy "Turner and Hooch." In its second week of 
release, Columbia's "When Harry Met Sally . . ." expanded from 41 to 775 
screens, earning $8.8 million for the weekend high per-screen average of 
$11,415. 
</P>
<P>
* Hemdale's "Shag, the Movie" introduced South Carolina shag dancing, circa 
1960, to a 1989 audience. Despite favorable reviews, the independent film and 
its ensemble cast of young performers grossed just $2 million on 850 screens -- 
an average of $2,387 per screen.

"Les Miserables," which closed Sunday at the Shubert Theatre, broke the 
all-time box office record for a week's take at the theater in the final week 
of its run here. The $614,708 gross beats the show's own record-breaking figure 
of $610,287 reported last January. "Les Miz" had been at the Shubert since June 
1, 1988. ALEENE MacMINN

TV personality Cristina Ferrare and MCA TV have a new deal that calls for her 
to headline a new syndicated daily talk show that will be "different from any 
other on the market." "MCA TV has been pursuing Ms. Ferrare to do a national 
talk show for the past two years, so naturally we are elated by this 
arrangement," said Shelly Schwab, president of MCA TV. Ferrare's Uptown 
Productions is included in the pact, which also calls for her involvement in 
other areas of television syndication. Ferrare was host of KABC-TV's "A.M. Los 
Angeles" for five years and this week is guest hosting ABC's "Good Morning 
America." ALEENE MacMINN

PRISON VIDEOS THAT UNLOCK THE IMAGINATION

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
From 1986 to 1989, Gary Glassman was the artist in residence at a California 
men's prison where he taught video skills to inmates. Over those four years, 
Glassman worked with more than 600 men and women throughout the state prison 
system; the fruits of his labors can currently be seen at Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions in "Walking Smooth," a 53-minute compilation of 13 
videos Glassman completed in collaboration with prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
On view through Sunday, these modest tapes are as emotionally rich as they are 
technically spare. Employing video in a variety of ways -- as a form of 
therapy, a source of humor, a vehicle for poetry -- Glassman attempts to focus 
on the humanity of the inmates and to restore some of the dignity they've lost 
in the course of their ill-fated lives. On that score he succeeds admirably; 
most of the approximately 40 inmates we see here come off like gentle, rational 
beings cursed with incredibly bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the tapes lead one to forget the fact that most of these people 
probably did some pretty frightening things in order to end up in the prison 
video workshop, and one gets little sense of the volatility and violence that 
we know to be a part of prison life. Glassman addresses the darker side of his 
subject more directly in "Prisoners," a widely seen video he completed in 1986 
in collaboration with artist Jonathan Borofsky. In "Walking Smooth," however, 
he takes the user-friendly approach. 
</P>
<P>
To Glassman's credit, none of the 13 tapes on view are remotely like rock 
videos (the cliche of choice for short tapes), and several take a surprisingly 
fresh approach to the form. Unfortunately, it's never made clear who thought of 
what: Did Glassman conceive and direct the videos, or were the inmates given 
creative control of the tapes they appear in? Some information as to how the 
inmates felt about their participation in the video workshop, and how they 
perceive themselves in terms of their own creativity would add another 
dimension to this project. 
</P>
<P>
Those kvetches aside, Glassman brings an uncommonly insightful and empathetic 
eye to his subject. In the video-as-therapy department, "Big I Little You" 
depicts a conversation between two aspects of the same man (the part of him 
that feels like a failure vs. the part that feels like a success), while "Hal 
and Hal" finds an inmate taunting his own image on a video monitor. Two tapes 
structured in the form of short narratives -- "Walk This Way" and "Disrespect" 
-- allude to the survival of the fittest Darwinism that permeates prison life, 
while "Ticket to Hell" finds a female inmate staring into the camera and 
declaring with hardened resignation that she's hurt everyone who's ever come 
near her (this tape, which also includes an anti-drug warning, has been shown 
as a public service announcement). 
</P>
<P>
The most engaging pieces in the program include a tape of a dance workshop -- 
there's something inexplicably disarming about watching these fierce-looking 
men intently working on mastering dance steps -- and "Walking Smooth," a survey 
of various prison walking styles. This tape is fascinating, as is the prison 
slang that turns up throughout the program (to "burglarize the conversation" is 
a particularly hip bit of jive). 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, much of the program is profoundly melancholy. In "Stacy at 
the Sea," (from a series titled "Where I'd Like to Be"), an inmate speaks with 
longing and regret about his dream of spending a day at the beach with his 
daughter. An eloquent expression of the part of this man's soul that's intact, 
and the part of his life that he's lost, this simple tape finds Glassman 
achieving exactly what he set out to do; it establishes a common ground between 
a man in prison and the people outside who fear him.

WORDS, MUSIC AT SOCIETY BRUNCH

The Los Angeles Jazz Society offered a double-header of sorts Sunday, at the 
weekly brunch in the Hollywood Holiday Inn: words (provided by the society, 
announcing this year's award winners) and music (by the Cunninghams and the 
Marty Harris Trio). 
</P>
<P>
Saxophonist Bob Cooper, this year's main honoree, was on hand, as was Vi Redd, 
the educator, saxophonist and singer, who received the society's Lifetime 
Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Leach of Cal State Northridge was named Educator of the Year. One of his 
students, 25-year-old guitarist Steve Gregory, received the Shelly Manne 
Memorial New Talent Award. Southland-based Horace Silver was selected as this 
year's composer/arranger. 
</P>
<P>
The recipients will be honored at a Sept. 10 awards dinner and tribute at the 
Hyatt Regency Hotel. Information: (213) 469-6800. 
</P>
<P>
Don and Alicia Cunningham, the vocal duo, are a tall, striking couple who 
leaned toward the traditional in their choice of material. Alternating between 
lyrics and scat versions, they tackled Ellington, Basie, Harry (Sweets) Edison 
(who was in the room when they sang their version of his celebrated blues 
"Centerpiece"), and Charlie Parker, represented in vocalese treatments of 
"Yardbird Suite" and "Confirmation." Their version of "Lush Life" was a 
uniquely moving treatment of the 50-year-old Billy Strayhorn masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Don Cunningham, who doubles on alto sax now and then, also got into a 
high-spirited carnival groove playing congas on "Tristeza." 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Marty Harris led a sympathetic accompanying unit; Harris could hardly 
be blamed for the fact that the piano was sorely in need of tuning. John 
Leitham, the southpaw bassist, was his usual supple, swinging self; Mel Lee on 
drums completed the backup. Trumpeter Al Aarons added his horn for a couple of 
numbers.

GUITAR DEMIGODS TUNE UP AND ROCK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Presumably to capture an audience that is aging along with him, I.R.S. Records 
Svengali Miles Copeland has spent the last couple of years signing up seemingly 
every out-of-work demigod in the late-'60s/early-'70s guitar-hero pantheon. The 
package tour of his recruits Steve Hunter, Robbie Krieger and Wishbone Ash 
played Bogart's on Sunday and proved to be all tuned up with nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
While a Jeff Beck may have the style and personality to let his strings do the 
singing, Hunter (who has nimbly backed everyone from Lou Reed to Alice Cooper 
to Peter Gabriel) and ex-Door Krieger chiefly recalled the extended vamps and 
intros that precede the real star's entrance. Aided by Krieger, Hunter's 
distinctive, staggered-riff version of "Day Tripper" was the only standout to 
his set. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Krieger alternated between faceless fusion romps (briefly elevated 
by a humorous quote from "My Sharona" after ex-Knack drummer Bruce Gary's drum 
solo) and meandering versions of "The End" and other Doors tunes, displaying 
only hints of the intuition and originality that marked his playing on the 
originals. 
</P>
<P>
The British group Wishbone Ash, though rightly all but forgotten in rock 
history, was considerably more focused and enlivened as it ranged from such 
macrame-era anthems as "The King Will Come" to the current "Why Don't We," 
which benefited from its unabashed pop melodiousness. Guitarists Andy Powell 
and Ted Turner still turn in sharply honed solos and Allmans-like harmony 
lines, but their efforts seemed clinical, culminating in little emotional 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
The bill moves to the Ventura Theatre on Wednesday, the Wadsworth Theatre on 
Thursday (joined by the still-lively Spirit) and the Coach House on Saturday.

IT'S A BLUE MONDAY FOR RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
ALLEN, LEWIS FAIL TO SHOW AND HELLESTRAE BREAKS BONE IN LEFT LEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Raiders were braced for bad news Monday, they got more than they 
bargained for. Marcus Allen began his holdout, as did Bill Lewis, and just to 
tie a ribbon around the day, starting guard Dale Hellestrae broke a bone in his 
left leg. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who started at center last season, can play Hellestrae's position. In 
fact, he is one of the team's few experienced linemen who can, but he has 
already filed a grievance against the club and may sue. Al Davis doesn't laugh 
such challenges off, so if things haven't already gone too far for an amicable 
settlement, they're close. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Marcus . . . 
</P>
<P>
As is Lewis, Allen is on his option year, and thus under contract. Allen can't 
be reached for comment, and his agent, Ed Hookstratten, has not returned calls 
for a week. The Raiders, as usual, aren't talking, so this promises to be a 
quiet confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Allen was paid $1 million last season, would have to have been offered $1.1 
million for this one, and reportedly was offered a little more than that. 
</P>
<P>
However, Allen is said to have his eye on Bo Jackson's numbers: $840,000 in 
salary; a $100,000 reporting bonus and a $416,000 signing bonus (although 
$966,000 of that $1,356,000 total is deferred). 
</P>
<P>
Allen has played hurt for the last two seasons and moved over to fullback for 
Jackson without complaint. However, a certain rivalry is said to have begun 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was unhappy that he came out of games in goal-line situations. The 
Raiders may have been afraid he'd fumble. But after Allen, playing with a cast 
on his fractured left wrist, fumbled at the goal line in a late-season loss, 
the Raiders began taking him out and putting in Jackson. Allen reportedly 
didn't like it any more than Jackson did. 
</P>
<P>
There is also speculation that Allen, among others, is wishing for a deal that 
would send him to the Rams. That would reunite him with his coach at USC, John 
Robinson, and let him romp behind the strong Ram line. 
</P>
<P>
Without Allen, and of course, without Jackson, the Raiders are down two Heisman 
Trophy winners and short in general. The only veteran tailback is Vance 
Mueller. The only other halfbacks in camp are journeyman Curtis Adams and No. 8 
draft pick Derrick Gainer. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some inexperience there, no question about it," Coach Mike Shanahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've already expressed how I feel about Marcus. Now I've got to 
concentrate on the people who are here. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have a system, you'd love to have all your players in, but that's 
not always the way it goes in the NFL. That's part of the business. You have to 
practice with the people you have." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and his agent, Larry Muno, say that Lewis only lost his starting job 
because of his contract situation. Shanahan says he had already decided to 
switch Don Mosebar back to center in any case. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Lewis, at 6-7, 275, is big enough to play other line positions. He 
was voted the team's outstanding offensive lineman by his linemates last 
season. One preseason publication, the respected Don Heinrich's Pro Review, 
calls him "the best center in the division." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders protected Lewis on their 37-man list during the Plan B free-agency 
period, but did, apparently, make the decision to switch Mosebar to his 
position shortly thereafter. Mosebar was notified that he'd be going back to 
center several weeks before Lewis passed up mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
Allen didn't attend mini-camp, either. He and Lewis tried to use the weight 
room during the session, but Shanahan told them if they weren't going to 
practice, they'd have to leave the facility. 
</P>
<P>
They left and kept right on going. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders say Dale Hellestrae will be out six to 12 weeks. Hellestrae was one 
of the Raiders' Plan B free agents, a former No. 4 pick of the Buffalo Bills. 
He missed the 1985 season with a hip problem, was on injured reserve for eight 
games in '86 with a broken wrist, and on injured reserve for 12 games in '87 
with a broken thumb . . . Rookie Steve Wisniewski moves up to the No. 1 right 
guard. The left guard spot is being contested by last year's No. 10 pick, Newt 
Harrell, and utility man John Gesek.

JIM MURRAY: HE'S BEST, BUT LUCK IS WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only thing you knew for sure about the playoff for the 118th British Open 
was that Greg Norman wasn't going to win it. 
</P>
<P>
Norman's luck on a golf course would have to improve to be merely considered 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
Greg's only chance to win the Open was to do it in the clubhouse. If his 
13-under-par had held up, he would have won the cup sitting down. Once he had 
to go back out on the course with a club in his hands, the gods of golf, the 
most perverse deities in the whole pantheon, had him right where they wanted 
him -- in execution position, ripe for catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
They get everybody, those malevolent monsters. They got Ben Hogan at Olympic in 
1955, Arnold Palmer at the same club in 1966. They got Sam Snead at Spring Mill 
in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
But they dump all over Greg Norman, their favorite whipping boy. If I were 
Norman, I'd give up the game and go into something fair, like fighting oil-well 
fires. They're never going to let this man win anything important on a fairway 
anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
They torment him terribly. You remember how he was standing on the 18th green 
with the 1986 PGA in his back pocket? He was lying two, his opponent was lying 
two -- in a bunker. Well, Bob Tway chipped in over Greg's head, you might say, 
and in the background you could hear the ghostly cackle of the demons of golf. 
</P>
<P>
A guy chipping in -- in that situation -- is about as likely as a guy winning a 
lottery. But a year later, in the Masters, Norman was standing on a green, the 
11th, in a playoff against Larry Mize. Mize was far to the right of the green 
in a position where, you would have to say, he's lucky if he makes 4. Norman 
had a birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
So Mize chips right into the hole. For a 3 and the green coat. Naturally, 
Norman misses the birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
I would have to recommend you steer well clear of Norman if you're ever in a 
thunderstorm together. Don't get in the same lifeboat with him. As a matter of 
fact, don't share a cab -- or an elevator -- with him. If anyone says, "Room 
for one more," check to see if Greg is in there before you get in. Somebody up 
there has it in for him. 
</P>
<P>
All week long, I'd been congratulating myself that I didn't go to this year's 
British Open. It looked, till Sunday, as forgettable as your mother-in-law's 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, let me ask you, don't you hate it when you go to a movie where they've 
taken a classical story and spoofed it up? Like, "The Bride of Frankenstein" 
pokes fun at one of the great boo stories of all time. Cheapens it. 
</P>
<P>
I was never so mad in my life as when they turned "The Three Musketeers" into a 
vehicle for the Ritz Brothers. Or where the werewolf of London turns out to be 
Don Knotts. King Kong is a musical. Godzilla stops and does shtick in the 
Catskills. 
</P>
<P>
Well, that's the way I felt about this British Open. It was just another damn 
spoof. British Opens are supposed to be like Boris Karloff, Jack the Ripper. 
Frankenstein. Terrifying. Halls of Horror. Eighteen holes of silent screaming. 
</P>
<P>
Gales are supposed to sweep across them. Rain is supposed to slant in sideways. 
Winds are supposed to rake the fairways, bend the pins. Sand is supposed to 
blow in your eyes. 
</P>
<P>
It's not supposed to be a walk in the park, a day at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
It was this year. You would have sworn you were looking at a member-guest 
four-ball in Palm Springs. The sun beat down, the rough hadn't grown. There was 
no breeze. Boris Karloff was wearing a dress. Bela Lugosi drank milk. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't bear to watch. What fun was this? The golfers were in their shirt 
sleeves and not bundled up like sailors on the Murmansk run in the North 
Atlantic. Their teeth weren't even chattering, their lips weren't blue. I half 
expected to see the Ritz Brothers on the tee. 
</P>
<P>
All those 64s and 65s and 67s were getting to me. It wasn't par, it was parody. 
</P>
<P>
Then they had the first four-hole playoff in the history of this venerable 
sporting event, which began when Lincoln was President. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, things were looking up. It was something new in golf. We have had 
four-hole playoffs in this country, but that's because no one got eliminated on 
Nos. 1, 2 or 3. 
</P>
<P>
I decided to watch it to see where Greg Norman would get it in the neck. I knew 
it wouldn't be the first hole. The gods like to tease him more than that. He 
birdied the first hole. If it had been a true sudden-death, he'd be British 
Open champion today. 
</P>
<P>
But I knew that wasn't to be. And it wasn't. When Norman came to the last hole, 
I knew that golf's version of the Titanic was going to go looking for the 
iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch this!" I told myself as he lined up to the right of the tee. "Here comes 
the crash and burn." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough. Greg hit the best drive of the day, a long, screaming tee shot 
right in the middle of the fairway. Only it went into one of those little pot 
bunkers that Jack Nicklaus had just said "don't come into play." Jack had meant 
that they were too far out for anyone to reach. Super Greg reached one. And got 
penalized for it. They got him again. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Bolt used to greet undeserved misfortune by looking up at the sky when 
these things happened and shake his fist and shout, "Me again, huh, God?" But 
Greg is the guy who really goes around with this little black cloud over his 
head. Greg Btfsplk. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia only thinks he won the 1989 British Open. We who are longtime 
observers of the runaway perversity of this game know better. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia was the surest thing since Man o' War. Greg Norman? He shouldn't 
have bothered to tee it up. They were out to get him. Again. 
</P>
<P>
The only way Greg is ever going to win one of these things is in a mask and 
under an assumed name. The minute the gods see that white hair, and white 
teeth, and sliding tee shot, they start sticking pins in their Greg Norman 
dolls. 
</P>
<P>
Something about him just ticks them off. Maybe they're like me. They just 
resent the hell out of a guy who shoots a 64 in the last round of the British 
Open. That can get to you, all right.

NBA CHAMPIONSHIP LEAVES PISTON COACH CHUCK DALY WITH NO TIME TO REST; 
</P>
<P>
PISTONS' VICTORY LEAVES DALY WITH NO TIME TO REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The off-season has come to Chuck Daly in the form of a hurricane, carrying him 
about the world in a whirlwind fashion that he might have imagined but could 
not have prepared for. The body is looking for a 33-r.p.m. weekend sometime, 
but the schedule insists on nothing short of 78. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-forward life of a coach who has recently won the National Basketball 
Assn. title dictates such a disposition, all that to-the-victor-goes-the-spoils 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Daly has always enjoyed the trappings of success, having had commercials and 
weekly televisions shows in Detroit, and accepting requests for appearances on 
the rubber-chicken circuit long before the Pistons swept the Lakers six weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
But now, he's feeling somewhat trapped by success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more tired now than I was during the regular season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And he wasn't kidding. The thought of a weekend to himself is as remote as the 
possibility of Daly's buying his suits off the rack. 
</P>
<P>
Daly says he hasn't had a day off since the Forum clock hit 0:00 on June 13 and 
the Pistons charged into the locker room for their champagne shower. 
</P>
<P>
True, sometimes the tasks have not been any harder than sitting for so long 
(the victory parade through Detroit and subsequent celebration in suburban 
Auburn Hills, Mich.) and standing for so long (waiting to meet the President at 
the White House), but this is supposed to be vacation time. Time with the 
family. Time to get away from basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Daly has been to Spain for a clinic; to Atlanta to help roast Hawk 
Coach Mike Fratello; to northwestern Pennsylvania for a basketball camp; to 
Philadelphia to help roast Billy Cunningham, part owner of the Miami Heat; back 
to northwestern Pennsylvania and the camp; to Bill Laimbeer's charity golf 
tournament in Michigan; to Pittsburgh to speak at a high school all-star camp; 
to La Jolla for the Pistons' free agent/rookie camp. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's in Los Angeles for summer league games at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found that until you have been on national TV, in prime time, you can 
never understand all the stuff about celebrity status in terms of recognition," 
said Daly, who has more commitments ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"It can all become a bit freakish. You kind of know what movie stars -- 
although I'm certainly not putting myself in their category -- go through with 
people always coming up to them. Everyday life changes. I go to Mass and all 
the kids stare at you. Things like that take some getting used to." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, if it so awful, 26 other NBA coaches would volunteer to take over 
for him next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite honestly, I think he's enjoying every moment," said Dick Versace, Daly's 
assistant for 2 1/2 seasons before becoming coach of the Indiana Pacers in 
January. "At times, I'm sure he gets exhausted, but he's such a naturally 
self-effacing person it's hard to say no when people ask him to come. He wants 
to pay them back for all the help they've been to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll have gone to about five different camps to speak before the 
summer is over. He wants to go back and show he's no different toward them 
after winning an NBA title than when he was coaching at Penn or an assistant at 
Duke." 
</P>
<P>
Daly, who will begin his seventh season with the Pistons in the fall, doesn't 
deny enjoying the spotlight. But his personality won't allow him to make it a 
perfect time. Knowing that Rick Mahorn won't be there when camp opens in 
October has, at least slightly, dampened his enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely took an edge off (winning the title)," Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons lost Mahorn, a starting forward, to the Minnesota Timberwolves in 
the expansion draft, a quick change from winner to loser made all the more 
biting by the timing. The announcement that Mahorn had become a former Bad Boy 
was made on the day of the victory parade. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Jack McCloskey was so hoping to work out a deal that day, to 
make sure neither expansion team selected Mahorn, that he rode with a portable 
phone in the car. 
</P>
<P>
No such trade ever was put together, though, and the Pistons went from the 
parade to another celebration at the Palace of Auburn Hills, where the team 
plays its home games. Afterward, McCloskey, Daly and assistant coaches Brendan 
Malone and Brendan Suhr met in the locker room before breaking the news to the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen four adults so devastated about something in sports," Daly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That is probably his most vivid memory of the hectic weeks since the NBA finals 
started. Not the sweep of the defending champions, not the trip to the White 
House, not the star treatment at church. 
</P>
<P>
Daly is enjoying this special time, all right. Just not as much as he might. He 
has achieved the highest goal in the business, and it feels a little, well, 
anticlimactic. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's heresy, but maybe everything would have been more meaningful last 
year, because it would have been a surprise," he said. "At least more of a 
surprise because we were in position to win it in the seven-game series. This 
year, we were one of the favorites, so everyone kind of expected us to win." 
</P>
<P>
Daly paused and searched for a better explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "Maybe you work so hard to get somewhere and it just 
takes some time to appreciate it. . . . Most of all, though, I like the term 
world champion. That does give me a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
Friends aren't too concerned if the feelings appear to come off somewhat dull. 
That's just Daly, who for all his qualities as an affable and very likable 
person has a way of working backward. Even at a time like this, he'll look at 
the bad before getting on with the good. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I said, I think he is enjoying the time," Versace said. "But his manner 
is, 'Maybe I should start examining what went wrong.' Ricky's not there 
anymore, so (Daly) is thinking about that a lot right now, about how they won't 
be together next season."

Daly is already looking at 1989-90 -- the good and the bad. That's why he is at 
the summer league, to look at players. But part of the preparation to defend 
the NBA title includes, at last, some vacation in August and September. Burnout 
is a concern, after all. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to next season because it'll be a chance for me to slow 
down," he said, smiling but obviously not kidding.

HIT BATTER ALMOST SENDS DODGER LOSS OUT OF HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Dodger pitcher Tim Crews, who had hit one batter since 1987, said it was a 
fastball that slipped. The Pittsburgh Pirates saw it as intent to harm. 
</P>
<P>
The only one not offering an opinion on the pitch was Pittsburgh's Gary Redus. 
He was carried from home plate on a stretcher in the seventh inning Monday 
night, his left eye bloodied and swollen by a 90-m.p.h. fastball from Crews. 
</P>
<P>
The pitch caused a bench-clearing incident, an ejection and a showboat home run 
trot one inning later. Occurring in the final game of the season series between 
these teams, the pitch caused enough bad blood to last all winter. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers eventually suffered a forgettable 7-4 loss that the Pirates say 
they will long remember. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pittsburgh center fielder Andy Van Slyke: "The Dodgers were . . ., and I 
told them they were . . .; Redus looked worse than any of Mike Tyson's 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dodger Mickey Hatcher: "Even though we didn't try to hit him, it doesn't 
matter. There is going to be a scar. Now we have to worry about retaliation. 
It's a bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates were leading at the time, 6-2, before 19,957 at Three Rivers 
Stadium. R.J. Reynolds drew a two-out walk, and then stole second and third 
bases on consecutive Crews' pitches to Redus. 
</P>
<P>
With a 1-and-1 count, Crews' next pitch headed at Redus' head. Redus had an 
instant to put up his left wrist, and the ball apparently glanced off the 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
But the ball landed directly on Redus' eye. He crumpled by the right side of 
the plate, grabbing his face as he hit the ground. Trainers rushed to the plate 
while the Pirates' players rushed onto the field. They were led by Van Slyke, 
who ran directly at Crews, stopped a few inches away, and began screaming at 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him it was bull to try to hit him, and he said he didn't do it, and I 
said that he was full of bull," Van Slyke said. "He hit him because we were 
stealing bases, he thought we were showing him up. But as this team has proven, 
we have lost a lot of four-run leads. We were just trying to score runs." 
</P>
<P>
Redus was rushed to Allegheny General Hospital, where late Monday he was listed 
in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
Van Slyke never touched Crews. The players pulled each other aside in bearhugs, 
but there was no brawl. 
</P>
<P>
Said Crews: "After I hit him (Redus), I don't know what happened. I don't know 
what Van Slyke said. I just know, hitting him was the furthest thing from my 
mind. And to hit somebody in the head, that's kind of scary." 
</P>
<P>
After the field was cleared, Pirate starter Bob Walk began yelling at Crews 
from the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"He was yelling, 'I'll take care of it next inning,' " first base umpire Gerry 
Davis said. "I told Leyland (Pirate Manager Jim) to take care of him, and he 
said he would, but then Walk started yelling at Crews again, telling him he was 
going to get even." 
</P>
<P>
So Davis ejected Walk. And that only made the Pirates madder, and it showed in 
the eighth inning. With two out, and Crews still pitching, Barry Bonds drove a 
ball into the left-field seats for his 14th homer. He could have walked around 
the bases in the time it took him to complete his home run trot. 
</P>
<P>
When he crossed the plate, he glared at Crews and hurled his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
"They are lucky I didn't go around slower," Bonds said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
While sitting in front of his locker, Bonds later noticed a reporter from Los 
Angeles and shouted: "Get out of here. Nobody from L.A. should be in here. Go 
talk to your own damn players." 
</P>
<P>
Both Lasorda and Crews acted befuddled by the incident. They said they 
understood why the Pirates would try to pad their lead by stealing bases, and 
pointed to the game's near dramatic finish as evidence. The Dodgers ended the 
ninth inning with runners on first and second and Kal Daniels flying out to 
Bonds on a running catch. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would we be upset that they were stealing, what was the score?" Lasorda 
asked. "They didn't have the game in the bag, Reynolds had to score. I bet my 
lungs that my kid was not trying to hit him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Crews: "They had to steal bases, I understood that. I didn't even think 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said that he didn't even notice Bonds' slow trot -- "What do I care how 
he runs the bases? Jimmy Piersall ran them backward, didn't he? I don't worry 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
But Lasorda warned that Walk was fortunate he didn't try to get even. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been the biggest mistake of his life if he had," Lasorda said. 
"And if he did, he better pick on the right guy." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing certain was that the disagreement between the teams is not over. 
</P>
<P>
"Next time we play them, even if it is next year, we're going to have to 
worry," Hatcher said. "We all have families, we all have careers, and that's 
going to make it hard. Unfortunately, these things just do not die." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dodger starter Mike Morgan failed to get past the fifth inning for a third 
consecutive start. He allowed three Pirate runs in the first inning on two 
singles, two walks and a sacrifice fly. He allowed two more runs in the fifth 
on two singles and a double. Then he was gone, having allowed five runs on 
seven hits in 4 1/3 innings. In his last three starts, the former National 
League ERA leader is 0-3 with a 10.95 ERA. Overall he is 6-11 with a 2.61 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I pitched in the first half of the season, I never thought I would hit 
a slump," Morgan said. "I knew I wouldn't cruise, but I didn't expect this. I 
don't know if I'm squeezing the ball or aiming the ball or what." Pitching 
coach Ron Perranoski thinks Morgan should just slow down and relax. "In the 
first inning he was just getting the ball and throwing it, catch and throw, 
catch and throw," Perranoski said. "I told him to start concentrating and when 
he did, it seemed to work. He needs to take his time." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 7-2 in the ninth, the Dodgers began a comeback, breaking Pirate 
reliever Bill Landrum's 30 2/3-inning scoreless streak in the process. Mike 
Scioscia doubled, Jeff Hamilton doubled, pinch-hitter Billy Bean walked, 
pinch-hitter Franklin Stubbs doubled and Willie Randolph walked to produce two 
runs and put runners on first and second for Kal Daniels, who earlier had a 
two-run double. Daniels drove the ball deep into the left-field corner, but 
Barry Bonds grabbed it as he crossed the foul line for the game's final out. . 
. . The Dodgers split this six-game series with the Pirates but won the season 
series, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Looking like a batboy but sounding like a veteran, Santa Ana's Bean joined the 
Dodgers Monday -- all 5 feet 11, 185 pounds of him. He was recalled from 
triple-A Albuquerque only a week after he was acquired from triple-A Toledo in 
a minor league trade with the Detroit organization. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Bean has come to the major leagues because of an injury 
to Kirk Gibson. In 1987, Bean made his big league debut for Detroit by going 
four for six with two doubles on April 25 against Kansas City. At that time, 
Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson called Bean a future great player. Bean was sent 
back to the minor leagues 25 games later. He played only 10 big league games 
last season. He left the Tiger organization with a .247 average with no homers 
and four RBIs in 36 games. "Looking back, as much as those things Sparky said 
helped me, they also hurt me," Bean said. "But he did give me a chance." Bean 
says he's ready for a new start where the expectations aren't quite so high. 
Look for him to help out with late-inning defense -- he has yet to make a major 
league error -- and as a part-time starter. Bean is one of the top all-time 
hitters at Loyola Marymount. He was drafted in the fourth round by the Tigers 
when he graduated in June, 1986.

LEONARD-DURAN BOUT IS EXPECTED TO BE ANNOUNCED WEDNESDAY

A third fight between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran will be announced 
formally at a news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The date and site were not known Monday, but the boxers probably will meet in 
Las Vegas Nov. 2 or in Atlantic City, N.J., Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard wants another fight, and Duran's the guy," said a spokesman Monday for 
Top Rank, promoter Bob Arum's firm. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, 33, and Duran, 38, last met in two 1980 fights, when both were 
welterweights. On June 20, 1980, Duran won a decision over Leonard in Montreal, 
then quit in the eighth round in the famous "No mas" rematch in New Orleans, 
Nov. 25, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Recent speculation was that Leonard's next fight would be against Thomas 
Hearns, who fought a 12-round draw with Leonard June 12 at Las Vegas. Leonard 
will go into Leonard-Duran III as the WBC's super-middleweight champion, his 
fifth title. Duran became a four-time champion when he won the WBC middleweight 
title on a 12-round split decision over Iran Barkley Feb. 24 at Atlantic City.

A clothes manufacturing firm owned by former tennis star Bjorn Borg is 
apparently on the verge of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
After rejecting an offer for new financing because he feared losing control of 
the company, Borg was negotiating other financing Monday to keep his business 
afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Borg turned down a $4.6-million offer to buy into Bjorn Borg Enterprises Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Borg, who won five consecutive Wimbledon titles and six French Open crowns, was 
estimated to have earned $75 million in prizes and endorsements when he retired 
from professional tennis in 1983. On his 1986 tax return, Borg stated his 
personal wealth at nearly $8 million.

Transportation problems in Montreal kept the Cincinnati Reds from playing the 
annual Hall of Fame game Monday against the Boston Red Sox at Doubleday Field. 
</P>
<P>
The game was scheduled to start at 2 p.m. (EDT), but at that time the Reds were 
still in Montreal, where they lost four consecutive games to the Expos over the 
weekend to extend their losing streak to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
A Hall of Fame official said the Reds had bus problems and then difficulty 
chartering a plane for the trip to central New York. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Bart Giamatti made the announcement to a crowd of about 9,000, who 
didn't appear too disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox arrived on time and took batting practice and played an intrasquad 
game, also using players from Elmira of the New York State-Penn League. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Reds made it, Manager Pete Rose planned to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who is facing allegations that he bet on baseball games, didn't want to 
take any of the spotlight away from former teammate Johnny Bench, who was 
inducted Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds play the San Diego Padres at home tonight at 7:30.

GIANTS WIN ON 33RD HR BY MITCHELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A two-run homer by Kevin Mitchell spoiled John Smoltz's three-hitter as the San 
Francisco Giants beat the Atlanta Braves, 2-0, in Atlanta Monday night to give 
Rick Reuschel his 13th victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's homer in the fourth inning, his 33rd, came against Smoltz (11-7), 
who struck out a career-high 10. The loss was Atlanta's fifth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
With his 33rd homer in his 94th game, Mitchell is one game ahead of Babe Ruth's 
60 home-run pace of 1927. Roger Maris, who hit 61 homers in 1961, hit No. 33 in 
the 82nd game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel (13-4) pitched five innings but left after suffering a groin pull that 
has hampered him recently. He escaped a bases-loaded, no-out threat in the 
fourth, retiring Darrell Evans on a flyball, Andres Thomas on a popup and Jeff 
Treadway on a flyout. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel gave up five hits and walked two with no strikeouts. Steve Bedrosian, 
the fourth San Francisco pitcher, got the last two outs for his 14th save. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who also increased his major league-leading RBI total to 87, hit an 
0-and-2 pitch over the fence in left-center to also score Earnest Riles, who 
had hit a single. 
</P>
<P>
The only other baserunner against Smoltz was Matt Williams, playing his first 
game since being recalled from Phoenix of the Pacific Coast League. Williams 
had a single in the second, but Smoltz struck out the side. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Two errors by the Phillies and a game-winning 
single in the 12th inning by Tim Wallach helped the Expos win at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Galarraga hit a one-out single off Greg Harris (1-2) and made it to 
second base when Tom Herr dropped the throw from center fielder Len Dykstra. 
Tim Raines was walked intentionally and Hubie Brooks reached on an error by 
Harris before Wallach singled to left to extend both Montreal's winning streak 
and Philadelphia's losing streak to four games. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hayes had tied the score with his 15th homer, leading off the ninth against 
Tim Burke. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos, who have hit 10 home runs in their last three games, got solo homers 
from Rex Hudler and Brooks off starter Dennis Cook. Hudler hit his sixth in the 
first inning and Brooks his eighth to give the Expos a 3-2 lead in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Andy McGaffigan (3-4) pitched one inning for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, St. Louis 2 -- Winning pitcher Mike Bielecki had two key bunts, 
including a fifth-inning suicide squeeze that put Chicago ahead to stay, as the 
Cubs won at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended the Cardinals' four-game winning streak and extended Chicago's 
to three. 
</P>
<P>
With an infield hit in the fourth, St. Louis' Jose Oquendo extended the longest 
hitting streak in the majors this season to 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
Bielecki (10-5) gave up four hits, struck out six and walked two in seven 
innings. He retired 11 in a row before being relieved. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Williams pitched the final 1 1/3 innings for his 24th save in 31 
opportunities.

A'S CAN ONLY WATCH AS THE ANGELS' HARVEY UNLEASHES HIS FORKBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

OAKLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the best situation the 44,548 fans in the Oakland Coliseum could have 
hoped for Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco was at bat. Their team trailed the Angels by just a run, 5-4, in 
the bottom of the ninth inning. And Bryan Harvey, the Angels' often brilliant, 
but lately erratic relief pitcher, was on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco had missed 88 games, the entire first half of the season, with an 
injured left wrist. But he was now in sound shape. After all, he came into the 
game having hit home runs in three consecutive games and had five in his first 
nine since returning to the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Harvey appeared to be in yet another shaky mode. His first three 
pitches to Canseco sailed wide. This was shades of a recent stretch where 
Harvey walked at least one batter in eight of nine outings. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey's long, slow strolls around the mound seemed to signal a sense of 
impending doom for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
They had forged ahead on solo home runs by Chili Davis in the seventh and Jack 
Howell in the eighth. They had seen their 5-3 lead cut to 5-4 on an RBI single 
by Mark McGwire in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
And now the Angels were counting on Harvey, who had come in to get the final 
out in the eighth, to put the clamps on Oakland's hitters in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey battled back, to force a three-two count. And he froze Canseco with a 
wicked forkball that danced inside. Strike three. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco looked at six Harvey pitches without swinging and there was one out. 
</P>
<P>
But Harvey was not out of trouble yet. Terry Steinbach, hitting .317, stepped 
up next. And Harvey walked him on four pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Tony Phillips and Harvey struck out the second baseman with a 
forkball for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa then sent Ron Hassey up to pinch-hit for Mike 
Gallego. It was an interesting move because Gallego had a single and a double 
that went in-and-out of right fielder Tony Armas' glove, the A's only 
extra-base hit. 
</P>
<P>
The right-handed Harvey struck out Hassey with yet another forkball. Like the 
others, Hassey took it. Unlike the others, Hassey actually swung at a pitch, 
managing to foul two off. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Harvey faced four batters and got three strikeouts. Three 
called-looking strikeouts. And all with the forkball, a tough pitch to get over 
for a strike as Harvey well knows.

"It was the best forkball I had all season right there," Harvey said. "It was 
working well." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey picked up his 13th save of the season, preserving a 5-4 victory in Game 
1 of an important three-game series with Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
With his other pitches floating out of the strike zone, Harvey and catcher 
Lance Parrish stuck with the forkball. 
</P>
<P>
They were counting on Canseco to look for a fastball with a three-two count. 
</P>
<P>
"I tricked him a little bit and luckily it worked," Harvey said. "With a guy 
like Canseco, he's looking for a fastball. He can change the game with one 
swing of the bat." 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, I felt comfortable with the forkball," Harvey said. "I was keeping it 
down and throwing it for strikes." 
</P>
<P>
The other pitches weren't working, so why not stick with the forkball? 
</P>

"Everything's not going to be perfect," Manager Doug Rader said. "Bryan got the 
four outs we needed in the ninth (including the last out in the eighth). So he 
got three balls on a few people and walked a guy. That's just Bryan."

House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said a pay increase for members of 
Congress should be included in the pay package President Bush has proposed for 
federal judges and top executive branch officials. Speaking at the National 
Press Club, Foley said the "traditional linkage" between executive and 
legislative branch pay "should not be broken." An attempt earlier this year to 
pass a 50% pay increase for Congress and other top officials was shelved 
because of public protest. Bush since has proposed raises of up to 25% for 
judges and executive branch officials. Bush made no proposal for a 
congressional pay raise, but Foley said he does not think the President opposes 
an increase. Lawmakers currently earn $89,500 a year.

Eighty-two Greek-Cypriot women jailed for their part in protests that have 
jeopardized Cyprus unification talks were freed by the Turkish breakaway state 
of Northern Cyprus. They boarded buses to return to Greek Cypriot territory, 
separated from the Turkish area by a U.N. buffer zone. However, 10 men, 
including a Greek Orthodox bishop, were still in jail after refusing to pay 
fines of up to $220. The protesters were among more than 100 people ordered 
jailed by a Turkish-Cypriot court after staging a buffer zone demonstration 
last week to mark the 15th anniversary of Turkey's invasion of Cyprus.

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appointed new foreign and defense 
secretaries, fired two other Cabinet ministers and switched several more in the 
biggest government shake-up since she won power in 1979. Thatcher named John 
Major, 46, little-known chief secretary to the Treasury, the No. 2 financial 
post, as the new foreign secretary to replace Geoffrey Howe. Howe was moved to 
a vacant post as deputy prime minister and the governing Conservative Party's 
leader in the House of Commons. Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King was named 
defense secretary, replacing George Younger, who resigned. Fired were Transport 
Secretary Paul Channon and Social Services Secretary John Moore. The Cabinet 
reshuffle is designed to halt the government's slide in popularity.

The Israeli government approved a $140-million emergency spending package to 
counter economic stagnation and the worst unemployment in 20 years. Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Cabinet, meeting in special session, decided that the 
extra funds will be spent mainly on labor-intensive projects and investment in 
industry. Almost 30% of the money will be spent building new roads or upgrading 
existing routes. The Israeli economy has shown no growth in 1989.

After Columbus Day, the Names Project will scale back its national display of 
quilts that serves as a personal memorial to those who have died of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome, a spokesman for the organization said. "We will be 
going into senior citizen centers, classrooms and to people at risk but who 
have yet to come to terms with AIDS, and let the quilt do what it does, which 
is to reach people on a personal level," said Names Project spokesman Dan 
Sauro. Cleve Jones, a gay political activist in San Francisco, said the cost of 
mounting the full display of quilts since October, 1987, has become 
prohibitive. It will cost about $165,000 to transport and display the 
approximately 12,000 quilts Oct. 6-8 in Washington on 25 acres on the south 
side of the White House.

A New York pharmaceutical company recalled a generic anti-hypertensive drug 
because it said company employees misrepresented samples of the drug submitted 
for government inspection. Par Pharmaceutical Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y., also 
said it suspended sales of two other government-approved drugs while 
investigations into them continue. The recall of Par's generic version of the 
high-blood-pressure drug Maxzide marks the second time this summer a drug 
company has informed the Food and Drug Administration it had misrepresented its 
product to the agency. In each case, the companies marketed formulations of 
their product that were different than those approved by the FDA.

Sixty-nine opposition members of India's lower house of Parliament resigned to 
protest alleged corruption in the government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. 
Although it was earlier reported that all 106 opposition members had quit, 37 
lawmakers who were not at the legislative session only indicated plans to quit 
the 544-seat house. The action followed a week of clashes over an official 
auditor's report criticizing the Congress-I party government over a 
$1.4-billion arms deal with the Swedish company Bofors.

FUELING CHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
BALKING MOTORISTS ARE DRIVING GASOLINE PRICES DOWN, BUCKING TRENDS EARLIER THIS 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorists have voted with their gas pedals against higher pump prices this 
summer by driving less and opting for cheaper, lower grades of gasoline, a 
reversal of trends earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, inventories of gasoline grew unexpectedly in mid-July as refiners 
continued to produce gasoline at the highest rates in 11 years, and analysts 
now foresee prices continuing to slip by a penny or two a gallon as they have 
since June. 
</P>
<P>
The flat demand erases any lingering fears that refineries would fail to keep 
up with demand or that motorists would see the return of gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
"You had gasoline prices move up strongly prior to the driving season, and some 
people may have decided not to take that long drive," said M. Craig Schwerdt, 
an industry analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of the year, gasoline consumption averaged 7.26 million 
barrels a day, about 2,000 barrels less than levels in the like period a year 
ago, according to figures from the American Petroleum Institute, the oil 
industry's main trade group. 
</P>
<P>
From April to June, higher prices may have cut usage by as much as 100,000 
barrels per day, reported the authoritative Petroleum Intelligence Weekly 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, drivers are buying lower-octane gasoline, "and that's one way of 
responding to price," said Tom Burns, manager of the economics staff at Chevron 
USA. 
</P>
<P>
The national weighted average price of all grades of gasoline fell to 115.66 
cents per gallon in the period ended July 21, from 116.76 cents per gallon on 
July 7, according to the Lundberg Survey of 12,000 gasoline stations. That 
compares to a peak of 118.43 cents on May 19, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the retail price of regular unleaded gasoline at self-service 
pumps -- the most popular grade -- fell to 106.80 cents per gallon on July 21 
from 109.64 cents per gallon on July 7, the Lundberg Survey showed. That 
compares to a peak price of 114.24 cents per gallon on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
With continuing high production rates -- more then 90% overall -- the trends 
may have contributed to the increase in total inventories of gasoline in the 
week ending July 14. Stocks were up 5.2 million barrels, to 222.8 million 
barrels, API reported. 
</P>
<P>
The one-week spurt in stocks doesn't necessarily augur excessive inventories in 
the coming weeks. But production has run at unusually high rates, in part to 
offset an expected loss of capacity under new federal vapor regulations. In 
addition, slackened demand for high-octane products meant that refiners could 
produce more gas overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department reported that average daily production of gasoline peaked 
at 7.6 million barrels per day during the week ended June 30, which was the 
highest level since December, 1978. The average rate of production also peaked 
that week at 91.4%, the highest rate since August, 1978, the department 
reported.

KARCHER, FAMILY TO PAY $664,000 TO SETTLE INSIDER TRADING LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl N. Karcher, founder of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, and six of his 
relatives agreed Monday to settle civil charges of insider trading by paying a 
total of $664,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The case is settled. Carl just wanted to get it behind him for the benefit of 
his family and children," said Thomas Holliday, Karcher's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Under the consent agreement, Karcher and his family members neither admitted 
nor denied the charges made against them. Combined with a proposed pact with 
company accounting director Alvin DeShano, the settlement ends a civil lawsuit 
filed 15 months ago by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC had 
alleged that Karcher and others supplied insider information to help his 
relatives avoid stock market losses of at least $310,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Founder to Pay $332,000 
</P>
<P>
An attempt last May to settle the SEC suit fell apart when federal prosecutors 
refused to rule out the possibility of criminal prosecution. Attorneys close to 
the case said the family received that guarantee in the settlement announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement requires Karcher, 72-year-old founder and chief executive of 
Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises, to pay a fine of $332,000, the amount 
his relatives saved by selling company stock after he allegedly told them that 
the firm was about to report a dramatic drop in earnings. The accord also 
requires the six relatives to pay, overall, another $332,000 to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano, accounting director of Karcher Enterprises, has also tentatively 
agreed to pay $12,396, the amount he saved by selling his company stock, plus a 
penalty of $12,396. Unlike the Karcher family agreement, the DeShano pact has 
not been approved by the SEC in Washington, but such approval is expected soon, 
sources close to the case said. Under the agreement, DeShano would not admit or 
deny wrongdoing but would agree not to violate securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 defendants sued last year for insider trading, only DeShano was 
criminally charged. After a five-day trial, a Los Angeles jury in June found 
that DeShano was not guilty of a single count of securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Although all the defendants agreed to settle the SEC action without admitting 
or denying the accusations, all agreed to court orders forbidding them from 
violating insider trading laws. 
</P>
<P>
General terms of the settlement with the Karcher family were approved several 
weeks ago by the SEC in Washington, SEC trial counsel John Koutsos said. Final 
details were completed Monday when attorneys met for an hourlong, closed-door 
session with U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
By settling the case, Karcher chose to avoid both the emotional and financial 
costs of a trial, his lawyer said. "We had a winnable case," Holliday said. 
"But the monetary cost, in terms of lawyers and personal impact on the family, 
far outweighed the desire to win" at trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Costs Cited 
</P>
<P>
Holliday estimated that legal costs could have approached $1 million for all 
seven Karcher family defendants. In addition to Carl Karcher they are: his 
daughter Catherine Karcher Everly and her husband, Daniel Everly; daughter 
Margaret J. LaVecke; daughter Barbara Karcher Wall; son Jerome Karcher, and a 
son-in-law, Donald E. Fergus Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement hands the government "as much relief as we would have gotten had 
we won the entire case after a trial," Koutsos said. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against the other defendants named in the SEC complaint were resolved 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Judge Rafeedie decided that Karcher's son, Carl Leo Karcher, had 
illegally traded his stock and fined him $10,500. In April, the judge dropped 
Margaret Karcher, the company founder's wife, from the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Six other family members, including company President Donald Karcher, settled 
with the SEC in February by agreeing to pay $187,560. That settlement included 
an agreement from the U.S. Attorney's Office that criminal charges would not be 
brought against those who settled, according to lawyers involved in the case.

LONG FIGHT RESOLVED; 
</P>
<P>
FEUDING COUPLE WORK OUT PLAN FOR FUTURE OF ESPRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The estranged husband and wife team that owns Esprit de Corp. -- known for its 
line of trendy womens' apparel and its former egalitarian corporate culture -- 
on Monday announced a plan aimed at ending the couple's long and bitter feud 
over control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
The plan could result in the eventual sale of the San Francisco-based fashion 
and retailing firm founded by Doug and Susie Tompkins. The Tompkinses, who 
filed for divorce earlier this year, each have fought to become the sole owner 
of Esprit. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Doug Tompkins will have the option to buy out Susie Tompkins' 
50% interest in the business. If Doug Tompkins fails to purchase his wife's 50% 
stake in 120 days, his half of the company as well as hers will be put up for 
sale at auction, the company said. At that time, Susie Tompkins or anyone else 
could bid for the entire company. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with this major step forward in resolving the ownership of the 
company," said Esprit President Corrado Federico in a prepared statement. "This 
will allow us to continue our programs that have increased the company's 
profitability and financial strength." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Federico nor the Tompkinses were available for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's agreement is the latest chapter in the stormy personal and business 
relationship between the Tompkinses, who have been estranged for several years. 
</P>
<P>
The Tompkinses began selling Esprit clothing in the late 1960s through 
catalogues mailed to affluent households. Susie Tompkins was responsible for 
designing the company's line of colorful and loose-fitting clothing. Her 
husband was responsible for the marketing and business operations. By 1987, 
profits reportedly had grown to $80 million on sales of $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tensions Grew 
</P>
<P>
Esprit's corporate culture was almost as colorful as its clothing. Employees at 
the firm's 10-acre San Francisco complex attended free language classes and 
could sign up for free tennis lessons on Esprit's grass court. Employees were 
also given tickets to cultural events as well as use of a company-owned Lake 
Tahoe ski cabin. 
</P>
<P>
As Esprit's sales and fame grew, so did tensions between the Tompkinses. The 
couple disagreed on what direction Esprit's clothing line would take. According 
to a March, 1988, story in the Wall Street Journal, company employees said Doug 
Tompkins had extramarital affairs with Esprit workers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are emotional relationships in any business," said Doug Tompkins in an 
interview with the Journal. "Whether they end up in bed or not, that's 
irrelevant. I don't know any such relationship that has caused adverse effects 
within this company." 
</P>
<P>
The Tompkinses' conflict over company strategy apparently hurt sales and 
profits, according to industry analysts. Esprit's move to build a chain of 
company-owned and franchised stores also proved costly. About 70 Esprit stores 
are in operation nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Esprit cut its staff and perks, and new managers from 
rival apparel firms were hired. As a result, industry officials said the 
company's bottom line has improved. 
</P>
<P>
But relations between the Tompkinses remained rocky. In 1988, three new 
directors joined Esprit's board as a result of a lawsuit filed by Susie 
Tompkins. Later, both Tompkinses abandoned most of their operational control 
over the company.

Bjorn Borg in Financial Trouble: Bjorn Borg said he refused an offer of fresh 
capital to rescue his struggling fashion business built on earnings from his 
10-year championship tennis career. Borg, 33, said he turned down $4.6 million 
to help Bjorn Borg Design Group because he was afraid of losing control of his 
companies. Borg said he was negotiating other financing to keep his business 
afloat. "I remain committed to the business and am in the process of trying to 
reorganize the management and corporate structure of the group," Borg said in a 
statement. Bjorn Borg produces a line of designer fashions, fragrances, shoes 
and accessories, and has real estate interests in Sweden. Lars Skarke, who has 
a 25% stake in Borg's companies, said the group was facing a "shortage of 
liquidity which is forcing the closure of the group."

Capital Cities/ABC Inc.: The New York-based broadcasting and communications 
company reported second-quarter profit of $140 million, up 23% over a year ago. 
Revenue totaled $1.2 billion, a gain of 6%. The results reflected growth in 
revenue from broadcasting operations, radio and ESPN and publishing, as well as 
reductions in entertainment programming and sports rights at the ABC television 
network from historic costs to fair market values.

HONEYWELL STEERS COURSE AWAY FROM WEAPONS

Honeywell Inc. on Monday announced a program of layoffs, stock buybacks and 
asset sales that will reduce its dependence on its weapons business, sending 
its stock sharply higher on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of the diversified manufacturing company closed $3.875 higher at 
$89.375 in heavy trading after the Minneapolis-based company made the 
announcement, which was aimed at boosting its stock price and its profits. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell said the funds raised from the asset sales and cost-cutting measures 
will be used to repurchase 10 million of its shares, valued at about $850 
million, expanding a previously announced 3.5-million-share repurchase plan. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell also said it will boost its annual common stock dividend 65 cents a 
share to $2.75 starting in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly positive for shareholders," said analyst Michael Lauer of Kidder, 
Peabody &amp; Co. He said Honeywell's latest actions are, in part, a response 
to prompting by an investor group that threatened to seek control of the firm 
unless its management acted to boost the share price. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell's stock has risen in recent months on takeover talk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cuts by Attrition, Layoffs 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell said the plan will boost its stock price and improve profits by 
emphasizing its automation and controls business, which it said has strong 
growth potential. It will begin reducing emphasis on its defense businesses, 
which are seen as having weaker prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell's plan calls for the reduction of 4,000 of its work force over the 
next 18 months through layoffs and attrition. Honeywell, with 1988 sales of 
$7.1 billion, has about 78,000 employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
A major part of the restructuring will be the sale of a substantial portion of 
its 50% interest in Yamatake-Honeywell, a Japanese controls company. It did not 
say how much the sale would be worth. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell also said it is committed to cutting its dependence on its weapons 
business, with flat growth expected in the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The weapons businesses are solid and profitable, staffed by first-rate 
employees, and they are important to the U.S. defense industrial and technology 
base," said James Renier, chief executive of Honeywell. "This is no fire sale. 
. . . These are excellent businesses performing well with solid programs," 
Renier said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its strategic importance, the pullback will be carried out "over 
time in a responsible manner," Honeywell said. The company's marine and defense 
business accounts for about one-fifth of its sales. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell said it expects an improvement of $150 million in its core business' 
operating profit because of the work force reductions, better working capital 
management and improved cost control. 
</P>
<P>
Additional profit-improvement measures include reductions in selling and 
administrative expenses, working capital and the focusing of research and 
development spending on core businesses.

L.A. MEDIAN COST HITS $220,253;

<P>
PRICES, INTEREST RATES SLOW JUNE HOME SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Sales of single-family houses fell 8.2% in the Los Angeles area during June, 
reinforcing the belief that soaring prices and rising interest rates earlier 
this year have stalled the frenzied market of 1988, the California Assn. of 
Realtors reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely an indication of a softening of demand," said Chris Taylor, 
the group's senior research economist. "Buyers are being more cautious and 
taking their time. They are holding back to see what is happening with interest 
rates and home prices." 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a house in California fell during June for the first time 
since December, dropping 0.7% from $201,930 in May to $200,445. However, last 
month's median price was 17.8% higher than in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And in the group's Los Angeles region, the median price rose 1.2% to $220,253 
in June from $217,708 in May. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, June's 487,000 home sales represented a 9.2% decline from May and a 
13.9% drop from June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate experts attributed at least part of the decline to the absence from 
the market of first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more homes available, but the prices are not in the affordable 
range," said Temmy Walker, president of James R. Gary &amp; Co. East in Studio 
City. "The affordable-priced house has disappeared like the dinosaur." 
</P>
<P>
The estimate by the realtors' group of the time it would take to sell the 
houses listed for sale statewide -- based on the current pace of sales -- rose 
from 5.6 months in May to 5.8 months in June. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley area is typical of the California market -- in June, 
1988, 1,918 houses were sold while 2,746 were for sale. Just last month, the 
Valley had 3,750 houses for sale, but only 1,578 sold. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, sales of single-family houses rose 6.9% in June but were down 
29.1% from a year ago. The median price was up 1.7% to $251,674 from $247,397 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
Such prices are out of reach of many first-time buyers. "Affordable is 
$200,000?," Walker asked. "C'mon. How many people can afford $200,000?" 
</P>
<P>
The realtors' association said it expects sales to be slower again this month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's likely because what is happening is that the increase in interest rates 
in March and April are just now reflecting in closed escrow sales," Taylor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The condominium market also took some hits during June. 
</P>
<P>
Sales were down 0.9% from May but were up 11.9% from the same period a year 
ago. The median price of $138,174 was a 0.7% decline from May's median of 
$139,117 but was 12.4% higher than the $122,903 of June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated time it would take to sell available condominiums grew from 4.6 
months in May to 4.8 months in June. 
</P>
<P>
"What used to be a sellers' market last year is now more of a balanced market," 
Taylor concluded. "We actually think the housing market will continue to be at 
a much slower pace than it was last year."

White-Collar Cuts Rumored at Chrysler: Chrysler Corp. said its top 600 
officials will meet Thursday with Chairman Lee A. Iacocca to discuss 
cost-reduction efforts amid widespread industry speculation that Chrysler will 
cut its white-collar staff. But the nation's No. 3 auto maker said any cuts 
would not affect research and development, capital spending or long-term 
product planning. The reported staff cuts at Chrysler would be the first 
specifically prompted by the current slump in new car sales. Ford Motor Co. and 
General Motors Corp. are trimming their white-collar payrolls through 
previously announced programs.

Bausch &amp; Lomb: The Rochester, N.Y., maker of health- and eye-care products 
said second-quarter net income rose 16% from a year ago to $27.4 million as 
brisk worldwide demand for health-care and optical products pushed its revenue 
up 28% to a quarterly record of $318.1 million.

U.S. banks earned a record $7.3 billion in the first quarter, but an 
information service compiling the report said Monday that the industry must 
come to terms with some short-term challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Sheshunoff &amp; Co. said that of the nation's 12,994 banks, 91% were 
profitable with total earnings of $7.8 billion in the period. But those profits 
were marginally offset by losses of $500 million at the unprofitable banks. 
</P>
<P>
Comparatively, the savings and loan industry lost $3.4 billion in the first 
quarter. Of the 2,946 institutions, 2,163, or 73%, were profitable in the first 
quarter with earnings of $1.4 billion. But the gains were erased by losses of 
$4.8 billion at the 783 unprofitable institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Although bank profits were exceptionally strong, company President Alex 
Sheshunoff said the industry must take note of the increasing probability of a 
recession, declining real estate values because of excessive growth in some 
regions, and the need of some banks to deal with the value of loans to lesser 
developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Loan Growth 
</P>
<P>
He said that with both businesses and consumers pulling back, there is clear 
indication the economy is slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first quarter, real estate loans remained the only major source of loan 
growth, increasing by $18 billion, or 2.83%, to $654 billion," Sheshunoff said. 
"Commercial and industrial loans rose only $3 billion, or 0.6%, to $500 
billion. And loans to individuals actually declined by $5.3 billion, or 1.47%, 
to $356 billion." 
</P>
<P>
In real estate, while the California market showed continued growth, the 
Southwestern market was burdened by tens of billions of dollars in repossessed 
real estate assets held by S&amp;Ls and regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"A soft landing in a highly leveraged industry such as real estate can mean a 
hard landing for the financial institutions involved," Sheshunoff said. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of overall strength, profitability and growth, the Southeast was the 
strong region with first-quarter loan growth of 1.8%, a 1.03% return on assets, 
and only 1.24% of non-performing loans. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia led the nation in loan growth with 
first-quarter increases of 4.73%, 4.01% and 2.92% respectively. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Super-Regional' Banks 
</P>
<P>
Alaska with 6.85% had the highest percentage of non-performing assets to gross 
loans. Arizona with 6.45% and Texas with 6.42% were next. 
</P>
<P>
"The bankers in the Southeast still remember the major problems they dealt with 
in the mid-1970s," Sheshunoff said. "Combining this respect for history with 
excellent bank management, the base has been built for a number of major 
'super-regional' banking organizations. Over the next few years the Southeast 
'super-regional' banks will become major, nationwide banking organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Home equity loans grew significantly from last year, especially in the 
Northeast and California, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo was the leading lender with $1.7 billion, up 14%; followed by 
Citibank $1.43 billion, up 15%; Bank of America $1.27 billion, up 135%; 
Security Pacific with $835 million, up 122%, and Connecticut National Bank with 
$632 million, up 106%. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign loans increased only slightly from the previous year at the three 
largest banks that make foreign loans. Citibank held the largest amount of 
foreign loans with $52.8 billion, up 4.3%. Chase Manhattan had $29 billion, up 
1.2% and Bank of America $22.1 billion, up 0.6%.

PACTEL GETS CABLE-TV FRANCHISES ABROAD; 
</P>
<P>
WINS 2 LICENSES IN GREAT BRITAIN, PRESSES FOR CLEARANCE IN CHICAGO

Pacific Telesis moved another step Monday toward its goal of becoming a major 
player in the cable television business at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based company said the Cable Authority of Great Britain 
awarded franchises to a pair of companies in which Pacific Telesis has about a 
50% interest. The franchises authorize construction of cable systems to serve 
140,000 homes overall in the cities of Norwich and Peterborough, each about 100 
miles northeast of London. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the company joined with Jones Intercable of Englewood, Colo., an 
international cable management firm, to buy East London Telecommunications. The 
venture is licensed to serve about 380,000 homes and provides local telephone 
service in London's new Dockside development area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans to Seek Waiver 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis, the parent of Pacific Bell, is forbidden from providing cable 
service in the United States under the terms of the 1984 settlement that broke 
up American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. But company spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg 
said Pacific Telesis plans to file for a waiver from U.S. District Judge Harold 
H. Greene, who oversees the AT&amp;T breakup agreement. If granted, the company 
could exercise a four-year option that it acquired last April to acquire 68% of 
a cable operation serving Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The National Cable Television Assn. opposes such a waiver, claiming that 
Pacific Telesis and the six other so-called Baby Bell companies would have an 
unfair advantage over competing cable TV companies because of their local 
telephone monopolies. But the nation's biggest cable operator, 
Tele-Communications Inc., took a more moderate position, saying it would not 
oppose a waiver if cable operations were restricted to markets outside the Baby 
Bell's local service area. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis' partner in its new British cable ventures is Masada UK Cable 
Partners, a cable operator based in Birmingham, Ala. Masada ranks among the top 
100 companies operating multiple cable systems, serving 60,000 subscribers in 
urban markets mostly in the southeastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
"With the addition of these franchises, Pacific Telesis International is now 
licensed to provide cable service to over half a million homes" in Britain, 
said C. Lee Cox, group president of Pacific Telesis' unregulated operations. 
Cox called cable "an excellent long-term business opportunity in Western 
Europe."

PEOPLE: FOUNDER OF TURN RETIRES AS ITS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sylvia M. Siegel, who 16 years ago founded the San Francisco-based consumer 
organization known as TURN (from its formal name of Toward Utility Rate 
Normalization), has retired as executive director. Siegel was succeeded by 
Audrie Krause, who formerly wrote about public utility issues for the Fresno 
Bee and its parent, McClatchy Newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Also joining TURN is Karen Miller, a former regulatory analyst for the 
California Public Utilities Commission. Miller will work on the recently 
created state Telecommunications Education project funded by a PUC-imposed fine 
against Pacific Bell for abusive marketing practices in selling the company's 
telephone services. Miller headed that investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Under Siegel's leadership, TURN developed a statewide membership of 45,000 and 
intervened in PUC proceedings involving rates and practices. Part of the 
group's income comes from attorney fees awarded by the PUC when the group's 
intervention is deemed to have played a significant role in the commission's 
decisions. Its budget is $725,000. 
</P>
<P>
Krause will direct operations from TURN's new headquarters at 625 Polk Street, 
a block from PUC headquarters. The group's telephone number is 415-929-TURN.

INVESTORS READY TO CLOSE NORTHWEST AIR DEAL 
</P>

<P>
The investment group proposing to buy Northwest Airlines for $3.65 billion said 
Monday that it was on the brink of closing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
More than 99% of shares in parent NWA Inc. had been tendered to the group, 
Wings Holdings Inc., by Monday morning, according to the group headed by Alfred 
A. Checchi, the former Marriott Corp. treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi, who lives in Beverly Hills, said his financing was nearly in place and 
that he was pressing for early termination of the waiting period required under 
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Ruling Monday 
</P>
<P>
Checchi said Wings was seeking to have the waiting period end Monday instead of 
its scheduled expiration Wednesday. The Federal Trade Commission, however, did 
not issue a ruling Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The $121-a-share tender offer originally was set to expire at midnight last 
Friday, but Checchi extended the deadline to 4 p.m. CDT Monday. David Duffy, a 
Wings spokesman in New York, said the offer may be extended again this morning 
before the New York Stock Exchange opens. 
</P>
<P>
NWA closed up 87.5 cents a share at $120.25 in NYSE trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NWA reported record second-quarter earnings of $70.8 million. The 
profit was more than double that for the second quarter a year ago, when the 
airline earned $28.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the quarter climbed 19.3% to $1.65 billion from $1.38 billion in 
1988, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
NWA Chairman Steven G. Rothmeier said passenger traffic rose 16% over a year 
ago, with capacity growing 15.6%. The airline also experienced a 16.8% increase 
in freight revenue to $132.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings for the first half of 1989 were $83.3 million on revenue of $3.13 
billion. That contrasted with a $15.1-million net loss for the first six months 
of 1988, when revenue was $2.62 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest's pilots union and NWA resumed contract talks Monday with the help of 
Josh Javits, chairman of the National Mediation Board. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement with the pilots is considered crucial to Checchi's plans to 
acquire the airline because a strike could impair his ability to generate 
enough cash to pay for the NWA acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal regulations, if the pilots request that negotiations be declared 
at an impasse they could strike after a 30-day cooling-off period. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Thornton, NWA vice president and general counsel, said the primary issues 
remaining to be settled include wages, work rules and job security. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the pilots remained interested in a possible ownership position in 
the airline, but added that the other issues would have to be resolved first.

Unisys Corp.: The Blue Bell, Pa.-based computer and defense giant said 
second-quarter earnings fell 67% to $53.6 million despite an 8% increase in 
revenue to $2.57 billion. The firm attributed the sharp earnings drop to the 
expense of cutting inventories, pricing pressures from competitors and the 
temporary suspension of its defense business by the Pentagon. Also, the rise in 
the dollar decreased the dollar value of sales made in foreign currencies.

Oil companies: Amerada Hess said second-quarter profit was $133.5 million, 
contrasted with a loss of $23.5 million a year ago. Revenue was $1.5 billion, 
up from $883 million a year ago. The New York-based company said refining and 
marketing operations recovered, earning $125.5 million for the period, 
contrasted with a loss of $6.5 million a year ago. Chicago-based Amoco posted 
second-quarter earnings of $497 million, down 26% from last year's results, 
which included $136 million in one-time gains. Revenue advanced 11% to $6.8 
billion. The results include special charges of $36 million for the period and 
noted that a big decline in chemical earnings offset gains in exploration, 
production, refining and marketing. Los Angeles-based Arco reported 
second-quarter profit of $467 million, up 17% over a year ago. Sales and other 
operating revenue totaled $4.3 billion, down 7%. The results reflected strong 
worldwide crude markets, record coal production, increased domestic natural gas 
production and higher margins for refining and marketing, which offset the 
firm's reduced ownership in Lyondell Petrochemical Co. and several planned 
maintenance projects. Ashland, Ky.-based Ashland Oil Inc. said third-quarter 
earnings were down 23% to $44 million. Sales rose 5% to $57 million. The 
company said the decline in profit was largely because of disappointing results 
from its engineering and construction segment, which posted a $4-million loss 
in the period.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: MATTHEWS STUDIO TO BUY HOLLYWOOD RENTAL CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matthews Studio Equipment Group of Burbank announced signing a letter of intent 
to acquire Hollywood Rental Co. and its subsidiary, Expendable Supply Store of 
Sun Valley, through an exchange of stock. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the tentative agreement, Matthews, which makes and sells 
lighting accessories and camera equipment for the motion picture industry, will 
acquire all of Hollywood Rental's stock in exchange for about 10% of its own 
stock, said Greg Moiseeff, Matthews's counsel and executive vice president. 
Hollywood Rental rents and sells film production equipment and office supplies 
to film makers. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews said the revenue of the combined firms would be $15 million in the 
current fiscal year. In its latest fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Matthews 
had sales of $8.3 million and a profit of $223,000.

MOBILE STUDIO FIRM HELPS THE CAMERAS ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the late 1960s Paul Casella Jr. was working at Twentieth Century-Fox Film 
Corp. as a transportation captain in charge of organizing a caravan of trucks 
full of generators, lights, electrical cable and other equipment to drive out 
to remote motion picture locations. Sometimes there would be more than a dozen 
trucks, he said, "and production people were always raising hell because you 
had so many drivers." 
</P>
<P>
So Casella, along with a few others, got the idea of combining as many as five 
of the trucks into one jumbo tractor-trailer rig, which would help cut driving 
costs and create a true mobile studio. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, with $1,250, Casella bought a used trailer and -- after fixing it up 
on weekends -- leased a tractor to pull it. With two electrical generators to 
power it, he had a mobile studio to rent. For the next few years, by relying on 
his movie transportation contacts, he was able to lease his mobile studio 
almost continuously. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1971, actor Paul Newman, impressed with the job Casella did managing 
transportation for the shooting of "The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean," 
insisted that Casella's name appear in the film's credits, with the grand title 
"transportation coordinator." 
</P>
<P>
By then, Casella knew that he had both the knack and the name to form a 
company: Transcord Enterprises. So he incorporated and went full time into the 
mobile studio business. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Casella has 17 mobile studios -- some of them 45 feet long -- and about 
40 other trailers, trucks and pickups used for location filming. Casella's 
privately owned Burbank company does about $1.4 million a year in sales. His 
rivals in the fragmented mobile-studio business say his is the biggest fleet of 
mobile studios among independents transporting equipment in the filming of many 
TV series and movies. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, Casella, 53, said his trucks have been hired to take lights, 
electrical supplies other equipment to locations for network television shows 
such as "Moonlighting," "The Wonder Years," "thirtysomething," "Police Story," 
and "Beauty and the Beast," as well as to sites for films such as "Lethal 
Weapon 2," "Beaches," "Alien Nation," "Midnight Run," and "The Dead Pool." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Competition 
</P>
<P>
Despite the impressive credits, Casellas hardly has the business to himself. 
First, the major studios have their own large fleets of trucks, leaving private 
mobile studio leasers to find jobs with independent film makers and 
supplementing those fleets for the studios' biggest efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Casella said that one trick to expanding his business has been to keep costs 
low. He said he has only four people on Transcord's payroll: one who keeps the 
books and three who maintain and modify the trucks. Casella insists that 
renters of his mobile studios put the drivers on their own payroll. And Casella 
said he doesn't even pay himself a salary from Transcord, preferring to plow 
more profits back into the company while he works part time as a transportation 
consultant to Columbia Pictures and Warner Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Casella's company has grown even as prices to rent his equipment have steadily 
dropped. Casella said that in the late 1960s, his mobile studiocost as much as 
$4,800 a week to rent. Today, he said, longtime customers pay $1,350 a week. 
Casella's former marketing man said competition drove prices down. But one of 
his rivals, George Hill, said it was Casella who did the price-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
In the late seventies and early eighties Casella made sure his trucks were all 
busy, regardless of the fee they commanded, Hill said, Casella "didn't care 
particularly how much each vehicle brought in. He just told his agent just to 
keep them moving." But Bruce Woollen, who was Transcord's sales agent during 
many of those years, denied that Casella purposely underpriced the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Besides George Hill Mobile Studios in Sun Valley, which has two mobile studios, 
Casella has other independent competitors. Keylite PSI, a Burbank company that 
leases grip and electrical equipment, just bought five new mobile studios -- 
which they call production vans -- enlarging its fleet to ten. Filmtrucks, a 
New Jersey-based company with an office in North Hollywood, has about five 
mobile studios in California. 
</P>
<P>
Casella also looks for small advantages where he can find them. He and his wife 
run travel agencies that specialize in motion picture clients, which helps them 
keep track of out of town locales selected for filming. Casella's consulting 
work for the studios, Hill maintained, is also a boon. "I don't have an 
advertising budget," Casella said. "It's all by word of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
And Casella has kept a shrewd eye on competitors, occasionally using profits to 
buy them out. In 1979, he bought for about $75,000 a manufacturer of portable 
generators who was selling to Transcord's rivals. And in 1985, Casella bought a 
rival mobile studio renter's seven trucks for about $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Casella got his start in the movie business driving a catering truck to film 
locations in 1955 when he was in college. After college, he got a job as a 
driver for Twentieth Century-Fox. He's been on the road, one way or another, 
ever since.

PAPER TRUCE; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLISHER STUDIES SALE TO COMPETING WEEKLY HE FOUNDED 11 YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven years ago, Daniel J. Schmidt, then a 23-year-old journalism student, 
borrowed $2,000 from his parents to start a weekly newspaper, the Moorpark News 
in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
After a year, it was clear the paper was struggling. "I didn't know anything 
about business," Schmidt recalled. So he sold the paper for $10,500, agreed not 
to compete against the News for five years, and went elsewhere to work as a 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Five years and two weeks later, Schmidt returned to Moorpark to start a weekly 
newspaper, the Moorpark Mirror, to try to sink the News. The News "had eroded 
in quality," he said. "I knew Moorpark needed another newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
This time Schmidt had more staying power. His Mirror managed to survive for 
five years by often taking community leaders to task -- sometimes excessively, 
his critics say -- and by hustling for advertising. The News "palled around 
with all the community big shots," he said. "They did all the PR kinds of 
things, all the fluff kinds of stories, and left the real meat for me, and I 
went after it with a vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
But the Mirror did not sink the News, which has deeper pockets than Schmidt. 
The News is jointly owned by two newspaper groups, Harris Enterprises of 
Hutchinson, Kan., and John P. Scripps Newspapers of San Diego, a unit of E.W. 
Scripps Co. And the Mirror and News say that as they struggled against each 
other, neither was making big profits. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Schmidt and the News are about to make peace. Last week, Schmidt 
tentatively agreed to sell the Mirror to the News for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
The sale "gives me an opportunity to collect in one lump sum the spoils of six 
years of hard work, and gives me the resources and time to launch my next 
project," perhaps another newspaper, Schmidt said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The News claims that about 1,500 people buy its paper, and that another 1,000 
are given away each week to various neighborhoods to spur additional 
subscriptions. The Mirror, meanwhile, claims a paid circulation of 500, but it 
gives out about 3,700 free issues. The paper is owned by Schmidt alone. 
</P>
<P>
Debra W. Ryono, editor and publisher of the News, said her paper's decision to 
buy out Schmidt was an option that the News had considered several times in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The News-Mirror fight was unusual in that Schmidt was, in effect, competing 
against his past. But it also was unusual in that Moorpark, a town of about 
30,000 just north of Thousand Oaks in Ventura County, had managed to support 
two independent weekly papers at a time when even big cities are increasingly 
unable to generate enough advertising and readership to host two or more 
hometown publications. 
</P>
<P>
The number of U.S. cities with two or more daily newspapers under separate 
ownership currently totals 43, or only 3% of the 1,526 total dailies, according 
to the American Newspaper Publishers Assn., a trade group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Competition 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the News and the Mirror still had to fight for advertising dollars 
with several daily newspapers that also are sold in Moorpark, including The 
Enterprise in Simi Valley, the News Chronicle in Thousand Oaks and the Ventura 
County Star-Free Press. (Harris and Scripps also own The Enterprise.) 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt agreed to the sale even though it appeared Moorpark's surging growth 
might generate enough new business, and therefore advertising, to support both 
the News and the Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, long known as an agricultural hamlet, has been caught up in Los 
Angeles' progress. Acres of new houses are being built and, although Moorpark 
has a slow-growth plan to limit the expansion, the town's population has nearly 
doubled in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet although Schmidt is preparing to sell the Mirror, it's unclear whether the 
Mirror will go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt claimed he will "not sell the Mirror if the Mirror ceased to exist 
after the sale," and that the Mirror's future is a detail yet to be worked out 
before the sale can proceed. "I didn't work six years just to be bought off and 
chased out of town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing Final 
</P>
<P>
The News' Ryono said "this is all open for discussion, nothing is definite 
yet." But, indicating that the News expects only one paper to survive, she said 
a merged "Moorpark News Mirror" might be the end result. 
</P>
<P>
Ryono said last week that it was not immediately known if Schmidt would 
continue with the Mirror or the News after the sale. If so, he would be joining 
a newspaper he has heavily criticized. A few days before the merger plans were 
announced, Schmidt said the News had "ignored controversial subjects" in its 
news coverage. The Mirror challenged Moorpark's power structure, Schmidt said, 
while the News has "cozied up to it." 
</P>
<P>
Ryono denied Schmidt's characterization of her paper, and said "people 
sometimes tend to think that Dan takes things maybe a little bit out of 
context, or blows them up a little bit more than what they should be." Besides, 
she said, "he doesn't carry as much news" as her paper. 
</P>
<P>
The News views itself as a traditional, family-oriented local newspaper that 
covers not only crime, environmental problems and other pressing concerns, but 
also reports on piano recitals or pinning ceremonies at the Cub Scouts. 
"Everybody likes to see their name in the newspaper," Ryono said. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, meanwhile, likes challenging the actions of the City Council and other 
community leaders, and seems to relish the animosity his stories generate. 
"Dan's outlook has always been more of a muckraker at City Hall; he likes to 
stir things up," Ryono said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Notices 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt also believes he scored a coup a few weeks ago when he won the contract 
to print the city's legal notices -- the announcements of public hearings and 
so forth that the city is required to publish -- by underbidding the News, 
which had the contract in recent years. Schmidt asked for 50 cents per line of 
type from the city; the News sought 53 cents. 
</P>
<P>
It also prompted him to call the Mirror "Moorpark's Newspaper of Record." The 
contract "was more than just a moral victory, it was a marketing victory as 
well, because for five years they had it, and now they've lost it," Schmidt 
said of the News. 
</P>
<P>
Ryono downplayed Schmidt's victory. "I would have liked to have kept them," she 
said of the notices. "I don't know how many people get a paper, though, just 
because of the city legals running in it." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, lots of Moorpark residents aren't buying either paper, given the 
number of free issues each delivers. But the freebies have a purpose: They help 
the News and Mirror persuade advertisers that their papers are reaching a wide 
audience, and it's advertising that pays the bulk of a newspaper's bills, not 
paid subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advertising Competition 
</P>
<P>
But having two weeklies in town forces many advertisers to make a choice. Simi 
Valley Bank, for instance, advertises regularly in The Enterprise of Simi 
Valley, which also sells in Moorpark. So rather than advertise in the News, 
which is owned by the same people, it runs half-page ads in the Mirror for $234 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to cover our bases," said Barbara Williamson, a vice president of 
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Now the advertisers might have one fewer choice if the News and the Mirror 
merge. But Schmidt insists there will be no merger unless the Mirror continues 
to be published by its proposed new owner. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if the sale is "simply a way for Goliath to say to David, 'We're 
going to get rid of you and go back to business as usual,' I'm prepared to 
stick around another six years." 
</P>
<P>
But publisher Ryono said that if the deal goes through to buy Schmidt's paper, 
it'll probably have the usual clause preventing him from starting another paper 
in town.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: TROUBLED LINCOLN S&amp;L TO CLOSE OFFICE IN GLENDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lincoln Savings and Loan, which was seized in April by federal regulators who 
said the thrift's assets had been "substantially dissipated," will close its 
Glendale office on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based S&amp;L will consolidate that office with its Burbank branch, 
transferring 5,200 accounts and 3,500 customers, because the city of Glendale 
plans to clear the site to make way for a park. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Seibold, who oversees Lincoln and five other S&amp;Ls for the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp., said Lincoln will take advantage of the forced closing 
to cut costs at the beleaguered thrift. Regulators said the combined branches 
would have deposits of $160 million.

VALLEY EARNINGS: AMWEST INSURANCE GROUP'S 2ND-QUARTER PROFITS FLAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amwest Insurance Group, a Woodland Hills provider of bail bonds and other 
surety bonds, said its second-quarter profit inched down to $879,000 from 
$880,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The flat results came despite a 63% increase in Amwest's net premiums earned -- 
a gauge of Amwest's insurance underwriting revenue -- to $8.46 million from 
$5.19 million. 
</P>
<P>
The latest earnings would have been higher except for a $200,000 charge that 
Amwest recorded from its previously announced settlement of lawsuits between 
the company and Dallas County, Tex. The lawsuits stemmed from a dispute over 
whether Amwest was liable for reimbursing the county for thousands of bail 
bonds written by a former Amwest agent in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1989, Amwest's profit rose 13% to $1.87 million from 
$1.67 million, while its net premiums earned jumped 67% to $17.3 million from 
$10.3 million.

VALLEY EARNINGS: TEKELEC QUARTERLY EARNINGS DROP 57%; REVENUE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tekelec, a Calabasas maker of equipment used in testing telecommunications 
products, said its second-quarter earnings tumbled 57% from a year earlier 
despite a 12% increase in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Tekelec's net income for the three months that ended June 30 dropped to 
$563,000 from $1.3 million a year ago, but its revenue climbed to $8.25 million 
from $7.40 million. For the first half of this year, Tekelec's profit fell 25% 
to $1.81 million from $2.40 million, and its six-month revenue rose 23% to 
$17.4 million from $14.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tekelec blamed the reduced earnings on higher costs and less than expected 
growth in revenue. The costs were associated with the introduction of a 
product, and higher engineering and customer service expenses.

VALLEY EARNINGS: HUNTWAY REPORTS 52% DIP IN 2ND-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntway Partners, a Valencia-based producer of liquid asphalt, said its 
second-quarter profit tumbled 52% from a year earlier, to $1.13 million from 
$2.34 million. 
</P>
<P>
Huntway's revenue in the quarter that ended June 30 rose to $24.1 million from 
$22.6 million. For the first half of 1989, Huntway's profit fell 22% to $2.55 
million from $3.27 million, and its revenue was virtually unchanged at $42 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Huntway went public in November and used the proceeds in part to reduce its 
debt. Its year-earlier financial results are on a pro forma basis, that is, 
they reflect what Huntway's results would have been had Huntway gone public and 
reduced its debt in early 1988 instead of later that year.

Micropolis, a Chatsworth producer of computer data-storage systems, reported a 
$10.6-million loss for the second quarter, compared with a year-earlier profit 
of $1.17 million.

How many dancers who debuted on Broadway back in 1936 are still going strong in 
musical theater today? 
</P>
<P>
Harold Nicholas, one of the stars of Starlight Musical Theater's "My One and 
Only," just might be the one and only. 
</P>
<P>
"There sure aren't too many," said Nicholas, 64, who will appear in the 
two-week run at the Starlight Bowl starting Wednesday. "Most dancers don't last 
long, and I keep asking myself how I did it. But there's still a couple of old 
tap dancers around, like the ones I danced with in 'Black and Blue,' " he said 
of the Broadway hit. 
</P>
<P>
Harold and his brother Fayard, the legendary Nicholas Brothers, tap-danced 
their way from the famous Cotton Club to Broadway and the silver screen during 
more than 58 years in show business.

The great George Balanchine discovered them in "The Ziegfield Follies of 1936" 
and snared the twosome (along with their original tap routines) for Rodgers and 
Hart's "Babes in Arms." 
</P>
<P>
In the late '30s and all through the '40s, the golden age of Hollywood 
musicals, the tap-dancing team of Harold and Fayard Nicholas was considered 
tops, and the old-time hoofers danced up a storm in more than 30 movie 
musicals. In fact, Harold's gravity-defying escapades in "Orchestra Wives" was 
the model for Donald O'Connor's show-stopping, off-the-wall routine in "Singin' 
in the Rain." 
</P>
<P>
Fayard, the older of the two brothers, has curtailed his dancing considerably 
in recent years, although he still teams up with his old partner for some soft 
shoe from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
But Harold, an indomitable hoofer even now that he's pushing 65, continues his 
fast-paced, globe-trotting career in show business. And he insists that 
retirement is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
"No! Why should I retire? I'm still in good shape. I never really had any 
injuries or other problems, and I'm not exactly doing my splits anymore. 
There's no dancing on stairs or on the walls now," he said, referring to the 
acrobatic antics that became his calling card in all those splashy movie 
musicals. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I can do any of that anymore. We were young in those days, and 
we were just having fun," he said, a touch of nostalgia in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
"I travel more now and do more singing than dancing. But I never stopped tap 
dancing, ever since I started as a boy of about 6 or 7. My brother taught 
himself to tap dance, and then he taught me. I've been dancing ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the resurgence of tap on dance school curricula, and the accent on 
tap-trained performers for Broadway shows, Nicholas is not optimistic about a 
renaissance in this jazz-based style. 
</P>
<P>
"Tap dancing never really left," he said. "I still keep doing it. But it's more 
like a novelty now, and I don't think it's ever going to take off like it was. 
It's good that they're looking for tap training on Broadway now, though." 
</P>
<P>
Dancing the part of Mr. Magix, the tap-happy role created on Broadway by 
Charles (Honi) Coles), is not a new experience for Nicholas. He pounced on 
Gershwin's fascinating rhythms for "My One and Only" in a production for the 
San Bernardino Civic Light Opera earlier this year. Kirby Ward, who takes on 
Tommy Tune's role in the Starlight run, was his tap-dancing co-star there, too. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas was not due in San Diego to rehearse with the company until a couple 
of days before its local debut, but that doesn't worry this seasoned trooper. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done it before, so all I need is a little time to refresh myself," he 
said. "Two days is enough." 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Ward, who shares director/choreographer credits with husband Don for 
this San Diego premiere, is convinced that Nicholas will dance right into the 
role without a hitch, even on minimal rehearsal time. 
</P>
<P>
"Harold has danced the role before, and he got a chance to rehearse with Kirby 
in New York for six to eight hours, doing that wonderful laid-back duet," she 
said. "But he could do this part in his sleep. Don and I have admired his work 
since we were youngsters starting in the business. 
</P>
<P>
"He's basically an institution in the tap-dance field," she noted, "and we're 
so thrilled to have him here. He'll get to put a few of his special touches in 
the role." 
</P>
<P>
"My One and Only" will keep Nicholas in San Diego through Aug. 13. Then it's 
back to a busy solo schedule for the veteran dance man. 
</P>
<P>
But in February, both of the Nicholas Brothers are headed this way for the San 
Diego Foundation for the Performing Arts' season finale, "Gotta Sing, Gotta 
Dance," a song-and-dance fest that features Cotton Club superstar Cab Calloway, 
the dapper "Hi-De-Ho" man. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left for Europe, plans still weren't finalized for the 'Gotta Sing, 
Gotta Dance' show," said Nicholas, obviously surprised that the news was 
already out. "You're telling me something I don't know yet. But I love coming 
to San Diego. I'm a big golfer, and you can be sure I'm looking forward to 
getting out on those links."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KEN HERMAN: SINGER STRUGGLES TO 
PLUCK SPIRITUALS FROM DEEP ABYSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In both performance and recording, the current preoccupation appears to be 
restoring music to its original state. Period instrument orchestras, from 
London's Hanover Band to the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra, thrive, and a new 
generation of singers has been trained to execute Baroque ornamentation 
fluently and to improvise cadenzas on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
Mezzo-soprano Blanche Foreman is an advocate of another rich vein of authentic 
performance practice, one much closer to home for many American musicians than 
the opera-ballets of Lully or the early symphonies of Haydn. Foreman sings the 
solo vocal arrangements of Negro spirituals and art songs written by black 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
According to Foreman, the Negro spiritual has suffered as much from prejudice 
by the American music establishment as from neglect or confusion by the current 
generation of black musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"In the most prestigious vocal competitions, you cannot sing a Negro spiritual 
arranged by a black composer," explained Foreman, "although in the category of 
American music, they would let you sing Aaron Copland's setting of 'Shall We 
Gather at the River?' And the younger generation thinks that spirituals are 
some form of Gospel music, which is now the vogue. The spiritual has really 
been abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
A member of Vassar College's music faculty, Foreman did much of her research on 
the Negro spiritual while pursuing her doctorate at Indiana University. This 
week in San Diego, Foreman will present two recitals in which she will combine 
spirituals, art songs by black American composers, and song cycles by Gustav 
Mahler. Friday night she will sing at Hillcrest's Words and Music Gallery, and 
Sunday at 4 p.m. she will appear at La Jolla's St. James Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
According to Foreman, the first Negro spirituals arranged for piano and voice 
were done early in the century by Henry T. Burleigh, who studied harmony with 
Dvorak. Paul Robeson's accompanist, Lawrence Brown, was also a prolific 
arranger of spirituals, as was Hall Johnson, whose popular choir sang the sound 
track for the 1936 movie "Green Pastures." 
</P>
<P>
Foreman not only performs this repertory, but teaches spirituals to her college 
vocal students along with opera and traditional European art songs. 
</P>
<P>
"With the right training, anyone can sing spirituals," she said. "You don't 
have to be black. After all, I'm by no means German, and I sing Mahler." 
</P>
<P>
Foreman's other crusade is performing art songs written by black American 
composers. From this repertory, she champions songs composed by the late 
Margaret Bonds, who set the poetry of Langston Hughes to music, as well as 
compositions by Charles Lloyd and Leslie Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"There are at least 600 of these songs out there, but getting them published is 
one of the greatest problems," Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi tales. Last week, San Diego Symphony music director designate Yoav Talmi 
smiled for the cameras and cut a red ribbon to open the new box office in 
Symphony Towers. For the rest of his week in San Diego, however, he kept a low 
profile. He met extensively with executive director Wesley Brustad to map out 
the 1990-91 season, Talmi's first season as music director, and he listened to 
some trumpet auditions. In anticipation of the orchestra's new Pulitzer Series 
at UC San Diego, he visited the UCSD campus. 
</P>
<P>
This week he is back on the podium conducting two programs for the final week 
of the Houston Symphony's Mostly Mozart festival. Tomorrow night at Houston's 
Jones Hall, Talmi will be joined by cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, a familiar soloist 
to San Diego Symphony audiences, in the Haydn C Major Cello Concerto. Friday, 
Talmi will lead the Houston crew and soloist Ken Noda in Mozart's Piano 
Concerto No. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Local audiences will have to wait until Oct. 13 for their turn to hear Talmi 
and Mozart, however, when the Israeli conductor's season-opening concert will 
pair Mahler's Fifth Symphony with Mozart's A Major Piano Concerto, K. 488, with 
pianist Garrick Ohlsson. 
</P>
<P>
Alfresco nuptials. Hospitality Point, the San Diego Symphony's summer digs, 
provided the backdrop for orchestra horn player Doug Hall's wedding 
re-enactment Thursday evening. Forty relatives and symphony colleagues gathered 
behind the stage to witness Hall's restaged nuptials to Laura Zoeckler. 
Minister Nels Oas presided at Thursday's reprised ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The two were married by a justice of the peace in June, but chose this time, 
before a SummerPops concert, to allow members of Hall's musical family to 
attend. In keeping with Hall's profession, the wedding music was supplied by a 
brass ensemble. Hal Wingard, husband of symphony violinist Eileen Wingard, 
offered an original song, which he accompanied on guitar. After the ceremony, 
Hall went to work deep in the bowels of the horn section while Laura and her 
attendants joined the SummerPops audience.

Bobby Rich, the head of KFMB-FM's (B100) popular "Morning Zoo," was expected to 
sign a letter of intent Monday afternoon to become general manager of two radio 
stations in Seattle owned by locally based Noble Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Rich, who also is B100's program director, is a native of Seattle. He will head 
up KMGI-FM, which features the same type of adult contemporary format as B100, 
and KIXI-AM, which has a nostalgic rock format. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically it's my home turf," Rich said Monday. "When I grew up in Washington 
state, it was always my dream to have a station in Seattle." 
</P>
<P>
The Morning Zoo, with the "Rich Brothers," was the first group morning show, 
featuring skits, sound effects and and non-stop jokes, to succeed in San Diego. 
Since its debut in 1984, it has consistently ranked among San Diego's most 
popular morning shows. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's one of the most charismatic programmers/managers within the 
format," Noble Broadcasting President John Lynch said. "He's going to a market 
where it is important to have roots." 
</P>
<P>
Rich's last day with B100 is expected to be Aug. 11. Mike Novak, who has been 
with B100 for three years, has been named acting program director. 
</P>
<P>
"The Morning Zoo featuring the Rich Brothers will continue on," KFMB General 
Manager Paul Palmer said. "We'll miss Bobby, but the three (remaining) guys 
will do the show, and we'll probably add another Rich Brother soon." KEVIN 
BRASS

LOOKING AT DANCE IN A LITERALLY DIFFERENT LIGHT

<P>
Modern dance fans who flock to Three's Company's summer Lo-Tec concerts have 
learned to look at dance in a different light. But, last weekend, visiting 
choreographer Heidi Duckler moved the concert to a nearby parking lot and 
turned the lights down even lower to drive home a point on perspective. 
</P>
<P>
The evening began on a traditional note -- with Duckler's dancers doing 
excerpts from a full-length work by their resident choreographer. Then, about 
halfway through the evening, the entire audience was ushered out of the studio 
and directed to the parking lot for a decidedly nontraditional experience. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that the crowd was introduced to Duckler's special brand of Lo-Tec 
dance, a site-specific work lighted by automobile headlights. By the time the 
audience had assembled on the opposite side of the performing area, the six 
dancers, decked out in resort wear and sunglasses, were already languishing on 
beach chairs. And they "danced" most of the piece without removing themselves 
from the chairs lined up along the brick wall of the adjacent building. 
</P>
<P>
It was tongue-in-cheek all the way as "Sight Specific" poked fun at the 
superficiality of a tourist's-eye view of the world. Even the spectators got 
into the act when the dancers turned their instant cameras on the crowd -- 
snapping pictures of the ogling audience. Like the target of their satire, the 
dancers seemed oblivious to the real nature of the event. 
</P>
<P>
If the comic theater piece seemed oddly out of place in an asphalt parking lot, 
that was the ironic edge to the message: that tourists soak up the sun without 
ever ingesting the true cultural experience. On a broader scale, 
"Sight-Specific" lampooned the quirky inaccuracies of perception. 
</P>
<P>
The eight sets of headlights that surrounded both the dancers and the audience 
threw more than enough light on the subject, and added a touch of the macabre 
that would have been difficult to duplicate indoors. They may never replace 
standard lighting instruments, but the automobile lights did have a fascinating 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
The studio-bound dances that shared the evening with Duckler's outdoor novelty 
were much more traditional. Three's Company billed the concert as a "split 
evening," and it was -- in more ways than one. In addition to its double venue, 
it was divided between two very different dance makers. 
</P>
<P>
Duckler's part of the program included two excerpts from her full-length 
"Ancient Terrain." The short curtain-raiser might have suffered by being seen 
out of context, but it seemed more interesting for its Day-Glo costumes 
(uncredited on the program) than for its symbolic or kinetic thrust. And the 
score was so over-amplified as to be grating. 
</P>
<P>
The meatier second segment, which showed off the company's technique, was 
weightlessly buoyant and strong in its imagery. The opening solo had Duckler 
rising from behind a rock, like a mermaid emerging from the ocean. And the 
dance continued to ebb and flow through most of its ensemble maneuvers. Only 
when the dance grew too literal did it seem pretentious or forced. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked into the first part of the program was a brief solo, danced and 
choreographed by Lorna Dunn, a long-limbed, limber dancer who is an intern with 
Three's Company this summer. "New Moon" made its strongest statement with a 
dark silhouette of Dunn set against an eerie, red-lit backdrop. Borrowed 
Graham-esque images pervaded the piece as the dance unfolded, but Dunn proved 
she could command the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, a group of nine Three's Company interns took part in a 
work-in-progress by Lar Lubovitch soloist Rick Michalek. Michalek titled the 
piece "Studies for a Duet," and it was obvious that the budding choreographer 
was cataloguing permutations on the two-dancer theme. However, few of the 
couplings he created for this concert were particularly interesting or 
inventive, and the dancers would have benefited from a little more rehearsal 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's performance played to a packed house -- the biggest crowd of 
this Lo-Tec season. In fact, many gung-ho dance watchers were forced to squat 
on floor mats in front of the grandstands. But that didn't seem to dampen their 
enthusiasm for this unusual mixed bill. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, the San Jose-based Margaret Wingrove Dance Company makes its San 
Diego debut, and Shawn Womack, a visiting workshop instructor from Ohio, 
unveils a new work for five Three's Company interns.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two gunmen exchanged shots with an armored car guard before escaping with an 
unknown amount of money Monday morning in a robbery at the Fox Hills Mall in 
Culver City, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the incident on the second floor of the mall's parking 
structure, but the gunmen made off with several money bags that were being 
loaded onto the Loomis armored car, Culver City Police Lt. Tom Gabor said. 
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, a Culver City police officer arrested a Los Angeles man, Valdez 
Wright, 25, in the robbery of a Security Pacific National Bank branch about 
12:30 p.m., but police said they were unsure if the two holdups are related. 
</P>
<P>
In the mall robbery, Gabor said, two men approached a guard who was loading the 
bags onto the truck in the parking structure and pointed handguns at him. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the guards heard footsteps, turned around and saw the guys with guns 
coming toward him," Gabor said. "(The robbers) fired, and the guard returned 
fire. He then found cover."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTIES BREAK UP ILLEGAL RODEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An illegal rodeo that reportedly included bullfighting was shut down by 
sheriff's deputies who discovered it in Saugus while investigating a parking 
complaint, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 participants and spectators were dispersed from a ranch in San 
Francisquito Canyon Sunday afternoon, Sgt. David Stunson said. Deputies 
stumbled on to the rodeo, which had no county permit for a public assembly, 
when answering a report that so many cars were parked in the area that a 
driveway shared by nearby ranches was partially blocked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
County animal control officers were also called to the scene when deputies 
noticed that several horses and steers used in the rodeo competition appeared 
to be malnourished and injured. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican rodeo, or charreada, events had been staged on Sundays at the ranch in 
the 29300 block of San Francisquito Canyon Road for nearly a year, according to 
neighbors. But authorities said the Sheriff's Department was unaware of the 
activity until deputies received the call on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to not having an assembly permit, the rodeo had improper emergency 
access and lacked fire protection equipment, Stunson said. There were 
inadequate restroom facilities and the health department will be asked to 
determine whether food and beverage preparation at the rodeo was sanitary, he 
said.

<P>
Parents of students at Russell Elementary School in Los Angeles defended the 
school Monday against accusations that it is located in a "gang-infested 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
They said parents of Cudahy's Park Avenue School have been saying publicly that 
they will fear for their children's lives when the youngsters are transferred 
this week from their closed school to Russell. 
</P>
<P>
Park Avenue School was closed last week to allow for an investigation of a 
mysterious, oily substance oozing onto the school's playground. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities ordered the school closed and transferred the 1,100 pupils enrolled 
at the year-round facility to Russell, which normally is operated on a 
nine-month school year.

4 ALLEGED 'SKINHEADS' MISLABELED, HEARING TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendora couple testified in court Monday that four people who looked like 
"skinheads" assaulted them in a supermarket parking lot last May after one of 
the men with a shaved head screamed "White Power! White Rule!" 
</P>
<P>
But a lawyer for one of the four called the encounter "just a parking-lot 
argument" and said they had been mislabeled as "skinheads." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came on the opening day of a preliminary hearing for Scott Robert 
Wilson, 28, of West Covina; Timothy Robert Zaal, 25, of Glendora; William 
Killackey, 21, of Yorba Linda and Killackey's sister, Amy, 19, of West Covina. 
All four are charged with felony assault and violation of the state's civil 
rights law in connection with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is being held after failing to post bail. The other three are free on 
$50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Manochehr Sadri said he was inside a supermarket in La Verne on a Sunday 
afternoon in May when a man at the entrance raised his right arm and screamed: 
"White Power! White Rule!" 
</P>
<P>
Sadri testified at Pomona Municipal Court Monday that he and his wife then left 
the market, but the four continued to scream racial epithets at them near the 
store entrance. As he and his wife were pushing a shopping cart and their 
2-month-old baby through the parking lot toward their car, the group followed 
and accosted them near the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speaking Persian 
</P>
<P>
Sadri, 30, and his wife, Farzaneh, 28, told the court that they were speaking 
in Persian when they heard themselves being mocked. One of the men, Mrs. Sadri 
said, "was making fun of our accent," and apparently thought they were Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
She said one man made an anti-Semitic remark about her child. 
</P>
<P>
The name-calling, the husband and wife testified, led to an assault in which he 
was kicked and beaten and she was punched in the face. Manochehr Sadri suffered 
minor injuries in the alleged attack. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Ted Meeder, who represents Zaal, said the defendants have been 
mislabeled as neo-Nazi skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
He said Zaal, whom Manochehr Sadri identified as the man who shouted "White 
Power! White Rule!" is not a member of any political group. "It was just a 
parking-lot argument," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Meeder said the defendants had stopped at the store to get some food for a 
barbecue after attending a benefit concert for the homeless at which they had 
picked up some "White Power" cards that were being passed out. 
</P>
<P>
In court Monday, two of the defendants wore business suits and short-cropped 
hair. The lone female defendant wore a navy blue dress. 
</P>
<P>
But Manochehr Sadri said the defendants were dressed much differently during 
the encounter. Two of the men were shirtless and had tattoos, he testified, and 
all wore their hair so short that it appeared their heads had been shaved. Mrs. 
Sadri said Amy Killackey and Wilson wore what appeared to be "combat boots." 
</P>
<P>
Manochehr Sadri said the assault began when Wilson attempted to kick him. Sadri 
said he grabbed Wilson's leg and both men ended up on the ground, struggling 
for eight or nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kicked, Punched 
</P>
<P>
During the scuffle, he was repeatedly kicked and hit on the head, Sadri said. 
Meanwhile, Mrs. Sadri testified that one of the assailants hit her with his 
open hand as she was screaming. 
</P>
<P>
Manochehr Sadri said that Leonard Washington, a school security guard, 
intervened to try to help him but the struggle continued until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony at the hearing will continue today.

NEW U.S. CHARGES ARE FILED AGAINST TWO PALESTINIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two-and-a-half years after they were arrested and jailed for alleged 
subversion, the Justice Department has filed new charges against two Los 
Angeles-area Palestinians, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney disclosed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"At the 11th hour, the government has filed new charges against our clients in 
a last-ditch attempt to bolster its faltering case," said Paul Hoffman, legal 
director of the ACLU's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
Like the original case, the new charges in Immigration Court are being brought 
under the McCarthy-era McCarran-Walter Act, and are designed to deport the 
aliens, Khader Hamide, 35, of Los Angeles, and Michel Shehadeh, 33, of Long 
Beach. No criminal charges were ever filed against them. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said the government charged Hamide and Shehadeh with "membership in, or 
affiliation with, an organization that advocates or teaches the duty or 
necessity or propriety of the unlawful assaulting or killing of government 
officials." 
</P>
<P>
The organization referred to by the government is the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, an affiliate of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
The PFLP has a history of terrorist activities overseas and in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Steps In 
</P>
<P>
Last December, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson overturned the 
McCarran-Walter Act's political provisions under which Hamide and Shehadeh were 
charged, declaring them unconstitutional. The government has appealed to the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, their immigration cases were placed on hold by U.S. Immigration 
Judge Ingrid K. Hrycenko until the federal appeal is decided. Hrycenko's 
decision to delay the deportation hearings also was appealed by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, however, did not have before him the new charges, which were 
transmitted to the immigrants' lawyers last Friday night by federal attorney 
James A. Hunolt, a member of the Justice Department's Washington team 
prosecuting Hamide and Shehadeh. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman contends, however, that the new charges are no different than the old 
ones, and simply came from a paragraph in the McCarran-Walter Act preceding the 
sections that Wilson declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An End Run' 
</P>
<P>
Another lawyer for the aliens, Marc Van Der Hout of San Francisco, said this 
maneuver amounts to a ploy by the government to circumvent the decision by 
Wilson, who declared that aliens have the same free speech rights as American 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"This essentially is a desperate attempt on the government's part to do an end 
run around the clear ruling of the district court," Van Der Hout said. 
</P>
<P>
Government prosecutors could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hamide and Shehadeh -- along with five other Palestinians and a Kenyan -- were 
arrested in January, 1987, and jailed for about two weeks on subversion 
allegations under the McCarran-Walter Act, a law that has been used to deport 
or exclude aliens deemed undesirable. At that time, they were accused of 
advocating world communism, totalitarian dictatorship and the unlawful 
destruction of property. 
</P>
<P>
All eight, who then faced deportation proceedings, denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Washington subsequently changed the subversion allegations against Hamide and 
Shehadeh, alleging that they advocated "the unlawful damage, injury or 
destruction of property" under another McCarran-Walter section. The new charges 
are in addition to this, immigration attorney Van Der Hout said. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the aliens facing visa violations have since received, in effect, 
waivers to remain in the United States. But three others still face visa 
violation action. Their cases are scheduled to continue today in Hrycenko's 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Today's immigration proceeding almost certainly will serve as a forum for the 
immigrants' lawyers to ask Justice Department attorneys why the new allegations 
were filed, Van Der Hout said.

POSTSCRIPT: 'THERE WAS NO EFFECTIVE METHOD OF DEALING WITH THE UNPAID TICKETS 
UNTIL THE BOOTING PROGRAM CAME INTO BEING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In April of 1987, Los Angeles traffic control officers began attaching a 
clamp-like device known as the Boot on vehicles they found with multiple unpaid 
parking tickets on record. 
</P>
<P>
Booting cars was chosen by a frustrated city Department of Transportation as a 
way to chisel away at a massive, $100-million backlog of parking fines, city 
Parking Administrator Robert Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, parking violators in Los Angeles still abound, even with the 
advent of the Boot. The number of Boot-eligible vehicles on file -- those with 
five or more outstanding tickets -- has grown from 65,000 to about 95,000, said 
Kaye Beechum, city parking enforcement manager. 
</P>
<P>
But given the rise in parking violators in Los Angeles, the 85% collection 
ratio on fines now is an improvement from pre-boot years, when about half of 
all parking tickets issued would not be paid, Beechum said. 
</P>
<P>
The Boot, introduced in Denver and now common in many cities, is fixed onto the 
car's front wheel, preventing it from moving. Drivers finding their vehicles 
fitted with the contraption have three days to pay all their outstanding 
parking tickets, plus a $35 booting fee, or the vehicle is towed and the 
recovery fees rise to at least $50, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,273,688 parking tickets have been issued in the city in the last year, 
Beechum said. That's 488 every hour. 
</P>
<P>
In just two years, the Boot has been slapped onto 21,781 cars. Of those, about 
12,000 have been retrieved by their reproachful owners, Beechum said. Unclaimed 
vehicles are sold for lien, to pay off their owner's parking debts and the cost 
of booting, towing and storing. Any car sale profit goes back into the budget 
that supports the Department of Motor Vehicles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a start," Beechum said. "There was no effective method of dealing with 
the unpaid tickets until the booting program came into being." 
</P>
<P>
These days 70 to 80 cars a day are clamped by a dozen city-employed traffic 
officers who are assigned solely to work on the Boot beat. Fitters roam the 
city streets, concentrating on areas where chronically illegal cars and Boot 
candidates are reported by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"The booting unit is kind of an elite group," Beechum said. "They enjoy 
catching these violators and everyone in the department appreciates their 
actions. It gives encouragement to other officers to know that tickets they are 
writing are going to get paid." 
</P>
<P>
The booting unit has an arsenal of about 400 boots -- which cost $350 each -- 
beefed up from the original 200 the program began with, she said. The devices 
used in Los Angeles are made by Palma Auto-Boot of Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Since the program started, 219 boots have been stolen or destroyed, Beecham 
said. "The assumption is, before the city could get to the booted car, owners 
towed it to a secluded location and the boots were cut or pried off," she said. 
In addition, at least one boot-related scam has caught some used-car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Escaped vehicles -- those which have had the Boot removed illegally -- have 
been sold to unsuspecting buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"The victim buys the car, the tickets -- and the fact that the car was booted," 
Beechum said. She advised people planning to buy a used car to check the 
vehicle's ticketing status with the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
Beechum said the rise in the ticket collection rate, which nets the city about 
$1.7 million per year, does more than make up for the headaches that come with 
pilfered boots. 
</P>
<P>
She added that the fear factor is the main reason why the booting program has 
been effective. 
</P>
<P>
"The psychological impact is what gets people to respond to paying the fines," 
she said. "Having it out there, where everyone in the neighborhood can see. . . 
. I imagine it's pretty embarrassing." JOHN H. LEE

'RAISED RIGHT';

<P>
BEBE MOORE CAMPBELL'S LOVING MEMOIR EVOKES THE IMPORTANCE OF A FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ITABARI NJERI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She does not believe in playing the lottery. She does not believe in playing 
the numbers. And writer Bebe Moore Campbell never dreamed that John Beresford 
Tipton would send Mr. Anthony with a check to her door in "The Millionaire." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ambitious," Campbell affirms with a nod of her head and a stiffening of 
her slender body that suggests flesh hung on steel. She always knew she would 
have to get what she wanted by her own sweat. And no one in her family was ever 
afraid of hard work, least of all her daddy, George Moore. 
</P>
<P>
There also was a steeliness about him -- literal and metaphoric. He was a 
paraplegic who never let distance, divorce or his paralysis keep him away from 
his only child. In his wheelchair, the young Bebe thought of her dad as the 
"black Ironside." 
</P>
<P>
It is the story of their seasons together in North Carolina, "Sweet Summer, 
Growing Up With and Without My Dad," a widely praised memoir by Campbell, that 
has the author's phone jingling off the kitchen wall. 
</P>
<P>
All the sweat is paying off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bid for Film Rights 
</P>
<P>
"That's my agent. The paperback auction for the book is going on right now," 
says Campbell, who admits that she has been a little edgy all day waiting to 
hear the results of the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
But that's just her New York literary agent. Beth Swofford, her agent with the 
William Morris Agency in Los Angeles, is in negotiations with Motown 
Productions and the Michael Douglas company for the film rights to "Sweet 
Summer." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, she's waiting for the best deal, Campbell says. "I don't care who 
does it, as long as it's a quality production." But she already knows the actor 
she wants to play her dad. "Danny Glover," she answers instantly but flatly. 
</P>
<P>
She's obviously given the starring role much thought, probably daydreamed the 
entire screenplay. But she seems almost afraid to admit -- at least to a 
stranger -- her excitement. 
</P>
<P>
At 39, she is the mother of two with a teen-ager's figure and the intense and 
weary gaze of an ancient. She is a free-lance journalist, too, and that may 
account for the look in her eyes -- most reporters develop a protective 
cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, when her first short story appeared in Essence magazine, Campbell 
has been prolific, turning out articles for the New York Times magazine, the 
Christian Science Monitor, Working Mother, SAVVY and Essence, for whom she is 
also a contributing editor. In 1986, her first book was published, "Successful 
Women, Angry Men -- Backlash in the Two-Career Marriage." 
</P>
<P>
The word from her literary agent comes in: Ballantine Books has bought the 
paperback rights to the book, though, after some discussion, she decides it 
would be "tacky" to say for how much. In a later interview, her agent says the 
book was bought for "double" what the publisher expected, a figure in the "high 
five" digits. 
</P>
<P>
Then, word comes that Motown Productions has optioned the film rights to the 
book for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
While Campbell, who is married to a Los Angeles banker, says her personal 
finances are improving, she's nowhere near megabuck status -- yet. "Sweet 
Summer" is not on the best-seller list and film rights are bought and sold 
every day -- often without the movie ever being made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Story Strikes a Nerve 
</P>
<P>
But Campbell's gentle, poignant story about her relationship with her father 
has struck a nerve. She's been on "Today"; she's done "Sonya Live"; she's been 
on radio talk shows all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because people are hungry for positive images about the black family and 
black fathers in particular, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Poet Nikki Giovanni, now a professor of English at Virginia Polytechnic 
University, called "Sweet Summer" "one of the more overdue books about and for 
the black community" in her review for the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's father, George Linwood Peter Moore, was crippled in an automobile 
accident when his daughter was 10 months old. He lived at his mother's home in 
Elizabeth City, N.C., and every June went to Philadelphia to get Bebe to "take 
her to summer." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, he was killed, in another car accident. And with his death, Campbell 
writes, she lost "those men who used to entice me with their story telling, 
yank my plaits, throw me quarters and tell me what a pretty girl I was. . . . 
My father took to his grave the short-sleeved, beer-swilling men of summer, big 
bellies, raucous laughter, pipe smoke and the aroma of cigars. My daddy is 
really gone and his vacant place is my cold, hard border. As always, my life is 
framed by his absence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crucial Message 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the crucial message in her book -- one still not fully understood by 
society, Campbell says -- is the importance of a father or a father-figure in a 
young girl's life. 
</P>
<P>
"Studies show that girls without that nurturing from a father or surrogate 
father are likely to grow up with damaged self-esteem and are more likely to 
have problems with their own adult relationships with men," Campbell says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important at this time for black people to see that there 
are fathers, despite divorce, that stuck around and were responsible. We know 
in the black community, or come to expect, that mothers stick around and are 
responsible. And it's not that I don't give my mother credit for doing that. I 
do. But it's very important at this point that we can look at some black male 
images that we can be proud of and to inspire some men who aren't doing what 
they are supposed to be doing." 
</P>
<P>
The increasingly high rates of divorce, late marriage or no marriage among all 
Americans, but among blacks in particular, give credence to Campbell's 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Center for Afro-American Studies at UCLA held a conference on the 
decline of marriage among African Americans. A conference report found that the 
long-established pre-1950 pattern of blacks marrying earlier than whites is 
ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
"Between 1975 and 1985, the proportion of women who had ever married declined 
sharply from nearly 80% to 65% among blacks," compared with 89% to 82% among 
whites. There was no change in the figure of 81% for Latinas. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of women who were divorced increased from 22% to 31% for black 
women, compared with 18% to 27% among whites, and only 18% to 20% for Latino 
women. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s and 1940s, more than 90% of black men and women married, according 
to the conference report. But for a younger generation of Americans, at least 
90% of white males and females born in 1954 are expected to marry by their 45th 
birthday, compared with 86% of black males but only 70% of black females. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Black Family Structure 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, these changes are dramatic and would seemingly portend a significant 
shift in the basic structure of the black American community and family," the 
conference report said. "Among the more discussed consequences of these trends 
include an increase in the number of female-headed households with no male head 
(and) an increased burden of child-rearing being place on women." 
</P>
<P>
When Campbell takes questions about her book on television and radio shows, she 
hears the voices of these statistics. Some of them are "absentee fathers with 
whom the black community needs to find some creative ways of reaching out . . . 
to open up a dialogue. Some of these guys who call are asking for help. They 
are saying things like 'I haven't seen my kid, but I'm not a bad father' -- 
because they don't want to be labeled that. But they don't know how to be a 
good one." 
</P>
<P>
Right away, she tells them she's not an expert. But she suggests that they 
write to their children. Or "one of the things you can do is drop off groceries 
or clothing for your child." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the fathers are so angry with their former wives that they don't 
want to give them checks "because they think she's going to spend it on some 
man." 
</P>
<P>
But a father can pay a baby sitter directly or give money directly to a doctor 
for bills or pay for the music lessons. "If you are serious about being in your 
child's life," she tells them, "you can find a way. If a judge said you are 
supposed to pay $200 a month in child support, you can find $200 worth of bills 
that specifically involve the child. You don't even have to hand the money to 
your ex-wife. If men do this consistently -- and I don't mean to sound like a 
Pollyanna, because I know a lot of them won't do this -- but if they do, I 
can't see too many women remaining angry when a man is taking care of their 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Spoken like the social worker she once wanted to be. Her mother is a retired 
social worker. Campbell, who majored in elementary education, graduated summa 
cum laude from the University of Pittsburgh. Several years later, she married a 
childhood sweetheart. The marriage ended in divorce. When that happened she 
said to herself, "Gee, what is this, a legacy . . . of divorce I've been handed 
down?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coping With Divorce 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter, Maia, now 12, was 3 1/2 at the time her parents separated. She 
was very "angry," Campbell says. "She acted out and let me know that she was 
unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
When her daughter reached the second grade, Campbell asked the school 
psychologist for help. "The psychologist formed a group of about four or five 
children . . . who were coping with divorce. And that really helped her a lot. 
They just came together and talked out some feelings that maybe she wasn't 
letting me know. I began to see a change in her." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's first husband and her daughter have "a loving relationship." And her 
daughter is "very close" to her stepfather, Ellis Gordon Jr. The author also 
has a stepson from her marriage to Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best thing her husband does "is help Maia see, in a way that I 
could not show her myself, what a good marriage is supposed to look like. And 
how a man is supposed to treat a woman. He is the person who will be 
responsible for her expectations as to how she will be treated as a wife." 
</P>
<P>
Her childhood memoir, like so many, is a prelude for the next phase in 
Campbell's career as a writer: "My next book is a novel," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what else her plans includes, she hesitates, "I'm trying to decide how 
much I want to tell." She is silent for seconds, sifting her private thoughts. 
One wonders with whom, besides herself, is she silently communing? 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, she reveals that in the midst of all the success surrounding her book, 
there have been deaths in recent weeks: a friend, an aunt and uncle. 
</P>
<P>
In the empty space, the closing words to "Sweet Summer" seem appropriate: 
</P>
<P>
"But I am lonely. . . . No strong hands reach out to boost me in ways that I 
was lifted before. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Long ago I realized that love is all that is required of fatherhood, that love 
will spark the action that it takes to mold a child. I have grown strong and 
whole from the blessings of my many fathers. Everything they gave me -- 
roughness, gruffness, awkward gentleness, the contrast to my female world, 
their love -- is as much a part of me as my bones, my blood. I was given a rich 
and privileged childhood, an American childhood, a solid foundation on which to 
stand and, yes, even go forward. I was guided by good men, powerful men. I was 
raised right."

Imaginary Landscape: Making Worlds of Myth and Science by William Irwin 
Thompson (St. Martin's Press: $19.95; 191 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Radical thought is fundamentally different from liberal thought. The two do not 
lie on the same continuum. You don't get more and more and more liberal until 
suddenly you are radical. Radicalism is discontinuous with other viewpoints. It 
requires a sharp break with them, and it lives on the other side of that 
divide. 
</P>
<P>
By this definition, "Imaginary Landscape" by William Irwin Thompson is a 
radical book. Not in a political sense, but as a way of thought. As Thompson 
tells us at several points, he sees the world differently than almost everybody 
else. That is both the strength and the weakness of his book. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Unique View 
</P>
<P>
It is the strength because Thompson is operating from a unique world view, 
which in itself is very attractive. He is his own person. It is the weakness of 
the book because try as I might I can't understand what he's talking about. 
</P>
<P>
This much I get: Thompson, a cultural historian who has taught at various 
universities in this country, opposes the standard impersonal, scientific view 
of the world, which he decries as "scientific materialism." He writes: 
</P>
<P>
"An art gallery in which all the paintings were mirrors would be boring, and so 
would a world with only one reflection of existence. There is not simply one 
objective world, one fixed ground with adequate representations of it in mind; 
there are multiple worlds in an ecology of multiple biomes (sic) and organisms, 
each constituting cognitive domains of fascinating richness. Those who can live 
with ambiguity, complexity, and infinite variety can rejoice that there are 
windows to different worlds in the cognition of an antibody, a bee, a dolphin, 
a bird, a human, an elemental or an angel." 
</P>
<P>
I'm willing to grant that bees, dolphins, birds and humans have different 
cognitive experiences. But antibodies? And angels? (I pass over elementals as 
I'm not sure what they are.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Science and Myth 
</P>
<P>
Thompson goes on to tell us that myth-making is what culture is all about, and 
science is as much a part of the myth as Grimm's Fairy Tales. "Before we can 
ever be open to the scientific imagination of the future," he says, "we have to 
be open to the imagination in the mythologies and arts of the past. If we look 
on myth as gibberish and art as illusion, our science will be brutal and will 
brutalize others in the inappropriate organization of our social institutions." 
</P>
<P>
I'm serious when I say I like his way of thinking. The world could do with more 
intellectual anarchists. They liven things up. So what if you wind up 
scratching your head in puzzlement? Better than reading the same old things, 
the same perspective, the same givens, the same accepted wisdom that together 
makes up a culture. Doesn't everybody on MacNeil/Lehrer sound the same, 
regardless of his political point of view? 
</P>
<P>
Thompson would never be mistaken for one of them. He is on the other side of 
the chasm that separates liberalism thought from radicalism. This guy may be on 
to something. I wish I knew what. 
</P>
<P>
"In the rise of secular modernism," he writes, "we moved away from 
traditionally religious modes of thought to see matter as dead and mind as 
divorced from nature. Now in the shift from European modernism to a planetary 
culture, we see that that ideology was too simplistic, that there are 
intriguing relationships between myth and science and that animism contains 
some intuitive insights that are worth exploring in the differing ways of art, 
science, and philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
All of this leads to what Thompson calls "a cultural history of consciousness" 
in which he traces the development of group thought through five historical 
stages from culture to "planetization," which is where we are now. 
</P>
<P>
I would summarize some of his arguments but I fear that I would misrepresent 
them. In general I don't have much patience for books I don't understand. But 
there's something about this book that leads me to think that this time the 
fault is mine and not the author's. Perhaps I'm getting soft (or soft-headed) 
with age. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson concludes: 
</P>
<P>
"Between the angelic heights of the macrocosm of the Gaian atmosphere and the 
elemental depths of the microcosm of the bacterial earth lies the middle way of 
the Mind, and it is in this imaginary landscape of the middle way, whether we 
call it the Madhyamika of Buddhism or the Christ of Steiner or the Da at of the 
Kabbalah, that we humans take our life and come to know our world as the dark 
horizon that illuminates our hidden center."

CRITIC AT LARGE: WINERIES UNCORK A FILM FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PETALUMA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are international film festivals (Cannes, Berlin), national film 
festivals (Chicago, Los Angeles) and there are local film festivals. Very 
local. 
</P>
<P>
On a cloudless, breezy Saturday morning, a knot of two or three dozen people, 
sitting on blankets or folding chairs, are gathered in one corner of Petaluma's 
pretty, shady Walnut Park to discuss screenwriting. Petaluma also hosts the 
national wrist-wrestling championship and a celebrated ugly dog contest; the 
movies fit right in. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the park, a local cycle club is gathering for its weekly sprint; 
kids are playing, dogs are chasing about, drifters with bedrolls are catching 
some sun-warmed Zs. 
</P>
<P>
An oil-cloth banner stretched between trees declares the third annual Wine 
Country Film Festival to be in session. The other park people are regarding the 
film folk with benign indifference. 
</P>
<P>
Local film festivals survive, if they do, on volunteerism, forgiveness and an 
indefatigable love of the movies on the part of participants and consumers. 
Survival is not easy. After two seasons, the Monterey Film Festival drowned 
last year in a sea of red ink reportedly $250,000 deep. 
</P>
<P>
The Wine Country festival, organized by Steven Ashton and partially funded by a 
coalition of local wineries, operates on a shoestring that is frayed even as 
shoestrings go. A local paper, the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat last week reported 
grumblings of discontent from firms that supported the festival previously but, 
for various reasons, no longer do, or will. There are moments when the festival 
appears to proceed by improvisation, loping from crisis to crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But, with continuing support from American Airlines, the Red Lion Inn and other 
suppliers as well as the wineries, the festival manages to do what a local 
festival ought to do, which is bring to town films and videos that, for the 
most part, would not otherwise be visible within miles, maybe hundreds of 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
This year's festival was evenly divided between Healdsburg, where the 
excellent, imaginatively programmed Raven Theatre was the principal venue, and 
Petaluma, where the Palace Theatre, which had been dark in recent weeks, was 
the major site. 
</P>
<P>
The offerings were as varied as "When Harry Met Sally . . .," the current hit 
that was the opening-night film, and "Bloodhounds of Broadway," the closing 
film, which is based on some Damon Runyon short stories and stars Rutger Hauer 
and Julie Hagerty in a large cast. "Bloodhounds," made on a minimal budget, is 
said to have been the last project OK'd by David Puttnam before he left 
Columbia. The studio's release plans for it are still uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
The other offerings included "sex, lies and videotapes," the smash success and 
Gold Palm winner at Cannes, and "The Raggedy Rawney," the remarkable anti-war 
fable that Bob Hoskins ("Pennies From Heaven") wrote and directed and in which 
he acts. 
</P>
<P>
The luminous guests included Michael York, who came with "Heat of the Day," a 
World War II thriller in which he stars with Peggy Ashcroft, Patricia Hodge and 
Michael Gambon ("The Singing Detective"). Oscar-nominee Sally Kirkland gave a 
very lively acting workshop that even attracted Petaluma's peppy mayor, M. 
Patricia Hilligoss, who in one of the exercises was persuaded to sing "On a 
Clear Day" as if she were Barbra Streisand. It was a smash. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Redgrave appeared with "Death of a Son," a co-production she did for BBC 
television, which aired it early in the year to phenomenal ratings, and Center 
Films, which is still negotiating for American distribution. 
</P>
<P>
It is based on the true story of Pauline Williams, whose son died of a drug 
injection administered by a user-pusher friend. The government refused to 
prosecute. After a four-year struggle, Williams, who had never finished the 
equivalent of high school, amassed enough medical lore to discover an error in 
the inquest findings and launch Britain's first successful private prosecution 
for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was slashed by a drug-thug for her efforts but has become a national 
heroine. Redgrave's performance is beyond question her most unforgettable since 
"Georgy Girl" nearly a quarter-century ago. Home from the inquest, she stands 
at the kitchen stove, back to the camera, moaning like a wounded animal. 
</P>
<P>
It a moment of extraordinary intensity; it is also the bottom of an arc that 
takes her from black defeat, despair, anger, rising curiosity, frustration 
(always frustration), renewed determination and a damn-the-bureaucrats drive 
and that leads ultimately to triumphs tentative and then total. 
</P>
<P>
"Death of a Son" is a first feature for director Ross Devenish and scriptwriter 
Tony Marchant, and I hope it finds its way to American audiences because it has 
the doubled power of reality as art; and it affirms, from reality, the scarce 
but welcome truth that one person can still make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its financial and administrative problems, a festival, if it works at 
all, is its own kind of affirmation of the impact and the rewards of film.

RIGHT TIME, BIG CITY FOR CONDUCTOR JARVI? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine years and 150 recordings ago, Neeme Jarvi was virtually unknown in this 
country, while a musical hero in his native Estonia. There, he received an 
honorary doctorate from the conservatory in Tallinn, where his portrait hung in 
a museum. 
</P>
<P>
Now he conducts orchestras around the world and is considered a potential heir 
to Andre Previn at the Los Angeles Philharmonic. But that portrait, he is told, 
has been banished to a lavatory, the result of Jarvi becoming a non-person when 
he and his family immigrated to the United States in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a funny thing, that situation," Jarvi says with a laugh. "Here I am 
talking with the President, while in Estonia my picture is in a restroom!" 
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old conductor spoke briefly Friday with President Bush, at a 
meeting calling attention to Captive Nations Week, and later taped a talk for 
his compatriots for Voice of America. 
</P>
<P>
Jarvi took his opportunity to get the President's ear in a characteristic way. 
"I just gave him a recording, Estonian Music Vol. I." 
</P>
<P>
Jarvi's White House visit postponed a Los Angeles rehearsal. The conductor 
leads the Philharmonic and the Philharmonic Institute Orchestra in a concert at 
Hollywood Bowl tonight. He is at the head of a long parade of guest conductors 
who may be contenders for the Philharmonic music director post. 
</P>
<P>
On the program is Sibelius' Second Symphony, which Jarvi did with the 
Philharmonic at the Music Center in May for the final concerts of the season. 
He was replacing at short notice Previn, who said he was suffering a shoulder 
ailment. 
</P>
<P>
That timely appearance, in addition to other factors such as his distinguished 
discography, put Jarvi's name on many lists of potential successors to Previn. 
Though interested in the position, the conductor says he doesn't think much of 
his chances, citing a lack of charisma. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I am the right person for this orchestra. It is very near 
Hollywood, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic also needs some extra special 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a very attractive person, I am a professional person. I can make 
great results from any orchestra. But I don't think they are very much 
interested in me. In our day, it must be a great name, a star. It doesn't 
matter much how good (the candidate is), but it must be a star. And I'm not a 
star kind of person." 
</P>
<P>
Jarvi is equally gloomy about his prospects for the New York Philharmonic 
directorship, and he does indeed want an American orchestra. He is, however, 
also very loyal to Gothenburg, Sweden, where he is principal conductor. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to America, but a lot of orchestras didn't propose for me a job," Jarvi 
says. "But they (Gothenburg) did, and that was the start of my career. When I 
came to the Western world, nobody knew much about me. I had to start from zero, 
and here I am now with my 150 records. If you go to this Western world, you 
have to work hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I didn't go to the right place at the right time, with the right 
repertoire. My repertoire is strange, a little bit. People are looking always 
for very popular repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the Philadelphia Orchestra with the Tchaikovsky Third Symphony, and 
to Boston with Tubin Symphony No. 5. You can't show very much with the 
orchestra if the orchestra does not know the piece and has limited rehearsal. 
Finally, my English at that time was not very good." 
</P>
<P>
As a music maker, Jarvi is indefatigable, making 20 to 25 records a year. Many 
of these are of lesser-known music from northern Europe and the Soviet Union, 
including symphonic cycles from Estonian composer Eduard Tubin, the Dane Niels 
Gade, and Glazunov. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my duty is to introduce more unusual music to the musicians and the 
musical world. Because to do always the same repertoire is some sign of 
weakness, of narrowness, of conductors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that recordings are the best way to show an orchestra and make it 
better known in the musical world. . . . Its not actually my main thing, to 
make records, but it's happened that way." 
</P>
<P>
Does he worry about being typecast as a Nordic specialist? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but who else is doing it?" Jarvi asks. "I'm a Nordic person, and I feel 
very much at home in Scandinavian music -- I don't think (Italian conductor 
Riccardo) Muti is going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Jarvi is also well-represented in more conventional repertory. He 
has recorded Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak and Prokofiev cycles as well as the 
more esoteric things. 
</P>
<P>
All of this seems like a tremendous output, laid down in less than six years. 
But Jarvi points out that his recording spree is the product of a lifetime's 
work and study. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I'm not so young anymore. I studied these scores when I was much 
younger, now I'm just looking them over, and so I don't think it's necessary 
too much to work. Learning scores, it doesn't take very much time for me." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jarvi has his orchestra in Sweden, and was music director of the 
Scottish National Orchestra for four years, he is busiest in this country, 
constantly engaged as a guest conductor. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had two orchestras in Europe, it was hard to be free for American 
orchestras in the future, and I'm looking to have an American orchestra," Jarvi 
says. "But I'm going to select that carefully. I have time for that. I don't 
know when it's going to happen, or where its going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"But still, I want to create the same way, to make that orchestra really known, 
in America and the world. To take similar record projects and tourings, and 
interesting repertoire policy." 
</P>
<P>
That orchestra's repertory would include American music. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed," Jarvi says. "Why don't American conductors do American composers? 
Everyone plays Gershwin, everyone plays Copland, maybe Ives, and then 
Bernstein. And that's it. There are hundreds of American composers that need 
introduction to the musical world, even to America. 
</P>
<P>
"But nobody plays American music. They hire European conductors, American 
orchestras, and they are coming again with Beethoven-Brahms, Beethoven-Brahms, 
Bruckner-Mahler, Bruckner-Mahler, and then Beethoven-Brahms, and that's the way 
it goes always. Boring!" 
</P>
<P>
In that context, it might be noted that Jarvi's second concert with the 
Philharmonic at Hollywood Bowl -- not a combination renowned for unusual 
programming -- is a Beethoven-Brahms agenda. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Jarvi will make his return to Estonia, at the head of his 
Gothenburg orchestra. Every week he is somewhere else for concerts and 
recordings, ranging from the Chicago Symphony to the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam 
around to orchestras in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
This gypsy life keeps him away from his family much of the time. His three 
children are all musicians, however, with whom Jarvi sometimes collaborates 
professionally. Maarika, a flutist, and Kristian, a pianist, gave a concert 
Saturday evening at the home of Philharmonic director Richard Colburn, where 
Jarvi is staying during this engagement. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year is changing," Jarvi says, and wide-ranging variety is something he 
tries to create in his career. "I can't do everything -- but I try."

ARTS ADMINISTRATORS: THE COST OF CALLING THE TUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas R. Kendrick, president of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, and 
his wife, Judith O'Dea Morr, the center's general manager, are among the 
highest-paid administrators of multipurpose arts facilities in the nation, with 
combined compensation and benefits of more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Individually as well as collectively, Kendrick and Morr's paychecks and other 
compensations rank just behind those of the two highest-paid administrators at 
New York's Lincoln Center and ahead of those at the Music Center of Los Angeles 
County and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, 
according to a survey by the Times' Orange County Edition. 
</P>
<P>
This is despite the fact that of the seven facilities surveyed, the Orange 
County center has the fewest stages and ranks near the bottom of the list in 
the number of paid, ticketed performances per season and the number of 
full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
Francis L. Dale, who served until June of 1988 as president of the Los Angeles 
Music Center, was listed as earning $175,000 a year with no benefits package, 
according to the most recent information filed with the California Registry of 
Charitable Trusts in Sacramento. Esther Wachtell, who served as executive vice 
president until she succeeded Dale, was listed at $75,000 a year. She has been 
replaced in that position by James Black, whose salary is not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick and Morr say they are fairly compensated, and center board members say 
that at the amount Kendrick and Morr are paid, they are a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Information filed with the Internal Revenue Service and the California Registry 
of Charitable Trusts, required for all tax-exempt organizations, indicates that 
Kendrick was paid $184,246 in 1988 and received a benefits package worth an 
additional $6,543, primarily for an annuity plan. Morr, who came to Orange 
County with Kendrick from Washington, where both worked as top administrators 
at the Kennedy Center for nearly a decade, is the second-highest-paid staff 
member at the Orange County center, reporting earnings of $108,678 and a 
benefits package of $3,749 for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At the centers surveyed, none of the job descriptions for the top two 
administrative slots precisely mirrored Kendrick and Morr's. In principle, all 
chief executives are responsible for everything that goes on in their 
institutions. But according to Kendrick, this is almost literally true for 
himself and Morr in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of the other executives surveyed, Kendrick said, the couple is 
responsible for day-to-day programming, administration, coordination with such 
regional groups as the Pacific Symphony and Opera Pacific, finance and budget 
controls, construction planning and supervision, marketing and media relations. 
(This despite their staff that includes a director of marketing, a director of 
development and a controller.) 
</P>
<P>
Also on the couple's list of responsibilities is fund raising, which now means 
presiding over a greatly expanded development department and an ambitious 
capital campaign to construct new theaters. 
</P>
<P>
At Lincoln Center, although the operating budget is more than twice that of the 
Orange County center, president Nathan Leventhal is primarily responsible for 
day-to-day operations of the six-theater complex. Leventhal earned $205,865 and 
received a benefits package of $20,785 in 1988 for a total of $226,650, 
according to documents filed with the State of New York. Financing is handled 
by Donald Warner, one of the center's six vice presidents and the 
second-highest paid administrator, who earned $108,765 and received benefits 
worth $14,750, totaling $123,515. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Davidson, chairman of the Kennedy Center, oversees programming, 
fund-raising and administration. He is paid $125,000 per year and provided with 
a car, according to Laura Longley, the center's director of public affairs. He 
succeeded Roger Stevens, who took no salary. Much of the actual programming is 
done by Marta Istomin, the center's artistic director, whose 1988 salary has 
not yet been filed with the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
The two administrators who come closest to Kendrick and Morr in the range of 
day-to-day responsibilities are Lawrence J. Wilker and Art Falco at Playhouse 
Square Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Their combined compensation for 1988 was 
$213,230 -- $89,986 less than Kendrick and Morr's combined total. 
</P>
<P>
But the size of the compensation packages is misleading, Kendrick and Morr said 
in separate interviews, because the figures encompass such things as pro-rated 
moving and housing compensation and "significant" out-of-pocket contributions 
to disability, health and retirement plans to maintain the generous level of 
coverage they were provided at the Kennedy Center (but which is no longer 
provided to administrators there). 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're fairly paid," Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Morr said that she, too, is "quite comfortable with my level of compensation." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't move here for pay," but for the challenge of building and shaping a 
new institution, Kendrick added. He also said he prefers to be judged "on the 
basis of the jobs we were brought here to do, and the jobs we have done." 
</P>
<P>
On that basis, Center board members agree that the couple's compensation is not 
out of line. 
</P>
<P>
By many standards used to judge such facilities, center officials and board 
members said, the center is a success: it has reached what they consider to be 
"full bookings" three years ahead of schedule (center officials say that 
virtually every day not taken up by one of 266 events this year is needed for 
load-in/load-out time); more than 640,000 people attended performances in 1988, 
compared to 607,000 in 1987; paid attendance for events programmed by Kendrick 
and Morr (as opposed to booked into the center by others) was 85%, 20 points 
above the national average; and paid attendance for all performances since the 
center's opening has been 80%, also well above the national average. 
</P>
<P>
"At almost any price, they're a bargain," agreed Roger Johnson, head of Western 
Digital Co. of Irvine and the Center's vice chairman for the corporate 
campaign. "They came to a brand-new area with a brand-new facility. I don't 
think anything speaks better than the end result," in terms of paid attendance 
and the quality of the presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Center chairman Henry Segerstrom, whose fortune was based in part on 
agriculture, said that comparing Kendrick and Morr's compensation to those of 
other arts center heads is like comparing "apples to apricots." For one thing, 
lower salaries in Cleveland may go a lot further than higher ones in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Differences are especially pronounced, Segerstrom said, between a facility such 
as the Orange County center, which depends entirely on private funding, and 
those that receive a large segment of financial support from government. 
</P>
<P>
In order to judge the cost effectiveness of Kendrick and Morr's compensation, 
"you have to look at the total executive payroll," Johnson agreed. "We are not 
terribly heavy on staff at the center." 
</P>
<P>
However, in addition to Kendrick and Morr, the Orange County center reported 
that 27 other employees earned more than $30,000 in 1988. The Los Angeles Music 
Center listed only 11 in that pay range. The corresponding figures at other 
centers ranged from 2 at the Wortham Center in Houston to 106 at Lincoln 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to find an exact comparison for the $73-million Orange County 
center, which has one stage -- Segerstrom Hall -- and 65 full-time employees. 
The current annual budget is $15.4 million. Apart from its tax-exempt status, 
the center has no governmental support. There were 266 paid, ticketed 
performances in 1988 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
A county facility with three halls, the Los Angeles Music Center has 400 
employees and operates on $75 million a year. There were 976 paid, ticketed 
performances at the Music Center during the 1987-88 season. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick and Morr also are, by far, the highest-paid arts administrators in 
Orange County, according to information provided to the IRS. David Emmes and 
Martin Benson, the founders and artistic directors of the South Coast Repertory 
Theatre, earn $65,000 each; Louis Spisto, executive director of the Pacific 
Symphony, earns $67,000, and Kevin Consey of Newport Harbor Art Museum earns 
$85,000.

<P>
Felix S. Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspected of spying for the Soviet Union, 
appears to have been tipped off by Soviet handlers that he was under suspicion 
before the FBI first questioned him in June, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, by the time State Department investigators asked Bloch about his 
activities as a U.S. diplomat in Vienna and Washington, he may have had time to 
destroy evidence that could have strengthened a case against him, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent discovery that Soviet agents warned Bloch that he was under U.S. 
scrutiny appeared to throw another complicating factor into a 
counterintelligence investigation that was already laboring under an unusual 
set of handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Information Lacking 
</P>
<P>
The FBI has been shadowing Bloch, the former deputy chief of the U.S. Embassy 
in Vienna, since at least June 22, but it still does not have sufficient 
information either to arrest him or to provide an estimate of what kind of 
intelligence he may have turned over to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The few officials who have been briefed about the investigation acknowledge 
that the evidence against Bloch remains fragmentary and may never support a 
criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"This may become one of the great unsolved mysteries of our time," one official 
said. Unless Bloch agrees to talk to federal investigators -- or defects to the 
Soviet Union and writes his memoirs -- "we'll probably never know the full 
extent of his activities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to know what damage he's done until you get your hooks into him," a 
former intelligence official added. 
</P>
<P>
Far from cooperating with investigators, Bloch led a motorcade of FBI agents 
and television camera crews on a brief chase through New York's suburban 
Westchester County into Manhattan on Monday. He had been staying with a 
daughter in the town of Chappaqua. 
</P>
<P>
After Bloch entered an office building at 10 Columbus Circle, the agents and 
media kept a several-hour vigil outside, with television reporters filing live 
reports from the scene speculating on whom he might be seeing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief in Vienna 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, a 30-year veteran of the Foreign Service, was deputy chief of the U.S. 
Embassy in Vienna from 1983 until 1987. He is currently director of the State 
Department's office of regional political-economic affairs for Europe, a job 
that oversees regional economic issues -- including limits on high-technology 
exports to the Soviet bloc. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent Soviet early warning to Bloch was first reported by ABC News on 
Monday evening. A senior U.S. official said the report "appears to be true." 
</P>
<P>
One of Bloch's Soviet contacts telephoned him earlier this year, according to 
ABC, and tipped him off with a cryptic message: "A bad virus is going around, 
and we believe you are infected." 
</P>
<P>
The warning apparently occurred after U.S. counterintelligence agents 
videotaped Bloch handing a briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris earlier this 
year. The discovery that Bloch was apparently involved in spying was 
"inadvertent," one official said Monday, adding: "It happened while we were 
seeing what a Soviet was up to." 
</P>
<P>
After that incident, the FBI placed Bloch under surveillance, but apparently 
did not catch him in another overtly suspicious act, officials said. U.S. 
officials still do not know what the briefcase contained. 
</P>
<P>
In June, officials said, State Department security officials confronted Bloch 
with what they knew and questioned him briefly, but the diplomat did not choose 
to cooperate with the investigation, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On 'Administrative Leave' 
</P>
<P>
On June 22, the State Department placed him on "administrative leave," meaning 
he cannot work but still draws a full salary and benefits. The department also 
canceled Bloch's building pass and began the process of revoking his top-secret 
security clearance. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after those actions, Bloch was allowed -- under guard -- to remove his 
personal belongings from the State Department building and to close out his 
credit union account. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush called the allegations about Bloch "most serious" and said he 
had known about them "for some time," but he declined to discuss the details of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters about the case as he began a meeting with a group of 
senators Monday morning, Bush said: "The minute I heard about it, I was 
aggrieved, because it is a very tragic thing should these allegations be true." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how the case might affect U.S.-Soviet relations, Bush said: "It doesn't 
help," but quickly added: "I think everybody around this table knows that there 
have been -- espionage goes on." 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III had personally informed Bush about the investigation but refused to say 
when. "Obviously, because it is an ongoing investigation, we're very reluctant 
to comment on any aspects of it," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the issues under investigation, officials said, is whether Bloch may have 
provided information to the Soviet Union about Western attempts to halt 
high-technology smuggling to the Soviet Bloc. The issue is critical to Moscow, 
which has often relied on illegally obtained military technology to improve its 
own weapons systems, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
For most of a decade, Bloch played a role in setting and negotiating U.S. 
policy on the high technology issue, beginning in 1980, when he became economic 
officer at the Vienna embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"Vienna is a center of that trade, and we were constantly working to try to cut 
off unauthorized exports of sensitive technology," said another official who 
served in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
According to one official, Bloch opposed a U.S. move to crack down on Austria 
in the early 1980s because of the country's relatively lax attitude toward 
high-technology exports. But other officials said they did not recall that 
Bloch had taken a visible position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
More recently in Washington, Bloch's job as director for regional 
political-economic affairs in Europe gave him "a seat at the table" when 
high-technology issues were being discussed, one official said. As recently as 
last month, officials said, Bloch participated in the negotiations that led to 
a decision to permit the sale of personal computers to the Soviet Union and 
Soviet Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
However, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler added, "I would not 
characterize him as a key player." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, another official said, the investigation is "a long way from any 
kind of damage assessment." 
</P>
<P>
And, it appears, it is still some distance from an arrest as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's awfully hard to make an espionage case out of a briefcase," one official 
noted, "when you don't know what's in it." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers John J. Goldman, in New York, and David Lauter and Jim 
Mann, both in Washington, contributed to this story.

PROPOSED ARMS PACT LAUNCHES STRATEGY DEBATE

<TEXT>
<P>
The prospective agreement in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks with the Soviet 
Union sounds like an arms controller's dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
As formulated in principle by former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the treaty promises to cut almost in half the 
long-range nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. It could 
save the United States an estimated $2 billion a year in the short term and 
even more in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the treaty, as it is expected to emerge in final form from the talks that 
were resumed last month in Geneva, already is the subject of intense criticism 
and debate. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome of that debate, any strategic arms cuts on the scale 
envisioned in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) will require the 
United States to make vast changes in its national security planning and its 
nuclear arsenal -- changes that represent a priceless opportunity to correct 
past mistakes or, critics warn, to make dangerous new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly," said Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services 
Committee, "our entire targeting doctrine needs to be rethought in light of the 
START reductions." 
</P>
<P>
Some arms control experts, including former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger, complain that the treaty, as conceived, would contain terms that 
could actually make a nuclear war more likely rather than less likely. 
Kissinger and others argue that, depending on how the weapons reductions are 
carried out, the Soviets could have an incentive to launch a first strike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wiping Out the Peace Dividend 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Pentagon is contending, much as it did when the first Strategic Arms 
Limitation Treaty was negotiated in 1972, that it will need a variety of 
sophisticated and more costly weapons as a result of a new treaty -- more than 
wiping out any so-called peace dividend. 
</P>
<P>
"START has clearly put us in a bind," admitted a senior national security 
official in the Bush Administration. He said it has exposed contradictions in 
U.S. policies toward controlling the arms race, acquiring new nuclear weapons, 
choosing Soviet targets for U.S. nuclear weapons and deterring nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
These issues converge at a time when Cold War pressures appear to be subsiding, 
partly because of budget constraints at home and partly because of Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's warming smiles abroad. 
</P>
<P>
But experts across the political spectrum agree that ironing out the 
contradictions and unresolved disputes embedded in U.S. strategy becomes more 
rather than less urgent as the Cold War wanes. 
</P>
<P>
That military buildups undertaken without coherent plans have often proved 
wasteful is a historical truism. Defense specialists warn, however, that a 
weapons "build-down" such as that now envisaged in START could be disastrous 
without a coherent strategy for obtaining weapons suited to the post-START 
world and without developing effective plans for using them against Soviet 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
The START talks, which began under President Reagan, were delayed until June by 
Bush Administration officials so they could examine how the talks had 
progressed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had some reservations about whether, if we conclude the present 
agreement strictly in accordance with its present direction, we could get it 
ratified (by the Senate)," Secretary of State James A. Baker III said. 
</P>
<P>
When the START talks resumed, the United States sought to speed up work on 
verification measures, even though it did not know what the agreement's precise 
terms would be. And Bush emphasized that beyond weapons reduction, the goal of 
any agreement would be to "enhance security and strategic stability." 
</P>
<P>
He then reaffirmed the key principles negotiated so far, seeming to brush aside 
the concerns expressed by some members of his national security team. 
</P>
<P>
As approved last year by Reagan and Gorbachev, the treaty would limit the 
United States and the Soviet Union to 1,600 delivery systems each -- that is, 
intercontinental missiles and bombers. The United States now has about 2,000 
missiles and bombers; the Soviet Union has about 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Accountable' Nuclear Weapons 
</P>
<P>
These delivery systems could carry no more than 6,000 "accountable" nuclear 
weapons -- that is, weapons such as warheads that count against that ceiling 
and sub-ceilings under it. The result is that considerably more than 6,000 
weapons will be permitted, in fact, on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Of these 6,000 weapons, no more than 4,900 could be ballistic missile warheads. 
These warheads, because they are fast-flying and accurate, are most capable of 
delivering a surprise attack aimed at knocking out the other side's hardened, 
or fortified, missile silos. 
</P>
<P>
Bombers, because they are slow and can be recalled after takeoff, will be 
discounted: If they carry only bombs and short-range attack missiles, rather 
than ground-hugging cruise missiles, they will count as only one weapon. 
Because the United States has about 200 B-52 and B-1 bombers, each of which can 
carry between 12 and 16 bombs and short-range nuclear missiles, between 2,400 
and 3,200 of these nuclear weapons would not be subject to the treaty's limits. 
The situation with the Soviets is similar. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has about 13,000 long-range nuclear weapons and the Soviets 
have about 12,000. START would reduce these totals by 25% to 30% overall, to 
between 8,000 and 9,000 on each side, although it would reduce the number of 
the most dangerous weapons -- the ballistic missile warheads -- by 40% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the START treaty's obvious appeal, some experts are critical of some of 
its provisions because they could have the effect of leaving the Soviets with 
relatively more nuclear warheads aimed at U.S. missile silos than they have 
now. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Silos Targeted 
</P>
<P>
At present, the Soviets have about three warheads targeted on every U.S. silo. 
Under START, this ratio could go as high as 9 to 1, according to arms 
specialists Edward L. Warner III and David A. Ochmanek, authors of the new book 
"Next Moves." This would be the outcome if the United States reduced its forces 
under START by eliminating mostly land-based missiles -- a pattern it might 
follow to avoid cutting back its relatively impregnable submarine-based 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger argues that in a crisis, having so many missiles available to use 
against U.S. silos could tempt the Soviets to launch a surprise attack in the 
hope of wiping out this country's land-based missile force. 
</P>
<P>
Warner and Ochmanek, among others, are less concerned about this possibility. 
U.S. missile silos are already vulnerable to Soviet attack, they reason, and 
even if the Soviets had more warheads to aim at U.S. missile silos, they would 
not waste more than three on each target. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Soviets would realize that even if they could wipe out all U.S. 
intercontinental missiles, they would still have to contend with missiles 
carried by submarines and bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Congress would probably reject a treaty that appeared to increase U.S. 
vulnerability, unless it was assured that START reductions will be structured, 
and new weapons will be purchased, to avoid this liability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviet Targets 
</P>
<P>
Of even greater concern to some experts is the impact of the treaty on the 
other side of the equation: the U.S. targeting of strategic locations in the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the U.S. nuclear force is aimed at Soviet nuclear weapons sites. START 
would eliminate more of these warheads -- eight or 10 times more, by some 
calculations -- than the Soviet missiles at which they are targeted. 
</P>
<P>
This would leave a major shortfall of U.S. weapons to cover all the targets 
they now threaten. Thus one apparently inevitable consequence of the START 
treaty would be that some Soviet sites now targeted by U.S. missiles would have 
to be dropped. Or at the very least, the number of U.S. weapons now allocated 
to particular targets would be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
For example, where current U.S. targeting plans might call for firing three 
warheads at each hardened Soviet missile silo to ensure its destruction, only 
two warheads might be allocated to each target after START takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
But such reevaluations might turn out to be a plus, many specialists believe, 
by forcing the Air Force to end many wasteful targeting practices that it now 
follows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Empty Tank Farms, Barracks 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon might decide, for instance, that it is no longer necessary to 
cover all Soviet missile silos for purposes of a retaliatory U.S. strike, 
because -- if the United States were responding to a Soviet attack -- most 
Soviet missiles would already have been launched. Similarly, if the Soviets 
were to launch a surprise attack, the tank farms and troop barracks now on U.S. 
targeting lists would be largely vacated in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a plausible first response (to START) not to aim any longer at empty 
places," said a highly experienced retired military officer who continues to 
consult on such issues. "That way we need not suffer a reduction in coverage 
and of damage expectancy." 
</P>
<P>
Some experts have long argued that the Pentagon should have made this decision 
decades ago, thereby reducing its demand for nuclear weapons and avoiding the 
present vastly overbuilt stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
A separate controversy revolves around the number of missiles each side should 
be allowed to have. The treaty as now being negotiated would limit each side to 
1,600 missiles and bombers, but Warner and Ochmanek argue that the United 
States would be better off with a somewhat higher limit -- perhaps 1,800 or 
2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, appeared to favor 
a higher ceiling before he joined the White House team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Difficult for Surprise 
</P>
<P>
The rationale for this view is that having more missiles for the Soviets to aim 
at would reduce the ratio of Soviet weapons to U.S. targets, making it more 
difficult for Moscow to succeed in any surprise attack. That in turn would 
reduce the Soviets' temptation to start a war. 
</P>
<P>
To these experts, it is far more important that the treaty limit warheads 
rather than the vehicles that carry them. Some go so far as to suggest that 
there should be no limit on missiles at all, that limits should apply only to 
warheads. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has decided not to seek a higher ceiling, in part 
because it could be politically dangerous to appear to be moving in the wrong 
direction by seeking to keep more missiles rather than fewer. 
</P>
<P>
To the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Strategic Air Command, the United States 
must compensate for the reduced arsenal it would have under a START treaty by 
modernizing its remaining strategic forces. In their view, all necessary Soviet 
targets could be covered adequately in the post-START world and the Soviets 
deterred from launching an attack if more accurate, powerful and flexible 
weapons are acquired. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, in an era of budget deficits, is that the shopping list is long 
and very expensive. Here is what the Pentagon says it would need if the treaty 
becomes effective: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A new ICBM program, already the subject of considerable controversy. The 
Pentagon originally wanted 50 new MX missiles on rails, each armed with 10 
nuclear warheads. Cost: $15 billion. Congressional Democrats as well as many 
experts, including Scowcroft, then a private citizen, favored building 500 
single-warhead Midgetman missiles, to be mounted on special trucks. Cost: $27 
billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
A compromise has been worked out in which the existing 50 MXs now in silos will 
be put on rails in the early 1990s, at a cost of about $5.4 billion. Meanwhile, 
work is being accelerated on Midgetman, aiming for deployment in the late 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The B-2 stealth bomber. This is a particularly high Air Force priority. It 
would cost about $70 billion for 132 planes. The Pentagon delayed the program 
for a year because of budgetary and technical problems. Initial operation of 
the plane is now scheduled for 1992. But despite a dramatic test flight last 
week, funding for the B-2 still remains a subject of dispute in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Other modernization programs. These include more Trident missile 
submarines, at $2 billion each, an air-launched cruise missile using stealth 
technology, at $7 billion, and more secure command and control systems, at an 
undetermined cost. 
</P>
<P>
"If the modernization program should be stopped," the SAC commander, Gen. John 
T. Chain, warned in an interview at his headquarters at Omaha, Neb., "then I 
will go (to Congress) to testify against the START treaty, and so will the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff." 
</P>
<P>
The fight over which missile to buy -- the MX or the Midgetman -- for the 
post-START arsenal dramatizes a basic disagreement within the national security 
community over what types of nuclear weapons and what capabilities will be most 
important. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute ostensibly revolves around money. Midgetman is roughly twice as 
expensive for each warhead delivered. But the root disagreement is over which 
weapon would best deter a Soviet attack in a post-START world of drastically 
reduced arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
One school, made up primarily of civilian arms experts and congressional 
Democrats, insists that the new missiles should be configured to survive any 
Soviet attack and still retaliate. A recent Brookings Institution study 
concluded that the survivability of weapons would grow in importance as the 
arsenals are reduced. 
</P>
<P>
The other school, centered in the military and among conservative politicians, 
prefers weapons that can better fight wars and destroy the enemy's weapons, 
even if they are less safe from a first strike. Gen. Larry D. Welch, the Air 
Force chief of staff, has said that "survivability has been overplayed. . . . 
The real issue is capability." 
</P>
<P>
This dispute reflects the tension between advocates of two strategies for 
fighting a nuclear war: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The retaliatory strategy of assuring the Soviets that the United States can 
ride out any Soviet attack and, in retaliation, destroy much of Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The war-fighting strategy of being able to knock out Soviet weapons before 
they can be used on the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of both strategies have long recognized the need for making 
intercontinental ballistic missiles mobile as the growing number and accuracy 
of Soviet missiles through the 1970s made U.S. silo-based ICBMs increasingly 
vulnerable to a surprise attack. A Soviet attack in which two or three SS-18 
warheads were targeted on each U.S. missile silo would destroy between 66% and 
95% of the U.S. ICBM force, according to Pentagon estimates. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. submarine-launched missiles and many bombers would be expected to escape 
and be able to retaliate. But the consensus of military and civilian experts is 
that the land-based missile leg of the U.S. triad of nuclear forces should not 
be permitted to become significantly weaker than the others. 
</P>
<P>
The most credible solution to this problem, mobility, has already been embraced 
by the Soviets. They have deployed 10-warhead SS-24 ICBMs on rails and 
single-warhead SS-25s on trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, the U.S. proposal for a START treaty would ban mobile ICBMs, 
even though the Bush Administration wants to build both rail-mobile and 
road-mobile ICBMs. The Administration has promised to withdraw this prohibition 
element from the START negotiations once it gets assurance from Congress that 
lawmakers will fund its two-missile program. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the United States probably will not be able to afford both missiles 
indefinitely and will have to choose. The choice may come at the bargaining 
table in Geneva, where the superpowers probably will examine whether to ban 
multi-warhead mobile missiles, including the MX and the SS-24, as part of the 
START treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Or it may be made unilaterally in Washington, if the Administration can resolve 
its internal ambivalence on which type of mobile missile to support. The White 
House emphasizes the survivability of new weapons, and this indicates that it 
favors the Midgetman; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney initially backed the MX. 
</P>
<P>
The military's insistence on weapons that are better at war-fighting than 
surviving is partly instinctive -- "shooting first at whatever is shooting at 
you," as one general said -- and partly fear that political leaders will 
equivocate rather than act decisively in times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Pentagon put 50 MX missiles, each with 10 warheads, into fixed 
silos last year, although they are just as vulnerable as the three-warhead 
Minuteman missiles that they replaced. Also, they are more attractive as 
targets because they carry more warheads and are more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
One four-star general reportedly declared that he wanted the MX even if it had 
to be "put in the Pentagon parking lot," i.e., above ground, where it would be 
extremely vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more to the Pentagon's preference for power over survivability in 
nuclear weapons. The less survivable the weapons, the faster the United States 
must respond in a crisis. And a strategy of faster U.S. reaction means more 
certain and more punishing retaliation against the Soviets, while a policy of 
riding out a surprise attack before retaliating opens the way to all kinds of 
problems and potential failure. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. weapons might never be launched, military leaders believe, because 
many command and control systems might not survive an initial attack. And 
decision-making by political leaders could be paralyzed. Still other problems 
could develop. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, military leaders tend to favor acting before a full first strike 
has been absorbed and, in the meanwhile, to develop weapons capable of 
delivering the most devastating blows possible. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, of course, note that such a strategy calls for weapons capable of 
hair-trigger reaction, which could bring war closer and increase the risks of 
catastrophic mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
With so many complex issues to be resolved, experts say, the START treaty will 
leave in its wake years of debate and decision-making, far more than the arms 
limitation agreements of two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
And while the risks are certain to be emphasized, the opportunities should be 
at least as great. 
</P>
<P>
START would make it possible for the Bush Administration to resolve wasteful 
and contradictory tension within existing policies: to create a smaller but 
equally deterring nuclear force structure, to plan more efficient use of the 
smaller number of nuclear weapons and to coordinate U.S. arms control policy 
with U.S. weapons acquisition policy. 
</P>
<P>
No Administration since the dawn of the nuclear era has had a better chance to 
reform U.S. deterrent doctrine. Whether President Bush is able to do so may 
become a major factor in determining his place in history.

RECORD ALTERED ON CITY DEPOSIT; 
</P>
<P>
REFERENCE TO MAYOR IN FAR EAST BANK REPORT DELETED, AUDITOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Officials in the Los Angeles city treasurer's office removed from a document a 
phrase indicating that Mayor Tom Bradley instructed them to deposit $2 million 
of taxpayer money in a bank that employed him, a city auditor disclosed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The alteration was made after Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg informed aides that 
Bradley's ties to the Far East National Bank were being examined by news 
reporters, who "would be looking very closely at the documents involved," 
auditor Ed Corser testified before a City Council committee. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation constitutes one of the most damaging pieces of evidence yet to 
surface in a burgeoning investigation of the fifth-term mayor's personal 
financial dealings with businesses and stockbrokers. Bradley has maintained 
that, although he discussed the city's ties to Far East with the treasurer, he 
never directed that public funds be deposited in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Corser said Los Angeles police have determined that a reference to Bradley was 
obscured with white correction ink -- commonly called white-out -- on a 
treasurer's office document that reported the $2-million deposit in Far East, 
which last year paid the mayor $18,000 in consultant fees. He has since 
returned the money. 
</P>
<P>
The white-out concealed the notation "per the mayor," Corser said, adding that 
a black felt marker was then used on the document's reverse side to further 
obliterate the mayoral reference. In its place was added the handwritten 
phrase, "per Leonard Rittenberg." 
</P>
<P>
The "per the mayor" notation appeared underneath an entry reporting the Far 
East deposit. 
</P>
<P>
The alteration occurred on the same document that auditors last week said had 
been doctored to show that Far East was awarded the deposits through a mandated 
competitive bidding procedure, even though it had not been. 
</P>
<P>
The deposit was made on the same day that Bradley discussed Far East with 
Rittenberg. The mayor, while refusing to divulge specifics, has indicated that 
he merely asked the treasurer generally about the city's policy regarding 
investments in minority-owned banks. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has said that it was during this conversation that he first learned 
that the city was doing business with the minority-owned Far East bank -- a 
contention that apparently has been contradicted by public records. Rittenberg 
has maintained that he acted on his own in deciding to deposit money with Far 
East after the telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, amid growing suspicion at City Hall about Bradley's role in the Far 
East deposit, the mayor refused to comment on the newest revelations. 
</P>
<P>
But his deputy mayor, Michael Gage, continued to insist that Bradley exerted no 
pressure on Far East's behalf and that he returned the bank's consulting fees 
two days after learning of the city's ties to Far East in his March 22 
conversation with the treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think folks are off on a tangent and will get greater clarity tomorrow and 
the next day," Gage said, adding: "And those who are most skeptical today will 
be the most red-faced in the near future when the city attorney has concluded 
his investigation" into the mayor's outside business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn has been assigned to investigate the mayor's dealings 
with the bank and other allegations. Meanwhile, federal investigators have 
opened a preliminary inquiry into Bradley's stock dealings. 
</P>
<P>
The latest disclosures came during testimony by auditor Corser in the City 
Council's cavernous chambers, where the atmosphere was anxious. Two flanks of 
television cameras were set up to record the businesslike delivery by the 
auditor and the incredulous questioning by Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who 
heads the three-member committee that summoned the treasurer, auditor and 
others to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Corser's testimony consumed more than an hour on a day that had been set aside 
for Rittenberg to answer the stunning allegations in the city administrative 
office's report, which Corser had supervised. 
</P>
<P>
But the auditor's new disclosures overshadowed Rittenberg's often confusing 
defense of his actions and gave the drawn and tired treasurer even more to 
explain. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Corser painted a picture of an office that seemed panicked by 
the prospect of exposure and set about during a single day in late March to 
hurriedly cover tracks. It was a day that saw a call from the mayor, questions 
from a Los Angeles Herald Examiner reporter and a hasty meeting that led to the 
creation of a document which has jolted the Bradley Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Corser said his testimony Monday was based primarily on the firsthand accounts 
of city investment officer George Sehlmeyer, who had written the expunged 
reference to Bradley on the document. Here, according to Corser, is what 
Sehlmeyer recounted: 
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of March 22, Rittenberg summoned to his office Sehlmeyer and 
cash management officer William Hoss. The treasurer indicated that reporters 
had been questioning him about Bradley and Far East and that the newspapers 
obviously "would be looking very closely at the documents involved." 
</P>
<P>
The three men discussed the fact that Far East was awarded $2 million in 
deposits that very morning without the required competitive bidding process, 
which is designed to ensure that taxpayers get the highest rate of return on 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Bids 
</P>
<P>
Even though the deposit already had been given to Far East, Hoss offered to get 
additional bids to place on the document, called a bid sheet. One of the bank 
officers he listed was on medical leave, a discrepancy that would later tip 
investigators to problems with the document. 
</P>
<P>
Corser testified that Rittenberg momentarily rejected Hoss' idea, but quickly 
relented, authorizing other banks to be placed on the bid sheet. 
</P>
<P>
In altering the document, Hoss noted the phrase "per the mayor" next to the Far 
East deposit "and said, in effect, we can't have that there." He proceeded to 
"white it out," Corser said, relating the information from the investment 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
As Corser laid out this version, the hearing room fell completely quiet. 
Rittenberg sat impassively, betraying little emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Hoss, in interviews with the city administrative office and in letters to the 
city attorney, has denied altering any documents or engaging in any 
improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
Sehlmeyer, reached for comment by The Times, said, "I have not done anything 
illegal or unethical." He said that whatever investigators want to know, "I'll 
tell them to the best of my ability." 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg, for his part, also denied that he acted improperly. During his 
testimony Monday before the City Council, he attempted to portray himself as a 
victim of staff members who failed to follow his clearly stated policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowhere did I instruct or tell my staff to make those placements 'per the 
mayor,' " Rittenberg said. "What I did say to my staff when I walked in in the 
morning was, 'I just received a telephone call from the mayor regarding Far 
East National Bank -- what is the status?' " 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg, recalling the events of March 22, the day of the alleged cover-up, 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"I had a brief conversation with the mayor where the mayor related to me that 
he spoke with the chairman of Far East National Bank, and then made an inquiry 
to me as to whether we had time deposits with Far East. I told him we did and 
that I intended to retain such a relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg said that only several days before, he had told his staff to renew 
all maturing certificates of deposit in minority-owned banks -- Far East, by 
inference, being one of them. He said this policy was designed to help 
encourage minority entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
He said that after his conversation with the mayor, he asked his staff the 
status of Far East's accounts with the city. He said he was "flabbergasted" to 
learn that a $1-million deposit had matured and was withdrawn -- in violation 
of his directive. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg instructed his staff to renew that deposit and throw in another $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
It is at this point where the treasurer's account becomes confusing. Rittenberg 
said he instructed his staff to get competitive bids even though the deposits 
already had been given to Far East at his direction. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to reconcile this apparent contradiction, Rittenberg said he wanted to 
determine whether the Far East bid was "in the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg said that when his subordinate, Hoss, returned with the bid sheet 
listing the names of the other banks, "I noticed the white-out . . . it was 
easy to discern what it said. All you had to do was turn the sheet over and you 
could see it said 'per the mayor.' That upset me a great deal. I said why is it 
whited out, I got no explanation. I was disturbed. . . . Mr. Sehlmeyer, after I 
asked him why he wrote 'per the mayor,' could give me no explanation." 
</P>
<P>
Around noon that same day, Rittenberg said City Hall reporter John Schwada of 
the Herald Examiner questioned him for more than two hours on the phone and in 
person, asking whether the treasurer was aware that a "high-placed official" 
was connected to Far East. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I wasn't," recalled Rittenberg, who then said he called Gage and 
another mayoral aide, both of whom were out of the office. "I was disturbed 
that some person that I was doing business with had a purported tie with a 
high-placed official." 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg said he later learned through the reporter that Bradley was the 
highly placed official. Although he said Gage and the other mayoral aide 
returned his call, he did not disclose during his testimony the content of 
their conversations, nor was he asked to. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg referred to the entire day of March 22 as a "fiasco." 
</P>
<P>
His account differs significantly from information provided to city auditors by 
his subordinate, Sehlmeyer, in at least one key respect. Sehlmeyer said the bid 
sheet was altered after the newspaper inquiries. Rittenberg said it occurred 
before. 
</P>
<P>
The committee members did not ask the treasurer about an allegation leveled 
Friday in the auditor's report that he had told the council that the Far East 
deposit was awarded through competitive bidding. He was not asked Monday to 
explain this. 
</P>
<P>
The recent disclosures all stem from a city auditor's report on the matter. 
Various other investigations, including the lead probe by the city attorney, 
have yet to deliver any reports on their findings. The district attorney's 
office, which would investigate any felony, reiterated Monday that it was not 
involved in any Bradley investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Dist. Atty Greg Thompson, after speaking with Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner, said that the district attorney's office would stick to an agreement 
made at the start of the investigation that the city attorney's office, with 
the assistance of the Los Angeles Police Department, would be responsible for 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the increasingly serious nature of the charges should lead the 
district attorney to step in, Thompson replied: "Somebody is already 
investigating. Too many cooks and so forth. . . . Right now we have the SEC, 
the FBI, the LAPD and the C.A. (city attorney), so we don't need the D.A.," 
said Thompson.

MEXICO DEBT ACCORD WON'T GUARANTEE FULL RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The landmark debt reduction agreement between Mexico and its foreign creditors 
has given President Carlos Salinas de Gortari a smashing political victory, but 
it remains to be seen whether he can convert this immediate success into 
long-term economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen and the stock market reacted enthusiastically to the long-awaited 
agreement, which will provide the Mexican government with an estimated $3 
billion in new loans annually while at the same time cutting its debt by $10 
billion to $12 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The news was like a soothing, cool shower after walking seven months and 24 
days in the desert," Excelsior newspaper editor Regino Diaz Redondo wrote 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Salinas administration, which took office Dec. 1, had been negotiating with 
the banks since April. The agreement reached Sunday offers commercial bankers 
three options to reduce the $54 billion that Mexico owes them: They may trade 
their outstanding loans for new 30-year Mexican government bonds at a 35% 
discount; trade existing loans for new bonds at the same value, but with the 
lower interest rate of 6.25%, or provide new money amounting to 25% of their 
outstanding loans to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told reporters that he 
received a phone call from Salinas on Monday expressing how "very pleased" he 
was with the agreement. The landmark accord also was the first success for 
Brady, who announced his debt reduction strategy last March. 
</P>
<P>
But some economists noted that the Mexican government had sought a $7-billion 
annual reduction in its net transfer of capital for a "permanent solution" to 
Mexico's debt problem. They said the deal, which only affects half of Mexico's 
$107-billion foreign debt, might not provide enough relief to turn around the 
country's prolonged economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"This will pull the economy out of its stagnation and uncertainty," said 
economist Carlos Ramirez, a columnist for El Financiero newspaper. "But it is 
not enough to bring about high, sustained growth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6% Annual Growth Sought 
</P>
<P>
Salinas has said his goal is 6% annual growth by the end of his term in 1994. 
He is seeking to reduce debt payments from 6% of gross national product to 2%. 
</P>
<P>
The government needs 6% annual growth just to absorb the approximately 1 
million new workers who enter the labor force each year, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, according to economists, it is up to Salinas to build on the psychological 
effects of the debt package. They said he must step up economic and political 
reforms and expand the country's deteriorated infrastructure -- the oil, 
electricity, telephone and transportation industries -- and must make the huge 
state-run companies that operate these industries more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
And he must do this without overheating the economy and spurring new inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said Salinas must resist political pressures to use the new cash 
flow to return to high government spending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Catch-22 Situation' 
</P>
<P>
"You have a Catch-22 situation," one European economic observer said. "Everyone 
is saying, 'Great job,' and they're ready to grow. But everyone to whom Salinas 
owes something will say, 'We want our wage increase' or 'We want our price 
hikes.' He has to tell them this is just the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
In his nationally televised announcement of the agreement Sunday night, Salinas 
attempted to do just that, saying that Mexicans "cannot expect to see 
spectacular results overnight." He vowed to stick to a wage and price control 
agreement with business and labor that is valid through March. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez said the economy already shows signs of overheating, with the economy 
growing by 1.8% the first quarter of the year, and manufacturing production up 
4.2%. Salinas, he said, must design a new anti-inflationary policy that is not 
based on wage and price controls. 
</P>
<P>
The social compact "provided the government with a margin for maneuvering to 
control inflation during the debt negotiations. But the negotiations took too 
long and the economy is very compressed. . . . The social, political and 
productive cost of the pact was very high -- no growth," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Salinas Urged to Slow Growth 
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that it is in the president's political interest, as well as 
his economic interest, to slow growth. 
</P>
<P>
"His political calendar will have him hold down economic growth until 1991, 
when there are congressional elections," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, economists predicted that the multi-year debt agreement 
would help attract capital back into the country and encourage foreign 
investment. The stock market offered its vote of confidence with 3.7% rise over 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's strategy throughout the negotiation was to distinguish itself from the 
rest of Latin America's debtors by stressing the radical reforms it has made in 
the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas said Mexico's debt agreement breaks new ground for other countries to 
build on.

BUSH URGES FULL FUNDING OF STEALTH BOMBER AS SKEPTICS CLAMOR FOR CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush made a last-minute pitch on Monday for full funding of the 
stealth bomber but skeptics in Congress appeared ready to place severe 
restraints on future production of the high-technology, boomerang-shaped 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
As both the House and Senate began debate on a $305-billion bill funding the 
nation's defense budget during fiscal 1990, the President summoned members of 
the Senate Armed Services Committee to the White House to lobby them to support 
his proposed military budget. 
</P>
<P>
Bush described the bomber -- also known as the B-2 -- as "a revolutionary plane 
with revolutionary technology" that is necessary for the nation's security, 
despite the estimated $70 billion that the government would spend overall to 
purchase a total of 132 bombers under the Administration's plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Justifies Spending 
</P>
<P>
When asked by reporters how he could justify spending so much for the bomber at 
a time when other programs are being cut, the President replied: "I justify it 
because I think the prime responsibility of a President is the national 
security of the United States, and I'm determined to put forth a program that 
is sound in every way . . . . And I also justify it because when you look at 
the full defense program, I want to have maximum flexibility as we have in arms 
control negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, in a letter to Congress, Bush argued against the view expressed by 
some members that the United States can begin to scale back on its financial 
commitment to strategic weapons in response to the peace gestures of Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to lower our defenses because of Gorbachev's rhetoric," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush's proposal to spend $3.9 billion on the stealth bomber in fiscal 
1990 appeared likely to clear the Senate with only minor adjustments, the 
request has spawned tremendous opposition in the House. Opponents include 
liberals as well as more conservative members whose home districts would lose 
Pentagon business as a result of the Administration's proposal to eliminate 
several other weapons systems, such as the F-14D fighter plane and the V-22 
Osprey helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Both opponents and supporters of the B-2 agree that the cost of the new bomber 
is -- as Rep. William L. Dickenson (R-Ala.) put it -- "astounding, it's 
mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
House members will get an opportunity to vote on two amendments opposed by the 
Administration -- one authored by Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) that 
would end the stealth program in fiscal 1990 and another offered by House Armed 
Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) that would suspend funding until 
the stealth program is scaled down to make it more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited to 13 Bombers 
</P>
<P>
The Dellums amendment, co-sponsored by Republican Reps. John R. Kasich of Ohio 
and John G. Rowland of Connecticut, would halt production of the B-2 after the 
Air Force takes possession of the 13 stealth bombers that Congress has already 
funded. The authors estimated it would generate a savings of about $8 billion a 
year in fiscal 1992 through fiscal 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, according to Dellums, the $23 billion that the government 
has already spent on stealth would not go to waste since it has produced 
technological expertise that can be applied to other programs, such as the 
stealth cruise missile. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's make the best of an already bad bargain by cutting our costs and 
redirecting current research and development efforts to more long-term 
cost-efficient weapons programs," Dellums told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin's amendment would trim $470 million from the stealth program and freeze 
all spending until the Pentagon redesigns the program to make it more 
economical. In addition, Aspin would limit the Air Force to buying only two 
bombers in fiscal 1990 -- instead of five bombers, as the Administration has 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
As in the Senate Armed Services Committee's version of the defense bill, 
spending for the B-2 under Aspin's amendment would also be frozen until the 
aircraft has successfully completed its first series of flight tests. 
</P>
<P>
The House is expected to vote on the stealth amendments on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Also in jeopardy in both the House and Senate is the Administration's request 
for $4.6 billion for the so-called "Star Wars" space-based anti-missile system. 
While the Senate Armed Services Committee approved $4.5 billion for "Star 
Wars," the House committee cut it to $3.8 billion, and the figure could be 
trimmed even further on the House and Senate floors. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the final spending level for "Star Wars" in fiscal 1990 is likely to 
be midway between the figures adopted in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) has called on the President to veto the defense 
spending bill if -- as expected -- the House adopts an amendment offered by 
Rep. Charles E. Bennett (D-Fla.) that would trim "Star Wars" back to $3.1 
billion. Such a cut would assure delays in the President's stated intention of 
deploying a strategic defense system by 1993, Wilson said.

With hundreds of angry shrimpers threatening to renew their blockade of Gulf of 
Mexico ports, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher agreed Monday to suspend a 
new requirement that shrimp boats be equipped with devices to keep sea turtles 
from becoming ensnared in the nets. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached during an emergency meeting between Mosbacher and Gulf 
Coast congressmen, placed an immediate 45-day moratorium on enforcement of the 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Just last Thursday, Mosbacher had ordered that the controversial law be 
enforced after an earlier suspension. 
</P>
<P>
The shrimpers say that the turtle-excluding devices cause them to lose as much 
as 40% of their catch; conservationists say the rule is necessary to save an 
endangered species of sea turtle. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher announced the plan after meeting with about two dozen congressmen 
from Gulf states. He said the suspension would allow a "cooling-off period."

AIDE SAYS SHAMIR MET WITH LOCAL PALESTINIAN ACTIVISTS

<P>
In recent weeks, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has met with local Palestinian 
activists who in all probability sent reports back to the Palestine Liberation 
Organization about Israel's peace plan, Shamir's top aide said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The aide, Yosef Ben-Aharon, insisted that such contacts do not constitute talks 
with the PLO, with which Israel refuses to deal. The Palestinians are reporting 
to the PLO only to protect themselves and not at the behest or knowledge of 
Shamir, Ben-Aharon explained. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an insurance policy for the Arabs," Ben-Aharon said. "You would expect 
them to clear their meetings or report to the PLO just to defend themselves 
from accusations they are dealing independently." 
</P>
<P>
The comments were the first by Shamir's office to suggest that it was expected 
that conversations he has with Arabs from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
have been passed on to the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
The remarks by Ben-Aharon, who is director of the prime minister's office, 
coincided with reports that Shamir recently met with PLO supporters from the 
occupied lands. Shamir has vowed never to deal with Arabs who represent the 
organization or who follow its dictates. His government not only considers the 
PLO wedded to terror but also opposes the group's demand for an independent 
state next to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
At his headquarters in Tunisia, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat asserted that he had 
authorized meetings between Palestinian representatives and Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
"Shamir is going around these days saying he is meeting Palestinian 
representatives in the territories. He says these are secret meetings, against 
the will of the PLO," Arafat told an Italian paper. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not true," he continued. "None of these meetings have taken place 
against our will. We have approved them from the beginning, and after the talks 
we have received full reports from our people." 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, newspapers published the names of four Palestinians who met with 
Shamir in recent days: Radwan abu Ayyash, head of the pro-PLO Arab Journalists 
Assn.; attorney Jamil Tarifi and pharmacist Ezzidin Aryan, all from the West 
Bank, and Mansour Shawwa, from the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Aryan heads the Red Crescent medical rescue society and belongs to the 
Palestine National Council, the PLO's self-styled parliament-in-exile. Shawwa 
is a member of a prominent family that has long had ties with Jordan's 
government. All denied meeting with Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, rules imposed by Israel's government ban contacts with the PLO, 
but it has never been clear whether that extends to open supporters. Defense 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and a representative of his in the occupied land, Shmuel 
Goren, have met with several pro-PLO activists in recent months, Israeli 
sources said, including the four mentioned in the Israeli press. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir has been looking for local Palestinians to sign onto his plan for 
elections in the West Bank and Gaza as a first step to peace. However, he has 
tiptoed carefully around the question of with whom he is willing to talk. Since 
offering his plan, Shamir has come under fire from hawkish members of his own 
Likud Party for risking the surrender of the occupied lands.

A court order requiring transit authorities nationwide to equip all new buses 
with wheelchair lifts was overturned by the full U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of 
Appeals on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The court said the U.S. District Court and a three-judge panel of the 3rd 
Circuit overstepped the boundaries of the lawsuit filed against the U.S. 
Transportation Department in 1988 by Americans Disabled for Accessible Public 
Transit and several other groups. 
</P>
<P>
A federal regulation already requires agencies to make new buses accessible to 
the handicapped, and the groups filing the lawsuit never argued that anyone was 
violating the provision, Circuit Judge Edward R. Becker wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has become a rallying point for activists for the handicapped, with 
groups calling on the Bush Administration to let the original 3rd Circuit 
ruling stand. The opinion Monday addressed the Administration's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The court upheld the federal provision targeted by the activists in their 
lawsuit, giving local agencies the right to decide how to serve the handicapped 
-- through accessible buses, para-transit services, or a combination. 
</P>
<P>
ADAPT had argued that the provision conflicted with the regulation on 
accessible buses, but the court disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
The rule strikes "a balance between preserving local discretion, avoiding the 
imposition of unduly burdensome costs and ensuring adequate transportation 
services" for the disabled, Becker wrote.

CRASH DEATHS CLIMB TO 111; TAIL DAMAGE STILL A PUZZLE

The tail section of the shattered United Airlines DC-10 was moved into a hangar 
Monday so that investigators could try to reassemble it, and officials said the 
initial phase of the crash probe was nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly by mid to late week we hope to have completed everything out at the 
airport," Ted Lopatkiewicz of the National Transportation Safety Board said. 
Meanwhile, searchers were still looking for pieces of the jet's rear engine, 
and the number of lives lost to the crash last Wednesday rose to 111 with the 
death of an injured passenger. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Bealer, 27, of Quakertown, Pa., died Sunday night at St. Luke's Regional 
Medical Center, Rhonda Ostrihonsky of the hospital staff said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
32 Still in Hospitals 
</P>
<P>
The plane carried 296 people, of whom 185 have survived. Officials at St. 
Luke's and Marian Health Center said that 32 of the survivors remained 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
United said that 108 bodies had been positively identified by Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Hopkins, speaking for United, said the airline on Monday provided a special 
flight to Chicago to carry 12 bodies, 29 relatives of the dead, one survivor 
and five United employees. On Sunday, a United flight carried 11 bodies, 33 
family members and one survivor to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
United officials said that Capt. Alfred C. Haynes, the pilot of Flight 232, 
would be released from Marian Health Center today and would make a statement. 
Haynes, of Seattle, has been praised for keeping the plane aloft and guiding it 
to the airport after almost all means of controlling the jet had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators used cranes to move the plane's tail section into a hangar, where 
they tried to piece it back together to determine how much damage was done when 
the No. 2 engine broke up over the farms of northwestern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Farm Fields Combed 
</P>
<P>
Other teams continued searching a 16-square-mile section of corn and soybean 
fields about 60 miles from the crash site, in hopes of finding missing pieces 
of the engine, Lopatkiewicz said. None had been found by Monday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had jets from the Nebraska Air National Guard take infrared 
photographs of the area and asked that farmers watch for pieces of the engine 
in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
Lopatkiewicz said it will "take about nine to 12 months" to determine what 
caused the jetliner's tail engine to come apart and sever hydraulic lines.

SECURITY ISSUES DELAY EX-CIA MAN'S TRIAL

<P>
The Justice Department, citing national security concerns, obtained a delay 
Monday in the Iran-Contra criminal case against the CIA's former station chief 
in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals judge in Richmond, Va., issued an emergency 
stay to temporarily block the trial of Joseph F. Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
The ex-CIA operative's trial was to have started Monday, but the CIA wanted to 
stop Fernandez's lawyers from identifying as part of his defense three CIA 
programs in Costa Rica and the sites of three CIA stations and facilities in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department sought the emergency stay after U.S. District Judge 
Claude Hilton rejected prosecutors' proposals to substitute numbers for the 
three CIA sites and to drop parts of one criminal charge against Fernandez to 
avoid mentioning the CIA programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton said Fernandez must be allowed to mention the names of the CIA programs 
and that substituting numbers for names of the three CIA sites was not 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Noble, a deputy assistant attorney general, told the judge that the 
department would seek a delay of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
With a pool of prospective jurors waiting in a room adjacent to the court, the 
judge, obviously irritated, asked Noble why the Justice Department had not 
taken such action a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very difficult thing for the department to do," Noble replied. He 
said that the proposals from the prosecutors "would allow this trial to go 
forward. We have no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
At the appeals court, the Justice Department is seeking to formally intervene 
in the case and wants the court to review Hilton's denial of the prosecutors' 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez is charged with lying about his involvement with Oliver L. North's 
Contra resupply network. He faces two counts of obstruction and two counts of 
making false statements. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department went to the appeals court instead of filing a national 
security affidavit with the court. Such a document would categorically bar 
disclosure of certain classified information and could kill the case.

KARCHERS SETTLE INSIDER-TRADING CASE WITH FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl N. Karcher, founder of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, and six of his 
relatives agreed Monday to settle civil charges of insider trading by paying a 
total of $664,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The case is settled. Carl just wanted to get it behind him for the benefit of 
his family and children," Thomas Holliday, Karcher's attorney, said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the consent agreement, Karcher and his family members neither admitted 
nor denied the charges made against them. Combined with a tentative pact with 
company accounting director Alvin DeShano, the settlement ends a civil lawsuit 
filed 15 months ago by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC had 
alleged that Karcher and others supplied private insider information to help 
his relatives avoid stock market losses of at least $310,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Settlement Failed 
</P>
<P>
An attempt last May to settle the SEC suit fell apart when federal prosecutors 
refused to rule out the possibility of criminal prosecution. Attorneys close to 
the case said the family received that guarantee in the settlement announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement requires Karcher, 72-year-old founder and chief executive of 
Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises, to pay a fine of $332,000, the amount 
that his relatives purportedly saved by selling company stock after he 
allegedly told them that the firm was about to report a dramatic drop in 
earnings. The accord also requires the six relatives to pay, overall, another 
$332,000 to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano, accounting director of Karcher Enterprises, also has tentatively 
agreed to pay $12,396, the amount he saved by selling his company stock, plus a 
penalty of $12,396. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Karcher family agreement, the DeShano settlement has not yet been 
approved by the SEC in Washington, but such approval is expected soon, sources 
close to the case said. Under the agreement, DeShano would not admit or deny 
wrongdoing but would agree not to violate securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 defendants sued last year for insider trading, only DeShano was 
criminally charged. After a five-day trial, a Los Angeles jury in June found 
that DeShano was not guilty of a single count of securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Although Karcher and his relatives settled the SEC action without admitting or 
denying the accusations, all agreed to court orders forbidding them to violate 
insider trading laws. 
</P>
<P>
General terms of the settlement with the Karcher family were approved several 
weeks ago by the SEC in Washington, SEC attorney John Koutsos said. Final 
details were negotiated Monday when case attorneys met for an hourlong, 
closed-door session with U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
By settling the case, Karcher chose to avoid both the emotional and financial 
costs of a trial, his lawyer said. "We had a winnable case," Holliday said, 
"but the monetary cost, in terms of lawyers and personal impact on the family, 
far outweighed the desire to win" at trial. 
</P>
<P>
Holliday estimated that legal costs could have approached $1 million for all 
seven Karcher family defendants. In addition to Carl Karcher they are: his 
daughter, Catherine Karcher Everly and her husband, Daniel Everly; daughter 
Margaret J. LaVecke; daughter Barbara Karcher Wall; son Jerome Karcher, and a 
son-in-law, Donald E. Fergus Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement gave the government "as much relief as we would have gotten had 
we won the entire case after a trial," Koutsos said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Koutsos, the settlement reached with the Karcher family is fairly 
standard in an insider-trading case. 
</P>
<P>
If Karcher had lost the civil suit, he personally could have been assessed a 
fine of three times the total amount of losses avoided, or $996,000. His six 
relatives could have been ordered to repay a total of $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano could have been assessed a total of $49,584 had he lost at a civil 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at Karcher Enterprises on Monday, DeShano expressed relief that the 
case is over but added that he is "disappointed" and "upset" by the amount of 
the fine. The SEC, he said, was "vindictive" in calculating the amount of his 
penalty. "But all things considered, it's only money . . . so it's not too 
bad," he added. 
</P>
<P>
At Carl Karcher Enterprises, chief financial officer Loren Pannier said he was 
"delighted that we have put this behind us." 
</P>
<P>
Charges against the other defendants named in the SEC complaint were resolved 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Judge Rafeedie decided that Karcher's son, Carl Leo Karcher, had 
illegally traded his stock and fined him $10,500. In April, the judge dropped 
Margaret Karcher, the founder's wife, from the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Six other family members, including Carl N. Karcher's brother and company 
president Donald Karcher, settled with the SEC in February by agreeing to pay 
$187,560. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

THE SCIENCE OF WRITING; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENTS PULL DOUBLE DUTY IN THE WILDS 
</P>

<P>
As the students hiked up into the Santa Monica Mountains toward Eagle Rock, 
they stopped to study the rocks, the clouds and a horned lizard, the size of a 
quarter, that could have starred in a movie called "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Stegosaurus." 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, a student dropped behind the rest of the group, pulled a 
journal from pocket or backpack and scribbled a paragraph or two. One student 
wrote a mini-essay about life and death, inspired by a patch of dead buckwheat. 
Another noted that the mountain trail was "as wide as a spare rib." 
</P>
<P>
The 16 students were taking an unusual interdisciplinary course being offered 
for the first time this summer by Santa Monica College. Called "Writing About 
Nature," the double-credit course is an introduction to physical geography and 
a beginning composition course. Co-taught by geographer Bill Selby and poet Jim 
Krusoe, it requires students to learn how to use both a sling psychrometer and 
a simile. Those who succeed get credit for both Geography 1 and English 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although the teachers' disciplines diverge dramatically, Selby and Krusoe say 
they have a common goal -- to teach students to observe closely and to record 
their observations with precision. "So many of our students have lost the 
ability to observe things that aren't fed to them," Selby said. "You have to be 
a good observer to be a great writer, and there's never been a great scientist 
who wasn't a great observer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six-Week Course 
</P>
<P>
During the six-week course, the students learn something about maps, weather 
and climate, geology and the plants and animals of Southern California. They 
work their way through a text called "Modern Physical Geography." Classroom 
lessons are supplemented with a weekly field trip, such as the recent hike to 
Eagle Rock in Topanga State Park. As the students are learning what an 
inversion layer is and why Los Angeles has this smog-trapping weather 
condition, they are also studying nature writing and learning how to string 
together their own words about the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe exposes the students to model nature writers as disparate as Romantic 
poet William Wordsworth and contemporary environmental activist Edward Abbey. 
According to Krusoe, Sue Hubbell's book "Country Year" is especially useful to 
beginning nature writers. Hubbell is "an immaculate writer," he said, and her 
book, best known for its section on bees, is "about someone staying at home, 
paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
In critiquing students' journal entries, Krusoe is quick to praise evidence 
that they are paying close attention, whether observing an alligator lizard 
barely visible in the dust or a distant cluster of homes that look like a 
beehive when viewed from the mountains. "The funny thing about paying 
attention," he told his students, as they perched on Eagle Rock, moments after 
displacing a raven, "is that when you really see something, sometimes it's even 
better than just using your imagination." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verbal Flourishes 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe said students tend to "get too pretty" when they first begin to write 
about storm clouds and life cycles. Krusoe's reading assignments for the course 
are examples of writing about nature without verbal genuflection. The writers 
have "natural voices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a geographer, Selby said he is repeatedly shocked and saddened at the lack 
of widespread knowledge about weather, the rock cycle and other natural 
phenomena. "It's scary to know that so many people know so little about the 
world we live in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Resting with the students on Eagle Rock, Selby talked about the materials -- 
mostly sandstone and conglomerates -- that formed the outcropping and the 
natural forces that created it and continue to shape it. Geology lessons are 
much more vivid in the wild than in the classroom, he noted. "You can't stand 
here and see the rock cycle, but you get a feeling for how the rock cycle is 
changing the landscape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Purposes 
</P>
<P>
Student Evelyn Batiste, 26, said she had taken the course to fulfill a science 
requirement and because she thought she would benefit from the writing 
component. After the first class, the Inglewood woman recalled, she was able to 
identify the stone in the campus parking lot as shale. As a result of the 
course, she said, she can think about things that she never even noticed 
before. 
</P>
<P>
After Selby's geology lesson on Eagle Rock, Krusoe asked the students to read 
their journal entries aloud. Frank Kianfar, a 23-year-old business major, 
began: "The live oak trees drop their leaves, and they are dead even before 
they hit the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe had good things to say about all of the students' brief essays. Like a 
conscientious parent, he tries to teach his charges without battering their 
self-esteem. "On a really good day," the poet said, "I feel my compliments are 
as creative as anything I've ever done."

Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne announced the move at a meeting with 
editors of Sri Lankan newspapers, a government official said.

VICTIM WAS STABBED TO DEATH, AUTOPSY SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An autopsy on the badly decomposed body of a man discovered in his bathtub last 
week revealed that he had been stabbed to death, police announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Alexander Porter, 23, may have been dead "anywhere from one to two 
weeks" when his body was found Wednesday in his apartment in the 1400 block of 
East Grove Avenue, Orange Police Sgt. Art Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
Employers at a local fast-food chain called police last week to say that 
Porter, an assistant manager, had not shown up for work for several days. 
Police entered the apartment with a passkey and found his body. 
</P>
<P>
Porter's death was not disclosed publicly until Monday, Romo said, because 
"when we first found the body, we didn't know what we had. We didn't know if it 
was a suicide or a natural death or what because of the badly decomposed state 
of the body." 
</P>
<P>
Missing and perhaps stolen in the attack were the victim's stereo equipment, 
television and his car -- a white, four-door 1981 Plymouth Fury, license number 
2KIW235, Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they have neither motive nor suspects and are seeking 
information.

HOSPITAL IDENTIFIES WOMAN HIT BY CARS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pedestrian struck by two cars in South Laguna was identified Monday by 
hospital officials as Herrisa Pennywell, 26, of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Pennywell remained in critical condition at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center in Mission Viejo following the accident Sunday on Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
She was struck as she tried to cross the highway about 1:30 a.m. near West 
Street, Laguna Beach police said. After being knocked into the hood and 
windshield of a car driven by a Long Beach man, Pennywell rolled back into the 
roadway, where she was struck by another motorist following behind in the 
northbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Both drivers immediately stopped and called help. Neither was cited, Laguna 
Beach Police Sgt. Ray Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
Pennywell's identity was initially a mystery because she carried no 
identification. Lardie said her boyfriend later provided identification.

Three people escaped unharmed Monday morning from a residential fire that 
caused an estimated $50,000 damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
More than two dozen firefighters battled the blaze in the 800 block of North 
Clementine Street, which was reported at 10:10 a.m., and held fire damage to 
the attic and a room addition. There was, however, water damage to much of the 
home, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor said she heard a "pop" and alerted a resident, Pauline Peterson, who 
ran to the rear of the home and woke up her goddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said that, in addition to Peterson and the child, another 
unidentified adult was assisted at the scene by Red Cross workers. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the blaze remained under investigation Monday.

YOUTH, 16, TO BE TRIED AS ADULT IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Huntington Beach youth who told police that he killed his 
roommate after being forced into a homosexual relationship was ordered Monday 
to stand trial as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Applegate, who admits that he fatally shot his roommate, Paul Londono, 
25, and then burned his body near the beach, could face a prison sentence of 27 
years to life if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
But Applegate's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Carol E. Lavacot, contends that 
Applegate himself is the victim in this case, adding that she hopes his trial 
will result, at most, in commitment to the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Lavacot contends that Applegate shot Londono only after Londono raped him and 
threatened to never let him go. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Brian got the gun, he sat down and thought, 'Is it going to have to be 
this way the rest of my life?' " Lavacot said. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Jill W. Roberts said Lavacot still refers to Applegate 
as a child. Roberts echoed Superior Court Judge Betty Lou Lamoreaux's statement 
Monday when she ordered Applegate tried as an adult: "He is not a child 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that a 16-year-old be tried as an adult if the crime is 
serious, shows sophistication and planning, and if the defendant has a history 
of other juvenile cases. 
</P>
<P>
"His crimes steadily became more sophisticated until it came to this," Roberts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But at Applegate's trial, Lavacot intends to lay the blame for what happened on 
Londono. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate met Londono in Florida when he was a bus boy at a gay bar where 
Londono was a bartender. Both the prosecution and the defense agree that the 
two struck up a friendship and decided to move to California together in June, 
1988. But it meant that Applegate would be violating his probation. He had been 
arrested and placed on probation for the burglary of two neighbors' houses and 
an auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
The two moved to Huntington Beach, appearing to the outside world as brothers: 
Londono was Christopher Stiles; Applegate was Sean Stiles. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Roberts claims that the trouble began when Applegate was arrested in 
Orange County on suspicion of burglary. Londono told his family that he could 
not put up with his young roommate's behavior and wanted him to move out. 
</P>
<P>
But Public Defender Lavacot claims that just the opposite was true: Applegate 
wanted out because Londono had coerced him into a homosexual relationship 
against Applegate's will. 
</P>
<P>
"He told Brian if he didn't cooperate, he would end up in prison back in 
Florida (as a probation violator), and that what happened to him there would be 
even worse," Lavacot said. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 8, 1989, Londono told one of his relatives that Applegate still had not 
moved out and that this was the night that they were going to have a serious 
talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
But Applegate claims that Londono was only covering up and trying to hide the 
homosexual acts from his family. Lavacot claims that Applegate was the one who 
wanted to move out. When he told Londono that night that he was leaving on Feb. 
1, Lavacot said, Londono raped him, then told him that forced sex would hurt 
even worse in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate reportedly waited between 30 minutes to an hour and a half before 
getting a gun and shooting Lavacot in the head while he slept. Lavacot said she 
believes that Applegate was still in a "heat of passion" state and should 
receive no more than a voluntary manslaughter conviction. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Roberts alleges that Applegate's actions after the shooting are 
inconsistent with Lavacot's version. Roberts alleges that Applegate burned the 
body on a bike path near the beach in Huntington Beach, stopping at a service 
station first to buy gasoline to set the body on fire. Then he told the slain 
man's family that Londono had received a call from someone with whom he ran 
off. 
</P>
<P>
The body went unidentified for two months. It was when a new roommate began to 
think that something was wrong that he entered Applegate's room and discovered 
blood on his mattress. Applegate had brought the mattress with him from the 
house he shared with Londono. It was the one Londono was sleeping on when shot. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also said Applegate had stolen Londono's car and sold it, and 
wrote $840 in forged checks from Londono's bank account. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears there was some kind of sexual relationship between the two," said 
prosecutor Roberts. "But this was a case of cold-blooded, premeditated murder." 
</P>
<P>
Applegate first denied the incident, then confessed after the body was 
identified as Londono's and autopsy reports showed that he had died of a 
gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
Even if tried as an adult and convicted, Applegate could get a break on 
sentencing if the court hears the complete story, Lavacot said. A judge would 
have the option to send Applegate to the Youth Authority, where he could remain 
until he is 25. 
</P>
<P>
"If he goes to prison, he's not going to get any help," Lavacot said. "I don't 
think that's where he belongs."

DANNEMEYER CAUSES FLAP IN CONGRESS BY DESCRIBING GAY SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A graphic description of homosexual sex acts placed in the Congressional Record 
by Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) has caused a flap in Congress, with 
an Indiana congressman branding the material obscene and threatening to seek an 
ethics investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about prurient interest," complained Rep. Andy Jacobs Jr., a Democrat 
representing the Indianapolis area. "I wouldn't want my kid reading that sort 
of thing." 
</P>
<P>
The material to which Jacobs referred was inserted in the June 29 Congressional 
Record, the official daily record of Capitol Hill debate. Dannemeyer's detailed 
descriptions of sex acts are part of a campaign to call attention to "what 
homosexuality really is," Paul Mero, Dannemeyer's press secretary, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after Dannemeyer provided the passage for the record, he released a 
letter calling on President Bush to investigate the impact that homosexual 
members of his Administration have had on tilting Administration policy toward 
the "homosexual movement" and away from the "heterosexual ethic." 
</P>
<P>
In a July 20 letter, Jacobs called on Dannemeyer to withdraw the descriptive 
paragraphs on the grounds that they appeared to violate the House's 
longstanding decency standard. In a 1921 landmark case, the House voted to 
censure a member for inserting "foul and obscene matter" into the Congressional 
Record. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said he would take up the matter with the House Committee on Standards 
of Official Conduct, commonly known as the Ethics Committee, if Dannemeyer 
refuses. 
</P>
<P>
In a reply sent to Jacobs on Monday, Dannemeyer said he would "welcome the 
opportunity to more fully discuss the substantive reasons why the subject of my 
text is essential for full public debate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The tens of millions of viewers of C-SPAN (the cable television channel that 
broadcasts congressional proceedings) will benefit greatly from the ensuing 
discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Mero said Dannemeyer is particularly concerned about a legislative effort to 
guarantee gays the same anti-discrimination protections afforded racial 
minorities by the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Such bills are pending in both the 
House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of legislative vehicles (involving homosexual rights) coming 
down the line," Mero said, "and the homosexuals don't want public policy debate 
to focus on what they do. They want it to focus on the abstract nature of civil 
rights. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's not until a family happens to be in the park and the kids stumble upon a 
(homosexual) couple in the bushes somewhere when all of a sudden it hits home 
what they are doing, and what that stands for in society." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Mero said, Dannemeyer "will continue to pursue this approach 
in the future. We will be quite open in explaining what we are talking about." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Jacobs said that he is not supporting the proposed legislation 
and that his quarrel with Dannemeyer is over the forum Dannemeyer chose to 
express his views. "I just don't think it belongs in the Congressional Record," 
Jacobs said.

<P>
A 26-year-old Huntington Beach woman was killed when the vehicle she was riding 
in went off a scenic southern Utah road and crashed, National Park Service 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Eckroth died of injuries suffered in the one-vehicle accident Sunday 
on the Burr Trail, about 40 miles north of the Utah-Arizona state line, said 
Karen Whitney, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Suffering minor injuries in the accident were Michael Sterger, the driver, and 
Gina Sterger, both of Cypress, and Donald Dudrey, 30, of Garden Grove, Whitney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigating officers said the vehicle veered off the dirt road and struck an 
embankment and a large rock, throwing Eckroth from the back seat through the 
front windshield. 
</P>
<P>
Eckroth was given emergency treatment, then flown by helicopter to a Page, 
Ariz., hospital, where she was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
The other three people were treated and released, Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
Eckroth's death was the fifth accidental fatality this year among visitors to 
Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. She was the first to die in a traffic 
accident, Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
Three people, including two children, drowned, and one death was the result of 
a hiker falling from a cliff.

JAPANESE BUY SITE NEAR ANAHEIM STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A six-story office building near Anaheim Stadium has been sold for $19.7 
million to a Japanese company, which plans to add two more office towers to the 
7.6-acre site, negotiators of the deal said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tobishima Development Co. Inc. bought the building on the northwest corner of 
the intersection of Orangewood Avenue and State College Boulevard in Anaheim 
from Connecticut Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
Tobishima, a California subsidiary of Tokyo-based Tobishima Corp., an 
engineering and construction company, already owns four county buildings, all 
in Santa Ana: two office towers at Hutton Centre, the Ebasco Building at 3000 
West MacArthur Boulevard and another at 2020 E. 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kniest, director of marketing/acquisitions for Hutton Development Co., said 
Tobishima plans to build two more high-rises of 10 and 12 stories at the 
Anaheim site. The new buildings will more than quadruple the amount of office 
space to 586,000 square feet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton Development Co. has been a partner with Tobishima Development in its 
county real estate ventures for three years, Kniest said. 
</P>
<P>
Tobishima owns 50% of Hutton Development, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The newly purchased office complex now called State College Plaza will be 
renamed Hutton Stadium Centre, Kniest added. Ground breaking on the 12-story 
building is scheduled for the first quarter of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Kniest said the Anaheim purchase, completed July 12, reflects Tobishima's 
interest in the potential of the central county office market.

MAI TO CONTINUE EFFORTS TO CONTROL PRIME COMPUTER BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
</P>

<P>
Despite being outdone by a rival bidder for Prime Computer Inc., MAI Basic Four 
Inc. says it won't back down from its planned proxy fight to seek control of 
Prime's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
MAI, a Tustin-based computer maker, will try to gain a majority of seats on 
Prime's board during the company's annual shareholders' meeting Wednesday in 
Natick, Mass. But MAI, which tried for eight months to acquire Prime, won't 
have the clout it had earlier in the takeover fight. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, MAI was the lone bidder for Prime and had more than 70% of 
Prime's shares tendered to its offer. But most of the tendered shares were 
withdrawn after Prime accepted a buyout proposal valued at more than $1.4 
billion from J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New York venture-capital firm. Prime's 
directors accepted Whitney's offer as a way of fending off MAI's protracted 
takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
MAI had earlier bid $1.2 billion for Prime. But after an unsuccessful effort to 
raise financing to top the Whitney bid, MAI changed its strategy and offered to 
buy only Prime's minicomputer business for $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's board has said it will consider the MAI offer. Prime's minicomputer 
business accounted for about 33% of its 1988 revenue of $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, MAI said its nominees to Prime's board are committed to selling 
Prime's minicomputer line to MAI under terms of its recent proposal.

TOSHIBA GROWTH IN IRVINE PROCEEDING; 
</P>
<P>
TELEPHONE OPERATION TO MOVE FROM JAPAN LATER IN YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As part of a three-year expansion that will double the size of its Orange 
County operations, Toshiba will transfer production of some business telephone 
products from Japan to Irvine later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The move will create just 40 local jobs in October, but Toshiba's plans call 
for boosting its local employment by 850 positions by the end of 1991, said 
Robert A. Wittenberg, a spokesman for Toshiba America Information Systems Inc., 
an Irvine-based unit of Japan's Toshiba Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last March, Information Systems President Kiichi Hataya 
disclosed a broad plan to expand the company's local operations by moving more 
manufacturing from overseas to Irvine and other Toshiba facilities in the 
United States. On Monday, Toshiba formally announced the latest phase of that 
expansion. The company declined to disclose the size of its investment in the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Oct. 1, the Information Systems unit will move manufacturing of 
private-branch exchange, or PBX, systems and business telephones from Japan to 
Irvine, Hataya said. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the expansion took place in January when Toshiba boosted 
local production of laptop computers and began making cellular mobile 
telephones in Irvine. And in April, it began local production of office 
copiers. 
</P>
<P>
The Information Systems division employs 850 people in Irvine and 1,200 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Hataya said the move is part of a Toshiba program to manufacture more products 
closer to their markets. 
</P>
<P>
"By producing systems in the United States," Hataya said, "we will be far 
better able to maintain inventory control, respond more efficiently to customer 
needs and react with more immediacy to fluctuations in marketplace demand." 
</P>
<P>
Hataya said the expansion is also part of an effort by Toshiba "to demonstrate 
its commitment to the U.S. marketplace" by purchasing more parts and supplies 
for its U.S.-made products from local suppliers.

THEATER AND FILM / JAN HERMAN: GROVE'S CYRANO GLORIES IN 'MOST ROMANTIC PLAY 
EVER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Herman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Michelle Pfeiffer, one of the world's most beautiful actresses, can say she 
is less than happy with her looks because of the way her lips curl downward at 
the corners of her mouth, then it is easy to understand why Cyrano has such a 
profound reaction to his giant-size nose. 
</P>
<P>
That at least is how Charles Lanyer, the star of "Cyrano de Bergerac" at the 
Grove Shakespeare Festival, explains what he believes to be "the universal 
appeal" of Edmond Rostand's crowd-pleasing hero. For it is Cyrano's feelings 
about his appearance, rather than what he actually looks like, that are the 
touchstone to his character and make this grandiose creature one of us. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever run across anybody who was ever satisfied with his 
appearance," Lanyer said. "Most of us feel that no matter what we've been given 
or not been given in the looks department, it somehow isn't right. So Cyrano's 
problem is something everybody identifies with, except that it's exaggerated 
and made quite obvious." 
</P>
<P>
When Cyrano says, "Know that I glory in this nose of mine / For a great nose 
indicates a great man," we realize that he is offering an eloquent bluff. After 
all, the fabled "nose speech" that follows is a preemptive defense. By calling 
his nose everything from "a perch" for birds to "a blue cucumber," he invents a 
string of self-inflicted insults far worse than anything anybody else can hurl 
at him. 
</P>
<P>
But Cyrano's sense of himself as a freak of nature would hardly justify our 
interest by itself. Nor does it entirely explain the play's enduring appeal. 
Although Rostand combines his hero's provocative physical flaws with a 
compensating gift of poetry as wonderfully outsized as his nose, there is 
something else that makes this 90-year-old comedy work. 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply the most romantic play ever written," Lanyer said. "We have here 
a virtually non-stop paean to the glory and the joy, the hope and the 
heartache, of romantic love. What ultimately draws us to Cyrano and makes him 
so poignant is that he is a man who feels unable to achieve life's greatest 
reward because of his disfigured appearance." 
</P>
<P>
The actor, 47, said he has wanted to play the role ever since seeing Jose 
Ferrer's Oscar-winning screen performance many years ago in the 1950 movie of 
"Cyrano de Bergerac." But he never thought he would get to do it because "these 
things are often a matter of chance." Then, during June, director Tom Bradac 
called to offer him the role at the Festival Amphitheatre in Garden Grove after 
Gregory Itzin had to drop out when a television job intervened. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty short notice," said Lanyer, who has played leading roles at 
major West Coast theaters from Seattle to San Diego, including South Coast 
Repertory in Costa Mesa. "I just sat in my living room and stuffed the lines in 
for six or seven days in a row. I wouldn't let myself leave the house until I 
had cracked the back of the material." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most eminent actors of the century have played Cyrano. The 
legendary Constant Coquelin originated the role in 1897 in the first production 
in Paris. Others who have performed Cyrano to great acclaim include Christopher 
Plummer and Derek Jacobi. Oddly, Laurence Olivier, who had a fondness for using 
false noses and would have seemed a natural for Cyrano, never made the role his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to do," said Lanyer, who grew up near Seattle and lives in Los 
Angeles, "is make up your mind you are going to put your heart on your sleeve. 
You have to let everybody see it. You have to make the audience fall in love 
with you. I decided to go out there and be as impassioned and in love and as 
self-sacrificing as I can. That's the nature of the man." 
</P>
<P>
The larger-than-life role also requires a larger-than-life delivery of 
Rostand's elevated language. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to hear the words well-spoken," Lanyer said. "The verse demands it. 
You have to articulate those words in the rhythms imposed by the verse 
structure. If you take pauses in a naturalistic way, the energy of the line is 
destroyed. It's as if you snipped the current. You must sustain the song just 
like a singer who keeps the melody going." 
</P>
<P>
And then, of course, there is the larger-than-life nose. (Ten of them, in 
fact.) Built on the bridge of Lanyer's nose, Cyrano's is a technical marvel so 
sensitive and flexible that it feels like an extension of the actor's own 
</P>
<P>
"It's very comfortable, totally secure," he said. "It has never even threatened 
to come off." 
</P>
<P>
ODD FACTS: "Sunday in the Park With George," which recently closed South Coast 
Repertory's 25th season, clocked in with SCR's most expensive set ever. No 
figures were available. The former record holder was "Golden Girls" (since 
renamed "Going for the Gold"). 
</P>
<P>
So says a booklet of odd facts being prepared for subscribers to the Costa Mesa 
theater. Did you know, for instance, that Shakespeare is South Coast's most 
frequently produced playwright? He has had 11 productions, followed by Moliere 
and Harold Pinter (seven each) and Shaw (six). 
</P>
<P>
Also at South Coast, the Hispanic Playwrights Project has landed Richard 
Beltran for the lead role in Octavio Solis' "Man of Flesh." The play is to 
receive a staged reading Aug. 12. Beltran is one of the stars of the current 
movie, "Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills."

QUARTET PERFORMS AT CENTER TO LAUNCH A POSSIBLE SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prospective chamber music series at Founders Hall in the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center was given its first test on Sunday afternoon by a 
quartet including violinist Mitchell Newman, violist Ralph Fielding, cellist 
Barry Gold -- all members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic -- and pianist Armen 
Guzelimian. Billed by Center officials as "Sundays at Four," it is, so far, 
only Sunday at Four. No other programs have yet been announced. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, one would not expect Founders Hall to be conducive to an 
intimate musical experience. The room is quite stark in appearance -- bare 
walls adorned only by illuminated exit signs, black, scuffed tiles on the 
floor, utilitarian red, white and blue lights hanging from slim metal pipes. On 
this occasion, a small makeshift stage held the three string players; the 
Steinway grand stood on the floor, and wooden risers supported an audience 
seating in the round. 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, not the adornments but the acoustics that determine the 
musical ambiance of a hall. At Founders Hall, the acoustics are lively enough 
to convey nuance at all dynamic levels and through all ranges without being 
troubled by brassiness or distracting reverberation. 
</P>
<P>
Piano quartets by Faure (C minor, Opus 15) and Brahms (G minor, Opus 25) were 
the foursome's vehicle. Considering that this was their first public appearance 
together, the quartet members seemed remarkably comfortable with one another, 
matching warm, vibrant tone, striving with unity toward musical goals. 
</P>
<P>
In the Faure, four colorists drew from the same palette, caressing consecutive 
entrances as they passed the lush, inviting first-movement theme to one 
another, bringing a hymn-like reverence and concentration to the Adagio (after 
which, the delicate intensity of the mood they had created was violated by 
premature applause), sensual focus and excitement to the Allegro molto. 
</P>
<P>
But the Brahms was their tour de force. Here, the strings allowed an edge to 
creep into their tone for Brahmsian brooding, while Guzelimian maintained his 
round, romantic tone throughout. Cellist Gold and violist Fielding took full 
advantage of Brahms' predilection for dark hues in their soulful solo passages. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, the four spun excruciatingly intense long lines in the Andante and 
climbed to a shattering climax in the Allegro. Together, they attacked the 
massive opening of the Gypsy Rondo. Separately, each in turn launched his 
successful assault on frenetic passages in the same movement. 
</P>
<P>
In a seating arrangement for 230, there were 138 apparently grateful witnesses.

PAY PACKAGES FOR O.C. ARTS CENTER ADMINISTRATORS AMONG HIGHEST IN U.S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas R. Kendrick, president of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, and 
his wife, Judith O'Dea Morr, the Center's general manager, are among the 
highest-paid administrators of multipurpose arts facilities in the nation, with 
combined compensation and benefits of more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Individually as well as collectively, Kendrick's and Morr's paychecks and other 
compensations rank just behind those of the two highest-paid administrators at 
New York's Lincoln Center and ahead of those at the Music Center in Los Angeles 
and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, according 
to a survey by The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
<P>
This is despite the fact that, of the seven facilities surveyed, the Orange 
County center has the fewest stages and ranks sixth on the list in the number 
of paid, ticketed performances per season and the number of full-time 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Kendrick and Morr are, by far, the highest-paid arts administrators in 
Orange County, according to information provided to the Internal Revenue 
Service: David Emmes and Martin Benson, the founders and artistic directors of 
the South Coast Repertory Theatre, earn $65,000 each; Louis Spisto, executive 
director of the Pacific Symphony, earns $67,000; and Kevin Consey of Newport 
Harbor Art Museum earns $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick and Morr say they are fairly compensated. And Center board members say 
that at the amount Kendrick and Morr are paid they are a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Information filed with the IRS and the California Registry of Charitable 
Trusts, required for all tax-exempt organizations, indicates that Kendrick was 
paid $184,246 in 1988 and received a benefits package worth an additional 
$6,543, primarily for an annuity plan. This represents an increase of about 9% 
from his reported compensation for 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Morr, who came to Orange County with Kendrick from Washington, where both 
worked as top administrators at the Kennedy Center for nearly a decade, is the 
second highest-paid staff member at the Orange County center, reporting 
earnings of $108,678 and a benefits package of $3,749 for 1988. This is an 
increase of about 6% from her reported compensation for the year before. 
</P>
<P>
At the centers surveyed, none of the job descriptions for the top two 
administrative slots precisely mirrored Kendrick's and Morr's. In principle, 
all chief executives are responsible for everything that goes on in their 
institutions. But according to Kendrick, this is almost literally true for 
himself and Morr in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of the other executives surveyed, Kendrick said, the couple are 
responsible for day-to-day programming, administration, coordination with such 
regional groups as the Pacific Symphony and Opera Pacific, finance and budget 
controls, construction planning and supervision, marketing and media relations. 
(This despite a staff that includes a director of marketing, a director of 
development and a controller.) 
</P>
<P>
Also on the couple's list of responsibilities is fund raising, which now means 
presiding over a greatly expanded development department and an ambitious 
capital campaign to construct new theaters. 
</P>
<P>
At Lincoln Center, although the operating budget is more than twice that of 
Orange County's Center, President Nathan Leventhal is primarily responsible for 
day-to-day operations of the six theater-complex. Financing is handled by the 
highest paid of six vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Leventhal's duties do include overseeing relations with more than half a dozen 
constituent organizations, such as the Metropolitan Opera and the New York 
Philharmonic, some of whose budgets exceed that of Lincoln Center itself, 
according to a center spokeswoman. But unlike Kendrick and Morr, Leventhal and 
his financial vice president have very little involvement with the details of 
marketing or with programming, most of which are handled by the constituent 
organizations themselves or by a lower-ranking center administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Davidson, chairman of the Kennedy Center, oversees programming, fund 
raising and administration. But much of the actual programming is done by Marta 
Istomin, the center's artistic director, according to a center spokeswoman. Top 
administrators at the San Francisco War Memorial and the Wortham Center in 
Houston -- all of whom are city employees and paid much less than Kendrick and 
Morr -- do no programming and very little in the way of budgeting and 
independent marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The two administrators who come closest to Kendrick and Morr in the range of 
day-to-day responsibilities are Lawrence J. Wilker and Art Falco at Playhouse 
Square Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Their combined compensation for 1988 was 
$213,230 -- $89,986 less than Kendrick and Morr's combined total. 
</P>
<P>
But the size of the compensation packages is misleading, Kendrick and Morr said 
in separate interviews, because the figures encompass such things as prorated 
moving and housing compensation and "significant" out-of-pocket contributions 
to disability, health and retirement plans to maintain the generous level of 
coverage they were provided at the Kennedy Center (but which is no longer 
provided to administrators there). The figures also include lease payments for 
the cars provided to the couple by the Center. 
</P>
<P>
When all of these factors are taken into account, Kendrick maintained, his 
effective salary is $166,000; Morr said hers is about $94,000. None of the 
other administrators surveyed would reveal the composition of their 
compensation packages. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're fairly paid," Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Morr said that she, too, is "quite comfortable with my level of compensation." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't move here for pay," but for the challenge of building and shaping a 
new institution, Kendrick added. He also said he prefers to be judged "on the 
basis of the jobs we were brought here to do, and the jobs we have done." 
</P>
<P>
On that basis, Center board members agree that the couple's compensation is not 
out of line. 
</P>
<P>
By many standards used to judge such facilities, Center officials and board 
members said, the Center is a success. It has reached what they consider to be 
"full bookings" three years ahead of schedule. (Center officials say that 
virtually every day not taken up by one of 266 events this year is needed for 
load-in/load-out time.) More than 640,000 people attended performances in 1988, 
compared to 607,000 in 1987. Paid attendance for events programmed by Kendrick 
and Morr (as opposed to booked into the Center by others) was 85%, 20 points 
above the national average. And paid attendance for all performances since the 
Center's opening has been 80%, also well above the national average. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick and Morr are "a great, great bargain for Orange County on the basis of 
what they've produced for us," said Henry Segerstrom, chairman of the Center's 
board. "That's the most significant yardstick for measuring their worth. 
</P>
<P>
"In the area of programming, they have done better than any other executive 
combination in the country," he said, citing the Center's international ballet 
series, which he said is one of the finest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"At almost any price, they're a bargain," agreed Roger Johnson, head of Western 
Digital Corp. in Irvine and the Center's vice chairman for the corporate 
campaign. "They came to a brand-new area with a brand-new facility. I don't 
think anything speaks better than the end result," in terms of paid attendance 
and the quality of the presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Segerstrom, whose fortune was based in part on agriculture, said that comparing 
Kendrick and Morr's compensation to those of other arts center heads is like 
comparing "apples to apricots." For one thing, lower salaries in Cleveland may 
go a lot farther than higher ones in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Differences are especially pronounced, Segerstrom said, between a facility such 
as the Orange County center, which depends entirely on private funding, and 
those that receive a large segment of financial support from government. 
</P>
<P>
Tax support for the arts carries with it considerable accountability and public 
debate, he explained, and salaries generally have to coincide with those of 
other public officials. 
</P>
<P>
Segerstrom further maintained that the size, experience and range of expertise 
of management teams and support staffs vary considerably from center to center, 
affecting the manner in which responsibilities are shouldered and paid for. 
</P>
<P>
In order to judge the cost-effectiveness of Kendrick and Morr's compensation, 
"you have to look at the total executive payroll," Johnson agreed. "We are not 
terribly heavy on staff at the Center." 
</P>
<P>
However, in addition to Kendrick and Morr, the Center reported that 27 other 
employees earned more than $30,000 in 1988. The Los Angeles Music Center listed 
only 11 in that pay range. The corresponding figures at other centers ranged 
from two at the Wortham Center in Houston to 106 at Lincoln Center. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to find an exact comparison for the $73-million Center, which 
has one stage -- Segerstrom Hall -- and 65 full-time employees. The current 
annual budget is $15.4 million, 83% of which comes from earned income -- ticket 
sales and rentals -- with the remaining 17%, or about $2.6 million, coming from 
private support. Apart from its tax-exempt status, the Center has no 
governmental support. 
</P>
<P>
Other institutions surveyed have multiple stages. All but the Wortham in 
Houston have bigger overall staffs and all but the Playhouse Center in 
Cleveland receive some form of governmental support, either funds or services. 
The yearly expenditures vary widely, from $1.67 million at Houston's Wortham 
Center to $75 million at the Los Angeles Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Performing Arts Center presents about 60% of the performances 
at Segerstrom Hall. Similar figures vary widely at centers around the country, 
from Lincoln Center, which presents, sometimes with a co-sponsor, nearly 90% of 
its performances, to the San Francisco War Memorial, which does no presenting 
but instead rents itself out to various organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The number of paid, ticketed performances per year also varies greatly, from 
2,200 at Lincoln Center to 231 at the Wortham. There were 266 such performances 
in 1988 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.

A headine in Saturday editions stated incorrectly that Interior Secretary 
Manuel Lujan Jr. was being asked by critics to resign from a White House task 
force studying offshore oil drilling. As the accompanying story stated, 
California's two senators and 17 of the state's congressmen are demanding that 
Lujan resign as chairman of the group, not from the group itself.

An Antelope Valley water board member pleaded innocent to arson charges after 
his arrest in connection with a fire that heavily damaged his Lancaster home, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn D. Martin, 66, a member of the board of directors of the Antelope 
Valley-East Kern Water Agency, was arrested Monday on suspicion of arson of a 
residential dwelling, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who was released on $10,000 bail after his arraignment, is suspected of 
setting a fire Thursday in his home in the 500 block of East Avenue J, deputies 
said. Damage to the home was estimated at $90,000, and Los Angeles County fire 
reports say an "unauthorized junkyard" on the property hindered efforts to 
extinguish the 3:45 p.m. fire and endangered firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Martin has previously clashed with the city over his practice of storing junk 
metal and other debris on his property, authorities said. Martin could not be 
reached for comment.

<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley today vowed that he would not resign, despite a 
recent allegation that he had a conflict of interest between his private 
finances and his public role. 
</P>
<P>
"To anyone who has any such thoughts, I'll be around here four years from now, 
as mayor of this city," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
A city auditor revealed Monday that someone had tried to "white out" a notation 
indicating that the mayor had directed that city funds be deposited at Far East 
National Bank, which had employed him as an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
But the mayor said today that he did not know why his name appeared to have 
been obliterated on the city treasury document.

Actor Rex Harrison was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at a Buckingham Palace 
ceremony today and said it was "a marvelous moment." 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, he formally will be called Sir Reginald but said he 
preferred Sir Rex, for the nickname he has used throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old actor, best known for his Oscar-winning role as Henry Higgins 
in the movie "My Fair Lady," was awarded the knighthood in recognition of his 
services to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they rather like to leave awarding honors until you get to a certain 
age," he said. "It was a marvelous moment kneeling there and getting tapped on 
each shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Knights must kneel before the queen, who taps them on both shoulders with a 
sword as part of the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, who plans to star in Somerset Maugham's comedy "The Circle" on 
Broadway this fall, said he has no plans to retire because "I wouldn't know 
what to do."

TRUCK CRASHES THROUGH SANTA ANA OFFICE WINDOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Costa was enjoying the quiet as he sat down to type a letter to his 
80-year-old mother this morning, encouraging her to slow down and take care of 
herself. She hadn't been feeling well lately. 
</P>
<P>
It was 9 a.m. at the Santa Ana Restaurant Equipment Co., at 2520 S. Fairview 
Ave., Santa Ana, which Costa owns. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old businessman began pecking away at the electric typewriter keys, 
not knowing how long the lull in activity would last and wanting to write the 
note to his mother, who lives in Kent, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
"I just sat down and I heard this screech outside my window," said Costa. "I 
really did not think too much about it because we hear them all the time out on 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
But what Costa saw next made him think quickly. 
</P>
<P>
A truck sliding on its side came through the plate-glass window where Costa was 
sitting. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the headlights and the front of the truck, and I knew it was not going 
to stop. It looked strange moving on its side. I wanted to get away from the 
flying glass, so I got up and I tripped over a box as I ran away. I fell on the 
floor, and the truck crashed through the window," Costa recalled in a nervous 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup stopped only a few feet from where Costa was working. The desk and 
chair where he had sat were covered with glass and debris. Costa was not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time this sort of thing had happened to the Santa Ana 
Restaurant Equipment Co. Before it moved to its new location on Fairview, an 
intoxicated motorist had driven his car into the front of the building at the 
old location. No one was inside when that happened, Costa said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Costa and other witnesses, the pickup truck and a passenger car 
collided on Fairview and the truck was knocked on its side. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers of the pickup truck and car were not injured, but a passenger in 
the truck was taken to a nearby hospital, witnesses said.

The House Ethics Committee, already studying a complaint against Rep. Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.), may also look into his decision to double the salaries of 
aides who worked on his political campaigns without pay, the committee's senior 
Republican said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to take a look at it. . . . The committee will review it. . . . 
That's all I can say," Rep. John T. Myers (R-Ind.), said. Asked if he had made 
similar pay changes among his staff, he replied, "I sure haven't." 
</P>
<P>
A report in the Washington Times by the Atlanta Business Chronicle said today 
that Gingrich temporarily increased the salaries of two staff members after 
they returned from a leave spent working on his 1988 reelection campaign.

A federal judge today set bail at $10 million for the release of Saudi Arabian 
financier Adnan Khashoggi, charged with aiding former Philippine President 
Ferdinand E. Marcos in a massive real estate fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ruled that Khashoggi, one of the world's richest men who was 
extradited from Switzerland last Wednesday, must remain in New York and wear an 
"unremovable electronic bracelet" attached to his wrist or ankle to monitor his 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge John Keenan said Khashoggi must provide half of the $10 
million in cash or surrender bank books in that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi was also ordered to remain in the New York area and must physically 
report to authorities twice a week and telephone them every day.

A federal judge today granted the request of independent counsel Lawrence E. 
Walsh to dismiss two of the most serious charges against former National 
Security Adviser John M. Poindexter in the Iran-Contra case. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Harold Greene denied a motion by Walsh that he be allowed after the 
trial to again bring the charges -- theft of government property and fraud -- 
against Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh asked last week that the charges be dropped to avoid delaying the trial 
over the use of sensitive national security secrets. Greene said it would not 
be fair to Poindexter to drop the charges now with the possibility of raising 
them again. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Poindexter) would have to wait in a state of uncertainty and under public 
obloquy for an indefinite period of time until the government decided that, 
somehow, for some reason, the time had become more propitious for proceeding 
with a trial on the second half of the charges," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter still faces separate charges of lying to Congress and obstructing 
the congressional Iran-Contra investigation in his trial, due to start this 
fall.

Talks among Cambodia's four warring factions broke down at their first session 
today with the resistance coalition saying it will not return to the 
negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
"The division is more serious than ever," resistance leader Prince Norodom 
Sihanouk said after he and his two allies met with Vietnamese-backed Cambodian 
Prime Minister Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no point coming back tomorrow. . . . We said everything we need to 
say to each other," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have been blocked by demands from the ultra- leftist Khmer Rouge 
for a share in running the country where an estimated 1 million people died 
during its previous rule from 1975 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The four factions met in an effort to resolve internal Cambodian problems 
before a French-sponsored, 20-nation peace conference this weekend.

A pilot trying to re-enact the first flight across the English Channel on its 
80th anniversary was forced to ditch her plane just two miles short of the 
British coast today. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Pullan was commemorating French aviator Louis Bleriot's July 25, 1909, 
flight from Calais, France, to Dover in an authentic Bleriot XI monoplane, the 
same type used for his crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"I took off from Calais, and it was a beautiful flight until I started losing 
power," she said. "Gradually the aircraft went down, and I had to ditch in the 
sea about two miles off Dover." 
</P>
<P>
Pullan, 36, was rescued by a Royal Air Force helicopter after being in the 
water for three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
She was taken to a field atop the famous White Cliffs of Dover where a large 
welcoming party was waiting on the spot where Bleriot landed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so sad," she said. "I think the aircraft has been lost. I was enjoying 
it so much, and I would do it again any time. I am sorry I could not bring the 
airplane in to land for the official reception."

'BIG-TICKET' ORDERS UP ONLY A SLIM 0.3%

<P>
Orders for "big-ticket" durable goods rebounded a smaller-than-expected 0.3% in 
June after a steep fall in May, the Commerce Department said today, providing a 
fresh sign that the economy is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
The June rise came after a revised 4.4% fall in May. Economists, figuring that 
durable goods orders would rebound from May's depressed level, had projected a 
much stronger gain of 1% or more. 
</P>
<P>
The June rate was lifted by orders for machinery and electrical equipment and 
offset by falling orders for metals and transportation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The orders received by factories for long-lasting manufactured goods inched up 
$400 million to a seasonally adjusted $124.1 billion in June from the prior 
month. The orders were 1% below last year's level. 
</P>
<P>
The slack orders figure adds to the growing list of reports showing a general 
slowdown in the economy. Retail sales also have been weak, industrial 
production has fallen for two months in a row and the trade deficit jumped 24% 
in May, swelled in part by a slowdown in exports. 
</P>
<P>
The modest rebound in durable-goods orders is unlikely to persuade economists 
that "big-ticket" sales, one of the most interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the 
economy because buyers must usually borrow to purchase them, are breaking out 
of their recent sluggish pattern. 
</P>
<P>
The durable-goods report, despite the slight overall rise, contained a number 
of signs of weakness. Shipments fell 1.1% in June to $121.6 billion, the fifth 
decline this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although unfilled orders were 10.9% higher than in June, 1988, showing that 
factories still have plenty of work on hand, the increase in June from the 
previous month was only 0.5% and was limited to a few industries. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding orders received by defense contractors, which tend to be erratic from 
month to month, orders in June fell 0.7%, the department said.

TEENS TARGETED IN TOBACCO ADS, MODEL TESTIFIES

<P>
A model who for six years was Winston's answer to the macho "Marlboro man" 
urged Congress today to take the glamour out of tobacco advertisements, saying 
teen-agers are the target of the ads. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had children tell me that they smoked Winstons so that they could be 
just like me," David Goerlitz told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. 
"For that I shall always feel guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Goerlitz described himself as a 25-year, three-pack-a-day smoker who kicked the 
habit in November. He has worked for private groups that fight smoking-related 
illnesses and his testimony was intended to bolster legislation sponsored by 
Rep. Thomas A. Luken (D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ad Ban Sought 
</P>
<P>
Luken, on a self-described crusade "to reduce cigarette smoking to zero," wants 
to ban all tobacco ads that might be seen by youths. 
</P>
<P>
"When I modeled for Winston, I was told very clearly that young people were the 
market we were after," Goerlitz said. "The other models and I were depicted as 
young and daring buddies, and that's what young people relate to at 14 or 15 
years old." 
</P>
<P>
The ads showed cigarette-smoking members of a search-and-rescue squad, dangling 
from helicopters and hanging from cliffs to rescue stricken climbers. 
</P>
<P>
Luken's bill calls for stripping billboards and printed ads of everything but 
printed words, and banning tobacco ads from all sports facilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Job Loss Predicted 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom to Advertise Coalition, representing six advertising trade 
organizations, released results of a study predicting Luken's legislation would 
put 62,992 people out of work if it became law. It said jobs would be lost in 
retail trade, outdoor advertising, direct mail advertising, newspapers, 
magazines and printing. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition and the American Civil Liberties Union also argued against the 
bill on constitutional grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Whitley, spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, said the legislation 
"rests on the false premise that cigarette advertising is responsible for 
smoking by young people and that young people would not begin smoking if 
cigarette advertising were banned."

International Business Machines Corp. will take over the management of most of 
Eastman Kodak Co.'s data-processing operations, the companies said today. 
</P>
<P>
IBM will manage Kodak's computers from a new data center at Kodak headquarters 
in Rochester, N.Y. The value of the deal for IBM was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement is intended to save money for Kodak, which said Monday that it 
would take a $225 million charge against second-quarter earnings and was 
disappointed with its operating results. 
</P>
<P>
IBM approached Kodak with the proposal, said David E. McDowell, the president 
of IBM's National Service Division. IBM has been trying to lessen its 
dependence on sales of computer hardware and software and instead become a 
"partner" with its customers, embedding itself deeply in their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The Kodak deal is by far the biggest yet in which IBM actually takes over the 
support for a company's data-processing operation, McDowell said. As such, it 
could lead to other arrangements of similar magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
The partners envision that IBM could eventually take over management of data 
processing at other centers in the United States that are excluded from the 
first phase as well as overseas locations, said Katherine M. Hudson, Kodak's 
director of corporate information systems.

Major oil companies took advantage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska to 
increase profits, Massachusetts Energy Secretary Sharon Pollard said today in a 
report investigating a 36-cent per gallon wholesale gasoline price hike. 
</P>
<P>
But the Massachusetts Petroleum Council insisted that the price increases 
stemmed from higher production costs that had been working their way through 
the system since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries production 
cutback of November, 1988. The council also said that changes in the gasoline 
formula mandated by environmental officials also played a key role in the price 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Pollard's 38-page report, based on a series of public hearings, charged that 
the March spill of millions of gallons of crude oil in Alaska's Prince William 
Sound did not cause a supply disruption sufficient to justify the rapid and 
sudden gasoline price hike. 
</P>
<P>
It charged that retail service station operators generally did not share in the 
profits from the soaring gasoline prices. And the report charged the new 
environmental standards were responsible for at most an additional 1 to 3 cents 
per gallon.

"Our boxer, who was operated on Tuesday morning, will not be able to go back

Belbouli was scheduled to defend his title against American Robert Daniels in

A former Creighton University basketball player who claimed that he was 
functionally illiterate when he left the school in 1982 has filed a lawsuit 
alleging that educators there failed to adequately teach him. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed by Kevin Ross also accuses the Omaha, Neb., university of 
breach of contract and seeks an unspecified amount of damages. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, whose problems gained national attention, contends in the lawsuit that 
Creighton recruited him when it knew or should have known that he was 
"ill-equipped and unable to successfully participate" in the school's 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was processed in Cook County Circuit Court on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, 30, also alleges that Creighton enrolled him in Chicago's Westside 
Preparatory School, a noted private elementary and high school, but failed to 
monitor his progress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second-Grade Level 
</P>
<P>
Ross read at a second-grade level when he entered Westside in 1982 but after 
eight months under the tutelage of educator Marva Collins, his reading level 
increased to that of a high school senior. 
</P>
<P>
A television movie was made documenting his efforts at Westside, but according 
to the lawsuit, Creighton was negligent by not placing Ross in a proper adult 
education program. 
</P>
<P>
It further alleges that Creighton's negligence led Ross to suffer severe 
depression, illustrated by a July 23, 1987, incident in which he barricaded 
himself in a Chicago motel room and tossed furniture and other items out the 
window. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was "a manifestation of this depression," the lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Creighton officials could not be reached for comment early today. In February, 
the Rev. Michael Morrison, university president, said he was still haunted by 
Ross's plight. 
</P>
<P>
"When will Kevin go away?" Morrison asked a student who had mentioned seeing an 
article about Ross. "Oh, my God, I wish I knew."

Pirates first baseman Gary Redus was released from a Pittsburgh hospital this 
morning after being struck in the face by a fastball thrown by Dodgers reliever 
Tim Crews. 
</P>
<P>
Redus crumpled to the ground after being struck just below the left eye by a 
Crews pitch clocked at 90 m.p.h. in the seventh inning of the Pirates' 7-4 
victory Monday night. (Earlier story in Sports, Part III.) 
</P>
<P>
He was carried off the field on a stretcher and was taken to Allegheny General 
Hospital for X-rays after his left eye nearly swelled shut. After being 
examined by team physician Dr. Jack Failla, Redus was released, according to 
hospital spokeswoman Mary Barnyak. 
</P>
<P>
Redus apparently did not suffer any broken bones, but his status was uncertain 
for the Pirates' seven-game road trip that begins tonight in New York, Failla 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Redus, batting .280 with three homers and 18 RBIs in 65 games, was 1-for-2 with 
an RBI single Monday.
