BRANDO'S SON ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL FOR MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: DEFENDANT IS QUOTED AS SAYING, 'DEATH IS TOO GOOD FOR THE GUY.' JUDGE 
SETS BAIL AT $10 MILLION.

Marlon Brando's son was ordered Tuesday to stand trial for first-degree murder 
in the shooting of his half sister's lover after a prosecutor quoted Christian 
Brando as saying of the victim: "Death is too good for the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Bail for Brando, who has been jailed since his arrest on the night of the 
slaying, was set at $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge Larry Fidler, who listened to two days of testimony 
about the slaying of Dag Drollet, said his only decision was whether a 
suspicion remained that Brando committed murder, rather than manslaughter, the 
charge on which his lawyer sought to have him tried. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear to me from the evidence presented that the district attorney 
has certainly met the burden of proof," the judge said. "There has been a 
killing and the defendant pulled the trigger." 
</P>
<P>
Fidler ordered Brando, a 32-year-old welder, to appear Aug. 7 for arraignment 
in Superior Court on one count of murder and one count of possession of an 
illegal weapon, an assault rifle. That weapon was not used in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers had asserted that the May 16 shooting in Marlon Brando's home 
in the Santa Monica Mountains was a tragic accident that arose from a struggle 
for a gun or, at worst, the result of Christian Brando's drunken rage upon 
learning that his pregnant sister had been physically abused by Drollet. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Barshop argued: "This is not a struggle; this is 
not a fight. This is nothing but murder." 
</P>
<P>
Barshop read to the judge a lengthy statement made by the defendant to the 
first police officer who arrived at the Brando estate. 
</P>
<P>
"I shot him, man, but not on purpose," Brando said. "It was an accident. The 
gun was under the couch. I kept it there." 
</P>
<P>
At another point, he said: "I did it because he hurt my sister. . . . He was 
laying on the couch. He was fighting with my sister. I said, 'You leave my 
sister alone. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
"We were both in a rage. The (expletive) gun went off." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Brando conceded to the officer that he did not like Drollet and 
declared: "Man, death is too good for the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Brando, who sat stone-faced in the front row throughout the hearing next 
to his younger son, Miko, left without comment through a rear entrance, 
avoiding reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Drollet's father, sitting nearby, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando told arresting officers that Drollet, 26, was shot 
accidentally as the two men wrestled over a pistol in the den. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Robert Shapiro, told Fidler Tuesday, "This case, at most, is a 
manslaughter." The lawyer said his client reacted the way any brother would 
after his sister, Cheyenne, 20, who was nearly nine months pregnant, told him 
at dinner on the night of the shooting that Drollet had beat her. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to go to this person and say, 'Hey, man, lay off my sister,' " 
Shapiro said, and during the confrontation, "the gun was discharged." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence that Brando was legally intoxicated hours after his arrest also 
indicates he was too drunk to form the "specific intent" to kill needed to 
prove murder, the defense attorney argued. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said Tuesday that Marlon Brando left the room where the shooting 
occurred undisturbed for two months, delaying plans to briefly turn it into a 
shrine to Drollet. "He wanted to light a candle . . . then clean up the blood 
and the residue and go on with his life," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors may have a hard time winning a first-degree murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
About a month after the shooting, Cheyenne Brando left for Tahiti, where both 
she and Drollet were born, and has been medically and physically unable to 
return to testify, leaving prosecutors with only her initial statements. 
</P>
<P>
And Fidler ruled Tuesday that those statements are inadmissible. The judge 
agreed with the defense that substituting a statement for Cheyenne's in-person 
testimony would deprive the defense of the constitutional right to 
cross-examine and confront an accuser. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors suffered another setback Monday when Fidler ruled that Christian 
Brando's tape-recorded interview with Los Angeles police detectives after his 
arrest cannot be used against him. Fidler agreed with defense attorneys that a 
detective erred in reading Brando's Miranda rights by not fully informing him 
of his constitutional right to an attorney.

Taking irreverent note of the opening of the Nixon Library, Dodds Book Shop in 
Long Beach featured numerous books by and about the controversial former 
President on its main display table. Also included was a tome entitled "Lying 
-- Moral Choice in Public and Private Life." 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is known for its neutrality, so it came as a bit of surprise when 
more than 200 people began shouting in the county Board of Supervisors chambers 
during a ceremony honoring Leo Renggli, that nation's consul general. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the timing was just a coincidence. The demonstrators, who were county 
employees, had gathered at that moment to protest a plan to charge them from 
$55 to $120 a month for parking. Previously, they docked their cars for free. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen sheriff's deputies came forward to persuade the chanters to 
leave rather than face arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The protest didn't seem to move the supervisors. After the outburst, their next 
bit of business was to honor a beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
Muscle Beach -- just south of the Santa Monica Pier -- was the home of 
musclemen, musclewomen, aerial artists and jugglers until 1959. Then the City 
Council, uncomfortable with (if not jealous of) the performers' worldwide fame, 
had the equipment and platforms torn out after the arrest of a couple of 
weightlifters on a morals charge. 
</P>
<P>
But, of course, the name never died. Images of the area's glory days are 
preserved in an annual pictorial calendar ($5) published by the Santa 
Monica-based Muscle Beach Alumni Assn. Memories can't be banned.

Ma Maison's Patrick Terrail begins the July edition of his newsletter, Les 
Nouvelles Gourmandes, with this emotional plea:

"The summer has arrived and we will all be going to various destinations to 
seek a change from the L.A. traffic as well as the smog. Before you all go to 
(sic) far, do not forget that you can eat wonderfully well in L.A. and 
therefore save a lot of money on airplane ticket AND SUPPORT YOUR LCOAL 
RESTAURANTS.

No surprise to hear that Dennis Conner, the America's Cup-winning yachtsman, 
will be at a celebration involving boats Aug. 2.

<P>
But in West Covina? 
</P>
<P>
Yup. Conner's hosting the opening of the Lakes office complex, which includes a 
shallow, man-made lake. There'll even be a demonstration of radio-controlled 
miniature boats. Let's hope there isn't another controversy over the hulls.

FLAW IN HUBBLE TELESCOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Astronomers, among others, like to talk about parity in discussing physical 
systems; mirror images of stuff or even their properties. 
</P>
<P>
It looks as though the Hubble Telescope is a clear confirmation that the much 
sought after serendipity in scientific investigations obeys parity. I doubt 
that there has been a more clear example of not "finding valuable or agreeable 
things not sought for"; negative serendipity, that is. Or is it 
anti-serendipity? I forget.

FLAW IN HUBBLE TELESCOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Simple Test Would Have Found Flaw in Hubble Telescope," Part A, 
July 10: 
</P>
<P>
Grinding, polishing and optically figuring a telescope mirror is as much an art 
as a science. The Hubble mirror apparently suffers from a defect known to 
amateur telescope builders as a "turned down edge," which can be detected with 
test equipment not much more elaborate than a flashlight, three razor blades, 
and some masking tape. 
</P>
<P>
It seems astonishing that the superb opticians at Perkin-Elmer could have 
certified a mirror with this defect. I suspect that in NASA's zeal to use 
state-of-the-art technology, the trained eye of the optician was not deemed a 
sufficiently objective tool. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than wait three years for a new camera that may or may not correct the 
problem, NASA officials should consider the possibility of sending a shuttle 
crew to mount a mask on the telescope tube to "stop down" the aperture so that 
the defective edge of the mirror is hidden. This could have the effect of 
turning a mediocre 94-inch mirror into a superb 80-inch one. It's an 
unglamorous fix, and would work only if the mirror's edge is indeed turned, but 
it could salvage most of Hubble's mission. The mask should be taken as a backup 
option in case the modified camera can't correct the distortion.

BLUE LINE OPENS FOR LOS ANGELES AREA COMMUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Permit me to describe my day, July 18. I am a lawyer with a fairly busy 
appointment calendar. I had an appointment at the Compton Courthouse at 8:30 
a.m., but then a light day back at the office on Wilshire Boulevard. I live in 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
I drove to the office with my law partner. We arrived at 7:15 a.m. I then 
walked one block to catch an air-conditioned bus, which transported me to 
Wilshire and Figueroa. Upon my arrival, I walked one block to Figueroa and 7th 
Street. I jumped on a sleek, air-conditioned shuttle bus for a short trip to 
Pico and Flower. To these eyes, which were born in Santa Monica, raised and 
strained in a car on a freeway, the sight of a Bay Area-type transit terminal, 
with gleaming signs, freshly painted fences and smiling transit workers was 
something for the ages. I approached the new train car, found an empty seat and 
thanked the heavens again for air-conditioning. It was just 7:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
As we proceeded along the tracks, I saw the jealousy written on the faces of 
already weary motorists along Washington Boulevard. We passed through some 
areas of town I rarely see. I had never seen the Watts Towers before. At 
precisely 8:30 a.m. we rolled into the Compton Station. I walked to the 
courthouse and 1 hour later, business completed, I made my way back to the 
train station. I waited just 5 minutes, caught an amazingly full train, and 
proceeded in comfort back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I got back to Pico and Flower, feeling refreshed and relaxed. My limo (I'm 
sorry, shuttle) was waiting to take me to Figueroa and 7th, and to my Wilshire 
bus for the trip back to the office. I put in a usual day at the office, then 
proceeded to take a freeway flyer bus to the Valley where I made a smooth 
connection to a bus that dropped me off 650 feet from my home. 
</P>
<P>
No, I cannot take public transit every day. For the sake of all of us in this 
urban soup, I ask but one small favor of my fellow city or suburban dwellers. I 
did my part on July 18, and yes, I even rather enjoyed it. When I rejoin the 
mad freeway rush, won't someone else take my place on the bus or train. Who 
knows, maybe someday we will once again see 35 miles per hour on the Hollywood 
Freeway between 7 and 9 a.m.

RULES OF THE GAME PREORDAIN A STANDSTILL; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: WITH THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE IN OPPOSITE CAMPS AND A TWO-THIRDS 
VOTE REQUIRED, STALEMATE IS INEVITABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER A. ZELMAN, Walter A. Zelman is former executive director of 
California Common Cause. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sacramento's budget stalemate is becoming a true governmental crisis. Bills and 
salaries are going unpaid. Public confidence in state government -- already at 
dangerously low levels -- continues to sink. Some of California's most needy 
citizens are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, no excuse for breakdowns of this magnitude. But there is 
more than enough blame to go around. And while the Legislature will inevitably 
absorb most of the public's and media's condemnation, considerable blame rests 
with others playing the budget game and, just as important, with the rules of 
the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, who must sign the budget, has again proven himself to 
be the toughest (many would say most stubborn) of negotiators. He has continued 
to oppose any budget containing tax increases, demanding that the state's 
$3.6-billion shortfall to be erased exclusively, or almost so, by budget cuts, 
with severe impact on many Democratic-backed programs -- education, housing, 
health and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, Deukmejian's cuts-only approach is unacceptable to many 
Democrats, especially those who view the needy as a core constituency. For 
these Democrats to accede to Deukmejian's demands entails a far greater 
concession than they have requested of him. 
</P>
<P>
But our state Constitution, which dictates key rules of the budget game, must 
also bear considerable blame for the crisis. It demands that the budget be 
approved by a two-thirds vote in both legislative houses. Californians may be 
enamored with this supposed protection against irresponsible government action. 
But the super-majority rule may just as easily produce giveaway and pork-barrel 
programs designed to draw additional support for legislators, or minority 
rather than majority rule, or stalemate -- that is, no rule at all. 
</P>
<P>
Especially in California, where parties are loose confederations rather than 
monolithic juggernauts, the effort to pass significant legislation of any kind 
is a formidable undertaking. Majorities must be built and sustained in several 
different committees, and in the Senate and the Assembly, and in the governor's 
office. Demanding that the state's most comprehensive and controversial 
political act be approved by a two-thirds vote is to guarantee, at best, 
lowest-common-denominator politics. At worst, it is an invitation to government 
stalemate and breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
Even in good economic years, when projected revenues exceed expenditures, and 
when the budgetary question is what to add, the two-thirds vote requirement 
still makes stalemate a likely outcome. But in bad years, when revenues fall 
below anticipated expenditures, and when the focus is on cuts rather than 
additions, stalemate is almost inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
The two-thirds vote requirement also favors unaccountable over accountable 
government. By demanding the ultimate in consensus-building, it produces the 
minimum in public accountability. When the 1991 budget is finally approved, 
almost every politician involved will be able to say -- "Don't blame me. I 
didn't like it, but I had to vote for it." Government would be far more 
accountable and understandable if its actions more clearly defined who 
supported and who opposed an act, or, from the public's point of view, 
apportioned clear credit or blame. 
</P>
<P>
The electorate, too, must accept some blame for the current, and recurring, 
budget crises. As if to express their fear of governors and government, voters 
continue to put the executive branch in one party's hands and the legislative 
branch in the other's. Many might view this checks-and-balances, power-sharing 
approach to government as part of the genius of our California and American 
systems. Our governmental processes were designed to promote limited, 
compromise-oriented government. And they do. But when carried to extremes, as 
in California's two-thirds rule, the price is often stalemate and the inability 
of government to adequately address critical public needs. 
</P>
<P>
So while we blame our government for being unacceptably late in producing a 
budget, we would be wise to consider the difficulty of the task. We may not 
wish to praise the failure. But we should not be surprised by it.

IT'S THE SENATE'S JOB TO PRY FROM SOUTER WHETHER HE'LL DEPART FROM

<TEXT>
<P>
The President who has now nominated the unknown Judge David H. Souter to the 
nation's highest court is the man who cavalierly put Dan Quayle a heartbeat 
from the nation's highest political office. So it is only prudent to insist 
that Souter bear the burden of proving that he is not a Quayle -- not a cipher 
recklessly miscast for Bush's political convenience. 
</P>
<P>
The convenience is as obvious as Souter's qualifications, obscure. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980 primaries, Bush said of the 1973 abortion ruling (Roe vs. 
Wade): "I happen to think it was right." His political situation, and hence his 
convictions, soon changed: He said the 1973 ruling was so wrong that the 
Constitution should be amended to change it. Republicans used the abortion 
issue to energize a particular constituency. But public opinion has changed, so 
Republican convictions are changing. And at this awkward moment, Bush has had 
to nominate a justice. 
</P>
<P>
Bush says he has not asked Souter what he thinks about Roe vs. Wade, which 
means about the precedents that produced the "privacy right" that produced Roe 
vs. Wade. Bush either is not telling the truth or is telling a terrible truth 
about himself -- that he is willing to buy, and is asking the Senate to buy, a 
pig in a poke. 
</P>
<P>
The White House waffle is: Abortion is just one subject, not a litmus test. The 
real test is Souter's commitment not to legislate social preferences under the 
guise of construing the Constitution. But the most efficient way of 
ascertaining Souter's conception of the job is by asking what he thinks of the 
reasoning in Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Many senators hoped for a nominee whose views on contentious issues are not, as 
Robert Bork's were, well-known. But senators should not permit any nominee's 
reticence to survive the confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
It would be improper to ask Souter, "What are your views about abortion?" But 
it would be irresponsible not to ask, "What do you think of the constitutional 
reasoning that resulted in creation of a privacy right that includes a right to 
abortion?" It is as proper to ask a nominee's opinion of the reasoning behind 
Roe vs. Wade as it would be to ask about the reasoning behind Brown vs. Board 
of Education. 
</P>
<P>
No nominee should be asked about pending cases. However, any nominee should be 
required to reveal the caliber of his or her mind by discussing the reasoning 
in important past cases, including those concerning capital punishment. That 
subject illustrates the anti-constitutional jurisprudence of Justice William J. 
Brennan Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Because Brennan opposed capital punishment, he declared it unconstitutional. 
The Constitution in several provisions accepts such punishment, so Brennan said 
that such punishment has lately become "cruel and unusual" because of America's 
"evolving standards of decency." But Brennan's supposedly empirical claim 
foundered on a fact: The public's notion of decency, expressed in polls and 
reflected in states' laws, favors capital punishment. So Brennan argued that 
the Constitution defends human dignity, and justices can say what that 
requires, regardless of the original intention of constitutional language or 
today's democratic choices. Souter should be required to say what he thinks 
about Brennan's reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
Souter should also be forced to be forthcoming on the subject of previous cases 
involving race-conscious government policies. Brennan wrote one of the crucial 
opinions affirming the constitutionality of today's racial spoils system. He 
helped transform the 1964 Civil Rights Act into a law creating special 
entitlements for government-approved minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his equally nervous and calculating minions argue, ludicrously, that 
it is fair to inquire about Souter's "intellect" and "judicial temperament" 
but, golly gracious, it would be "inappropriate" to seek Souter's opinion about 
the only matters that can definitively reveal his intellect and temperament. 
These matters include the court's arguments in the broad range of landmark 
cases that have reduced constitutional law to its current sorry condition.

TRYING TO SPOT A PROGRAMMING TREND

During a week in which 47% of the prime-time audience was doing its viewing 
somewhere other than the three major networks, the top-rated program was a 
Canadian TV movie and two others in the Top Five were news products. Does this 
indicate viewers' hunger for fresh programming? Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' new series "Northern Exposure" lost its time slot to a rerun of "L.A. 
Law," finishing 38th among the week's 89 prime-time programs; the debut of CBS' 
"Top Cops" series ranked 43rd, and ABC's first-run game show "Monopoly" placed 
74th. The weekly Nielsen ratings, released Tuesday, showed NBC on top by a 
comfortable margin, with CBS second and ABC third. ABC was first among the 
network evening newscasts, however, with CBS second and NBC third. The full 
list of ratings is on page 10. 
</P>
<P>
* Viewers particularly avoided CBS' new series "Wish You Were Here." The 
premiere last Friday drew an audience of about 4.2 million homes, compared to 
about 9.7 million for a rerun of ABC's "Just the 10 of Us" and about 6.2 
million for a repeat of NBC's "The Yellow Rose." "Wish You Were Here" placed 
83rd overall.

New Teacher for the Class: British comedian Billy Connolly will be the new head 
of the class in the ABC series "Head of the Class." 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. Television, the show's producer, announced Tuesday that Connolly 
will star as the history teacher as the show goes into production Aug. 2 for 
the fall season. Connolly plays an exchange teacher from Scotland as he 
replaces the Charlie Moore character played by Howard Hesseman in the class for 
gifted students. The series also stars Robin Givens, Khrystyne Haje and others.

Mural Won't Make Festival: The restoration of David Alfaro Siqueiros' "Tropical 
America" mural in Olvera Street -- which is being billed as "an image for the 
entire Los Angeles Festival" -- will not take place until long after the 
September arts festival, according to the Friends of Mexico, which is actually 
undertaking the project with the J. Paul Getty Museum. Spokeswoman Miriam 
Bertram said that the city's uncertainty surrounding future plans for Olvera 
Street has delayed work on the mural which was commissioned in 1932, but 
covered with a coat of white paint two years later because it was seen by many 
as Communist propaganda. Bertram said that "end painting" on the mural -- which 
depicted a crucified Mexican with a huge eagle perched above him on the cross 
-- is now scheduled for January, 1991. BETH KLEID

GRAHAM TO THE RESCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Graham didn't take any solos at downtown Los Angeles' Grand Avenue Bar 
on Monday night, but -- for the first set, at least -- he was the most valuable 
musician on stage. 
</P>
<P>
When freeway gridlock delayed two of the trumpet players in the Tom Kubis big 
band, lead trumpeter Graham suddenly found himself leading a two-man, rather 
than the usual four-man, section. Without blinking an eye (or tightening his 
lip) Graham steamed ahead on Kubis' powerful charts, firing out impassioned 
high-note trumpet lines. Except for a few odd closing notes here and there, 
Graham's playing masterfully compensated for the other missing parts. 
</P>
<P>
Kubis, a veteran tenor saxophonist-composer, has been working his band mostly 
in the Orange County area with a rotating group of personnel. His charts -- 
which frequently use standard chord changes and playful name variations 
("Purple Porpoise Parkway" for "Green Dolphin Street" is a good example) -- are 
crisp and swinging. Written from a horn player's point of view, they flow with 
tremendous urgency and drive. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the opening set was a romping excursion through Kubis' "Samba 
Dees Godda Do It," with wildly exploratory solos by Clay Jenkins on trumpet and 
Mike Fahn on trombone. Typically, the soloists were energized by the surging 
ensemble passages of Kubis' arrangement, which -- as in all his charts -- 
superbly linked written passages with improvised solos. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as good was a ballad, "Just A Pretty Little Thing," with a thoughtful 
fluegelhorn solo by Dan McGurn, and the hard-driving (and whimsically titled) 
"Exactly Like This." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the trumpet section had filled out, Graham's stalwart lead work had 
saved the evening. It was to his credit, as well as to the finely crafted Kubis 
arrangements, that a potentially problematic situation turned out to be one 
more example of the way in which good music, and good jazz, can prevail.DON

SUSPENSEFUL MOUNTAIN MAYHEM IN "SNOW KILL" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you can bear with the preposterous plot turns in "Snow Kill" (at 9 tonight 
on cable's USA Network), you might find the murder, terror and suspense in a 
bloody winter wonderland the ticket to chill a summer night. 
</P>
<P>
David Dukes' wry killer, quick with a quip, is the show's throttle. Terence 
Knox as a vengeful mountain trapper and Patti D'Arbanville as a steely 
executive on a wilderness expedition are the heroes. 
</P>
<P>
The script, by producer Raymond Hartung and Harv Zimmel, tightens the noose 
around three disparate groups of people: a trio of escaped convicts, a mountain 
man and his pregnant wife and five fast-track executives on a crazed wilderness 
hike to test their mettle. The action converges on beautiful, rugged, snowy 
mountainsides (the show was shot in Utah), and the point-blank carnage is 
graphic and brutal. 
</P>
<P>
Director Thomas J. Wright and editor Tom Pryor know how to maneuver the violent 
slopes, from breakneck mayhem (as when one of the villains is dropped by a 
crossbow arrow to the throat) to mayhem that is felt but not dramatized (the 
slaughter of the pregnant wife in a mountain cabin, only her naked legs visible 
behind a bed). 
</P>
<P>
The story's undeniable momentum clouds outrageous plot spins: twice Dukes' 
killer fouls up easy chances to finish off Knox's hero; later the hero has the 
villain wallowing in a gorge but inexplicably fails to get out his crossbow and 
nail him. Finally, when the trapper again has the menacing Dukes cowering, the 
D'Arbanville character (whom mad dog Dukes just tried to rape) talks the 
trapper out of it on the inane logic that they need him alive. 
</P>
<P>
That may be cynical -- any loophole to keep the narrative going -- but it's 
also not a sin for a pulp horror story. You do get hooked. And Dukes' 
inevitable demise is truly the stuff of Grand Guignol. RAY LOYND

SMITHSONIAN'S 'QUANTUM' EXPLORES THE UNIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Quantum Universe" is a gutsy attempt to make quantum mechanics -- the 
mental equivalent of a jawbreaker: difficult to crack -- accessible. It doesn't 
always succeed -- or, in some instances, even come close -- but it is pretty 
good viewing nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with the principle that physics is fundamental to everything, this 
season's final episode of "Smithsonian World" (airing at 9 tonight on Channel 
28) mixes mesmerizing graphics, brief on-target interviews, excerpts from a Tom 
Stoppard play ("Hapgood," acted by Roger Rees) and precise narration from 
11-year-old Heidi Brown to get to the essential elements of the theory of 
randomness, of the potential over the actual. 
</P>
<P>
The gimmick of using an 11-year-old narrator would quickly cloy if not for the 
excellence of Brown's work -- and the guiding hand of her mother, "Quantum" 
producer-director Sandra Wentworth Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"Quantum" covers all the Big Questions that this upstart little theory from the 
'30s raises, but there are some serious gaps. The clash between relativity 
theory and quantum mechanics is not adequately explored, for one. There is no 
mention of the work of Stephen Hawking, perhaps the greatest living physicist, 
and his attempt to explain everything by uniting these two seemingly 
incompatible theories. 
</P>
<P>
"The Quantum Universe" is an engrossing, occasionally dazzling mix of science 
and art. Does it succeed in its goal? Well, you'll know far more about quantum 
mechanics by the end of the hour than you did going in, but the universe will 
still be a riddle wrapped in a mystery. As one astrophysicist says, "We talk 
about objects like quarks and gluons, which can't be observed, because they're 
a way of making sense out of what we can observe." MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

ATTEMPT TO HELP WAS FINAL ACT BY GOOD SAMARITAN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: GARY SMITH WON THE HEARTS OF THE COMMUNITY FOR RUSHING TO THE AID OF A 
WOMAN WHO HAD CONFRONTED A BURGLAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scripps Memorial Hospital for the first time flew the flag at half-staff 
Tuesday for one of its own patients, to honor a 35-year-old man who died of 
gunshot wounds after attempting to stop a burglar in University City. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Smith, a North Park carpet layer, died Tuesday morning. He had been shot 
four times with a small-caliber handgun last Wednesday after he responded to a 
woman's screams for help after she confronted a burglar in her home. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all devastated," said a prepared statement by the Smith family. "His 
death is not fair because he was so good, and he was only trying to help. We do 
want to thank the people of San Diego for all the cards, letters and 
contributions sent to us. We really appreciate everyone's concern." 
</P>
<P>
For the past week, cards and flowers poured into Scripps Memorial Hospital in 
La Jolla, some from friends and neighbors, but most from people who had never 
met Smith but who wanted to salute his heroics. During his six-day 
hospitalization, Smith was in critical condition in the surgical intensive care 
unit and underwent five operations. Nurses described him as a "fighter." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who friends and neighbors said was a happy family man, is survived by 
his wife, Sandra, and their three children: Dominique, 7; Kenny, 3, and 
Danielle, 9 months. Funeral services will be held in Columbus, Ohio, where 
Smith's mother lives, probably at the end of the week, hospital spokesman 
Michael Dabney said. Memorial services have not been planned in San Diego, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers, hospital workers and others close to the family said they were 
overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and concern from the community. The 
family has received more than a thousand letters and cards since Thursday, 
hospital spokeswoman Edie High said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the San Diego Blood Bank, where 501 people donated a pint of 
blood each in Smith's name, said the turnout for Smith was comparable to the 
community response after last fall's San Francisco earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about citizens getting involved. Gary did. That was the type of 
individual that he was," said police Sgt. Willie P. Smith, who was one of the 
officers on the scene after the shooting. "It's unfortunate that he tried to 
come to someone's aid and wound up dying for it." 
</P>
<P>
Flags at all Scripps institutions flew at half-staff Tuesday and were to be at 
half-staff again today, Dabney said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's unprecedented, but we felt it was appropriate. He risked his life and 
ultimately gave his life for what he did," Dabney said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, of the 4000 block of Alabama Street, was laying carpet at a condominium 
in the 7900 block of Camino Tranquilo when he heard screams from the building 
next door. Smith, who worked for a carpet installation firm, chased a 
gun-wielding man about a block down the residential street before he was shot 
in the face, stomach, left arm and right thigh, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors were able to remove two bullets from Smith's body, but Dabney said the 
bullet in his head and abdomen were not removed because doctors considered it 
too risky. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Howard Pemberton, 22, was arrested Friday in connection with the 
shooting and was booked on suspicion of attempted murder and related charges. 
At Pemberton's arraignment Tuesday, the charge was changed to murder. Pemberton 
pleaded not guilty on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said it is considering filing for a finding of 
special circumstances, which would make Pemberton eligible for the death 
penalty if convicted. Bail was set at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Bob Chorny said he was the second officer to arrive at the scene 
of the shooting. "There was lots of blood," he said. "Gary was sitting on the 
steps with multiple gunshot wounds and was in shock. He kept on asking for 
medics and saying he would pass out. I told him to stay with me. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of those things that I'll never forget," Chorny said. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Bekins, 24, a UC San Diego student who lives next door to the 
burglarized family, said he met Smith the day of the shooting as he was walking 
out the door to go to class. Bekins said Smith was working in the balcony 
apartment, and Smith struck up a conversation with him. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing I said to him was, 'Take it easy,' " Bekins said. "I missed the 
action by about a minute and a half." Bekins said that, almost immediately 
after he left, Christiane Chazin, the woman who found the intruder in her home, 
emerged from her apartment screaming. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Price, a pharmacy worker who lives next door to the Smith family, said 
Smith, who had lived in the quiet neighborhood for about seven months, appeared 
to be a family-oriented man. He said he often saw Smith playing with his three 
children or sitting in a lawn chair in his front yard watching his children 
bicycle in the street. 
</P>
<P>
More than $10,000 in donations to defray hospital expenses, estimated to reach 
at least $100,000, have been contributed since Thursday to the Gary Smith fund, 
High said. Several area organizations also pooled blood donations in Smith's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"When San Diegans hear about a need of a particular person, they find a way to 
help," San Diego Blood Bank spokeswoman Lynn Stedd said. She said enough blood 
was donated to replace the blood transfused to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Police Officers Assn. also donated 21 pints of blood from its 
blood bank, usually reserved for injured officers and families of officers, 
said Sgt. Smith, an association board director. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of what Gary had done, it seemed appropriate that since he tried to 
help police officers, we felt it was appropriate for us to help him as much as 
we could," the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
Dabney said Smith's family rode a "roller coaster of emotions" over the past 
few days. He said the family's most optimistic time was after a five-hour 
operation Friday, Smith's last, when doctors stopped internal bleeding. He died 
of lung failure. 
</P>
<P>
Dabney said the family was uninsured but that the hospital's financial 
department will help them receive financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of flowers, the family is asking for contributions to two funds 
established to help offset medical costs and to assist the Smith family. 
Contributions may be sent to the Scripps Memorial Hospital Foundation Gary 
Smith Fund or to Sandra Smith, P.O. Box 28, La Jolla 92038.

COUNTY SUPERVISORS TO PRESS ON WITH BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: HEARINGS WILL START MONDAY BUT THE STATE'S IMPASSE OVER MONEY IS 
EXPECTED TO FORCE THE FRUSTRATED COUNTY BOARD TO REDO MUCH OF ITS OWN WORK 
LATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A frustrated Ventura County Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday to proceed to 
adopt a budget, even though the impasse over money in Sacramento means much of 
the work probably will have to be redone. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel James L. McBride told the board that it would be illegal to 
delay past the Aug. 31 deadline, as board Chairwoman Madge Schaefer had 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Budget hearings will start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the deadlock between Gov. George Deukmejian and the Legislature is 
cleared by Monday, it will be the first time the county has had to prepare its 
own budget before the state, said Chief Administrative Officer Richard 
Wittenberg. Normally the state budget is finished by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way we can do a budget of any importance," Wittenberg said. Much 
of county government, including aid to the poor and disabled, depends on state 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"Our budget is very precariously balanced," said Wittenberg, whose 
$680.7-million preliminary proposal for fiscal 1990-91 will be the starting 
point for the board's deliberations. "We cannot take another hit." 
</P>
<P>
The current proposal, bolstered by higher than expected property tax revenues, 
is 11.1% over the previous fiscal year's $612.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Bohannon, the county manager of legislative affairs, said Wittenberg's 
new budget could be cut by as much as $5 million if Deukmejian can balance the 
state budget without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"That could devastate certain programs," she said. She said she had been told 
by James E. Isom, director of the Public Social Services Agency, that such a 
reduction would seriously affect 30,000 county residents who receive welfare 
payments. She said it would also affect other services to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' mood was downcast. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be doing a budget without any information," Supervisor Susan K. Lacey 
said in joining those calling for a delay. "This could be very confusing to the 
public" because cuts made in September "could wipe out a program." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Maggie H. Erickson added: "I don't want to be in a position of not 
being able to deliver, as the state has done." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' discussion did have a light moment or two, including the 
following exchange: 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer: "Perhaps we could stop the calendar or the clock, the way they do in 
Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
John K. Flynn: "Do you plan to climb the wall and hold the clock's hands back?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, but I could unplug it." 
</P>
<P>
Although some members wanted to delay, they voted unanimously to start the 
process Monday after hearing from McBride. 
</P>
<P>
Wittenberg and other officials sent sharply worded letters to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to share the pain. . . ." he wrote. "Counties cannot and should not 
continue to shoulder the lion's share of budget reductions." 
</P>
<P>
Some welfare recipients announced that they will demonstrate at the County 
Government Center in Ventura on Thursday because they have not received their 
mid-July checks. 
</P>
<P>
The county earlier this month approved a $2.4-million emergency loan to make 
the payments. 
</P>
<P>
Bohannon said she expects next week's hearings to be completed by Thursday. Two 
supervisors, Erickson and James R. Dougherty, make up the board's finance 
subcommittee. The entire board normally sits at the hearings.

JUDGE AWARDS $2 MILLION TO WOMAN BURNED IN '80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old Point Mugu woman has won $2.17 million in damages from the 
federal government, 10 years after an off-duty sailor accidentally doused her 
with burning gasoline while working on a car. 
</P>
<P>
Christa Washington was 10 years old at the time of the accident that left her 
scarred for life, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Roger West, who defended the 
government in a lawsuit filed by Washington's family. 
</P>
<P>
On July 13, U.S. District Court Judge Ronald S.W. Lew awarded Washington 
damages from the U.S. government, which included $2 million for pain and 
suffering, $47,070 for past medical expenses, $25,000 for home nursing care, 
$95,000 for future medical expenses and $10,000 for impairment of future 
earning capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Washington said Tuesday that no amount of money can make up for the 10 years of 
reconstructive surgery, skin grafts and "pure hell" she has been through to 
repair the injuries she suffered. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has no memory of the accident or of her first two weeks in the 
emergency ward. "The first thing I remember was after the accident, being in 
the hospital, fighting for my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 19, 1980, Washington was playing with friends across the street from 
her family's home in military housing at the Pacific Missile Test Center. Two 
Navy enlisted men were trying to start a 1964 Rambler in a garage, in front of 
which the children were playing. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bartole was pouring gasoline from a coffee can into the car's open 
carburetor to prime it while Neil Cleaves turned the key to crank the balky 
engine, said Washington's attorney, John Zanghi. 
</P>
<P>
The carburetor backfired, igniting the gasoline and startling Bartole, who 
spilled some of it on his arm and ran out of the garage, Zanghi said. Bartole 
later testified that he tripped over a stool or a bucket, spraying the flaming 
gasoline onto Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bartole and Cleaves immediately smothered the fire with a blanket, but 
Washington had already suffered burns on her head, neck, shoulder, arm and leg. 
Bartole suffered burns to his arms. 
</P>
<P>
Washington said that since the accident, she has undergone more than 20 
sessions of reconstructive surgery and skin grafts under general anesthesia, 
and countless more under local anesthesia. Her destroyed right ear was rebuilt 
from tissue grafts taken from the unburned part of her body, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Zanghi said she may also have to have an artificial joint implanted in her 
burned thumb, which may suffer from arthritis in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"She would have been a beautiful woman, there's no doubt about it, but she's 
still badly scarred," Zanghi said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Washington said doctors allowed her to go home after about two months because 
her mother was once a nurse in a hospital burn unit in South Carolina and could 
change her dressings and handle much of her care at home. 
</P>
<P>
Washington said school officials wanted to keep her back in the fifth grade. 
"But I refused to be held back. With tutors and a lot of hard work I was able 
to keep up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's mother, Barbara Washington, sued Cleaves, Bartole and the federal 
government, but Zanghi said he later dropped the men from the suit because they 
had little money that could be taken for damages. 
</P>
<P>
The case finally went to a non-jury trial in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles, where Judge Lew ruled in the government's favor and against Washington 
in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But Zanghi appealed the case to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which 
late last year reversed the lower court decision to Washington's favor and 
returned the case to Lew to determine damages. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, who still lives with her parents, said she sees Bartole often in 
her neighborhood. "Being a Christian, I have to learn to forgive or forget, but 
there's a certain something in me that can't forgive or forget . . . . I can 
say, 'Hi,' but every time I see him, I think, 'This is the person that 
disfigured me for life.' "

EX-OWNER JOUSTS WITH CITY OVER MOTEL; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: BERTHA OCHOA CALLS THE LEMON TREE ONE OF THE CITY'S LAST SOURCES OF 
LOW-INCOME HOUSING, BUT POLICE CALL IT A CENTER OF DRUG ACTIVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Oxnard's effort to eliminate what police describe as the center of drug 
activity in the downtown area has met with a small snag: Bertha Ochoa. 
</P>
<P>
The former owner of the Lemon Tree Motel was arrested Monday for defying a 
court order that bans her from entering the 25-year-old motel, which the city 
has acquired under eminent domain proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa was released by police on her own recognizance and returned to the motel 
to spend the night with her daughter. On Tuesday city officials and police 
ordered Ochoa to leave, saying she had been inciting tenants against the city. 
Threatened with a second arrest, Ochoa left the motel voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
City officials call it a small victory in their effort to eliminate a 
continuing source of headaches. Police consider the Lemon Tree Motel a source 
of drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
But Ochoa said she will not give up. She said that her arrest on Monday 
violated her civil rights and vowed to appeal the city's eminent domain 
decision to a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa said she has lived in the motel for years but has been forced to leave 
without the same 90-day eviction notice sent by the city to other tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not in Russia or Cuba. They cannot treat us this way," Ochoa said as 
two Oxnard police officers looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Kuetzing, a lawyer representing the city of Oxnard, said Ochoa was warned 
last week that if she did not leave the motel by Monday she would be arrested. 
Ochoa was never a tenant and the city acted within the law by arresting her, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuetzing, a specialist in eminent domain law, said a private building manager 
hired by the city to operate the motel decided Tuesday that Ochoa was 
interfering in the operation of the building. Police were told to arrest Ochoa 
if she tries to enter the building. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa was arrested Monday on suspicion of entering a building after being 
banned from the site by court order, a misdemeanor violation, police said. She 
was released on her own recognizance later that day, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa and the city's Redevelopment Department have been engaged for several 
months in a bitter dispute over the motel. The city contends that the motel is 
the center of drug deals and prostitution and plans to demolish the aging 
building to make way for a parking lot as part of a large downtown 
redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Stan Myers said police consider the Lemon Tree Motel the center of drug 
activity in downtown Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that the motel is a center for criminal activity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they made seven arrests at the motel on Monday night. Most of the 
arrests were drug-related, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa denied that the tenants are involved in criminal activity and said city 
officials have been engaged in a "political conspiracy" to demolish the motel. 
She said the motel is one of the city's last sources of low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa and several tenants said if the building is demolished many tenants will 
be homeless. The city is required by law to find affordable housing for each 
tenant before the motel is demolished. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Ochoa filed for bankruptcy in an effort to delay the city 
from taking possession of the motel. But in June a bankruptcy judge lifted the 
stay and ruled that the city could take possession of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Ventura County Superior Court judge approved a request by the city 
that allowed the city to remove and ban Ochoa from the building, Kuetzing said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have offered Ochoa $795,000 for the building but Ochoa has said 
the amount is too low and has vowed to appeal the price in court. Kuetzing said 
the matter may ultimately be decided by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city has hired Myers and Associates, a private management firm, 
to run the motel until the city relocates all the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The city's redevelopment department has also ordered four Oxnard police 
officers to patrol the motel to prevent any violence, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa, however, said the officers, who have been stationed at the motel since 
Monday afternoon, have been harassing the tenants. Arturo Munoz, 30, said he 
was arrested Monday for drinking a beer in his room. 
</P>
<P>
Myers said he was not sure what arrests have been made at the motel, but he 
denied that tenants had been harassed. 
</P>
<P>
Kuetzing said the city has the right to have police protect city property. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is the landlord and as landlord the city has the same right as any 
other landlord," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ochoa responded: "The police shouldn't be involved in a civil matter. They 
should be chasing criminals."

QUESTIONS RAISED BY OIL-RECYCLING PLANT CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nelco Oil Refining Corp. ducked a blow from state officials that would have 
shut the doors on the National City oil recycling plant, by closing shop and 
filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The company's move into bankruptcy last week has raised a slew of questions for 
state officials about where the money will come from to pay for a final 
inspection and any cleanup of contaminated soil, equipment or materials that 
might be at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the State Department of Health Services Toxic Substances Control 
Program were in the process of denying Nelco an operating permit when the 
company filed for bankruptcy. One reason cited for the denial was the company's 
failure to obtain liability coverage and financial assurance that, in the event 
of an accident or plant closure, would provide the money for a cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
A quick look around the plant Monday by a county hazardous-materials team found 
no immediate health risk to the community or environment, officials said. The 
plant is near the Civic Center Drive exit off Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old company, which stopped operations July 13, had been operating 
under an interim permit since 1985, state officials said. The bankruptcy lawyer 
handling the Nelco case said it was the high cost of state-required insurance 
that forced the company to seek protection from its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't afford to pay for it. They just couldn't economically continue 
operation, because of the expense of the insurance," attorney Dennis Burns 
said. "It didn't make sense to keep going. Why beat a dead horse?" 
</P>
<P>
Nelco, co-owned by brothers Roger and Steven Humphreys, claimed just more than 
$197,000 in assets in its bankruptcy filing, while the corporation's total debt 
is estimated at $700,000, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Chapter 7 liquidation, the court will appoint a trustee who will take 
over the corporation's assets, sell them and then distribute the money among 
creditors, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, it's kind of like we give up; take us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelco has a checkered past of compliance with hazardous-waste laws, according 
to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
The company was cited in December for 17 alleged violations, including material 
spilling out of hazardous-waste containers and using an oil treatment method 
not allowed under the guidelines of their interim operating permit, said Allan 
Hirsch, spokesman for the state toxics program. 
</P>
<P>
These latest citations and previous ones that included illegally storing 1,500 
barrels of acid sludge waste near I-5 in the early 1980s contributed to the 
state's decision to deny Nelco the operating permit, Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Avera, assistant deputy director of environmental health services for the 
county, said there are still about 200 55-gallon drums stacked three high on 
pallets at the plant, some of them bearing contaminated-soil labels. Because of 
the way the drums are stacked, he said, inspectors cannot tell exactly how many 
have the labels. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors also noticed about 10 above-ground tanks that can hold 5,000 to 
10,000 gallons of material. Avera said the next step is to find out if there is 
anything in the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to see what was really going on and to see whether there were any 
obvious problems," he said. "There were no obvious problems as of yesterday."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;

<P>
COUNCIL OKS CURBSIDE PLAN FOR RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ojai City Council voted Tuesday to begin weekly curbside recycling service 
to households throughout the city this fall. 
</P>
<P>
At its Tuesday night meeting, the council also decided to allow trash hauler 
E.J. Harrison to raise household collection rates by 15% to meet inflationary 
costs and help develop a recycling plan to reduce the volume of trash Ojai 
residents send to the dump. 
</P>
<P>
The typical monthly rate will increase from $14.40 to $17.67 per household. 
Commercial rates, which vary according to such factors as bin size, will go up 
about 17%, said James Harrison, company vice president. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage recycling, the council also established a lower monthly trash bill 
of $14.70 for those residents who keep the volume of garbage to less than 32 
gallons a week. Harrison plans to offer his 1,800 residential customers either 
a 32-gallon plastic trash barrel or a 101-gallon barrel to replace the 
55-gallon steel drums now used as trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who recycle waste items may find that they don't need to pay the 
higher collection rates, Harrison said. No fee or deposit will be required for 
the new barrels, Harrison said. He expects to begin delivery in October. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Ojai will really participate," Harrison said. "They're really 
environmentally conscious up there." 
</P>
<P>
The council awarded Harrison the recycling contract, despite objections from 
his biggest competitor, Ojai Rubbish, at Tuesday night's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling program will be modeled after the ones Harrison has under way in 
Ventura and Fillmore. Ojai residents who choose to participate will receive a 
free 35-to-45-gallon barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said he is ready to begin a pilot recycling program as soon as the 
city irons out contract details. "There's tremendous interest in the program. 
To me it's fun to offer a service people are so excited about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All recyclable articles such as aluminum cans, glass and plastic bottles, 
plastic bags and cardboard will be placed in the barrel with newspapers on top. 
The barrels will be trucked to Ventura's recycling center where the materials 
will be separated. 
</P>
<P>
Alasdair Coyne, president of the Recycling and Environmental Action Program 
that has operated a monthly curbside collection service in the Ojai Valley for 
12 years, said he is relieved that Harrison has offered to service Ojai because 
REAP does not have the capability to pick up all of the recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel he has a system that will work very well," Coyne said. "REAP will 
continue pickup in the unincorporated areas." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison also noted that his company has already taken over REAP's commercial 
accounts for collecting white paper from offices. The company has held a 
garbage collection franchise with the city since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said the rate hike is needed to cover inflation, higher landfill scale 
fees, a franchise fee the city will collect from Harrison, and costs to develop 
a plan to reduce commercial and residential waste by 25% over the next five 
years as mandated by a new state law. THIA BELL

LACEY SEEKS BROADER HUNT FOR DUMP SITE

<P>
Ventura County should widen its search for a landfill site to include the 
central county and the Santa Clara River Valley, Supervisor Susan Lacey said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The county is studying the potential effects on the environment of only two 
sites, both north of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Those two sites, Weldon Canyon and Hammond Canyon, are both just east of 
Highway 33 off Canada Larga Road. 
</P>
<P>
But area environmentalists and the city of Ojai, which is north of the two 
sites, strongly oppose the use of either canyon as a landfill. Lacey, whose 
district includes western Ventura County, said the county should open its 
search to new areas.

"I think we need as many options out there as we can possibly have," Lacey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1985 Solid Waste Management Plan divided the county into three 
so-called "waste sheds," the county has limited its options to the "western 
waste shed." That area includes areas surrounding the cities of Ojai, Ventura, 
Port Hueneme and Oxnard, which would use the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 plan chose Weldon Canyon north of Ventura as the preferred site, with 
neighboring Hammond Canyon as the second choice. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Maggie Erickson, who represents the Santa Clara River Valley and 
areas surrounding the cities of Fillmore and Santa Paula, said she would oppose 
sending trash from the west out to the central county. 
</P>
<P>
"They have already provided for themselves out there with the Toland Road 
Landfill," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Laughlin, a supervisor in the county Planning Division, said it could 
cost too much to haul trash farther east than Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
But Russ Baggerly, a member of the board of the Environmental Coalition, said 
air pollution problems could be reduced by shipping trash by train along the 
Southern Pacific Railroad line between Ventura and Fillmore. JOANNA M. MILLER

NEPOTISM RULES NOT BROKEN, BOARD SAYS 
</P>

<P>
The County Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday that Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury did not violate anti-nepotism rules by allowing the head of his 
child-support division to keep his new wife on his staff. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors approved a report by the county Personnel Department saying the 
Civil Service Commission "concluded inaccurately" that C. Stanley Trom, the 
child-support unit's manager, had hiring and firing authority over his wife, 
Margaret Trom, an ombudsman in the division. 
</P>
<P>
That power, called "appointing authority," actually was held by Bradbury, 
Personnel Director Ronald W. Komers said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Komers told the board that on Nov. 15, Margaret Trom's position 
was placed under the authority of Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White, 
removing Trom from her husband's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The Troms, both longtime county employees, married Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"With the change in reporting relationship, there is no direct or indirect 
supervision of the ombudsman function by an immediate family member," Komers 
said. JACK SEARLES

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL TO CONSIDER ADDING EXTRA OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Moorpark City Council is gearing for a debate tonight over whether to beef 
up surveillance of youth gangs by hiring an extra sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
About $82,500 has been reserved in Moorpark's nearly $2-million law enforcement 
budget. However, council members are divided over how to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has maintained that Moorpark has a low crime rate and 
no gang problem. However, concerns about an increase in vandalism and burglary 
earlier this year prompted a suggestion from two council members that the city 
add an officer to the Sheriff's Department special enforcement detail. 
</P>
<P>
The officer's main task would be gang and drug enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Paul Lawrason said Tuesday that he is in favor of adding an officer 
because citizens are aggravated by the vandals who paint graffiti in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Until vandals began spraying graffiti on their property, residents in newer 
housing tracts in the southern hillsides of Moorpark did not believe that crime 
was on the increase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Bernardo Perez said he believes that adding an officer to 
concentrate on gangs when there are no known gangs in the city is a poor use of 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
Perez has asked for additional funds for youth activities, rather than 
stepped-up police enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no support for the special enforcement detail at this time," Perez 
said. "Things would have to change drastically for me to consider supporting 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark Sheriff's Lt. Rich Rodriguez in a report to the council said officials 
have three options. 
</P>
<P>
The first option would be to hire a full-time officer for the special 
enforcement team based in Thousand Oaks. The officer would bolster Moorpark's 
15-officer patrol. The special enforcement team covers most of eastern Ventura 
County, and adding an officer to the team would ensure that Moorpark is 
assigned a full-time deputy, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
The two other options would be to hire a community services officer to oversee 
crime prevention and neighborhood watch programs, or to hire a youth resources 
officer to handle anti-drug programs in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
All three options would cost the same, Rodriguez said.

SANTA PAULA SCHOOL BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Paula Elementary School district has proposed a $515,000 budget cut 
for fiscal year 1990-1991. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these cuts would include the following: cutting in half library 
services for kindergarten through fifth grade, more teacher layoffs, freeze 
teachers' salaries, cut various supplies and other things which the public is 
not aware of at this time. 
</P>
<P>
A $515,000 budget cut in our elementary schools is a very serious issue. Its 
finances obviously are in a poor state. 
</P>
<P>
School budget cuts that affect our children's education are a grave matter. On 
the one hand, the school board members and superintendents give many reasons 
for cutting the budget. On the other hand, school board members approve a 25% 
salary increase for our assistant superintendent and a bonus to our 
superintendent. It appears that there is accessible money for what the 
superintendents and school board members want, but none available for the needs 
of our teachers and their students. 
</P>
<P>
News was released June 28 that the value of property in Ventura County 
increased last year and will yield about $13 million more in tax revenue than 
was expected. A percentage of this revenue will go to our school district. I 
wonder how our school district will allocate these new funds.

FIREFIGHTERS TO GIVE VICTIMS TEDDY BEARS

<P>
The Ventura Fire Department next month will begin stocking its engines with an 
unusual piece of equipment -- teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
City firefighters will hand out the 11-inch-tall stuffed animals to help soothe 
children who are victims of accidents or fires, spokesman Barry Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will give them some instant gratification and maybe help ease the pain," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The brown-and-white teddy bears, known as Buffy Bears, are donated by the 
Assistance League of Ventura County, a community service organization that 
helps children, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
The cuddly toys are handed out by Ventura and Oxnard police, the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office, Assistance League 
spokeswoman Peggy Purnell said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 of the teddy bears have been given out since the program began 
last year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It really seems to fill a need children have to cuddle something," Purnell 
said. CAROLYN KUSKY

PARTY-CONTROL LAW TENTATIVELY OKD 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council has tentatively approved an ordinance that will 
require those who throw loud and raucous parties to reimburse the city for the 
cost of dispatching police responding to neighborhood complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said that during the past year officers answered 845 calls 
about party disturbances throughout the city, compared to 799 the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beginning to be outrageous," Councilman Glen McAdoo said of the number of 
disturbance calls generated each year. "The neighborhoods are not designed to 
have nightclubs in the middle of them, and that's exactly what's happened." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Bob Gardner, who helped write the ordinance, said police will first issue 
a written warning to those responsible for a disturbance complaint. Gardner 
said those individuals will then be billed for any additional calls the police 
have to make. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cost of police responses will vary, Gardner said, the least that 
loud revelers can expect to pay is $250. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner said he has talked to officials of several cities in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties that have enacted similar laws, and they said the laws were 
successful in reducing party disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to give final approval to the party ordinance at its 
meeting next Monday. The ordinance will take effect 30 days later. CARLOS V.

PORT DISTRICT PLEDGES TO PAY CITIES $7 MILLION FOR SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The member cities of the San Diego Unified Port District received a pledge of 
$7 million from port commissioners Tuesday, in exchange for police and fire 
protection and a range of other services provided on port property. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which is subject to review by the state attorney general, is 
designed to alleviate the fiscal burden of the port's member cities by paying 
for various services. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cities have provided such services for years, the agreement, if 
approved, would pertain only to the fiscal year that began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when many of the cities are facing budget deficits -- San Diego's, 
for instance, is more than $60 million -- the Port District's annual revenues 
now exceed expenses by about $40 million. In addition to San Diego, the money 
would go to National City, Coronado, Imperial Beach and Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, port commissioners heard arguments from San Diego County 
Postmaster Margaret Sellers and the leaseholders of a restaurant site near 
Lindbergh Field about converting the 20,000-square-foot building to an air mail 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
The port referred the matter to an ad hoc airport committee, which was asked to 
consider as separate issues Sellers' request for the air mail facility and the 
future of the former Copacabana restaurant site. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back to the issue of competing needs at Lindbergh Field," said Dan 
Wilkins, a spokesman for the district. "We have only a few acres and many 
groups with many needs. What the board said was, let's put (the 
restaurant-site) issue in a larger framework and have the committee review and 
respond." 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said San Diego County's current air mail facility, at 960 square feet, 
is the smallest among the nation's 10 largest cities. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Peck, a real estate specialist for the U.S. Postal Service, said the 
Copacabana site is perfect, since any new facility must have access to the 
Lindbergh runway. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate developer Gregg Newman, who sold the lease to former San Diego 
Padres' President Ballard Smith, said Smith has lost $15,000 a month on the 
property since being forced to close the restaurant in December when the 
windows were blown out by a jet on takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said the lease costs $3,850 a month, but Smith's expenses also include 
loan payments and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"My gut feeling is that they don't want to put the Postal Service in there," 
Newman said. "They don't want to tie up the property with another long-term 
lease. But I already have a lease, which doesn't expire for another 17 years. 
If Ballard and I wanted to, we could open another restaurant there tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Historic preservationists spoke against the postal facility, saying it would 
require too much remodeling of the building.

MEASURE ON SALES OF SHELTER ANIMALS REWORDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to reword the 
language in a proposed ballot measure on whether the county should continue 
selling impounded animals for medical research. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory measure, as proposed by 5th District Supervisor John MacDonald, 
would ask whether the county should continue to provide animals for medical 
research to seek cures for heart disease, lung disease, diabetes and other 
human ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Animal rights advocates criticized the wording of the measure as biased in 
favor of UC San Diego, the only facility with a contract to purchase impounded 
dogs and cats from the county Department of Animal Control. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue is not medical research but pound seizure (shelters selling 
animals) and the county's contract with UCSD," said Sally Mackler of San Diego 
Animal Advocates. "The wording is misleading and loaded." 
</P>
<P>
The advocates, who said they learned of the proposal Friday, also blasted the 
board for "ramming" the measure forward without providing enough time for 
public input. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 4 to 1 to have county counsel reword the measure for its 
meeting next Tuesday, when supervisors will decide whether to put it on the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The county has three animal shelters. Only the North County facility does not 
sell impounded animals to UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD pays the county $58 for each dog and $30 for each cat. In the past fiscal 
year, UCSD purchased 325 animals from the county. The animal control department 
destroyed 26,000 animals, 10,000 of which were brought in by their owners, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mackler said selling impounded animals for use in medical research violates the 
goal of animal shelters: to provide humane care for pets until they are claimed 
by their owners or adopted or put to death without pain. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Attiyeh, dean of graduate studies and research at UCSD, said the 
university treats the impounded animals responsibly and humanely. Attiyeh 
opposed placing the measure before voters, but said the university is confident 
the public would approve of using impounded animals for medical research. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald and 1st District Supervisor Brian Bilbray also defended the practice, 
saying the animals contribute to advances in medical research and that it makes 
no sense to raise animals specifically for research while plenty are available 
in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
The animal rights advocates also said spending an estimated $50,000 to put the 
advisory measure before voters would be a waste of money and would be better 
spent on establishing a county-operated program for spaying and neutering pets. 
The animal control department refers pet owners to veterinarians, but does not 
provide spaying and neutering services.

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When one of his horses won a race at Hollywood Park last weekend, trainer Doug 
Peterson said: "That's shipping money for Del Mar." 
</P>
<P>
The same day, in the paddock, Kent Desormeaux, the Eclipse Award-winning 
jockey, was talking about Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the town, but never been to the track," said Desormeaux, who came to 
California from Maryland early this year after winning a record 598 races in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux was here a few weeks ago, shopping for a condominium rental. Someone 
suggested a $16,000 deal for the seven-week season, but Desormeaux was able to 
find something slightly closer to budget, and not far from the track, either. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Peterson starts trying to pay for his horses' travel, and Desormeaux for 
the digs of his family, when Del Mar, the seven-week breath of ocean air 
between Hollywood Park and Santa Anita on the Southland's major racing 
schedule, begins its 51st season. 
</P>
<P>
There's almost enough money to go around at this seaside track, where business 
went from brisk to bustling two years ago with the introduction of off-track 
betting. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar was on the verge of becoming too much of a good thing, a turf by the 
surf that couldn't accommodate one more bettor without attracting the fire 
marshal, when the state opened up betting on its races at Santa Anita, 
Hollywood Park and points as far north as Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the daily handle, off-track and on, grew to $7.3 million, which 
put Del Mar in the same betting league as Santa Anita, the national record- 
holder. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the off-track network has grown from 11 to 13 locations. The new 
sites are the Cabazon Indian Bingo Palace and Gaming Center in Indio, and Los 
Alamitos, which will segue into the Del Mar races after the Orange County Fair 
season ends Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of all this action, Del Mar is offering about $14 million in 
purses, nearly $4 million of it in a 28-race stakes program. There are nine 
races six days a week, Wednesday through Monday, with the season running 
through Sept. 12. First post is at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, Criminal Type and Steinlen have gone East, but there are enough 
horses on the grounds to give the Del Mar stakes some glitter. Prized, 
Hawkster, Saratoga Passage, Brown Bess and Petite Ile are expected to run here, 
as well as the Southland's best 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
The $300,000 races are the Del Mar Derby Aug. 19, the Cabrillo Handicap Aug. 
25, the Del Mar Debutante Sept. 2, the Del Mar Handicap Sept. 3 and the Del Mar 
Futurity Sept. 12. Also on the schedule are the $250,000 Eddie Read Handicap 
Aug. 12 and the $250,000 Ramona Handicap Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Today's split Oceanside Stakes, at a mile on grass, will have 11 3-year-olds in 
one division and 12 in the other, an early test of the mettle of handicappers. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally, who won a division of the Oceanside last year with 
Hawkster, has an outside chance to sweep the stake today through sheer numbers. 
He will have Officer Hawk and Old Alliance in the first half and Single Dawn 
and Balla Cove in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Hawk, a son of Silver Hawk, who also sired Hawkster, is trying to make 
the jump into stakes company, and Old Alliance has won one of three starts 
after spending his 2-year-old season in Europe. Single Dawn hasn't won since 
November, when he took the Hoist the Flag at a mile on the grass at Hollywood 
Park. Balla Cove hasn't won in fives race dating to January. 
</P>
<P>
In the first division, Mehmetori, with only one victory in eight starts, comes 
in off a good second to Jovial in the Cinema Handicap at Hollywood. Jovial came 
off grass to win the Swaps Sunday. In the second half, Bel Air Paster also has 
a recent second behind Jovial. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The meeting's defending champions are jockey Eddie Delahoussaye and trainer Ron 
McAnally. . . . Only 26% of the favorites won at Del Mar last year, several 
points below the national average and the lowest percentage at the track since 
1955. . . . This is the seventh time the Oceanside Stakes has been split in the 
last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Blossom is expected to run Sunday in the six-furlong Bing Crosby 
Handicap, then head to Pimlico for the Frank De Francis Memorial Dash Aug. 18. 
. . . The other weekend stake will be Saturday's Palomar Handicap, for fillies 
and mares going 1 1/16 miles on grass. Bayakoa has been nominated. 
</P>
<P>
A $2 exacta will be offered on all nine races. . . . Vann Belvoir, 16, one of 
the leading riders at Longacres, near Seattle, is an apprentice who will ride 
at Del Mar. . . . At Monmouth Park today, Julie Krone will ride for the first 
time since she suffered a broken left forearm in a spill last November. . . . 
Pat Day will ride Steinlen in the Arlington Challenge Cup on Aug. 4. Jose 
Santos, who usually rides the horse, will be serving a five-day suspension that 
week. . . . Michael Wrona, the Hollywood Park announcer, will be calling the 
races for the next week at Arlington. Trevor Denman, who calls the races at Del 
Mar and Santa Anita, did the announcing for the past week at Arlington. Denman 
and Wrona have been replacing Phil Georgeff, who has a sore throat.

SOCKERS TO NOW FOCUS ON SIGNING PLAYERS, LURING FANS TO 'MSL'

<P>
The Major Indoor Soccer League on Tuesday said at league meetings in Baltimore 
that it will be phasing the "Indoor" from its title as a precursor to an 
agreement with the U.S. Soccer Federation. 
</P>
<P>
That agreement is likely to lead to a limited outdoor schedule by MISL teams, 
satisfying the requirements of FIFA, soccer's world governing body, that the 
United States field a professional outdoor league before it plays host to the 
1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
But with all that going on, the Sockers' interest remains mostly on indoor play 
and how they will go about charting a course for a ninth title in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's press conference to announce that the league will go forward with 
eight teams, Socker owner Ron Fowler said plans for his team had been on hold 
the past month while the league concentrated efforts on keeping alive the St. 
Louis franchise. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Sockers have yet to: 1) begin a season-ticket sales push; 2) 
fill two vacant front-office positions, director of sales and vice-president of 
marketing, and 3) work out radio and television deals. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yeah, they need to sign some players. As of now, only forward Branko Segota 
is under contract for next season. 
</P>
<P>
With a new collective bargaining agreement ratified by owners at Tuesday's 
league meetings in Baltimore, almost all league players become free agents. 
That's because the new agreement reduces the salary cap by $140,000 to $630,000 
per team. Players insisted they be allowed to negotiate league-wide. 
</P>
<P>
(Segota has one more year left on a guaranteed contract that keeps him from 
having to go the free-agent route. He will earn $102,000, $30,000 above the new 
maximum of $72,000.) 
</P>
<P>
Fowler and Coach Ron Newman said they should be able to retain the nucleus that 
helped the Sockers in June claim their eighth title in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously a lot of other teams are taking shots at (our players)," Fowler 
said. "But I would expect that 10 of our top 12 players will be back for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Still, gathering that many signatures won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think trouble is going to come from every different direction," Newman said. 
"These guys won another championship, and I think their value increased 
throughout the league, and each one naturally expects that if there is going to 
be a special case, that they are going to be that special case. But the trouble 
is, there's 18 of them, and we can't justify increasing all their salaries 
across the board." 
</P>
<P>
Some, however, will have to be increased: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Midfielder Wes Wade last year was on a six-month developmental contract 
that paid him just $1,000 per month. This year, he must be signed to a 
professional contract that calls for higher minimums: $2,000 per month for 
first-year players, $2,250 for second-year players and $2,500 for third-year 
players. It is not known whether Wade will be considered a first- or 
second-year player, but it may not matter. Because he became a main contributor 
to the team, he will likely get more than the minimum of $2,500 for a 
second-year player. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Forward Rod Castro made $22,500 in his first indoor season. It was 
announced Tuesday that he had finished third in newcomer-of-the-year voting 
(with 18 votes) to Claudio De Oliveira of St. Louis (42) and Ron Fearon of 
Baltimore (30). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Paul Wright came back to the Sockers midway through the season in a trade 
with Cleveland and was credited with jump-starting an idle season and getting 
the team into the playoffs. He made $25,000 last year and made it known after 
the season he wouldn't mind going back to Cleveland if that's where the money 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 -- George Fernandez earned $30,000 during a year in which he came into his 
own, being named most valuable player at the All-Star game and most valuable 
defender for the Sockers. He is expected to get a raise. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran defender Kevin Crow, who made $60,000 last year, said Monday he will 
take a pay cut. Others who may be in line for reductions include goalkeeper 
Zoltan Toth ($68,000 last year), midfielder Brian Quinn ($60,000), midfielder 
Waad Hirmez ($54,000) and forward Damir Haramina ($45,000). 
</P>
<P>
Players are not the only unsigned talent the Sockers must worry about. Fowler 
said "it was too late a month ago" to hire a new director of sales and a 
vice-president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
He said both positions likely will be filled within seven days. The preferred 
candidates are now employed, and Fowler said he didn't want to hire them until 
he was sure the league was going to be around. 
</P>
<P>
Season-ticket sales also must be addressed. Last year, there were 3,200 sold. 
The goal this year is 3,500. But Fowler said, "To be honest with you, I would 
actually like to see 4,000." 
</P>
<P>
He later added, "With the league stability and a stronger, more dynamic sales 
force, we expect to do better with corporate sales than we have in the past. 
I'm hoping the majority of the increase will come from corporations." 
</P>
<P>
He and president Ron Cady are also talking to a number of radio stations and 
two TV stations about carrying Socker games. He would not identify them. 
</P>
<P>
MISL Notes 
</P>
<P>
The name change to Major Soccer League will be done gradually as lawyers are 
consulted over copyright, trademark and licensing questions. . . . The league 
also filled a post that had been vacant for five years. Ellen Erhman will be 
the new director of marketing. . . . The regular season has been reduced from 
56 games to 52, with the opener scheduled for Oct. 19. The season ends April 
17. The playoff format remains the same, with one minor adjustment. The first 
round will be a three-game series rather than five games. . . . The league also 
announced a three-year deal with Bike Athletics that calls for that company to 
supply all uniforms and practice supplies. . . . Socker Donald Cogsville 
finished third in rookie of the year voting with 16 votes. Terry Brown of St. 
Louis was the overwhelming choice with 78 votes, and Angelo Panzetta of 
Baltimore received 17 votes.

CONCERTS BY 2 LIVE CREW, BASIA, SOUL II SOUL CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Next Sunday's scheduled appearance by 2 Live Crew at Iguana's in Tijuana has 
been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
No, it's not because the promoter suddenly got cold feet about booking the 
controversial rappers, who have become something of a scapegoat for Moral 
Majority angst ever since a federal judge in Florida on June 6 declared their 
most recent album obscene. 
</P>
<P>
The group's leader, Luther Campbell (a.k.a. Luke Skyywalker), is ill, forcing 
the cancellation of 2 Live Crew's entire West Coast tour. 
</P>
<P>
Two other highly publicized local pop shows were also canceled last week. 
</P>
<P>
The second of Basia's two sold-out concerts at the Civic Theatre downtown was 
canceled at the last minute when her celebrated pipes failed. When the pop 
singer arrived in town Thursday afternoon, promoter Bill Silva said, "she 
already wasn't feeling well, but that night's show went off without a hitch." 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's show didn't. Ottmar Liebert had just finished his opening set 
when Silva was told by Basia's stage manager that the singer's condition had 
suddenly worsened and she wouldn't be able to perform. 
</P>
<P>
"She was trying to do her vocal warm-ups and couldn't get any sound at all," 
Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
The concert has been rescheduled for Nov. 16. Refunds are available at the site 
of purchase; tickets may also be exchanged for the same seat on the new date. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, earlier Friday, the folks at Avalon Attractions decided to call off 
Soul II Soul's Sunday night appearance at San Diego State University's Open Air 
Theatre because of poor ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
"There was definitely a great lack of support by San Diegans," said Avalon's 
David Swift. "I wish I knew why; I guess if we knew why it didn't work, we 
wouldn't have booked it in the first place. It's just one of those things that 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, the Soul II Soul concert will not be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Noted Los Angeles record producer Michael Lloyd was in San Diego last Thursday 
for a series of meetings with Children's Hospital and Health Center executives 
about the upcoming benefit album of Christmas tunes by big-name pop stars he 
has volunteered to produce. 
</P>
<P>
The press was invited, and, although Lloyd had previously said he wouldn't 
announce contributors until October, speculation that the project might be in 
trouble prompted him to break the news a little early. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Lloyd said, he has firm commitments from eight of the 20 acts he's 
hoping to include on "The Christmas Album . . . A Gift of Love." Among them are 
Fleetwood Mac ("The First Noel"), Barry Manilow ("Ave Maria") and Fifth 
Dimension alumnus Marilyn McCoo (a new song, "Every Day Is Christmas"). 
America, Belinda Carlisle, Wayne Newton, Andy Williams and Christian 
heavy-metal band Stryper have also agreed to contribute a song each, either a 
traditional Christmas carol or a newly penned original. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the summer and early fall, Lloyd said, he'll take these eight acts 
-- and at least four more -- into the studio to record their respective 
contributions. The remaining cuts on the album will be previously released 
Christmas tunes other pop heavyweights have put out in the past. The more 
obscure the better, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"The list I have available is endless," he said. "I'm looking at several 
different versions of 'Winter Wonderland,' 'The Christmas Song' and 'Little 
Drummer Boy,' trying to find the ones that have long been out of print, that 
you rarely, if ever, hear on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, that same day, expatriate San Diego singer- songwriter Stephen 
Bishop was at The Studio in Kearny Mesa, recording his version of "The 
Christmas Song" for another upcoming benefit album of Christmas tunes by 
big-name pop stars, "The Stars Come Out for Christmas 1990." Helping out on the 
sessions was Little River Band bassist-singer, and fellow local, Wayne Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's inaugural "Stars" album raised more than $160,000 for Children's 
Hospital. Producer Steve Vaus was subsequently asked to do a second benefit 
Christmas album for the hospital, but when he requested a production fee, he 
was given the boot in favor of Lloyd, who offered to donate his services. 
</P>
<P>
Vaus decided to do a follow-up anyway. He selected a new beneficiary, the local 
chapter of the American Cancer Society, and promptly began working on "The 
Stars Come Out for Christmas 1990," which, unlike Lloyd's project, is already 
nearing completion. 
</P>
<P>
The album's big-name contributors, aside from Bishop, include the Commodores, 
Ray Charles, Johnny Cash, Randy Travis, Don McLean, Barbara Mandrell, Kim 
Carnes and Kenny Rankin. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Five local bands will be doing their bit for the homeless at 
Sunday's "Rockin' for Comic Relief" benefit concert at the Time Machine in 
Escondido. Proceeds go to the San Diego Health Care for the Homeless Program. 
Appearing will be Dr. Feelgood and the Interns of Love, Roughneck Posse, 
Nemesis, the Barking Spyders and Shondra and the Source. The music starts at 5 
p.m.; tickets are $10 and are available at the Time Machine, the Logan Heights 
Family Health Center in Barrio Logan and Dimension Cable outlets in Escondido, 
Vista and Oceanside. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The ad in last Thursday's Reader for Depeche Mode's third show (July 31) at the 
San Diego Sports Arena proudly announces, "Making History in San Diego. 
Unprecedented 3 Night Stand!" Promoter Bill Silva must have a short memory: 
Just three years ago, Neil Diamond also made an "unprecedented" three-night 
stand at the arena -- only then, it really was. . . . 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen local rock 'n' roll and heavy-metal bands will perform at 
this weekend's "Summer Jam '90," a two- night music festival at the La Paloma 
Theater in Encinitas. Appearing Friday night will be Cyclone Sound, Dirty 
Blonde, Wildside, X-Factor, Secret Society, Rampage, Gun Shy and Mae Dae. On 
tap for Saturday night: Young Gunns, Bad Blood, Hung Jury, Toxic Bunnies, 
Pystol Whip, Morley Grey and Snake Eyes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Mathis, who was in town last Monday and Tuesday for a two-night stand at 
Humphrey's on Shelter Island, was so impressed with his hotel-suite dressing 
room that he spent the night there -- while a considerably more posh suite that 
had already been reserved for him sat empty. "He especially liked the kitchen, 
where he prepared all his meals after stocking up on groceries at the local 
Von's," said promoter Kenny Weissberg. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. for Public Enemy's Aug. 26 concert at the 
San Diego Sports Arena. Also on the bill: Heavy D and the Boyz, Digital 
Underground and Kid 'n' Play. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: "World Beat Tour '90," featuring Jimmy 
Cliff, Fela Anikulapo Kuti and Egypt 80 with Imo and Lucky Dube, Thursday at 
the Open Air Theatre at SDSU; Stan Ridgeway, Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern in 
Solana Beach; the Judds with Lionel Cartwright and McBride and the Ride, Friday 
at the Sports Arena; Commander Cody, Friday at the Belly Up Tavern; Rosie 
Flores, Friday at the Casbah in Middletown; Buck Owens, Sunday at Leo's Little 
Bit O' Country in San Marcos, and the Georgia Satellites, Sunday at the Belly 
Up.

COUNCIL OKS VOLUNTARY WATER RATIONING; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: A 12-1 VOTE SOUNDLY REJECTS THE MAYOR'S PLANS FOR MANDATORY 
REDUCTIONS. HOWEVER, THE COUNCIL'S PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDES THE CITY'S FIRST FINES 
FOR FLAGRANT WATER WASTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Soundly rejecting Mayor Tom Bradley's mandatory water rationing plan, the Los 
Angeles City Council on Tuesday gave final approval to a voluntary plan that 
includes the city's first fines for flagrant water wasters. 
</P>
<P>
In a 12-1 vote, the council sent Bradley a conservation plan that calls for 
mandatory rationing only if the city's residents and businesses fail to cut 
overall water usage by 10% in any month. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley signed the new ordinance Tuesday afternoon and it will take effect in 
several days. Bradley had wanted a mandatory rationing plan in place during the 
hot summer months when most of the city's water is consumed, but under the new 
ordinance no mandatory rationing can begin at least until September, and would 
require another vote of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance approved Tuesday bans lawn and garden watering between 10 a.m. 
and 5 p.m. and sets escalating fines of $50 to $150 for repeated violations. 
There is a loophole: The ban does not apply to professional gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
Fines also may be imposed for hosing of sidewalks, driveways and parking lots; 
failure to repair leaks; allowing water to flow into gutters, and serving water 
to restaurant customers who do not request it. 
</P>
<P>
In the most egregious cases, the Department of Water and Power may restrict the 
flow of water to a home or business or cut off the supply altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the wasteful practices have been banned since April, 1988, when drought 
conditions prompted city officials to impose the first phase of a so-called 
Emergency Water Conservation Plan. However, that plan, which will be superseded 
by the new measure, did not authorize fines for violations. 
</P>
<P>
About 22 "drought busters" working for the Department of Water and Power will 
enforce the toughened rules and issue citations to violators, said Ed 
Freudenberg, a DWP spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
DWP investigators have issued 3,000 warning letters for violations since last 
May 15, when the department kicked off a conservation push, he said. In that 
time, no one has been warned twice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite high temperatures and drought conditions, council members were 
skeptical of Bradley's call for rationing. DWP officials suggested mandatory 
conservation was not necessary. During April, May and June, the voluntary 
conservation effort has resulted in average water savings of 13.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Many council members also objected to the cost of implementing the program, 
saying it would add several dollars to every customer's monthly bill. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens of Los Angeles have responded despite unusually hot weather," 
said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who sponsored the voluntary measure. "I 
believe this is the right way to handle this rather than setting up a whole 
bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
When the voluntary conservation measure was approved tentatively two weeks ago, 
Bradley aides had promised to make a final run at turning the council toward a 
tougher, mandatory conservation plan. There was scant evidence that such an 
effort was made. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, overall city water use must remain at least 10% below a 
"normalized" level set by DWP analysts, or mandatory rationing may be imposed. 
The normalized level is set by a complex calculation that evaluates historic 
water use patterns as well as current weather, temperature and population data. 
</P>
<P>
If the mandatory portion is put into effect, all customers of the DWP -- both 
residential and business -- will be required to cut their water use by 10% from 
1986 levels. 
</P>
<P>
For the first violation, customers would be charged $3 a billing unit of excess 
use plus 15% of their total water bill. A billing unit is 748 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
A second violation would cost the customer $3 for each excess billing unit plus 
25% of the bill. A third violation would boost the surcharge to $4 an excess 
billing unit and 75% of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have moved since 1986 or did not live in the city then would be 
assigned an allotment based on the size of their home, the number of people in 
the household and the amount of landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP will assign allotment levels and inform all customers. 
</P>
<P>
WATER USE VIOLATIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Following are uses of water that are prohibited and punishable by fines of up 
to $150 under a new voluntary water conservation plan adopted by the Los 
Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosing of sidewalks, driveways and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Cleaning or filling of decorative fountains, ponds or lakes unless the water is 
part of a recycling system. 
</P>
<P>
Serving water to restaurant customers who do not request it. 
</P>
<P>
Failing to repair leaks quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Watering lawns, gardens and other turf areas between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing runoff into a sidewalk, driveway, street, ditch or gutter.

DESERT DOCTOR; 
</P>
<P>
HE MAKES HOUSE CALLS, BUT SOME DERIDE HIS TRAILSIDE MANNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The grimy pickup truck raises dust as it pulls into the driveway of a solitary 
house in the Antelope Valley desert, hauling an ancient trailer about the size 
and color of an elephant. 
</P>
<P>
The driver emerges from a tattered interior strewn with clothes, paper cups and 
other debris. He wears jeans, a soiled shirt and wraparound sunglasses with a 
pink frame. He carries a black toolbox containing medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Lawrence F. Smith MD, the wandering doctor of the desert. He only makes 
house calls. 
</P>
<P>
Smith lives wherever he parks his trailer in the barren expanse of the Antelope 
Valley, 70 miles north of downtown Los Angeles. His nomadic brand of medicine 
makes him one of a handful of doctors in Los Angeles County who treat patients 
exclusively in their homes, according to the county medical association. 
</P>
<P>
Smith does not have malpractice insurance and professes little interest in 
money. He claims to have rejected what he sees as the cold avarice of the 
medical establishment in order to provide compassionate health care to people 
in isolated and low-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the maverick, I'm the loner," said Smith, 44. "I'm not at the garden 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
For good reason, according to doctors and others in the local medical 
community. They describe Smith as a misfit whose unkempt appearance and 
dilapidated vehicle indicate a lack of professionalism. They are disturbed by 
the rambling, angry letters he fires off regularly to authority figures and the 
verbal confrontations he has had with other medical professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Most significant, Smith's lack of affiliation with a hospital allows him to 
evade scrutiny by peers, said his critics, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of what he says he's doing is wonderful," said one Lancaster 
doctor. "But I wish it was somebody else doing it. There's no way for organized 
medicine to review what he's doing and he refuses to submit to that review. I 
have a real uncomfortable feeling about him." 
</P>
<P>
None of those interviewed knew of any incidents of medical misconduct by Smith. 
Vern Leeper, director of enforcement for the Medical Board of California, said 
Smith's license is in good standing and he has not been the target of 
disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
One medical worker familiar with Smith's practice said she would never let him 
treat her. But she said he serves a unique population, many of them "desert 
rats" living meager existences. They probably would not get medical care 
otherwise, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good that he goes out to those rural areas," she said. "He does 
go out to people who cannot get another doctor." 
</P>
<P>
One such patient is Geneva Coughenour, 70, whom Smith treated recently for 
skinned elbows and emphysema at her house in the harsh landscape that is part 
of Lancaster but resembles Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate going into town," rasped Coughenour, a stick-thin chain-smoker. "You go 
in and sit with a dozen people in the waiting room. If you're not sick when you 
go in, you're sick when you come out." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Garcia of Palmdale, whose 88-year-old grandmother is Smith's patient, 
said: "My impression was that he was very thorough. I said here's one doctor 
who really cares about his job." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's grandmother, Mercedes, said Smith spent several hours on each visit 
treating her arthritis and a calcium deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he was a doctor without money," she said in Spanish. "I felt that 
he was very considerate." 
</P>
<P>
Although Smith eschews the aspects of establishment medicine that he finds 
bureaucratic and mercenary, he said he follows the same general treatment 
procedures as most other doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Though he is not much on fancy offices and fax machines, Smith does have a 
beeper, a cellular phone and an answering service so his patients can reach 
him. 
</P>
<P>
At the Lancaster doughnut shop where he takes care of his paper work, Smith 
described a career during which he has practiced at various hospitals and 
clinics around the country before adopting his more unstructured work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has alienated administrators and peers with obsessive criticism of 
problems he sees in the system, such as what he calls the "assembly-line 
medicine" of doctors who cram as many patients as possible into their 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to be a businessman," he said. "It makes you compromise. I 
could be seeing 40 patients a day, making money. . . . What I would have to do 
is throw out the window what I'm doing now, taking the extra hour to get into a 
line of questioning you (other doctors) should have gotten into. The kind of 
thing most physicians have pushed into their subconscious." 
</P>
<P>
Smith was born in Northern California and raised in San Bernardino County. He 
spent two years as an Army medic and got an undergraduate degree from Brigham 
Young University in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Practicing medicine was his ambition ever since he read the book "Dr. Dan the 
Bandage Man" as a boy, he said. He got his medical degree in 1975 at the 
University of Guadalajara in Mexico, according to American Medical Assn. 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Smith did yearlong internships in Canada and Michigan and started -- then 
abruptly quit -- a residency in family practice at a hospital in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, he started a practice in the dusty climes of Boron near Edwards Air 
Force Base. He says business foundered after he alleged that local doctors were 
unethical; a medical worker in Boron said Smith's antagonistic personality 
alienated doctors and patients alike. 
</P>
<P>
The end result: "I took my last bucks and I bought this trailer. I was going to 
be free of all this politics." 
</P>
<P>
For the past six years, Smith has been mobile. He said he earns $15,000 to 
$20,000 a year serving mainly Medi-Cal and Medicare clients. He charges $35 for 
the first visit and $25 for succeeding visits. 
</P>
<P>
Smith hopes to move his practice one day to greener country, perhaps Alaska. 
Such dreams require money, which is particularly scarce because the budget 
impasse in Sacramento has delayed his receipt of Medi-Cal payments for the past 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care that much about money, but I need it like everybody else," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith insists he is on an altruistic mission that highlights the failings of 
the profession he had always idealized. But his critics argue that doctoring in 
the desert is the only kind of work he can get. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever the truth lies, the maverick medic fits into the back-roads culture he 
serves. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be like, 'Jesus, this is desolate, this is like the moon,' " he said 
as his truck clattered past stark rows of Joshua trees. "It has grown on me."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STOLEN CAR TRACKING SYSTEM GOES ON LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An anti-theft system that uses radio signals to lead police to stolen cars went 
on line Tuesday in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The Stolen Vehicle Recovery Network's key component is a homing device, 
manufactured by the Massachusetts-based electronics firm LoJack. 
</P>
<P>
The system costs about $595 for a private citizen to install. When a 
LoJack-equipped car is reported stolen, police enter the report into the 
state's stolen vehicle system computer, which sends a radio signal from one of 
seven transmission towers throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
All but two police departments -- Culver City and Long Beach -- have joined the 
47-agency recovery network. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol is coordinating the three-year pilot program, 
which was unveiled at a news conference attended by county Sheriff's Department 
and Los Angeles police officials.

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley announced a major shake-up Tuesday in the commissions that 
help shape Los Angeles city policy, naming 21 newcomers to head the 
commissions, including the spouses of two top aides. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the personal relationship of two appointees to his aides, the mayor 
said the appointments reflected a broad cross-section of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
One appointee is Harry Usher, the No. 2 man in the Los Angeles Olympic 
Organizing Committee, who was named to the Cultural Affairs panel. Usher, who 
also was president of the U.S. Football League, is married to Bradley's legal 
counsel, Jane Ellison. Julie Depoian, who is married to Bradley aide Phil 
Depoian, was named to the Civil Service Commission, Bradley's press secretary 
Bill Chandler said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARMORED CAR ROBBERS FLEE INTO SHOPPING MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two well-dressed men held up an armored-car guard Tuesday morning outside the 
Sherman Oaks Galleria and escaped with $10,000 by running into the shopping 
mall, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
No shots were fired and no one was hurt in the 9:30 a.m. robbery on the steps 
outside the mall at Ventura and Sepulveda boulevards, Lt. Sal Hoyos said. 
</P>
<P>
A Loomis Armored Inc. guard had just made a money pickup at Home Federal 
Savings inside the mall and was on his way back to his armored truck parked 
outside the mall when he was robbed. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyos said the guard, whose name was not released, was going down the steps 
outside the mall when two men stuck the barrels of guns into his back. The two 
clean-cut men wore gray business suits and no masks. Both had automatic 
pistols, Hoyos said.

ROBBER WHO SURVIVED SHOOT-OUT THAT KILLED 3 ACCOMPLICES IS JAILED 17 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A robber who survived a police shoot-out that left his three accomplices dead 
outside a McDonald's restaurant in Sunland was sentenced Tuesday to 17 years in 
prison for a string of holdups of fast-food businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Olivas, 19, of Hollywood pleaded guilty June 15 to 10 robbery counts 
after prosecutors dropped three counts of murder, which were filed against him 
under a state law that holds lawbreakers responsible for deaths that occur 
during the commission of their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors also dropped two kidnaping and seven 
other felony counts and agreed not to seek a prison term longer than 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Olivas, who was wounded in the Feb. 12 shoot-out, faced two life sentences if 
convicted of the kidnaping charges alone and could have been sentenced to death 
if convicted of the murder counts, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth L. Barshop said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to prove that Olivas 
provoked the shoot-out, which occurred after Olivas and the other men robbed a 
McDonald's on Foothill Boulevard of more than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that members of the Los Angeles Police Department's Special 
Investigations Section fired 35 rounds at the men after Olivas allegedly 
pointed a gun at the officers, who were approaching the suspects' parked car 
after observing them commit the after-hours robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The SIS officers had been shadowing the men in connection with a series of as 
many as 17 robberies of fast-food restaurants allegedly carried out by the 
group in the Los Angeles area between August, 1989, and the Feb. 12 shoot-out 
in Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. Major on Tuesday granted Olivas' 
request to be sent to state prison rather than serve part of his sentence in a 
California Youth Authority facility, an option that was offered because of his 
age. Olivas said he believed that he would be the victim of gang violence if 
sent to a juvenile facility. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a violent person," Olivas told Major. "I know I did wrong for doing 
these kinds of robberies. I know I'm going to pay for it, but I want to do it 
as calmly and peacefully as possible." 
</P>
<P>
But Barshop said Olivas acted violently, even though the defendant and the 
other suspects carried unloaded pellet guns during the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Barshop said Olivas participated in at least four of the robberies committed by 
the group. The prosecutor said that on at least two occasions, the group 
kidnaped managers of McDonald's restaurants from their homes, drove them to the 
restaurants after hours and forced them to open safes at gunpoint. Also, Olivas 
admitted handcuffing Robin Cox, manager of the Sunland McDonald's, who was then 
forced to give the men the combination to the store's safe, Barshop said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Olivas states he went in there with a gun," Barshop said. "Why did he go 
in there with a gun but to cause terror to Ms. Cox?" 
</P>
<P>
Olivas' lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Howard C. Waco, said the nine SIS 
officers who shot Olivas and his companions carried out an "assassination." He 
said that according to police reports of the shooting, two of the officers shot 
two suspects at point-blank range from behind as they sat in the parked getaway 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Waco also said the officers could not have seen inside the vehicle because it 
had tinted windows, which were rolled up when the shooting broke out. 
</P>
<P>
But Major, while not disputing the police report, said the officers acted 
appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
"What would the police be expected to do under those circumstances?" Major 
asked. "I don't think we can really place any blame on the police officers.

SUPERVISORS CREATE AN AGENCY TO PLACE SALES TAX ON BALLOT; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: HALF-CENT INCREASE WOULD RAISE $423 MILLION A YEAR FOR NEW JAILS. 
SCHABARUM OPPOSES PLAN AND ACCUSES HIS COLLEAGUES OF 'SHAM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday created an agency to place a half-cent 
sales tax increase on the November ballot to pay for new jails. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum accused his colleagues of creating a "sham" agency to 
get around the requirement of Proposition 13 for two-thirds voter approval for 
a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief administrative officer, recommended 
seeking approval of the tax increase. He said that raising the sales tax by 
half a cent to 7 cents would raise $423 million a year for construction and 
operation of jails. 
</P>
<P>
The tax increase is necessary, Dixon told supervisors, to relieve jail 
overcrowding, which has forced the early release of more than 250,000 minor 
offenders. A June, 1988, court order limits county jail population to 22,000 
adult prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"The juvenile detention system is also faced with ever-growing detention needs 
and antiquated facilities which cannot provide adequate programs and security," 
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
The sales tax increase requires a simple majority vote for approval under state 
legislation passed last year, said County Counsel DeWitt Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
State legislation sought by Los Angeles County and five other counties and 
approved last year allowed counties to create special agencies to raise funds 
for jail construction. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation was declared unconstitutional by a Sacramento judge after a 
lawsuit was filed by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers' Assn. Los Angeles County 
appealed. Pending the outcome of the appeal, a state appeals court last week 
lifted the injunction that had prevented counties from implementing the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 Tuesday over Schabarum's objections to 
establish the Los Angeles County Regional Justices Facilities Financing Agency 
to place the half-cent sales tax increase on the ballot. The agency will be 
chaired by Sheriff Sherman Block and consist of four other law enforcement 
officials. Supervisors will have final say over when and where jails are built. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum accused his colleagues of a "lack of backbone" in creating the agency 
to avoid taking the political heat for proposing a tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman said the tax increase would free county funds for 
strapped health and welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
On another issue, supervisors delayed for one week a vote on placing a measure 
on the November ballot to create an elected county executive. Edelman and 
Schabarum, who support the measure, are hoping to pick up the third vote 
required to place it on the ballot from Supervisor Kenneth Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn insisted that supervisors also ask voters to expand the board to seven 
members in return for his support. 
</P>
<P>
With powers similar to those of a governor, the executive would prepare the 
budget, veto ordinances and appoint department heads. The board would continue 
as the legislative body with authority to confirm the executive's appointments, 
adopt ordinances and override vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana oppose the1 measure.

BETTY FORD CENTER OPENS L.A. BRANCH OF TREATMENT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE WIELAWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles branch of the Betty Ford Center opens today on West Olympic 
Boulevard, the first expansion since Mrs. Ford created the center eight years 
ago to help people overcome drug and alcohol addictions similar to those she 
suffered during her husband's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The center in the desert community of Rancho Mirage has drawn celebrities as 
well as thousands of others, 40% of whom live in Southern California. The 
decision to open a Los Angeles branch was motivated partly by concern for 
alumni of the Rancho Mirage facility who could benefit from nearby staff and 
support programs, Mrs. Ford said. The Los Angeles facility will provide an 
option for those whose circumstances make difficult a four-week, $8,000 stay in 
the desert, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Ford said she had to overcome reservations about having more than one 
center. The Los Angeles facility is organized as an extension of the main 
program in Rancho Mirage and does not represent a move to spin off franchises, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility, called the Betty Ford Center Outpatient Program, is located 
in a rented suite at 11340 W. Olympic Boulevard. It offers support groups and 
follow-up care for Rancho Mirage graduates and their families, plus an 
after-work outpatient program four days a week. Candidates for the evening 
program include those for whom an extended stay at Rancho Mirage is 
inconvenient or too costly. The after-work program runs seven weeks and costs 
$4,000. 
</P>
<P>
An additional after-work program, exclusively for women, will start in the 
fall. In a recent interview, Mrs. Ford said she is especially keen on this 
program, having publicized her own battle with drug and alcohol abuse to draw 
attention to the neglect of women by addiction professionals. 
</P>
<P>
She has continued to press the point as president of the Betty Ford Center 
board of directors. Women-only programs were started at Rancho Mirage in 1984, 
after staff members observed that some women were reticent in co-educational 
treatment groups. The center is conducting studies to see if there is a 
difference in long-term recovery between women who went through the program in 
co-ed groups and those in groups of only women. 
</P>
<P>
"Women have been known for years as the hidden alcoholic or the closet 
alcoholic because of the role they play in the family," Mrs. Ford said. "As the 
mother or the grandmother or sister or whatever, they are expected to be the 
nurturing person who takes care of others and doesn't have problems. 
</P>
<P>
"In groups, they tend to sit back and urge the men forward to talk about 
themselves and they never talk about themselves," she said. "They are not 
allowed to do that in a women's group." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Ford recalled her own treatment at Long Beach Naval Hospital in 1978. Most 
of the other patients were men, with the common experience of naval careers. 
</P>
<P>
"The few women who were there were young girls in the Navy and I was a 
60-year-old woman," said Mrs. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Having little in common with other patients, Mrs. Ford believes, made it 
difficult for her to come to grips with her illness. Most of her insight came 
from talking to other women her age who were recovering from addictions. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Ford's problems with alcohol and drugs came as she tried to perform 
perfectly the traditional roles of wife and mother. Treatment, she said, helped 
her realize that it was acceptable to fall short of perfection, even to have 
some weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
Although options have broadened, Mrs. Ford said the reality for many career 
women is simply a heavier load of responsibilities and expectations. They seem 
to have an especially hard time acknowledging addiction, she said, and to 
suffer a more profound sense of failure. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles facility is expected to operate in the red for the first 18 
months while it builds clientele. The nonprofit center is trying to keep fees 
low, Mrs. Ford said, so it can serve patients without the financial resources 
of celebrities who have helped the center become well known.

BERNSON ASSAILS SIMI VALLEY VOTE TO SUE OVER PORTER RANCH PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO and BETSY BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Hal Bernson lashed out at the Simi Valley City Council on 
Tuesday for voting to sue Los Angeles over the Porter Ranch development, saying 
the council acted rashly and probably will fail in its quest to block the 
colossal project. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said Simi Valley officials should welcome Porter Ranch for the jobs it 
will provide, rather than file an expensive lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just surprised that they didn't do a little more homework," said Bernson, 
whose district includes Porter Ranch in the western San Fernando Valley. "I 
think the City Council acted very rashly. I think they have been duped by the 
political opponents of Porter Ranch." 
</P>
<P>
But Simi Valley officials defended the action they took Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to take action because you are too timid or because you're afraid of 
losing is not the way to go," said Councilman Glen McAdoo. "When you have right 
on your side, you have an obligation to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted in closed session to sue Los Angeles to halt the Porter Ranch 
development. The project, which would include 3,395 residences and 6 million 
square feet of commercial space, would be built in Chatsworth, about five miles 
east of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The directors of PRIDE, the homeowners group opposed to Porter Ranch, said they 
planned to meet privately Tuesday night with San Francisco attorney Mark 
Weinberger to discuss legal strategy, which may involve filing an independent 
lawsuit, spokesman Don Worsham said. 
</P>
<P>
Worsham said he was heartened by the council's action. "We applaud and respect 
them for doing what is necessary to protect their community." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials said the project, which would rank with Century City as 
one of the largest developments in Los Angeles history, would create tremendous 
amounts of smog in the region and turn the Simi Valley Freeway into a parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
They said that their concerns about these issues were not adequately addressed 
in the environmental impact report and, therefore, that they have no choice but 
to take legal action. 
</P>
<P>
According to the environmental impact report approved by the Los Angeles City 
Council, the development would generate an additional 150,602 vehicle trips per 
day in the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said the report does not adequately answer 
questions about how and when Los Angeles and the developer would compensate for 
the added traffic congestion and smog. Simi Valley officials want the project 
to be built in phases, with approval of each phase contingent on actual 
construction of additional freeway lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson blamed Simi Valley for many of the traffic tie-ups on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"A great deal of the traffic on the Simi Valley Freeway is generated by Simi 
Valley residents who work in Los Angeles," he said. "They've allowed hundreds 
of thousands of homes to be built without jobs and other amenities that the 
community needs." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson also suggested that, in the future, Los Angeles may impose an 
employment tax against non-city residents. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials said they do not know how much it will cost to fight the 
planned development in court, but they believe it will be considerably less 
than the $500,000 some suggested it would cost.

MUBARAK ACTS TO DEFUSE CRISIS IN PERSIAN GULF

<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak plunged into emergency diplomacy Tuesday to 
bridge the noisy rift between Iraq and Kuwait, as the Pentagon announced 
"short-notice" naval maneuvers for U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak met privately in Baghdad with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and in 
Kuwait with Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, the emir or ruler, on a day when 
Iraq again accused the oil-rich sheikdom of conspiring to destroy its economy 
and massed at least 30,000 troops on the Kuwaiti border. Iraq also reportedly 
has posted more than 200 Soviet-made tanks along the border. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hussein who triggered the open hostilities last week, setting the region 
on edge, by accusing Kuwait of scheming to drive down Iraq's oil revenues by 
undercutting production quotas of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait on Tuesday canceled leave for its 20,000-member military, which would be 
no match for the battle-tested legions of Iraq, one of the Middle East's 
predominant military powers. Baghdad has an army of more than 400,000 
well-trained and well-equipped troops. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Kuwait has depended upon its economic vitality and its diplomatic 
resourcefulness to protect it from would-be predators. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Pentagon said six U.S. warships were ordered to begin 
"short-notice" maneuvers in the Persian Gulf with naval vessels of the United 
Arab Emirates. Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said two of the U.S. ships cut 
short port calls to participate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned about the (Iraqi) buildup," White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater declared. "It is a delicate situation. We urge all parties to avoid 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler confirmed the buildup 
and said, "Iraq and others know there is no place for coercion and intimidation 
in a civilized world." She added that Kuwait has moved an undisclosed number of 
troops to the border with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. naval maneuvers, dubbed "Exercise Ivory Justice" by the Pentagon, also 
involve two U.S. Air Force KC-135 air refueling tankers and one C-141 cargo 
plane hauling maintenance and repair equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the show of force underscores the fact that the United States has 
"longstanding agreements and commitments with our friends in the region." 
During the Persian Gulf War between Iran and Iraq, the U.S. provided naval 
escorts for Kuwaiti oil tankers in the gulf to protect them from attacks. The 
U.S. interest in peace and safety there "hasn't changed," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Later Tuesday, Mubarak pressed on with his whirlwind mediation mission during a 
windup stop in Saudi Arabia to meet with King Fahd, whose country is the No. 1 
oil producer in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"My trip is aimed at resolving the present crisis . . . and clearing the 
atmosphere," state-owned Cairo Radio quoted Mubarak as saying Tuesday night. 
The radio described Mubarak's talks with Hussein and the emir as "successful." 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak reportedly was trying to arrange a Cairo meeting between the Iraqi and 
Kuwaiti foreign ministers to defuse the confrontation over oil policies. 
According to today's editions of the Cairo newspaper Al Gomhouriya, he also 
presented a four-point peace proposal to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
With Hussein's propaganda machine unrelenting in its attack on Kuwaiti 
officials, the reports of troop deployments near the border heightened the 
crisis atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Some military analysts said they doubt that an outbreak of fighting is likely, 
despite the belligerent tone of the Iraqi campaign and the always-tense 
atmosphere in the gulf states. 
</P>
<P>
"It was designed to (frighten) Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates," said 
analyst Don Kerr of London's International Institute for Strategic Studies. He 
was commenting on the Iraqi threats of violence and Hussein's chilling remark 
last week that "Iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better 
than cutting means of living." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a propaganda exercise" designed to force support for Iraq's oil goals, 
Kerr added. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, one U.S. Mideast military expert, Anthony Cordesman, who is a 
defense adviser to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), described the oil-rich sheikdom 
as "an extraordinarily tempting target" for Iraq. Expecting to mount a military 
defense, he added, "is a little like asking Luxembourg to defend itself against 
East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Military experts said that if Iraq continues aggressive posturing, Saudi Arabia 
and the United States likely would step up flights of Saudi-owned AWACS 
(airborne warning and control system) aircraft, which are manned in part by 
U.S. operators. Those aircraft could detect any early Iraqi bid to secure the 
air over Kuwait or the Persian Gulf and would serve as command and control 
stations in the event that the air forces of the United States and the Gulf 
states came to Kuwait's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has blustered before about Kuwait, suggesting that several of the 
emirate's coastal islands were wrongfully taken from Iraq and should be 
returned. The islands, such as Bubiyan Island just outside of the fiercely 
disputed Shatt al Arab waterway between Iran and Iraq, would extend Iraq's 
coast on the gulf and ease its ability to export oil. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi told the state news agency Tuesday 
that Baghdad's views in the current crisis will prevail at this week's crucial 
OPEC meeting in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of the recent contacts and meetings by OPEC states showed 
unanimous support for Iraq's stand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad, painfully short of hard currency to rebuild its war-damaged economy, 
wants more dollars for its oil and demands that its OPEC partners curtail 
production to drive up the price -- currently less than $17 a barrel -- to $25 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Kuwait and another small gulf nation, the United Arab 
Emirates, have refused to be bound by their OPEC production quotas, industry 
analysts say, and have flooded the market in search of a large world share, 
driving down the price. 
</P>
<P>
Steady oil prices became the first victim of the confrontation Tuesday, kicked 
upward by fears of instability. The London market recorded an early 50-cent 
jump on September oil futures, to $19.60 a barrel. The spot price for immediate 
deliveries was about $16.50, up more than $2 a barrel from its level of several 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan -- totally dependent on imported oil, with most of it from the gulf -- 
the dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
Prices began rising after a July 11 meeting in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, where 
Kuwait and the Emirates pledged to hold production within their OPEC quotas 
until the issue of prices and quotas is taken up at the Geneva ministerial 
meeting, which begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, with Kuwait and the Emirates sticking to their Jidda pledge 
according to industry analysts, Baghdad launched its bruising propaganda attack 
on Kuwait. In a letter to the Arab League, it accused the sheikdom of 
undermining oil prices in collusion with the United States, militarily 
occupying Iraqi territory and siphoning oil from an Iraqi field. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait denied the charges in its own letter to the league and said Iraq's 
history is "rich" with violations of Kuwaiti territory -- but the tiny nation 
tempered its language in an apparent attempt to not provoke the volatile 
Hussein. Nevertheless, Baghdad took offense at every Kuwaiti counterargument. 
</P>
<P>
The barrage became personal this week when Baghdad's government-controlled 
press accused Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah, an 
influential member of the ruling family, of being an American tool and coveting 
the post of emir for himself.

AND THEN THERE WERE 2 AND FINALLY 1 -- SOUTER; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: NOMINEE SELECTED OVER TEXAS WOMAN PRIMARILY FOR HIS LACK OF 'PAPER 
TRAIL' ON CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES.

<P>
In the end, the decision came down to two candidates and one issue. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates were David H. Souter of New Hampshire and Edith H. Jones of 
Texas. And the issue, according to officials involved in the process of picking 
the next justice of the Supreme Court, was not abortion, but politics -- did 
President Bush want an ideological war or a smooth, non-disruptive confirmation 
process. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-hour-long process of picking a successor to retired Justice William J. 
Brennan Jr. began with a flurry of telephone calls Friday night. It ended with 
a simple meeting Monday in Bush's private study, where the President offered 
the lifetime appointment to Souter. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Bush and top aides winnowed a list of potential nominees to eight, 
then four, then finally to two. Souter's intellect, particularly impressive in 
one-on-one meetings, was a persuasive factor, Bush aides said. But even more 
important was his lack of a "paper trail" on controversial issues that would 
have opened the way for a long and rancorous confirmation fight. 
</P>
<P>
The key event, according to officials familiar with the process, was a 
90-minute meeting Sunday night with Bush and four advisers in the White House 
residential quarters. Earlier that day, four candidates had been in the running 
-- Souter, a former New Hampshire Supreme Court justice who was appointed to 
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this year; Jones, a conservative 
judge on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, who sits in Houston; Solicitor 
Gen. Kenneth W. Starr and federal Appeals Court Judge Laurence Silberman in the 
District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman and Starr are based in Washington. The other two had been summoned to 
the capital by White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, who had reached them by 
telephone Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
But as Bush and his advisers began the evening meeting, the President quickly 
knocked first Starr, then Silberman off the list, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Bush turned to Vice President Dan Quayle, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, 
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Gray and divided them into teams 
to argue the merits of the two remaining candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle and Sununu were told to make the case for Jones, while Gray and 
Thornburgh were given Souter. The cagey maneuver neutralized both Sununu's own 
personal fondness for Souter, whom as governor he had appointed to the New 
Hampshire Supreme Court, and the strong pro-Jones bias of some members of 
Gray's staff. 
</P>
<P>
For more than an hour, the two sides argued as Bush took notes. Naming Jones, 
the conservative favorite, would be "a strong 'in your face' political 
appointment," Quayle and Sununu argued, according to an official familiar with 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Thornburgh and Gray counseled Bush that "there would be other 
times to do that, a better time to appoint Jones or someone like her," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as another White House official put it, "the President is likely to have 
another appointment" given the age of several members of the high court. "Maybe 
the second time around you'll see a 'hotter' nominee." 
</P>
<P>
"The next couple of months, when the confirmation hearings will take place, 
will be right smack in the middle of an election cycle," the official said. A 
major confirmation fight at that point, particularly one waged over the 
emotional issue of abortion, "could have thrown things out of whack." 
</P>
<P>
"There was a desire to move quickly and in a non-disruptive way, and the way 
you can do this is with an extraordinarily impressive candidate who has a 
relatively thin" paper record on the most controversial issues, a senior 
Justice Department official explained. 
</P>
<P>
Souter was that candidate. By contrast, Jones has been for several years a 
favorite speaker at meetings of the Federalist Society, an association of 
conservative activist lawyers whose members have provided many of the young 
judicial clerks and Justice Department and White House special assistants who 
charted the conservative path during the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also had written a number of judicial opinions that contained a notably 
conservative tone and rhetoric, although she had no clear statements on 
abortion in her file. Silberman was also considered a conservative activist and 
one whose reputation for temper has worried officials in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Starr, the government's advocate before the high court and an early favorite 
for the job, was viewed as less ideological than Jones. But he did have a clear 
abortion stand attached to his name. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Starr had been directed by the Administration to file a brief with 
the Supreme Court urging the justices to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 
decision that made abortion legal in the nation. His obedience now came back to 
haunt him -- Bush feared that Starr's name on that brief would have "ensured 
that abortion would be center stage," said one senior official. 
</P>
<P>
For the White House, the process began at roughly 7:30 p.m. Friday when two law 
clerks from Brennan's office arrived with the justice's letter of resignation. 
Bush was on Air Force One flying back to Washington from an afternoon of 
fishing in Wyoming. And by the time Sununu contacted him with the information, 
the news already was on television, radio and news wire services and had 
reached the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Bush directed Sununu to convene a meeting early Saturday morning with Gray and 
Thornburgh -- Quayle was at Bethesda Naval Hospital with his wife, who was 
undergoing surgery -- to begin a process that had been carefully prepared 
months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
When the process began, Thornburgh and Gray presented Bush with an extensive 
series of files that their staffs had drawn up summarizing the legal writings 
and other statements of potential nominees. An Administration source said that 
the President "got the whole spiel," a sharp contrast with former President 
Reagan, who allowed his aides to largely select nominees for him, only getting 
involved to formally offer them the job at the end. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Bush, the senior advisers met again to continue 
winnowing down the list to a shorter, eight-person slate. Jones was the only 
woman on that "short list," according to officials involved in the process. The 
list also included one black judge, Clarence Thomas, a colleague of Silberman's 
on the federal appeals court here, and one Latino, Judge Ricardo Hinojosa of 
Texas. The President "had a high view" of Hinojosa, said a participant in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, as Bush reviewed the candidates, names were crossed off, officials 
said. Finally, Sunday afternoon, Bush told Gray to call Souter and Jones to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Souter was in his judicial office in Concord, spending a mild, sunny Sunday 
afternoon indoors reading law. Shortly after Gray reached him, he called his 
longtime friend and political mentor, Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), who had 
gone home from Washington to his home state. 
</P>
<P>
" 'You can tell nobody this but I've just talked to the White House legal 
counsel, Mr. Gray, and they've asked me to come to Washington, and I suppose I 
should,' " Rudman later recalled that Souter had said. 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'What do you mean you suppose you should?' " 
</P>
<P>
" 'Well,' he said, 'there are a lot of wonderful judges in this country, and 
I'm sure the President must know them personally, and, you know, I don't know 
the President, I've never been involved in politics. Why would he want me?' " 
</P>
<P>
"You pack a suitcase and I'll pick you up," Rudman said he responded. 
</P>
<P>
Rudman drove Souter to the Manchester, N.H., airport, stopping along the way at 
an ice cream store. The senator got ice cream while Souter, true to his ascetic 
image, drank a cup of coffee. At the airport, the senator lent his friend some 
cash and put him on the plane. He flew coach. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, meanwhile, was flying north from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush met with his advisers to debate the merits of the two candidates 
Sunday, White House aides met them separately at the airport. The White House 
was reluctant to have either candidate spend the night at a hotel for fear that 
word they were in Washington would leak out. But Souter, who is virtually 
unknown in Washington, had nowhere to stay because Rudman was still in New 
Hampshire. White House aides arranged for him to spend the night at the home of 
an Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Gray interviewed Souter, satisfying himself that there were "no 
skeletons" in the judge's closet. Souter was asked a series of questions. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at 1:30 p.m., after Bush had concluded a meeting with the visiting 
president of Ecuador, Souter was ushered into the White House residence, where 
he met with Bush for 45 minutes. Aides had prepared a list of questions for 
Bush but the President had crossed two off because he felt they were too close 
to asking about specific issues -- an approach that he had decided to avoid, 
the senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones met with Bush next, in the Oval Office, while Souter waited down the hall 
in the office of Deputy White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Bush finished interviewing Jones about 3 p.m., officials said. As Jones and 
Souter waited in the White House West Wing, Bush pondered six pages of notes, 
written in longhand, on which he had listed the candidates' pros and cons. Of 
Souter, he had written: "He's a scholarly man . . . he has a good education . . 
. he has been recommended by legal authorities . . . he has a good record in 
lower courts," said the senior official, adding that he had never seen Bush 
prepare such an extensive memorandum to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at 3:30, Bush called his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, to the Oval Office, 
told him he wanted to make his court announcement that day and asked how much 
time he had to make up his mind. Fitzwater -- with an eye on news media 
deadlines -- suggested a decision should be announced by 4:30 p.m. Bush said he 
needed an extra half hour. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:15 p.m., Bush called Fitzwater again, told him he had selected Souter, 
gave him the nominee's biographical information, and asked where Souter was 
waiting. While an aide informed Jones that she was not the choice, Bush 
escorted Souter into his personal study.

CROWD FORCES JUDGE TO HALT SOVIET ANTI-SEMITISM TRIAL 
</P>

<P>
Rowdy supporters of a man charged with inciting hostility against Jews forced a 
Soviet judge Tuesday to adjourn the man's trial almost before it began in a 
case that has become the symbol of blatant and growing anti-Semitism among 
Russian nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of unruly spectators sitting on wooden benches and packed into the 
aisles of the steamy courtroom repeatedly interrupted the short proceedings by 
loudly clapping in response to comments made by defendant Konstantin 
Smirnov-Ostashvili, 64, and shouting angry demands such as "Toss out the 
liberal journalists!" 
</P>
<P>
Smirnov-Ostashvili, a charismatic leader of Russian ultranationalists, is the 
first person in the Soviet Union to face charges of inciting ethnic strife, 
according to the official news agency Tass. Soviet law prohibits inciting 
ethnic violence, racial hostility or religious animosity. If convicted, 
Smirnov-Ostashvili could spend up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Smirnov-Ostashvili, a blue-collar worker, is accused of organizing a group of 
Russian nationalists who interrupted a political forum of liberals at the 
Central House of Writers in January. The intruders roughed up the participants, 
called them "Yids" and shouted, "Go to Tel Aviv!" 
</P>
<P>
No one was seriously injured, and Smirnov-Ostashvili, who used a megaphone to 
shout down the speakers at the forum, is the only one charged. 
</P>
<P>
But the case was so controversial that the investigation took several months 
and interviews with 400 witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's decision on whether to try Smirnov-Ostashvili and the others 
involved in the fracas became a test of the government's willingness to 
confront increasing anti-Semitism here. 
</P>
<P>
With the trial as a political battlefield between ultranationalists and 
liberals, the courtroom was packed even before the proceedings began. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments broke out almost immediately between the defendant's supporters and 
his opponents. Several television crews and dozens of Soviet and foreign 
journalists flooded into the front of the courtroom, surrounding the judge and 
the defendant and adding to the mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
Smirnov-Ostashvili, a fiery man with a wreath of gray hair surrounding a large 
bald spot, started off the proceedings by brashly demanding that the judge oust 
Yuri D. Chernichenko, a liberal member of Parliament acting as the public 
prosecutor, from the front of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The nationalists in the crowd, many of whom had straggly beards and wore black 
clothing, cheered loudly when the judge, Andrei I. Muratov, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Smirnov-Ostashvili next asked to have his publicly appointed lawyer taken off 
his case, claiming that she is part of the Jewish-dominated Moscow lawyers 
association. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he would like to be represented by a lawyer from West Germany, 
Finland, Sweden or Norway. His followers in the hall chanted "Shame!" when 
Muratov denied the request for the dismissal of his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The tumult was so great that Muratov announced a 30-minute recess in an effort 
to restore order in the crowded courtroom. But the confrontation between the 
nationalists and the liberals over the merits of the case only grew hotter 
during the break. 
</P>
<P>
When Muratov returned, he asked the spectators to clear the aisles, but they 
only retreated a few steps. With no control over his courtroom, Muratov 
adjourned the case until today. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant's supporters included young, old and middle-aged men and women. 
Many said they were members of Russian Patriots or Pamyat, two ultranationalist 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I have heard a lot about him, and I support him because he is fighting for 
Russia," Liliya I. Bogoroditskaya, 58, a grandmotherly woman wearing a popular 
Russian nationalist pin of St. George slaying a dragon, said of 
Smirnov-Ostashvili. 
</P>
<P>
"I like his platform. He's fighting against Zionism, and this is necessary 
because the news media is totally in their hands -- television, radio and the 
press. And culture and art, too. You won't find one of them (Jews) working. Not 
one in a factory nor in a village." 
</P>
<P>
Liberals in the courtroom said a guilty verdict is necessary to fight the 
popular trend of blaming Jews for everything from food shortages to the 
Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very important," Stella I. Aleinikova, a tiny woman in her 70s who had 
videotaped the original incident at the House of Writers, said as she walked 
out of the courthouse with her camera again on her arm. "It would be the start 
of a very strong anti-fascist movement." 
</P>
<P>
Oleg Fainstein, 32, a liberal writer who witnessed the January incident, 
commented: "I hope anti-Semitism, which has so far been denied to exist at all, 
will at least be acknowledged. It will set a precedent." 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of Smirnov-Ostashvili contended that a verdict of innocent will 
enshrine the right to freedom of expression in a country where speaking out has 
often been paid for with death. 
</P>
<P>
"Human freedom is being tried here," Alexander Kulakov, the 28-year-old 
executive secretary of the People's Orthodox Movement, said. "It is a human 
right to say what you are thinking. They are trying to do away with someone who 
just said what he thought." 
</P>
<P>
Even Pravda, the Communist Party daily, has acknowledged that anti-Semitism is 
rising and threatens to undermine the country's political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Jews had long been victims of official discrimination in the Soviet Union, 
which kept them out of universities and top-level political jobs and prevented 
them from openly practicing their faith. But the discrimination has been 
significantly reduced in the last five years.

AD LINKS LIQUOR TAX TO LOTTERY PROMISES

Hoping to capitalize on voter skepticism about campaign promises, alcoholic 
beverage interests began Tuesday spending $1 million on television advertising 
that attempts to link a beer, wine and liquor tax hike proposal with pledges 
made in the successful 1984 effort to pass a state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
In one advertisement, a teacher looks into the camera and says, "Remember those 
promises about all that lottery money for schools? I wonder where it all went. 
Well, now they're at it again with this foolish proposition." 
</P>
<P>
The lottery reference appears in one of three commercials that Taxpayers for 
Common Sense, an industry-funded organization, began airing statewide as part 
of a television advertising campaign to defeat Proposition 134. The proposal -- 
called the "nickel-a-drink tax" by its supporters -- would impose stiff new 
taxes on the industry and earmark revenue from them for programs relating to 
the treatment and prevention of alcohol and drug abuse. The industry is 
supporting another ballot measure, Proposition 126, which would impose a 
smaller tax and let the Legislature determine how the revenue would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Manter, the organization's executive director, said the ads will run for 
two to four weeks, depending on how "well they wear." 
</P>
<P>
"Political commercials wear out real fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 134, who read transcripts of the new commercials, 
labeled them "misleading," complaining that they erroneously suggest that most 
of the tax revenue would not go to alcohol-related programs as promised by the 
nickel-a-drink campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the revenue) all goes to a variety of programs carefully chosen by the 
people most concerned about alcohol abuse," said Rusty Selix, legislative 
representative for the California Council of Community Mental Health Agencies 
and an author of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Manter said the ads hope to take advantage of what political consultants 
believe is a general perception that the California Lottery has not solved the 
funding crisis in the schools as voters expected. At least 34% of lottery 
revenues automatically go to education, but they cover only about 3% of school 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do with the commercial is to fold what is really a great 
skepticism over the promises made by promoters of initiatives with the reality 
that often followed them," Manter said. 
</P>
<P>
To get its message across, Manter acknowledged, the alcoholic beverage industry 
will be able to outspend its opponents by millions of dollars. Taxpayers for 
Common Sense has already reported collecting $10.7 million and is expected to 
show an additional $2 million in reports to be filed next week. 
</P>
<P>
Manter said most of the money will be spent on television and radio advertising 
that will be aired between now and the November election. 
</P>
<P>
He said the campaign is starting its television advertising early so it won't 
be confused with other political advertising, particularly in the gubernatorial 
race between Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get ahead and communicate a couple of messages very simply and 
clearly before the clutter starts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Jervis, a public relations consultant for Taxpayers for Common Sense, said 
viewers tend to become confused about who is saying what when they have to see 
a succession of political advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a much better sell if you're next door to a General Motors ad than if 
you're . . . sandwiched by Feinstein and Wilson," he said.

FISCAL STANDOFF MAY AID SCHABARUM INITIATIVE 
</P>

<P>
Someone finally dared to say the "S-word" out loud on the state Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
The S-word, shorthand for the "Schabarum Initiative," had been only whispered 
around the Capitol as the political equivalent of a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, as Assembly Democrats and Republicans again took to blaming each 
other for the highly publicized failure to pass a new state budget, Assemblyman 
William Baker (R-Danville) turned to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) and said the unspeakable: 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think you won the press war last week? I don't think you won. I don't 
think we won. I think Schabarum won." 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum is pugnacious Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, a 
Republican and sponsor of a radical ballot initiative that would strike hard at 
what many elected state office holders hold most dear: incumbency, pensions and 
their own budgets. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would impose for the first time limits on terms of office -- from 
the governor and to top state officials and legislators. It would also abolish 
the generous retirement program of legislators and enact stiff cutbacks in the 
Legislature's own spending. 
</P>
<P>
While many in the Legislature regard the Schabarum proposal, Proposition 140, 
as a direct attack upon them, it will be one of two such proposals to go before 
voters on Nov. 6. Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp is sponsoring a similar 
initiative to limit terms of legislators and state officeholders, Proposition 
131. 
</P>
<P>
The Van de Kamp measure whipped up a firestorm of anger in the Legislature 
earlier as he campaigned unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
State government is approaching the fourth week without a budget because of a 
political standoff between Assembly Democrats and Republican Gov. George 
Deukmejian and his Assembly GOP allies. Many legislators, their staffers, 
lobbyists, political consultants and others have begun voicing concern that the 
deadlock will play into the hands of Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the impasse, it helps that initiative because it's just something 
that will strike against the Legislature," said Senate leader David A. Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, Sen. Ed Davis of Santa Clarita said the "embarrassing" 
deadlock has provided "the greatest campaign propaganda that Pete Schabarum 
could ever imagine." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Schabarum, who spent five years in the Assembly before he was 
appointed to the Board of Supervisors by Gov. Ronald Reagan in 1972 and will 
retire this year, viewed the paralysis as a big reason to vote for his 
so-called "Political Reform Act of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly another example of . . . a major issue that the Legislature 
chooses not to deal with," he said Tuesday. "Therefore, who needs them as they 
are currently constituted? The public needs to get some folks in who are more 
interested in the public business than their own personal survival." 
</P>
<P>
Did his blame apply to Deukmejian as well, he was asked. "It takes two to 
tango," Schabarum said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Capitol, Democrats blame Republicans and the governor, and Republicans 
blame Democrats for a "paralysis of leadership." But opinion surveys, including 
a Los Angeles Times poll last winter, show that citizens don't make such clear 
distinctions and hold the Legislature as an institution in very low regard. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum and Van de Kamp, who made his "Clean Government Initiative" an early 
theme in his campaign for governor, sought to capitalize on what they saw as 
citizen disenchantment with their elected state representatives. 
</P>
<P>
There is now no limit on the number of terms a California state legislator may 
serve; senators are elected to four-year terms and Assembly members to two-year 
terms. The Schabarum plan would limit members of the Assembly to three terms 
and senators to two terms starting with the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Critics maintain that the restricted terms constitute a "lifetime ban" on 
returning to the Assembly or Senate after an incumbent's last term has expired. 
</P>
<P>
One of the critics is Brown, who said he believes the Schabarum measure is 
aimed at him. "I think Republicans genuinely believe that the (Assembly) 
leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle can't be dislodged through the 
normal electoral process. They are trying anything," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The Van de Kamp plan would limit Assembly members to six successive terms and 
senators to three, for a total of 12 years each. After a one-term break in 
service, a former legislator could run again for the Assembly or Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Schabarum initiative, the governor and state superintendent of public 
instruction would be restricted to two four-year terms. Other statewide 
officers, such as lieutenant governor, would be restricted to two terms in the 
same office, but could seek other office. 
</P>
<P>
Another major provision would abolish the legislative retirement program, 
except for previously vested members, and require lawmakers to participate only 
in the federal Social Security retirement, disability and health insurance 
system. 
</P>
<P>
A third feature would hand the Legislature an estimated 38% cut in the amount 
it can spend. Broken down by member, this would reduce the Legislature's budget 
per year from approximately $1.5 million to $950,000.

LIBERAL PARTY PULLS OUT OF E. GERMAN COALITION;

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany's first democratic government teetered on the brink of collapse 
Tuesday, but the quicksilver pace of German unification showed no sign of 
slowing despite the bitter political infighting. 
</P>
<P>
The quarrel over the precise timing of the historic merger reached a crisis 
point after the small Liberal Party faction walked out of Prime Minister Lothar 
de Maiziere's grand coalition, and the country's second-largest party, the 
Social Democrats, threatened to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether East Germany should accede to West Germany on the eve of 
joint national elections scheduled for Dec. 2, or immediately afterward -- a 
technicality that could determine the political tilt of a united German 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
But even as the East Berlin coalition showed signs of unraveling barely 100 
days into De Maiziere's office, discussions between the two Germanys over key 
points of their merger rolled along. 
</P>
<P>
West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters in Bonn that 
final negotiations on a treaty that would outline a single legal and political 
system for united Germany should be complete by the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble said experts from both sides were making "good headway" in laying the 
ground for an Aug. 1 meeting of German unity committees from the East and West 
German parliaments. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on condition of anonymity, an East German government spokesman said 
Tuesday night that there is no chance "at all" that the political storm in East 
Berlin might slow the reunification process, because all parties are committed 
to the goal. 
</P>
<P>
The two German states have already merged their economic, social and monetary 
systems. After the second treaty uniting political and legal systems is ironed 
out, joint elections are all that is needed to seal the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing a capital remains one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the 
political-legal treaty, according to Schaeuble. East Germany has declared a 
preference for Berlin, but critics argue that the city's Third Reich World War 
II history plus the staggering cost of uprooting the West German federal 
government make staying in Bonn a more practical choice. 
</P>
<P>
A weary-looking De Maiziere told reporters late Tuesday that the strife in East 
Berlin amounts to nothing more than "tactical election maneuvering" by his 
worried rivals. But he nonetheless scheduled emergency talks with vacationing 
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Both men are Christian Democrats, and Kohl is considered the front-runner to 
become the first leader of a united Germany after 45 years of bitter division. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Liberal resignation still left De Maiziere with a clear governing 
majority in the 400-seat Volkskammer, loss of the Social Democrats' 88 seats 
would leave him two votes short of a mandate. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, a concert violist and human rights lawyer holding his first public 
office, could then either attempt to form a new government or try to govern 
with a minority. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberals issued a statement in East Berlin sharply criticizing De 
Maiziere's "unyielding stand on the issue of accession and voting procedures." 
</P>
<P>
The Liberals and Social Democrats want East Germany to legally dissolve itself 
and accede to West Germany on Dec. 1, one day before the federal elections. 
Such a move would mean adhering to West German electoral laws, which require a 
party to win at least 5% of the popular vote to claim seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
That 5% rule would effectively block smaller East German political parties, 
including those who mounted last fall's peaceful anti-Communist revolution, 
from winning seats in the all-German Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere and some smaller East German parties insist that the Dec. 2 
balloting be divided among East and West districts, which would permit East 
Germany's estimated 12 million voters to apply their own, more liberal election 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany would then immediately accede to West Germany, effectively dodging 
the 5% rule in a move that De Maiziere acknowledges favors his own Christian 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
He denied accusations by opponents that his stance was choreographed behind the 
scenes by Kohl's own Christian Democrats to ensure that Kohl would keep his 
lead in the election race. 
</P>
<P>
"Any speculation that Bonn plays a special role is absolutely unacceptable," De 
Maiziere said Tuesday night in an interview on West German television. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democrats won more than 40% of the popular vote last March 18, 
when 93% of eligible East Germans cast ballots in the country's first free, 
democratic election. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the smaller parties lined up with De Maiziere on this complicated yet 
crucial issue ironically include the discredited Communists -- an embarrassment 
De Maiziere has attempted to shrug off by asserting, "We didn't vote with them; 
they voted with us." 
</P>
<P>
The Liberals pounced on the strange conservative-Communist alliance as "a 
startling pact" that "is unbearable for us." 
</P>
<P>
But De Maiziere said Tuesday's bailout "just goes to show that you can't rely 
on Liberals. They collapse when faced with a problem such as this. Well, if 
it's too heavy for them, we'll just have to carry it alone.

PICKING GRAPES, AND LIFE, IN THE WEST; 
</P>
<P>
FRANCE: A BRIEF ARTICLE ON VINTNERS' NEED FOR HARVEST HELP DRAWS A FLOOD OF 
RESPONSES FROM STRAPPED POLES AND CZECHOSLOVAKS.

<P>
The "Grapes of Wrath" has come to the new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The promise of the good life amid bountiful fresh fruit that attracted the 
great migration of Dust Bowl residents to California appears to have had a 
similar effect on financially strapped Eastern Europeans who dream of a better 
life in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
A small article published recently in Polish and Czechoslovak newspapers only 
briefly mentioned the possibility of temporary jobs picking grapes in France 
during the upcoming fall harvest. Response to the article, however, has left 
French wine chateaux and grape growers associations flooded with unprecedented 
requests for employment from Eastern Europeans, many of whom are free for the 
first time to travel in the West. 
</P>
<P>
One association alone, the Conseil des Vins du Medoc, announced Tuesday that it 
has received more than 10,000 letters in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still getting about 50 to 60 letters a day," said the Medoc association 
deputy director, Claudine Izabelle. "Most of them say they would like a job to 
earn some money, because in their country they can't make enough to live." 
</P>
<P>
The massive appeal for work at grape picker wages of $30 a day reflects the 
economic imbalance of a changing Europe in the first year after travel 
restrictions were lifted in most of the former East Bloc. The 15-day grape 
harvest, called les vendanges in France, is expected to begin in late August 
for white grapes and early September for red grapes. 
</P>
<P>
One man, 28-year-old Krzysztof Korycki, wrote that he works 70 hours a week as 
a teacher and photographer in his native Poland but can still only afford basic 
necessities for himself and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a young household, starting at zero," Korycki wrote in a letter typical 
of the poignant requests for help. "We have no chance to buy an apartment, 
furniture, refrigerator or television. . . . I don't know how to live. I dare 
to hope for a favorable response from you." 
</P>
<P>
Another writer, Roman Gregus of Czechoslovakia, said: "We are not afraid of 
hard work under high temperatures. We are not afraid of blisters on our hands." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the letters requested work for large groups of the newly liberated 
Easterners. "The new political situation in Czechoslovakia permits all citizens 
to travel anywhere," wrote Andrej Zboran. "We are 14 men and 11 women looking 
for seasonal work from August to October." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the letters detailed personal financial difficulty at home. Bogustaw 
Hoscilo, 22, described himself as a Polish karate champion and "Red Beret" 
parachutist in the Polish army who needs money to help support his widowed 
mother living on the family farm. 
</P>
<P>
But some related a desire simply to enjoy the new freedom of travel and earn a 
little money on the side. 
</P>
<P>
"We come from countries where only the big masters had the possibility of 
travel," noted one such writer. "But the great changes at the end of last year 
have made it possible to satisfy this natural desire to travel for each man. 
One of our desires is to be able to work in sunny France." 
</P>
<P>
Although moved by the plaintive appeals of the Eastern Europeans, French wine 
producers say there is little they can do to help them. Grape picking is now 
highly mechanized, and preferences for employment must be given first to 
residents of the 12-nation Economic Community. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the chateaux employ only 20 to 40 people for the handpicking. Even the 
bigger ones, such as Mouton-Rothschild, seldom hire more than 100 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring workers from outside the Common Market is often a nightmare of 
bureaucracy. According to a spokesman from the French Ministry of Employment, 
chateaux owners who hire Poles for work in their fields are required to pay 660 
francs (about $120) to the government if the employment lasts less than two 
months. In addition, they are required to pay the cost of return transportation 
to the border. The fees make the short-term employment not very attractive for 
the producer. 
</P>
<P>
Some chateaux owners, however, say they will bend the rules to hire at least a 
few of the Easterners. The owner of the Chateau d'Arsac, whose grandmother was 
Czech, has promised to hire some of the Czechoslovaks. 
</P>
<P>
Others remained cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"I got 30 letters from Czechoslovakia," said Paul Haustin, owner of the small 
Chateau Peyrond Lagravette in the Medoc region of Bordeaux. "It is the first 
time I've ever received a letter from the Eastern countries. I hope to employ a 
few, but I have to wait for the directives of the government."

BY END OF THE YEAR, A NEW SOVIET UNION?; 
</P>
<P>
REFORM: TOP-HEAVY COMMUNIST RULE WOULD END IN AN EFFORT TO PLACATE 
INDEPENDENCE-MINDED LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

<P>
Faced with ethnic violence in the Soviet south and secession in the north, 
Soviet leaders may formally agree by the end of this year to dismantle their 
country as it now exists to found a new union with far greater powers for 
independence-minded local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In a monumental reversal of traditionally top-heavy Communist rule and of 
centuries of relentless Russian centralization begun by the czars, the 
leadership of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is envisaging "a new union of 
independent states" to keep the Soviet Union together as separatist pressures 
grow, top adviser Grigory I. Revenko said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiating a new "union treaty" to replace the nearly 68-year-old agreement 
that created the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is now "the No. 1 priority 
for us," the member of the Presidential Council, or Gorbachev's personal 
cabinet, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Revenko predicted that a draft of the document putting an official end to the 
ability of the Moscow-based central government to decide virtually any issue 
anywhere in the world's largest country could be agreed upon by December. 
</P>
<P>
However, spokesmen for nationalist groups and governments in the Baltic and 
Transcaucasian states said the plan for a new treaty will not sway them from 
their goal of complete independence, and they said it cannot prevent the Soviet 
Union from fracturing. The treaty was discussed in detail Friday by the 
Presidential Council and the Federal Council, a body of representatives from 
the 15 Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, the treaty is belated and is none of our concern," said Raul Myalk, 
press attache of the Estonian Supreme Soviet, or legislature, which in March 
voted to pursue a step-by-step approach to restoring the independence lost 50 
years ago when the Baltic state was annexed by the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Revenko and another participant in Friday's meeting also reported that 
Gorbachev outlined eight areas -- including defense, the KGB, foreign affairs 
and foreign trade -- that would remain within the purview of the central 
government, a provision that directly challenges the claims of sovereignty made 
by some of the republics. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the treaty as outlined by Revenko, an erstwhile Ukrainian 
Communist Party official, would be far more flexible than the country's present 
political structure. Under that structure, tiny Armenia in theory has the same 
rights and obligations as the behemoth Russian Federation because both are 
Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
In the new union, "every republic should decide which powers it wishes to 
delegate to the union as a whole," Revenko said. 
</P>
<P>
Some may opt for a planned "special status" or "associated status," he noted, 
which would allow them to remain part of the Soviet Union while having fewer 
obligations to it than other republics. 
</P>
<P>
"The Baltic republics do not oppose having close social and economic ties with 
the union," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Told of Revenko's comments, Jozef Dumyalis, a member of the governing council 
of Lithuania's grass-roots pro-independence movement Sajudis, replied: "We have 
been part of the Soviet Union for the last 50 years, and we know what that 
means, while we know nothing yet about the so-called union treaty. In other 
words, we are not going to stay in the union or take part in this project." 
</P>
<P>
According to the outline offered by Revenko, the new union would be strictly 
voluntary, unlike the 1922 agreement under which non-Russian republics from the 
Ukraine to Central Asia were virtually welded onto the administrative structure 
of Bolshevik-ruled Russia. 
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to the forcible inclusion of anyone in the union," Revenko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he insisted on the importance of "wholeness," suggesting that the 
Soviet leadership would push, presumably hard, for all 15 republics to join. 
</P>
<P>
In yet another rejection of orthodoxy and sign of the Kremlin's growing 
willingness to be flexible, Revenko said he believed that even if a republic 
declared itself non-socialist, it ought to be able to remain a part of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought today to give up abstract arguments about ideas; we should think 
about the state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that dramatic de-emphasis of ideology, which would have been hard to 
imagine even six months ago, Revenko said no thought had yet been given to 
changing the country's name from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. But 
he did not rule out a name change. 
</P>
<P>
According to Revenko, August and September should be devoted to working out 
"general principles" on the union treaty and the country's transition to a 
market-style economy, two reforms Gorbachev has said are inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
"Documents will be compiled for a treaty in October and November, and in 
December this could go to a first reading," Revenko said. "But this could drag 
itself out for a few months into the new year." 
</P>
<P>
The new treaty, he said, will be discussed by the legislatures of the various 
Soviet republics and, if necessary, put to a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Implicit in Revenko's comments was the assumption that republics not opting for 
membership in the reformed union would be free to seek independence, perhaps 
under more advantageous terms than those laid this year by the Soviet 
Parliament, which fixed a five-year "cooling-off" period before secession can 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
Latvia's representative at Friday's closed-door meeting, Andrejs Krastons, the 
deputy chairman of the Parliament, reported that Gorbachev outlined eight key 
policy spheres to be controlled by the central government, including: 
</P>
<P>
Defense, borders and the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign policy, foreign trade and customs. 
</P>
<P>
Personal and legal rights and the creation of a national institution to prevent 
ethnic conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Coordination of market relations, unified monetary policy, prices and 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Guarantees of energy supplies for all republics. 
</P>
<P>
Coordination of transport. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental regulation and emergency assistance in the event of natural 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
Guarantees for scientific and technical progress. 
</P>
<P>
Basically confirming that list, Revenko said the central government would be 
responsible for "the free movement of peoples, goods and, I might say, ideas." 
</P>
<P>
As Gorbachev's reforms allow many of the country's more than 100 ethnic groups 
to voice grievances they long held silent, eight Soviet republics have served 
notice that they want a new deal by asserting their right to self-rule or 
independence in varying degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The latest was the Ukraine, whose Parliament last week issued a bold 
declaration of sovereignty, saying it plans to establish the second-largest 
Soviet republic as a neutral state and assume the right to create its own 
security forces and coin money. 
</P>
<P>
Nationalist fervor and revolt against Moscow's rule have ranged from the 
Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan, which declared last month that its laws 
were supreme and claimed the right to decide all issues of domestic and foreign 
policy, to Lithuania, which proclaimed independence in March. 
</P>
<P>
Potentially the most alarming step toward home rule came when the huge Russian 
Federation, the biggest and most populous of the Soviet republics, declared 
itself sovereign last month under the urging of its populist president, Boris 
N. Yeltsin, and ruled that Russian laws would now take priority on its 
territory.

WIDEN PIERCE INQUIRY, PANEL URGES PROSECUTOR

A House panel on Tuesday urged a special prosecutor to widen the investigation 
of former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., saying it had evidence that 
Pierce steered federal grants to his former law firm. 
</P>
<P>
In their most detailed finding, congressional investigators questioned whether 
Pierce's former law firm, a former top aide and Pierce himself may have 
violated federal bribery, conspiracy and conflict-of-interest laws during his 
tenure as secretary of housing and urban development. 
</P>
<P>
The panel said evidence suggested also that Pierce, who served throughout the 
eight-year Ronald Reagan Administration, may have committed perjury at a panel 
hearing when he denied involvement in the awarding of key grants. 
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that Secretary Pierce did not give us the full story," the panel 
wrote. "However, some of his statements stand out in that they are inconsistent 
and at odds with the sworn testimony of other witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce testified in the early stages of the investigation, then invoked his 5th 
Amendment right against self-incrimination in refusing to submit to additional 
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
In urging independent counsel Arlin Adams to substantially expand his 
investigation, the House Government Operations subcommittee said its 14-month 
investigation uncovered "widespread abuses, influence peddling, blatant 
favoritism, monumental waste and gross mismanagement" at HUD during Pierce's 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Its findings were offered in a letter signed by all eight subcommittee members 
-- three Republicans and five Democrats, including Chairman Tom Lantos (D-San 
Mateo). 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's lawyer, Paul L. Perito, said there was "nothing new, different or 
worthy of attention" in the letter. He said it was "improper and inappropriate" 
for the committee to direct a letter to the prosecutor rather than the Justice 
Department.

SINGLE IMMIGRATION AGENCY URGED; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: A PANEL FORMED BY CONGRESS SAYS A TOP-LEVEL UNIT IS NEEDED TO 
CENTRALIZE FUNCTIONS NOW WIDELY DISPERSED.

A top-level agency is needed to bring leadership and order to the chaos created 
by several federal agencies involved in the nation's immigration and refugee 
policies, a congressional commission said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Immigration policy requires constant study and attention at a senior level of 
government," said the report by the Commission for the Study of International 
Migration and Cooperative Economic Development, a 12-member, bipartisan group 
formed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The goal "can best be achieved by centralizing the current widely dispersed 
government structure for handling immigration and refugee affairs in a single 
agency whose head reports directly to the President," the report continued. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), two 
lawmakers intimately involved in immigration legislation, said the creation of 
a new central agency was an idea worth pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
Neither, however, rushed to join Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who introduced 
a bill to create the Agency for Migration Affairs, as suggested in the report. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's bill would consolidate all the functions of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service except the U.S. Border Patrol with the Consular, Refugee 
and Human Rights and the Humanitarian Affairs bureaus of the State Department. 
It would also create a commissioner for migration affairs, who would be 
appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, consuls at the State Department issue visas in other countries for 
entry into the United States. The INS, an arm of the Justice Department, has 
authority over immigrants after they arrive in the country, including the 
authority to issue work-authorizing green cards. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a new, top-level agency, headed by a commissioner reporting directly 
to the President, with centralized responsibilities currently being handled -- 
or mishandled -- by five government agencies or bureaus," Cranston said during 
a news conference unveiling the commission's report. 
</P>
<P>
Diego C. Asencio, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state and commission 
director, seemed surprised that Cranston took the recommendation seriously 
enough to offer a bill on the day of the report's release. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the legislation "provocative," Asencio said the commission suggested 
the creation of a new agency as a means to "start the debate" on the nation's 
disjointed immigration oversight. "Other possibilities are out there to get to 
the same point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At an earlier hearing before the House Foreign Relations Committee, Asencio 
said the commission found that job creation in Mexico and other countries 
offers the best solution to stopping the flow of illegal immigrants into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Promoting economic development is the proper way to proceed if we are serious 
about stemming unauthorized migration in this hemisphere over the long term, 
and I must emphasize that we are talking about a process that will probably 
take decades," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, established by Congress in 1986 as a part of the Immigration 
Reform and Control Act, also suggested: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pushing for a free trade agreement with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Supporting increased trade with other Western Hemisphere countries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Allowing Mexico and Caribbean countries to make and ship to the United 
States the cloth, clothes and steel that currently comes from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increasing sugar imports from Caribbean nations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Requiring major decisions on aid and trade with other countries to feature 
an "impact statement" detailing the effect the decision would have on 
international migration.

POST OFFICE BRACES AS STRIKE AT UNITED PARCEL IS FEARED; 
</P>
<P>
MAIL: OFFICIALS SAY THE SYSTEM CANNOT ASSUME THE WHOLE UPS LOAD. A CONTINGENCY 
PLAN WOULD LIMIT PACKAGES SHIPPED.

<P>
The U.S. Postal Service, bracing for a potential strike at United Parcel 
Service, Tuesday announced contingency plans that officials hope will avoid 
disruption of first class mail if a truckers' union walks out after expiration 
of its contracts next week. 
</P>
<P>
The plan assumes disruption for large shippers and is designed to limit the 
number of parcels individual mailers can drop off each time they visit a post 
office. In addition, the Postal Service said that it will deliver some packages 
only if they are first somehow shipped to a post office within the recipient's 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the service said, there could be delays in its second-day mail 
delivery service, perhaps by a day or more. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service announcement followed the release of a letter from UPS 
officials to more than 1 million of its regular customers, warning them of 
possible service disruptions after July 31 should the International Brotherhood 
of Teamsters reject the UPS contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
Voting on the contract is under way and a count is expected next week, said a 
Teamster official, who added that the union leadership opposes the contract 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
UPS said that packages scheduled for delivery after July 31 "could, in the 
event of a work stoppage, be subject to a considerable delay." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Coughlin, deputy postmaster general, said that the Postal Service is 
worried that its regular mail service could become paralyzed if a Teamsters' 
strike dumps UPS' daily packages on the nation's post offices. Even with the 
advance plans, "there's no way the Post Office can absorb UPS' operations," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
UPS currently handles 10 million packages daily -- 20 times more than the 
500,000 packages delivered daily by the Postal Service. UPS also delivers 
300,000 overnight packages, a third more than the government service. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service, however, continues to hold a 3-1 lead in two-day delivery 
parcels. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Post Office's contingency plan, shippers with five or more packages 
would have to call a toll-free, 800 number to find the post office within the 
ZIP code area where the deliveries are to be made. For example, if a mail-order 
company wanted to send a dozen packages from its warehouse in Maine to 
customers in Southern California, the company is likely to be told that it must 
arrange to leave the packages at a designated post office within the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility of getting the parcel to the (designated post office) 
location is the shipper's responsibility," Coughlin said, adding that postal 
officials will meet today with trucking companies and other freight forwarding 
firms to coordinate their plan with their operations. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials, who are monitoring the volume of packages coming from large 
shippers, said that they would decide by Friday whether to institute the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Parcels in groups of four or less would continue to be accepted, as usual, at 
any post office. Similarly, there would be no restriction placed on paid 
overnight or first-class mail delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"These rules will not affect the American consumer or small businesses which 
mail two or three packages a day," said Azeezaly S. Jaffer, a Postal Service 
spokesman. "The real focus is on the big shipper." 
</P>
<P>
Teamsters struck UPS operations in 15 states in 1977, a company official said, 
noting that the shipping firm's national operations have never been curtailed 
by labor problems.

Jury selection was scheduled this morning in the U.S. District Court trial of 
the former pilots, accused of being drunk while flying a commercial airliner 
from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis on March 8. The Boeing 727, with 91 passengers 
aboard, landed safely at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The three

VERTIGO, NOT MADNESS, MAY HAVE TORMENTED VAN GOGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vincent van Gogh, whose artistic brilliance and supposed madness have made him 
a focus of popular fascination, suffered not from epilepsy or insanity but from 
an inner-ear disorder that causes vertigo and ringing ears, a new analysis of 
his letters suggests. 
</P>
<P>
The authors of the study, reported today in the Journal of the American Medical 
Assn., suggest that the 19th-Century Dutch painter suffered from Meniere's 
disease, a condition that was little known at the time and has often been 
misdiagnosed as epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
"Van Gogh's handwritten statements describing his attacks and his illness are 
compelling evidence for a diagnosis of Meniere's disease and not epilepsy," the 
authors concluded. They said his behavior "should forever banish the notion 
that he was an epileptic or 'mad.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Meniere's disease theory, put forward by specialists at the International 
Meniere's Disease Research Institute and others, is the latest in a series of 
explanations offered for Van Gogh's erratic behavior, including his suicide at 
age 37 and a now-famous incident in which he sliced off one of his ears. 
</P>
<P>
Other explanations have included epilepsy, dementia, schizophrenia, manic 
depression and sunstroke. Two years ago, a Kansas biochemist announced that he 
believed that Van Gogh's problems stemmed at least in part from addiction to a 
liqueur, absinthe. 
</P>
<P>
The latest hypothesis surfaced in 1979 when a Japanese ear specialist published 
a paper linking Van Gogh to Meniere's disease, a condition caused by an 
increase in the amount of fluid in the canals of the inner ear that control a 
person's balance. 
</P>
<P>
The main symptom of Meniere's disease is a sudden attack of vertigo, often so 
severe that the person collapses. The dizziness can be accompanied by nausea, 
vomiting and jerky eye movement, as well as deafness, ringing and a feeling of 
acute pressure in the affected ear. 
</P>
<P>
The disease is believed to affect about 7 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
In the new paper, the authors contend that a diagnosis of Meniere's disease 
could account for the symptoms Van Gogh described in his voluminous 
correspondence -- letters that the researchers describe as "an untapped 
retrospective clinical history of his illness." 
</P>
<P>
For example, the researchers found that Van Gogh described in letters written 
between 1884 and 1890 disabling attacks of what he called "vertige." Those 
bouts were accompanied by nausea, vomiting and noise intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
As with Meniere's disease, the bouts were separated by symptom-free periods 
lasting for months. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Van Gogh appears to have heard strange sounds in his ear -- perhaps 
the ringing, or tinnitus, that is a symptom of the disease. The researchers 
quote a physician who treated Van Gogh and reported that the painter was 
"assailed by auditory hallucinations." 
</P>
<P>
While one psychologist has suggested that Van Gogh cut off his ear in 
frustration with those noises, the authors of the new paper would not go that 
far. They did, however, note that Meniere's disease sufferers have reported an 
urge to cut off or poke a hole in their ear. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the researchers contend that patients with chronic, recurring vertigo 
and dizziness "can develop severe secondary psychological problems, including 
bizarre behavior." Patients often become despondent, like Van Gogh, after being 
told they cannot be cured.

AMPHITHEATER LOSES NOISE, MERGER BATTLES

<P>
The Pacific Amphitheatre's operators were beaten on two key fronts Tuesday in 
their efforts to stave off noise restrictions and to eliminate profit-sapping 
competition with the rival Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court judge imposed new noise limitations on the 
18,765-capacity rock and pop concert facility on the same day that Pacific 
officials learned that they had lost their bid to acquire a controlling 
interest in their longtime competitor. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a U.S. Justice Department suit filed last week to stop a merger 
between the two amphitheaters, the consortium of private investors who own 
Irvine Meadows accepted a rival offer that will keep it out of Pacific's 
control. Robert Geddes, a minority shareholder in the 15,000-capacity Irvine 
facility, has teamed with Irving Azoff, a veteran record industry executive, to 
buy "a substantial interest" in Irvine Meadows. As a result, competition will 
continue. The deal is expected to put an end to the government's antitrust 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Amphitheatre is owned by the East Coast-based Nederlander 
Organization, which had hoped by merging with Irvine Meadows to solve both 
problems. If the merger had gone through, Nederlander could have shunted louder 
acts to the more remote Irvine Meadows and offered the Pacific's Costa Mesa 
neighbors softer pop shows. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a merger would have ended fierce bidding wars for top pop and 
rock concert attractions that Pacific officials blamed for driving up the cost 
of business and for losses that they said totaled more than $2 million in 1989. 
According to documents filed in the Justice Department suit, combined revenues 
at the two facilities are between $13 million and $20 million annually. Each 
amphitheater has presented between 35 and 55 concerts a year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new noise ruling, Superior Court Judge Richard J. Beacom ordered 
Pacific officials to keep sound levels within five decibels of the county's 
sliding-scale noise ordinance. Noise from the amphitheater will not exceed 55 
decibels for more than 30 minutes, nor be louder than 75 decibels at any time, 
the judge's order states. 
</P>
<P>
Because there was only one plaintiff in the noise complaint, Costa Mesa 
resident Laurie Lusk, noise levels will be measured from Lusk's property. 
</P>
<P>
Ending a two-week trial, Beacom said the noise from concerts at the 
amphitheater had exceeded 55 decibels for more than half-hour periods for 
years. He said he believes that such noise levels constitute a nuisance to the 
Lusk family members and that they deserved relief. 
</P>
<P>
Beacom's ruling brought Lusk to tears. She had waged the legal fight against 
the amphitheater with financial backing from about 300 of her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it," Lusk said. "I can't believe it's over." When asked if the 
long court fight was worth it, Lusk said: "Every minute of it." 
</P>
<P>
But the ruling may not be the end of the issue. In the past, Nederlander 
officials have had noise restrictions against them overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific attorney Deborah M. Nesset said she would have to consult with 
Nederlander officials, but she did not rule out the possibility of an appeal of 
Tuesday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The judge assigned the county marshal's office to monitor the sound from a 
point near the Lusks' property -- or hire someone to do it -- and to report any 
violations. Violations would be punishable by contempt-of-court citations. At 
another hearing Nov. 30, the marshals will report on the amphitheater's 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander officials have contended that noise limits would cause top rock 
attractions to bypass the Pacific, crippling its efforts to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the entrance of music industry magnate Irving Azoff as a new Irvine 
Meadows partner snuffs out the last chance for a merger with the Pacific 
Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Azoff, former chairman of MCA's Music Entertainment Group, joins Donald Koll, 
one of Orange County's leading developers, and Robert Geddes in a new business 
troika that will control the amphitheater. In accepting a joint bid by Geddes 
and Azoff to acquire what a press release announcing the deal termed a 
"substantial interest" in Irvine Meadows, Koll, who had held a majority 
interest in Irvine Meadows, rejected a rival bid by the Pacific Amphitheatre's 
owners to merge the two facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department stepped in last Thursday to block the merger proposal, 
filing an antitrust suit that contended joint operation would create an illegal 
monopoly in the Orange County concert market. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hegness, an attorney for Koll, said Tuesday that the government's 
antitrust filing played a part in determining the outcome as two suitors vied 
to strike a deal with Koll over Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander, in its bid, had teamed with Ogden Allied Services Corp., which 
operates arenas and entertainment concessions around the country. After that 
offer surfaced in March, Geddes and Azoff parried with a counter-bid of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department action "really put us in the position where in order to 
go forward with the Nederlander transaction, we had to step up to a fight with 
the government," Hegness said. "All of us had reservations about that. It's 
real time-consuming and very expensive. We felt it was a fight better avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't view (the Azoff-Geddes offer) as a second choice at all," Hegness 
added. Geddes, a concert industry veteran and former National Football League 
linebacker, and Azoff, who recently launched his own entertainment company and 
record label, Giant Records, will jointly oversee day-to-day operations at 
Irvine Meadows, Hegness said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Nederlander-Ogden merger proposal, Irvine Meadow's owners would have 
sold a 75% interest for $8 million but would have gained a 25% share in the 
Pacific in return. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Meadows principals would not release any details about how much 
money Geddes and Azoff paid for their new stake in the amphitheater, nor would 
they reveal what percentage each partner now holds. According to documents in 
the Justice Department suit, Geddes held a 25% share. Hegness said he retains a 
small percentage of Irvine Meadows, but that another minority shareholder, 
business consultant Larry Hoffman, was bought out as part of the deal, which 
was completed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"With Irving and Bob at the helm, I anticipate many more years of successful 
operation at Irvine and look forward to working with both of them," Koll said 
in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Papiano, a partner in the Pacific Amphitheatre, expressed surprise Tuesday 
when told of the Irvine Meadows deal. Papiano, who also is Pacific's lawyer, 
said he had been planning to fight the Justice Department's antitrust case in 
court in hopes of eventually winning the case and completing the proposed 
Irvine-Pacific merger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complete surprise to me," said Papiano, who was reached while on a trip 
to San Francisco. "As of (Monday), the Koll lawyers were working on (fighting) 
the (antitrust) case. I thought we had reached an agreement in principle" to 
merge, subject to the antitrust suit's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher S. Crook, assistant chief of the Justice Department's antitrust 
division in San Francisco, said that "we're going to have to find out exactly 
what transpired," but that with the merger derailed, the government may "put to 
rest" its antitrust suit. 
</P>
<P>
Geddes, who has been overseeing Irvine Meadows' operations as managing partner, 
said that little will change outwardly at the amphitheater, and that the 
competition with Pacific will go on as before. Avalon Attractions, the 
independent concert promoter in which Geddes owns a 50% share, will continue to 
book and promote Irvine Meadows' shows. However, Geddes said, "having Azoff on 
our side obviously strengthens our position. He is definitely an important 
player, who didn't become what he is without being involved on every level in 
the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Azoff's contacts in the music business could help Irvine Meadows land some 
shows it otherwise might not have been able to promote, Geddes said. 
</P>
<P>
Azoff first became a major figure in the pop music business in the 1970s as 
manager of the Eagles, Steely Dan, and other acts. He left his post at MCA last 
year to launch Giant Records, with financial backing from the huge Warner 
Brothers label. Azoff and Geddes had previously been partners in a vending 
company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quiet Decision 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of Judge Richard J. Beacom's order, noise from the Pacific 
Amphitheatre may not exceed: 
</P>
<P>
55 decibels for more than 30 minutes; 
</P>
<P>
60 decibels for 15 minutes; 
</P>
<P>
65 decibels for 4 minutes; 
</P>
<P>
70 decibels for 1 minute; 
</P>
<P>
75 decibels -- ever. 
</P>
<P>
Sound levels are to be measured at the home of plaintiff Laurie Lusk and 
monitored by the county marshal's office.

The ultimate upper-crust loaf has gone on sale in England, an organic bread 
named after Prince Charles' Highgrove estate and containing wheat organically 
grown at his home farm. 
</P>
<P>
The Tesco supermarket chain began selling Wholemeal Highgrove for $1.07 a loaf 
on Tuesday as part of a 12-week trial at 23 stores in southeast England. 
</P>
<P>
The bread is made from wheat grown without pesticides at Charles' Home Farm at 
Highgrove, 100 miles west of London, as well as with Canadian organic wheat. 
</P>
<P>
Charles agreed to the product to promote organic farming. Last year, he 
denounced what he called the excessive use of chemicals in modern agriculture, 
and in 1985, he partly converted Home Farm to organic methods.

CUOMO SIGNS BILL TO BAN DWARF TOSSING

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed legislation Tuesday banning dwarf tossing and dwarf 
bowling in New York bars, calling the activities a "strange diversion." 
</P>
<P>
"Any activity which dehumanizes and humiliates these people is degrading to us 
all," Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill recognizes that and, in effect, declares these bizarre games to be 
debased." 
</P>
<P>
The bill, similar to one that became law in Florida last year, amounts to a ban 
because the events have not been popular outside bars. It passed the 
Legislature with only one dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
The law targets taverns, but has no penalties for participants. Bars could 
loose their liquor licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Dwarf tossing is a competition in which people pick up dwarfs, who are wearing 
harnesses, and heave them as far as possible at a padded target. It produced an 
offshoot, dwarf bowling, in which a helmeted dwarf is strapped to a skateboard 
and rolled into bowling pins. Both have been held as competitions for cash 
prizes, Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dwarf tossing belongs in the Middle Ages, not the modern age," said state Sen. 
Nicholas Spano, who sponsored the bill.

The offer includes a total of $127 million in loans to the NFL team to renovate 
and expand the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum and to finance the move from Los 
Angeles. The Raiders have 45 days to accept the offer or it will lapse. Team 
owner Al Davis and other team officials have made no commitment to either 
Oakland or Los Angeles as talks continue with both cities.

MAN GIVEN 10 YEARS FOR BOMB THREATS

A loner who called in more than 300 false bomb threats to airlines was 
sentenced to 10 years in prison by a San Diego federal judge who said there is 
no room for leniency when it comes to disruptive threats to the nation's air 
transit system. William A. Risley, who had been jobless, collecting welfare and 
living in a $15-a-night downtown San Diego hotel when arrested last year, had 
asked U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving for a two-year term, saying he 
made the threats to distract himself from his feelings of hopelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Irving flatly rejected Risley's plea for mercy. The judge said he viewed the 
threats -- called in over a nine-year period from public phones in San Diego, 
San Francisco, Detroit and Washington -- as "extremely serious antisocial 
conduct" that "caused havoc in nationwide air travel." Officials believe Risley 
cost the airline industry more than $1 million as frantic pilots returned to 
airports and inspections were conducted on runways.

In a possibly precedent-setting ruling, Mendocino County Superior Court Judge 
James Luther issued a temporary restraining order barring Louisiana-Pacific 
Corp. from logging 110 acres of old-growth forest targeted by "Redwood Summer" 
protesters. The ruling appeared to be the first under new state emergency 
regulations that stops logging that threatens the northern spotted owl. 
Louisiana-Pacific spokesman Shep Tucker said he expects "some precedent" to be 
set in the lawsuit, filed by environmentalists as part of a campaign to stop 
the lumber company from logging in the Navarro Ridge area, 10 miles south of 
Mendocino.

LAWYER BAILS OUT, REFUSING TO GRILL WIFE IN 'GIGOLO' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
First, he lost his Rolls-Royce and his freedom. Then, he lost his new wife, who 
was supposed to help protect him from the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
And on Tuesday, Joseph (Mac) Duffy, the self-described "gigolo" whose wily ways 
with women and their money have been chronicled on "A Current Affair," even 
lost his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Jerry Steering declared a conflict of interest and, under 
prodding from a judge, took himself off the already-prolonged case, delaying it 
at least through next month. A second preliminary hearing for Duffy, 29, on 
charges that he bilked four local women out of tens of thousands of dollars 
through false promises, was to have begun Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Steering told the court that he has become too close to Duffy's estranged wife 
-- Sylvianne Lestringant, 42, of Laguna Niguel -- to adequately cross-examine 
Duffy's one-time supporter. 
</P>
<P>
Lestringant first asserted last year that Duffy had conned her out of $17,500 
by wooing her with his expensive habits, then falsely claiming that he was a 
stockbroker. In love, she married him anyway, in an unsuccessful bid to help 
his case and avoid testifying against him. 
</P>
<P>
But now she has filed for an annulment and reclaimed the bail she posted for 
Duffy because she is convinced that there's no chance of changing his ways. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining his legal conflict, Steering said in an interview: "I'm friends with 
(Lestringant). I've learned many things about their relationship and about 
things that might ultimately affect the case, and I'm not going to go after her 
on the stand. I just can't bring myself to belittle her and impugn her 
character and further humiliate her." 
</P>
<P>
Steering disclosed in court that Lestringant, before deciding that she wanted 
to call it quits with Duffy, had paid his defense costs. That posed yet another 
potential conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Municipal Judge Susanne S. Shaw in Newport Beach was not pleased with 
the turn of events that slowed the court proceedings, and she let Steering know 
it. 
</P>
<P>
She criticized the attorney's "attitude," told him that he was getting himself 
in "deeper and deeper" trouble and finally suggested that "the only smart thing 
for you to do would be to get off the case." 
</P>
<P>
Steering complied. 
</P>
<P>
With Steering gone, Shaw appointed a public defender to represent Duffy against 
the grand-theft charges and rescheduled his preliminary hearing for Aug. 7 in 
her courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the second such hearing for Duffy, whose case has followed a 
circuitous legal route. Several of the counts against him have been dismissed, 
only to be refiled later, and Duffy himself has reversed his own pleas. He is 
now pleading not guilty to grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's delay was disappointing to Lestringant and the three other alleged 
victims who appeared in court expecting to testify against Duffy. They all 
maintain that the blue-eyed golfer from Scotland used his good looks, fancy 
cars, expensive clothes and fast talk to bilk them out of perhaps $60,000 and 
sustain his lavish lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Lestringant, while happy that Steering will not have the chance to 
cross-examine her about private matters that he learned from her, said she 
regrets the further delays. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want this to be over -- I want out," Lestringant said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to help a person, and it didn't work out. I wish him well, but I 
just want him away from me and my family," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs psychological help. He's not a violent man, he's not a bad man, but 
he needs help, and I found out I couldn't provide it."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN ARRAIGNED IN BREAK-IN AT REAGAN'S 
ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man authorities accused of climbing a fence and entering former President 
Ronald Reagan's Bel-Air estate on July 4 has pleaded not guilty in federal 
court to charges of threatening Reagan's life. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Stuart Gordon, 32, is charged with one count of threatening the life of 
an ex-President and faces a maximum of three years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon was ordered Monday to stand trial Sept. 11 before U.S. District Judge 
Edward Rafeedie, and is being held without bail, according to spokeswoman Grace 
Denton of the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities said Reagan and his wife, Nancy, were at their home when 
Gordon scaled a fence and headed for the front door. He was stopped by a Secret 
Service agent before he reached the doorway where Nancy Reagan was standing, 
prosecutors said.

ELECTRIC RATES ARE ON THE RISE AGAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents face an 8% increase in electricity rates next month under a rate 
change requested by the city-owned utility company and approved Tuesday night 
by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The jump follows a 9% increase imposed last October. 
</P>
<P>
Before then, rates had been stable since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Even after this increase, our rates will still be lower than Edison," said 
Darrell Ament, acting general manager of the Public Utilities Department. "The 
residential (portion) had to be raised because it was paying a lesser share 
(than commercial customers)." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents cited the $10-million settlement the city won from Edison 
earlier this year as a reason rates should not be increased. 
</P>
<P>
But the council said the utility's expenses -- including rising labor and 
energy costs -- justify the increase. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate thing, but it's one of those things that has to be done," 
said Councilman William D. Ehrle. 
</P>
<P>
The new residential rate will increase the average homeowner's bill to about 
$46 a month, about 14% lower than what Southern California Edison Co. charges, 
said Terry Kerr, an area manager for the utility. 
</P>
<P>
The residential increase is larger than increases levied on commercial and 
industrial customers. The increases will be 6% for small businesses, 5% for 
larger businesses and 0.7% for industrial customers. LISA MASCARO

Four of Orange County's top 15 revenue-producing companies donated at least $1 
million to charitable causes last year, with the largest amount, $2 million, 
from Fluor. Two companies with a major presence here but headquartered 
elsewhere, Rockwell Defense Electronics (Anaheim) and McDonnell Douglas 
(Huntington Beach), both gave more than $3 million from their Orange County 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the companies declined to provide information regarding their 
contributions and another suspended its donation activity. 
</P>
<P>
The pet project of most corporations is education. They are committed to 
getting students excited about math and sciences and have contributed 
equipment, laboratories and computers as well as sizable checks to local 
primary and secondary schools, with the lion's share going to local 
universities and colleges. 
</P>

Over and above everything else, here are the dollar amounts donated by Orange 
County's top 15 revenue-producing corporations:

11 PICK UP PAPERS FOR COUNCIL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three open City Council seats for November's municipal elections have drawn 
heavy interest, with 11 people taking out candidate papers since the filing 
period opened last week. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates to date include incumbents Norman P. Murray and Victoria C. Jaffe. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this kind of interest is terrific," said Councilman Robert A. Curtis, 
who is not up for reelection. "It's an indication that Mission Viejo residents 
are very interested in their local government and how to improve it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two incumbents, others picking up filing papers include Ray 
Carolin, Sue Withrow, Marilyn MacDougall, Ed Kearns, Sharon Cody, Alan Gallup, 
Joe Lowe and Gary Manley. Mayor Christian W. Keena said he probably will not 
run for council again and has not taken out papers. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Schiesl, who also took out papers last week, apparently changed his mind 
about running and has returned them, members of the city clerk's office said. 
</P>
<P>
The large turnout has been in part attributed to the community anger raised by 
last February's failed attempt to recall Councilman Robert A. Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
The recall effort had the support of all three officials now up for reelection. 
And although it also received $350,000 from a single developer, it failed by 
approximately 70% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis declined on Monday to say if he will be working against the City Council 
incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
However, commenting on the sharp divisiveness that has marked council politics 
since the city's incorporation two years ago, Curtis said the council is 
"fragmented and polarized. We need a cleansing election so voters can determine 
what direction they want the city to go." FRANK MESSINA

ZOO SEEKS ADVICE OF OUTSIDE CONSULTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the Santa Ana Zoo are seeking some outside advice as they look for 
ways to improve the 38-year-old facility. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana City Council last week accepted a grant of $1,400 from the 
Institute of Museum Services, a federal agency based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to hire a consultant for the zoo who will review 
programs and provide some advice on long-range planning and in other areas, 
said zoo director Claudia Collier. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard about this program, and we thought it would be good to have someone 
from the outside take a look at our operation and let us know where we can 
improve," Collier said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the zoo, in the heart of Orange County at Prentice Park, 
added to its displays two bald eagles, which Collier said have been a popular 
attraction. There are also plans to build "Monkey Island," an 
18,000-square-foot open-air exhibit that will feature the colobus monkey. 
Officials hope to break ground on the project by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
About 225,000 people visit the zoo each year. Collier said attendance is up 9% 
from last year.

PLAN ACCEPTED FOR DOWNTOWN PROJECT

<P>
The long-awaited office and commercial project at Garden Grove Boulevard and 
Euclid Street cleared what may be its final hurdle this week, as the City 
Council reviewed and accepted the site plan. 
</P>
<P>
Intended to be a centerpiece of downtown development, the 8.5-acre project will 
include a 5-story office building, seven 1-story office buildings, a restaurant 
and a 1-story commercial building. 
</P>
<P>
The council, acting as the Agency for Community Development, reviewed the plan 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
IDM of Long Beach, which has also built a 5-story office building at the 
northeast corner of that intersection, is the developer for the 
116,000-square-foot project. Construction of the first phase -- the office 
tower and its garage -- is expected to begin in February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase -- including the garden office, retail and restaurant -- 
should break ground in September, 1992, with the entire project completed in 
1993. JIM TORTOLANO

1ST OF LUXURY OCEANFRONT HOTELS OPENS 
</P>

<P>
Workmen on Tuesday were still laboring on the front yard that overlooks the 
Pacific Ocean. And inside, the noise of hammers and saws was still resounding 
throughout the marble halls. 
</P>
<P>
The luxurious Waterfront Hilton Hotel nonetheless officially opened Tuesday, 
amid rave reviews from the tourists who strolled inside the 12-story oceanfront 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
One visitor, Viola Bandel of Redlands, stood virtually transfixed as she was 
facing an indoor waterfall in the brass-and-marble lobby. "We're impressed," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Fred Bandel, said, "I think it's a major addition to Huntington 
Beach, and it's the sort of place I'd like to come to and bring my friends to." 
</P>
<P>
City officials agreed that the hotel is a significant addition to the city. 
They noted that the $55-million building at Pacific Coast Highway and 
Huntington Street is the first major structure to open under the city's 
multimillion-dollar downtown redevelopment program. Three more oceanfront 
hotels are scheduled to be built as part of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's developers, Robert L. Mayer and Stephen Bone, were on hand Tuesday, 
escorting opening-day visitors through the building. 
</P>
<P>
"All 300 rooms have ocean views," Mayer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The architect built this to let everyone see the ocean," Bone added. "This is 
California." 
</P>
<P>
There were only about 30 guests registered for rooms on opening day, but 
Michael Quinn, director of sales and marketing for the hotel, said all 300 
rooms are already booked for this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 67,000 reservations already booked through 1993," Quinn said. "A lot 
of conventions are going to be coming here." 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the other high-rise hotels to be built next to the Waterfront 
Hilton, forming a Miami Beach-like area of luxury oceanfront buildings. Mayer 
said the second one, on land immediately south of the Hilton, will begin 
construction later this year. That hotel will be built on land now occupied by 
the Huntington Beach Inn, a motel that will be razed. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately north of the Hilton, a new complex of restaurants and movie 
theaters called Pierside Pavilion is scheduled to open next month. That 
structure is also part of the redevelopment downtown. 
</P>
<P>
A new municipal pier, to replace the one closed by storm damage since 1988, is 
scheduled to be under construction by September. BILL BILLITER

VOTERS WILL DECIDE OIL-DRILLING LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A measure that would greatly restrict areas of Garden Grove available for oil 
drilling will be placed on the Nov. 6 city election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Monday voted 4 to 1, with Councilman Francis L. Kessler 
dissenting, to let voters decide on the proposed ordinance that would prohibit 
oil drilling or pumping on any site within 600 feet of churches, schools and 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Kessler called the measure "political," adding: "If this goes into effect, I 
believe that (Chevron USA Inc.) would have legal basis for coming back at us 
for excluding them from our city." 
</P>
<P>
Chevron in 1989 sought a permit to drill exploratory wells on a site near the 
intersection of Nelson Street and Garden Grove Boulevard. The council, after a 
lengthy and heated debate, voted 3 to 2 to deny the permit. 
</P>
<P>
While the measure would not ban drilling in the city, it would restrict the 
activity to two areas: the city yard on Newhope Street, south of Trask Avenue, 
and the Central Industrial District in west Garden Grove. Additionally, the 
measure would require a four-fifths majority of the council to approve a 
drilling permit rather than a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman J. Tilman Williams urged the council to put the measure on the 
ballot. "We could either drill for dollars or protect the citizens of our 
community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also in November, voters will decide how they want vacancies on the City 
Council filled when a council member is elected mayor or to some other higher 
office. JIM TORTOLANO

PRO-RABBIT FORCES HOPPING WITH JOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After weeks of arguments, the City Council has decided that the floppy-eared 
rabbits that irritated residents by snacking on their lawns but at the same 
time won the hearts of animal lovers can finally call Nature Park home. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week rejected a recommendation to turn the bunnies over 
to the local Humane Society. Instead, after listening to emotional testimony 
from pro-rabbit forces, the council decided to let the animals run free. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think that Cypress could afford to take care of these rabbits," said 
resident Jack Swank, who presented a petition to the City Coouncil that he said 
bore the signatures of about 700 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Added Ted Hill, another rabbit proponent: "We get all tied up with big 
buildings. We forget that there is a lot that Mother Nature can teach us." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Margaret M. Arnold cast the sole dissenting vote against the 
rabbits. She said the park is not a safe place for the animals, and that the 
city's decision amounts to "leaving them to cats and dogs who will destroy 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the rabbits, many of them abandoned Easter presents, has become the 
talk of the town. Last month, in response to complaints from neighbors who live 
near Nature Park, the Public Works Department tried to capture the animals. 
However, the department was thwarted by a disgruntled animal lover who stole 
the city's lone trap. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, to placate people on both sides of the issue, the council 
decided to fix the fence in Nature Park in an effort to keep the stray rabbits 
away from the lawns of residents. The city also refused to send the rabbits to 
Orange County Animal Control to be destroyed.

<P>
This week, in a review of its earlier decision, the council agreed to let the 
rabbits stay in the park. "The bunny issue is resolved," declared Mayor Cecilia 
L. Age. 
</P>
<P>
However, this may not be the last word about the rabbits. If the 30 or so 
rabbits -- notorious for their ability to reproduce -- are left in the confined 
area, hundreds may result. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are too many rabbits (the policy) will have to come back" before the 
council, Councilwoman Gail H. Kerry said. Some baby rabbits have already been 
discovered, city officials added. 
</P>
<P>
Age suggested advertising the availability of the rabbits around Easter or 
starting adopt-a-rabbit programs at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a sign will be posted to advise people of the proper food to 
feed the rabbits and city workers will continue to herd wandering bunnies back 
inside the park. LYNDA NATALI

SANTA CLARITA KILLS 135-ACRE HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council, ending the most divisive and bitter dispute in 
the young city's history, on Tuesday night voted to kill a proposal that would 
have netted the city millions of dollars in new roads in exchange for the 
council's approval of a controversial housing project. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to deny without prejudice the Santa Catarina project 
proposed by G.H. Palmer Associates. Councilman Carl Boyer III dissented. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jo Anne Darcy, who had long tried to forge a compromise to let Santa 
Catarina proceed, said she could no longer support the project because of its 
potential impact on the environment, particularly a nearby stream. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy, repeating concerns raised by critics of the proposal during months of 
public hearings, also said the 135-acre site in Canyon Country was not suited 
to high-density development. Homeowners living near the proposed Santa Catarina 
site had waged a vociferous, high-profile campaign against the Santa Catarina 
project for months. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy had been viewed as the swing vote on the council. Councilwomen Jan Heidt 
and Jill Klajic had opposed the project earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was modified many times during the past six months as city 
planners and representatives from Palmer Associates tried to hammer out a deal 
that would let the company build a condominium project in return for 
substantial contributions to roads badly needed in a city choked by traffic. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal would have let Palmer Associates build 1,452 units in return for 
more than $55 million in road projects in and around the proposed development. 
The Santa Catarina site is north of Soledad Canyon Road and southwest of Ermine 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Dan Palmer offered yet another compromise to the council Tuesday 
night. Among other things, he offered to build no more than 800 units and said 
he would redesign the project to protect the nearby stream. 
</P>
<P>
But Heidt, saying Santa Clarita should not even consider such a giant project 
until the city has completed its general plan, made a motion that the project 
be denied. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer tried to save the project, moving that the city retain an outside 
mediator to work with Palmer, the council and homeowners to find a solution. 
His motion died without a second. 
</P>
<P>
Critics and supporters of the project, however, agreed on one point Tuesday: 
The debate over Santa Catarina destroyed the sense of civic unity that 
prevailed in Santa Clarita shortly after it incorporated on Dec. 15, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy said there have been 10 council meetings and three Planning Commission 
hearings on the project. "It has literally torn this community apart," Darcy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a community sharply divided," Palmer said. He added: "I think it's 
time for this community to heal its wounds and lay down its swords." 
</P>
<P>
Boyer and Darcy said Tuesday that in recent weeks they had received increasing 
amounts of hate mail and threatening phone calls from opponents. "I have 
received slashed pictures of myself -- eight of them," Darcy said. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy said she disliked those tactics but they did not influence her vote.

PORTER RANCH: THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCILMAN ATTACKS SIMI VALLEY'S DECISION TO 
SUE TO STOP CONSTRUCTION OF 3,395 HOUSES IN CHATSWORTH. 
</P>

Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson lashed out at the Simi Valley City 
Council on Tuesday for voting to sue Los Angeles over the Porter Ranch 
development, saying that Simi Valley acted rashly and probably will fail in its 
quest to block the colossal project. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said Simi Valley officials should welcome Porter Ranch for the jobs it 
will provide, instead of filing an expensive lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just surprised that they didn't do a little more homework," said Bernson, 
whose district includes Porter Ranch in the western San Fernando Valley. "I 
think the City Council acted very rashly. I think they have been duped by the 
political opponents of Porter Ranch." 
</P>
<P>
But Simi Valley officials defended the action they took Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to take action because you are too timid or because you're afraid of 
losing is not the way to go," said Councilman Glen McAdoo. "When you have right 
on your side, you have an obligation to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted in closed session to sue the city of Los Angeles to halt the 
Porter Ranch development. The project, which would include 3,395 residences and 
6 million square feet of commercial space, would be built in Chatsworth, 
roughly five miles east of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The directors of PRIDE, a San Fernando Valley homeowners group opposed to 
Porter Ranch, said they planned to meet privately with San Francisco attorney 
Mark Weinberger on Tuesday night to discuss their own legal strategy, which may 
involve filing an independent lawsuit, said spokesman Don Worsham. 
</P>
<P>
Worsham said he was heartened by the action taken by the Simi Valley council. 
"We applaud and respect them for doing what is necessary to protect their 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bernson said PRIDE used Simi Valley to file a lawsuit for the group. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that what's really happening here is that that PRIDE group lacks 
the ability to finance their own lawsuit, so they have hoodwinked, 
sweet-talked, duped or whatever Simi Valley into initiating a lawsuit," Bernson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials said that the project, which would rank with Century City 
as one of the largest developments in Los Angeles history, would create 
tremendous amounts of smog in the region and turn the Simi Valley Freeway into 
a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
They said that their concerns about those issues were not adequately addressed 
in the environmental impact report on the project, and therefore they have no 
choice other than taking legal action. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 residents at Monday's Simi Valley council meeting spoke against filing 
a lawsuit because they said it did not make sense to spend hundreds of 
thousands of dollars on a losing battle. 
</P>
<P>
But McAdoo disagreed, saying that the people who spoke have probably not seen 
the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"What they are saying is it doesn't matter how inadequate the environmental 
impact report is, we shouldn't raise an objection," McAdoo said. "I find that 
position hard to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Clarke, a spokesman for the Porter Ranch Development Company, said he 
thinks the Simi Valley council's decision had more to do with politics than 
legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. bashing is great sport for Simi Valley politicians," Clarke said. "My 
initial reaction to the lawsuit is that four out of five Simi Valley City 
Council members are running for office." 
</P>
<P>
Council members Vicki Howard and Bill Davis are running for Ventura County 
supervisor, Greg Stratton is running for reelection as mayor, and Ann Rock is 
seeking to retain her City Council seat. 
</P>
<P>
According to the environmental impact report approved by the Los Angeles City 
Council, the Porter Ranch development will generate an additional 150,602 
vehicle trips per day in the surrounding area. Mayor Greg Stratton said the 
report does not adequately answer questions about how and when Los Angeles and 
the developer would compensate for the added traffic congestion and smog. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials want the project to be built in phases, with approval of 
each phase contingent on actual construction of additional freeway lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have some very specific items that need to be nailed down . . . and 
resolved," Stratton said. "Our goal is not to stop the project but to see that 
the environmental impacts of it are not detrimental to the citizens of Simi 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson blamed Simi Valley for many of the traffic tie-ups on the Simi Valley 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is, Simi Valley is the problem," Bernson said. "A 
great deal of the traffic on the Simi Valley Freeway is generated by Simi 
Valley residents who work in Los Angeles. They've allowed hundreds of thousands 
of homes to be built without jobs and other amenities that the community 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson also suggested that the city of Los Angeles in the future may impose an 
employment tax against non-Los Angeles residents. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials said they did not know how much it would cost to fight 
the planned development in court, but said that they believe it would be 
considerably less than the $500,000 some suggest. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley City Atty. John Torrance said the deadline for filing the city's 
suit is Aug. 9. Torrance said he was not sure yet whether Porter Ranch 
Development Co. would also be named in the suit. He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carreras, an official with the Southern California Assn. of Governments, 
said disputes between municipalities over growth issues are not uncommon, but 
that they generally do not end up in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it's rather an extreme step," Carreras said. But Carreras said 
there is no significant difference between an individual filing a lawsuit 
against a city as opposed to another municipality. 
</P>
<P>
"If the environmental impact report is inadequate, it's inadequate," Carreras 
said. "To the extent that this is true, they might very well have a good case. 
But they would be successful on the merits of the case, not because they are a 
city."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<P>
Balanced-Budget Amendment 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 279 to 150, the House failed to achieve the two-thirds majority 
needed to approve a constitutional amendment (HJR 268) requiring the federal 
government to balance its budget each year. Deficit spending was to have been 
outlawed except during wartime or if three-fifths majorities of the House and 
Senate voted to permit it. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Charles W. Stenholm (D-Tex.) said lawmakers lack "courage and guts" 
to master the deficit and therefore "we need some help, an extra tool. We need 
a balanced-budget amendment." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) said the measure "is filled with soft and fuzzy 
feel-good words that by themselves have no more legislative meaning than a 
bumper sticker that says 'Have a Nice Day.' " 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the constitutional amendment.

Balanced-Budget Statute 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 282 to 114, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 5258) 
requiring that the President and congressional budget committees draft balanced 
federal budgets each year showing the exact spending cuts and revenue hikes 
they recommend to stay out of the red. If Congress votes down the proposals, it 
would then pass a standard deficit-laden budget to run the government. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders produced the bill to counter the GOP plan (above) to balance 
the budget by constitutional amendment. They said it was important for 
balanced-budget advocates to state precisely how they would avoid a deficit. 
But Republicans denounced the bill as political cover for those who voted 
against the constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the Democratic bill.

To Cut Farm Spending 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 202 to 216, the House refused to cut discretionary spending in a 
fiscal 1991 agriculture appropriations bill (HR 5268) by 2% across the board, 
saving $150 million. Exempted from the cut was to have been a nutritional 
program for poor infants and spending mandated by law. The $50.4-billion 
measure (HR 5268) was sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.) said the "very modest" cut would help offset 
the bill's 11.5% increase over 1990 spending. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Jamie L. Whitten (D-Miss.) said he believes in a balanced federal 
budget "but not at the expense of sound and essential programs." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the 2% cut.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hazel May Hall, who worked as a registered nurse in Glendale hospitals for 26 
years, has died in Glendale. She was 84. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Hall died Sunday of respiratory problems, said her daughter, Mary 
McGindley. 
</P>
<P>
She was born Hazel May Ruby in Orleans, Neb., on March 8, 1906. She began her 
35-year nursing career in Hastings, Neb., in 1928, moving in 1937 to Glendale, 
where she worked at area hospitals until her retirement in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, she was president of the Glendale Police Wives Club. Her

commendation by local, state and federal government officials for community 
service, her daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her sons, Dale Hall and Harold Hall, both of Sacramento; a 
daughter, Mary McGindley of Westchester; 12 grandchildren and six 
great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>

GAIDO SUES TO FILL IRVINE COUNCIL VACANCY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THIRD-HIGHEST VOTE-GETTER CLAIMS THE SEAT SHOULD BE HERS WITHOUT A 
SPECIAL NOVEMBER ELECTION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mary Ann Gaido, the third-highest vote-getter in the June council race, has 
filed a lawsuit claiming that she should immediately be appointed to fill a 
council seat left vacant by Sally Anne Sheridan's elevation to mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed Monday in Orange County Superior Court, is the second in two 
years concerning the city's Measure D, an election law passed by voters in 1988 
that has mired city officials in legal squabbles and cost the taxpayers 
$163,000 to date. 
</P>
<P>
Gaido's suit challenges a provision in Measure D that allows a special election 
to fill an unexpired term of a council member elected mayor if at least 7% of 
the city's registered voters sign petitions. If no petitions are filed, the 
third-highest vote-getter fills the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city clerk last week certified 3,965 petition signatures, or 103 
more than the required 7%, Gaido and her attorneys Stephen Coontz and Franklin 
J. Lunding claim that at least 500 of those signatures are invalid. Eliminating 
the questionable signatures would invalidate the petitions for a special 
election and make Gaido eligible to be sworn in immediately, Coontz said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also says that petitions calling for the November election were 
improperly worded because they do not inform signers that the vacancy could be 
filled without an election. 
</P>
<P>
"The June election was a vote of the people, and overturning that vote has to 
be done in a serious manner," said Gaido, who received 11,096 votes in the June 
5 election behind Barry J. Hammond's 11,629 votes and William A. (Art) 
Bloomer's 11,702 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lawsuit, the council voted 4 to 0 to set the special council 
election for the Nov. 6 ballot, leaving the city with a four-member council 
until then. The council also voted unanimously to place a measure on the same 
ballot that would repeal Measure D and reverse another election law passed in 
1987 that calls for the election of mayor by city voters. Sheridan defeated 
incumbent Larry Agran by a narrow margin last month to become the city's second 
directly elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In her first action after taking office on Friday, Sheridan requested that 
Measure D be repealed. She has contested the law since it went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never approved of the system," said Sheridan, who refused to participate 
in the petition drive against Gaido. "But now that it is being used I have to 
uphold it." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan previously had said that she wanted Gaido seated on the council rather 
than prolong the confusion over Measure D by holding a special election in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not have been unhappy about that," Sheridan said in an interview 
before Tuesday's council meeting. "I could have worked with Mary Ann Gaido." 
</P>
<P>
Gaido ran on a slate with Agran and former Councilman Cameron Cosgrove -- a 
slate perceived as a liberal departure from Orange County's conservative 
politics. The new council majority of Sheridan, Hammond and Bloomer has vowed 
to swing the pendulum back. 
</P>
<P>
But UC Berkeley urban planning professor Ray Catalano, a former Irvine 
councilman who often cast swing votes during his 1986 term, warned that seating 
another conservative council member via a special election would be a "big 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
"Irvine is simply not a 4-1 city," said Catalano, referring to council votes. 
"The outcome of the last election reflects the anger by the populace over that 
perceived imbalance. If there is another extreme majority you could have the 
same problems of political resentment and distrust. With Gaido, it would be a 
well-balanced council that reflects the values of a large, diverse city." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the council decided that Coontz and Lunding, who recently 
completed a report on Measure D for the city, have a conflict of interest by 
representing Gaido in her lawsuit. According to Assistant City Atty. John 
Fellows, State Bar rules of conduct say that an attorney cannot represent a new 
client in a manner that would be adverse to a former client. 
</P>
<P>
However, Coontz said an attorney can represent a client against a former client 
as long as he has not gained confidential information that could be used in a 
case against the former client. Coontz said that in reviewing Measure D, he and 
Lunding were dealing with public documents, and did not receive any 
confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
Coontz represented Cosgrove in a previous lawsuit on Measure D, filed by city 
residents Howard Klein and Christina Bustos, shortly after the June, 1988, 
election, when Measure D was approved by city voters and Agran was elected 
mayor. Cosgrove, like Gaido, was the third highest vote-getter. 
</P>
<P>
That suit claimed that Cosgrove did not have a right to complete Agran's 
unexpired council term because petitions were being circulated under Measure D 
for a special election. However, a Superior Court judge ruled that Cosgrove was 
sworn in before Measure D took effect and could therefore remain on the 
council.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HELD IN SERIES OF PURSE THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 39-year-old Van Nuys man was being held Tuesday in connection with a series 
of purse snatchings in the northeast San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Douglas Haylock was arrested Monday night in Sylmar after police 
watched him get into a stolen car that matched the description of a car used in 
at least two purse snatchings, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's suspected of several purse snatchings and other crimes," Detective Mike 
Wynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bernard D. Conine said police have been investigating a series of purse 
snatches and thefts from cars in recent weeks in which the victims were 
followed by a second vehicle. The driver of the second vehicle jumped from the 
car and grabbed a purse or belongings then sped away, police said. On Monday 
night officers found a stolen car parked near Hubbard Street and Dronfield 
Avenue. After learning that it was similar to a car used in the thefts, the 
officers began watching the vehicle. About 9 p.m. Haylock allegedly got into 
the vehicle and sped away when officers tried to stop him. The chase ended 
several blocks away when Haylock stopped at Desmond Street and Glenoaks 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Haylock was arrested on suspicion of robbery and was being held in lieu of 
$15,000 bail at the Foothill Division Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Conine said investigators were attempting to determine how many thefts were 
part of the series and if there is evidence that might link Haylock to other 
incidents.

CONTROVERSIAL VOTE TO EXPAND SUNSHINE LANDFILL ON SCHEDULE; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS: BOARD HAS A CHANGE OF HEART ON DELAYING ACTION. OPPONENTS BLAME 
LOBBYING BY THE DUMP'S OPERATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors refused Tuesday to delay a vote 
scheduled for today on the controversial proposal to expand the Sunshine Canyon 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Regional Planning Commission is scheduled to vote on 
Browning-Ferris Industries' proposal to expand its 230-acre dump near Granada 
Hills into 542 acres of unincorporated county land. 
</P>
<P>
The board's inaction Tuesday was a dramatic reversal from last week, when a 
board majority indicated sympathy with dump opponents asking for the delay. On 
Tuesday, however, neither Ed Edelman nor Kenneth Hahn would even second a 
motion by Mike Antonovich to delay the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The board's inaction Tuesday angered dump opponents who wanted more time to 
respond to new information that Browning-Ferris included in an environmental 
impact report on the project. The Planning Commission appeared to be on the 
verge of approving the project in February when a county attorney warned that 
the environmental impact report was incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Dump opponents accused Edelman and Hahn, the board's two liberals, of caving in 
under lobbying by Browning-Ferris Industries. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich also blamed lobbying by BFI and pressure from the city of Los 
Angeles, which favors the dump expansion, for changing his colleagues' minds. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Ed Edelman and Kenny Hahn ignored the people's request to have 
further input," Antonovich said. "I feel Edelman and Hahn's shortsightedness is 
a slap in the face" to the homeowner groups opposed to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Funk, an attorney for Browning-Ferris, said James E. Hartl, the county's 
chief planner, and Browning-Ferris explained to the supervisors during the past 
week why their initial vote was misguided. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week those two people voted without realizing what the process was," Funk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the politicians and their staff said they changed their minds for other 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said he switched sides after learning from the county's top planning 
official that the 30-day delay could set the proposed project back several 
months. He added that there would be ample time for the landfill's detractors, 
who previously testified against the project before the Planning Commission, to 
testify again when the project comes before the Board of Supervisors for final 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"The community already has had a public hearing, and we'll have a public 
hearing," Edelman said. "No sense setting it back." 
</P>
<P>
Mas Fukai, Hahn's chief deputy, said that discussion with Browning-Ferris 
representatives did not influence his boss. 
</P>
<P>
"They will never strong-arm Kenny Hahn," Fukai said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SIMI VALLEY MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Simi Valley man pleaded guilty Tuesday iS. District Court in Los Angeles to 
two counts of mail fraud and one count of bank fraud for his role in one of the 
largest Ponzi schemes in the country, which bilked about $12 million from more 
than 200 unsuspecting investors. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dumas, 36, who served as vice president of the Woodland Hills-based 
California Anchor Group, admitted that he lured potential investors into the 
real estate investment firm although he knew it was not a legitimate business, 
Assistant U. S. Atty. Anita Dymant said. 
</P>
<P>
California Anchor was supposed to be turning a tremendous profit from the 
development and sale of apartment buildings in the San Fernando Valley, and 
investors were usually promised a return on their investments of 25%. 
</P>
<P>
But although the company owned some properties, most of the interest payments 
came from money supplied by new investors. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme, which began in September, 1983, collapsed in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing has not yet been scheduled for Dumas, who faces 12 years in prison 
and $505,000 in fines, Dymant said.

STUDENTS USE HANDS-ON APPROACH IN UCLA PROGRAM ON RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEN SULLIVAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Digging through household trash is usually the province of cheap private eyes 
and tabloid reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But for 70 UCLA Extension students, it's a summer job unlike any other. 
</P>
<P>
The students for the last three weeks have been pawing through truckloads of 
garbage -- in 90-degree-plus heat, for no pay -- at the Azusa Land Reclamation 
Co. dump. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing protective jumpsuits, face masks and double layers of gloves, the 
students are working to answer a question of increasing importance to 
California cities: 
</P>
<P>
What exactly is in all those garbage bags? 
</P>
<P>
The students are enrolled in UCLA's Extension Program in municipal solid waste 
management, a first of its kind project to train people to start city recycling 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The students are sorting, weighing and recording the makeup of residential 
waste samples. By figuring out what goes into the city's garbage stream, they 
will better know how to get recyclable materials out, program director Eugene 
Tseng said. 
</P>
<P>
When they finish with the residential waste, students will attack truckloads of 
commercial and industrial garbage to get an overall city "waste 
characterization." In all, they will sort through three tons of garbage. 
Project planners expect to be done by December. 
</P>
<P>
Most participants in the extension program are local waste management industry 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very wacky, but it's for a good cause. People are very wasteful and 
recycling is something we're going to have to do. It's great, I love trash," 
said Cristin Brame, 22, a landfill employee enrolled in the course. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Cheng, of the People's Republic of China, is director of solid waste 
research at the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences. Cheng said 
he will take the technical and practical information he gets from the program 
back to China to deal with his country's garbage dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no landfills now, so you can imagine how serious a problem it is," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
California is facing a shortage of landfill space. Gov. George Deukmejian 
signed a law last September requiring cities to cut their landfill-bound waste 
by 25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, cities will have to establish municipal recycling programs, 
but there is a "critical shortfall of qualified, trained people in the field" 
to help them, Tseng said. The UCLA program will help provide the needed people, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the classroom the dump provides, Azusa will get a tailor-made design 
for its recycling program. But "other cities are just kind of wondering how 
they're going to do it," said Ann Baba, project manager for the UCLA-Azusa 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa currently has no municipal recycling program.

This couldn't have been a team that had lost eight in a row, 12 of 13 and 24 of 
27, among the worst such numbers in club history. 
</P>
<P>
This couldn't be a team on a collision course with the bottom of the National 
League West standings. Could it? 
</P>
<P>
This team showed heart, character, talent and promise -- all the things 
everyone thought it had until it began to collapse just before the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres kicked some tail Tuesday night: 10-0. Repeat, 10-0, behind a 
two-hitter by Bruce Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
These were the big, bad, Cincinnati Reds, possessors of the best record in 
baseball and a team that had likewise routed the Padres, 9-2, Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Padres a season-high eight-game losing streak, their longest 
since 1980. The club record is 10 set in 1972 and tied in '73 and '74. And no 
one in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium was more happy to see that record stay 
intact than Padre Manager Greg Riddoch, who won for just the second time in 13 
games since taking over from Jack McKeon July 11. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a lot smarter than I was last night," said Riddoch, who spent most of 
Monday night answering letters in his stadium office until 4:30 a.m., then 
sleeping on his office couch. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "When they got going, it was kind of catchy. I felt great for them. 
The guys weren't apprehensive." 
</P>
<P>
One of those letters Riddoch answered was from Detroit Manager Sparky Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
In it, Anderson said: "You are not special. You can't make it happen. You can 
only help the players' attitudes. . . . If you can change their attitudes, then 
you'll change their play." 
</P>
<P>
Said Riddoch: "Success helps change people's attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
Hurst, plagued by lack of support early this year, got plenty Tuesday but 
needed little. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst (6-8) was brilliant, allowing just two hits and two walks while striking 
out eight. 
</P>
<P>
It was his second two-hitter of the year and fifth of his career. His other 
this season -- on July 7, when he beat St. Louis, 3-1 -- was also his last 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst also earned his 16th career shutout and first since Sept. 12, 1989, a 9-0 
victory over Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never caught him before," catcher Tom Lampkin said. "I told him before 
the game, 'You just go ahead and throw your game.' He was throwing the ball 
exactly where he wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, the Padres had many stars while collecting 16 hits. Every starter 
except Hurst had at least one, with Tony Gwynn collecting three and Bip 
Roberts, Roberto Alomar, Joe Carter, Mike Pagliarulo and Garry Templeton two 
each. Runs-batted-in leaders were Alomar with three and Gwynn and Lampkin with 
two each. 
</P>
<P>
The action started early as the Padres jumped on All-Star starter Jack 
Armstrong (11-6) for two runs on three hits and a walk in the first. With two 
outs and Alomar on first after a single, Jack Clark walked. Carter lined a 
single up the middle, scoring Alomar and giving the Padres a rare lead. 
</P>
<P>
How rare? Well, they had gone 56 consecutive innings without leading after a 
full inning before Sunday, when they briefly pulled ahead of St. Louis, 4-3, 
before losing, 6-4. They hadn't led since. 
</P>
<P>
After Carter, Pagliarulo singled to left to drive in Clark, and it was 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth, it became a rout as the Padres scored five runs on six hits and 
three walks while sending 11 batters to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong was charged with the first seven runs, raising his ERA to 3.08 from 
2.69. Reliever Tim Birtsas didn't fare much better, allowing three runs and 
seven hits over the final 3 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton started the Padre fifth by ripping a hanging curve down the 
right-field line for a double. Hurst then bunted an 1-and-2 pitch in front of 
the plate, and catcher Joe Oliver's throw to try to nail Templeton at third was 
late. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts doubled, driving in Templeton. Alomar singled, driving in Hurst and 
Roberts, and it was 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Five batters later, Lampkin's first two RBIs as a big leaguer made it 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres added a single run in the sixth on an RBI single by Gwynn and two in 
the eighth on a sacrifice fly by Alomar and an RBI double by Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
Even as well as things were going for the new Padres, there were still a few 
signs of the old team, chiefly base-running blunders. 
</P>
<P>
Three Padres were caught astray and put out on rundowns after RBI hits. Carter 
was caught rounding second too wide after Pagliarulo's RBI single in the first. 
Alomar was nailed between first and second after his two-RBI single in the 
fifth. And Gwynn was guilty of the same mistake after his RBI single in the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the base paths, Gwynn was thrown out at home by left fielder Glenn 
Braggs in the fifth after being sent by Sandy Alomar, the third base coach, on 
a line single to left by Carter. Earlier that inning, Hurst was held up by 
Alomar on Roberts' double, which was misplayed by right fielder Paul O'Neill in 
the Reds' bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well. You can't expect a complete turnaround in a mere 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Today's doubleheader marks the first of three makeup games at home with the 
Reds because of the player lockout that delayed by one week the opening of the 
season. The second makeup with the Reds will be Aug. 1. at the conclusion of 
this home stand. It would have been a travel day for both the Reds and Padres 
as the two meet in Cincinnati Aug. 2-5. Instead, Cincinnati will have to come 
to San Diego from Los Angeles for the one game. 
</P>
<P>
The first game of today's doubleheader is at 5:05 p.m., a change from the 
original schedule. Calvin Schiraldi will make his first start of the season, 
replacing Andy Benes, who still has some stiffness in his left shoulder 
stemming from a scuffle July 12 in Pittsburgh. Benes, who will miss his second 
consecutive start, will pitch Friday against Houston, Manager Greg Riddoch 
said. In four 1989 starts, Schiraldi won three games and had a no-decision in 
the other after coming to the Padres in a trade with the Chicago Cubs. With the 
Cubs in 1988 -- his only full season as a starter -- Schiraldi was 9-13 with a 
4.38 ERA. Schiraldi is 2-2 this year with a 3.62 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Whitson (7-7) will pitch the first game. The Reds will counter with Norm 
Charlton (8-4) and Rick Mahler (4-3). . . . The Reds have swept neither a 
doubleheader nor a four-game series at San Diego, making the Padres the only 
club that can make both claims. . . . Friday's game has been moved to 7:35 p.m. 
to accommodate the festivities of the salute to Joan Kroc. . . . Before 
Saturday's game, there will be an Equitable Old-Timers home run hitting contest 
featuring Hall of Famers Eddie Mathews, Ernie Banks, Billy Williams and Lou 
Brock. Of the 29 players competing on two teams, seven are former pitchers, 
including Rollie Fingers, Tim Stoddard and Bill (The Spaceman) Lee. . . . Eddie 
Williams' home run in Monday's game came in his first at-bat ever in San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium. In high school, Williams was the San Diego Section player 
of the year in 1983 while leading Hoover High to the Class 2-A title.

SEMI-PRO FOOTBALL PLAYERS HAVE LITTLE GLORY, HIGH HOPES; 
</P>
<P>
RHINOS: SOME PLAY FOR LOVE OF THE GAME, AND OTHERS ADMIT THEY WANT TO BE 
SPOTTED BY NFL SCOUTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is a strange mix of players running through drills at a recent tryout for 
the Orange County Rhinos, one of three semi-professional football teams in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these guys have never played high school ball," Rhinos' 
co-owner/defensive coach Carl Babb said as he watched them go through drills at 
Brookhurst Park in Anaheim. "And if you get into it with them, you'll find that 
some who have (played in high school) never got on the field. But there's 
nothing here we can't work with." 
</P>
<P>
The Rhinos, who are scheduled to play six home games, beginning Aug. 11, at La 
Habra High School, play in the shadows of professional, collegiate and prep 
teams. They play for no money and little glory. For most of those involved the 
game itself is its only reward, although some harbor the slim hope of playing 
in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"Scouts will show up and look at the guys," Babb said. "That's not to say they 
will ever contact them but they will show up." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Tedford has played semi-pro football on and off for the past 13 years, the 
past four as the Rhinos' starting quarterback. He has been through unsuccessful 
tryouts with the Rams and several Canadian teams. 
</P>
<P>
"There are guys out here who realistically could compete in an NFL camp," 
Tedford said. "There are some guys here who can seriously play the game but 
will never get the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
But, still, many of the players continue to hope. Mike Cunningham, a contractor 
from Fullerton, is a leader on the Rhinos' offensive line. "I'd like to try to 
get into the NFL," Cunningham said. "I'm going to try to bring a new kind of 
aggressiveness to the offensive line. Maybe that means I'll have to start 
smashing helmets or something." 
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, they also play just to play. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Montez and his brother Paul own and coach the Orange County Cowboys, who 
play at Buena Park High School's field. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Montez, a former high school and semi-pro offensive guard, began coaching 
when injuries to both of his hamstrings prevented him from playing any longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I coached the first few games in my football pants with my pads near by," 
Montez said. "I just hoped that somehow I could get into the game. After a 
while, some of my players told me that I could either be a player or a coach -- 
one or the other. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons a lot of us do this is we love the sport. We can't give it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
For some of the players, love of the sport is the only motivation. Tom Turner, 
28, played outside linebacker for UNLV during the early 1980s. His friend Jim 
Anmus, 31, was a receiver for the University of Hawaii. "This (semi-pro) is to 
know that we can still play ball," Turner said at the Rhinos' tryout. 
</P>
<P>
Semi-pro football certainly offers few fringe benefits for the players to love. 
</P>
<P>
The Rhinos receive no salary and in fact have to pay a fee of $106 a season to 
cover the costs of referees' fees, group insurance and other expenses. Cowboys' 
rookie players pay $150; veterans pay $125. 
</P>
<P>
Babb and Barry Robinson, who also co-owns the Rhinos and coaches their offense, 
bought the team in 1987 with no money up front and a handshake agreement to 
take over expenses. Babb and Robinson together lost $2,800 on the Rhinos last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys and the Rhinos play in the High Desert League. Jim Lott, 85, 
founded the league 54 years ago and still serves as its commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Lott owns 28 semi-professional teams throughout California and Mexico, but 
chooses not to take an active role with his teams. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, owning a semi-pro team means you own second-hand suits and somebody 
wears them," Lott said. "I gave them the suits and I can hire and fire anybody 
I want to . . . to me there's no ownership." 
</P>
<P>
Babb is a supervisor at a meat-packing plant in Southgate. Robinson is a 
circulation manager for the Orange County Register. The Montez brothers are 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
And all of their players also do something else besides play football to earn a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why all the teams play fairly clean," Tom Montez said. "Everybody's got 
to work the next day." 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see some of the pro guys work a 40-hour week and then come out 
and play football." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, off-the-field responsibilities hurt the Rhinos defense. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason a lot of the boys had conflicts with their jobs," Babb said. 
"We had trouble getting the same guys out every weekend." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the 1989 Rhino defense gave up 54 points -- 20 more than it did 
during the 1988 season and the most it ever has in its four years under Babb. 
</P>
<P>
This season, a group of ex-Rhinos, led by Gil Harris, started the Orange Coast 
Dolphins, the third semi-pro football team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a stockbroker from Fountain Valley, played free safety for the Rhinos 
for five years. He left in frustration with the High Desert League for what he 
called a lack of organization and an inability to promote itself. 
</P>
<P>
The Rhinos' and Cowboys' owners conceded that most of the fans in attendence at 
their games are their players' families and friends. Harris explained why: "For 
the fans, they have a million and a half things to go out and do here in 
Southern California . . . You name it, it's out here." 
</P>
<P>
It is why Robinson and Babb have hired professional promoters for the Rhinos 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
It is also why Harris is not expecting a quick return on his investment. But he 
retains the hope of many of those connected with semi-pro football: 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a hobby, but hopefully it will blossom into something a little 
bit more than that."

DIVING: RISKING DEATH, PARALYSIS AND OTHER SERIOUS INJURIES, DIVERS TAKE PLUNGE 
JUST FOR THE RUSH OF IT.

<TEXT>
<P>
As a construction worker, Jerry Barton of North Park often found himself 
perched precariously in high places . . . and he couldn't stand it. 
</P>
<P>
Barton suffered from acrophobia, the fear of heights. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of quitting his job, Barton, 24, looked to conquer his fear. 
</P>
<P>
He went cliff diving. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Barton says, no height is too high. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can go up real high and get right to the edge, no problem," he said. 
"Cliff diving really helped me with my phobia." 
</P>
<P>
Sound crazy? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but Barton's case seemed one of the more utilitarian ones from the 30 
or so who were jumping on a recent Sunday afternoon off an area known as The 
Arch along Sunset Cliffs Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what it is. It's a sense of freedom," said Jeff Hoover, 21, of 
San Diego. "Once you're gone, nobody can stop you. For that two or three 
seconds, you're totally free." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jim Houllahan, 20, of Ocean Beach: "Just the thrill. It's a rush. Feels 
like you're falling forever." 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Kelly, a 28-year-old high school English teacher from Chicago, 
offered this rationale: "You ought to try teaching in Chicago. This is 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
While cliff diving in San Diego County may not be as popular as in places such 
as Acapulco, it certainly exists here. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, do the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Divers risk death, paralysis and other serious injuries. And should the they 
make it through their plunges physically unscathed, the thrill-seekers also 
face citations and fines in certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, anywhere there is high terrain with sufficient water below, somebody 
probably has jumped. But it's not legal to do so in some places, including The 
Clam in La Jolla and Box Canyon in Carlsbad, which feature ledges from 20 to 
100 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
"At The Clam or Dead Man's (Point), there are signs posted," said Wayne Auer, 
supervisor for San Diego lifeguards. "It's an illegal situation, and we 
certainly don't condone doing it. It's something on face value that doesn't 
appear to be a serious offense, and that makes it more difficult when we try to 
enforce the laws. It creates too much of a potential liability situation for 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
Auer added, "It's the No. 1 problem I have to deal with. I wish it would all go 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Boyd, 17, of San Carlos, said he and a friend were cited a few months ago in 
La Jolla. But when Boyd appeared in court, he said, he found that for some 
reason, the paperwork had not been filed. And his friend got off by telling the 
judge it was his first time and that he was unaware of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, a spectacular diver despite no formal training in the sport, was at The 
Arch recently performing a number of pikes, tucks and layouts off the cliffs, 
which range in height from 20 to 60 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I do something new, it's scary," he said. "But after you do it 
once, it's easy." 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said he has never been injured, but he has seen plenty who have been. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, he said, the people who get injured are those who jump while under the 
influence of alcohol or drugs, or push themselves beyond their capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
George Bull, 17, of Escondido, has a long scar on the underside of his left arm 
because he miscalculated a 100-foot attempt at Box Canyon. He nevertheless 
continues diving. He and a group of friends got together for a few jumps last 
Wednesday at the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better than a roller coaster," said Escondido's Christy Tracy, 15. "Your 
heart feels like you left it behind." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy added that her father, Dick Tracy, used to come to Box Canyon when he was 
a kid. "When I found that out, I asked him, 'Dad, why didn't you ever tell me 
about this place?' He said, 'Because I didn't want you to come.' " 
</P>
<P>
Safety at nearly all ocean areas such as The Arch or The Clam depends greatly 
on the level of the tide. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you're Henri La Mothe, diving into anything less than a high tide can be 
extremely hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
As for La Mothe, well, he set a world record for diving 28 feet into 12 3/8 
inches of water in 1979. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, La 
Mothe struck the water chest first at a speed of 28.4 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
He was 75 at the time.

TUSTIN COMPUTER FIRM EXPANDS SALES IN EAST GERMANY

MAI Basic Four Inc. said Tuesday that it has signed agreements to sell $2.5 
million worth of computers and software to six East German hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the MAI 8020 computers comes about five weeks after the company 
sponsored a product fair in West Berlin attended by several hundred East German 
hospital administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The fair was part of a push by MAI to become a major supplier of computers to 
East German hospitals as that country begins to modernize its medical 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The MAI 8020 systems, an older-generation computer that supports up to 96 
users, will be used for billing, monitoring of patients and other hospital 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
The first system, worth about $500,000, was recently installed in a 1,000-bed 
hospital in Frankfurt, East Germany. The system will be upgraded next month, 
when anticipated changes in Western export regulations are expected to ease 
restrictions on the type of computers that can be sent to East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
MAI plans to open a marketing and software development office in Leipzig, East 
Germany, in early 1991, said Gerd Steffen, general manager of MAI's subsidiary 
in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Tustin firm sold computer systems to five Opel car 
dealers and two breweries in East Germany, said Bernard Jubb, an MAI spokesman.

ALMANAC: AEROSPACE EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK;

FUNDING CUTS HIT DEFENSE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Signs of the decline in federal dollars for defense are showing up in 
employment levels in Orange County's high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of continuous real growth, peaking in 1985, increases in defense 
spending have hovered around zero since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, employment levels in key defense-related industries have fallen as 
much as 14%. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the Chapman Center for Economic Research predicts further 
cuts in defense spending: 3% to 4% in 1990, 5% to 10% in 1991, and 5.5% to 
11.5% in 1992. The study's authors estimate that the country could lose as many 
as 6,000 aerospace industry jobs by 1992.

U.S. DEFENSE SPENDING: PAST AND FUTURE 
</P>
<P>
After years of lagging behind a mounting inflation rate in the 1970s, defense 
spending entered an era of real growth that lasted for more than a decade. The 
future looks bleak, however, according to forecasts issued by the Chapman 
College Center for Economic Research. The chart below shows two scenarios: One 
anticipates moderate cuts in defense spending and the other, sharp cuts.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS GET BOOST FROM S&amp;L GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three affordable housing projects in Orange County received a financial boost 
recently from a special subsidy program mandated by last year's federal law 
that restructured the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
The projects are among 31 in California, Arizona and Nevada to win the first 
round of S&amp;L grants totaling $12.1 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank 
in San Francisco, one of 12 regional banks in the federal system that provides 
credit to savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
The winning projects were chosen from 43 applications from 34 institutions 
seeking $39.4 million in subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The thrifts are required to ultimately pass the savings to the buyers and 
renters of low- and moderate-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
ITT Federal Bank in Irvine will be receiving $43,327 to pay for an Orange 
County Community Housing Corp. project for acquiring six condominium sites in 
Irvine. The units would be available as rentals to households earning up to 
30%, or in some cases up to 50%, of median income for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Plaza Savings &amp; Loan of Santa Ana will receive $9,499 to fund Community 
Housing's acquisition and rehabilitation of 20 rental apartments for low-income 
large families in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
First Nationwide Bank in San Francisco will get $21,000 to help the Civic 
Center Barrio Housing Corp. in Santa Ana build six condominiums for very 
low-income families to lease with an option to buy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Plaza Savings and 22 other thrifts will share in a $1.3-million 
grant to the Savings Assns. Mortgage Co. for projects to be identified by 
SAMCO. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco district bank is funding the great majority of the nation's 
affordable housing projects. The bank's $12.1 million in first-round subsidies 
is more than 25% of the $47.2 million provided by all 12 district banks. Its 
money will be used to provide 5,514 housing units. The bank is taking 
applications through August for $8 million in funding that will be offered 
later this year. It will then hold two competitions a year, one in January and 
one in July.

JACK SMITH: MAN TAKES UMBRAGE AT REMARKS ABOUT WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My recent observations that American women in the 1920s were prisoners of 
household drudgery -- a conclusion derived from a 1920 issue of Ladies' Home 
Journal -- did not provoke as much flak as I expected. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, when I write about women, however noble my intention, I am accused of 
naivete, stupidity, prejudice, or, at the least, chauvinism, a word for whose 
corruption the feminist movement is entirely to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, I am accused of these faults, by implication, by a male attorney, 
Frank L. Swan of Newport Beach. As he sums it up, in a phrase, "(You make) me 
want to puke." 
</P>
<P>
Swan's perfectly sound point is that men's lives weren't idyllic. "What do you 
think men were doing in those days? They were working their humps off in 
low-paying, dull, menial, backbreaking jobs . . . 12 hours a day, six or seven 
days a week. If you want to talk about prison, man, that's real prison. 
</P>
<P>
"It's knuckleheads like you who have whipped a whole generation of women into a 
frenzy in which a good number of them will self-destruct. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I can think of all kinds of things men did: They worked in steel mills, 
they dug coal, they made sausages, they ran streetcars, they delivered ice, 
they walked beats, they made house calls, they ran pawn shops, they erected 
buildings, they collected trash, they worked in the stock market pits, they 
filled teeth, they built roads, they worked at wireless keys, they butchered 
hogs, and, of course, they practiced law. 
</P>
<P>
I have no doubt that gentlemen of Mr. Swan's profession routinely provided 
their wives with state-of-the-art vacuum cleaners and washing machines, but 
that when they came home in the evening, exhausted from a day of torts and 
motions, they were too tired for anything but "yes" and "no" conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Swan failed to note that Prohibition had deprived males of one of their 
historic rights in America, the right to stop off in a saloon on the way home 
and get roaring drunk, a condition that inevitably inhibited sophisticated 
conversation with their culture-hungry wives. Of course bootleg whiskey and 
speak-easies were still available to the prosperous, but the blue-collar 
working man could not afford those amenities, and was, in effect, locked out of 
the once wide-open and friendly corner saloon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many of their wives were doubtless swigging Lydia Pinkham's 
Vegetable Compound, a popular eau de vivre that somehow helped women get 
through their days and put them in a good mood for their husbands' return. My 
mother imbibed this potent extract regularly. I always suspected that it 
contained a high percentage of ethyl alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Swan is right in saying that men worked long hours for low pay in the early 
part of the century, but of course Wall Street teemed with white-collar workers 
who never dirtied their hands except with ticker tape, and who were protected 
from prosecution for illegal practices by their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Public and legislative apathy protected rich industrialists of the 19th Century 
who exploited children in their factories. Boys worked from dawn to dark in 
coal mines, girls labored the same long days at machines in textile mills. They 
couldn't even solace themselves with a drink when they got off. 
</P>
<P>
The novelist John Trentwood Moore wrote of these children: "Years in the 
factory had made them dead, listless, soulless and ambitionless creatures. . . 
. (They) worked in the factory because no man or woman in all the state cared 
enough for them to make a fight for their childhood. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In most states, in 1900, it was not illegal to send children as young as 7 or 8 
into a mill and keep them at work unlimited hours. . . . In 1904 John Spargo 
wrote "Statistics cannot express the withering of child lips in the poisoned 
air of factories; the tired, strained look of child eyes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
By 1915, 33 states required children to attend school to the age of 16; but a 
federal child labor law passed in 1916 was struck down by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Men still work hard today. They build steel skyscrapers; they collect trash, 
they butcher hogs, they dig coal, they wash cars, they try lawsuits, they write 
columns, though of course women also try lawsuits and write columns. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if, when Swan says a good number of frenzied women will 
"self-destruct" he means women lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
He also scorns my question: What would my mother do with her artistic impulse 
if she were a young housewife today, instead of in 1920? 
</P>
<P>
He says, "That blows my mind. I wonder what your ol' lady would say if all of a 
sudden you told her that you 'aspired to the arts' and therefore you weren't 
going to bring home any more bread." 
</P>
<P>
She would probably buy me a box of paints. 
</P>
<P>
Swan concludes philosophically: "I will tell you what life is about, man! It's 
about dedication and devotion to duty and responsibility. It's not about 
self-indulgence." 
</P>
<P>
Good thing Gauguin didn't know that.

SCRATCH-ITCH SEASON OF THE FLEA RETURNS; 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMERS: EXPERTS RECOMMEND SOME PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO HEAD OFF THE INVASION. 
IF AN INFESTATION DOES OCCUR, VETERINARIANS CAN OFFER SOME SOLUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On guard, consumers: It's flea time again. And this year there are two kinds of 
the tiny biting insects that may terrorize you and your pets. 
</P>
<P>
The cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) that usually invades Southern California 
yards and homes with the summer heat and humidity is being joined this season 
by another variety, the sticktight flea (Echidnophaga gallinacea), which is not 
normally found on domestic cats and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Both fleas are blood-sucking insects that cause animals and their owners to 
itch and scratch. But the female sticktight attaches itself to the skin, much 
like a tick, and doesn't hop around. The sticktight is a third smaller than the 
tiny cat flea, so it is even harder to see. 
</P>
<P>
"The sticktight flea is not new in Los Angeles, but it is being newly 
encountered in domestic pets," said Gail Van Gordon, public health entomologist 
with the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. "It is normally 
found in the rodent population in the more remote, higher areas. But with the 
drought, rodents are coming down from the upper areas and the flea migrates 
with its natural host." 
</P>
<P>
Swell, so that's all sticky, smoggy Los Angeles needs this summer: a double 
dose of acrobatic critters (fleas can jump 13 inches horizontally; eight inches 
straight up). 
</P>
<P>
What to do? Practice a little preventive flea medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gordon recommends that Southern Californians "step up their normal flea 
eradication process." Spray yards with "any recommended insecticides," she 
advised, even if you haven't noticed a flea infestation yet. 
</P>
<P>
Health experts and veterinarians recommend yard pesticides with limited toxins, 
such as natural pyrethrins or synthetic products that duplicate pyrethrin. It 
also is better to spray lesser amounts more often. 
</P>
<P>
"Natural pyrethrins are a product of chrysanthemums, and the man-made ones are 
chemicals, but they're both very safe," said Dr. William Bender, a Granada 
Hills veterinarian who specializes in animal skin problems. "They can be used 
on dogs daily." 
</P>
<P>
Clear underbrush on your property "to make it inhospitable to rodents," said 
Van Gordon. "Remember that chain link fencing does nothing to keep out 
rodents." 
</P>
<P>
And limit access of food outdoors. "Don't leave the dog or cat food out until 
the next day," she said, explaining that opossums, which carry cat fleas, will 
live near a home once they discover pet food outside. 
</P>
<P>
Be advised that if your yard does become flea-infested, Van Gordon explained, 
"you are in violation of a portion of the (Los Angeles County) health code." 
</P>
<P>
If the health services department gets complaints about flea-infested 
properties, it sends owners a notice asking them to take care of the problem. 
If a second complaint is received, the county will inspect the property and 
serve notice, which can lead non-complying owners into hearings at the health 
services offices. Still no results? The case goes to the city attorney or 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
If fleas are in your yard, chances are they're in your home, too, living on 
your pet and in carpets or crevices of hardwood floors. Vacuuming your home two 
or three times a week can help keep down a small, inside flea population. But 
remember to dispose of the vacuum bag or cut up a flea collar to keep in the 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
There are many, many natural products, shampoos and sprays, in pet stores to 
keep fleas off your pets; some veterinarians now manufacture their own lines. 
"There are many good products on the market to deal with a flea problem, but 
you have to keep on top of it," said Carol McDonald of Bills' Tropical Imports, 
a Los Feliz pet shop. "There's a new one called Shield -- one formula for dogs 
and another for cats -- that we're using here." It has a polymer that "coats 
the fur so the fleas don't get on them." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dawn Curie Thomas of the Southern California Veterinary Hospital and Animal 
Skin Clinic in Woodland Hills developed her own line of natural products for 
dogs and cats -- Veterinarian's Best -- and is marketing it nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"I created them for my own clients because I just didn't want to have to use 
all those medications for the skin problems, especially cortisone and 
steroids," Thomas said. "I just knew there was a better way." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a member of the American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology, has 
developed a natural solution she calls Hot Spots, designed to soothe the common 
allergic reaction many cats and dogs have to fleas. 
</P>
<P>
For the home, there are many commercial flea bombs and sprays. But consumers 
should check out their contents and avoid those with "heavy" (petrocarbon) 
chemicals that might cause toxic reactions in animals or owners. Follow the 
directions carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental concerns about pesticides have led consumers to search for safe, 
natural ways to exterminate fleas. "People are becoming very educated," Bender 
said. "They come in here asking for safe things" to get rid of fleas. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Tallon, of Tallon Termite and Pest Control in Redondo Beach, the firm that 
developed the "blizzard" system to freeze rather than poison termites, 
observed: "Environmentally safe pest control is the wave of the future. People 
are more aware about these chemicals than they were 15 or 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Tallon has a non-chemical pilot program for ridding homes of fleas by dry 
steaming carpets -- at 250 degrees Fahrenheit -- then sprinkling rugs with an 
insect growth regulating powder, a synthetic hormone that interrupts the flea 
life cycle. Tallon calls it "birth control for fleas," and notes that it 
disrupts the life cycle of juvenile fleas, while the heat kills adult fleas. 
</P>
<P>
Steaming costs $245 for a 2,000-square-foot home, a follow-up visit $59.50. 
Tallon also offers home treatment with a citrus-based spray, ($145 for a 
2,000-square-foot home). A citrus-type yard spray is also available. 
</P>
<P>
"We get the consumers involved in what we're doing and educate them," Tallon 
said. "We make sure that they're doing their part. If they won't cooperate with 
us, our system won't work. We want them to pick up around the places where the 
cat lays or clean up outside where the dog is. Those are harboring areas for 
fleas." 
</P>
<P>
Another nontoxic, indoor approach to flea killing is offered by Fleabusters 
Inc., which guarantees customers a flea-free home for a year after a two-step 
patented powder process (which company representatives advise will not work in 
homes with hardwood floors). Its prices are based on the number of rooms; a 
carpeted, three-bedroom, living-dining room costs about $185 to treat.

CARING FOR CHILD SHOULDN'T PUT MARRIAGE IN JEOPARDY 
</P>

Raising a handicapped child can put enormous stress on a marriage. The biggest 
stress results from the constancy of the problem -- you never get time off from 
it. The child always has to struggle to overcome his handicap, so the parent is 
always on call. But there are ways to meet the child's needs without risking 
your marriage in the process. Jeanne Preble, a licensed marriage, family and 
child therapist who practices in Fullerton and Irvine, suggests: 
</P>
<P>
* Caring for a handicapped child should be a part of your life -- not your 
whole identity. A common problem is that one partner becomes completely 
involved in taking care of the child and the other gets mad because his or her 
spouse is no longer available. The marriage is lost in the process of caring 
for the child. Or one partner has trouble facing the responsibility and runs. 
Don't let the handicap run the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
* Your child may be handicapped, but that doesn't mean he or she is helpless. 
Handicapped children need to grow and change and move away from their parents 
just like everyone else. They need to be allowed to go through normal 
developmental stages. Letting go at the right time is important to your child 
and your marriage. 
</P>
<P>
* Take advantage of all the community resources available to help you and your 
child spend satisfying time away from each other. It's important for both 
parents and children to have their own circle of friends and their own 
activities. Then your handicapped child won't become too dependent on you -- 
and will have more opportunities to grow. 
</P>
<P>
* Caring for a handicapped child can be so tiring that you end up feeling 
resentful toward the child and have no energy left for the rest of your family. 
Get as much support as you can from family and friends, or join a support 
group, so you don't feel pressure 100% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
* Remember to put your marriage first. You need each other. SHERRY ANGEL

RAISING A DISABLED CHILD: THE STRESS -- AND REWARDS; 
</P>
<P>
THE ELSTRANS' BREAKUP IS NOT UNIQUE, BUT BOTH PARENTS HAVE SINCE GROWN FROM THE 
EXPERIENCE. AND TODAY MUFF ELSTRAN HAS A PARTICULARLY STRONG BOND WITH HER SON, 
NOW 14. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERRY ANGEL, Sherry Angel is a regular contributor to Orange County View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a doctor told Muff Elstran that her son, Will, was mentally retarded, she 
was so shaken she felt as if she had lost her arms and legs. But after she got 
over the shock, she looked at her son and said, "No way." 
</P>
<P>
When doctors told her that Will would never walk or see more than light and 
shadows, she didn't believe them either. 
</P>
<P>
And she was right. 
</P>
<P>
There was a lot she didn't know -- including the fact that the stresses of 
raising a handicapped child would eventually contribute to the breakup of her 
marriage. But from the time Will was born -- three months prematurely, weighing 
just 2 pounds, 5 ounces -- his mother believed in his chances of not only 
surviving but leading a happy, productive life. 
</P>
<P>
Today, although he struggles with multiple handicaps resulting from his 
premature birth, Will is a bright, inquisitive 14-year-old who sees well enough 
to read and not only walks but often runs because he is in such a hurry to 
enjoy life. 
</P>
<P>
And Muff is a 42-year-old single parent who has a special kind of closeness 
with her only child. She, more than anyone, has been able to break through 
Will's language and visual impairments and communicate with the boy the world 
would see if his handicaps didn't get in the way. 
</P>
<P>
Will is capable of comprehending as much as any average teen-ager, but because 
of his language problems, it takes him longer to process information and he's 
easily distracted. Muff often has to try several different ways of explaining 
something in order to reach him. 
</P>
<P>
He's completely blind in one eye and legally blind in the other and has trouble 
with fine motor skills, which makes it even harder for him to keep up with his 
peers, a number of whom have asked him if he is mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets real frustrated, but he does a great job of dealing with that," Muff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Often, when he's trying to grasp an idea, "the outside world doesn't wait," she 
noted. But she does. And she said the fact that Will needs more explanations 
about his universe than other children has brought them closer because "we talk 
about everything." 
</P>
<P>
Muff never expected motherhood to be such a challenge. While she was carrying 
Will and his twin, who died a week after birth, she nurtured the fantasy that 
she would eventually have at least nine children and make a career out of 
raising them. A handicapped child whose special needs would leave her no time 
or energy for other children was never part of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Neither was divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Her 10-year marriage ended in 1985, and she has since learned that she is one 
of many parents of handicapped children whose marriages have failed. 
</P>
<P>
Gladys Gleason, co-founder of the Speech and Language Development Center in 
Buena Park, where Will was a longtime student and Muff has worked for 10 years, 
estimates that only about 20% of the handicapped students served by the center 
live with both parents. The others come from broken homes, live with other 
family members or have been placed in foster homes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gleason, who is a marriage, family and child therapist and runs the center's 
counseling service, points out that the tremendous stress of having a 
handicapped child is especially hard on marriages when one or both spouses 
suffer from low self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," she said, "if a man is insecure, he might not be able to deal 
with a daily reminder that he has a handicapped child. He can't react to the 
child, so he reacts to his wife." 
</P>
<P>
Muff said the problems in her marriage to Tom Elstran were there from the start 
but didn't surface until after Will was born. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot more things to talk about with this kind of kid, and that wasn't 
always easy to do. That added a lot of stress," she explained during an 
interview at a Buena Park coffee shop where she smoked steadily and hardly 
touched her food. "I don't think we were good communicators from the beginning. 
Suddenly, a lot of things had to be covered. For a lot of years, I took his 
silence for agreement. We found that we had basic philosophical differences. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in changing and moving with new challenges, and he didn't see the 
need for so much change. I'm not saying I'm right and he's wrong, but those two 
philosophies don't make a smooth marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Tom, who lives about two miles from his ex-wife's Long Beach home and sees Will 
often, said his son's difficulties not only brought out the differences between 
him and his wife but also probably kept them together longer because they tried 
harder to make it work for Will's sake. 
</P>
<P>
Will spent the first nine months of his life in the hospital, including an 
uncertain six months in intensive care. Tom and Muff visited him every day. But 
they dealt with the crisis in very different ways. 
</P>
<P>
Tom turned inward and kept his feelings to himself. "I don't show a lot of 
emotion," he admitted in a phone interview arranged by his ex-wife. "That can 
be a problem. But I didn't go on the emotional roller coaster Muff did. It was 
easier for me to accept it and roll with it." 
</P>
<P>
Muff, an extrovert who is as loquacious and analytical as her ex-husband is 
quiet and logical, plunged into the high-tech world of medicine that was 
keeping her son alive, asking questions, pushing for comprehensible answers and 
resisting every gloomy prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
She also grieved. "I had to say goodby to the non-handicapped child I thought 
I'd have before I could accept the different bundle of joy I did have," she 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tom was struggling too. "It was the first time in my life I had lost 
control," he said. "I couldn't do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
Caring for the fragile baby they brought home from the hospital was a 
24-hour-a-day job for a while, and Muff, who had left her job as a fiscal 
manager for an aerospace firm, took charge. 
</P>
<P>
It was what she wanted to do, but she had little choice because Tom was working 
during the day and drinking heavily at night. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have to face the reality of the situation because he could drink 
until nothing mattered," Muff said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom -- who proudly notes that he is now a recovered alcoholic -- said that 
while he "fell in love with the bottle," Muff became completely immersed in her 
son's development, particularly after she enrolled him at the Speech and 
Language Development Center when he was 2 and then began working in an 
administrative job there full time. 
</P>
<P>
Muff admits that for a long time it was hard for her to have any conversation 
without discussing Will. But she doesn't believe Tom would have been ready to 
face their problems if she had shifted her focus to their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
When they finally parted -- long after the marriage had ended, they agree -- 
they were able to remain on friendly terms, and they continue to share a 
commitment to helping Will make the most of his life, Muff said. 
</P>
<P>
She and Will have grown closer since the divorce. They often go to movies 
together -- "Rain Man" is one of their favorites, and they always sit in the 
fourth row so Will can see -- and they share a love of blues music, which Will 
plays so well on his harmonica that people often ask him to perform. He and his 
mom are even taking guitar lessons together. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing how teachers at the Speech and Language Development Center deal with 
handicapped children has helped Muff resist the urge to be overprotective. "I 
try to be reasonably protective and at the same time push him to meet his 
potential," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Will, who now attends a public junior high school, seems to be doing just that. 
He has a girlfriend, also disabled, and hopes that he will soon be able to ride 
his bike to her house with help from the "mobility instructor" who is working 
with him on ways to overcome his visual handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes his sensitivity to his mother's feelings startles Muff. He senses 
when she's reached her limit, the point at which, she says, "I'll lose it if 
one more light bulb burns out." 
</P>
<P>
He'll say, "Mom, can I do something for you?" Or he'll rub her shoulders. And 
that helps her to take a deep breath and put her problems in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm lucky," she said. "I have a house and a job, and I'm doing a good job of 
getting through every day -- and having a good time doing it. And I've got a 
great kid with whom I have a terrific relationship."

DISCOVERY: APOLLO BOOK STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rizzoli, it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
There are no clearly delineated aisles, no bright signs telling people what 
subject is in what row, no window display of new releases. 
</P>
<P>
The books at Apollo Book Store in Costa Mesa are stacked on the floor with no 
seeming rhyme or reason, magazines commingle with hardback books, and 
newspapers are found in a variety of spots. 
</P>
<P>
But there are many diamonds in the rough to be found, as Apollo keeps its 
inventory up to date with rare and out-of-print books and first editions. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of browsers," said Mary-Alice Currie, who owns the store with her 
husband, James L. (Lindy) Currie. 
</P>
<P>
"Nautical books are our specialty, voyaging and things that pertain to the 
ocean and the sea. We also have a lot of books on Western Americana. Come to 
think of it, we have used books on every conceivable subject." 
</P>
<P>
Back issues of general-interest magazines like Life are also available at the 
store, as well as others covering a variety of topics, including cars, boating, 
art and architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The store has been at its same location on 18th Street for 29 years, but, 
unfortunately, it won't see its 30th year there. Currie said they recently got 
a notice to vacate the site. Their landlord plans to tear down the building 
that houses Apollo and build anew. 
</P>
<P>
"We will close sometime around mid-September," Currie said. "We're looking for 
other sites, but if we don't find one soon we might become mail-order only." 
</P>
<P>
With the impending closure, Apollo has stopped buying most used books and 
magazines, with an eye toward moving its mammoth inventory. 
</P>
<P>
Currie said there are "thousands, if not tens of thousands" of books, magazines 
and newspapers in the store. "We don't keep a number on inventory." 
</P>
<P>
The pricing system is based on the research they do on the availability of the 
book or magazine, Currie said. 
</P>
<P>
"Age is not necessarily the criterion we use," she said. "If there weren't very 
many printed or a lot of things available on the particular subject it covers, 
the price will be more." 
</P>
<P>
Hardback books generally run in the $6 to $20 range, while magazines are a few 
dollars less. 
</P>
<P>
The store also sells Sunday editions of out-of-town newspapers from 18 U.S. 
cities, Currie said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people buy them if they are planning to move soon, to scan the classified 
ads, for housing and such," Currie said. "Seattle's (paper) has been a big 
seller for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
So if you're going to browse at Apollo, do it soon. There are only a handful of 
diamond-hunting days left. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday-Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday 
</P>
<P>
Address: 545 W. 18th St., Costa Mesa

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: HEART MEDICATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My father is taking nitroglycerin for angina. I know that it's been 
around a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't there anything newer and better? New drugs are being developed every day. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Medication must be determined by the patient's own physician. I have no 
basis for saying that one medication is better than another for a patient I 
have never seen. 
</P>
<P>
Having said that, I should add that nitroglycerin is a preferred medication for 
many patients with stable angina pectoris. A patient can take it after symptoms 
develop, or as a preventive. Moreover, side effects associated with 
nitroglycerin, for the most part, are acceptable. Another advantage is that the 
drug is inexpensive.

<P>
THEATER: LIBBE S. HALEVY'S PLAY, COMING TO ORANGE COUNTY, FOLLOWS SEVEN MEN AND 
WOMEN, ALL CHILDHOOD VICTIMS OF INCEST, IN THEIR BIDS TO DEAL WITH THE CRIME'S 
PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS.

<P>
Oh, the secrets of childhood. A crush on the new girl in class, a peek at a 
yet-to-be-wrapped Christmas gift, those warm, delicious confidences you shared 
only with your best friend on the condition he would "cross his heart, hope to 
die," and never, ever tell. 
</P>
<P>
Charming? Yes. Unless that secret is incest. 
</P>
<P>
"Shattered Secrets," a play by Libbe S. HaLevy, follows seven men and women, 
all childhood victims of incest, in their attempts to deal with the crime's 
psychological effects. Now in its second year at the Powerhouse Theatre in 
Venice, the show will be presented Thursday at Rancho Santiago College in Santa 
Ana and Aug. 24 at the Costa Mesa Neighborhood Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Secrets" has been produced and directed by Jerry Craig, founder and artistic 
director of the Hispanic Theatre Project, a Los Angeles-based, multiracial 
troupe. The show's seven-member cast includes actors from the Hispanic Theatre 
Project and We Tell Stories, a touring group that normally presents children's 
plays at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County performances of "Secrets" are being sponsored by Adult 
Survivors of Child Abuse Co-Dependency Centers in Bellflower, which coordinates 
therapy groups, referral programs and inpatient treatment for "adult survivors 
of dysfunctional families," said the director of program development for the 
centers, Jenny Francis. The group also operates programs in Long Beach, 
Fountain Valley and Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Incest is a topic most people would like to avoid. But the numbers are hard to 
ignore. In a 1985 Los Angeles Times poll, 27% of the women respondents and 16% 
of the men -- an overall average of 22% of the population -- reported that they 
had suffered some form of sexual abuse as children. In Orange County, there 
were 676 reported cases of sexual abuse to children younger than 18 during June 
alone, according to figures compiled by the Orange County Child Abuse Registry. 
</P>
<P>
But it's an especially tough subject for Craig, himself a childhood victim of 
incest. 
</P>
<P>
"When Libbe sent me this script, she had attached a note that said it dealt 
with incest," Craig recalled. "That affected me so strongly, it took two months 
before I could read it. Every time I saw the word, my stomach would start to 
churn. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I finally did read it, my artistic sensibility took over, and I 
recognized this was a play that had to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
"Secrets" unfolds during a meeting of Incest Anonymous, a fictional 12-step 
recovery program. There's a diverse group assembled: Sylvia, a middle-aged 
career woman (played by Bibi Besch, best known for her current film role as 
Molly Ringwald's future mother-in-law in "Betsy's Wedding"); Gary, a bisexual 
street hustler; Akashi, the "group basket case"; newcomer Tom; Caroline, a 
Jewish lesbian; Elizabeth, the veteran of the group, and Carlos, a 
Mexican-American who exhibits multiple personalities. During the course of the 
meeting, all tell their stories while trading equal measures of comfort and 
wisecracks. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County shows mark the 15th time "Secrets" has traveled beyond the 
stage of the Powerhouse. The play was presented for two consecutive years at 
the Governor's Conference on Crime Victims. Two unrelated productions are also 
in the works: one in Berkeley and a German translation, which will open later 
this summer in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter or in what language it is seen, Craig said he hopes that 
"Secrets" audiences will go away with an increased sensitivity to the cause and 
effects of incest. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, when we look at people with problems like drug problems or 
prostitution, we're just seeing the symptoms of the true problem, which is 
incest," Craig said. "We hope that in the end, (the play) will help create a 
climate that will be safe for people to come out and deal with this problem 
publicly."

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW;

<P>
LEWIS' FLIGHT OF FANCY IS UNMAGICALLY GROUNDED

<P>
Anyone who loves the Narnia Chronicles of C.S. Lewis may be pleased to find a 
staged version of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" playing in so charming 
a theater as La Habra's Depot Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Guiding us into Lewis' deep, magical forest of imagery and allegory are 27 
children large and small, but mostly small, picturesquely costumed by Ambra 
Wakefield in wonderful make-up by Tim Turner. 
</P>
<P>
The journey is an ambitious undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
But the production design by Bob Schaffer is decidedly unmagical and threatens 
to grind the whole flight of fancy into so much drudgery. 
</P>
<P>
The story has been telescoped into a dizzying progression of short scenes (13 
in the first act alone, which ran under 45 minutes), each, it seems, in a 
different locale. The turntable set is forever going round and round while 
shadowy (and mostly small) figures lug large and heavy stage pieces on and off. 
</P>
<P>
Also troublesome are some choices by director Geoffrey Gread that condescend to 
children's theater. Why are the actors pretending to eat large plastic fruit, 
including a gourd? Why is the majestic Aslan the lion introduced through a side 
door and forced to shimmy around a table before he can plant his big, furry 
feet? Tim Turner, as Aslan, never has a chance after that entrance to live up 
to his dangerous reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The children's parts are handled by two casts who alternate performances. Of 
the company that played Sunday, Carrie Payne, as the White Witch, manages to be 
both dangerous and regal, and John Leary's Edmund is exceptionally believable. 
Curtis Wilkinson and Andrea Bodell are a very engaging couple of beavers. 
</P>
<P>
An acquaintance with Lewis' book is helpful both to follow the action and to 
provide the deep magic of imagination so necessary for entrance into enchanted 
lands.

ARRANGEMENTS BY O.C.'S TOM KUBIS ENERGIZE SOLOISTS

<P>
George Graham didn't take any solos at downtown Los Angeles' Grand Avenue Bar 
on Monday night, but -- for the first set, at least -- he was the most valuable 
musician on stage. 
</P>
<P>
When freeway gridlock delayed two of the trumpet players in the Tom Kubis big 
band, lead trumpeter Graham suddenly found himself leading a two-man, rather 
than the usual four-man, section. Without blinking an eye (or tightening his 
lip) Graham steamed ahead on Kubis' powerful charts, firing out impassioned 
high-note trumpet lines. Except for a few odd closing notes here and there, 
Graham's playing masterfully compensated for the other missing parts. 
</P>
<P>
Kubis, a veteran tenor saxophonist, composer and teacher at Golden West College 
in Huntington Beach, has been working his band mostly in the Orange County area 
with a rotating group of personnel. His charts -- which frequently use standard 
chord changes and playful name variations ("Purple Porpoise Parkway" for "Green 
Dolphin Street" is a good example) -- are crisp and swinging. Written from a 
horn player's point of view, they flow with tremendous urgency and drive. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the opening set was a romping excursion through Kubis' "Samba 
Dees Godda Do It," with wildly exploratory solos by Clay Jenkins on trumpet and 
Mike Fahn on trombone. Typically, the soloists were energized by the surging 
ensemble passages of Kubis' arrangement, which -- as in all his charts -- 
superbly linked written passages with improvised solos. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as good was a ballad, "Just a Pretty Little Thing," with a thoughtful 
fluegelhorn solo by Dan McGurn, and the hard-driving (and whimsically titled) 
"Exactly Like This." 
</P>
<P>
By this time, the trumpet section had filled out, and Graham's stalwart lead 
work had saved the evening. It was to his credit, as well as to the finely 
crafted Kubis arrangements, that a potentially problematic situation turned out 
to be one more example of the way in which good music, and good jazz, can 
prevail.

ROTHENBERG CONSIDERS RUNNING FOR SOCCER FEDERATION PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Rothenberg, who as soccer commissioner for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics 
oversaw one of the Games' best-attended events, said Tuesday that he is 
considering running for president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, apparently at 
the prompting of international soccer officials concerned about the 1994 World 
Cup to be held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, a former president of the Clippers and now the president of the 
California State Bar Assn., said he has been urged to run for the soccer 
position by officials at FIFA, soccer's international governing body. 
</P>
<P>
"FIFA people have been talking to me all along -- before, during and after the 
World Cup in Italy," Rothenberg said. "People involved in both the 
international and domestic soccer scene have been asking me to step in and make 
sure that '94 comes off properly. People are concerned that the legacy after 
'94 will be that soccer will be a hit on all levels in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, Rothenberg was part-owner of the Los Angeles Aztecs, a North 
American Soccer League franchise that drew well and had moderate success. He 
was also involved with perhaps the last successful large-scale international 
soccer event in this country -- the '84 Olympics. The matches at the Rose Bowl 
drew crowds of 100,000-plus. Scott LeTellier, president of the 1994 World Cup 
Organizing Committee, briefly worked under Rothenberg in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Werner Fricker, the current USSF president, is also the chairman of the board 
of the 1994 Organizing Committee. Fricker, in his third term as president, has 
said he will run for reelection. Also announced as a candidate is Paul Stiehl, 
the USSF treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
The election for the president will be held Aug. 5 during the federation's 
annual meetings at Orlando, Fla. The term will be for four years. The USSF 
president will have considerable input into the 1994 World Cup organization. 
</P>
<P>
Stiehl said Tuesday that he didn't know anything about Rothenberg and that with 
only two weeks to go before the vote, Rothenberg would have a difficult time 
being accepted by soccer's rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of any expertise he has in the game of soccer," Stiehl said from 
his office in Beltsville, Md. "He will be seen as an outsider; he will be seen 
as an opportunist, as an expert there to tell us how to run our sport. The 
question will be, 'What have you done for the game?' Quite frankly, no one will 
be impressed with the (title of) commissioner of the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
If Rothenberg were to gain the presidency, it would appear to give a boost to 
L.A.'s chances of holding the World Cup final. Rothenberg said he well 
remembered sitting with FIFA officials, viewing the large, enthusiastic crowds 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been my assumption that when push came to shove, they (FIFA 
officials) would pick Los Angeles because it's been proven here," Rothenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, FIFA officials have reportedly been concerned about the reduced 
potential for success of the 1994 World Cup, after dismal U.S. television 
ratings for the recent World Cup in Italy indicated that the American public 
has only lukewarm interest in what is generally considered to be the world's 
biggest sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that FIFA is very disenchanted with the operation of the 
federation at this point," Stiehl said. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, 51, indicated that if he were elected, he would want full control 
of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't run unless it's clear that I have proper support and it won't be just 
a job of placating factions," he said. "I'm less afraid of losing than of 
winning and not having things done the way I want them to be." 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg said his term as president of the State Bar Assn. would expire in 
August.

PENALTIES ARE DEFENDED BY MEMBERS OF '77 BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arthur Reynolds, 75, and semi-retired after 15 years as dean of the graduate 
school at the University of Northern Colorado, hasn't served on the NCAA 
Committee on Infractions in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
He long ago destroyed his boxes of notes from the cases the committee handled 
while he was on it -- security reasons, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But last Friday, a Federal Express package from the NCAA arrived at his 
Greeley, Colo., home bearing news guaranteed to cause flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The package contained the current Committee on Infractions' report on its 
recent review of the NCAA's 1977 infractions case against the University of 
Nevada Las Vegas basketball program, the case that sparked UNLV Coach Jerry 
Tarkanian's 13-year court battle with the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding to bar the Rebels from the next NCAA tournament, the committee has 
stirred up a hornet's nest in Las Vegas, where Tarkanian and school officials 
have branded the penalty too severe and announced plans to appeal the ruling to 
the NCAA Council. 
</P>
<P>
But in making such a decision, the committee has stood up for the thinking of 
Reynolds and the four other men who, while serving on the committee in 1977, 
ordered UNLV to suspend Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because there has been 13 years of litigation instituted by the head 
coach, I do not see why you have to say, 'Let bygones be bygones,' or, 'These 
kids (current UNLV players) were 7 or 8 years old when all this happened,' 
"said Reynolds, who was chairman of the Committee on Infractions in 1977. "I 
hate to think that's how you can ease out of a penalty, by going to court. In 
regular cases of civil or criminal action, so often if you let enough time 
lapse, people forget the details. I'm glad they (the current committee) didn't 
let that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Cross, a former University of Washington law professor who also served on 
the committee in 1977, said he is sympathetic toward those who say the current 
committee's ruling unfairly penalizes players who were in elementary school 
when the case was first heard. But he said he sees no way around such a 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult thing, but, according to the NCAA structure, if violations 
are (documented), an institution has to respond," he said. "I suppose that, in 
some respects, even the fastest response impacts on athletes who weren't much 
involved. This (last Friday's ruling) is just an aggravated instance of that. 
The reaction from current (UNLV) athletes I see in the paper is understandable. 
But I don't see any way to avoid what has happened." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he feels vindicated by the current committee's action, Cross said: 
"Yes. . . . The current action, which, in a sense, showed that something more 
needed to be done, was reassuring." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, no NCAA infractions case can match the '77 UNLV case for 
contentiousness. 
</P>
<P>
After more than 26 hours of hearings, the Committee on Infractions placed UNLV 
on two years' probation with sanctions that included no appearances in 
postseason competition or on television for two years. In addition, the NCAA 
ordered UNLV to suspend Tarkanian for two years or "show cause" why additional 
penalties should not be imposed on the school. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 38 violations cited by the NCAA, 10 involved Tarkanian directly. The 
most serious dealt with Tarkanian's role in trying to encourage a key source 
for the NCAA, a former UNLV player named Jeep Kelley, to lie to NCAA 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that the NCAA used questionable tactics and that he successfully 
refuted the charges, Tarkanian obtained injunctions in District Court in Las 
Vegas preventing UNLV from taking any action against him. 
</P>
<P>
As these events unfolded, members of the Committee on Infractions were caught 
in a spotlight they normally would have shunned. They were called before a 
Congressional subcommittee that looked into NCAA enforcement procedures, and 
they were called to testify in court in the Tarkanian case. 
</P>
<P>
None of the men who served on that committee remain active in NCAA affairs. 
Still, wounds linger from the UNLV case. 
</P>
<P>
One committee member from that era, John Sawyer, a retired Wake Forest 
University math professor, did not want to talk about the case when contacted 
by The Times this week. "To be perfectly frank, I've had some unfortunate 
experiences going public in the past," he said. Pressed on the matter, he said, 
"Some lawyers have called me -- lawyers from Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
The case eventually was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled, 5-4, in 
favor of the NCAA in December of 1988. And last March, both sides agreed to a 
lower court order that allowed Tarkanian's injunction against UNLV to stand but 
lifted an injunction against the NCAA, allowing the current Committee on 
Infractions to rule on the 1977 "show cause" order. 
</P>
<P>
The committee based part of its justification for banning the Rebels from 
postseason play -- a move that, if upheld, would prevent them from defending 
their national championship -- on the fact that the order to suspend Tarkanian 
was central to the '77 penalty, a notion that Reynolds strongly endorses. 
</P>
<P>
"We did feel a major thing was to get that coach out of his head coaching 
position, completely and in all ways, for a period of two years," he said. "The 
other (penalties) were routine types of things. But we felt the head coach's 
participation (in the alleged improprieties) were so serious and direct that it 
was appropriate to tell the university to sever its relationship with that head 
coach or else 'show cause' why additional penalties shouldn't be assessed." 
</P>
<P>
As for Tarkanian's view that the facts didn't support the charges against him, 
Reynolds said: "The Jeep Kelley thing, there was much controversy over the 
contact between that student-athlete and the coach. But from the data the 
committee reviewed, we felt there had been an attempt to hide data on the part 
of the coach." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cross: "I've never been unhappy with what happened at Las Vegas. I thought 
the appraisal of how Coach Tarkanian conducted himself by the committee was 
sound." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Cross, 77, and in retirement in Seattle, admitted that he felt a 
twinge of cynicism when he opened his Federal Express package from the NCAA 
last Friday and read the current committee's decision on the '77 case. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'This seems reasonable, "' he said. "But I also thought, 'How are 
they going to make it work this time?' "

WHAT HAPPENS ON FIELD STILL THE THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY KORNHEISER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last week was a miserable week in sports: Pete Rose, once the poster boy of 
baseball's renaissance, was sentenced to jail for tax evasion. A transcript of 
George Steinbrenner's hearing before Fay Vincent revealed a desperate, cowering 
man willing to throw everybody off the bus to save his well-heeled behind. The 
Redskins' Ricky Sanders was charged with attempted murder and had to make bail 
before going to training camp. The NCAA finally wrapped its arms around Jerry 
Tarkanian after a 13-year wait, but Tark won't suffer a loss of income or fame. 
</P>
<P>
Indefensibly, players on this year's UNLV team -- who were 7 and 8 years old 
when Tark was first caught -- are the ones who actually will be punished. Tark 
himself may soon tumble if the NCAA finds him dirty on the recruitment of Lloyd 
Daniels, a basketball vagabond of dubious academic merit. Cleveland State 
basketball coach Kevin Mackey was fired soon after police caught him coming out 
of a drug house with a woman who was not his wife. And in Pittsburgh, a leering 
slug of a TV producer sought to hire sportscaster Karie Ross to co-host "The 
Bubby Brister Show" to guarantee the "undertone of sexual nuance on this show. 
We want sparks to fly. Bubby has a reputation as a ladies' man, and she's hot 
looking." God help us. 
</P>
<P>
Where do we start? 
</P>
<P>
Or do we just throw our heads back and scream? 
</P>
<P>
All this in ONE WEEK. The Sanders incident recalls recent troubles for the 
Redskins: Dexter Manley's disheartening relapse; Barry Wilburn's problems with 
drugs and alcohol; Mark May's successive drunk-driving episodes. In the past 
Joe Gibbs has brushed aside inopportune behavior with the hopeful thought, "We 
think it's a one-time kind of thing." Let's hope it's a one-time thing with 
Sanders, since the charge is attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Provoking sexual heat between Brister and Ross on the air cuts a little too 
close to home, given the limousine event in a Georgetown alley. Tarkanian's ill 
wind echoes Bob Wade's, and sets a long, discouraging chain in motion back to 
Len Bias. And these are just local recollections; they don't encompass the more 
notorious exhibitions of recent years: baseball's drug trial; an escalation of 
assaults among college and pro football players; a steroid epidemic; the symbol 
of corruption in recruiting -- $100 bills popping out of an overnight mail 
pouch. 
</P>
<P>
Scandal in sports is an old story. However, we're struck by this avalanche in 
such a short time. There's a temptation to try and find a common denominator. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Rose, Steinbrenner and Tarkanian it would be greed. Rose's 
unrelenting greed -- not just for money, but for records and acclaim -- was his 
fatal flaw; his self-destruction mirrors Shakespearian tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's greed was for power. Why else would he break baseball's rules to 
pay $40,000 to a known gambler for damaging information on Dave Winfield if not 
for the power it transferred? (While this slam-dance on Steinbrenner continues, 
it seems incumbent to point out that he wasn't always a villain. When he bought 
the Yankees they were cadaverous, drawing as few as 3,000 people a game. Not 
coincidentally, baseball was at ebb tide, being eclipsed by the NFL. He was 
awed by New York, as only an out-of-towner can be, and he appreciated how the 
fortunes of the Yankees and baseball were intertwined. When he resurrected the 
Yankees, they became the rising tide that floats all boats.) Tarkanian was 
greedy in the way most coaches are, for wins. The big money that television 
pumped into college sports ensures that the more games you win the more money 
you'll earn. But coaches cheated before the big money. 
</P>
<P>
Greed won't explain the sex and violence; that brand of self-indulgence is 
apparently rooted in an athlete's sense of entitlement. We jack these people up 
so high, and start so young, they quickly learn to be devoted to nothing but 
their athletics. As they get older, and grow accustomed to people bending rules 
to accommodate them, they begin to believe they really are above the law. Since 
people keep throwing money, sex and other perks at them, why should they think 
any differently? They are, by and large, a tribe without conscience. 
</P>
<P>
Romantics like to say everything was better in the old days -- that people had 
better values then. Values are just as good now, but fewer people share them. 
More people did cheat in the '80s; the S&amp;L scandal is the interest on a 
decade of class warfare under pro-rich presidents. The attitude of the '80s was 
amoral: I'm going to do wrong, and you're going to have to catch me. Avarice 
and entitlement have become an oil spill, spreading to sports, polluting the 
last beach of the culture. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of contrition is shocking. Arrogant throughout, Rose didn't say he was 
sorry until the day he was sentenced to prison. Steinbrenner hasn't said it 
yet. Capitals' players never apologized for the shameful act of gang-sex with a 
girl of 17, just for the inconvenience the investigation caused. Kevin Mackey 
self-righteously berated the world, praising his own high moral stance, then 
after he was arrested admitted he'd had drug and alcohol problems for years. 
Tarkanian rails about how the NCAA is out to get him. A disturbingly common 
quote now from athletes is: "My lawyer has advised me not to comment." 
</P>
<P>
Yet with each new scandal, we flinch, but never truly turn away. Baseball is 
thriving despite Rose and Steinbrenner. College basketball is more popular than 
ever despite probations at Kansas and Kentucky, and the melodrama that was Jim 
Valvano. The Redskins will sell out every home game, their players will be 
adored. The Capitals will hardly feel a dent. 
</P>
<P>
The American people are buying tickets and watching sports on TV in record, 
massive numbers. Because no matter how sullied sports are, we still see them as 
an escape. The games remain pure in the fan's heart, and gentle on the fan's 
forgiving mind.

DODGERS PAVE THE WAY FOR MARTINEZ; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: PITCHER GIVES UP TWO HITS IN 9-2 WIN OVER THE GIANTS. SAMUEL HITS 
THREE-RUN HOMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There are still two months and many pitches left. But what was previously an 
idle thought has become a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez, Cy Young Award candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger pitcher gave up a 20-foot hit to the first batter of the game 
Tuesday . . . and then allowed only one more hit during a 9-2 victory over the 
San Francisco Giants before 39,279 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In helping the Dodgers reach the .500 mark at 47-47 for the first time since 
June 25, Martinez threw the low-hit game of his career and struck out eight to 
increase his major-league leading total to 150. 
</P>
<P>
The only runs he allowed were caused by two eighth-inning errors by shortstop 
Jose Vizcaino, who missed a tag at second base on a double-play attempt, and 
then missed a ground ball. An unearned run scored on the botched grounder, and 
then Brett Butler's fly ball scored the other unearned run. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Martinez was close to perfect after allowing a leadoff bunt single 
to Butler. He retired the next 17 hitters before Juan Samuel muffed a grounder 
in the sixth inning for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez then retired the next four hitters before walking Mark Leonard on four 
pitches to start the eighth-inning mess. The second hit against Martinez came 
with one out in the ninth on a ground ball hit by Kevin Mitchell that bounced 
by Vizcaino and into left field. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had 10 hits, included two big ones that made Giant Manager Roger 
Craig cringe. A two-run single by Hubie Brooks and a two-run double by Mike 
Scioscia both came after intentional walks loaded the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks' hit gave the Dodgers a 2-0 first-inning lead against loser John Burkett 
that they never lost. Scioscia's hit started a five-run seventh inning against 
Ed Vosberg that was capped by Samuel's three-run homer, his eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' involvement in a pennant race may still be a dream even though 
they moved to within 1 1/2 games of the second-place Giants and 12 1/2 of the 
National League West-leading Cincinnnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
But Martinez has become a contender in his own race -- for Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
The early favorite, Frank Viola of the New York Mets, has failed three times to 
win his 14th game. He is 13-5 with a 2.43 ERA and 103 strikeouts in 141 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Another top candidate, Jack Armstrong of the Cincinnati Reds, was pounded for 
seven runs in 4 2/3 innings by the San Diego Padres Tuesday and is 11-6 with a 
3.08 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is 12-4 with 2.77 ERA. He not only leads the league in strikeouts, but 
in complete games with seven, and is tied for second with three shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
And there's more, such as, he wins big games. Martinez is 6-0 against the West 
Division. Six times he has won a game following a Dodger loss. The Dodgers are 
11-1 in games during which he goes seven or more innings. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's starter for the Giants, Burkett, is another bright young pitcher like 
Monday's starter Trevor Wilson. He entered the game with just two losses in 17 
starts, plus nine wins to complement a 3.53 earned-run average. And earlier 
this season, making his 1990 debut in Dodgeer Stadium, he allowed just two runs 
in seven innings 
</P>
<P>
But this time, like his counterpart Wilson, he didn't fool the Dodgers for a 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the first inning, Kirk Gibson lofted a single to center field. 
Gibson has hit safely in 16 of his last 20 games. Kal Daniels then increased 
his hitting streak to six games with a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson hustled to third, forcing a throw from center fielder Brett Butler. The 
ball bounced wildly past third base, allowing Brooks to move to second and 
giving Butler just his third error of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray was then intentionally walked to load the bases, an unusual move 
in the first innning. Brooks then showed what he thought of it by lining a 
single to right field, scoring Gibson and Daniels while extending his hitting 
streak to eight games. In eight at-bats with the bases loaded this season, 
Brooks is batting .428, with eight RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's bar fight will apparently cost Alfredo Griffin a week of games. 
Griffin's scratched and swollen left eye was diagnosed as having no permanent 
damage by Dr. Matthew Bernstein, but because of reaction to medication, he will 
miss at least the next three days. He might not even return to the team until 
next Monday, when he will be re-examined by Bernstein. Wilson Sturgeon Jr., the 
Pittsburgh busboy who was allegedly assaulted by Griffin and Juan Samuel 
Saturday morning, said he will meet with his lawyer today to discuss the filing 
of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark, the Giants' first baseman, missed a second consecutive start 
because of a sore right foot, but he was available to pinch-hit. Clark was 
hitting a career .462 against Dodger starter Ramon Martinez. . . . The Dodgers' 
first-round jinx has struck pitcher Ron Walden, their top pick in the recent 
June draft. After making three starts for Great Falls in the Pioneer rookie 
league, Walden has developed a tender elbow and will miss what officials are 
calling "a few" starts. League sources confirm that Walden, taken ninth 
overall, was rated as the No. 2 high school pitcher in the draft but was passed 
by other teams because doctors said he will require shoulder surgery within a 
couple of years. Last year's top draft pick, Kiki Jones, has pitched only nine 
games for Class-A Bakersfield this season because a sore shoulder. The 1988 top 
draft pick, Bill Bene, has pitched in only 12 games for Class-A Vero Beach with 
a sore shoulder. The 1987 top pick, Dan Opperman of double-A San Antonio, is 
participating in his first full season because of elbow trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Don Aase, who threw in the bullpen again without pain, will appear in his first 
simulated game at the end of this week. He could be ready to return to the team 
within a couple of weeks.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On nights when Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez defends his World Boxing Council 
light-flyweight championship, you can forget the adage, "The bigger they are, 
the harder they fall." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lim Jung Keun, who weighed in at 107 1/2 pounds, fell hard late in the fourth 
round Monday night at the Forum. The courageous Korean challenger got up but 
was saved from further punishment when the referee stopped the fight in the 
next round. The Gonzalez knockout meter: 22 in 28 professional bouts, after 19 
in 23 amateur bouts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The unbeaten Gonzalez bears a facial resemblance to Herve Villechaize from 
"Fantasy Island" and isn't terribly much bigger, but you would not want to meet 
up with him in a dark alley or a well-lighted ring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
He is the latest in a long line of bombers from Mexico to seek fame and fortune 
north of the border. When featherweight Ricardo (Pajarito) Moreno sold out the 
Hollywood Legion Stadium in the late 1950s, fans unable to buy tickets smashed 
windows and climbed into the building. Later, bantamweight Ruben Olivares 
turned 'em away at the Forum, and so did welterweight Pipino Cuevas at the 
Sports Arena and the Olympic Auditorium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
They're not knocking down doors or breaking windows yet for Gonzalez, but the 
crowd of 7,187 was good for a locally televised card, and it was almost like 
old times at the Forum when George Parnassus was promoter. Three national 
anthems were sung, a fight broke out at ringside, and the Mexican hero got a 
victory ride up the aisle on the shoulders of his countrymen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest fights of 1991 could be Gonzalez vs. Michael Carbajal, who 
has become a network star since losing a controversial decision in the 1988 
Olympic Games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' new look next season will include the familiar face of Bill 
Sharman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sharman, who has served the franchise as coach, general manager and president, 
will return as a special consultant after a two-year absence. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He may do some scouting, but his focus will be on our team," General Manager 
Jerry West said. "More than anything else, we want him to give us another look 
at ourselves. He'll provide us with some expert opinion." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall is about to be traded by the New York Mets to Baltimore or 
Boston. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Nolan Ryan wins his 300th game tonight, he will be the second former Met to 
have done it against the New York Yankees. Tom Seaver was with the Chicago 
White Sox when he accomplished the feat at Yankee Stadium in 1985. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The biggest mistake Angel owner Gene Autry ever made was allowing the Houston 
Astros to sign Ryan as a free agent on Nov. 19, 1979, after victory No. 167. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Padres haven't been the same since catcher Benito Santiago was 
injured. . . . Steve Wynn of the Mirage hotel in Las Vegas is courting George 
Foreman and Julio Cesar Chavez. . . . 
</P>
<P>
News item: Jay Lawrence, who covers the Raiders for the Orange County Register 
and soon will move to Denver to cover the Broncos for the Rocky Mountain News, 
is treated like an out-of-town reporter and barred from Raider practice 
sessions in Oxnard. Reaction: Out-of-what-town? . . . 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that a TV movie on three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond is 
being developed for ABC by producer Larry Lyttle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs up to the Nevada Las Vegas basketball players who have asked an attorney 
to try to overturn the NCAA ruling making them ineligible to defend their 
national title. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the chart showing how few NBA and NFL draftees have graduated is 
hot and heavy. UCLA is proud of its "Final Score" program. More than 100 former 
student-athletes have returned to school and earned their degrees since 1984. 
And USC reports that 15 of the 17 seniors on the football team are on schedule 
to graduate on time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Before he was put on waivers by the British Columbia Lions, an out-of-shape 
Mark Gastineau was being called Gasp-ineau. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How about a match race between Leroy Burrell and Ben Johnson? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trainer George (Mother) Menefee, one of the most popular members of the Rams' 
organization, will be honored at halftime of the Ram-Charger exhibition game on 
Aug. 18 at Anaheim Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Junior Chamber of Commerce and the L.A. Sports Council are 
trying to put together a four-team college basketball tournament for 1991 or 
'92 at the Sports Arena or the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What Goodwill? First there was the Alonzo Mourning-Jose Ortiz altercation in 
the United States-Puerto Rico basketball game, and now word filters down from 
Seattle that Ted Turner and Jane Fonda engaged in a shouting match at the 
Goodwill Games.

MELVIN DURSLAG: RAIDERS IN SHADE WHEN IT COMES TO LEGAL HEAT

<P>
It is a normal training camp for the Raiders, if you are willing to overlook 
that they aren't sure where they will be playing and, if it happens to be Los 
Angeles, how it will feel entertaining in a stadium devoid of viewers. 
</P>
<P>
They also aren't sure who will be performing at quarterback, but in the context 
of other crises, this is a manageable problem. 
</P>
<P>
It happened for eight years during training camp that the Raiders found 
themselves in litigation, engaged all at once in as many as five cases. 
</P>
<P>
Down to one this year, the Raiders are breezing. They are being sued for $58 
million by an old confederate, the Los Angeles Coliseum, claiming breach of 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Following blocks applied by the Raiders, the Coliseum raced to $29 million in 
loot, the cash lifted from the NFL in an antitrust action. 
</P>
<P>
Up until then, the Coliseum was noted for its lack of funds, leading the 
Raiders today to look upon this body with the rawest contempt, suing the ally 
that made it fat. 
</P>
<P>
Yet as training proceeds in this seaside village, the Yank at Oxnard, Al Davis, 
is engaged in contract conversations with the Coliseum, where his current lease 
expires at the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
He also is having discussions with Oakland and Sacramento, but not at this 
point with St. Louis, Baltimore, Jacksonville or Memphis. All are eager to 
offer refuge to Al, not to savor his courtly charm, but because he has a team 
and those cities don't. 
</P>
<P>
In order to land the Raiders, a city must offer as a foremost qualification a 
class restaurant that serves dinner beyond 10 o'clock. 
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Oakland, Davis, who dines late, dealt with two 
establishments that would keep the kitchen open until he arrived. It's great to 
be a winner. 
</P>
<P>
But both have since changed hands, meaning in Oakland today Al would have his 
choice of palaces purveying pizza, or of installing a hot plate in his office. 
</P>
<P>
Neither is satisfactory, jeopardizing negotiations with Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the Raiders remain the only team in the NFL residing in a hotel 
during training camp. While they are quartered amid everyday comforts at the 
Radisson here, others in the league are on safari, occupying dorms. 
</P>
<P>
"A place that doesn't have room service will never get my team, or me," Davis 
once said. Which, of course, would affirm today that the Raiders might have 
lost money, but not their style. 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing incredible events of the last decade, you find that the Raiders 
fought bitterly in court to trade Oakland for Los Angeles, a logical swap at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
Then, winning the right to move to Los Angeles, the Raiders would choose to 
move out, finding the venture in L.A. a colossal bust. 
</P>
<P>
They claimed a double-cross on the part of their landlord, and the landlord 
charged over-negotiation on the part of the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The old adversary, Oakland, suddenly reappears, agreeing to a $600-million 
package for the return of the team to the loving precincts of East Bay. 
</P>
<P>
But poised to snatch this treasure, the Raiders are foiled dramatically by 
vigilantes unappreciative of their art. 
</P>
<P>
You pictured a guy tunneling patiently for months under the gallery housing the 
Star of India. The plan is brilliant. At last, he bores through the floor and 
is reaching for the gem when a scampering cat breaks the beam and sets off the 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
The guy gets away, but without the Star. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's back to new blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
Critics don't seem to ruffle Davis, who takes the position that what the 
Raiders are attempting to do with their franchise is standard today in sports 
and other industry. 
</P>
<P>
Al has a commodity he believes is worth something to the city obtaining it. No 
one is going to get that commodity for a smile and a fund of persuasive reasons 
why it ought to be his. 
</P>
<P>
That commodity will go for what the market brings, and it becomes the judgment 
of bidders to establish its value. 
</P>
<P>
If all cities decide it is worth nothing, it will go for that sum. 
</P>
<P>
But sports today isn't a game of Eagle Scouts, as evidenced by what promoters 
have done to real estate and other booty from (a) new locations seeking their 
teams, or (b) old locations threatened by their departure. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening now with the Raiders at least offers carbonation to a 
training camp otherwise occupied with such issues as injuries, unsigned players 
and assessment of rookies. 
</P>
<P>
The club seems recovered from the devastating loss it suffered at Oakland, 
blowing the recent deal. 
</P>
<P>
You have heard of the nickel defense? The Raiders ran up against a $600-million 
defense.

JOHNSON A BIT SLOW, BUT RUNS AWAY WITH 200 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Johnson, the fastest man in the world this year at 200 meters, ran to a 
front-running victory Tuesday night at the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson's time, like most of the others during the meet on the Husky 
Stadium track, was slow. He was clocked in 20.54 seconds, far off the world 
best of 19.85 he ran July 6 at Edinburgh, Scotland. Johnson, the U.S. and NCAA 
champion from Baylor, also ran 19.90 in the national championships, making him 
the only runner to break 20 seconds this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't execute off the turn like I usually do, so I had to make up for it by 
getting out of the blocks good and running a strong stretch," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
In his first major international championship meet, Johnson was slowed by a 
strong headwind but finished about two meters ahead of Robson da Silva, the 
South American champion from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Da Silva was timed in 20.77, with Dennis Mitchell of the United States third in 
20.89. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nadezhda Ryashkina, 23, of the Soviet Union regained the world 
record in the women's 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) walk, edging Australian Kerry 
Saxby, the former record holder. 
</P>
<P>
Ryashkina, who set the record last year before losing it to Saxby, shattered 
the mark by 29 seconds, clocking 41:56.21. Saxby also went under her record of 
42:25.2 with a time of 41:57.2. 
</P>
<P>
Dan O'Brien of the United States took a 289-point lead after the first day of 
the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
The rapidly improving O'Brien, coming off his career best of 8,483 points, 
built his advantage in the 100 meters (10.99), long jump (25 feet 11 1/2 
inches), shotput (49-9), high jump (6-9 3/4) and 400 meters (48.38). 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Medved of the Soviet Union, winner of the shotput at 51-1, was second. 
</P>

EAST GERMANS MAY BE HEARING SWAN SONG; 
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING: NOT ONLY IS THEIR SYSTEM CHANGING, BUT U.S. WOMEN APPEAR TO BE 
GAINING GROUND. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a scene all too familiar to the opponents of East German women swimmers 
for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Having won the gold and bronze medals in a race, two East Germans stood on the 
victory stand Tuesday night during the Goodwill Games at the King County 
Aquatics Center and listened to their national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
As practiced early during their training in East Germany's elaborate system of 
sports schools, they stood at attention, forbidden to sing the words in public, 
appearing emotionless. But that is all it was, an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say that when I heard the national anthem, it did make me feel sad," 
said Heike Friedrich, who finished third in the 200-meter freestyle, behind 
gold medalist teammate Manuella Stellmach and silver medalist Nicole Haislett 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that it is one of the last times I will hear it. Even though there were 
things wrong with our system, there were things that worked for us." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it was ultimately important, and many in the country argue today that 
it was not, one thing that worked extremely well was East Germany's sports 
system. In no sport did the so-called "Miracle Machine" achieve more success 
than in women's swimming. 
</P>
<P>
After emerging as a power in the 1974 World Championships, East German women 
won gold medals in 11 of 13 events at the 1976 Olympics. Twelve years later, 
after two Olympics tainted by boycotts, East German women won gold medals in 10 
of 15 events at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
In the Goodwill Games swimming competition, which ended Tuesday night, East 
German women won gold medals in only three of 17 events. Stellmach's victory in 
the 200 freestyle was their only individual gold. They won two relays, but, for 
the first time since 1978, they also lost one, finishing second to the U.S. 
Monday night in the 400-meter medley relay. 
</P>
<P>
"The Goodwill Games is not the most important competition for us," Friedrich 
said. "We are goal-oriented toward the World Championships in January." 
</P>
<P>
But, in the next breath, Friedrich admitted that she fears the East Germans 
will not fare much better at the World Championships in Perth, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
That could be their last major international competition as a separate team, 
although, considering the speed with which East and West Germany are merging 
their political systems, it is possible that the Goodwill Games was the last. 
</P>
<P>
"The political changes have affected us," Friedrich said. "It will definitely 
be worse in the next six months. It will be worse than it has been in the last 
six months." 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich, 20, was a heroine in her country after she returned from Seoul, 
where she won a gold medal in the 200-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Berlin Wall began coming down, the veil of secrecy surrounding the 
sports system followed. Resentful when they learned of the privileges 
successful athletes received, many East Germans blamed the athletes. 
Friedrich's West German car reportedly was vandalized last December. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through a six-week trip to the United States to train and compete here, 
Friedrich's coach, Joachim Rother, learned that he had lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
His sports club in Chemnitz, known as Karl Marx Stadt until earlier this year, 
lost much of its funding and decided to retain only four swimming coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been gone for six weeks and wasn't there to defend his position," 
Friedrich said. "While he was gone, others grabbed up all of the spots." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting to be swallowed by the more financially stable West German system, East 
Germany's sports committee has withdrawn support from most of the sports 
schools and clubs. Only those that have managed to enlist corporate sponsors 
are thriving. East German coaches and athletes are faced with finding jobs 
outside athletics in order to support their training. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go home, we don't know if we will have any training opportunities at 
all," Stellmach said. "Up to now, training has been made available to anyone 
who qualified. Now we have to go out and find sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
Their rivals from the United States have been taking it all in, although not so 
gleefully as might be expected considering the beatings they've taken in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Their coaches and swimmers are really worried about what will happen when they 
get back home," U.S. freestyler Stacy Cassiday said. "They're sort of in a 
panic. They call home almost every day to see what has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Considering their youth, talent and depth, the young Americans -- "The New Kids 
on the Block" -- might have been ready to overtake the East Germans regardless. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. women won 11 gold medals and nine silvers in 17 Goodwill Games events. 
Janet Evans, still only 18, won three gold medals and two silvers. In the 
200-meter butterfly Tuesday night, Summer Sanders, 17, won her third gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
"The East Germans are down a little bit in this meet," U.S. women's Coach 
Richard Quick of Stanford said last weekend. "Anyone can understand why from a 
political point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't know that it's over for the East Germans. They may not be called 
East Germans, but they'll be back. They're just great athletes."

ANGELS' HARVEY FINED, PUT ON 3 YEARS' PROBATION IN APRIL DUI CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Angel relief pitcher Bryan Harvey pleaded guilty July 17 in North Orange County 
Municipal Court to a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
He was fined $1,031.50 at the Fullerton courthouse, placed on three years' 
probation, prohibited from driving a motor vehicle for 90 days except to and 
from work and ordered to enroll in an alcoholism counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, Harvey was stopped at 1:50 a.m. April 16 by a 
California Highway Patrol officer while traveling east on the Riverside 
Freeway, west of the Imperial Highway, in his 1988 Chevrolet Astro. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey was given a field sobriety test and arrested. He was taken to Orange 
County Jail, where a breath analysis test registered .15; the state's legal 
limit is 0.08. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey was booked and placed in a holding cell. In accordance to the jail's 
"cite-and-release" program designed to prevent overcrowding, he was held the 
required four hours and released. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mistake I made during the first home stand," said Harvey, 27, who had 
earned his first save of the season the previous afternoon in the Angels' 4-1 
victory over the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
"It just happened. That's the way it is. I was hoping nobody would find out. I 
took care of it all." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, who says he had no previous DUI offenses, said he has paid the fine and 
will fulfill the driver education part of his sentence in North Carolina, where 
he lives in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
In his second full season with the Angels after spending part of 1987 and '88 
with the club's affiliates in Midland, Tex., and Edmonton, Canada, Harvey has a 
2-2 record this season with a 3.00 earned-run average in 36 innings. He is 
second to Mark Eichhorn in saves with 11 and was unable to pitch Sunday and 
Monday because of a strained muscle in his upper back. 
</P>
<P>
Angel spokesman Tim Mead said the club would have no comment.

DFG GETTING CAUGHT IN A POLITICAL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early this month, hunters appeared to be on the verge of becoming an endangered 
species in California, because of reports that the Department of Fish and Game 
could no longer afford to fight the anti-hunters in court. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 180 DFG employees were about to lose their jobs, including wildlife 
biologists who prepare the environmental documents to justify the hunts. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, DFG Director Pete Bontadelli distributed a bulletin to his 1,500 
employees discussing the "great deal of uncertainty and many rumors" that the 
department was going belly up. 
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to you to keep your spirits up at this difficult time," the bulletin 
said. "The Department of Fish and Game is not being dismantled or gutted. We 
will continue to be a vital critical element in protecting the fish and 
wildlife resources of California." 
</P>
<P>
That was three days after the distribution of a "budget fact sheet" noting that 
reducing the DFG's 1990-91 budget by $12.6 million to $119 million "will 
necessitate eliminating approximately 180 positions." 
</P>
<P>
However, on the next page it was noted that the governor's proposed budget 
contained new sources of revenue "to offset more than 100 of the 180 position 
cuts anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
Also, three days before that, the DFG had released a "1990-91 budget shortfall 
and plan" indicating that Gov. Deukmejian had approved a $9.787-million revenue 
package to lift the DFG out of its hole, subject to approval of the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The signs indicate that it was all an orchestrated scenario crafted by the 
politically savvy Bontadelli, in concert with Deukmejian, who appointed him. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to put pressure on the Legislature," said one insider, who asked not 
to be identified. "My understanding is that nobody is going to be laid off. 
They're playing games over there (in the DFG)." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, it worked. In one instance, Assemblyman Gerry Felando (R-San Pedro) 
is sponsoring a bill -- AB 2126 -- calling for $5.3 million in new commercial 
fisheries taxes, licenses and fees, the major part of the $9.787-million 
package mentioned above. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bontadelli played on the crisis to prod the Legislature into action, 
the prospect of reduced hunting probably wasn't as big a hook as Bontadelli's 
suggestion that the DFG wouldn't be able to manage non-game species, either. 
That hit the anti-hunters right in the heart. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG has budget problems partly because of Sections 711 and 713 of the Fish 
and Game Code, which was written when the department's chief concerns were 
hunting and fishing, with little concern for environmental matters or non-game 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerns have shifted heavily in recent years, but the Code still 
restricts the department to supporting, say, commercial fishing only with 
commercial fishing revenue, and hunting and fishing only with hunting and 
fishing license revenue, with no help from the state's General Fund. In today's 
environmental climate, when hunting and fishing revenue are declining, that 
structure is unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
"I've studied this and have seen that every four years since 1970, the 
department went through this crisis," said Ed Willis, Bontadelli's assistant 
for administration. "Until they get this issue of how the Department of Fish 
and Game is funded, it will always have this problem." 
</P>
<P>
Albacore are not a significant catch of the San Diego sportfishing fleet, but 
few are complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Those operating on overnight and 1 1/2-day schedules are making impressive 
hauls of other exotic species on a daily basis, and there have been no signs of 
slackening. 
</P>
<P>
The Cat Special returned Monday from a 1 1/2-day trip with 23 passengers 
accounting for 105 yellowtail, 68 bluefin tuna, 11 dorado and six albacore. The 
Conquest returned from an overnight trip with 85 yellowtail and 10 dorado. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
Two Humboldt County men will serve four months in jail for poaching a pregnant 
Roosevelt elk along the Klamath River last February. Howard N. O'Neill, 27, of 
Willow Creek also was fined $694 in restitution; Michael J. Uboldi, 25, of 
Hoopa, was ordered to pay $761. A third man, Timothy W. Ames, 24, of Hoopa, is 
scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 6.

FISHING: THE PROSPECT OF A SHARK-FISHING TOURNAMENT IN SALMON COUNTRY HAS SOME 
OREGONIANS SEEING RED.

Sharks could soon be invading the coastal waters of northern Oregon. The 
well-being of tourists would be at stake. Surfers would surf at greater risk. 
Sailboarders would sail ill at ease. Children playing at the water's edge might 
face imminent danger. 
</P>
<P>
"We are surfers, sailboarders, swimmers, jet skiers. It's our playground," 
Steve McKenzie said of the waters in and about the Columbia River. The former 
logging and commercial fishing region has been transformed largely into an area 
that relies heavily on tourism and recreation -- and, more recently, into one 
embroiled in controversy over a coming event. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie, owner of a surf shop in Seaside, a coastal community about 15 miles 
south of the Columbia River, is one of a growing number of citizens deeply 
concerned about the forthcoming "first annual Columbia River-Pacific Ocean 
SHARK Tournament." 
</P>
<P>
There has never been a shark-fishing tournament off the Oregon coast, and the 
announcement of the Aug. 3-4 contest has met unexpected resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are writing to state agencies in protest. A collective assault on the 
"shark hunt" has begun. An injunction is being sought to stop it. Store owners 
are refusing to display posters advertising the event, citing fear of boycotts 
on the part of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really weird. I had no idea that this kind of reaction would take place," 
said biologist Larry Hreha, a shark expert with the Oregon Department of Fish 
and Wildlife. "It's kind of like the movie, 'Jaws.' You get that type of 
mentality going and it just feeds on itself." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Miller, an attorney and charter boat owner responsible for organizing the 
tournament, said he did so to help out some of the charter operators facing 
hard times and "to pump some money into the economy at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Federally imposed restrictions on salmon fishing have curtailed several 
operations. Salmon fishing is no longer allowed in the ocean on Fridays and 
Saturdays -- to allow the fish to move freely up the river and its tributaries 
-- and seasons have been restricted significantly in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Dollman of Reel 'Em In Charters in Ilwaco, Wash., a tournament sponsor 
located on the coast just across the Columbia River, said that when he arrived 
in 1978, the season ran from May 1 to the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we fished a total of 10 days before the operation was shut down," 
he said. "What we're trying to do is pick up some extra income to make up for 
these lousy short seasons we're getting." 
</P>
<P>
Enter the shark tournament, which prompted Josh Gizdavich, owner of a sailboard 
store in Warrenton, Ore., to warn the Oregonian newspaper that the contest 
"could create fear and hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
The contest already appears to have done that. 
</P>
<P>
Susanna Hendrix of Seaside told the Oregonian that an employee of a 
charter-fishing operation told her the waters are already being "chummed" with 
blood and guts to attract sharks to the area. "Who will tell the sharks that 
have been lured in from many, many miles away that it's time to go home now?" 
she asked in a letter sent to various state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Chumming is illegal within three miles of the Oregon coast. The Department of 
Fish and Wildlife announced that it would probably make an exception for the 
tournament, but backed off because of pressure from the public. Non-anglers 
insist it still is going on. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are extremely worried that what we're going to do is pour blood all 
over the ocean and put different scraps and everything else in to attract 
sharks," Dollman said. "This (theoretically) would create some type of chaos 
amongst swimmers -- they figure we're going to bring the sharks in there and 
they'll eat them up." 
</P>
<P>
Doc Doolittle, a Seaside and Hood River representative for sailboard makers and 
organizer of a competition scheduled Aug. 26, said that a strong current runs 
south from the Columbia River to Seaside and back north in a circular motion 
that would carry any chum dumped into the sea along the entire stretch of 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
The result, he said, would be "to have solid whites (great white sharks) from 
the mouth of the river to Seaside." 
</P>
<P>
Shark experts emphatically reject such a claim, saying chances are extremely 
slim of white sharks gathering near the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't occur in large numbers," said Bob Lea, a biologist for the 
California Department of Fish and Game who has done extensive research on 
sharks. "There seems to be a misconception (about the behavior of sharks) up 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Lea did say that all shark attacks off the Oregon coast have involved great 
whites. But only six have ever been documented. None were fatal. 
</P>
<P>
And although the current Doolitle mentions does exist, according to shark 
expert Hreha, that does not mean that chumming would increase the number of 
sharks in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a problem with chumming, it would certainly have shown up in past 
years," Hreha said. "Any day during the salmon season, you've got hundreds, 
maybe thousands of boats out there, catching thousands of salmon. Most of those 
salmon . . . they're split open, their guts are thrown over board, the gills 
and the heads. 
</P>
<P>
"And (the salmon fishing boats) are operating much closer to shore than I think 
the shark tournament will operate. So, if there was going to be a problem, it 
certainly would have shown up by now." 
</P>
<P>
Chumming for sharks has yet to create such a stir in Southern California, where 
shark fishing and shark tournaments are becoming increasingly popular. 
</P>
<P>
There have been few complaints about the possibility of an increased likelihood 
of attacks. None of the incidents involving shark-human interactions have been 
blamed on fishermen chumming for sharks. 
</P>
<P>
But Oregonians insist chumming for sharks sets a dangerous precedent. "Who's 
going to be liable should there be an attack?" McKenzie asked. "Who's going to 
put up signs to warn the swimmers to stay out of the water?" 
</P>
<P>
These fears have been raised repeatedly despite Miller's insistence that shark 
fishing will take place as far as 30 miles from the coast, where most species 
of sharks occur. 
</P>
<P>
But the public isn't buying that, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Three miles to a white shark is like a walk to the grocery store to you and 
me," McKenzie said. "Sixty miles is nothing to a white shark." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Miller said the first annual Columbia River-Pacific Ocean SHARK 
Tournament will go on as scheduled, with a few dozen boats already signed up -- 
at a cost of $600 each -- and several more expected to be entered before the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
But he isn't sure there will be a second tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this would benefit the whole community -- the five Columbia River 
ports," he said. "I thought it was a good idea at the time." 
</P>

<P>
TRAVEL: THE L.A.-BAY AREA TICKET PRICE WAR HELPS VACATIONERS, WHO CAN BOOK FAR 
IN ADVANCE, BUT CORPORATE FLIERS CHAFE AT THE RESTRICTIONS.

<P>
The way frequent flier Stan Spiegel of San Francisco sees it, the current round 
of ticket discounting in the busy California air corridor puts fares down where 
they should be -- finally. 
</P>
<P>
"The high fares are a rip-off," said Spiegel, an importer and manufacturer of 
kitchen linens and bed sheets who got exasperated when the short hop to visit 
his Los Angeles customers soared to $300 round trip. "You can go to New York 
cheaper than Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that the respite will probably be short-lived, Spiegel plans to take 
advantage of a fare war that started early this month when airlines matched 
no-frills newcomer Southwest Airlines' $58 round-trip fare on the 
Burbank-Oakland route. That is, he'll take advantage of it to the extent that 
he can as a business traveler, given the heavy restrictions on the cheap seats 
and his need to travel often on a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Spiegel angrily maintains, he'll be stuck paying full 
freight as usual and subsidizing vacation travelers. 
</P>
<P>
One might assume that an all-out fare war in the heavily traveled Bay 
Area-Southern California corridor would be a cause for celebration, and leisure 
passengers, who can plan getaways well in advance, are indeed applauding it. 
</P>
<P>
But others -- notably business travelers and travel agents -- contend that the 
fare war is confusing and promotes distrust in airlines by making travelers 
skeptical that fares are ever really fair. 
</P>
<P>
For now at least, passengers who book and pay for flights three weeks in 
advance, avoid traveling on a Friday or a Sunday and don't mind forgoing a 
refund if their plans change can fly for $29 each way from any Bay Area airport 
to any Southern California destination. A wide variety of less restrictive, 
higher -- but still relatively low -- fares can be had closer to departure 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
"One day it costs a fortune, and the next day they're giving it away," said 
Holly Huebel, co-owner of Holly Travel Associates in San Francisco. "I could 
well understand if the general public doesn't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Passengers say the discounting recalls the kind of free-wheeling competition 
that prevailed back when Pacific Southwest Airlines of San Diego, Newport 
Beach-based AirCal and other regional carriers flew the route -- before they 
got swallowed up by bigger players. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, passengers could rely on frequent price skirmishes; round-trip 
fares of $99 were common, with one-way tickets occasionally dropping as low as 
$19. But the bloody fare wars also took a toll on the carriers. 
</P>
<P>
PSA, for one, suffered losses every year from 1979 on, making it vulnerable to 
a purchase by USAir in 1987. About the same time, American Airlines bought 
AirCal, and Delta took over Los Angeles-based Western Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
After the mergers, prices rose. Airlines justified the higher fares by citing 
rising fuel costs and the cost of buying and maintaining jets. 
</P>
<P>
But many passengers contended that, with the exception of scattered promotional 
fares, prices stayed stubbornly and artificially high. In recent months, 
discount round-trip fares of $145 were available in the market, but the full, 
unrestricted fare was a whopping $372. 
</P>
<P>
Once Southwest entered the corridor in April, however, other airlines went on 
the offensive to try to keep regular business passengers from deserting to the 
upstart. (Southwest also consistently came in low with an unrestricted $59 
one-way fare on its Burbank-Oakland route.) 
</P>
<P>
On the San Francisco-Los Angeles route, the corridor's most popular, United 
went to half-hourly service from hourly service. All told, United has 120 
flights each business day between the Bay Area and Southern California, up from 
38 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
USAir added a dozen round trips each day in the corridor. On June 1, Delta 
swept in with hourly flights. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines also began tempting passengers with free newspapers, more convenient 
gates and mileage bonuses for members of frequent-flier programs. Delta even 
installed facsimile lines and computer hookups for business travelers in its 
airport terminals. 
</P>
<P>
But ticket prices held firm until July 3, when United, Delta, USAir, American 
and Alaska matched Southwest, the Dallas-based carrier that serves no meals and 
provides seats, even for passengers with reservations, on a first-come, 
first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
"It was inevitable it would turn into a fare war because of all the metal they 
have flying between the two cities," said Bob Wisse, president of Getz 
International Travel, a San Francisco agency. 
</P>
<P>
By his firm's estimate, there are now more than 500 flights each business day 
in the corridor. With an average of 120 seats per flight, that means airlines 
must try to fill 60,000 spots each day. Estimates of total number of riders in 
the corridor vary widely -- from 2.2 million to 8 million a year. Meanwhile, 
industry analysts estimate that carriers in the corridor are flying only 30% to 
35% full these days between San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The over-capacity "doesn't make a whole lot of economic sense," acknowledged 
Greg Witter, a spokesman for Alaska Airlines. "Somebody will have to fall out 
of that market." 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Starkman, an airline industry analyst with the Paine Webber 
investment firm in New York, said: "There are just too many seats. I can't 
imagine that anybody will break even at those fares." 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder, then, that airlines are trying to tempt leisure travelers to 
fill seats that otherwise would remain empty during the summer months, when 
business travel tapers off -- even if it means selling tickets at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. McAdoo, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York, said 
American Airlines has indicated that the fare war in the California corridor 
will cost it about $2.5 million a month -- a small amount compared to its $11 
billion in annual revenue but enough to cause concern among investors. 
</P>
<P>
As welcome as the fare war is to many leisure travelers, the helter-skelter 
fare game is a source of frustration and confusion for business travelers and 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
"The 21-day advance purchase is ridiculous," said George Koster, a free-lance 
events producer who commutes between San Francisco and Los Angeles. "It doesn't 
do the business traveler any good." 
</P>
<P>
Natalie Lewis, a consultant with Unravel Travel in San Francisco, agreed that 
the lower fares just don't help business people who learn about out-of-town 
meetings at the last minute. And airlines aren't disposed to make it easy for 
full-fare business travelers, their bread and butter, to take advantage of 
discounts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's useless and very upsetting for business people who have to leave 
tomorrow," Lewis said. "I hear people screaming." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some companies put pressure on employees to get the best fares, 
even if it means driving an hour or two to appointments from an out-of-the-way 
airport. One executive at a large corporation threatened to fire the company's 
travel agent if he caught him sending an employee on a more expensive ticket 
for the sake of convenience. 
</P>
<P>
One man keeping a close eye on fares is state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). 
Last spring, Torres, who is particularly miffed about hefty fares from his home 
town to Sacramento, floated a bill that would have created a state-owned 
airline called Golden State Air. Largely taken as a joke by the airline 
industry, which nicknamed the proposed airline Califlot, the measure 
nonetheless garnered a bit of support before being shot down by legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, according to press secretary Peter Blackshaw, views the fare cuts as a 
heartening but undoubtedly temporary phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always temporary, and before you know it, you're paying $300 again," 
Blackshaw said. Torres, he added, intends to introduce the bill again next 
year.

JAMES FLANIGAN: DEFICIT-FIGHTERS EYE MORTGAGE INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a serious possibility that the Bush Administration and Congress will 
raise tax revenue by cutting your deduction for mortgage interest. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, the big tax deduction of the American middle class may come under 
the knife, say Washington sources, because budget negotiators need a way to 
close the government's yawning deficit. 
</P>
<P>
And limiting mortgage interest deductions, which now total about $35 billion a 
year, could certainly help do that. One idea being discussed could raise more 
than $50 billion in tax revenue in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Paying that $50 billion extra to the government would be people in the 28% tax 
bracket, meaning anybody with income above $30,950 for couples filing joint 
returns and $18,550 for single taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt it would raise a lot of revenue," says David Shulman, head of 
real estate research for Salomon Bros., "but also no doubt that it would be a 
negative for housing and home prices." That would be true especially where home 
prices are high -- California and the Northeast and areas around major cities 
where homes run to several hundred thousand dollars and mortgage interest can 
total tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, nobody contemplates eliminating the deduction entirely. Rather, the 
talk in Washington is of limits -- one congressional staffer suggests that a 
cap of $20,000 be put on all interest deductions. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, there is growing support for limiting the mortgage deduction to 
the lower 15% tax bracket, meaning that any amounts deducted from gross income 
would reduce one's taxes by 15%, not 28%. 
</P>
<P>
To understand, you have to think in tax dollars, say congressional experts. For 
example, let us say a $60,000 gross income is reduced $12,000 by deducting 
mortgage interest of $10,000 and real estate taxes of $2,000. At 28%, that 
deduction reduces the taxes that would otherwise be paid by $3,360. So it is 
said to "save" the taxpayer $3,360 in tax dollars and, correspondingly, to 
"cost" the government that amount. But if that $12,000 deduction is allowed 
only at the 15% bracket, it reduces taxes due by only $1,800. That means the 
taxpayer would pony up $1,560 more in taxes -- the difference between $3,360 
and $1,800. 
</P>
<P>
The result would be a lot of people paying more in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the idea of treating mortgage deductions at the 15% rate appeals to both 
Republicans and Democrats, according to Washington sources. Republicans like it 
because it would allow them to raise tax revenue without, at least formally, 
raising tax rates. Democrats like it because it would equalize the tax benefit, 
in percentage terms, of deductions for the millionaire's mansion and Joe 
Sixpack's bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
That's political bunk, of course. The big tax revenues would be raised, as they 
always are, from the broad middle class -- not only from millionaires. And 
whether taxes are raised by higher rates or lower deductions, the effect is 
that people will pay more in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, of course, limiting interest deductibility could have broad 
effects in the U.S. economy. It would tend to reduce credit, and thus further 
weaken housing markets and home prices. It would put a crimp in home equity 
loans, which banks now market as a middle-class tax shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there are those who say it's an idea whose time has come. The thought of 
achieving tax fairness by treating all deductions -- including state and local 
taxes and charitable contributions -- at a single rate was included in initial 
proposals for the 1986 Tax Reform Act by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) and Rep. 
Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.). It aroused opposition on practical lines -- from 
state governors and the housing industry -- but not on party or ideological 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives don't oppose the idea because they believe that interest 
deductions have distorted the U.S. economy, encouraging too much financing for 
second homes and not enough for industry. "We have been diverting capital to 
housing that might be put to better uses," says Dale Jorgenson, professor of 
economics at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, policy is shifting. Housing has received strong support in this 
country since Congress made mortgage interest deductible in 1913, and 
introduced federal mortgage insurance in 1934. As a result, the United States, 
with allowances for those who are ill-housed or for various reasons homeless, 
is the best-housed nation in the world. 
</P>
<P>
But other countries, Canada, Japan and Britain to name three, have high rates 
of home ownership and yet do not grant full mortgage interest deductibility. 
And now the question of how much tax support U.S. housing needs has begun to be 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean that change will come easily. The debate over interest 
deductibility will be a political blowout, with middle-class homeowners 
everywhere protesting vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the government deficit is huge, and sizable alternatives for financing 
it are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Tax Reform Act, which cut tax benefits on commercial property, left 
residential real estate relatively untouched. Nonetheless, it established the 
principle of limiting deductions for mortgage interest -- if only by setting 
the limit at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Budget negotiators in 1990 are likely to go much further.

EASTERN EXPECTS TO BE INDICTED ON CHARGES OF FALSIFYING SAFETY DATA; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: SOME OF ITS EXECUTIVES MAY BE ACCUSED OF IRREGULARITIES IN 
MAINTENANCE RECORDS. ITS BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE SAYS VIOLATIONS TOOK PLACE BEFORE 
LAST YEAR'S STRIKE.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eastern Airlines, already in deep financial trouble, said Tuesday that the 
company and some of its executives will be indicted on charges of falsifying 
maintenance and safety records. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first time that an airline has been criminally charged with 
violating safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, which is expected to be disclosed officially today, was 
announced to reporters by Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the airline's court-appointed 
trustee in bankruptcy. He said he did not know which of Eastern's managers 
would be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, NBC News said it had learned that a federal grand jury had 
returned a 60-count indictment against Eastern and nine employees. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's report Tuesday said the indictment would name Edward Upton, the airline's 
former senior vice president of maintenance; Joseph Moser, a former maintenance 
manager; Thomas Lewis, a regional director, and six supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Such an indictment would be another major blow for Miami-based Eastern, which 
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code in March, 1989. The filing was prompted by a strike five days earlier by 
the airline's machinists, pilots and flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, partly as a result of continuing bad publicity, Eastern has been 
forced to sell many of its assets, including lucrative Caribbean and Latin 
American routes, which were bought recently by American Airlines. Eastern says 
it is losing about $2 million a day, in large part because it is attracting so 
few business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue was appointed as trustee three months ago to run Eastern when the 
bankruptcy court in New York took control of the airline out of the hands of 
its owner, financier Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp. The parent company, which 
also owns Continental Airlines, has since changed its name to Continental 
Airlines Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue told reporters Tuesday that safety violations occurred at several 
Eastern maintenance facilities before last year's strike and bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue said a federal grand jury had conducted a 10-month investigation of the 
airline. The indictment comes after the airline was unable to reach a plea 
bargain agreement with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
The government sought to have Eastern plead guilty to a conspiracy charge, 
Shugrue said, but the airline refused because it might appear to the public 
that the safety violations were "systemic." The executive insisted that there 
are no systemwide safety problems at Eastern, arguing that the airline now 
ranks as the world's safest because it has been so closely scrutinized by 
government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue said prosecutors' demand for a guilty plea to a conspiracy charge 
"would have called into question this entire airline's present, superior 
maintenance program and all employees and managers involved in it. We cannot 
plead guilty to violations of the law for which we find no evidence. The U.S. 
attorney's office has offered us no evidence of systemic wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment reportedly will include allegations of wire fraud, obstruction 
of justice and making false statements. 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue said that in recent days Eastern's attorneys and the U.S. attorney for 
the eastern district of New York, Andrew J. Maloney, have conducted discussions 
"to attempt to put this investigation and these matters to rest." Such efforts 
failed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where wrongdoing occurred, particularly at our JFK (New York's John F. Kennedy 
International Airport) maintenance facility, employees were terminated and or 
resigned," Shugrue said. "And the Federal Aviation Administration levied 
substantial civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, the company was prepared to acknowledge to the U.S. attorney in 
the form of a guilty plea that certain irregularities occurred during the 
pre-strike period, up until March of 1989, with respect to our record-keeping 
at Kennedy and perhaps other stations." 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Eastern paid $2.9 million to settle FAA allegations of safety 
violations. As in most such settlements with the FAA, the airline did not admit 
to violating safety requirements. Eastern has since closed its maintenance 
facilities at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
News reports earlier this month said the grand jury investigating Eastern was 
expected to indict more than seven current and former employees, including vice 
presidents of the company. In addition to Kennedy International, violations 
were said to have taken place at New York's LaGuardia Airport and Hartsfield 
Airport in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
According to those reports, employees were expected to be accused of falsifying 
maintenance records. They were said to have approved repairs that were 
improperly performed and, in some cases, not performed at all. 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue repeatedly emphasized that the violations occurred several years ago.

Since the past violations, he said, "the airline has undergone a rigorous

ADMINISTRATION FAVORS PHONE FIRMS' ENTRY INTO CABLE, NO RE-REGULATION 
</P>

The Bush Administration said Tuesday that it favors allowing telephone 
companies into the cable-television business but opposes even modest 
re-regulation of the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Thomas J. Sugrue, deputy assistant secretary of commerce, said 
President Bush may veto legislation to regulate the industry, even if it 
includes a provision that would permit phone companies to enter the cable 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Sugrue's testimony before a congressional subcommittee broke two years of 
virtual silence by the Administration on the subject. Critics charge that 
permitting the phone companies into the business could lead to a massive 
monopoly over the communications field. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration believes pro-consumer objectives can best be accomplished 
in the long run, not by re-regulating the cable industry, but by expanding 
competition," Sugrue said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is so opposed to regulation that it also cautioned against 
Congress "attempting to specify detailed safeguards" against the phone 
companies if they are allowed entry into cable. 
</P>
<P>
Such safeguards would be designed to prevent phone companies from using 
telephone rates to subsidize their cable-television business or from engaging 
in discriminatory practices against cable competitors that use their telephone 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Sugrue's staunch free market approach came in a Senate Commerce, Science and 
Transportation subcommittee hearing on the provision relating to the phone 
companies. It marked the first time that a Bush Administration official had 
agreed to discuss its ideas about cable before a Senate panel, even though a 
bill that would re-regulate the industry already is on the Senate floor and 
near passage. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Sugrue's testimony, many in Congress said they still doubt that the 
Administration in an election year would veto legislation designed to help 
consumers angry with price gouging and poor service in the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
The only check on free market competition that Sugrue said the Administration 
would want to toughen is a provision to forbid phone companies from entering 
the cable-television business by acquiring existing cable-TV companies. The 
current bill, sponsored by Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.), would allow phone 
companies to acquire minority interests in existing cable companies and in some 
cases controlling interests. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's rigid free-market approach offered so late in the process 
clearly annoyed members of the Senate and provoked several sarcastic exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), chairman of the subcommittee, wanted to know 
why the Administration offered its views only after 10 hearings involving 80 
witnesses, and just as the re-regulation legislation is ready for Senate 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The only other contact from the Administration was a three-paragraph letter 
sent the day the Commerce Committee took final action on re-regulation. The 
letter said without explanation that the Administration opposes the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.) asked if the Administration's stance against 
regulation means that it does not see the cable industry as a monopoly. Most 
cable operators have exclusive franchises in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it is not fully competitive and not fully a monopoly," Sugrue 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
Danforth continued to probe, asking what constitutes competition for cable 
companies and whether the Administration considers over-the-air broadcasters to 
constitute effective competition. Sugrue said the Administration is split over 
what constitutes effective competition. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said Tuesday night that the Administration will announce 
whether it intends to veto the measure when the legislation is passed by 
Congress. Most experts believe that it would prefer to see the Senate and House 
bills die rather than having to face the politically difficult option of 
vetoing a bill favored by many consumers.

Several companies joined a growing list of oil firms that have reported strong 
profits despite low crude prices in the spring, although the low crude prices 
worked to depress earnings at others. 
</P>
<P>
* Chevron Corp. reported that second-quarter earnings jumped 60% to $648 
million, compared to $404 million in last year's second quarter. Revenue rose 
to $8.9 billion from $8.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Refining and marketing, known in the industry as "downstream" operations, were 
the source of the San Francisco company's biggest gain. U.S. downstream 
operations reported record earnings of $370 million in the quarter, compared to 
$103 million in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
"We are particularly pleased with the strong operating performance of our U.S. 
downstream business during the second quarter," said Chairman and Chief 
Executive Ken Derr. "As the nation's largest refiner and marketer, we benefited 
significantly from strong product sales margins, which in part reflect progress 
in our programs to upgrade our refinery and service station network." 
</P>
<P>
For the first half, Chevron earnings rose to $1.12 billion from $717 million in 
last year's first half. Revenue rose to $18.3 billion from $15.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* Mobil posted a 24.2% increase in earnings to $498 million, compared to $401 
million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue fell to $13.82 billion from $14.03 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 quarter included a net gain of $182 million from the sale of two major 
assets, while the company posted a $140-million loss on the sale of southern 
Africa operations in last year's second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half, Mobil had earnings of $898 million, compared to $830 
million in the like period last year. Revenue rose slightly to $28.85 billion 
from $28.05 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, said net income during the 
quarter totaled $353 million, down from $366 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 3% to $8.72 billion from $8.45 billion a year ago, largely because 
of higher crude and oil product sales volumes. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to lower crude prices during the second quarter, natural gas prices 
also fell and petrochemical results were "significantly lower . . . because of 
oversupply and reduced demand," Texaco President and Chief Executive James W. 
Kinnear said in a statement from the company's White Plains, N.Y., 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
For the year's first half, Texaco reported net income of $681 million down 63% 
from $1.82 billion in the year-ago period, which included a $1.19-billion gain 
from the sale of Texaco Canada Inc. Without the gain, this year's net income 
was up 8%, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
First-half revenue was off 1% at $17.88 billion from $18.06 billion. 
</P>
<P>
* Phillips, of Bartlesville, Okla., reported second-quarter net income of $105 
million, down from $197 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The recent quarter included $58 million in insurance reimbursement that 
compensated for lost earnings at Phillips' Houston chemical complex, which was 
shut down after an accident in October, 1989 and remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue declined 9% to $2.98 billion from $3.3 billion a year ago.

Domestic Car, Truck Sales Off: Car and light-truck sales by the nation's major 
auto makers dropped 13% in mid-July, compared to last year when buyers flocked 
to showrooms to take advantage of incentives, the companies said. The sales 
rate during the July 11-20 period last year was among the highest of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives that drew customers into showrooms during the year-ago period were 
trimmed back this year. The 10 major U.S. vehicle manufacturers said they sold 
cars and trucks at a combined average daily rate of 34,549 during the period 
this year, compared to a daily average of 39,726 during the same time last 
year. Car sales fell 13.3%, and truck sales dropped 12.6%. GM, Ford and 
Chrysler said their car sales during the period fell 17.8%, while sales of cars 
made by Japanese companies in the United States rose 23%.

EDS Pushing Microcomputers: Electronic Data Systems, which earns an annual $5.5 
billion maintaining massive mainframe and minicomputer systems, has shown it 
also knows how to think small. As powerful microcomputer networks take business 
away from larger systems, Dallas-based EDS is maneuvering to strengthen its 
microcomputer division by emphasizing service, training and support of its 
microcomputer software and systems. Although the division represents only 5% of 
its total sales, EDS is already among the country's top 15 PC resellers. Dallas

Home Baby Care Seen as Growth Market: Healthdyne is one company prepared to 
ride the wave of home obstetrics-care growth. Revenue for the Georgia company's 
perinatal services division grew to $15 million in 1989 from $1.1 million in 
1987. Although the division did not yield a profit in 1989, the company is 
optimistic that it can turn that around with products such as its home uterine 
activity monitor. The monitor has not received full FDA approval, but the 
companys says new information on its effectiveness, due out in the next nine 
months, will help its cause. Atlanta Journal and Constitution

Cellular Phones Take Canada by Storm: If cellular telephones seem a 
particularly American indulgence, think again. Growth in Canada the past five 
years has astounded skeptics, with users increasing to 462,000 on June 1 of 
this year from 12,000 at the end of 1985. Robert Latham, president of Bell 
Cellular, says he underestimated capital construction budgets in 1989 by nearly 
$200 million. And George Fierheller, chairman of Rogers Cantel, reports that 
his expectation of 60,000 subscribers by 1989 missed the mark by 165,000. 
Fierheller calls cellular the "business opportunity of the century." Toronto

Food Price Hike Hits 9-Year High: Americans still pay less for food as a 
percentage of their income than any other nation, but droughts and fluctuations 
in global markets combined to push prices up 5.5% last year -- the most in nine 
years. The situation is likely to worsen as the federal government considers 
dropping farm incentives and subsidies -- which have historically kept food 
prices down. Milwaukee Journal

DOW UP 17.82 AS BUYERS HUNT FOR BARGAINS

<P>
Stocks closed higher Tuesday, as buyers moved in late in the day to grab blue 
chip bargains left over after Monday's big tumble. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index rose 17.82 points to 2,922.52, recouping a 
fraction of the 56.44-point fall Monday, when a broad decline saw the Dow down 
as much as 107 points early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
But most of Tuesday's Dow gain reflected movements in the oil stocks Chevron, 
Exxon and Texaco. In the over-the-counter market, meanwhile, the NASDAQ 
composite index lost 2.08 to 442.56, showing continued selling pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow had seesawed between minor gains and losses all morning until 
futures-related sell programs pushed it to a double-digit decline in early 
afternoon. Renewed buying -- particularly in the Oil Patch -- sparked a 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The broader market showed less movement. In nationwide trading of New York 
Stock Exchange-listed stocks, 753 rose, 755 fell and 509 were unchanged. Big 
Board volume shrank to 181.9 million shares from 209 million Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Trading remained volatile as the stock market punished leading corporations 
that reported earnings pressures. 
</P>
<P>
* Two blue chip companies, Dow Chemical and Morgan Stanley, saw their stocks 
plummet after they reported second-quarter profit declines. Dow fell 5 3/4 to 
52 3/8, while Morgan Stanley dropped 6 to 66 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Reuters Holdings, the international news organization, fell 10 to 56 1/4 
after saying it expects its earnings growth to slow in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"One leading stock after another has been taken out and shot," said Ralph 
Bloch, analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
"The oils are bolstering stocks today, but we're not seeing the broad market 
participate at this point," added A. C. Moore, director of research at Argus 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
Other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* The oil rally was very strong on news that Iraq had moved troops to Kuwait's 
border in a dispute over Iraq's demand for higher OPEC oil prices. Exxon rose 2 
1/8 to 50, Texaco added 2 3/4 to 62 1/2, Chevron rose 1 7/8 to 77 3/4, Unocal 
gained 7/8 to 31 and Halliburton jumped 2 3/8 to 53 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Capital Cities/ABC tumbled 55 1/2 to 533 after the company reported 
second-quarter earnings below analysts' estimates and projected a weak third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
* Many growth stocks bounced back from Monday's selloff. Boeing added 1 to 56 
7/8, 3M rose 1 1/4 to 90 1/4, Amgen rose 2 to 87 1/2 and Tokos Medical gained 
5/8 to 13 3/4. But tech stocks were mostly weak. Teradata lost 1 1/2 to 23 3/4, 
Intel fell 1 1/8 to 43 3/8 and Maxtor tumbled 3 5/8 to 10 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, shares closed down but well off their lows. The 225-share Nikkei 
average lost 192.33 points to 31,702.46. In London, prices were generally flat. 
The Financial Times 100-share index rose 1.2 points to close at 2,360.9. In 
Frankfurt, shares weakened in thin trading. The DAX index fell 16.88 to 
1,921.16. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Bond Prices Retreat on Credit Concerns 
</P>
<P>
The bond market continued to retreat despite Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's pledge to continue fighting inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond lost 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 in face 
amount, sending its yield up to 8.57% from 8.55% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told a House Banking subcommittee that the nation's central bank was 
intent on reducing inflation. But he also predicted that a "credible and 
enforceable" agreement between Congress and the White House to lower the 
federal budget deficit would lead to a "very significant response" by the Fed 
to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Some bond traders are worried that Fed policy might become too loose, allowing 
inflation to resurge. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8%, up slightly from Monday's 7.938%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Interest Rate Fears Push Dollar Lower 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was mixed against key foreign currencies on the belief that U.S. 
interest rates will decline. 
</P>
<P>
Technical factors, along with news of an Iraqi troop buildup along the Kuwaiti 
border, helped temper its fall, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar rose to a closing 148.70 
Japanese yen from 148.50 yen Monday. But it fell to 148.35 yen in London and 
148.40 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled at $367.90 an ounce, off 
$1.20 from Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Oil Futures Gain as OPEC Convenes 
</P>
<P>
September contracts for West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished at $20.56 a 
barrel Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 6 cents from Monday, as 
OPEC ministers began gathering for a critical strategy session. 
</P>
<P>
A number of ministers expressed support for increasing the cartel's benchmark 
price for its crude from the current $18 a barrel, which would require 
agreement on new production limits. 
</P>
<P>
Iran has proposed a reference price of $20 a barrel while Iraq wants a $25 
level. Iraq is threatening Kuwait militarily over alleged production cheating.

PBS WILL BACK PRODUCERS ON OBSCENITY OATH; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: NETWORK EXECUTIVES SAY THEY WOULD NOT EXPECT PROGRAM SUPPLIERS TO 
SIGN NEA PLEDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Top executives at the Public Broadcasting Service on Tuesday entered the fray 
over the "indecency oath" that Congress has imposed on recipients of funding 
from the National Endowment for the Arts, saying that PBS would "fully support" 
any producer who refused to sign such an oath. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be very surprised if our producers would sign that," Neil Mahrer, PBS 
executive vice president and chief operating officer, told a news conference at 
the Century Plaza hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Producers who lost or risked NEA funding by refusing to sign would receive the 
full support of PBS, said programming chief Jennifer Lawson. The noncommercial 
network might attempt to provide funding to producers who sacrifice grants by 
taking a stand, but it was more likely to help them look for alternative 
sources of revenue, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to make promises, in that we are always scrambling for 
funding," Lawson told the gathering of TV critics and writers here for meetings 
with network and cable officials about the fall season. "But I think we would 
do all that we could to provide the moral support if not the financial 
support." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lawson and Mahrer stopped short of actually urging producers to refuse 
to sign an oath, or of saying that PBS would refuse programming made after an 
anti-obscenity pledge was signed. 
</P>
<P>
"This may sound like a cop-out, but the truth is that the Public Broadcasting 
Service does not produce any of its own programming," Mahrer said. "Our 
producers are the ones who would make a decision whether or not to sign." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, six public-television series -- "Live From Lincoln Center," 
"American Masters," "Great Performances," "Point of View," "Alive from Off 
Center" and "American Playhouse" -- receive a total of approximately $7 million 
in NEA funding each year. 
</P>
<P>
None of those producers has yet been affected by the "decency standards" 
advocated by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and other conservatives, but many fear 
that their work will be constrained in the future, Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the kind of chill factor, a chilling effect on 
creativity" that might occur should the guidelines and oath be continued beyond 
the current fiscal year, as Congress is considering, Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
She cited as an example a documentary recently broadcast on "Point of View," 
called "Metamorphosis: Man Into Woman," about a person going through a sex 
change. That program might not receive funding were the NEA to restrict its 
support, and producers, fearing a withdrawal of money, might not even attempt 
to produce such programs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the assembled reporters also were told Tuesday that the Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting will fund or partially fund six new series, including 
an educational game show for children based on the popular computer game, 
"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?" 
</P>
<P>
Dan Marbury, director of the corporation's Television Program Fund, said that 
the organization would spend $4.1 million on the programs, which are planned 
for prime-time broadcast in 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The first new series to air will likely be "Carmen Sandiego," which is designed 
to teach children about geography in a game-show format and is scheduled to run 
for 26 weeks in 1991. (The "Carmen Sandiego" computer game also has been 
licensed by DIC Enterprises for development as a children's cartoon series.) 
</P>
<P>
"The History of Baseball," to be produced by public station WETA in Washington, 
D.C., will focus on aspects of the game that are typically ignored, said 
Lawson, such as discrimination against women and blacks, and the gradual 
incorporation of the nation's melting pot population into the game as fans and 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"Cracking the Code" is a biology series consisting of eight 60-minute programs, 
with "Nova" executive producer Paula Apsell in charge of production. 
</P>
<P>
"The Other Side of the News," scheduled for 1991, will be produced by pioneer 
television news producer Fred W. Friendly and Columbia University Seminars on 
Mass Media and Society. The nine-part series is designed to tell the story 
behind gathering the news and to offer criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"The '90s," a series designed to help vieweres question traditional news 
perspectives and find alternative ways to get information about the world, is 
the only one of the new series that might run later than prime time, said 
Lawson. The show might be better suited to late night, she said, because it 
will deal with fairly controversial topics. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, "Critical Condition" is an eight-part series on the future of medical 
science, to be produced by WETA and WNET in New York.

PRELIMINARY OPEN FESTIVAL LIST SHOWS A HAPPY HODGEPODGE; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. TREASURE: THE UNCURATED CELEBRATION OF LOCAL ARTS WILL INCLUDE 600 EVENTS; 
NOT ALL ARE GEMS. 
</P>

Peter Sellars has set the challenge. "We're calling it an 'invitation to 
exploration,' " he says, "and it will take an intrepid explorer or somebody 
with a real interest in uncharted (arts) territory to get through it." 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, Sellars isn't talking about programming for his own 
Pacific-themed L.A. Festival, in which many of the performers, films and visual 
art shows will be unknown to L.A. audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he is talking about the 600-or-so mostly locally based events 
confirmed for presentation in conjunction with September's L.A. Festival 
through the connected Open Festival. 
</P>
<P>
While the final list of activities will not be announced until Aug. 7, a 
preliminary list has been compiled for The Times. Much of the work is, indeed, 
uncharted territory, since anyone willing to produce their own event is welcome 
and no curatorial standards whatsoever are imposed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Open Festival will definitely be different for most people in that it's 
not curated," said coordinator Aaron Paley, who also organized the 1987 Fringe 
Festival, precursor to the Open Festival. "Nobody sat back and made the 
decisions for you. Because of that (individuals) have to make their own 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
For many, those decisions may not be easy. The Open Festival's preliminary list 
includes everything from a traditional presentation of the ballet "Giselle," 
with principal dancers from the Bolshoi to perform with Palos Verdes Ballet, to 
the Southwest Museum's music and dance party "Fandango," to the performance 
"Urbanites Evolve!" in which an "earth carnival" is created in an abandoned 
mortar-shell bunker at San Pedro's Angels Gate Park. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the L.A. Festival's Sellars, creating such a hodgepodge of 
events was exactly the intent. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal of the L.A. Festival is to make the point of what the arts are doing 
in L.A. and that we are at a critical, historical time," Sellars said. "The 
only way that could be done was through sheer density -- just utter critical 
mass. But needless to say, we couldn't pay for everything, so the Open Festival 
is wonderful, because it allows these people to be a part of the scene." 
</P>
<P>
Paley said that he feels his preliminary program list -- which includes 600 
events by 750 artists and groups at an estimated 400 sites -- really captures 
that "L.A. scene." While critics of the curated festival have noted its 
dance-heavy program leaves little room for events in such categories as music 
and traditional theater, for instance, Paley noted that both categories are 
well represented in the Open Festival, which has 110 music programs and 143 
traditional theater events scheduled so far. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, while Sellars has maintained for more than a year that "absolutely 
no European programming" would be included in his curated festival, the Open 
Festival includes plays by Bertolt Brecht and Shakespeare, as well as several 
music programs featuring works by Mozart, Brahms and Liszt. 
</P>
<P>
Other works cover topics from AIDS to racial discrimination to gay/lesbian 
issues, and projects include science fiction murals and international dance 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
While Paley said the Open Festival will produce a brochure listing all its 
events (to be available in late August) and will also have information on all 
programs via a festival hot line ((213) 688-ARTS, beginning Aug. 13), Sellars 
noted that selecting highlights from the mammoth Open Festival lineup may still 
be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"You may have to get through five dreadful things to find one wonderful thing, 
but it's worth it to go through the bad to find that one wonderful treasure," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a selection of potential highlights from the preliminary list: 
</P>
<P>
In the 161-event visual arts category, which Paley noted had grown dramatically 
from 1987's Fringe Festival: Guillermo Bert's "Altar / Temple Project, 
Recycling Social Images" at Los Angeles Theater Center; Self-Help Graphics' 
"Fire Show VIII" featuring 12 artists; and "Humanitas," a video installation 
created by high-school students under the direction of controversial artist 
Cheri Gaulke. 
</P>
<P>
Also grouped under the visual arts umbrella: a two-hour walking tour of 
historic movie theaters on downtown's Broadway; Rika Ohara's interdisciplinary 
installation depicting a nuclear bomb shelter at downtown's Zenshuji Soto 
Mission; a multilocation show by the metaphysically oriented group "Shamanart"; 
an exhibition of ikebana flower arrangements at San Marino's Church of World 
Messianity. 
</P>
<P>
In the theater category, which represents the second-largest body of 
programming next to the visual arts: Odyssey Theatre Ensemble's world premiere 
of Steven Berkoff's comedy "Acapulco"; the All Saints Theatre Company's "Madame 
Mao's Memories," in which Mao Tse-tung's widow reminisces about her life from a 
prison cell; and UC Irvine's one-act play "The Death of Elizabeth," in which an 
artist decides to destroy her work rather than let her patron interfere with 
its content. 
</P>
<P>
Other theater programs: Sierra Puppet Theater's "Coyote Tales," featuring 
stories from American Indian tribes, at the Santa Monica Public Library; LATC's 
new American play "August 29," about the death of Times reporter Ruben Salazar; 
Michael Kearns and Dale Raoul in the AIDS benefit "Forget Me Not" at the Chapel 
of St. Francis; the Mean Street Ensemble Theatre's "Tracers," dealing with 
eight men's experiences in the Vietnam War; and Melanie Jones' one-woman comedy 
"Loud Mouth Chowder," about a struggling actress' journey home to her parents' 
funeral, at Angels' Gate Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
In the music category: the L.A. Baroque Orchestra's program "The Splendor of 
the Baroque" at St. Victor's Church; a Pacific Asia Museum performance of 
pieces by Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin and Liszt by pianist Michael Sellers; 
"Exultate!" featuring selections by Mozart, Kraft, Wagner, Offenbach and 
Bellini at the Pacific Design Center; and "Alternative Jazz and Chamber Music: 
The Learning Curve," in which former Oingo Boingo keyboardist Michael Basich 
will attempt to bridge the gap between contemporary jazz fusion, New Age and 
experimental jazz, at Long Beach's System M Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
In the 62-event performance art category: "Dissections: Anatomy of Rage," in 
which a seven-member cast engages the audience in discussions about rape, AIDS 
and incest, at the World Stage; Keith Antar Mason's "The Body Within: 
Confrontation," exploring the line between belonging to one culture and living 
in exile from another, at Barnsdall Park's Gallery Theatre; and Sheila Gordon's 
"New York: Sex, Killing and Shopping," at Santa Monica's Rayello. 
</P>
<P>
In the 46-event dance category: "Second Annual East L.A. Choreographer's 
Showcase" and "Dance Kaleidoscope Awards Performance," both at Cal State L.A.; 
"Korean Folk Arts Festival" at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre; and the Iguana 
Cafe's "Pas d'ASL," in which American Sign Language for the deaf is adapted 
into poetry and expressive dance. 
</P>
<P>
In the 33-event media arts category: a historic film on the California missions 
narrated by Martin Sheen at the Southwest Museum; and "Profiles of California 
Artists," a one-hour video compilation profiling California artists, to be 
screened on local cable stations by the Fellows of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
In the 24-program family events category: an artist-designed miniature-golf 
course at Highland Park's new Arroyo Arts Collective; the martial spectacles of 
the Shanghai Acrobats and the Imperial Warriors of the Peking Opera at the

PRAUNHEIM TRILOGY TAKES ON THE AIDS CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
German filmmaker Rosa von Praunheim's "Silence=Death" and "Positive" (at the 
Nuart through Saturday) compose the first two-thirds of a new trilogy which 
promises to be the most comprehensive documentary yet on the response to the 
AIDS crises. The first two parts are centered in New York, the last part in 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years, Praunheim, who bears more than a passing resemblance to 
Arnold Schwarzenegger and whose real name is Holger Mischwitzki, has chronicled 
the gay experience in America and Germany with a candor and openness that has 
often invited controversy. This also means that he has been in the vanguard of 
the gay liberation movement, and four years ago, his "A Virus Respects No 
Morals," a savage, imaginative, scattershot Brecht-like allegory set largely in 
a gay bath, became one of the earliest and most provocative attacks on the 
hypocrisy, ignorance, politics and economics surrounding the AIDS crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Praunheim is just the man for the job he has taken on with 
"Silence=Death" and "Positive": he has the breadth of vision, the compassion 
and the militance and, yes, the sense of humor necessary to tackle the AIDS 
epidemic in all its aspects. 
</P>
<P>
What emerges is a portrait of a much-beleaguered minority learning how to 
organize in the face of a society and a government that has regarded AIDS with 
much indifference and downright hostility. (The key villains of the two films 
are inevitably former President Ronald Reagan and former New York Mayor Edward 
Koch.) 
</P>
<P>
Praunheim makes a very strong case for all gays still closeted to come out and 
join the struggle to press for a cure for the disease and for more education in 
regard to its prevention, especially at a time when gay bashing is on the rise 
and when the far right and various religious groups seem determined to view 
AIDS as a fit punishment for homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"Silence=Death" focuses on AIDS and the arts, while "Positive" deals with AIDS 
and politics; Praunheim being Praunheim, you can be sure some X-rated, though 
safe, sex is involved in both films. The participants in the first film range 
from poets to filmmakers to fashion designers to painters. The most vivid 
presence in the first film is poet-filmmaker David Wojnarowicz, who has tested 
HIV positive and requests that his corpse be dumped on the White House steps. 
On a calmer note, Allen Ginsberg and late Keith Haring contribute to the plea 
for safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
Both films are suffused with the rage of their participants, and in "Positive" 
Wojnarowicz's counterpart is pioneering AIDS activist Larry Kramer, who has 
also tested HIV positive; both describe themselves as unapologetically 
"hysterical" in their anger. Just as "Silence=Death" shows a wide range of 
talented men contributing their respective arts to the cause, "Positive" argues 
for the need for gays to hit the streets and protest the government's slow 
response to the AIDS crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The films show gay men not merely changing their sexual practices and gathering 
information about the disease but also discovering a common unity and identity. 
If there is a consolation in the face of such devastating losses, it is that 
AIDS has led to gays demanding greater participation in society rather than to 
retreating from it. One of the last men interviewed in "Positive" says he 
regards AIDS as "our Pearl Harbor" and that "we will win the war."

A U.S. human rights group charged today that Israeli army regulations encourage 
soldiers to open fire on Palestinians in the occupied territories with little 
fear of being punished. 
</P>
<P>
In a report titled "The Israeli Army and the Intifada: Policies that Contribute 
to the Killings," the New York-based Middle East Watch accused the military of 
failing to adequately investigate deaths caused by army gunfire and prosecute 
soldiers suspected of abuses. 
</P>
<P>
The report's conclusions were similar to those of the Israeli human rights 
group B'Tselem.

<P>
On the fourth try, a newly repaired Atlas rocket blasted off today with a 
satellite that will splash the sky with colorful cloud displays while 
illuminating Earth's usually invisible magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
The 143-foot unmanned rocket roared into a clear sky on time at 12:21 p.m., PDT 
from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The satellite was expected to separate 
from the booster 28 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth attempt by NASA and rocket builder General Dynamics to launch 
the Atlas, the first commercial version of the rocket ever flown. 
</P>
<P>
Workers on Tuesday replaced a bad power transfer switch in the Atlas rocket. 
Monday's scheduled launch was called off after the Atlas failed to transfer 
power just before liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
Bad weather forced postponement of Sunday's launch attempt and a helium leak 
was responsible for Friday's unsuccessful try. 
</P>
<P>
The rocket carries the $189-million Combined Release and Radiation Effects 
Satellite, bound for an elliptical orbit 217 miles by 22,236 miles high. The 
satellite is a joint program of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration and the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-ton satellite contains barium, lithium and other chemicals that will be 
ejected into space at various altitudes over the next year. The sun's 
ultraviolet rays will ionize the chemicals, creating large, glowing clouds that 
will spread along Earth's invisible magnetic field lines. 
</P>
<P>
The clouds are expected to resemble the aurora borealis, or the northern 
lights. The displays will be visible on Earth to the naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
The satellite originally was to have been deployed by astronauts aboard 
Challenger, but the shuttle's destruction in a 1986 explosion pushed back all 
shuttle missions. NASA and the Air Force opted for a quicker ride aboard a 
commercial Atlas 1 rocket, and the satellite was redesigned to fit inside it. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, NASA said the space shuttle Atlantis faces a trip back to the 
hangar for repairs, throwing shuttle flight plans into even more disarray, if 
engineers determine a hydrogen leak that reappeared Wednesday makes it unsafe 
to fly. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle's classified Pentagon flight is on hold, along with Columbia's 
astronomy mission, pending analysis of Wednesday's tests. Columbia also is 
crippled by a hydrogen leak.

$550,000 STRADIVARIUS VIOLIN STOLEN AT AIRPORT, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Stradivarius violin valued at $550,000 was reported stolen from a baggage 
cart at Los Angeles International Airport, but police said the thief probably 
did not know what he was taking. 
</P>
<P>
The rare instrument, along with a second Hirsch violin valued at $8,000, was 
taken from concert violinist Erich Gruenberg after he arrived from England via 
British Airways Tuesday afternoon, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
"They were taken off a cart after he cleared customs," said Detective William 
Martin, the LAPD's specialist in art theft, who was assigned the case. 
Gruenberg apparently left the cart briefly after rolling it outside the 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just devastated," Gruenberg, a 65-year-old Austrian-born violinist who 
lives in London, said Wednesday of the loss of the Stradivarius. "It is 
irreplaceable." 
</P>
<P>
The case containing the instruments was rectangular, not shaped like a violin. 
Martin said the thief or thieves probably believed that they were stealing 
luggage. "Unless they had X-ray vision they couldn't know what was inside," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Police statistics show that there have been an average 181 thefts a month at 
the airport so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
Gruenberg, who had journeyed to Los Angeles with his wife, had served as 
concertmaster of the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic.

45,000 IN HONG KONG RUSH TO MEET DEADLINE FOR ESCAPING TO BRITAIN

Tens of thousands of people mobbed Hong Kong's Immigration Department today, 
the last day to apply for permission to move to Britain and escape Communist 
rule when the British colony reverts to China in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Laborers, doctors, clerks, homemakers and teachers squeezed into a line that 
snaked hundreds of yards through downtown Hong Kong. At least 50 people had 
spent the night, and several children fainted in the hot, humid weather. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials estimated that at least 45,000 people stood in line. By 9 
p.m., 9,673 heads of households had applied for the nationality package, they 
said. This was in addition to an estimated 26,000 who submitted applications in 
previous days. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't apply, we'll lose out and become poor like all Communists," said 
John Lam, a 41-year-old office manager in a trading house, who had been waiting 
for six hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing this for my son," he said, pointing to a baby sleeping in a pink 
stroller. 
</P>
<P>
The British government is offering about 225,000 Hong Kong residents the right 
to live in Britain. According to Hong Kong immigration officials, about 3.5 
million of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people are eligible for consideration under 
the package. 
</P>
<P>
Already more than 1,000 people a week are emigrating, mainly to Australia and 
Canada, because they fear a loss of rights and opportunities when Hong Kong 
comes under Chinese rule. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers waiting in line today carried children strapped to their chests. Old 
women leaned on walkers and business people spoke into portable phones, cutting 
deals as they waited their turn. 
</P>
<P>
C. B. Chan, assistant director of immigration, said the department would stay 
open until midnight to accommodate the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
To gain consideration under the British nationality package, applicants first 
have to become permanent residents of Hong Kong. That is achieved by birth, by 
marriage or by living and working in the territory for a certain number of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Once they become permanent residents, they can apply for the right to live in 
Britain.

An East German spy posing as a waiter served former President Ronald Reagan and 
used a secret infrared device to beam intelligence reports across the Berlin 
Wall, a West Berlin newspaper said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Berliner Morgenpost, quoting security authorities, said the 58-year-old 
man, now under arrest, worked for a service firm hired regularly by West 
Berlin's Senate to cater official receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Among prominent guests on whom he eavesdropped were Reagan, who visited West 
Berlin as President in 1982 and 1987, West German President Richard von 
Weizsaecker and the military governors of the three Western allies in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Police searching the suspect's house on the Western side of the Berlin Wall 
discovered a device for transmitting infrared beams to East Berlin's Ministry 
of State Security.

Nelson Mandela said today the African National Congress will halt its armed 
struggle as soon as the government meets its demands for political reforms, and 
possibly sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela indicated the ANC might accept a government commitment to change, 
rather than insisting on the reforms being implemented before armed action 
ceases. 
</P>
<P>
"The government must remove all the obstacles. Then we will suspend the armed 
struggle," Mandela said, adding that the timing of the cease-fire is 
negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
But Mandela also said, "As long as apartheid is the case, the armed struggle 
will go on." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC National Executive Committee decided at a two-day meeting that it will 
definitely suspend all armed activities once the obstacles have been removed, 
he said. He added that ANC guerrillas have not killed anyone since talks with 
the government began in May.

Ministry officials said Israel told the Swedish Foreign Ministry of the

The British government today cleared British Airways PLC's planned linkup with 
the Belgian carrier Sabena World Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The European Commission previously objected to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The decision announced by Britain's Department of Trade and Ministry follows a 
British Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation which found that 
British Airways' intended 20% stake in Sabena would not operate against the 
public interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabena deal also calls for KLM Royal Dutch Airways to take a 20% stake in 
the Belgian airline, which would be 60%-owned by the Belgian 
government-controlled parent company Sabena SA. 
</P>
<P>
British Airways and KLM were each to pay about $62 million for their stakes. 
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, which safeguard's competition in Europe, decided in 
June that the deal could hurt competition at the Brussels airport, and the 
original agreement now is to be renegotiated through talks with the EC.

CHRYSLER TO SHIFT JEEP PRODUCTION TO OHIO

<P>
Chrysler Corp. and local and state officials announced today an agreement to 
bring more Jeep production and possibly hundreds of jobs to Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Michael Glusac said Chrysler will move production of the 
Wrangler YJ from Brampton, Ontario, to Toledo starting Jan. 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said that if it decides to build the new JJ model, it will be 
produced in Toledo by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the city and state will provide an incentive package that could 
total $22.5 million over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement meets Chrysler's needs as well as the needs of the city and 
state for a framework for determining the future of Jeep in Toledo," Glusac 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Market conditions must ultimately govern our decisions about what vehicles we 
make, where we make them and in what volume. However, the agreement being 
announced gives us assurances about what Chrysler can expect in the years 
ahead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company already makes the Jeep Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer in Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor John McHugh said he would ask the City Council to grant Chrysler a 
10-year tax abatement on personal property taxes on an estimated $75-million 
worth of equipment the company expects to install at its two Toledo plants. The 
equipment would be for production of both vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Toledo agreed to provide up to $500,000 a year for seven years starting in 1991 
for improvements to the plants. 
</P>
<P>
The state agreed to provide up to $5 million for retraining workers. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is the final piece of a package that was needed to move Jeep 
Wrangler production to Toledo from Brampton and keep the two local plants 
operating beyond 1992. The plants employ 5,300 people.

Digital Equipment Corp. said today it lost $256.7 million in the final quarter 
of its fiscal year, citing $400 million in costs related to a restructuring 
that reportedly will reduce employment by about 5,500 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Vice President John F. Smith said the results reflect "the continuing 
economic slowdown that affects both U.S. and several other markets." 
</P>
<P>
For its fourth quarter ended June 30, the company said it lost $2.11 a share on 
revenue of $3.4 billion, compared with earnings of $313.2 million, or $2.51 a 
share, on revenue of $12.7 billion for the same quarter in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasing profit is the most important challenge the company faces," Smith 
said. "We are not satisfied with our operating results and will continue 
focusing on revenue growth and reducing our cost structure." 
</P>
<P>
He said the company is reducing costs by identifying positions that are no 
longer needed, either because of changes in technology or business practices.

COLUMBIA SELLS ITS JUNK BONDS FOR $3 BILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Hills-based Columbia Savings and Loan Assn. said today it will sell its 
huge junk bond portfolio to Gordon America L.P. for $3 billion, erasing some of 
the uncertainty surrounding the big thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Financially troubled Columbia began accepting bids for its high-yield bond 
portfolio, the largest held by any thrift, valuing it at $3.5 billion earlier 
this year, although many were skeptical it could unload the holdings in a 
depressed market. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the bonds, which was required under new thrifts regulations, will 
aid the federal government in its bailout of Columbia and cut into any 
liability that taxpayers might have. 
</P>
<P>
More than any other savings and loan, Columbia's rise and fall has paralleled 
the movement of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Its high-yielding junk bond investments made it the most profitable thrift in 
the country for a time. But when the bonds lost value, Columbia's fortunes also 
plunged. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming the downturn in the market over the past year, Columbia has reported $1 
billion in losses and said it was technically insolvent. It went through a 
series of management changes as its fortunes fell. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said Columbia's deal to sell the junk bonds is a sign of market's 
improving health. The wide interest in the portfolio came after some figured it 
would not be able to sell the portfolio at any reasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
"Columbia, together with its financial adviser, The First Boston Corp., 
received expressions from over 50 potential investors," said Edward Harshfield, 
president and chief executive officer of Columbia.

Japan has overtaken the United States to become the world's biggest spender on 
new factories and industrial equipment, according to a new study on America's 
flagging performance in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an economy less than half the size of that of its American economic 
rival, Japan spent $36 billion more on capital investment in 1989 than the 
United States: $549 billion vs. 
</P>
<P>
$513 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"This marks the first time that any country has out-invested the United States 
in plant and equipment in absolute terms since World War II," the study by the 
Washington-based Council of Competitiveness said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, U.S. investment in plant and equipment has consistently 
fallen below the average of the other Group of Seven countries over the last 
two decades.

Actor Paul Winfield did his homework for his role in "Presumed Innocent," 
according to the judge who was his role model. 
</P>
<P>
"He picked up that feeling of the courtroom, with lawyers going back and forth, 
trying to get in evidence they know they shouldn't get in, the exasperation you 
feel," District Judge Willie G. Lipscomb said at a screening of the new film. 
</P>
<P>
"Presumed Innocent," about a deputy prosecutor accused of murdering a 
colleague, made its national debut Tuesday night at the Detroit Institute of 
Arts. The movie, starring Harrison Ford, was filmed partially in Detroit, 
although the book by Scott Turow was set in a mythical Illinois city. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield observed Lipscomb's court before playing the judge in the film. 
</P>
<P>
"Presumed Innocent," which opens nationwide Friday, also stars Raul Julia and 
Greta Scacchi.

SPIDERS GET BAD NAME IN MOVIE, EXPERT SAYS

<P>
"Arachnophobia" is bugging Dr. Michael H. Robinson, a spider expert who accuses 
Hollywood of spinning a web of deceit about his favorite creepy-crawly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity to give spiders a bad name," says Robinson, director of the 
National Zoo and former director of the American Arachnological Society. 
</P>
<P>
"This bloody movie is making horrific allegations about spiders, and they are 
so important to the ecology of the world and so incredibly beneficial to 
mankind that I decided they need some good press," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson hailed spiders as nature's pest exterminator, ridding the Earth of 
billions of houseflies, roaches, mosquitoes and other insects every year. 
</P>
<P>
Without spiders, he said, humans would be overwhelmed by winged creatures that 
would destroy crops and threaten to leave the planet uninhabitable.

That sex scandal is flaring up again for Peter Graf, the father of West German 
tennis star Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole Meissner, 22, a model known primarily for posing nude, was released from 
jail Tuesday and again said that Peter Graf is the father of her child. 
</P>
<P>
Meissner first made the accusation in June but then retracted the statement, 
which led to reports that Graf had paid her a large sum of money. West German 
authorities arrested Meissner and a boxing promoter, Eberhard Thust, on charges 
of attempted blackmail but Meissner was released. 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf was so upset about the scandal and media coverage she has 
threatened to leave West Germany and move to the United States and also said 
her defeat at the French Open in Paris in June was partly due to the scandal.

"If you're going into law to make money you're going to have a very miserable 
old age," Belli, who turns 83 on Sunday, said while in San Diego recently for a

"But if you're going into it to help people, what a life it is. I can't think 
of anything more rewarding."

Belli's clients have included Jack Ruby, who killed John F. Kennedy assassin 
Lee Harvey Oswald, and Jim and Tammy Bakker.

Belli has written 62 books and dabbles in acting. He will soon appear in an

A misplaced caddie cost Doug Miller a two-stroke penalty and a course record.

<P>
Miller, a 28-year-old assistant pro from East Norwich, N.Y., shot a 5-under-par 
66 to take the lead in the partially completed first round of the New York 
State Open on Tuesday, but it should have been a course-record 64 on the 
difficult Bethpage State Park's Black course. 
</P>
<P>
He was penalized when he was unable to restart on time after a three-hour 
morning rain delay because his caddie didn't show up on the third hole with his 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"He was waiting inside for me," Miller said. "We crossed signals a bit. It's my 
fault. It's the player's responsibility."

NFL REPORTEDLY WILL EXPAND BY TWO TEAMS FOR 1993 SEASON

<P>
The NFL is expected to announce Thursday or Friday that it will expand by two 
teams in the 1993 season and that the new cities will be announced next year, a 
newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur (Chick) Sherrer, president of Touchdown Jacksonville Inc., which is 
trying to bring an expansion franchise to Jacksonville, said team owners and 
representatives of the league office had told him the announcement would be 
made this week, The Florida Times-Union said in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Heffernan, NFL director of public relations, confirmed Sherrer's 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
"You're on firm ground with that, yes," Heffernan said. 
</P>
<P>
An owners meeting scheduled for Chicago Thursday was called off, and any 
matters that require a vote will be done by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The league last expanded in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best news we've heard since we started in the NFL derby. This 
formal process makes expansion a definite reality,' Sherrer said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Jacksonville, other cities seeking expansion teams are 
Baltimore, St. Louis, Memphis, Charlotte, N.C., and possibly Oakland, depending 
on the status of the Raiders.

The head of the Soviet ice hockey delegation to the Goodwill Games lashed out 
at the Detroit Red Wings professional ice hockey team, saying they had robbed 
his team of a young star. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings of the National Hockey League announced Tuesday that Sergei 
Fyodorov, 20, had arrived in Detroit with the help of the team and applied to 
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for a work permit so he could 
play with them. 
</P>
<P>
"We insist on the return of Fyodorov to the team. He should participate in the 
Goodwill Games as part of the Soviet team," Yuri Korolov, the first vice 
president of the Soviet ice hockey federation, told a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"What upsets me is the thievery." 
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov left the hotel where the Soviet team was staying during exhibition 
games in Portland, Ore., late Sunday night before the squad departed for 
Kennewick, where the Goodwill Games ice hockey competition will be held. 
</P>
<P>
"From the hotel was taken a Soviet hockey player. We were surprised. We now 
have a guarantee from the U.S.A. for the safeguard of all of the players of the 
Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, a player has disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
Red Wings spokesman Howard Berlin said in Detroit that the NHL team had been 
talking to Fyodorov about coming to play ever since the Soviet center was 
drafted by the franchise in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov's move to Detroit was a "mutual" effort, Berlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Korolov said the federation might try to bring family pressure on Fyodorov. 
</P>
<P>
"The methods of the Detroit club have had a negative impact on our 
relationship. We're ready to bring his family, his father here," Korolov said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the players that has the potential of being a great player."

J. Bruce Llewellyn, the chairman and chief executive officer of the 
Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co., says he is interested in buying the New 
York Yankees if George Steinbrenner is forced to sell the team, New York 
Newsday reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Llewellyn has previously tried to buy the Seattle Mariners and the Baltimore 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
If successful in purchasing the Yankees, he would become the first black owner 
of a major league baseball club. Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. is the 
third-largest black-owned business in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The Yankees would be a great property, and they have great potential," 
Llewellyn said. "But they've been abused for the last dozen years." 
</P>
<P>
To succeed, Llewellyn would have to overcome a number of obstacles. First of 
all, baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent would have to force Steinbrenner to sell 
the team as punishment for his dealings with gambler Howard Spira. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Steinbrenner has said that he will not sell, even if he's suspended from 
baseball.

These are the big numbers in baseball, the really big ones that define its 
history, heroes and Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
There's 500 home runs. Babe Ruth became the first of 14 players to hit that 
many and someday Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire, Darryl Strawberry and Darryl 
Strawberry Jr. might, too. 
</P>
<P>
There's 3,000 hits, and the 15 batters to get there. George Brett and Robin 
Yount are up soon, Wade Boggs and Tony Gwynn are on deck and Anthony Keith 
Gwynn II could be in the future. 
</P>
<P>
There's 300 victories, and the 19 pitchers to win so many. Nolan Ryan will be 
next, possibly tonight, and Bert Blyleven needs just 21 more. 
</P>
<P>
But after Ryan and Blyleven, who else? In this era, what pitcher will be able 
to find the formula that equals 20 victories for 15 years? 
</P>
<P>
"Once they do it, that's all you're ever going to have," Phil Niekro said. 
"You're not going to see any more." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 19 major leaguers to win 300 games, 12 did it exclusively in this 
century. Of that dozen, five of them -- Niekro, Steve Carlton, Tom Seaver, 
Gaylord Perry and Don Sutton -- got No. 300 in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
What a sudden end it would be if Ryan and Blyleven became the last of the big 
winners. But not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"The game has changed so much, especially for pitchers," Niekro said. "There 
are no more 300-inning pitchers. There aren't so many 20-game winners. It's 
just different now." 
</P>
<P>
In every way, it adds up to under 300 wins. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
* It used to be, back when complete games were commonplace, that starting 
pitchers got all of the decisions. Now, in an age of specialization, middle 
relievers and stoppers get their share. Ryan, for example, between 1972 and 
'77, made 223 starts and got a win or loss in 205 (92%), while pitching 125 
complete games. In the past five years, he got decisions in 115 of 164 starts 
(70%) with just 15 complete games. 
</P>
<P>
* It used to be that pitchers never got injured, or at least -- for better or 
worse -- never said they were hurt. Now, the disabled list is dotted with 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan was on the disabled list a total of three times until 1983. Since then, 
he's been out of action seven times. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be routine for kids to turn pro straight out of high school and 
reach the big leagues as teen-agers. Now, more players go to college and don't 
make the majors until their mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan had just finished his senior year at Alvin High School when he signed with 
the New York Mets in 1965. He made his big league debut the next year at age 
19. 
</P>
<P>
"The money also makes a difference," Niekro said. "You don't have to stick 
around for a lot of years, hoping to make a million dollars. You can make that 
right away these days, and you don't need to hang around, punishing your body." 
</P>
<P>
That's how Early Wynn did it. He was cut by the Chicago White Sox after the 
1962 season with 299 victories and got No. 300 with Cleveland in 1963. He 
reached the milestone in his seventh try, struggling for five innings for his 
last major league victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated that it happened that way," Wynn said. "But the even number of 300 is 
different. There are a lot of pitchers between 200 and 300. If you get 300, 
you're assured of the Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
Wynn was eventually elected to Cooperstown in his third try. Ferguson Jenkins, 
with 284 victories, has missed for two years and who knows whether Tommy John's 
288 wins will be enough? 
</P>
<P>
Forget Cy Young's 511 victories, baseball's only truly unbreakable record. 
Maybe it might be time to adjust the old standard of 300 victories to, say, 250 
or so. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Reuss (220), in the minors at age 41; Rick Reuschel (213), on the 
disabled list at age 41, and Frank Tanana (203) at 37 are the only active 
pitchers with over 200 victories besides Ryan, 43, and Blyleven, 39. 
</P>
<P>
So does anyone have a shot at 300? 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Gooden is 25 and already has won 110 games; only Christy Mathewson and 
Walter Johnson had won more at such an early age. Ryan had won 48 by then and 
Blyleven was at 95, while Niekro did not get his first victory until he turned 
26. 
</P>
<P>
"When I won my 100th game last season, it was something special. But a few 
weeks later, I got hurt and didn't start another game," Gooden said. "To win 
that many games, you have to pitch a long time, be with some good teams and 
stay healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Among other established pitchers, Jack Morris has 191 victories at age 35, Bob 
Welch has 164 at 33, Fernando Valenzuela has 136 at 29 and Frank Viola has 130 
at 30. 
</P>
<P>
Among recent big winners, Roger Clemens, who turns 28 next month, has won 107, 
Bret Saberhagen has won 97 at age 26 and three-time 20-game winner Dave Stewart 
has won 101 at 33. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Steve Avery. He was drafted by Atlanta in 1988 at age 18, zoomed 
through the minors at 19 and reached the majors this season at 20 as one of the 
most highly regarded pitching prospects in many years. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he's won one major league game. The possibility of 300 seems, well, 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm only thinking about No. 2," Avery said.

DANIELS LEARNS TO LIVE WITH CREEPY CO-STARS IN 'ARACHNOPHOBIA' ROLE

The way Jeff Daniels tells it, his first reaction to the proposal of a film 
called "Arachnophobia" was negative. 
</P>
<P>
"My agent called and said, 'Well, it's about spiders,' " Daniels recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Oh great! "The Attack of the Killer Spiders." Great! 
</P>
<P>
Terrific! I'll pass.' " 
</P>
<P>
When the agent explained that co-producers Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy and 
Steven Spielberg were involved in the project, Daniels agreed to read the 
script. And liked it. His verdict: "If anybody can do this in a first-class 
way, those guys can." 
</P>
<P>
After years of directing second unit on Spielberg films, Frank Marshall made 
his debut as director with "Arachnophobia." Besides the human actors -- 
Daniels, John Goodman, Julian Sands and Harley Jane Kozak -- Marshall directed 
hundreds of spiders that invade a small California town. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind the little guys," Daniels said. "I'm pretty much a manly man when 
it comes to that sort of thing. But the big boys, nine inches across with the 
legs spread out, . . . spit at you." 
</P>
<P>
"They had a 'spider orientation' on the second day of shooting. We were all 
supposed to go and basically learn how to become friends with the spiders and 
have them crawl on you as pets. I blew that off. If we're supposed to be afraid 
of spiders, let's be afraid of spiders. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any opportunity at all to eliminate acting I'm all for it. In the 
second half of this movie, there's not a lot of acting going on. It's personal 
terror."

<P>
Pianist Max Levinson, 18, didn't have second thoughts about electing to be an 
English major at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is the most important thing for me, but I also felt it was important to 
get a broad-based education, which does have a very large effect on how I 
approach music," Levinson said Monday from his parents' home in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, if I understand that a Romantic composer may have felt that 
man's nature was fundamentally emotional, to know that, I understand a little 
bit better how one should approach a piece of Romantic music. 
</P>
<P>
"Mozart, on the other hand, came out of an era in which man's nature was 
believed to be more rational, and so the art is more rational. It's important 
to know those things." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson has picked music that reflects the emotional side of man's nature -- 
works by Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin and Debussy -- for a recital Thursday, part 
of the Seal Beach Music Festival series. 
</P>
<P>
Levinson, who played with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1985 and won, as a 
member of the Trio con Brio, the 1988 Coleman Chamber Music Competition, began 
playing the piano when he was 5, but it was not the only instrument that 
interested him. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time I was 8 until about 17, I also studied very seriously the 
cello," he said. "I studied them equally and had about equal success on both of 
them, however you can define success. 
</P>
<P>
"But I decided about a year ago, in order to really succeed on either 
instrument, I'd have to focus on one. I decided I want to focus my life on my 
piano playing." 
</P>
<P>
Some young pianists hedge about their musical preferences, but not Levinson. 
"There are definitely composers that I really like more than others," he said. 
"The ones I like the best are probably Bach, Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin, 
Brahms, and some of the second Viennese school, (such as) Schoenberg and Berg. 
</P>
<P>
"But I haven't really decided to pigeonhole myself in terms of repertory or 
some kind of composers." 
</P>
<P>
To Levinson, the music of Schoenberg and Berg does not represent "so much of a 
big jump" from the Germanic romanticism of Schumann and Brahms. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the music of Berg, especially, and also Schoenberg, is very emotional, 
full of a kind of Angst and a kind of intensity that can really not be 
expressed in any other way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with his studies at Harvard, Levinson manages to practice "at least five 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really what I need in order to do as well as I would like," he said. 
"Basically, that's my priority, finding enough time to practice. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I never practice scales or things like that, just repertory I'm working on. I 
try to look at it from different angles. One way is to analyze the work 
harmonically, like we all learn in music theory classes, and there are 
different ways of doing that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But I think that your particular style of analysis, what aspects of the music 
jump out at you -- rhythmic, harmonic or motivic things -- are what make you 
the particular artist you are. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain things I notice in the music, which pretty much define my 
personality. I couldn't say what they are . . . a lot of people think I'm a 
very intense, concentrated and focused player. I couldn't say." 
</P>
<P>
When Levinson is not practicing, he's likely to be reading "good literature, 
which is why, basically, I decided to be an English major. 
</P>
<P>
"That in a way is a kind of release. I don't consider it studying or working. 
The same goes for music. I enjoy it so much, while practicing or listening to 
recordings, it doesn't feel like working." 
</P>
<P>
As for studying other pianists through recordings, Levinson said, "I usually 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
"My least favorite things to listen to are recordings of other pianists," he 
said. "I've formed such a strong opinion myself of how the piano ought to be 
played, it's hard to enjoy listening to anyone else playing it." 
</P>
<P>
But singers are another matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I love listening to singers, such as (Dietrich) Fischer-Dieskau," he said. 
"That's my favorite thing to listen to. Plus recordings of orchestral and 
chamber music, especially music I can't possibly play because it doesn't 
include the piano. 
</P>
<P>
"I always aspire to sound like the voice or an orchestra, something that I can 
enjoy without having to think about it or comparing myself." 
</P>
<P>
For his Thursday recital, Levinson picked "a fairly balanced program . . . and 
all of the music I really love." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson will play works by Brahms, Chopin and Debussy on a program that opens 
with Beethoven's "Appassionata" Sonata. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of the 'Appassionata' is, for me personally, not being carried 
away with the appassionata character of the work," he said. "If you give 
everything you have, and particularly if it's the first work on the program, 
every minute of the 20 minutes it takes you, the effect of the intensity is 
kind of deadening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a wonderful work, you want to bring out every single nuance and 
wonderful moment. Personally, I have to guard against that. So you have to 
decide what to bring out." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson will close with Chopin's G-minor Ballade. "It's so wonderfully written 
for the piano, if you can only play what Chopin wants you to play, there's no 
problem for the performer," he said, with a self-deprecating laugh. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Levinson is wary about whether he will pursue a career in music. 
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, I want to progress in trying to keep getting performances 
and just have more and more people hear me and take lessons to improve the way 
I play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, making a career involves a lot of luck. (But) luck strikes more 
often than you think. I think it's a matter of being prepared for it when it 
strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Max Levinson will play works by Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin and Debussy 
at 8 p.m. Thursday at the McGaugh School auditorium, 1695 Bolsa Ave., Seal 
Beach. The free program is part of the Seal Beach Chamber Music Festival. 
Information: (213) 596-4749.

THE WOMAN BEHIND 'NAVY SEALS'; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: A RADICAL FEMINIST PRODUCER CALLS THE SHOTS IN THE MACHO 
ACTION-THRILLER. 'I THINK IT IS FEMINIST, HUMANIST TO HATE TERRORISM,' SHE 
SAYS.

"Barrooooom!" A ramshackle Beirut building collapses in a cloud of blazing 
orange flame. "Ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak!" The sub-machine guns and Kalishnikov rifles 
spit fire and death. "Craaaack!" Blood spurts and brains splatter as one of the 
good guys is executed by a Middle Eastern terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Orion's "Navy SEALS," the latest entry in this summer's parade of 
action-adventure films where the body count and expletives run high and the 
prop blood flows freely. Like most of the others, this is a mostly men-only 
story, the one female role could be filled by a man. The love interest: nil. 
The main relationship is one where co-stars Charlie Sheen and Michael Biehn try 
to out-tough one another. Weapons, tough guys, more blood, more bodies. "Tag 
'em and bag 'em," says one character. 
</P>
<P>
But wait a minute. On the screen credits, we see this: "A Brenda Feigen 
Production." Brenda Feigen? The Brenda Feigen? The to-the-barricades radical 
feminist of the '60s and '70s? What on earth is she doing producing a film 
light-years from what one thinks of as a "woman's" movie, a film that 
celebrates with a vengeance a gung-ho organization that is one of the very few 
military operations left still prohibiting women (because of its state of 
constant combat readiness)? 
</P>
<P>
The SEALS, by the way, are an elite force of 1,200 men, descended from World 
War II's Frogmen (a term they still use for themselves) and created in 1962 by 
John F. Kennedy, who saw a future need for highly-trained teams that could be 
mobilized fast for hazardous reconnaissance and counterterrorism action. 
</P>
<P>
Feigen, still a radical feminist and whose hazel eyes blaze with the intensity 
of her commitment, sees no conflict between her personal philosophy and this, 
her first film production: "If this movie had been made about dropping nuclear 
bombs, I never would have done it," she says. "But I think it is feminist, 
humanist to hate terrorism. It is natural and logical. I had no problem making 
a movie about the guys who go after these people. I may be a feminist but I 
don't want to be blown up by a terrorist's bomb any more than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
At 46, deeply tanned and with streaked blond hair, Feigen says she has been a 
feminist all her life. Her passionate commitment to the cause, however, began 
soon after she entered Harvard Law School in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
"They had 'ladies day' then," she recalls, "the one day in the year when women 
in the classes were called on. I remember in Criminal Law the professor called 
on women to discuss how much penetration constitutes rape and in Property Law 
class called on us to discuss who actually owned the engagement ring when an 
engagement is called off! Totally sexist. 
</P>
<P>
"I was instrumental in integrating Lincoln's Inn, the eating club for the law 
school that had never allowed women, and the squash courts so I wouldn't have 
to disguise myself as a man to play -- which I had been doing." 
</P>
<P>
While at Harvard she met and married classmate Marc Fasteau (they divorced in 
1987). "Just as I was graduating I was contacted by (the National Organization 
for Women) to run for national vice president for legislation," where she was 
in charge of hearings on women's legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1970, she and her husband moved to New York where Feigen and Gloria 
Steinem eventually started the Women's Action Alliance and Ms. Magazine. 
Steinem recalls the early days of the magazine: "In a way it was her idea. 
Together we had formed the Womens Action Alliance which is basically an 
information center. We were initially thinking of a newsletter and Brenda said 
no, it should be a real magazine . . . she was in on the founding." 
</P>
<P>
"I learned, many years later," Feigen smiles, "that that was what gave me the 
honor of having a CIA file started on me," which she discovered in 1976 under 
the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
Feigen then was offered the job of running the Women's Rights Project of the 
ACLU which, after two years, she left to go into a law partnership with her 
husband. In 1978, she ran for the New York State Senate from New York's 
silk-stocking district. Feigen lost by 3% to a candidate who spent $600,000 to 
her $38,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, she joined the New York office of the William Morris Agency, first as 
a business affairs attorney and then as an agent (her clients included Jane 
Alexander, Karen Allen and Loretta Swit), eventually segueing into the 
production of "Navy SEALS." "I'm glad I lost that election," she laughs, "or I 
might still be in Albany instead of having produced my first film." 
</P>
<P>
Through a writer client she met Chuck Pfarrer, an active duty SEAL writing 
screenplays in his spare time. "I tried to talk to him about it," she recalls, 
"but couldn't get much information. When the Achille Lauro happened he 
disappeared, and when the Pakistani jet was hijacked he disappeared again. He 
kept disappearing. . . . Chuck was the commander of the counter-terrorist SEAL 
team from the Atlantic Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
"The mortality rate among these guys is about 40% and I kept telling him he 
should leave." 
</P>
<P>
Pfarrer eventually did retire and wrote the first screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it to Orion," she says. "The minute they got it they called and said 
they wanted it, and by the next day it was a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Marquand was hired as director, and all was ready to go when his death 
stopped all work. By September, 1989, a new director (Lewis Teague, "Jewel of 
the Nile") was on board, and filming commenced in Spain and Norfolk, Va. "Navy 
SEALS" was made without active Navy support because of the top-secret nature of 
the SEAL's activities, said Capt. Tom Lawson, commander of the Naval Special 
Warfare Center in Coronado. "Now, they're all over it," Feigen adds. 
</P>
<P>
Feigen claims she imposed her woman's viewpoint in many places in the film. 
"There were some pretty bad things that came in a number of the drafts, and I 
said, 'I'm sorry guys, no way!' There were scenes with the role of Claire 
(co-star Joanne Whalley-Kilmer) that made no sense . . . and in one instance 
there was a reference to her so obscene I can't repeat it. . . . I said this 
has got to go! 
</P>
<P>
"In the (various) scripts there was a lot more shooting than there needed to 
be. I remember saying to Chuck, 'Don't you guys ever do anything else to keep 
people quiet?' and he said, 'Yes, but using a gun is the most efficient way.' 
The script would say things like 'and his head was blown off. . . .' I said 
that this is not going to be. As it turned out it was also cheaper," she 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
"And there was one scene where each one of the guys was with what they call 
'frog hogs,' " (a SEALS term for female groupies), "including an unnecessary 
amount of sexual activity that had nothing to do with feelings. That's all 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
Feigen adds that "the guys" also made it pretty clear to her that she would be 
in the way when they visited bars frequented by SEALS in San Diego. "When 
you're not a SEAL and not 'one of the guys,' if you are a woman producer in a 
movie like this you seem almost expendable. I took exception to that every time 
it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe if I had been a male producer there would have been no question 
about a lot of the things I had to fight for." 
</P>
<P>
Feigen's next films are far more what one would expect from a feminist: 
"Inalienable Right" is a two-hour CBS-TV movie about two black girls in the 
South sterilized without their knowledge, and based on a case she became 
familiar with while working with the ACLU; "Grounded" is a "9-to-5" type film 
about airline attendants, to be made with Jane Fonda for Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
She is also developing a film project planned to star Meg Ryan and based 
loosely on Feigen's own experiences in the early days of the women's movement. 
And there is talk of two sequels to "Navy SEALS." 
</P>
<P>
Feigen says she does regret having "Navy SEALS" as her calling card to 
Hollywood instead of one of the other projects. "I think that if you are a 
woman producer, if you get typecast as doing 'soft' movies, it's very hard to 
break that mold. 'Navy SEALS' was a film I knew I had to make because the stuff 
is so good and the story is not about nothing . . . what drew me to it was its 
substance. . . . 
</P>
<P>
" 'Total Recall' and 'Die Hard' are fantasy, futuristic movies. My film is 
action-adventure, but it's real, about real situations that could happen like 
'China Syndrome' could happen. It also happened to be the first," she smiles. 
</P>
<P>
If Feigen doesn't fit into the film industry's mold, she certainly is enjoying 
its rewards. But none of this is incompatible with her political beliefs, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is anything inconsistent with making a lot of money and 
being a feminist. I think it's important, though, to realize what your 
priorities are and who you give money to." 
</P>
<P>
And no, she doesn't intend to quit railing against the system as strongly as 
she did 25 years ago. "It's important that women have the same power as men in 
order to control the creative process -- at least have half of the control," 
she says. "There is an audience out there that does not want to see all these 
macho movies as much as they want to see movies about real people including 
real women. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to be in the forefront of trying to change this."
