NEWSMAKERS: DUKAKIS WAS UPSET HIS REPLY ON DEATH HAD NO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

Michael S. Dukakis was one of the first critics of his own unemotional answer 
to a debate question about the possibility of his wife being raped and killed. 
"I blew it," Dukakis told top aide John Sasso as he walked off the stage in Los 
Angeles after last October's debate with George Bush, according to a new book 
about the 1988 election. Dukakis' aides were baffled at his performance, 
according to the authors, because he had rehearsed an effective answer to a 
soft-on-crime question 13 times. The story is recounted in the book by 
political columnists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover, titled "Whose Broad 
Stripes and Bright Stars? The Trivial Pursuit of the Presidency 1988." Dukakis' 
widely criticized response was to a question posed by debate moderator Bernard 
Shaw of CNN, who asked if he would favor the death penalty if his own wife, 
Kitty, were raped and murdered. "No, I don't, Bernard," the candidate 
responded, in a flat voice. "And I think you know I've opposed the death 
penalty all of my life. . . . " Dukakis' seemingly unfeeling answer "captured 
the candidate's most glaring vulnerabilities" and helped put an end to his 
chances of defeating Bush, according to the book.

There is something almost pathetic in the toil of workers along the coast of 
Prince William Sound, going literally from rock to rock to wipe up the crude 
oil residue from the Exxon Valdez spill of four months ago. How many millions 
of rocks have been blighted? But hand to rock, rock by rock -- that is just 
about the only way the mess can be expunged. While the Alaskan coast might be 
stained for years in spite of the effort, the nation owes it to itself to do 
everything possible now to restore the magnificent environment to something of 
its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the arrogance of Exxon Corp. officials makes a mockery of the labors of 
10,000 men and women in cleanup support centers and strung out along the coast 
of Prince William Sound. Never mind that Exxon is paying them $18 an hour for 
their work. Many did go to Alaska for the bucks -- not that this is easy work 
by any measure. Many went because they were appalled by this environmental 
disaster and wanted to play some part in wiping out the stain. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Exxon declared it would stick with the job until it was 
done, no matter the cost. But now the world's largest energy company says it 
will halt work Sept. 15. When spring comes, Exxon says its only commitment is 
to "survey" the situation. This position is not negotiable, the company said. 
That means that if the state and federal governments don't like it, tough. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Exxon is rocked by the cost. Indeed, the memo was disclosed on the same 
day the firm announced it has already spent $600 million on the Exxon Valdez 
affair, will pay out another $250 million and has an additional $400 million 
billed to insurance carriers. The figures were met with some skepticism by 
experts, but even if the outlay is that high, Exxon still expects to make $160 
million in profit during the second quarter of 1989. The summary did not cover 
contingency funds to offset any liability that may emerge from lawsuits that 
have been filed. But it also does not consider aesthetic damage to the 
environment and the loss of wildlife, which includes 28,000 birds and 800 sea 
otters counted to date. 
</P>
<P>
The hand work obviously cannot go on during the winter, but it should continue 
beyond Sept. 15 if weather permits. Alaskan officials say pollution has been 
removed from less than 25% of the 730 miles of shoreline Exxon promised to 
clean up. Winter storms indeed may scour some of the goo from the beaches, but 
no one can be sure. If it is practical to do more cleanup work next spring, 
Exxon should have crews on the beaches the minute the weather allows. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. is correct when he says Exxon is 
responsible for full cleanup and mitigation of damages. The notion that Exxon 
should just walk away from the fouled Alaskan beaches is unacceptable. The 
disdain with which it declared its intent is base. If Exxon will not take 
Lujan's word for the government's determination that Exxon finish cleaning up 
its mess, President Bush should get on the telephone and emphasize the message 
in the sort of language that oilmen understand.

Prof. Mueller's sensible suggestion -- "Why Build New California Universities 
When Eastern Classrooms Go Begging?" -- should also be encouraged because it 
may well encourage some of the exported students to remain in the East. This 
would reap other important savings as these hopefully permanent expatriates 
reduce by that much the demand for more freeways, etc. 
</P>
<P>
But surely the good professor knows that the educational establishment, 
hellbent on empire building and jobs creation, would rather bankrupt the state 
than adopt such an eminently rational alternative approach to more and more 
campuses and hang the cost. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps Mueller, an Angeleno who studied and stayed back East, was too much 
influenced by his own experience. Too much (influenced) for his own good, 
should he abdicate the University of Rochester and try to get a university 
appointment here after "coming out of the closet" with such heretical notions. 
</P>
<P>
But nice try.

CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With two excellent if belated appointments by President Bush, the new national 
AIDS Commission is complete and ready to get to work. There is optimism that it 
will be an effective new force in facing the growing problem just at the moment 
when the total of AIDS cases in the United States has reached 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The optimism has two sources. First of all, Bush has shown a concern and a 
commitment that former President Ronald Reagan failed to provide. And, 
secondly, the quality of the commission appointments is excellent, drawing 
praise from some of the best-informed people engaged in the effort to contain 
the pandemic, free of the extremism that characterized some of the members of 
Reagan's Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
Epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
This new commission will have a running start on the problem because of the 
excellent work done by the Reagan commission under the leadership of Adm. James 
D. Watkins, now secretary of energy in the Bush Cabinet. Its report, published 
just 13 months ago but largely ignored by the Reagan Administration, provides 
an appropriate and urgent agenda for the new commission. 
</P>
<P>
A score of major recommendations and hundreds of detailed proposals emerged 
from the work of that commission. The report recognized the importance of 
prevention in the absence of a cure, the importance of early treatment of those 
with the HIV infection long before they have symptoms of AIDS and AIDS-related 
illnesses, and the importance of anti-discrimination legislation to protect the 
victims of the disease. It identified areas of reform needed in testing and 
speeding the availability of new drugs, and also the need for more research. 
Developments in the succeeding months have confirmed the wisdom of its 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has named two members to the new commission: Belinda Ann Mason, 
a young mother of two who herself was infected with HIV through a blood 
transfusion, and Dr. David E. Rogers, professor of medicine at Cornell 
University Medical College in New York City and former president of the Robert 
Wood Johnson Foundation, which has been the most generous private source of 
funding for AIDS research and health care programs. Three cabinet members also 
will serve: Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health and human services; Dick 
Cheney, secretary of defense, and Edward J. Derwinski, secretary of veteran 
affairs. The other members are Eunice Diaz, a health consultant and member of 
the Los Angeles County AIDS Commission; Rep. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.), a physician; 
Larry Kessler, executive director of the Boston AIDS Action Committee; Diane 
Ahrens, head of the Ramsey County, Minn., board of commissioners; Rev. Scott 
Allen, coordinator of the AIDS Interfaith Network in Dallas; Dr. Don C. Des 
Jarlais, an AIDS research coordinator in New York; Donald S. Goldman of 
Livingston, N.J., an attorney; Dr. June Osborn, dean of the University of 
Michigan school of public health; Harry Dalton, a Yale law professor, and Dr. 
Charles Konigsberg, director of health for the Kansas Health and Environment 
Department.

HEALTH BENEFITS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your article about Grayce Aul, who suddenly lost her health 
benefits when Allstate Life Insurance Co. decided to withdraw from the group 
insurance market and terminated her policy (Metro, July 15). Now needing 
expensive medical treatment, Aul finds that she can't get adequate insurance 
because of her pre-existing condition. This frightening tale should send a 
cautionary message to people who now take their own medical coverage for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
To those of us associated with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, 
insurance problems due to pre-existing medical conditions are all too familiar. 
Time and time again, the California Legislature has considered measures that 
would spread the risk among many insurers while making health coverage 
available to those who are medically uninsurable. Only last year, the 
Legislature approved such a plan, only to have it vetoed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Three measures in the current legislative session -- SB 6 (Robbins), AB 60 
(Isenberg) and AB 328 (Margolin) -- would make health insurance available to 
those with pre-existing medical conditions. We urge the Legislature and the 
governor to take appropriate action promptly. Otherwise, there will be many 
more stories like Grayce Aul's.

A HIGHER RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles must stop treating the Owens Valley and Mono Lake Basin as remote 
colonies that are good for just one thing: exporting their water. The city 
Department of Water and Power has an opportunity this week to recognize its 
responsibility to the environment of Inyo and Mono counties and not just the 
city's right to divert the water, which is under serious legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, efforts will be made to keep alive legislation by Assemblyman 
Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) to compensate Los Angeles by up to $100 million 
for the loss of the water needed to maintain the integrity of Mono Lake, which 
is protected by both state and federal legislation as a unique natural feature. 
And the city and Inyo County officials will seek to revise a draft ground-water 
pumping agreement to meet the reasonable requests of Owens Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
The city cannot, and need not, attempt to atone for 75 years of exploitation of 
the Owens Valley and half a century of depleting Mono Lake. But it can, and 
should, agree to real compromises to protect the environment of the eastern 
Sierra and to make at least a minimum effort to improve it. 
</P>
<P>
Under Duane Georgeson and Duane Buchholz, the department has improved relations 
with the eastern Sierra on a limited scale. The limit has been the formal legal 
position of Water and Power, which is to cling to every drop of water and every 
dollar of profit from the region (the water division netted $34 million last 
year). 
</P>
<P>
But the city must do more than squeeze water and cash from the eastern Sierra. 
For instance, in the draft agreement with Inyo County, the city pledges to 
avoid significant adverse impact with its pumping. That is not good enough, 
considering the damage done to date. As environmental groups contend, the goal 
should be to maintain and improve the vegetation of the valley, while assuring 
Los Angeles a reliable water supply. 
</P>
<P>
At Mono Lake, the city insists -- considerable scientific evidence to the 
contrary -- that no one knows how far the lake must fall before permanent 
damage is done. There is damage enough already, and the lake level must be 
stabilized. With the city's Mono Lake water rights already in jeopardy, the 
department is not likely to get a better deal than that offered by the Isenberg 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout both the Inyo and Mono affairs, there is a major gap in the city's 
position that makes it impossible for the department to fairly balance the 
environment against Los Angeles' water demand. The department's entire 
institutional history and singular purpose is to get the water. It will yield 
to environmental constraints only when forced to do so by the law and not just 
because it is the right thing to do. By then, of course, the damage may be 
irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
The department will not give proper consideration to the moral and ethical 
issues involved unless forced to by a higher authority: the Board of Water and 
Power Commissioners, the City Council or the mayor. After all, the city is not 
Exxon or General Motors. It has a higher responsibility than just delivering a 
product at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the board, council or mayor forces the department to change course, it 
will divert all the water it can until one of two things happens: The courts 
make it stop or it is too late to prevent further environmental harm. Or both.

THE FAMILY IS CHANGING AND WE SHOULD ADMIT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS F. COLEMAN, Thomas F. Coleman, a Los Angeles attorney and adjunct 
professor at USC Law Center, filed a brief in the Braschi case on behalf of the 
Family Diversity Project and Family Service America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Public officials are beginning to see that diversity is the hallmark of 
contemporary family life in America, and the legal definition of "family" is 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
If two or more people function as a family, legislatures and courts are 
beginning to say, they are a family and should be treated legally as one, even 
if no blood tie or formal marriage exists. 
</P>
<P>
This concept was validated on July 6 in a New York court ruling that broadened 
the legal definition of "family" to include unmarried couples living together 
in long-term relationships. As a result, Miguel Braschi will not be evicted 
from the rent-controlled apartment that he shared for 10 years with his 
now-deceased domestic partner. 
</P>
<P>
The Braschi decision epitomizes American values at their best. It incorporates 
our legal tradition of flexibility in defining "family" and respects the 
pluralism of our culture. 
</P>
<P>
Much to the disappointment of some conservative political forces, the court 
refused to limit the definition of family to blood, marriage or adoption. The 
definition of family, the state Court of Appeals ruled, should "find its 
foundation in the reality of family life" rather than "fictitious legal 
distinctions or genetic history." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics called the decision a gay-rights case that created a sharp break 
with tradition. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
American law has a history of flexibility in defining family. As early as 1921, 
for example, the California Supreme Court granted worker's compensation 
survivor benefits to an unmarried woman, ruling that she and her deceased male 
partner had been a family. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three months ago in New York, the Court of Appeals declared 
unconstitutional a single-family zoning law prohibiting four unrelated elderly 
people from sharing the same residence, ruling that the four functioned as a 
family. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released last month, the California Legislature's Joint Select Task 
Force on the Changing Family recommended that families be identified by 
functions rather than structures. Locally, the Los Angeles City Task Force on 
Family Diversity called for the use of expanded definitions of "family" as new 
laws and regulations are adopted by city government. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles and San Francisco have passed "domestic partnership" ordinances, 
joining the ranks of West Hollywood, Berkeley and Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Municipalities in other states have made similar legal changes. In March, the 
Denver City Council repealed a zoning law that made it illegal for an unmarried 
couple to live in a jointly owned home in many residential areas. Late last 
year, the city of Madison, Wis., extended sick and bereavement leave to 
unmarried city employees living with a "family partner." 
</P>
<P>
Although same-sex couples are properly protected by these legal changes, the 
primary beneficiaries will be the millions of parents and children who live in 
foster families and step-families and the millions of unmarried heterosexual 
men and women who live together as domestic partners. 
</P>
<P>
Recent demographic studies show that only a small minority of American 
households fit the "Ozzie and Harriet" model of a breadwinner-husband and 
homemaker-wife raising young children. In fact, most people live in families 
with two working parents, a single parent, a step-parent. Or they live in 
foster families, extended families, domestic partnerships or one-person 
households. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding benefits in the name of "family diversity" makes some people uneasy. 
They cite morality and administrative convenience as reasons to maintain the 
status quo. 
</P>
<P>
But doesn't morality teach us that we should not discriminate against people 
just because they do not fit our stereotypes? We should not, however, confuse 
public morality with private morality. If government gets into the business of 
legislating a particular brand of private morality, then step-families, for 
example, might be punished because many religions do not allow divorce and 
remarriage. 
</P>
<P>
As for administrative convenience, the Braschi decision will consume some court 
time in determining whether two people are a "family" or merely roommates. 
However, this problem can be resolved by domestic partner laws that provide for 
a certificate authenticating the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, America would be better off if our leaders would accept what 
the public already knows. Family diversity has arrived and it's here to stay. 
The challenge we face is not how we can turn back the clock, but rather how we 
can forge solutions to our problems that do not pit one type of family against 
another.

people increasingly see themselves as discriminating consumers rather than 
disciplined producers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the country's political development has not kept pace with its economic and 
technical progress. Many of the voters felt provoked beyond endurance. On 
Sunday, they took it out on the LDP. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Socialist Party, led by a spirited ex-law professor, Takako Doi, 
thrashed the LDP, cutting the governing party's representation in the 
252-member Upper House of Parliament from 142 to 109. Only half the seats were 
at stake this time. The Socialists are now likely to use their strength, 
together with that of the smaller opposition parties, to force the government 
into an early general election that would allow them to seek more seats in the 
more powerful House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
What has driven the normally placid Japanese voters to this drastic state? A 
combination of factors are at work, compounded by the arrogance and complacency 
that the long years of unchallenged power have bred in the LDP. 
</P>
<P>
The new mood surfaced with the Recruit Co. scandal and the eventual resignation 
of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. When he was replaced by an apparently 
untainted (and relatively unknown) figure, Sosuke Uno, a lot of people still 
felt that the fat cats were getting off far too lightly. 
</P>
<P>
This simmering indignation over the Recruit scandal partly reflects unhappiness 
with the way in which the enormous wealth now sloshing around the country is 
being distributed. Japan has long been a society distinguished by a high degree 
of social and economic equality. Now skyrocketing land prices and the amazing 
boom in the stock market have made some people instant millionaires while many 
others are deprived of any prospect of ever owning a home. For most Japanese, 
daily life does not correspond in comfort or amenities to what one expects of 
one of the world's richest nations. 
</P>
<P>
As the Recruit affair unfolded, the LDP chose to ram through a new 3% sales 
tax. When it went into effect on April 1, it provoked a furious reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those most directly affected by the tax are women, particularly since 
all family budgeting is the traditional responsibility of housewives. And, 
increasingly, Japanese women are voting the way they want to, not just the way 
their husbands do. As luck would have it, stories of Uno's involvements with 
geishas and other women began to emerge shortly after he became prime minister. 
A number of women voters saw in him a symbol of the contempt for women's 
concerns that is shared by many of the ruling male elite. Doi, whose party 
fielded 11 women among its 46 successful candidates, skillfully exploited this 
mood without referring to Uno's escapades. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Socialists have problems of their own. Decades in the wilderness 
have left the party hopelessly split into rival factions divided on personality 
or dogma. The Socialists have become dependent on the support of affiliated 
trade unions, and their parliamentary leadership has for long been dominated by 
superannuated union leaders who long ago stopped thinking about new policies or 
the possibility of power, preferring the thrill of doctrinal hair-splitting. 
The party is still officially wedded to outworn doctrines on defense and 
foreign policy, and has yet to reconcile itself officially to Japan's security 
treaty with the United States or normal relations with South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
However, in Japan, even more than other places, nothing succeeds like success. 
Doi has shown skill in attracting new and vigorous life to the party, and big 
business has begun to talk to the Socialists since it looks as if they may 
begin to wield some influence. Some of Japan's elite bureaucrats, who nowadays 
have less chance of seeking a political career in an increasingly hereditary 
and seniority-ridden LDP, may start to eye the Socialist Party as a better 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
The political consequences of the election are hard to gauge. If the LDP can 
get its act together, it may be possible to stymie the Socialists' chances of 
forcing a general election, perhaps by making concessions to one of the smaller 
parties that hold the balance of power in the Upper House. Alternatively, the 
current wave of support for the Socialists may turn out to be a transient 
protest. The LDP might try to bolster its fortunes by soft-pedaling the 
economic and trade liberalization policies it has been following, many of them 
in response to urging by the United States and other trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, we might expect the Japan-U.S. relationship to get a bit 
bumpier, or at least franker. To judge by the nonchalance of the Tokyo stock 
exchange, nothing special has happened. For the time being, we must wait until 
the dust has settled and the Japanese people get used to the discovery they 
have made: That democratic politics can be interesting.

MORNING BRIEFING: DEAN OF THESE QUARTERBACKS PUT THE JOURNEY IN JOURNEYMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Babe Laufenberg has started a grand total of six games in the National Football 
League, but he is the most experienced of the new quarterbacks in the camp of 
the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
He is not a stranger, either. Last year, in an exhibition game, he threw three 
touchdown passes in leading the San Diego Chargers to a 24-21 victory over the 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Laufenberg, 29, has been cut eight times by four teams, and is not expected to 
beat out Cowboy rookies Troy Aikman and Steve Walsh. "I know anything can 
happen," he says, "because everything's happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, he was watching a Monday night game in a bar in a Mexican 
village when Washington Redskin quarterback Joe Theismann suffered that 
gruesome, career-ending broken leg. In no time, Laufenberg was on a plane to 
Washington, where he signed on as a reserve for the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Laufenberg, formerly of Crespi High School and Indiana University, has always 
been a man on the move. He originally went to Stanford but had second thoughts 
after his first look at another Cardinal newcomer, John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him throw 50-yard out passes and started looking for the door," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aiming to please: Chicago Cub reliever Mitch (Wild Thing) Williams, asked the 
craziest thing he has ever done, told the Chicago Sun-Times: "When I was 
little, my dad told me to get off the roof. So I dove off. He caught me." 
</P>
<P>
Add Williams: Asked if he had any distinguishing marks, he said: "I have a 
tattoo of Speedy Gonzalez on my right calf. My dad has one, and so do my 
brothers. Our family never has been accused of being all there." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: When Bob Horner of the Atlanta Braves equaled the major league 
record by hitting four home runs in a game, what was distinctive about his 
performance? 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth: At the start of the week, Pete Rose Jr., 19-year-old third 
baseman for the Erie Orioles of the New York-Penn League, was hitting .300 and 
was leading his team in hits, doubles and runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Legend grows: From Ed Hinton of the Atlanta Journal: "Hal Baird, the Auburn 
baseball coach, once was demonstrating a radar gun to kids at a Saturday open 
house. Bo Jackson, who loves children (and has now written and published a book 
for them) walked onto the diamond unannounced and unwarmed, and hurled three 
consecutive pitches clocked in excess of 90 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
Add Journal: Bud Shaw recalled a time the Cleveland Indians' team bus was going 
to Anaheim Stadium where the marquee read "Tonight, Nolan Ryan vs. the 
Cleveland Indians." According to Shaw, Oscar Gamble took one look and said, "A 
good night tonight is going 0 for 4 and not getting hit in the head." 
</P>
<P>
Add Ryan: From Oakland slugger Dave Parker: "When I was in Pittsburgh, Nolan 
was in Houston. I used a 37-inch, 37-ounce bat. The first time up, I tried to 
get his fastball and strained the ligaments in my left wrist on the first 
swing. On the second pitch, I checked my swing and strained ligaments in my 
right wrist. One at-bat against Nolan put me on the disabled list for 21 days." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Trivia answer: All four homers were hit with the bases empty, 
and Atlanta lost the game. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Golfer Lee Trevino, on winning: "I played the tour in 1967 and told 
jokes and nobody laughed. Then I won the U.S. Open the next year, told the same 
jokes and everybody laughed like hell."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

LANGSTON TRADE AGAIN PAYS DIVIDENDS FOR EXPOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Montreal Expos decided that Mark Langston was the pitcher they needed 
to contend in the National League East, they were willing to pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
They sent three promising pitchers to the Seattle Mariners for the 
hard-throwing left-hander. There has not been a moment that the Expos have 
regretted the move. 
</P>
<P>
While Randy Johnson, Brian Holman and Gene Harris have potential, Langston has 
pitched the Expos into first place. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night at Montreal, Langston struck out 10 and gave up only five hits in 
a 2-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who has three shutouts in his 12 starts for Montreal, improved to 8-3 
as an Expo. 
</P>
<P>
When Langston made his Montreal debut May 28, the Expos were in fourth place 
with a 23-24 record. They are 36-17 since he joined them and lead the division 
by 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
"He has given us even more than we hoped he would," Manager Buck Rodgers said. 
"He has given us a chance to win every game he's started. There are times when 
nobody pitches any better." 
</P>
<P>
Even in his three defeats, Langston pitched at least six innings. In eight of 
his other nine, he has not given up more than one earned run. In the other, he 
gave up three runs in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to get runs," Langston said, "but it's probably better for me if we 
don't score too many. In close games I tend to concentrate more and make more 
of my pitches count. When it's close, you have to have an idea of what you want 
every pitch to do before you throw it." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, St. Louis 2 -- The Cubs, who are becoming the Expos' chief 
challenger, ended Joe Magrane's six-game winning streak, at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Kilgus (6-9), who had not won since June 6, worked six innings and singled 
in a run. The Cub bullpen finished up for Kilgus. Mitch Williams pitched the 
last two innings, gave up a run and took over the league lead with his 25th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Oquendo of the Cardinals had two hits to extend his hitting streak to 23 
games, longest in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane (11-7) gave up six hits and three runs in seven innings. He struck out 
five. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 5, Atlanta 4 -- Robby Thompson hit a home run and the Giants won 
their second in a row at Atlanta, handing the Braves their sixth consecutive 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Mike LaCoss (5-6) worked seven innings and Craig Lefferts earned his 18th save. 
Ed Whited hit a two-run home run in the ninth for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, New York 2 -- Bobby Bonilla singled in the tie-breaking run in 
the eighth inning at New York, ending the Mets' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff King led off the ninth against loser Rick Aguilera (6-4) with his first 
major league home run. Bill Landrum worked the bottom of the ninth for his 14th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
Said Doug Drabek, who fell to 8-7: "I don't think I've ever won on my birthday 
before, except once in the minors. It was exciting to beat this club." 
</P>
<P>
The defeat dropped the Mets into third place, behind the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Met Manager Davey Johnson: "We know we're not going to win them all. 
There's still a lot of baseball left. We've played well. That's all I'm 
concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 6, Cincinnati 2 -- As the injuries continue to mount for the Reds, so 
do the the defeats. Eric Davis joined the long list of injured players and 
missed this game at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who had lost four in a row at home to the Cardinals last weekend, 
handed the Reds their ninth consecutive defeat and 13th in their last 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Whitson, enjoying his finest season, improved to 14-6. The victories match 
his career high in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Garry Templeton singled in two runs in the fourth and Shawn Abner hit a 
three-run home run in the seventh to back Whitson. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, the Reds put left-hander Danny Jackson on the disabled list 
because of a shoulder injury. Jackson, a 23-game winner last season, is 6-11 
and has an earned-run average of 5.60. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
HAWKINS BRINGS END TO YANKEE LOSING STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, the New York Yankees have resembled a revolving door. There 
seems to be a team coming, a team going and another on the field. 
</P>
<P>
But owner George Steinbrenner and other Yankee executives haven't given up on 
Andy Hawkins, the right-handed pitcher they signed as a free agent last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, who won 14 games with the San Diego Padres last season, was hit hard 
in his first two starts for the Yankees. In the first, he gave up nine runs and 
11 hits in 4 1/3 innings. In the second, he gave up six runs and nine hits in 4 
1/3 innings while the Yankees fell to 1-7. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night at Cleveland, the 29-year-old Hawkins pitched a five-hitter to 
beat Greg Swindell and the Indians, 5-1, as the Yankees ended a seven-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees knocked out Swindell (13-3) in the fourth inning. Swindell, who had 
won nine of his last 10 decisions, was largely responsible for the Indians' 
move in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Sax and Don Mattingly led the Yankee assault. Sax had four hits and stole 
three bases, and Mattingly hit his 13th home run and drove in two runs. Jesse 
Barfield homered for the final Yankee run. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven games is a long time," said Hawkins, who is 12-9. "I felt I had to pitch 
well tonight. It's not the most critical time of the year yet, but we needed to 
get started." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 9, Baltimore 3 -- Kirby Puckett, the major leagues' leading hitter, 
homered and drove in four runs at Minneapolis as the Orioles lost their sixth 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, the best fielding team in the majors, made two first-inning errors 
to help the Twins score twice. The Twins broke it open with four more in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Anderson (10-9) won for the first time in a month. He needed help in the 
seventh inning after giving up three runs in 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Puckett, who averaged 28 home runs the last three seasons, hit his seventh of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 10, Kansas City 0 -- Wade Boggs is sometimes referred to as a singles 
hitter. But, in this game at Boston, the perennial batting champion went for 
extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Boggs had four extra-base hits in a game. He had three 
doubles and a triple to lead a 16-hit attack. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Boddicker (9-7) breezed to his fifth consecutive victory and his second 
complete game. He gave up nine singles. 
</P>
<P>
"This game was just what the doctor ordered to put us on the move," said Boggs, 
who lifted his average to .330. "I hit the ball hard and it found the holes." 
</P>
<P>
George Brett returned to the Royals' lineup, but Bo Jackson, bothered by a 
bruised thigh, did not play. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 7, Milwaukee 2 -- Fred Lynn hit a three-run home run in the first 
inning at Milwaukee and it was just what the Tigers and pitcher Doyle Alexander 
needed to both end six-game losing streaks. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, the weakest hitting team in the league, batted around in the fifth, 
scoring four times to build a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander (5-10) gave up six hits and only one earned run in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 7, Seattle 6 -- Ozzie Guillen doubled to open the eighth inning at 
Chicago and eventually scored the winning run on a double play to give the 
White Sox their 10th win in 11 games since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
Donn Pall (3-1) gained the victory in relief. DAN HAFNER

Media Companies: Earnings are up for two media enterprises. Knight-Ridder Co.'s 
second-quarter earnings nearly tripled from a year earlier. The Miami-based 
company's net income amounted to $126.9 million, compared to $45 million a year 
ago. Revenue rose 12% to $578.7 million. The results include an after-tax 
$55.5-million gain on the sale of five television stations and a pretax gain of 
$49.1 million on the sale of the Pasadena Star-News. Washington Post Co. said 
its earnings rose 23% to $60.5 million in the second quarter. Revenue rose 8% 
to $374.5 million. The results reflect increased revenue at its newspaper 
division, Newsweek magazine, its television stations and cable division.

Brokerage Firms: The profit picture improved at two industry leaders. Salomon 
Inc.'s second-quarter profit more than tripled from the year-ago period to $253 
million -- a record. Revenue jumped 64% to $2.32 billion. The company said its 
strong earnings reflected "the industrywide improvement in volume in the U.S. 
bond and equity markets," as well as profits across most product lines. 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. reported a 41% jump in its second-quarter 
earnings to $55 million. Revenue rose 32% to $3.3 billion. Shearson, a 
subsidiary of American Express Co., attributed its performance to increased 
investor activity and cost cutting. Both firms are based in New York.

One Singular Sensation . . . and Counting: Producer Joseph Papp took the stage 
at the Shubert Theatre on Broadway Monday night to lead the audience in singing 
"Happy Birthday" to "A Chorus Line." The long-running hit show about dancers 
auditioning for a musical was closing out its 14th year and moving into its 
15th. "A Chorus Line" opened on Broadway July 25, 1975. ALEENE MacMINN

Police in London are investigating the reported theft of a $1.9-million Paul 
Gauguin watercolor from a cargo hangar at London's Heathrow Airport. The 
9x4-inch watercolor, "Tahitienne En Pareo Rouge" (Tahitian woman in a red 
pareu), was being shipped from Beadlestone William Inc. in New York to the 
gallery's London subsidiary. The 100-year-old watercolor is the only painting 
missing from a consignment of four works. ALEENE MacMINN

Fox Broadcasting's hot summer ratings continued Sunday as the fledgling network 
beat ABC, CBS and NBC in head-to-head competition from 8 to 9 p.m. for the 
first time in its three-year history. On the A. C. Nielsen chart released 
Tuesday, the Fox tandem of "America's Most Wanted" and "Totally Hidden Video" 
placed 29th and 31st, respectively, with "Most Wanted" reaching 22 percent of 
the viewing audience, a record for Fox. One reason for Fox's success was the 
absence of CBS' "Murder, She Wrote," a Top 10 show that was preempted by an 
episode of the Lee Horsley Western "Paradise." The full ratings list is on Page 
9. 
</P>
<P>
*There was more good news for Fox as its Saturday night series earned its 
highest share to date. Moving to Portland from Broward County, Fla., the 
second-season debut fared better than several network shows, including the last 
four installments of the CBS' comedy "Fresno."

KCBS-TV Channel 2 news director Erik Sorenson has been moved up to the newly 
created position of vice president and station manager. Sorenson, who has been 
the station's news boss for most of the last five years, will be involved in 
the administration of all station activity. Channel 2, which despite numerous 
anchor and format changes has been running third in the news ratings race 
throughout most of Sorenson's tenure, has not yet named a replacement to head 
the news department.ALEENE MacMINN

WEISS DUO CLOSES CHAMBER SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imaginative programming is seldom the hallmark of summer concerts, particularly 
outdoors. It has been at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, however, where the 
Weiss Duo Monday gave the third and final concert of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic-sponsored chamber music series. 
</P>
<P>
Walton's 1950 Sonata is a quirky, two-movement vehicle for heated abstraction. 
It makes vague points with passionate relish, in a sort of rhetorically 
impressionistic style. 
</P>
<P>
Violinist Sidney and pianist Jeanne Weiss supported Walton's diffuse music with 
considerable eloquence, particularly in the more introspective variations of 
the second movement. They have recorded the piece and bring obvious affection 
and well-practiced team-work to the work. But the results proved stubbornly 
underwhelming Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez's 1924 Sonatina is much more articulate, and provided the duo with fully 
realized opportunity for direct, serious communication. The Philharmonic 
concertmaster brought interpretive nobility and technical flamboyance to the 
task. 
</P>
<P>
For all the violinist's strength in urgent sentiments and virtuoso flourishes, 
it was the Andante cantabile movement that succeeded best in the Opus 18 Sonata 
by a young Richard Strauss. There the Weisses combined in quiet instrumental 
song of pointed, unexaggerated charm and sophisticated color. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart's comparatively innocent Sonata in C, K. 296, received lithe, blithe, 
eminently stylish playing from Jeanne Weiss. Her husband's effort sounded 
rather square, however -- sturdy, but truly comfortable only in the sweetly 
poignant middle movement. 
</P>
<P>
Elegant lyricism was the Weisses' strength, as they proved again in their 
Rachmaninoff encore, "Daisies."JOHN HENKEN

'HALFTIME': LIVES OF FIVE YALE MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Halftime: Five Yale Men at Midlife" (Channels 15 and 24 tonight at 10, Channel 
28 Friday at 9 p.m.) is for voyeurs more than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
We look in on the mid-life crises of five graduates of Yale University, Class 
of 1963. The five were selected after hundreds of questionnaires were sent to 
members of the class by Yale psychology professor Daniel J. Levinson, author of 
"The Seasons of a Man's Life." 
</P>
<P>
First we see the men at their homes, then in interviews conducted by Levinson 
at Yale, and finally in a group, at a sensitive guys' bull session moderated by 
Levinson. 
</P>
<P>
It's about as deep -- and about as entertaining -- as an average episode of 
"Donahue." 
</P>
<P>
One of the five, television executive/author Steve Sohmer, is from Los Angeles. 
We see him riding in his chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce, stretching by his pool, 
and wining and dining a lady friend at a table ostentatiously lit by 18 
candles. 
</P>
<P>
In the show's most gripping moment, we observe Sohmer chomping furiously on his 
cigar as one of the other men explains what it was like to leave his wife for 
another man. We also hear Sohmer supposedly spilling his guts about his two 
failed marriages. 
</P>
<P>
That's "supposedly" because with Sohmer, as with each of the five, major 
questions go unanswered. This isn't surprising, as the show purports to cover 
the inner lives of five men in a mere 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the group session, Levinson chides his subjects for not 
responding more directly to each other's remarks. While it's true that the men 
refrain from passing any negative judgment on each other, this behavior is 
predictable, given the format. 
</P>
<P>
Director David Sutherland has made "Halftime" easy to watch. It's also pop 
psychology at its most ersatz.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: READERS HAVE THEIR SAY ON ABORTION DOCUMENTARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We get letters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Today's bundle concerns Thursday's column ("Ted Turner Has His Say With 
'Abortion: For Survival' ") on a program advocating, without opposition, the 
pro-choice position in the abortion debate. 
</P>
<P>
The program ran on Turner's cable superstation TBS, followed by a chaotic panel 
discussion featuring two representatives from each side of the abortion issue. 
The panel discussion was punctuated by taped pro-choice promos and marked by 
moderator Martin Agronsky's utter helplessness in controlling the participants. 
</P>
<P>
The letters: 
</P>
<P>
I am especially upset over your assertion that anti-choice people have an 
obligation to impose their views on the rest of society "if they truly believe, 
rightly or wrongly, that abortion is murder." 
</P>
<P>
The belief that abortion is murder is held almost entirely by people who base 
this on a religious ground. I'm not trying to dismiss these people because of 
this, but if you look at the issue with logic and some scientific 
understanding, it's apparent that we are dealing with something in the process 
of becoming a person, not something that is yet an individual life. 
</P>
<P>
It is also important to remember that church and state in this country are 
supposedly separate. If you believe that abortion is morally wrong, that is 
your perfect right. But if you don't believe in the right of each woman to 
decide for themselves, you believe in compulsory pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
You ask me to be angry that the pro-choice voice is given such wide exposure. I 
find that absurd when the anti-choice forces are the most powerful and heavily 
funded organization around, and their side is being forced on me by the 
governor, the President and the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
CLAIRE MARSH, 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Does the pro-choice factor get an opportunity to present its side whenever the 
Pope or the President or other so-called leaders give their views about 
abortion? Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it is only a whisper and a short span of time in TV when Ted Turner runs 
"Abortion: For Survival." Obviously you never can and never will understand the 
horrors of unwanted births and unwanted children -- all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Hooray for Ted Turner. He is to be congratulated. You are not. 
</P>
<P>
ANNABEL WILSON, 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
You are just another one of the many conservatives working for the Los Angeles 
Times, spreading anti-choice propaganda, and likely you are one of the many 
white males who feel threatened that women are taking back their own 
reproductive rights and power. 
</P>
<P>
Let me ask you this: Are you willing and able to house the homeless and abused 
children of this world that are living right now? Is our society ready to hold 
men responsible for the child rearing in this country? Should we have also the 
right to legislate men's bodies? How about mandatory castration for all men who 
rape? 
</P>
<P>
I say hooey to you and The Times. 
</P>
<P>
DEBRA L. DEWEESE, 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I love the question you started your article with: "Is it really true that 
abortion opponents dislike children and sex?" It is nothing less than ludicrous 
for anyone, especially from the pro-death people who make a very profitable 
business of killing the unborn child, to even hint that the pro-life are 
against children. That is as ridiculous as saying Jews are against kosher food. 
</P>
<P>
HARRY H. WILSON, 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I really don't see why the anti-abortionists are demanding equal time, or why 
Ted Turner should even consider offering them any time on "his" network. After 
all, I don't see Paul Crouch or Pat Robertson offering any equal time for 
opposing viewpoints on their respective networks, the Trinity Broadcasting 
Network and the Christian Broadcasting Network. 
</P>
<P>
LESLIE TYNDALL, 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The next time Operation Rescue is in town, sir, please go to their warm-up 
rally, usually the night before their Saturday actions to close clinics. I did 
this past June. 
</P>
<P>
For three hours, I listened to speaker after speaker literally demonize any and 
all of the citizens who disagree with their position. I also listened to their 
calls for the imposition of a theocracy in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Where are the moderates? And where will our Bill of Rights go if these people 
are successful? They do not believe in our Constitution, nor in separation of 
church and state. 
</P>
<P>
So I question, sir, your tacit support for true believers, while engaging in 
the rhetoric of neutrality and using the cover of the journalists' middle 
ground. The sad fact is that the pro-choice people, Ted Turner et al., are the 
middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
JAMES LASPINA, 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner calling anti-abortionists "bozos" just doesn't go far enough. 
Ignorant bozos would have been much better. 
</P>
<P>
ANTHONY DEROSE, 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who are unable to accept the extremes on either side of the issue 
seem to be a very small minority. I would like to know, though, how you tell 
the difference between "excellent propaganda ('Abortion: For Survival')" and 
"outrageously slanted propaganda ('The Silent Scream')." 
</P>
<P>
Does the difference depend on your viewpoint?

The first jointly published American-Soviet campus magazine, to be called 
Montage, is expected to make its debut early next year, a Stanford University 
organizer of the project said. "It's an idea whose time has come," said Susan 
McKean, 20, an editor at the Stanford Daily who next month will fly to Moscow 
for the quarterly magazine's first editorial meeting with organizers at Moscow 
State University. The brainchild of McKean and Scott Talcott, 21, a student at 
Pepperdine University, the magazine will be published out of a rented office at 
Stanford, with a first run of 40,000 copies to be mailed to campuses and 
bookstores across both nations.

NEW CHINA STUDENT PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first known revival of student protests in China since the army crushed 
a movement for democracy last month, about 300 Beijing University students 
gathered in a campus courtyard and mockingly sang Communist songs, students 
reported. The demonstrators said they were upset because work units have 
rejected some graduating seniors for jobs, citing their pro-democracy 
sentiments. The small but daring demonstration was held despite thousands of 
arrests from earlier protests and strict martial-law rules against such 
gatherings. Local Communist Party officials branded the rally "a serious 
political transgression," and campus authorities were interrogating students in 
an attempt to identify the leaders, Chinese sources reported.

The environmental group Greenpeace said a recent federal study found tiny 
amounts of highly toxic dioxin in virtually all U.S.-produced pulp used to make 
bleached paper products such as coffee filters and diapers. Paper industry 
officials contend the dioxin levels found in paper products are so low they 
pose no threat to consumers. But an Environmental Protection Agency official 
said the long-term health risks remain unclear. The study, conducted by the EPA 
and the paper industry, surveyed all U.S. paper mills that use a chlorine-based 
bleaching process to convert brown pulp to white. Dioxins and other toxic 
compounds are formed as a byproduct of that bleaching process. Shelley Stewart, 
a spokeswoman for Greenpeace, said the study found that 103 of the 104 mills 
had detectable levels of dioxin in their pulp.

David (Moochie) Welch was sentenced to death for the December, 1986, slayings 
of six people, including two children, in an east Oakland home. Alameda County 
Superior Court Judge Stanley Golde chose to follow the jury's recommendation of 
death. "There is no circumstance which extenuates the gravity of this crime," 
said Golde in issuing the sentence. He added, "His entire life is a life of 
violence." Welch, 31, was convicted on June 19 of six counts of murder stemming 
from the bloody, predawn shooting rampage that left his former girlfriend and 
five others dead. Welch had a long-running feud with the woman's family. Golde 
cited Welch's criminal history, which includes rape, sodomy, assault with a 
deadly weapon and assault and battery on various guards and jailers during 
previous jailings.

JAZZ NOTES : GRANT TO GEORGE RUSSELL WELL DESERVED; SUMMER CRUISES GET READY TO 
HIT THE WAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Russell has been the jazz composers' jazz composer for nearly four 
decades. Like Fletcher Henderson before him, he has been held in high esteem by 
his contemporaries, despite the failure of the larger jazz audience to 
acknowledge his skills fully. 
</P>
<P>
It was particularly gratifying, therefore, when it was announced last week that 
Russell had received a $375,000 award, spread over a five-year period, from the 
John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old Russell, who has been teaching at the New England Conservatory 
of Music for the last 20 years, is currently in Paris, rehearsing a 15-piece 
band for a summer European tour, his fourth in the last four years. Reached by 
telephone earlier this week, he described his reactions to the award in 
typically controlled language. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly floored me when I heard about it," Russell said. "But I'm doing 
fine now. Everything happens in its proper time, and my first reaction was that 
it had come at exactly the right time -- economically, of course, but also at 
the right age for me. I'm at the stage now where I think I can handle a 
windfall of this size. There was a time when it might have been overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"The Norwegians have an expression that goes: 'It takes a strong back to carry 
a good day.' I hate to equate good days with money, because that's not 
necessarily true. But the MacArthur grant is certainly going to enable me to 
make some of the goals that I wanted to get." 
</P>
<P>
At the top of Russell's want list is the completion of his second book, "The 
Science of Tonal Gravity." Two-thirds along the way, it will be an expansion of 
his "Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization" -- the first, and still 
the best and most practical, approach to the art of improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
"Finishing the book has always been top priority," he said. "I've been focusing 
on it for a long time, even when I didn't have time off to think about it. But 
that's just as well. Too much time off would unfocus me. I seem to work better 
under deadlines. If I get time off, I get lazy. Hopefully the award will allow 
me to find the right balance of time to complete the book." 
</P>
<P>
Russell saw no possibility that the award would have a significant effect upon 
his compositions. The complex multi-rhythms and disjunct melodies of his early 
work -- so influential in the '60s on musicians as diverse as Art Farmer, John 
Coltrane, Eric Dolphy and Don Ellis -- have evolved over the years into a 
mature music that almost defies categorization. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll continue doing what I've been doing," he said. "My present work tries to 
achieve a kind of world view or synthesis of many kinds of musics, one that 
doesn't ignore the sounds of our time. My hope is that it's a complete music -- 
physical, emotional as well as thought-provoking." 
</P>
<P>
DIG OUT THE DRAMAMINE: Two upcoming jazz cruises are beginning to take bookings 
for their necessarily limited space. 
</P>
<P>
The first -- on NCL's Southward -- embarks from Los Angeles on Aug. 28 for a 
four-day trip to the south, with stops in Catalina, San Diego and Ensenada. The 
stellar jazz contingent on board includes Lorez Alexandria, Bill Henderson, 
Harry (Sweets) Edison, Jack Sheldon, Red Holloway, Plas Johnson, Art Hillary 
and others. Chuck Niles of KKGO and Bob Parlocha of KJAZ will emcee the 
performances. Information: (213) 471-1710. 
</P>
<P>
The second cruise takes place on the Regent Sun, departing from Vancouver, 
Canada, on Sept. 17 and arriving in Los Angeles four days later.

PRO-CHOICE: L.A. TAKING CENTER STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Supreme Court decided early this month to uphold a Missouri law 
restricting abortion, and implicitly invited other states to enact abortion 
curbs, it sent pro-choice and anti-abortion groups scrambling to raise money, 
recruit volunteers and plan strategy for the coming showdowns in state capitols 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
How the two sides are doing so highlights some fundamental differences between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
For anti-abortion groups, this mostly means drawing once again from a durable 
network of volunteers and small contributors around the country, many of them 
based in churches or allied with conservative political figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maturing Process 
</P>
<P>
On the pro-choice side, meanwhile, it is a time of rapid change. After years on 
the defensive against a larger, better-organized adversary, the cause is 
clearly evolving into a well-funded movement based in the nation's traditional 
urban liberal bastions. And Los Angeles, with its wealth and its unique ability 
to package and sell a message, is emerging in many respects as the movement's 
most important center of power. 
</P>
<P>
As they mobilize for the war over abortion rights, national pro-choice groups 
look to Los Angeles not just for money and members, but also for celebrities 
and direction. 
</P>
<P>
Westside liberals provide an outsize share of the movement's membership and 
financial support. Hollywood lends big names for national fund-raising and 
political efforts. And elected officials and consultants in the city's 
Waxman-Berman Democratic organization help direct the movement's political 
strategy from the local to the national level. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is a source of support for the whole national campaign, for the 
whole 50 states," said Kate Michelman, executive director of the National 
Abortion Rights Action League in Washington. "California -- and Los Angeles in 
particular -- is a very important source of members and a very important source 
of fairly high dollar donors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's Role 
</P>
<P>
But even more significant, Michelman says, is the role played by the Hollywood 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
Her organization has prominently featured entertainers in its advertising and 
fund-raising appeals. And Hollywood celebrities were in the front lines of the 
huge pro-choice march on Washington in April. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood and Los Angeles are critical. These stars represent role models for 
people. They can reach an audience we can't reach," Michelman said. "They are 
vehicles for us to get our message out, to educate people, to help us really 
deepen our ability to spread the word. They are a very important resource." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion activists readily acknowledge that participation by entertainers 
in the fight is overwhelmingly on the pro-choice side, and they are looking for 
ways to neutralize this advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest influence we (in Los Angeles) have on the rest of this country is 
through the movie industry and TV," said Susan Carpenter McMillan, president of 
the Right to Life League of Southern California. "So far in the movie industry 
it's been one-sided." 
</P>
<P>
To counter a perceived pro-choice bias in Hollywood, anti-abortion forces have 
been pressuring advertisers to boycott television and radio programs they see 
as having an "anti-life" message. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the National Right to Life Committee criticized as "prime-time, 
pro-abortion propaganda" a two-hour NBC television drama about the landmark 
1973 Roe vs. Wade abortion case. The network was forced to reduce the price of 
commercials for the program. 
</P>
<P>
In June, ABC radio aired an hourlong discussion on abortion, hosted by Barbara 
Walters, with no sponsors. ABC officials said advertisers were "scared to 
death" of the topic. 
</P>
<P>
David O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee in 
Washington, said advertisers should take a long look before buying commercials 
on programs with a pro-choice slant. "A lot of people might tune in to that 
show, be offended, and be less inclined to buy their products." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Outrageous 
</P>
<P>
Marge Tabankin, executive director of the Hollywood Women's Political 
Committee, called the efforts to pressure advertisers with threats of boycotts 
outrageous and a form of blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
Tabankin's group was one of the principal organizers of the march that drew 
300,000 pro-choice demonstrators to the nation's capital in April. The 
demonstration was one of Washington's largest ever, eclipsing civil rights and 
Vietnam-era marches and giving some pro-choice strategists hope that the issue 
was becoming the unifying cause that liberals have lacked for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to abortion, the entertainment industry has "a fairly unified 
position on a question that seems to be clearly dividing the country," Tabankin 
said. "People are involved in this issue as activists. It is not just a 
fund-raising base." 
</P>
<P>
The stars were out in force that spring day. Jane Fonda, Morgan Fairchild, 
Whoopi Goldberg, Veronica Hamel, Polly Bergen, Anne Archer, Cybill Shepherd, 
Donna Mills, Michele Lee. 
</P>
<P>
The night before the march, a star-studded cast performed before an overflow 
crowd at a Washington fund-raiser billed as a "Celebration of Personal 
Freedom." 
</P>
<P>
On stage were Fonda, Judy Collins, Melissa Manchester, Susan Sarandon, Glenn 
Close, Leonard Nimoy, Jill Eikenberry, Michael Tucker, Linda Ellerbee, Marlo 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's Missouri decision, Tabankin said, 
thought is being given to using Hollywood's creative powers to develop a 
pro-choice message for television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Communication Skills 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we do very well in this town is communicate to the world," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
And as the battle over abortion rights shifts to the states, Tabankin said, 
Hollywood figures will be there to help out pro-choice candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are sitting in a swing district in Illinois or an Assembly seat in 
Florida and a respected celebrity makes an appearance with a candidate or a 
pro-choice group, it's going to get more coverage than if they were not there," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Celebrity names help to get the grass roots to respond," said Robin Schneider, 
executive director of the California Abortions Rights Action League. "Their 
names definitely add a certain glitz to our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion forces say Los Angeles' influence in the national pro-choice 
movement stems in part from the city's liberal Democratic political 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"The Waxman-Berman machine is unalloyed in its advocacy of abortion," said 
Brian Johnston, regional director of the National Right to Life Committee in 
Sacramento. "They are a force to be reckoned with." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said a "willingness to support a pro-choice 
position" on abortion is "very high on the agenda" when he considers supporting 
candidates for office. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman's clout extends far beyond his Hollywood-Fairfax district. His ability 
to help liberal candidates tap large sources of campaign contributions, 
combined with his own campaign resources, extends his reach statewide and 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry may be more powerful in Washington than he is in Los Angeles," said Rep. 
Robert Matsui (D-Sacramento). "He has a great deal of influence over Democratic 
members of the House." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, for example, is helping to raise funds in Los Angeles and elsewhere for 
Rep. James J. Florio (D-N.J.), the pro-choice Democratic nominee for governor 
of New Jersey. The November election there is considered an early test of the 
power of the pro-choice movement at the polls in the wake of the Supreme 
Court's decision in the Missouri case. 
</P>
<P>
Enhancing Waxman's reach, particularly in California, are the campaign 
techniques and targeted Democratic slate mailers developed by political 
consultants Carl D'Agostino and Michael Berman, brother of Rep. Howard L. 
Berman (D-Panorama City). These resources are made available to candidates whom 
the Los Angeles organization supports. Michael Berman also is respected and 
feared as one of the state's leading tacticians on redistricting, an issue very 
much on the minds of politicians as the 1990 Census approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman said the entire Democratic congressional delegation from California is 
pro-choice. "It reflects the Democratic voter in California," he said. "It 
reflects popular sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
The veteran lawmaker said he personally feels "quite strongly that the issue of 
abortion ought to be left to the choice of the woman involved. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Supreme Court has come down with a decision that will open up the 
whole issue to politics and not leave it as a constitutional right that cannot 
be infringed upon," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Feelings 
</P>
<P>
"Many people in Los Angeles, not just in the entertainment industry, feel 
strongly about this matter and will want to contribute to win the battle we are 
now forced to face." 
</P>
<P>
Just as pro-choice political candidates look to Los Angeles for financial 
support, so do the pro-choice organizations and their allies -- Planned 
Parenthood, the National Abortion Rights Action League, the National 
Organization for Women, National Women's Political Caucus, the American Civil 
Liberties Union, and others. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very generous people in L.A," said Michelman of the National 
Abortion Rights Action League. She estimated that 25,000 of the organization's 
300,000 national members live in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Michelman said the money that is raised here will "impact on almost every state 
in some way" and will finance early battles against anti-abortion forces in 
Louisiana, Florida and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"Money gives us the power to be more active," said Dr. Joan Babbott, executive 
director of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As legal challenges to the Roe vs. Wade decision have mounted, Babbott said, 
Planned Parenthood and other pro-choice groups have seen a surge in 
contributions -- even before the Supreme Court's Missouri decision. "There is a 
profound fight going on. It is going to go on state by state," she said. "We've 
got a real . . . war on our hands." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Planned Parenthood affiliate raised $300,000 more than its 
$1.4-million fund-raising goal in the fiscal year that ended in January. 
</P>
<P>
At the national level, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America expects to 
raise $17 million to $18 million this year, according to Peter Wilderotter, 
vice president of resources. That is up from $14 million in 1987. "We 
anticipate that people are going to come forward and be counted," Wilderotter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice leaders say the adversity of the recent Supreme Court decision has 
made fund-raising easier. "It's very difficult to organize around the status 
quo," Wilderotter said. 
</P>
<P>
The national organization now has about 350,000 members, with California 
supplying about 14% of the total. "California represents a major portion of our 
donor base," said Wilderotter. "What happens in Los Angeles certainly has a 
tremendous effect on what we do nationally." 
</P>
<P>
The California Abortion Rights Action League also has seen a sharp jump in 
membership and contributions this year. The organization's Southern California 
branch has seen its membership grow from 6,000 to 8,000 so far this year. Many 
have been drawn by the prominent role the Santa Monica-based league has played 
in countering the Operation Rescue anti-abortion demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
In just the last three months, the organization has raised $180,000, compared 
to $200,000 in all of the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of our resources come from the Westside," said executive director 
Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
McMillan, the Right to Life League of Southern California president, agrees 
that pro-choice forces are more successful at raising money, particularly in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to compare when it comes to the dollars," McMillan said. She 
described anti-abortion forces as "a miniature David" competing with "an 
incredibly large Goliath when it comes to money." 
</P>
<P>
But McMillan and other anti-abortion leaders say the movement's strength is in 
its numbers. The National Right to Life Committee has 300,000 donors 
nationally, but claims several million members through its network of local and 
state chapters. 
</P>
<P>
"We could triple our funding and still be out-funded by the pro-abortion side," 
said O'Steen, executive director of the committee. "What we have is a 
grass-roots network that they have never been able to duplicate."

OPINIONS CLASH ON METRO RAIL COST OVERRUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bracing for release of an extraordinary audit of the Los Angeles Metro Rail 
project, contractors and transit officials building the city's first subway 
system have begun to blame one another for lengthy delays and other 
construction difficulties that already have run the massive undertaking 
millions of dollars over-budget. 
</P>
<P>
Contractors contend that the Southern California Rapid Transit District has 
wrapped so much red tape around the $1.2-billion, 4.4-mile first phase of the 
subway project that it is almost impossible to get a decision on even the 
simplest problem. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials defend their Metro Rail performance, and they say contractors 
are complaining only because the RTD has adopted a vigorous approach toward 
cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
An audit to be released today is expected to side in large part with the 
contractors, revealing major management and contract supervision problems 
inside the transit district, The Times has learned. The first phase of the 
$3.7-billion Metro Rail subway project is now 18 months behind schedule and 
believed to be substantially over budget. 
</P>
<P>
"If the same problems happen (in the second phase of construction)," a source 
familiar with the audit said, "we are talking about a dynamite situation . . . 
an unacceptable situation." 
</P>
<P>
The second phase, which will cost an estimated $2.5 billion, will extend the 
Metro Rail Red Line from downtown to North Hollywood, a distance of about 12 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro Rail project is one of the most costly subway jobs ever attempted, 
and one of the most complex. The 16-mile line -- funded by federal, state and 
local money -- will be owned by the commission and run by the RTD. 
</P>
<P>
Three separate audits of the project currently are under way -- one by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation, another by the RTD and the third by the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Friction exists between the commission and the transit district, which designed 
and is building the first 4.4 miles. Legally, both agencies can design and 
build transit rail lines and both are fully staffed to do that work. The result 
is a certain amount of rivalry and duplication of effort. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to this friction are questions being raised by the Los Angeles City 
Council before it puts up the city's $96-million share of the second phase of 
Metro Rail and agrees to shoulder up to $181 million in cost overruns. The 
council wants to know more about the existing cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
Contractors have filed hundreds of claims, saying the district is stalling or 
refusing to pay for $51 million worth of work. The district denies the money is 
owed. 
</P>
<P>
Top RTD officials said that if the contractors have money problems, it is 
because they bid their jobs low and are now trying to run up the costs by 
claiming more money than they have coming. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to be firm with the contractors . . . to make sure we only pay for 
what we've contracted," said RTD Assistant General Manager William Rhine. "I 
can't find anything we are or are not doing that would result in this apparent 
degree of friction." 
</P>
<P>
With its release today, the commission's audit will be the first to be made 
public. It was ordered earlier this year in an attempt to get the lagging 
project back on schedule and stem the fiscal hemorrhage. As the Metro Rail 
funding authority, the commission oversees the project's progress and monitors 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
The audit was undertaken by one of the so-called "big eight" accounting firms, 
Deloitte, Haskins and Sells, in conjunction with the Kellogg Co., a management 
consulting firm. Prior to its release, it was sent for review to a panel of 
experts, including some from the transit district, which has attached its own 
evaluation of the audit and recommendations. The organization of what 
essentially is an outside audit of the audit itself was seen as evidence of the 
controversial nature of the report. 
</P>
<P>
The major fear among top commission officials is that cost overruns on the 
troubled first phase will drain millions of dollars needed to complete the 
remaining two-thirds of the Metro Rail project and construct an additional 
system of three light rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
The district has acknowledged that its contingency fund has withered from $131 
million down to $22 million. This fund -- part of the first-phase budget -- is 
used to cover unforeseen expenses. But district officials remain upbeat in 
their public assessments of the ambitious effort to bring Los Angeles its first 
subway system. 
</P>
<P>
"This job is going exceedingly well," project engineer Jim Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
One contractor told The Times, however, that his projects are millions of 
dollars over budget and more than a year behind schedule primarily because the 
RTD's plans for tunneling under high-rise buildings downtown were flawed. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Shank, managing partner in the Shank-Ohbayashi consortium that is boring 
tunnels on either side of the 7th Street Station at a contracted cost of $44 
million, said he shut down one of the firm's two jobs for six months, telling 
district officials that he wouldn't "mine under buildings with a defective 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
According to Shank, the Metro Rail financial and management problems are widely 
known throughout the construction industry and will have an impact on the 
second phase of bidding. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in the industry knows what is going on here in Los Angeles," Shank 
said. "It will have to push up the next round of bidding at least 25% to 30%. I 
wouldn't bid into Phase 2 at any price under the present . . . setup. It's a 
nightmare . . . unlike anything I've ever seen in 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
No tunnel work ever goes smoothly, Shank said, explaining that there are always 
problems and the unexpected is routine. Because of this, he added, "you're 
counting on the owner working with you to solve the problems" but "this owner 
doesn't . . . cooperate in any way." 
</P>
<P>
The transit district's staff rigidly enforces the contract specifications, even 
when those specifications are out of date or just won't work, Shank contended. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Shank pointed to the $18.8-million construction of twin tunnels 
between the Metro Rail stations at 5th and Hill streets and 7th and Flower 
streets. The job burrows under several tall buildings. 
</P>
<P>
To protect those buildings from settling while crews were tunneling, the 
district wrote rigid specifications into the plans, including dictating the use 
of a tunneling technique called "compaction grouting" to hold the earth in 
place while concrete liners are formed and braced. 
</P>
<P>
When his crews began boring, Shank said, they immediately ran into trouble. The 
tunnels passed through fine sand that ran like dry sugar and kept sloughing 
down around the machines, making tunneling the district's way virtually 
impossible. Shank said he worried that the ground would settle more than the 
one-eighth inch allowed in the district plans. 
</P>
<P>
"After we had started the job, we heard from another source that what (the 
district's) consultant had actually told them was that this compaction grouting 
wasn't going to work," Shank said. 
</P>
<P>
The district claimed it was not required to reveal this information and ordered 
him back to work, Shank said. 
</P>
<P>
Shank disagreed and rather than risk damaging the buildings overhead, he asked 
that a more expensive method called "chemical grouting" be used to firm up the 
sandy soils before the tunnels were dug. When the district refused, Shank shut 
the job down. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the district agreed to allow chemical grouting in the sugar-sands 
and it relaxed the safety tolerance eightfold, allowing up to one inch of soil 
settlement. Work was completed on the first of the parallel tunnels at an 
additional cost of $800,000 and the district paid the cost increase. 
</P>
<P>
District engineer Crowley said the original design was sound and explained that 
the district agreed to the changes to satisfy the concerns of Los Angeles city 
engineers, who sided with Shank, asking that the chemical grouting method be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get him back to work," Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
There are other signs of growing unrest among the contractors, including a 
lawsuit that was filed recently in Los Angeles Superior Court by Illinois Walsh 
Construction Co., builder of the Metro Rail maintenance shops and rail yards. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks $4.9 million in disputed work claims, including for the 
excavation of large pits in the shop floor. These pits were dug once, then had 
to be filled back up so other work could progress, then were re-dug in a 
$2.6-million earth-moving mix-up that the company said had resulted from 
district-caused delays. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Walsh officials would not comment on the case, nor would the district. 
However, Webster G. Wiley, the subcontractor who twice excavated the pits, said 
those delays and the extra work ran his part of the contract up from $184,899 
to $869,457, money that he and the general contractor are trying to collect. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the worst job that I've ever been on," Wiley sighed. 
</P>
<P>
Another complaint was that the district's plans and specifications were written 
seven or eight years ago and called for manufactured electrical or mechanical 
gear that had been off the market for years. One project manager for a big job 
said that when he tried to substitute equipment available today, the district's 
project managers would reject the replacement and "demand that the 
specifications be met 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Oftentimes, this meant custom-building a part, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You bid those jobs on the (specifications), true, but you expect that you can 
buy the item, the manager said, asking not to be identified. "No one estimates 
custom-building the whole damn job." 
</P>
<P>
He tried but failed to get someone higher up to override those rigid 
replacement demands, he said, then added, "We could never get to the decision 
makers . . . so we lost time and a lot of money."

PORT REJECTS KING'S NAME ON S.D. CENTER 
</P>

SAN DIEGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-month effort to rename the city's bayfront convention center for the Rev. 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ended Tuesday when the San Diego Unified Port 
District commissioners rejected the City Council's request to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In an anti-climactic, 4-3 decision, Commissioners Daniel Larsen, Raymond Burk, 
Milford Portwood and Robert Penner voted to support Burk's motion to retain the 
name San Diego Convention Center, established in a 1985 contract between the 
city and the Port District. Commissioners Louis Wolfsheimer, William Rick and 
Delton Reopelle, who supported the council-backed name of San Diego Martin 
Luther King Convention Center, voted against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was the second repudiation of a San Diego tribute to the slain 
civil rights leader in less than two years. In a referendum in November, 1987, 
voters reversed a council decision to rename Market Street as Martin Luther 
King Jr. Way, reinstating the downtown thoroughfare's original name. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the drive to honor King vowed to pursue the racially and politically 
sensitive issue, which has divided the city and dogged public officials since 
the City Council's decision in April, 1986, to rename Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search Is Not Over 
</P>
<P>
Wes Pratt, the lone black on the council and a leader of the King tribute 
effort, said the city still must find a suitable memorial to King and promised 
to press for renewed council action. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego has to come to grips with its ethnic diversity at some point in 
time," Pratt said after the commissioners' vote, held at a special meeting in 
the Holiday Inn Embarcadero ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
But a weary-sounding Mayor Maureen O'Connor said it was too soon to decide 
whether to place the issue before the council again. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I'm not prepared to say which way we'd go," O'Connor said in an 
interview. "I mean, really, we've tried this every which way, and we seem to be 
running into a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, it appears to be difficult to find a solution that would 
satisfy a majority," O'Connor added. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Stevens, who has led an unsuccessful boycott of the convention 
center since the port commissioners dodged the name issue in February, will 
hold a public meeting Thursday night to discuss the King tribute campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt, however, said a boycott clearly will not work. The $160-million bayfront 
facility, scheduled to open in November, has conventions scheduled through the 
end of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Jacobson, a coordinator of the Martin Luther King Tribute Coalition, said 
members of the group also will meet to review options. Lacking the money for an 
initiative campaign, he called for the council to put the matter on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor virtually ruled out that tactic, saying a victory in such a referendum 
would not be binding on the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Efforts Lagging 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a privately backed effort to build a statue or other King 
memorial in Balboa Park and establish a scholarship fund in his name also is 
languishing. William Nelson, chairman of the 18-month-old Martin Luther King 
Memorial Committee, said his group has raised $150,000 of the $750,000 it 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it's stalled," said David Twomey, assistant director of the city's 
Park and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
City Council renewed the King tribute controversy two months after the Market 
Street referendum by appointing a 21-member committee to suggest an alternative 
memorial to King, who was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
After holding hearings throughout the city, that panel selected the convention 
center. The council backed the choice in a 7-2 vote Jan. 11, but the Port 
District skirted the issue in a Feb. 21 vote. By an identical 4-3 vote, 
commissioners instead suggested making King the first inductee in an "avenue of 
honors" that would be established on the center's terrace. 
</P>
<P>
The question remained in limbo for two months until Wolfsheimer, Port District 
chairman, acceded to an April 25 request from O'Connor that the commissioners 
take a stand on renaming the convention center. The council has not addressed 
the "avenue of honors" proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen, whose vote contradicted his Jan. 17 public promise to support the King 
tribute, was the only commissioner to speak on the matter Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming that "this is a matter of pride that San Diegans have in their city," 
he said, "I am convinced after all this testimony that the vast majority in the 
community wants to retain the name 'San Diego Convention Center.' " The remark 
brought cries of "Prove it!" from King supporters in the crowd of about 200 at 
the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Avalanche of Letters' 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the vote, Larsen said he made the Jan. 17 commitment at a 
council meeting "before the two public hearings we had, before the avalanche of 
letters and calls and communications from the community" in favor of retaining 
the generic name. 
</P>
<P>
With all seven commissioners having stated their positions publicly during the 
past several months, the atmosphere at Tuesday's meeting was more subdued than 
the emotional Feb. 21 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt asked the commissioners to remember King's ideals by honoring him with 
the name change. 
</P>
<P>
"Situations like these attest to our inability, our lack of desire to deal with 
the question of race relations in a pluralistic city," he said. "Our refusal 
allows the baser side of ourselves to hold on to prejudice, bias, racism, 
insensitivity, and to vent it when it's publicly perceived appropriate to do 
so." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the name change continued to stress that the convention center 
name is a crucial selling point in convention marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is, and rightfully should be, the economics of the San Diego 
Convention Center and its impact on this community, the jobs to be provided and 
the name recognition," said Robert Pruett, leader of the main opposition group. 
"We are selling San Diego and creating a greater economic base by which all San 
Diegans will benefit. Those who have booked conventions have booked the San 
Diego Convention Center."

2 HELD IN CHURCH SLAYINGS; FAMILY ROW SEEN AS MOTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A recently paroled robber and auto thief and his half brother have been 
arrested in the shotgun slayings of two women inside a South-Central Los 
Angeles church, and police said Tuesday the attack was the result of a domestic 
dispute rather than gang warfare or random violence. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Oliver, 27, and Albert Lewis Jr., 33, were booked on suspicion of 
murder in the shooting deaths Friday evening of Patronella (Pat) Luke, 35, and 
Mae Lee, 76, at Mt. Olive Church of God in Christ on 21st Street at Naomi 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
A gifted soprano, Luke was shot in the face and killed instantly. She was 
Lewis' cousin by marriage. Lee, a regional Church of God in Christ official 
known for her volunteer work among the homeless and infirm, was shot in the 
back as she ran in fright from the room. She is not related to Luke or the 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Luke's husband, Peter, was wounded in the leg and arm. He remained hospitalized 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings had led several churches in the area to take extra security 
precautions and prompted calls from the clergy for greater involvement in the 
fight against gang crimes and other violence in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth confirmed Tuesday that investigators 
believe that the church attack was the result of a domestic dispute, but he 
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators did not indicate which suspect was the alleged triggerman. Both 
men were held without bail pending arraignment today. 
</P>
<P>
Only hours before the church shooting, Lewis' estranged wife, Cynthia, had 
obtained a court order prohibiting her husband from harassing her or her 
family, sources close to the family said. Earlier Friday, Lewis allegedly fired 
a gun into a car owned by a member of his estranged wife's family and set fire 
to two other vehicles. He had also threatened to kill his wife, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police statement, half brothers Oliver and Lewis were arrested 
about 7 p.m. Monday at a house in the 100 block of West 117th Street that Lewis 
had shared with his wife before they separated. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Oliver had terrorized the neighborhood all weekend and, at one 
point, brandished a shotgun at a teen-age girl. 
</P>
<P>
A convicted robber and auto thief, Oliver was paroled from Folsom state prison 
on May 13, according to prison records. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, police said, was wanted for receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Church members had told reporters Saturday they thought that the domestic 
dispute and the shotgun attack were connected. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and family said Cynthia Lewis, Pat Luke's first cousin, is a member of 
the Mt. Olive congregation and would have been at the Friday service with the 
Lukes had she not gone into hiding to avoid contact with her estranged husband. 
</P>
<P>
The evening service was being held for about 30 children and teen-agers who had 
graduated from the church's vacation Bible school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longtime Members 
</P>
<P>
Pat Luke's family have been members of Mt. Olive for four generations, Cynthia 
Lewis' family for three, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a church member who knows the families well, the Lewises were 
married about a year ago in one of the largest weddings ever held at the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
"The only wedding that was bigger than theirs was Pat and Peter (Lukes')" six 
years earlier, said the member, who did not want to be identified by name. 
"There were about five or six hundred people." 
</P>
<P>
The Lewis' marriage quickly soured, she said, because Lewis physically 
assaulted his wife and otherwise abused her almost from the day they were wed. 
Although Lewis was a member of the congregation, the church member said, he 
seldom attended services. 
</P>
<P>
"They were separated and he wanted her back, but he had mistreated her so 
badly," the church member said. "He was just so angry. He had a very violent 
temper." 
</P>
<P>
People who were neighbors of the couple when Cynthia Lewis lived with her 
husband said they often heard what sounded like fighting at the couple's home. 
</P>
<P>
They also said that Anthony Oliver, in the two days after the church attack, 
became involved in several arguments with people he threatened to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Holt, 35, said her 15-year-old daughter had teased Oliver on Sunday and 
that he had become enraged. 
</P>
<P>
"He went to his car trunk and took out a sawed-off shotgun. He told her he 
would kill her," Holt said. "We all ran into the house screaming." 
</P>
<P>
Holt said she was particularly afraid of Oliver because he had bragged that he 
had recently gotten out of prison, for murder. 
</P>
<P>
"He had killing in his eyes," Holt said. "He was one scary looking man." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blocked Off Street 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, when police arrived to arrest Oliver and Lewis, she said, officers 
blocked off both ends of the street and surrounded the house. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver, she said, "was out in the yard and they (officers) put their guns up to 
his head. I was so glad to see them take him away. He would have killed us for 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
Holt said Lewis was inside the house when police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Booth would only say that the arrests were made without incident. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a church official speculated that Cynthia Lewis' relatives may have 
been shot Friday simply because Lewis' estranged husband associated them with 
his marital problems. The official noted that the cars damaged Friday belonged 
to members of the family of Cynthia Lewis' mother. 
</P>
<P>
According to accounts given over the weekend by people who were in the church 
when the shooting started, two men armed with sawed-off shotguns and dressed in 
black from head to toe, with their faces mostly covered, showed up outside the 
church at about 9 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A church member who had been standing outside jumped over a porch railing and 
fled. He was shot at but not hit. 
</P>
<P>
One of the armed men then entered the church and walked deliberately up and 
down the aisle before pointing the gun at a pew where Pat Luke and her mother 
were sitting. He fired, the blast hitting Luke in the face. 
</P>
<P>
Luke's husband, who was sitting several rows in front of her, was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for Pat Luke will be held at 10 a.m. Tuesday of next week at 
Mt. Olive church. Arrangements for Mae Lee were incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the church shooting, Los Angeles County Supervisors on Tuesday 
declared Aug. 4 to 6 a "Weekend of Prayer" and urged "congregations of all 
churches, regardless of faith, to participate in this effort to end the 
bloodshed and bring peace back to our neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, in whose district the church is located, requested the 
action, saying that the killings have "sent shock waves throughout our 
community, which is already burdened with fear and sorrow" and "illustrate only 
too clearly how out of control violence has become in Los Angeles County."

Florida Gov. Bob Martinez called a special legislative session for October to 
consider new restrictions on abortions. In a letter to state House and Senate 
leaders, the governor called for legislation to block the use of tax money, 
public facilities and public employees for abortions, and for tougher licensing 
standards for abortion clinics. He also urged that the period of pregnancy in 
which the state does not restrict abortion be shortened, to five months from 
six months. The call for a special session to begin Oct. 10 was a reaction to a 
recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that allows states greater leeway in 
regulating abortion. Martinez said he does not want to stop rape or incest 
victims from getting abortions, or women whose lives are threatened by a 
pregnancy.

A House subcommittee granted a postponement until Sept. 15 for a second 
appearance by Samuel R. Pierce Jr., former secretary of the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. He was previously scheduled to appear Aug. 4. 
Pierce requested a delay on grounds that he was having difficulty in retaining 
an attorney to accompany him to a hearing of the House Government Operations 
subcommittee on employment and housing, which has been investigating political 
favoritism and mismanagement at HUD during his tenure. The postponement was 
granted by Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), subcommittee chairman.

A "considerable" number of Vietnamese refugees were hurt in weekend clashes 
with police at a crowded Hong Kong detention center, said Robert Van Leeuwen, 
U.N. high commissioner for refugees in the British colony. Officials said it is 
unclear whether the death of a 59-year-old man was connected to the 
disturbances, which broke out at the Sek Kong military base where about 7,200 
boat people live in army tents pitched on a runway at a military airfield. 
Vietnamese refugees later carried crude cardboard posters around the camp 
saying in English: "Royal Hong Kong Police Kill Vietnamese Refugee."

WRIGHT CASE LAWYER MAY PROBE GINGRICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House Ethics Committee said it plans to hire the Chicago law firm that 
conducted the Jim Wright investigation to review a complaint against Republican 
Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Gingrich's charges against Wright led to an 
11-month investigation conducted by Richard J. Phelan, of the firm Phelan, Pope 
&amp; John Ltd. Wright quit as Speaker and resigned from the House after the 
committee charged him with 69 rules violations. Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.) 
accused Gingrich, who arranged a controversial investment partnership to 
promote a book he co-authored, in a complaint last April of violating campaign 
finance laws, House limits on outside income and a House rule preventing 
acceptance of gifts from those with a direct interest in legislation. Gingrich 
has called Alexander's charges "baseless." A member of the law firm said Phelan 
would be the lead attorney if the House Administration Committee approves a 
contract.

CHACON PROBE FINDS INSUFFICIENT PROOF OF BRIBERY, D.A. REPORTS

An investigation into Assemblyman Pete Chacon's receipt of $7,500 from a 
check-cashers organization in 1988 has failed to find sufficient evidence to 
support charging Chacon with accepting a bribe, prosecutors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon, a San Diego Democrat, took the money from the California Check Cashers 
Assn. after he abandoned legislation opposed by the group, according to a 
report released by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the money -- $4,000 -- came on the same day the bill was 
shelved, with Chacon's acquiescence, by an Assembly committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing of these honoraria certainly raises suspicions," Sacramento County 
Dist. Atty. Steve White wrote in a letter released by Van de Kamp. But White 
added: "There is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 
the contributions amounted to a bribe." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's office conducted the investigation and then referred its findings 
to White and San Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller. All three officials 
agreed that no charges should be filed against Chacon, according to Deputy 
Atty. Gen. W. Scott Thorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon was on vacation Tuesday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier interviews, he insisted that the timing of the payments was a 
coincidence and said that the money did not prompt him to drop the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The payment was to compensate Chacon for touring several Los Angeles-area 
check-cashing businesses and later meeting with the trade association's Board 
of Directors, according to Chacon and Tom Nix Jr., the president of the 
organization. Nix said the group invited Chacon to see the businesses because 
it was believed that the lawmaker knew little about the check-cashing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon's bill would have limited the fees that check cashers could charge to 1% 
on government checks, payroll checks, traveler's checks, money orders and 
cashier's checks. Fees for cashing other checks would have been limited to 
1.5%. Nix said most check cashers charge 1.5% to 2%, although some charge much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was also opposed by the Department of Corporations and had no recorded 
supporters other than Chacon. This prompted Assemblyman Patrick Johnston 
(D-Stockton), chairman of the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee, to 
suggest that Chacon send the bill to "interim study," effectively killing it. 
</P>
<P>
White's letter quoted Johnston as saying he noticed "absolutely nothing unusual 
or out of line about the behavior of any of the parties." 
</P>
<P>
There is no law prohibiting state legislators from receiving money from a trade 
group supporting or opposing their legislation. Such payments constitute a 
crime only if the parties agree that the money is in exchange for some sort of 
legislative action, according to the attorney general's office.

PORT CLOSURE THREATENED IN SKIRMISHING ON OIL DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Appropriations Committee, in an expression of frustration over 
offshore drilling bans, Tuesday approved a measure that would force oil ports 
to close in 1991 if prohibitions on drilling in nearby waters remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise action, introduced by Sen. James A. McClure (R-Idaho), appeared to 
be intended to put an end to the moratorium process that has put California off 
limits to offshore oil drilling for a decade and stirred the rancor of senators 
who favor exploration for oil. 
</P>
<P>
The economic impact of a port shutdown on cities such as Long Beach would be so 
catastrophic that opponents of offshore drilling would have little choice but 
to stop barring new oil exploration by congressional mandate, supporters and 
critics said. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the port-closing measure, which was attached to an Interior 
Department funding bill on a 12-10 vote, appeared likely to at least force 
Congress to limit the scope of a sweeping one-year offshore drilling moratorium 
recently approved by the House. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium, which was accepted reluctantly by the Senate panel as part of 
the appropriations bill, bars new oil exploration within 84 million acres of 
American coastline, including the entire length of California, through October, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acknowledge Dilemma 
</P>
<P>
Even staunch drilling advocates acknowledged that public concern about oil 
spills, particularly the Exxon Valdez disaster off the Alaskan coast, had made 
it impossible to vote against a moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than oppose a moratorium outright, they sought to turn that public 
concern to their advantage, arguing that any coastal waters too sensitive to be 
exposed to drilling ought also to be protected from more hazardous oil tanker 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"If an area is really sensitive," said Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), "let's 
close it." 
</P>
<P>
The amendment would bar oil-carrying tankers from entering any U.S. waters in 
which oil exploration was prohibited beginning in October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the amended measure prompted cries of outrage from drilling critics, 
who denounced the port closing provision as "mischievous" and "irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a distortion," said California Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), 
sponsor of earlier bills that have put most of California off limits to 
drilling since 1981. "They're saying: 'If you don't like drilling, we'll take 
your tankers away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like planting a time bomb," said Lisa Speer, an attorney for the 
Natural Resources Defense Council. "It's a ploy to pressure the states that 
have moratoriums to drop them." 
</P>
<P>
But other environmentalists acknowledged that the port-closing measure puts 
them in a difficult position because it appears to echo their own concerns 
about the risks that oil exploration poses to environmentally sensitive 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
And many expressed concern that, if enacted by the Senate, the threat could be 
used as a negotiating chip to force the House to abandon a provision that would 
prevent the Interior Department from conducting even preliminary drilling 
studies off California. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Department, which opposes the drilling moratorium but had not 
expected to block it altogether, had made elimination of the ban on preleasing 
activity a top priority. The provision affords special protection to a vast 
area off Central California, where progress toward a scheduled 1991 lease sale 
otherwise would go unhindered. 
</P>
<P>
In a victory for the Administration, the Senate panel agreed to delete the 
preleasing activity ban from the legislation on grounds that it would block 
crucial studies designed to assess whether drilling might pose an environmental 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
While the committee approved the rest of the drilling moratorium, it voiced 
strong reservations, criticizing what it described as "ineffective" efforts by 
the House to address public concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand emotions," warned Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), an outspoken 
supporter of the oil industry, "but we're not supposed to be tossed along on 
the frothy sea of emotion. We're supposed to deal with facts." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.), an advocate of the moratorium, urged his 
colleagues to be patient in large part because "the nation is recoiling from 
oil spills." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the misgivings on the part of the committee, champions of the drilling 
ban expressed confidence that they could win approval of a comprehensive 
moratorium when the measure reaches the Senate floor. A vote could come as 
early as today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexpected Twist 
</P>
<P>
"The committee approval of the leasing moratorium is an important victory in 
our battle to protect the California coast from oil and gas development," said 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). As for the moratorium on preleasing activity, 
Cranston said: "I expect we will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
The introduction by McClure of the port-closing provision added an unexpected 
twist to what had been a straightforward battle between pro-exploration and 
anti-drilling forces. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers interpreted the provision as a deliberate effort by the Senate 
committee to "tweak" California, which has wielded its legislative power in the 
House to protect itself from new offshore drilling while profiting enormously 
from the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what you're witnessing is a regional dispute," said Steve Goldstein, 
an Interior Department official. "California's predominance in the House has 
tended to bring about a rather parochial point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials praised the McClure measure for focusing attention on 
the fact that tankers have proven more likely to cause oil spills than have 
offshore drilling platforms. But they refused to address the merits of the 
proposal, indicating only that the measure "served its purpose." 
</P>
<P>
A stronger reaction came from the oil industry, which contended that the 
measure might block its product from American markets if ports were indeed 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are vehemently opposed to that amendment," the American Petroleum Institute 
said in a statement, "and we will work to strike it from the bill."

SAN DIEGO EFFORT TO SELECT MEMORIAL TO DR. KING COLLAPSES 
</P>

<P>
An 18-month effort to select a memorial to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
ended in failure Tuesday when the San Diego Unified Port District commissioners 
rejected the City Council's request to rename the city's bay-front convention 
center for the slain civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
In a 4-3 decision, Commissioners Daniel Larsen, Raymond Burk, Milford Portwood 
and Robert Penner voted to support Burk's motion to retain the name San Diego 
Convention Center, established in a 1985 contract between the city and the port 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Louis Wolfsheimer, William Rick and Delton Reopelle, who 
supported the council-backed name, San Diego Martin Luther King Convention 
Center, voted against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was the second repudiation of a San Diego tribute to King in less 
than two years. In a November, 1987, referendum, San Diego voters reversed a 
council decision to rename Market Street as Martin Luther King Jr. Way and 
returned the downtown thoroughfare's original name. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the drive to honor King vowed to pursue the racially and politically 
sensitive tribute effort, which has divided the city and dogged public 
officials since the council's April, 1986, decision to rename Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Pratt, the lone black on the council and a leader of the King tribute 
effort, said that the city still must find a suitable memorial to King and 
promised to press for renewed council action. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego has to come to grips with its ethnic diversity at some point in 
time," Pratt said after the commissioners' decision at a special meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But a weary-sounding Mayor Maureen O'Connor said it was too soon to decide 
whether to place the issue before the council again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Consensus 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I'm not prepared to say which way we'd go," O'Connor said in an 
interview. "I mean, really, we've tried this every which way and we seem to be 
running into a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, it appears to be difficult to find a solution that would 
satisfy a majority," O'Connor added. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Stevens, who has led an unsuccessful boycott of the Convention 
Center since the port commissioners dodged the name change issue in February, 
called a public meeting for Thursday night to plot strategy in the King tribute 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt, however, said that a boycott clearly would not work. The $160-million 
bay-front facility, scheduled to open in November, has already scheduled 
conventions through the end of the 1990s. Jim Jacobson, a coordinator of the 
Martin Luther King Tribute Coalition, said members of the organization also 
will meet to review options. Lacking the money for an initiative campaign, he 
called for the council to put the matter on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor virtually ruled out that tactic, saying that a victory in such a 
referendum would not be binding on the commissioners.

INS ACTED UNFAIRLY IN DEEMING REQUESTS FOR ASYLUM AS 'FRIVOLOUS,' U.S. JUDGE 
SAYS 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge, dealing a blow to the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
detention program in South Texas, has ruled that the INS has unfairly denied 
work permits to applicants for political asylum whose stories were deemed too 
"frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
In granting a preliminary injunction on Friday for 13 asylum applicants, U.S. 
District Judge William Wayne Justice said that the INS had denied work permits 
in an arbitrary fashion, based largely on brief interviews with applicants, and 
that immigration officials were dismissing cases as frivolous that on closer 
examination could merit the granting of asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the judge ruled that the interview process appeared to have been used 
as a tool to catch aliens contradicting themselves, rather than as a way to 
supplement the asylum applications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Significant' 
</P>
<P>
The text of the decision, which was made available to reporters Tuesday, was 
deemed "very significant " by immigrant rights lawyer Robert Rubin of the San 
Francisco-based Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs. Rubin, one of the lawyers 
who argued the case before Judge Justice, said that the next step would be to 
expand the case to a class action suit. 
</P>
<P>
INS spokesman Duke Austin said on Tuesday that the preliminary injunction was 
still being studied by government attorneys and that the practical effects of 
the ruling were still uncertain. He did say, however, that it seemed to be a 
step toward shifting the burden of proving eligibility from the alien to the 
immigration service in work permit requests. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to see where we go from here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, the INS has had a policy of detaining Central American refugees 
in a camp near Brownsville, Tex., until their requests for asylum had either 
been granted or denied. The INS has maintained that such a policy was necessary 
because without detention, applicants would immediately disappear and become a 
part of the underground world of illegal aliens. The INS also contended that it 
was being deluged by a flood of frivolous asylum applications and that 
detaining aliens was a way of stemming the flow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detention Premise 
</P>
<P>
"This decision tends to undermine the entire premise of the South Texas 
detention policy," said Rubin. "That policy was based upon the INS claim that 
individuals were abusing the asylum system by filing frivolous asylum claims 
and therefore detention was necessary. Now a federal judge has determined that 
the INS has been misapplying the frivolous standard and thus the whole 
justification for the detention policy must be questioned." 
</P>
<P>
Justice said that the inability to work during the asylum application process 
"may compel an applicant to abandon his or her asylum application and return to 
his or her native country. Not only would this deprive the applicant of the 
opportunity to urge his or her application through the entire review process, 
but would, in substantial likelihood, subject the applicant to even more severe 
persecution upon return to the country he or she has attempted to flee." 
</P>
<P>
Austin said that if the work permit standards are relaxed, the political asylum 
process would turn into nothing more than a "temporary work program" because 
asylum applicants could remain in the United States for years while using all 
the appeals procedures available to them. 
</P>
<P>
He also said, as the INS has long contended, that relaxing the work permit 
standards "will serve as a tremendous magnet." 
</P>
<P>
The INS attempted to make that case in arguments before Justice, saying that 
there would be a flood of illegal aliens that would "significantly harm the 
INS' ability to control our borders." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said the INS had been unable to produce evidence to support its 
predictions, and therefore the court could give them no credence.

CAMBODIAN TALKS COLLAPSE, JUST DAYS BEFORE 20-NATION CONFERENCE IN PARIS

Preliminary talks between resistance leaders and the Vietnamese-backed 
Cambodian government broke down Tuesday, only a few days before a scheduled 
20-nation Paris peace conference aimed at ending the Cambodian civil war. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the four parties scheduled for today was canceled. However, French 
diplomats insisted that the international conference, which is to include U.S. 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze among others, will begin Sunday as planned. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the three main resistance groups and the government of 
Premier Hun Sen said they failed to reach agreement even on the simplest 
matters of protocol in several hours of talks at the French Foreign Ministry 
chateau in this Paris suburb. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one delegate said, the leaders -- Hun Sen, Prince Norodom 
Sihanouk, Khmer Rouge representative Khieu Samphan and the Khmer People's 
National Liberation Front leader, Son Sann -- failed to agree even on name 
cards to be used at the peace conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Hun Sen said we could not even use the word Cambodia in our name," said the 
delegate, who is affiliated with Son Sann's anti-Communist group. 
</P>
<P>
As Sihanouk left the meeting site, he said: "It is not worth the trouble to 
meet again. The disagreement is total." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is "very, very pessimistic" about the prospects for a political 
settlement at the international conference. He said the preliminary meetings, 
which were to set the stage for the larger conference, broke down on several 
key points, including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sihanouk and the other resistance leaders favor a U.N. peacekeeping force 
to monitor the promised withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. The Hun 
Sen government opposes such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hun Sen has proposed an immediate cease-fire. Resistance leaders say this 
would favor the Hanoi-backed regime and the Vietnamese troops still in place. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Resistance leaders contend that Hun Sen's government should be part of the 
Vietnamese delegation to the international conference because it is supported 
by Vietnamese troops. Hun Sen considers his government the valid Cambodian 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In a compromise move, resistence leaders have agreed to join with Hun Sen 
in a united Cambodian delegation to the international conference. However, Hun 
Sen favors two separate Cambodian delegations and refuses to join any 
delegation that includes the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept being placed in a single Cambodian delegation," Hun Sen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said: "To recognize two Cambodias would be fatal to our country." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences, Hun Sen was slightly more optimistic than Sihanouk 
about the international peace conference. He conceded that the talks Monday and 
Tuesday had "taken a step backward." But he said "the international conference 
should take place independent of the negotiations between Cambodians." 
</P>
<P>
To show his good faith, the government leader repeated his offer for a 
cease-fire and for the first time offered a specific timetable for the 
withdrawal of the 60,000 to 70,000 Vietnamese troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The final total withdrawal will take place Sept. 21-26 by land, river and 
sea," Hun Sen said. "From Sept. 27, all Vietnamese volunteers will have been 
completely withdrawn from Cambodia."

CUBA AGAIN ATTACKS U.S. ON DRUG INFORMATION 
</P>

CAMAGUEY, Cuba 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preoccupied with its worst scandal in 30 years, Cuba on Tuesday again accused 
the United States of not sharing information that might have earlier exposed 
the Cuban military and intelligence officers who were executed or imprisoned 
after a court-martial found them guilty of drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban complaint contradicted diplomatic reports in Havana that American 
officials on at least six occasions this year brought information about Cuban 
drug trafficking to the attention of Cuba's Foreign Ministry. The informal 
American protests were made both before and during the two-month Cuban 
investigation that exposed the country's top military hero and a covey of 
government officials as drug traffickers, the diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
But Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ricardo Alarcon, at a news conference 
said: "It is absolutely false that U.S. authorities have given any type of 
information whatsoever to Cuban authorities. . . . We received no information 
whatsoever prior to the arrest of these persons, nor any information after they 
were arrested." 
</P>
<P>
Cuban army Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez and three lesser-ranking officers 
were shot by firing squad July 13, and 10 other officers of the army and the 
Interior Ministry's intelligence branch were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony in their court-martial, a major part of the 
drug-trafficking plot was uncovered only in the course of an investigation of 
suspected sex escapades and black-marketeering while Ochoa was head of the 
Cuban military mission in Angola. 
</P>
<P>
His connection, along with the Interior Ministry officials, to the drug trade 
came as an bombshell to the Cuban leadership, according to explanations in 
speeches by President Fidel Castro and his brother, Defense Minister Raul 
Castro. In one of the speeches, on July 9, Castro accused the United States of 
not warning him that Cuban officers were trafficking in cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating Castro's charge, Alarcon complained that even though he personally 
asked a high-ranking State Department official last January to provide 
information concerning drug traffic through Cuba, "until this moment no 
information has been provided." 
</P>
<P>
But the diplomatic sources here insisted that American diplomats in Havana 
repeatedly informed Alarcon and other officials of what was taking place in 
Cuban airspace and territorial waters, where U.S. anti-drug officials say they 
had tracked more than 60 suspected drug flights since early 1988. Whether the 
Americans actually passed along the names of some of the Cuban officers 
believed to be involved was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
"The representations were not a casual thing," one diplomat said about the U.S. 
efforts to inform the Castro government. "It was understood that this was very 
serious and they ought to look into it." 
</P>
<P>
In a scolding tone, Alarcon repeated Castro's earlier request for "some form of 
communication between Cuba and the United States in this common battle." 
</P>
<P>
According to the diplomatic sources, the earlier U.S. representations were 
"shrugged off" by the Cubans. This seeming indifference led to an assumption by 
American officials that the drug smuggling had been approved at the highest 
level in Havana, perhaps by Raul Castro or even Fidel Castro himself, the 
diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
However, most European and Latin American diplomats interviewed this week say 
they now believe the Castro brothers were genuinely shocked by the revelations 
and had no previous knowledge of the heavy drug traffic across Cuba.

CANADA FOREST FIRES BLACKEN 2 MILLION ACRES

Thundershowers rumbled across Manitoba and Saskatchewan provinces on Tuesday, 
spilling light rain onto hundreds of forest fires that have blackened more than 
2.2 million acres across a wide area of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Officials held out hope that more rain, expected overnight, would dampen the 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
The worst forest fires in Manitoba's history have consumed about 3,500 square 
miles of land -- more than the combined area of Delaware and Rhode Island -- 
and continued to burn Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Another 1,500 people were evacuated Tuesday from Manitoba, bringing to nearly 
21,000 the number forced to leave their homes by more than 225 separate forest 
fires, officials said. At least 50 of the fires are burning out of control. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 communities are affected, most of them reserves for Canadian Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Fires have been burning in northern Manitoba since May, but a combination of 
dry weather, temperatures in the 90-degree range and lightning sparked major 
blazes over the past 10 days, provincial government spokesman Terry Laferriere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots trying to pick up people fleeing the fires have been frustrated by smoke 
so thick it has turned the sun into a reddish smudge. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence McDougall, 28, was among the hundreds of people evacuated Tuesday from 
the Garden Hill Island Lake Reserve, about 400 miles northeast of Winnipeg, as 
firefighters controlled the fires burning within a mile of the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents Panicked 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are taking it in stride, but others are panicking," said 
McDougall, who is staying in a hotel in Brandon. "The smoke is so bad you can't 
even see your next-door neighbor. This is the worst I've ever seen in my life." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sunlight to speak of at all," Northern Affairs Minister Jim Downey 
said after returning from the sparsely populated region late Monday. "It's like 
dusk in the middle of the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Downey had flown with Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon to Thompson, The Pas and 
Flin Flon, where evacuees were being taken. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sometimes an hour-to-hour situation, waiting for the smoke to lift to a 
point where a plane can land," provincial government spokeswoman Diana Soroka 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, a mining city of about 15,000, has taken in more than 3,000 evacuees. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters sprayed water on a wooden railroad bridge just east of Thompson 
that is being used to transport evacuees. 
</P>
<P>
"If that bridge goes out, then that escape route is cut off to Churchill," 
Manitoba Natural Resources Minister Harry Enns told a news conference. 
Churchill is 260 miles northeast of Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
The fire zone begins about 250 miles north of Winnipeg and stretches about 220 
miles from northeastern Saskatchewan to northwestern Ontario.

3 AMBASSADORIAL NOMINATIONS SQUEAK BY IN SENATE COMMITTEE

Three of President Bush's ambassadorial nominees, whom Democrats said had no 
qualifications except political connections, won narrow approval Tuesday from 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) joined the Republican members as the panel first 
voted, 10 to 9, to send to the Senate floor the nomination of Florida real 
estate developer Joseph Zappala to be ambassador to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in voice votes, the committee approved the equally controversial 
nominations of Florida real estate developer Marvin Sembler to be ambassador to 
Australia and Della Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker, to be 
ambassador to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Robb said later that he was troubled over Zappala's "quite thin" qualifications 
for the job but that he felt he had made an "implicit" commitment to vote for 
the nominee when he interviewed him May 11 and did not clearly indicate that he 
would oppose him. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who led the opposition to the nominations, vowed 
to carry the fight to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
"One looks through this resume wondering why this person has been appointed to 
this position," Sarbanes said of Zappala. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is to be found in the appendix, which lists the campaign 
contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Zappala reported to the committee that he contributed $126,000 last year to 
Republican campaigns and gave $17,900 in the previous two years. His prior 
governmental experience, described on the ambassadorial evaluation form 
submitted to the committee, consisted mainly of chairing campaign finance 
committees for President Bush and the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Approvals 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the committee routinely approved the nomination of Shirley 
Temple Black to be ambassador to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
It also approved the nominations of Thomas Melady to be ambassador to the 
Vatican, William Howard Taft IV to be the permanent U.S. representative on the 
Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Keith L. Brown to be 
ambassador to Denmark, and Joseph Gildenhorn, a Washington lawyer and real 
estate developer, to be ambassador to Switzerland.

STANDARDS URGED ON DISPOSAL OF MEDICAL WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A year after used hypodermic syringes washed up along U.S. shores prompting 
howls of protest and a spate of new government regulations, the nation's 
ability to safely dispose of medical wastes has improved little, a House 
subcommittee was told Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
To better protect the environment from potentially infectious wastes, Rep. Ron 
Wyden (D-Ore.) said that the federal government should set new national 
standards for handling and disposal of medical castoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Wyden, chairman of a House Small Business subcommittee that is investigating 
the issue, said that the "crazy quilt" of laws and regulations adopted after 
the incidents last year has created unintended disincentives to the proper 
disposal of medical waste. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urges Incinerators 
</P>
<P>
Wyden stressed the need to build government-operated regional incinerators to 
take the place of private facilities. Currently, about 90% of U.S. hospitals 
burn their own waste, but tougher emissions laws are expected to make many 
incinerators obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who testified at a hearing before Wyden's subcommittee on 
regulation, business opportunities and energy said that the government needs to 
become more active in dealing with the problem, but they offered few specific 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Recent private and government reports have noted a lack of consensus on what 
constitutes infectious waste and the extent to which it poses a public health 
threat. Some states have no regulations, while others have rules that sometimes 
work at cross purposes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tracking Act Passed 
</P>
<P>
So far, the federal government's response to the problem has been limited. Last 
year, Congress passed the Medical Waste Tracking Act, a measure designed to 
chart the course of waste from hospitals to disposals. 
</P>
<P>
Several officials testified that the act has been successful, but they said its 
scope is too restricted. They said that better state coordination and national 
waste standards focusing on the larger problem of dumping might be more 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the waste products that washed up on beaches last summer did not come 
from hospitals but were illegally dumped, often by drug users, several experts 
said, acknowledging that a solution to that problem will be difficult to 
devise. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a whole lot more to the problem than adding up the sum of the 
muck that washes up," Wyden said.

The Senate Finance Committee approved a $60-billion increase in the nation's 
debt ceiling Tuesday, the first in two years, amid warnings that Social 
Security and other benefits will not be paid in September if the increase is 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The panel approved a hike to $2.86 trillion from the current $2.8 trillion to 
let the government pay its bills through Oct. 31. If the measure is approved by 
the full Senate and House, the debt ceiling will have to be increased again 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) proposed the three-month rise 
instead of an increase approved on May 17 by the House as part of its budget 
plan. The House proposed increasing the ceiling by $322.7 billion to $3.12 
trillion.

An opposition member of Parliament has called on President Pieter W. Botha to 
resign over alleged illegal use of a police vehicle to transport dead antelope 
after a hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Fanie Jacobs, told a news conference Monday that the carcasses of eight bucks, 
a cow and two wildebeest, all clearly labeled "State President P.W. Botha," 
were found during a routine check on a truck at a roadblock last week. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, from the ultra-rightist Conservative Party, said the truck was a police 
vehicle with false plates and that its insignia was deliberately concealed. The 
driver did not have the written authorization required to transport dead meat, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the president's office confirmed that Botha was on a hunt at a 
game farm last week but denied any wrongdoing in transporting the kill.

CAMP PENDLETON NAMED ON AIRPORT SITE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
An Orange County site-selection group has chosen three potential locations for 
a new regional airport, and one of them is in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The suggested south Camp Pendleton site, about 3 miles north of Oceanside, 
would be an international airport serving 10.3 million passengers annually 
beginning in the year 2010, according to a proposal drawn up by Orange County 
Airport Site Coalition. The coalition is looking for a site to relieve crowding 
at Orange County's John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants envision a passenger terminal with 14 gates, as well as cargo 
and general-aviation facilities. The 3,190 acre facility would cost $5.496 
billion. Funding was not spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Pendleton site, the group chose Norton Air Force Base in San 
Bernardino and a location in the Cleveland National Forest northeast of San 
Juan Capistrano as finalists. The Cleveland forest location, a plateau called 
Potrero Los Pinos, is the only one of the three finalists within Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials also are considering a second San Diego County site, 
McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, as one of five backup locations in case 
the Camp Pendleton site or the two other finalists they identified last weekend 
-- prove unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
There is general agreement among government officials in San Diego County that 
both Camp Pendleton and McClellan-Palomar are off limits as replacement sites 
for San Diego's Lindbergh Field, and Marine Corps officials say they are 
adamantly opposed to giving up part of Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
"Local policy is very clear on both of these sites," said Jack Koerper, special 
projects director at the San Diego Assn. of Governments. "It would be very 
difficult to do politically in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Sandag released a study saying that San Diego would have one of the 
nation's most congested airports and lose billions of dollars in forfeited 
economic growth if no new airport for San Diego is built by 2010. The study 
compared the long-term economic impact of a new airport to that of Lindbergh 
Field, but did not endorse either. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed alternatives to Lindbergh include two sites in and next to the Miramar 
Naval Air Station and one along the U. S.-Mexican border on Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is attempting to find solutions to its airport question inside the 
San Diego region," said Koerper, who headed the study made public Monday, a 
continuing Sandag report of San Diego's airport system. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County, or the Los Angeles area, has taken a different point of view, 
especially Orange County, by looking both inside and outside Orange County for 
solutions to air carrier problems." 
</P>
<P>
Gunnery Sgt. Stan Pederson, a Marine Corps spokesman at Camp Pendleton, said 
Tuesday that senior officers there are sticking by a January statement saying 
they would "strenuously oppose all proposals to locate a regional airport" at 
the base. 
</P>
<P>
"We will take every measure necessary to prevent this from happening," Pederson 
read from the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just tossing these ideas around," said an aide to San Diego 
Councilman Ron Roberts, a major proponent of a new San Diego airport. "It just 
goes to show you the measure of desperation when it comes to air transportation 
planning in Southern California. It's critical." 
</P>
<P>
The president of the Orange County Airport Site Coalition, meanwhile, said the 
group was "site-neutral" when it chose the three potential locations for a new 
airport at a meeting Saturday in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"We're only concerned with alleviating the year 2010 demand of more than 22 
million air passengers a year in Orange County," Leland Oliver said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In case any of the three chosen sites proved unworkable, the coalition 
fashioned a backup list that included McClellan-Palomar and four other 
possibilities. The group is sanctioned by the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors and has been aided by professional planning consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors are not required to adopt the coalition's final recommendations 
or choose any site. However, Oliver said Saturday that the group will work to 
build political pressure on behalf of its final recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the sites dropped from consideration was El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
because the coalition's staff concluded that selection of the military base 
would face significant political opposition and that there would be major costs 
in relocating military operations elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
McClellan-Palomar was projected to be a "short-haul," as opposed to an 
international airport with three gates for up to 2.3 million passengers a year 
beginning in 2005. Though it would continue to handle general aviation traffic, 
it would not have cargo service, according to the consultants. They estimated 
it would cost $619.85 million to expand that airport. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants' projections for all locations assume that the process of 
obtaining money and government approvals would get under way in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne Airport now serves a maximum of 4.75 million passengers annually, 
with a new ceiling of 8.4 million when a new terminal and parking garages are 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Although many studies of airport sites have been filed over the years, a new 
search was required under terms of a 1985 court settlement between Orange 
County supervisors and the city of Newport Beach over planned expansion at John 
Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's final report is due in December, Oliver said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: PAINT DOESN'T CURB HIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ANTHONY PERRY

<TEXT>
<P>
Desire for Publicity 
</P>
<P>
Roger Boesky, a commercial real estate developer, doesn't believe in asking the 
government for favors. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than plead with City Hall to redress the parking problems outside his 
SeaCoast Square shopping center, at Garnet Avenue and Mission Boulevard in 
Pacific Beach, Boesky did it himself. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered the curb along Garnet painted white. White designates a passenger 
loading zone, where parking is limited to three minutes, which would discourage 
all-day beach-goers from tying up the spots. 
</P>
<P>
Every little bit helps, Boesky figured. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a parking space in Pacific Beach, particularly one near Crystal Pier, 
is about as easy as finding a beachfront home in La Jolla for $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky notified the city of his work. He insists the curb was white when he 
bought the building in 1983, but the color had since faded. 
</P>
<P>
The Engineering and Development Department could find no record of ever 
authorizing that side of Garnet and Mission as a white zone. It sent an 
inspector to inspect. It sent a letter to Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to discourage free-lance curb painting," said supervisor Craig 
Tennesen. Among other things, it confuses the meter maids. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the city takes a patient, almost parental, attitude toward people who 
paint their own curbs. Often, the city ends up painting the curb the same 
color. 
</P>
<P>
One solution, said city traffic engineer Massoud Sammak, would be to paint two 
spaces white and sandblast the two others back to their native gray. If so, 
Boesky will be billed $100. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky, a second cousin to fallen financier Ivan Boesky, can live with that. He 
gets half a loaf of parking and something even more precious: publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have any idea how hard it is to get some public relations for a 
shopping center?" he asked. "I have another building in Del Mar. If I paint the 
curb there, can I get a story out of that, too?" 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, I'm checking out the red-zone artists of Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
As the Worm Turns 
</P>
<P>
If you have a lemon, make lemonade. And if you have earthworm castings, make 
fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
The Fallbrook Sanitary District wants to make a buck from the droppings left by 
the worms that nibble at sludge created during waste-water treatment. But first 
it needs a catchy name. 
</P>
<P>
So it held a contest and attracted 150 entries. Four persons submitted the same 
name and will now split 3 cubic yards of fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
The winning name: Fallbrook Vermigro. That's vermi (worms) and gro 
(fertilizer). 
</P>
<P>
Among the losing entries: Vertigro, Castings of Thousands, Vermix, Vermiverde, 
Vermade, Wormade, Sludge Fudge, Fertilverm, Brown Poopon and more. 
</P>
<P>
"A few others were descriptive but perhaps a bit inappropriate," General 
Manager Ben Price said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Windows Into History 
</P>
<P>
Update: Arnold Hunsberger is willing to help the new owners of the El Cortez 
Hotel in downtown San Diego rehabilitate the outside glass elevator. 
</P>
<P>
For unknown reasons, it had lapsed into local legend that the elevator, the 
first such in the country, had been built by a now-defunct German firm. 
</P>
<P>
That's what the owners told the city's Historical Site Board in explaining why 
plans to renovate and reopen the 61-year-old landmark did not include fixing up 
the elevator. 
</P>
<P>
The truth, said Hunsberger, is that the elevator was built in 1955 by a San 
Diego firm called Elevator Electric that he owned with two partners. The three 
went on to build 1,000 glass elevators.

EVIDENCE LACKING TO CHARGE CHACON

An investigation into Assemblyman Peter Chacon's receipt of $7,500 from a check 
cashers' organization in 1988 has failed to find sufficient evidence to support 
charging Chacon with accepting a bribe, prosecutors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon, a San Diego Democrat, took the money from the California Check Cashers 
Assn. after he abandoned legislation opposed by the group, according to a 
report released by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the money -- $4,000 -- came on the same day the bill was 
shelved, with Chacon's acquiescence, by an Assembly committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing of these honorariums certainly raises suspicions," Sacramento 
County Dist. Atty. Steve White wrote in a letter released by Van de Kamp. But, 
White added, "There is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
that the contributions amounted to a bribe." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's office conducted the investigation and then referred its findings 
to White and San Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller. All three officials 
agreed that no charges should be filed against Chacon, according to Deputy 
Atty. Gen. W. Scott Thorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon was on vacation Tuesday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier interviews, Chacon insisted that the timing of the payments was a 
coincidence and said that the money did not prompt him to drop the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The payment was to compensate Chacon for touring several Los Angeles-area check 
cashing businesses and later meeting with the trade association's board of 
directors, according to Chacon and Tom Nix Jr., the president of the 
organization. Nix said the group invited Chacon to see the businesses because 
it was felt that the lawmaker knew little about the check-cashing industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limiting of Fees 
</P>
<P>
Chacon's bill would have limited the fees that check cashers could charge to 1% 
on government checks, payroll checks, traveler's checks, money orders and 
cashier's checks. Fees for cashing other checks would have been limited to 
1.5%. Nix said most check cashers charge 1.5% to 2%, although some charge much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was also opposed by the Department of Corporations and had no recorded 
supporters other than Chacon. This prompted Assemblyman Patrick Johnston 
(D-Stockton), chairman of the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee, to 
suggest that Chacon send the bill to "interim study," effectively killing it. 
</P>
<P>
White's letter quoted Johnston as saying he noticed "absolutely nothing unusual 
or out of line about the behavior of any of the parties." 
</P>
<P>
There is no law prohibiting state legislators from receiving money from a trade 
group supporting or opposing their legislation.

VALDEZ LEAKS PUT LAWMAKERS IN LATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State legislators criticized the Coast Guard and several state agencies Tuesday 
for an uncoordinated response to discharges by the Exxon Valdez off the San 
Diego coast and called for reforms of oil-spill prevention and response 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing in San Diego of the Assembly Select Committee on Oil-Spill 
Prevention and Response Preparedness, Assembly members heard testimony from 
several agencies involved in bringing the Valdez to San Diego, and criticized 
most for their performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a whole bunch of agencies that are supposed to be ready to respond, 
and it's nebulous who's got the responsibility," Assemblyman Gerald Felando 
(R-San Pedro) said. "I don't think any of them performed above a 'C.' " 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), chairman of the committee, added: 
"Everybody we heard from this morning, I and other members of the committee 
found fault with. What should have been a relatively minor incident was not 
handled very well." 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of state agencies maintained that they had not mishandled 
the situation, and Exxon Shipping Co. officials defended their own actions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statement by Exxon Spokesman 
</P>
<P>
"I think everything that can reasonably be done, both on Exxon's standpoint and 
the state's, has been done," Tom Gillette, the company's external affairs 
adviser, told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The crippled Valdez drifted about 4 miles off San Clemente Island Tuesday while 
divers trimmed dangling steel from its hull. The salvage team on Monday 
finished cutting off the seven massive steel plates that jutted from the oil 
tanker's bottom and prevented its entry into the bay, but will spend two to 
three more days trimming away steel that threatens to peel. 
</P>
<P>
The ship may be ready to enter San Diego Bay and dry dock at National Steel 
&amp; Shipbuilding for repairs by Friday, but weekend boating traffic may delay 
the entry until Monday, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement between the state and Exxon Shipping that will allow the ship into 
San Diego Bay had not been made final by late Tuesday. Representatives of Exxon 
and several state agencies at the hearing said they signed the agreement, but 
were awaiting a signature from the Regional Water Quality Control Board in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly committee was formed after the Valdez' massive oil spill in Alaska 
to evaluate the California's ability to handle oil-spill incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Felando criticized Alaska officials for being unprepared for the 
Valdez's spill of 11 million gallons of oil in Prince William Sound, and blamed 
them for "80 to 90%" of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the same situation right here in California, and we've got to 
correct it," Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
Felando and Lempert also criticized the state's reluctance to inspect the 
Valdez before it left Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will hold more hearings in the fall throughout Southern 
California and will encourage legislation to change the state's procedures for 
responding to oil-spill incidents. The only other committee member present 
Tuesday was Assemblywoman Lucy Killea, (D-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
"There's some very good legislation pending, and we'll have to see what of that 
makes sense," Lempert said. " . . . All I do know is that we have to put 
together a clear chain of command." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Task 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of state agencies said Tuesday that the task will be a 
difficult one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complex process with all the agencies now. But, day in and day out, it 
works reasonably well. It really does," said Reed Smith, pollution response 
coordinator for the state Department of Fish and Game. "It would be a massive 
undertaking to change" the roles of state and federal agencies in responding to 
oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Tuesday, test results from seawater within the ship's 
damaged tanks showed barely detectable, nontoxic amounts of crude oil, the 
Coast Guard reported. Toxic substances were found in water from the ship's 
intact tanks, but are not considered a threat because the tanks are closed and 
that water will be pumped to a barge as soon as the ship reaches dry dock. 
</P>
<P>
However, tests of a waxy residue mixture of weathered oil and marine life on 
the tanks' walls and of an oily sheen on top of the water within the tanks have 
yet to be analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Samples from a brown patch of material seen floating upwind from the tanker 
Friday contained Alaskan North Slope crude oil, the same substance found in 
discharges from the ship, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Exxon had reported that the ship had not discharged any material for a 
week. But the Coast Guard said another small emission of a bluish substance 
came from the ship Monday when a steel plate was removed. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard and Exxon officials acknowledged Tuesday that the Valdez may 
discharge while being brought into the bay, but said any material coming from 
the vessel would be unlikely to threaten the marine environment. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard has opened an investigation into the Valdez's discharges off 
San Diego's shores, which may lead to civil and criminal penalties against 
Exxon, the Coast Guard said Tuesday.

MARINE STUDY FINDS BOOT CAMP STRESS DIDN'T CAUSE 3 SUICIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Marine Corps Recruit Depot's commanding officer Tuesday released findings 
showing that the stress and pressure of boot camp were not the cause of three 
recruit suicides in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The results of a three-month suicide study were released at a press conference 
called by Brig. Gen. Frank J. Breth, who assumed command of the Marine Corps 
Recruit Depot one month before the last recruit died of a self-inflicted bullet 
wound Dec. 1, 1988. Another Marine recruit also shot himself to death July 1, 
and a third hanged himself March 16, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Breth said he was disturbed by the deaths and commissioned a special task force 
to study the causes, means and prevention of recruit suicides at MCRD. 
According to the panel's findings, "the pressure and stress of boot camp did 
not cause any of the recent suicides." 
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, there is no reason to radically change training in an effort to 
prevent recruit suicides," said the report. 
</P>
<P>
However, the study also said that the "controlled and stressful (training) 
environment was a factor which probably contributed to the end result." In two 
of the three suicides, the recruits had received "Dear John" letters before 
their deaths, but the report said there was "no common pattern or facts linking 
the recent suicides." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Increasing Phenomenon' 
</P>
<P>
However, one similarity noted in the report was that, in each death, the 
recruit told other recruits or relatives that he was contemplating suicide. But 
this information was not made available to drill instructors or other Marine 
officials in time to prevent the suicide, according to Col. C. W. Cheatham, who 
headed the task force. 
</P>
<P>
The task force reported that suicide among young adults is an "increasing 
phenomenon" in society that is becoming acceptable as a "way out of perplexing 
problems." The report said "it would be naive to believe that we in the Marine 
Corps can escape this attitude completely." 
</P>
<P>
The task force examined the cases of 188 recruits who were discharged from 1987 
to date for "suicidal ideation." The panel found that most of the men were 
"malingerers" and not serious suicide threats. Instead, they threatened to kill 
themselves because "these were young men who were very out of place here and 
wished to go home," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Corps showed that there have been eight suicides at 
MCRD since 1970 and 39 deaths from all causes. Two of the three suicides in 
1988 occurred at Camp Pendleton firing ranges. The report also cited a 
"near-fatal paralysis" resulting from an incident last year at a Camp Pendleton 
range, but did not say if it sprang from a suicide attempt or accidental 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The panel that put together the report was composed entirely of military 
officials, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, chaplain and a drill 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report found no reason to change the training at the MCRD in order 
to minimize the chances of suicide, it appeared to find at least one fault with 
the present system. The report noted that a suicidal recruit may only ask for 
help once "because of the system in recruit training . . . then internalize his 
feelings until the opportunity arises for suicide." 
</P>
<P>
The panel suggested several recommendations to prevent suicides, including 
teaching drill instructors and recruits to look for certain "warning signs." 
Recruits should also be allowed to "relax" during their free time, the report 
said, and said that too many "training and administrative details" now cut into 
recruits' free time. Recruiters now use a screening list to weed out recruits 
who might be suicidal, said Breth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
25,000 Recruits a Year 
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 recruits each year go through MCRD, which has been training 
Marines since 1923. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Breth and Col. Regan R. Wright, also told the press 
conference that Marine Corps officials will fight any attempts by the Port 
District to expand Lindbergh Field north to the base. Expanding Lindbergh Field 
is one option being studied by the to modernize San Diego's airport. Others 
include moving it to two sites near Miramar Naval Air Station and to Brown 
Field, near Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe that MCRD is the answer," Breth said. '. . . We are concerned 
about encroachment. Historically, we have given a lot to San Diego, but there 
is no more left." 
</P>
<P>
When MCRD was established, it covered 800 acres. But, since 1937, the Marines 
have ceded most of the original tract to the city and Port District. Today, the 
training depot covers only 388 acres and one training area borders a Lindbergh 
Field runway. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any property to give up for airport expansion," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Port District wants MCRD, it would have to wield political muscle in 
Congress, said Breth, because the Corps will not give it up voluntarily. Some 
supporters of expansion have said the recruit depot could easily be moved to 
sprawling Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
But Breth said it would cost at least $1 billion to open a new facility at Camp 
Pendleton. He said MCRD is an economic boon for San Diego because it generates 
millions in income for the city from visitors who come to see the base museum 
and visit the recruits.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chula Vista insurance broker charged with faking a death to collect on a life 
insurance policy pleaded guilty to federal mail-fraud charges Tuesday before 
the scheduled start of his trial. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had accused Arsenio Albert Ainza of submitting a fraudulent 
$200,000 life insurance claim on behalf of an accomplice, complete with 
cremated human remains purported to be those of the deceased, according to 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol C. Lam. After the Transamerica Occidental Life 
Insurance Co. paid the claim, its investigators found the "dead" policyholder 
living in Ensenada, Mexico, Lam said. 
</P>
<P>
Ainza, whose trial was to begin Tuesday before U. S. District Judge J. Lawrence 
Irving, pleaded guilty after working out an agreement with prosecutors, 
according to Lam. In exchange for his plea, no charges will be filed against 
him in a similar case involving the Sovereign Life Insurance Co., Lam said. 
</P>
<P>
Ainza's wife, Anna S. Ainza, pleaded guilty Monday to obstructing the mails in 
the Sovereign Life case. Lam said she will recommend probation for Anna Ainza. 
Arsenio Ainza faces a maximum sentence of five years, she said. Both remain 
free on a $50,000 bond, pending sentencing Oct. 16.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: BONITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Carlsbad chiropractor pleaded not guilty Tuesday to setting a fire at a 
Bonita store on which swastikas were spray-painted before the business was 
torched. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Wofford, 41, was ordered held in County Jail in lieu of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Lamborn said Wofford "was caught literally in the act 
of setting a fire at a store in Bonita." 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest Friday by a passing sheriff's deputy, Wofford told the deputy 
that the Iraqi store owner was "evil," Lamborn said in the courtroom of 
Municipal Court Judge John Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Wofford told the deputy: "I'm not your average arsonist. 
There's more than meets the eye. I had a reason for doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Lamborn said the remarks were made while Wofford was being taken to jail after 
his arrest near the Bonita Market. 
</P>
<P>
A flammable liquid had been poured inside the store on newspapers piled up at 
the entrance and ignited, according to Lamborn. Damage to the store and a 
neighboring Catholic church was $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson set a bail review for Friday and a preliminary hearing for Aug. 7.

BACKER OF ELSMERE DUMP PLAN DISPUTES NEGATIVE FINDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of BKK Corp., which hopes to open a landfill in Elsmere Canyon by 
1991, said Tuesday that he was stunned that an environmental impact report on 
the proposed expansion of the nearby Sunshine Canyon Landfill declared Elsmere 
a poor choice for a dump. 
</P>
<P>
"You're kidding," said BKK President Kenneth B. Kazarian when told of the 
report's conclusions. Kazarian said he had not seen the report, which was 
released last week. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the report is an effort by a competing corporation to boost 
its own dump proposal by criticizing his firm's site. 
</P>
<P>
BKK, based in Torrance, is preparing its own environmental impact report on the 
proposed dump in Elsmere Canyon, which lies about two miles northeast of the 
Golden State-Antelope Valley Freeway interchange. Kazarian said he is confident 
that geological and environmental studies will conclude that Elsmere is an 
ideal landfill site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Consultant 
</P>
<P>
The report on the proposed expansion of the Sunshine Canyon dump northwest of 
Granada Hills was prepared by a private consulting firm for the landfill's 
owner, Browning-Ferris Industries. The report said the only irreversible effect 
of expanding the dump would be destruction of 8,000 oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
The thick, three-volume report devoted hundreds of pages, charts and graphs to 
the potential impact of expanding Sunshine Canyon but also used 14 pages to 
explain why Elsmere Canyon should not be used as a dump. 
</P>
<P>
The report said Browning-Ferris once considered Elsmere as a dump site but 
rejected the idea. The report said soil permeability tests showed that the 
canyon's floor was not suitable for a dump and would require a liner. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said nearby faults could produce earthquakes on the site. The 
canyon could also hold historic buildings, oil drilling equipment and 
archeological sites, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Sites Found 
</P>
<P>
The report conceded that no archeological sites have been discovered in the 
canyon but said such discoveries are always possible because Indian tribes did 
live in the region. The report also said the canyon could contain fossils of 
more than 50 species, including whales and camels. 
</P>
<P>
Kazarian said the report for Browning-Ferris apparently drew its conclusions 
from incomplete data. "They're talking about the wrong area," Kazarian argued, 
saying his consultants have found no archeologically significant sites in the 
canyon. The oil drilling equipment lies outside the canyon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the canyon's soil, he said BKK plans to install protective liners that 
will exceed the requirements of state environmental law. Kazarian stressed that 
he had not yet seen the report but said that some of its conclusions appear 
"intellectually dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Takes a Shot' 
</P>
<P>
He said he had never seen an environmental impact report that "takes a shot" 
against a competing project. "That's what it sounds like at this point," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, in comments included in the 
Sunshine Canyon report, said the department was not aware of any technical data 
to substantiate the criticisms of Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the Elsmere Canyon Preservation Committee, a Santa 
Clarita citizens group, said they were encouraged by the report's conclusions. 
The report could give the group "good, solid ammunition" for its fight against 
BKK's plans, said Glen Rollins, a group member.

ANOTHER MONUMENTAL BATTLE IN THE WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what suddenly is becoming a part of San Fernando Valley protest culture, 
another group of homeowners is hoping to halt a shopping center development by 
having the site declared a "cultural monument." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Sherman Oaks said Tuesday that they may ask Los Angeles officials 
to award landmark status to a 1940s-era row of storefronts that until recently 
housed the famed Scene of the Crime mystery bookstore and other neighborhood 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
Such a designation would stall a developer hoping to replace the block-long 
collection of one-story shops with a new three-story building. The one-year 
delay would give the city time to pass a proposed law restricting construction 
in the 13600 block of Ventura Boulevard to only two stories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsuccessful Appeal 
</P>
<P>
Residents of next-door Studio City were unsuccessful last week in an appeal to 
the city's Cultural Heritage Commission for cultural monument status for a 
carwash, gas station and coffee shop at Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards. 
Their campaign -- which focused worldwide attention on the Studio City corner 
-- was aimed at delaying construction of a $15-million mini-mall until it could 
be redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Close, president of the influential Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., said 
residents have asked his group to press for such a designation for the 
storefronts after Jama Enterprises quietly applied last week for a demolition 
permit for the block. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Michael Woo interceded to temporarily block the permit, 
complaining that Jama reneged on a promise to discuss its planned development 
with homeowners before seeking any city permits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we've been asked to look at by a lot of residents," Close said. 
"It could help us accomplish our goal." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Close and Woo both accused Jama of racing to beat the proposed 
two-story height limit, included in a preliminary Ventura Boulevard 
growth-control recommendation expected to be acted on later this year by the 
Planning Commission and City Council. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Jama's lawyer, Benjamin M. Reznik, challenged the accusation and 
Woo's suspension of the demolition permit. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said Woo "overreacted, to say the least." He said Jama Enterprises 
promised homeowners that it would discuss the project before it sought a 
building permit for the new structure, not a demolition permit for the old 
storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
He said development plans are being prepared and will be shared with Woo and 
homeowners when they are completed. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said he believes that Woo had no legal right to prevent the demolition 
permit from being issued last week. He said Jama will file a lawsuit if the 
city tries to delay the project until after the City Council votes on the 
boulevard growth controls. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can get back to logic, calmness and reason and allow that stretch of 
old buildings that are falling apart to be removed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unaware of homeowners' plans, Reznik joked: "I shouldn't feel too bad. At least 
it's not being considered a cultural landmark." 
</P>
<P>
He could not be reached Tuesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Brueggemann, a deputy to Woo, predicted that such a campaign would fail. 
"We looked into landmark designation for that site at the first of the year," 
she said. "Our impression was it didn't qualify." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historical Preservation 
</P>
<P>
Other Valley-area residents, meanwhile, have indicated that they may turn to 
historical preservation to cope with what they consider overdevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
In Calabasas, residents have started a drive to declare a block-long row of 
60-year-old storefronts in Old Town a state "Point of Historical Interest" to 
block builders. 
</P>
<P>
And in Woodland Hills, residents hinted this week that they may seek a cultural 
or historical designation for 63 old-fashioned street lamps in their community 
if the city does not drop a proposal to replace them with modern light 
standards.

ALLEGED MASTERMIND OF JAILBREAK, 2 OTHERS CHARGED IN MURDER OF BURBANK JEWELER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three men, including an alleged master jewel thief and planner of a daring 
Orange County jailbreak last year, have been charged with the murder of a 
Burbank jeweler who was gunned down during a failed robbery in 1987, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects -- all in California jails or prisons -- are accused of slaying T. 
W. Hamilton, 50, on July 9, 1987, in his jewelry store, Creme de Le Gem, on 
West Magnolia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were identified by Burbank police as Michael Douglas Taylor, 36, 
of Chicago; and Joe Ledezma, 25, and Thomas Estrada, 27, both of the Los 
Angeles area. Each was charged with murder and armed robbery, Sgt. Don Goldberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is in the Orange County Jail and the other two suspects are in state 
prisons serving sentences for parole violations. Taylor allegedly masterminded 
a November escape from the Orange County Jail in which five inmates used 
bedsheets to climb down the side of the four-story building. Taylor was not 
captured until May. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that when armed robbers entered the jewelry store, Hamilton pulled 
out his own gun and traded shots before he was fatally wounded. The robbers 
escaped without any merchandise, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Shortly after the robbery, detectives started focusing on Taylor," said 
Goldberg. "That was based on a composite description of the suspect provided by 
witnesses and his known method of operation." 
</P>
<P>
However, Goldberg said, investigators did not have enough evidence to charge 
Taylor, although at the time Taylor was at large and suspected of as many as 50 
armed robberies in the Los Angeles area, many of jewelry stores. 
</P>
<P>
The break in the case came this year when Burbank investigators received help 
from Orange County sheriff's deputies, FBI agents in Des Moines, Iowa, and 
Seattle police. Goldberg declined to reveal what evidence came from those 
agencies, but said each had been involved in investigations of Taylor's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was arrested last year in Orange County and was being held on seven 
counts of armed robbery when he escaped Nov. 20 from the jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The breakout triggered a nationwide manhunt. One escapee was caught 
immediately, one surrendered a week later and two others were captured two 
weeks after that in Denver. Taylor traveled as far as Maine and eluded capture 
until May 20 when he was arrested in Rapid City, S.D., while trying to pawn 
diamonds believed stolen from a Chicago jewelry store. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that during his six months of freedom Taylor was suspected of 
a cross-country crime spree that included robberies in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., 
Des Moines and Denver; and a kidnaping, rape and attempted murder in Albany, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was described by Goldberg and other investigators as a "big time" 
criminal with a reputation for boldness. Police who searched a home that Taylor 
had abandoned on Puget Sound in Washington, found of photograph of Taylor 
posing beside an FBI poster of wanted fugitives.

STATE ASKS FOR TIGHTER RESTRICTIONS ON LOPEZ CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials Tuesday rejected as too lenient a Los Angeles County order 
restricting use of Lopez Canyon Landfill, owned by the city of Los Angeles, and 
asked the county to draft a tougher version by the end of the day today. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't feel that it did what we asked them to do," said Chris Peck, 
spokesman for the California Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
The county Department of Health Services acts as the state's enforcement agency 
for Lopez Canyon Landfill, located above Lake View Terrace in the northeast San 
Fernando Valley. As the only Los Angeles city-owned dump, Lopez Canyon receives 
about two-thirds of the city's residential trash. City officials say closing it 
will hasten a trash-disposal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Avila, president of the city Board of Public Works, said he was 
concerned about the state's response to the county order. Avila described the 
county order as "at least fair" and said the state's proposed changes could 
make it more difficult for the city to comply. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Questions 
</P>
<P>
William Pellman, senior assistant county counsel, said the county may not 
legally be able to alter an order it already has issued. Pellman said attorneys 
would review the state request today. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the state board, the county issued an order Friday offering 
the city three options: Close the dump immediately, submit a plan to comply 
within 60 days with stringent state restrictions based on a 1978 permit, or 
apply for a new permit. 
</P>
<P>
What bothers the state is a provision in the county order that allowed the city 
to rely, while it applied for a new permit, on operating guidelines contained 
in a 1983 engineering report, Peck said. On July 7, the state had asked the 
county to issue an order forcing the dump to return to a level of operations 
agreed to when the 1978 permit was issued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Order 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's request asked the county to agree by tonight to issue a new order by 
Friday imposing that restriction. 
</P>
<P>
Disagreement over which document -- 1983 or 1978 -- is valid forms the crux of 
the city's legal challenge to the state order, which continues at a hearing 
Aug. 4 in Los Angeles Superior Court. The city maintains that the later report 
automatically became part of its permit. 
</P>
<P>
"We operated under the 1983 requirements for six years and nobody said a 
thing," Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
The key differences between the two documents are restrictions on landfill 
elevation, circumference and on the number of trucks that can dump there daily. 
</P>
<P>
The 1978 permit included a reference to a 1977 engineering report that limited 
the landfill to a 1,725-foot elevation -- 35 feet lower than it is now -- and 
said it could accept trash from only 400 trucks a day. Recent logs indicate 
that as many as 600 trucks dump there daily. The original permit also 
restricted dumping to a 140-acre area of the 392-acre site, but the city has 
dumped outside that area in several locations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full in a Year 
</P>
<P>
The city has said that if the restrictions of 1978 are reimposed, the dump will 
be declared full within a year and will have to close. The height limit is the 
most difficult to meet, Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Coffee, who oversees the dump as director of the county's Solid Waste 
Management Program, said the state's proposed change in the order does not 
appear unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
However, Coffee said he would have to discuss it with attorneys from the county 
counsel's office, who helped draft the Friday order.

LANCASTER WATER BOARD OFFICIAL PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN ARSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Antelope Valley water board member who was arrested following a fire that 
heavily damaged his Lancaster home has pleaded not guilty to arson, authorities 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn D. Martin, 66, a member of the Antelope Valley-East Kern Water Agency 
board of directors, was arrested Monday on suspicion of arson of a residential 
dwelling, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who was released after his arraignment on $10,000 bail, is suspected of 
setting a fire Thursday in his home in the 500 block of East Avenue J, Deputy 
Ron Thomason said. Damage to the home was estimated at $90,000, and county fire 
reports say that an "unauthorized junkyard" on the property hindered efforts to 
extinguish the 3:45 p.m. fire and also endangered firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a 12-year member of the water agency board who was elected to a fourth 
four-year term in November, has previously clashed with the city over the 
storage of junk metal and other debris on his property, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Junk Illegally Stored 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Martin, who associates said is retired from the U.S. Air Force and 
once served as a fighter pilot during World War II, was convicted under the 
city's nuisance law of illegally storing junk at his home, Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
The city then cleared the debris from his property. However, Martin appealed 
the conviction and began collecting junk on his property again, Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
If Martin is convicted of the felony arson charge, he could face a penalty 
ranging from probation to eight years in prison, authorities said. Under state 
law, he would also be forced to resign from the water agency if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he is not convicted," said Mike Riddell, the water agency's attorney. 
"It's a sad situation. He has devoted most of his life to public service and 
now this happens." 
</P>
<P>
Martin could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

CAR KILLS GIRL, 8, ON SIDEWALK; DRIVER HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A car driven by a suspected drunk driver crossed onto a sidewalk in North 
Hollywood on Tuesday, striking and killing an 8-year-old girl, Los Angeles 
police reported. The driver was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter while 
intoxicated, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, whose name was withheld until relatives could be notified, was 
pronounced dead at Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley following the 
2:35 p.m. accident, Officer Frank Zdroy said. The girl was thrown approximately 
60 feet in the accident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Michael Murray, 62, of Montrose, was being held at the Van Nuys Division 
jail, Zdroy said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray was driving east on Victory Boulevard near Carpenter Avenue when his car 
crossed into opposing traffic lanes and onto a sidewalk where the girl was 
standing, Zdroy said. After hitting the girl, the car continued until it was 
stopped by several trees and a fence, Zdroy said.

BURBANK WORRIED OVER EFFECT OF SMOG RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of the city of Burbank, which has some of the worst air pollution in 
the state, said Tuesday that they are worried about the economic and technical 
impacts of proposed regulations designed to reduce pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald V. Stassi, general manager of the city's Public Service Department, said 
that if the South Coast Air Quality Management District orders Burbank to 
modify power plants by Dec. 31, 1996 -- as is being considered -- the city's 
utilities would be severely strained. 
</P>
<P>
He added that electric rates would go up by as much as 15% to cover the cost of 
modifying the city's plants, which could be as high as $70 million. In 
addition, Stassi said the reliability of the electrical system could be 
jeopardized if energy generating units are taken out of service for periods of 
up to 18 months for modification. 
</P>
<P>
However, Stassi said the city must comply with the regulations if they are 
adopted by the district, which is meeting next month to consider rules to 
reduce pollution from industries throughout the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Committed to Cleanup 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned, but we're committed to cleaning the air," Stassi said. "We're 
just trying to find the most effective ways to do it." 
</P>
<P>
A report by the board last year named the Burbank area -- which included 
Glendale and North Hollywood -- as an air pollution "hot spot." Hot spots are 
areas that show significantly higher concentrations of toxic air contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
Concentrations in the Burbank area pose a cancer risk that, although low, is 
twice as high as in other areas of Los Angeles, the report said. The increased 
risk means that the amount of contaminants could cause cancer in 100 of 100,000 
people exposed to the present levels for at least 70 years, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena have already been asked by state 
agencies to voluntarily reduce their present emissions of toxic pollutants 90% 
by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
83% Reduction 
</P>
<P>
Stassi said Burbank has already reduced its emissions 83% from 1,200 pounds per 
year in 1978 to less than 200 pounds in 1986. Because 75% of the city's power 
comes from outside sources, Stassi said it would be very difficult for Burbank 
to further reduce its emissions by modifying power plants. 
</P>
<P>
The rules under consideration include requiring industries to put catalytic 
reduction equipment or the equivalent on gas and steam turbine generating 
units. Stassi said that installing the equipment would require that large 
amounts of hazardous ammonia -- needed for the pollution control equipment -- 
be transported through the city and stored at the power plants on a regular 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
If the rules are adopted by the air board, the city would ask the agency for a 
three-year extension to modify its power plants, Stassi said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he did not think that residents would mind the rate increase. "I 
think most residents feel that if the air is cleaner, that will be enough value 
for their investment," he said.

DEL MAR'S 50TH SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
STEVENS SEEKING THREE IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Stevens has a right to complain about his 1989 season, but few would 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens has won more than $6 million in purses this year, putting him fourth in 
the national standings as the Del Mar meeting begins today. 
</P>
<P>
But Stevens has been somewhat of a forgotten man, a far cry from recent years 
when he was either battling for the national title or winning the Kentucky 
Derby. While Laffit Pincay, Pat Day, Bill Shoemaker and Patrick Valenzuela have 
been getting the headlines, Stevens has been plugging along, making money. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Idaho native will be seeking his third consecutive Del Mar 
crown. Only Shoemaker has won three consecutive titles at the race course, 
which begins its 50th meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with where I am in the national standings because I don't feel 
I've had that good a year," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of his campaign is Stevens' richest win, the $516,900 Illinois Derby on 
May 27 at Sportsman's Park near Chicago. His mount, the California-based Music 
Merci, won the race on the disqualification of Notation. But the ruling has 
been challenged by the losing owners, which leaves Stevens' 10% cut of the 
$310,140 winning purse in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens hopes to use a third Del Mar title to launch a late-season streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It's relaxed and laid-back, all right, but it's also the most competitive meet 
in California," Stevens said. "It's a short meet, there's a lot of money 
involved, and most of the riders take a vacation after it's over. As a result, 
you find yourself scurrying to win as much as you can." 
</P>
<P>
In only four seasons at Del Mar, Stevens has won nearly all of the top races, 
including the Ramona Handicap, the Eddie Read Handicap and the Del Mar 
Debutante twice. But the one he remembers best is the 1987 Del Mar Oaks aboard 
Lizzy Hare, an English filly. 
</P>
<P>
"In her race just before the Oaks she dropped me (while) pulling up," Stevens 
said. "I was knocked unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came back in the Oaks she didn't really figure. It was a big field, 
she had a bad post and she didn't have any speed. We had to come through a lot 
of traffic and she still won. It was such a satisfying win I even named my dog 
after her." 
</P>
<P>
Lizzy Hare -- the pedigreed Rhodesian ridgeback, that is -- and the rest of the 
Stevens family have settled into a new home near the beach at Del Mar. The clan 
recently welcomed Riley Garrett Stevens, born July 21 to Gary and his wife 
Toni. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens will ride eight of the nine races on opening day, but he will be aboard 
longshots Trebizond and Tokatee in divisions of the featured Oceanside Stakes 
for 3-year-olds at a mile on the Kikuyu grass turf course. 
</P>
<P>
The solid choice in the first division of the Oceanside will be Joseph 
Scardino's Bruho, who gave Stevens a wild ride at Del Mar last year in the 
Balboa Stakes. While clearly on his way to an easy victory, Bruho veered 
suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like the horse just disappeared out from under me," Stevens said. "I 
had nowhere to go but down." 
</P>
<P>
Corey Black now rides Bruho for trainer Julio Canani. 
</P>
<P>
Shelly Meredith's Hawkster will get a lot of attention in the Oceanside's 
second division after finishing fifth in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and 
Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Said trainer Ron McAnally, who hopes Hawkster finally lives up to his morning 
drills: 
</P>
<P>
"At least I think he should do a little better than fifth in here. After all, 
there's no Easy Goer or Sunday Silence." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence is on the grounds, but it is not known if he will race here. And 
despite its cramped, antiquated grandstand and overpopulated stable area, Del 
Mar also has attracted horses such as Bayakoa, Rahy, Claire Marine, Annoconnor, 
Pranke, Olympic Prospect, Sam Who and Magical Mile. 
</P>
<P>
Opening-day purses for the nine races total $301,000, compared to $341,550 and 
$234,800 for the most recent openers at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a track that, as recently as 1986, offered barely $200,000 a day in 
purses and didn't get its first Grade I race until 1984. 
</P>
<P>
When Hollywood Park and Santa Anita began simulcast betting on the Del Mar 
races last summer, the daily handle soared; increased purse money followed. 
Southland racing fans ended up betting more off-track, $165,957,948, than 
on-track, $122,754,420, during the 1988 Del Mar meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not that sleepy little track anymore, are we?" said Joe Harper, Del Mar 
executive vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
"But we try hard to preserve the traditional atmosphere, even though our 
numbers are up there with the big tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"The strangest feeling, though, is when I look at the size of the betting 
pools, then look around at the live crowd. It took me a while to figure out 
where all the money was coming from. This is what I'd call a very popular 
television show." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar runs for 43 days through Sept. 13, with racing Wednesday through Monday 
beginning at 2 p.m. . . . The Del Mar races will be televised nightly on KDOC 
(Channel 56) from 8 to 8:30, on Prime Ticket from 10:30 to 11 and in the San 
Diego area on KTTY (Channel 69) from midnight to 12:30. . . . Trevor Denman, 
fresh from a stint calling races in Maryland, will be back in the booth for Del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Wayne Lukas will be going for his third straight Del Mar title. . . . 
Del Mar management is negotiating with Bill Shoemaker's agents regarding a 
special farewell tribute to the jockey sometime during the meeting. Shoemaker 
broke Johnny Longden's record for winners at Del Mar on Sept. 5, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEL MAR AT A GLANCE 
</P>

BRAY WINS GOLD ON SPLIT DECISION

<P>
John Bray knew what he wanted to do and he knew what he had to do. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the two didn't coincide. 
</P>
<P>
Bray wanted a knockout. What he got was a split decision and a U. S. Olympic 
Festival gold medal in the 201-pound division. 
</P>
<P>
And at the end of three rounds, he felt fortunate enough to have that. Bray, 
who fights out of Van Nuys, defeated Javier Alvarez of Austin, Texas, 3-2, in a 
decision that was greeted unenthusiastically by a crowd of 6,632 at the Myriad 
Exhibit Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Neither fighter was particularly impressive at any stage of the fight. Bray, 
who ran his record to 76-8 with 50 knockouts, was most effective in the second 
round, when he circled Alvarez and scored with jabs. 
</P>
<P>
That strategy was in stark contrast to the way he started the fight -- by 
throwing roundhouse punches in search of a quick knockout. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to take me out," said Alvarez, a 27-year-old veteran of more 
than 300 amateur fights. "We he found out he couldn't do that, he played it 
smart. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a close fight, and he deserved it. He was working harder than me." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bray: "I got away from my game plan. He made me lose my composure. He got 
me upset and I let emotions take over the fight. I let ego come into play. I 
should have fought three rounds like I fought the second." 
</P>
<P>
Bray's victory avenged a 5-0 decision he lost to Alvarez in the semifinals of 
the U. S. Amateur championships. More importantly, it gained Bray a berth in 
the U. S. Olympic Box-Off in Concord, Calif., next week. The winner of the 
box-off will represent the United States at the world championships in Moscow, 
Sept. 17-30. 
</P>
<P>
The Festival champion automatically qualifies for the box-off against a boxer 
from his weight category chosen by a selection committee to be "the most worthy 
opponent." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez is expected to be that boxer for Bray. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Jason Evans of Chatsworth singled and scored a run, but the West dropped an 8-3 
decision to the North in its first game of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra Feldman, the current national champion, is third in the all-around 
standings after two rounds of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, 18, of Encino, is first in the ribbon event, third in rope, third in 
ball and fourth in the hoop standings. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia's Jennifer Haase, 14, is fourth in the all-around, third in hoop, 
fifth in ribbon, tied for fifth in ball and tied for 10th in rope. 
</P>
<P>
TABLE TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
Carol Davidson of North Hollywood and partner Jim Butler of Iowa City, Iowa, 
won a bronze medal in mixed doubles with a 21-16, 21-15 decision over Dhiren 
Narotam of Ames, Iowa, and Kerry Terrel of Richland, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
FAST-PITCH SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Former Burbank high standout Debby Day was the losing pitcher as the West fell 
to the South, 1-0, behind the two-hit pitching of Rhonda Wheatley. 
</P>
<P>
Day allowed five hits, struck out three, walked one, and benefited from a 
spectacular catch by center fielder Priscilla Rouse, a former Cal State 
Northridge standout. Rouse jumped above the fence in the sixth inning to 
prevent a home run. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
Dijon Douphner of Newbury Park had 26 kills as the South defeated the North, 
14-16, 15-7, 15-11, 15-9, in the tournament opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Douphner, a Pepperdine junior, played a key role in defeating a team coached by 
Rod Wilde, a Pepperdine assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Coley Kyman, the City 3-A player of the year last season at Reseda High, 
started at middle blocker for the North and recorded 18 kills.

AMERICAN LEGION AREA PLAYOFF OPENER PITS WOODLAND HILLS WEST, WESTLAKE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a way, it will be a rubber match of sorts. This time, however, one team will 
take the first step toward bouncing the other out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday at 4 p.m., District 20 champion Woodland Hills West will face District 
16 winner Westlake-Agoura in the first round of the American Legion Area 6 
playoffs at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake-Agoura (27-3-4) and West (23-3) split two inter-district games this 
season. After each game, the losing coach was heard mumbling something about it 
being "just a scrimmage," or emphasizing that some key players were held out of 
the lineup because of upcoming district games. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes will be much higher in this time. So high, in fact, that there was 
some grousing going on before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't thrilled to hear about it," Woodland Hills West Coach Gary Gibson 
said of the pairings. "Probably the two best teams in the tournament play each 
other right off the bat. The only good thing is that we've seen them before and 
we know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday at 9 a.m., Panorama City (21-6) will face Hollywood. Panorama City, 
which lost, 12-11, to Woodland Hills West in the District 20 championship 
Sunday, received an at-large berth. At 12:30 p.m., defending state champion 
Claremont will face Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the double-elimination tournament, which concludes Saturday, 
advances to the state tournament next week in Yountville, Calif., located in 
Napa County. 
</P>
<P>
With both Westlake-Agoura and Woodland Hills West rested, Gibson promised that 
there would be no alibis offered this time. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither of us will be taking this one for granted, that's for sure," he said.

KNEE INJURY MAY SIDELINE WHITE FOR SHRINE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russell White, the state's all-time leading high school rusher, may not play in 
Saturday's Shrine all-star football game at the Rose Bowl because of tendinitis 
in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
White, who has accepted a scholarship to Cal, first injured the knee while 
running in Berkeley and aggravated the injury in an all-star game July 14. He 
sat out the second half of that game. 
</P>
<P>
White practiced Tuesday for the first time for the Shrine game but was far from 
100%, according to South Coach Bill Redell, who coached White at Crespi High. 
Redell characterized White's chances of playing Saturday as doubtful.

PANORAMA CITY NEARLY COUNTED OUT TOO SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Elling 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most members of the Woodland Hills West American Legion team started a mental 
victory countdown after taking a five-run lead in the top of the 10th inning of 
Sunday's District 20 championship game, figuring that a berth in Thursday's 
Area 6 playoffs was in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the pitcher's mound in the bottom of the inning, however, West 
right-hander Ryan McGuire was counting down in reverse. What seemed an 
elementary exercise in recording the last three outs soon became an exercise in 
elementary math for McGuire, a countdown to near-meltdown in 100-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire surrendered four runs and allowed the tying run to reach first before 
he recorded the last out in top-seeded West's 12-11 victory over second-seeded 
Panorama City at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a mess in that inning," West Coach Gary Gibson said, "but he finally 
nailed it down." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the term nailed down is a bit strong. Just say McGuire thumb-tacked this 
one, because he almost blew a 12-7 lead. With the tying run on first and the 
lead cut to one, McGuire retired Sean Henson on a called strike to end the 
4-hour, 15-minute marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept putting guys on base and I was thinking, 'OK, that's only two runs.' 
And then, 'OK, that's only three runs,' " McGuire said. "And the next thing I 
know, Roland De La Maza is up as the tying run." 
</P>
<P>
Add District 20 final: There were dramatics aplenty, though defensively, it was 
a clankfest at times. West committed four errors and Panorama City made two, 
which allowed a total of six unearned runs to score. A handful of other runs 
were tainted, coming as a result of wild pitches or passed balls. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that from a fan standpoint, it was a great game to watch," Gibson 
said. "But from a baseball standpoint, no way." 
</P>
<P>
Del Marine's two-run single helped West (23-3) score five times in the top of 
the 10th to break a 7-7 tie. After Marine's single gave West a 9-7 lead, Paul 
Geller lofted a bases-loaded fly ball to right that John Langley dropped. One 
run scored on the error, and one out later, Jason Mitchell lined a two-run 
single to left to give West a 12-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Panorama City (21-6) didn't roll over. Shane Wight singled and Joe Cascione 
walked to open the 10th, and one out later, Herman Merchan lined a run-scoring 
single to left. McGuire followed with a walk to Joe Chaparro to load the bases, 
bringing the red-hot De La Maza to the plate as the tying run. De La Maza 
homered and doubled in Saturday's 9-7 win over Woodland Hills East and earlier 
had singled in a run. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I started thinking, 'I better start doing something right now,' " 
McGuire said. "I thought I'd better start throwing the ball by somebody, and I 
ended up throwing it by my catcher." 
</P>
<P>
Facing De La Maza, McGuire fired one to the backstop, allowing Cascione to 
score from third and the runners to advance. One out later, facing Langley, 
McGuire skipped another pitch to the screen, and Merchan scored to make it 
12-10. Langley followed with a bad-hop single to center that drove in Chaparro 
and cut the lead to one. 
</P>
<P>
It came down to pitcher against pitcher. McGuire recovered and fanned Henson -- 
who pitched the 10th inning in relief of De La Maza -- on three pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping those fielders awake: Now-infamous junk bond king Michael Milken 
attended Birmingham High, site of the District 20 playoffs. In an elimination 
game on Saturday, pitchers Rich Shapiro of Woodland Hills East and Doug 
Maggiora of Newhall-Saugus shared a junk bond, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
With both teams running short on pitching, Maggiora and Shapiro were used as 
starters in East's 10-3 win. Overpowering, they weren't. 
</P>
<P>
Maggiora, a 6-foot-3, 160-pound right-hander who will be a junior at Saugus 
High, pitched 7 1/3 innings and struck out none. Shapiro, a 5-foot-7, 130-pound 
right-hander who graduated last month from Taft High, pitched eight innings and 
struck out one. 
</P>
<P>
Atten-shun: The American Legion is the largest veterans association in the 
world, with approximately 2.7 million members. When District 16 champion 
Westlake-Agoura opens play Thursday in the Area 6 playoffs, look for a pair of 
its Legion baseball vets to play front-and-center roles. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Bob Grandpre and infielder Mike Suarez have been on the team since its 
formation four years ago, and the two 1988 Westlake High graduates are 
providing leadership and firepower. 
</P>
<P>
Grandpre, a right-hander who has also been employed in the outfield and at 
first base, third base and designated-hitter, is 9-0 with an earned-run average 
of 3.15 and is batting .384 with 29 runs batted in. Suarez, who plays second 
base, is batting .416 with an area-high 18 doubles, 23 RBIs and 31 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Win a few, lose a few: Encino-Crespi was eliminated from the District 20 
playoffs with a 5-1 loss to Woodland Hills East on Friday at Pierce College, 
but Encino-Crespi Coach Scott Muckey exacted a small measure of revenge later 
that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Muckey, who also coaches the Crespi High team, led a group of Crespi players to 
the championship of an area tournament featuring undergraduate high school 
players. 
</P>
<P>
.... And my wife, she treats me like dirt: Birmingham High Coach Wayne Sink has 
long played baseball organ music over the public-address system between 
innings, but during the District 20 playoffs -- with Van Nuys-Notre Dame Coach 
Jody Breeden handling the P.A. chores -- the music went a step further. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it went from the familiar strains of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," 
to, "Take My Wife, Please." 
</P>
<P>
For Saturday's doubleheader, organ music was soon replaced with the Beatles, a 
segue to the Beach Boys, followed by Springsteen. 
</P>
<P>
And then to. . . . "I tell ya, my wife is something else. I just bought a used 
car -- and found one of her dresses in the back seat.... My luck's nothing to 
brag about, either. I found a wallet the other day -- it had a picture of my 
two kids in it.... 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, Rodney Dangerfield kept fans and players alike in laughs during 
three innings in what might be called a comic relief appearance. No word yet on 
what's planned, auditory-wise, for the six-team, 6th Area playoffs, which begin 
Thursday at Birmingham.

The uncle of comedian Eddie Murphy was sentenced to four months in jail Monday 
in Toronto for sexually assaulting a teen-age fan after one of his nephew's 
concerts. Ray Murphy Sr., 50, head of security for his nephew, pleaded guilty 
to sexual assault. The prosecuting attorney said Murphy assaulted the girl in 
July, 1986, at a hotel after promising her that she could meet Eddie Murphy. 
The girl was 18 at the time. ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: RUSSIAN PIANIST WILL REPLACE PREVIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of illness, pianist Andre Previn has canceled his two appearances next 
month at the La Jolla Chamber Music Society's SummerFest '89. Society executive 
director Neale Perl announced Tuesday that Russian pianist Yefim Bronfman will 
replace Previn at both the Aug. 20 benefit concert and the Aug. 22 chamber 
music program. The 31-year-old pianist is a veteran of many festivals, the 
Hollywood Bowl, Ravinia, New York's Mostly Mozart and last season's local 
Batiquitos Festival. He has also performed frequently and recorded with 
violinist Shlomo Mintz, as well as with the Juilliard, Guarneri and Fine Arts 
Quartets. 
</P>
<P>
On the benefit concert, Schumann's Piano Quintet will be replaced by the Brahms 
F Minor Piano Quintet; on the second program, the previously scheduled Dvorak 
Piano Quartet, will be replaced by the Shostakovich E Minor Trio. SummerFest 
'89 runs Aug. 18-27 at La Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium.

OFFICIALS STEP UP TRAPPING AFTER MEDFLY IS FOUND IN ELYSIAN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agricultural officials have found a single Mediterranean fruit fly in a peach 
tree near Dodger Stadium and have stepped up trapping in an 81-square-mile area 
to determine whether the crop-destroying pest has again gained a foothold in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But officials announced Tuesday that they do not plan to begin aerial spraying 
of the pesticide malathion unless they find a second fly. 
</P>
<P>
The fly was discovered last Thursday in the yard of an Elysian Park home during 
a routine inspection of traps. At first, officials believed that it may have 
been a sterile fly released during a recent Medfly eradication program in West 
Los Angeles. It was flown to Sacramento for examination by state entomologists 
and was found to be fertile. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials called in all of its crews over the weekend to put out 
800 additional traps in an area stretching as far north as Glendale to 
Exposition Boulevard near USC on the south. The traps near Dodger Stadium were 
checked Monday and Tuesday, and no flies were found. The other traps will be 
inspected later this week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wait and See' 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to breathe easy at this point," said Bob Atkins, the county's deputy 
agricultural commissioner. "It doesn't look like we have a raging population at 
this time. But it's still wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
If a second fly is found, officials said they will consider imposing a 
quarantine, which does not allow home-grown fruits and vegetables to be removed 
from the area, and aerial spraying of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-month effort to eradicate West Los Angeles of a Medfly infestation 
recently ended. The effort included flooding the neighborhood with sterile 
flies in order to breed the pest out of existence. The Medfly was also 
eradicated in Northridge last winter. The cost of both efforts was $3 million, 
County Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brown Blamed for Spread 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly first came to prominence in California in 1981 when then-Gov. Edmund 
G. Brown Jr. was blamed for spreading the infestation by delaying the spraying 
of malathion. Eventually, the state spent $100 million to eradicate the pest, 
and California growers lost an additional $100 million in sales because of a 
quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins said there is no way of knowing how the fly arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"We never know," he said. "Some person had to have it sent in with fruit or 
brought in fruit with it. That individual probably doesn't even realize they 
started it. If they did, they wouldn't admit it." 
</P>
<P>
There is a $10,000 fine for bringing in fruit that triggers an infestation, but 
Atkins Tuesday could not recall any prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the first month, we should have one generation completed," 
Atkins said. "If there are no additional flies at that time, we'll feel fairly 
comfortable that was just a lonesome guy out there looking for love." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Description of Insect 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly is slightly larger than a housefly. Its eye tends to be a darkish 
blue; its thorax is a glistening black with a mosaic pattern of yellowish white 
bands. The Medfly abdomen is yellowish with two silvery cross bands; its wings 
are banded and blotched with yellow, brown and black. 
</P>
<P>
Spaugy urged residents to call his office if they find fruit fly larvae, a 
creamy white maggot, in home-grown fruit. The larvae is pointed at one end and 
blunt at the other, about one-fourth inch long. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, officials plan to announce today a quarantine in West 
Covina after the discovery last weekend of a dozen Oriental fruit flies. 
Workers are applying insecticide to fence posts, trees and utility poles in an 
effort to kill the pest.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LIFEGUARD TOWERS WILL GO COMMERCIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commercial advertisements that now appear on lifeguard trucks, phone booths and 
trash cans at Los Angeles County beaches soon will adorn lifeguard towers. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved placing ads on the bottom of 
3-by-4-foot chalkboards hung on the sides of 155 lifeguard towers. The boards 
advise the public of the times of high and low tides, sunset and temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in August, the chalkboards will carry a handprint, the logo for a 
beachwear company. The county will get $15,000 a year from the contract with 
American Marketing Works Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, supervisors decided to allow ads on beachside phone booths. About 
6,000 trash cans line county beaches, donated by a radio station. Also, 
lifeguard trucks display signs that say "Nissan, official car of the Los 
Angeles County beaches."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY JAIL ESCAPEE CAPTURED AT MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Jail escapee was captured at Fox Hills shopping mall in 
Culver City Tuesday after he was recognized by a jewelry store employee, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Williams, 28, was taken into custody shortly after noon by Culver City 
police officers, who were called to the jewelry store by a security guard, 
sheriff's deputies said. Police said Williams was carrying a knife when he was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had been awaiting trial for armed robbery when he made his weekend 
breakout from the Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles by using a rope of 
bedsheets. His escape was discovered about 7:30 a.m. Sunday by deputies who 
found a rope fashioned from bedsheets tied to a rail and dropping about three 
stories to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The jewelry store employee recognized Williams from news reports. But the 
suspect didn't realize he had been recognized, giving the employee time to call 
police, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' bail, previously set at $25,000, was revoked when he was again booked 
into County Jail on suspicion of escape.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: USC RAISES RECORD OF $102.6 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC President James H. Zumberge announced Tuesday that the university raised 
$102.6 million in cash gifts in the past year, setting a record for the Los 
Angeles school. 
</P>
<P>
The donations provided a major boost to USC's campaign to raise $557 million by 
next year. So far, more than $504.3 million has been given or promised, 
Zumberge said. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is financing several new structures that are expected to be 
dedicated this fall, including a neuroscience building, a student center and a 
law center addition. The gifts also have funded 29 chairs and professorships 
and 15 endowed research funds, as well as scholarships, officials said.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-awaited testimony of defendant Raymond Buckey in the McMartin 
Pre-School molestation trial, scheduled to begin Tuesday, was delayed by the 
illness of a juror. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders sent remaining jurors home 
after one of their members called in to report that he was in pain and taking 
pain-killers after having had a tooth extracted Monday.

Buckey, 31, who is charged with 52 counts of molestation and a shared count of

2 BRITONS GUILTY IN SCHEME TO CHEAT IRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office announced Tuesday that two British citizens had 
pleaded guilty to charges of participating in an elaborate scheme to defraud 
the Internal Revenue Service, which involved phony trades on the London Metal 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
David H. Lamb pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and Barry Hughes 
pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to defraud the IRS. The two are to be 
sentenced Sept. 18 by U.S. District Judge Terry R. Hatter. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Terree A. Bowers, the prosecutor in the case, said he 
believes it is the first time that British brokers have pleaded guilty to 
assisting American citizens in defrauding the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a landmark case; it shows we can go after foreign brokers," said 
Bowers, who directs the major fraud unit of the U.S. attorney's office in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Important Case 
</P>
<P>
Harland W. Braun, a veteran criminal defense lawyer who represented Lamb, 
agreed that it was a case of considerable importance. 
</P>
<P>
"The case established American criminal jurisdiction over British businessmen," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Hughes and Lamb were indicted in 1985 following a lengthy joint 
investigation by the IRS and the FBI, Braun and other defense lawyers asserted 
that U.S. courts had no jurisdiction over them. But last year Judge Hatter 
ruled against them. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend of the law is in favor of what the government is doing in this 
case," said Braun. "With the growth of international business," he added, there 
are likely to be more cases where foreigners are subject to U.S. criminal laws 
and U.S. citizens are subject to the criminal laws of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers said there were two schemes in the case. 
</P>
<P>
One involved the creation of false losses through trades on the commodities 
exchange in London on which there was no risk and the return of the money 
supposedly lost through corporations set up in places like the British Virgin 
Islands and the Bahamas. The second scheme involved the laundering of money on 
successful investments so that taxes would not have to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elaborate Sting 
</P>
<P>
Bowers said Hughes, 37, and Lamb, 45, were caught through the use of an 
elaborate undercover sting involving agents from the FBI and the IRS. He said 
one IRS agent posed as a taxpayer who wanted to generate bogus losses on 
commodity trades, while an FBI agent posed as the IRS agent's financial 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the FBI agent contacted an American broker, Ronald N. Kane of Canoga 
Park, and told him he had a client who needed to generate losses in a specified 
account. Soon, he and the IRS agent were put in contact with Lamb and Hughes in 
London. The agents opened a trading account in London and requested the 
creation of a trading loss of $35,000. They were advised to send an odd sum of 
money to lessen the possibility that tax officials would become suspicious.

JURY PICKED IN TRIAL OF ALLEGED DRUG KINGPIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid unusually heavy security in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, seven men 
and five women were selected Tuesday as jurors in the trial of Juan Ramon Matta 
Ballesteros, a 44-year-old Honduran accused of running a massive cocaine ring. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Pamela A. Rymer scheduled opening arguments for Thursday morning in the 
trial, expected to last a month. 
</P>
<P>
Matta, a reputed billionaire, was accused in a 1985 indictment with heading a 
cocaine trafficking organization that, in one seven-month period alone, moved 
into the United States about 1,000 kilograms of cocaine, valued at $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors Jimmy Gurule and Manuel Medrano's contention that Matta 
controlled the operation is based on ledgers that were seized at the Oakwood 
Garden apartment complex in Van Nuys on Sept. 21, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, 114 pounds of cocaine and $1.9 million in cash 
were seized. At the time, this was the largest seizure of cocaine and cash in 
California history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Indictment 
</P>
<P>
Matta also stands accused in a second federal indictment of directing a 
multimillion-dollar drug importation and distribution network headquartered in 
Colombia that was responsible for importing hundreds of kilograms of cocaine 
into the United States between 1983 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that a trial on those charges will be held later this year or 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
People seeking to enter Rymer's courtroom Tuesday had to pass through a 
specially installed metal detector, in addition to the one that all those 
entering the federal courthouse must go through. Additionally, armed deputy 
U.S. marshals have been present the last two days in anticipation of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a brown suit and a red necktie, Matta sat quietly next to an 
interpreter while jurors were being chosen by the prosecutors and his defense 
attorney, Martin Stolar of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Matta was arrested aboard a U.S.-bound plane in April, 1988, after he was 
whisked out of his native country and taken to the Dominican Republic by 
Honduran officials, who had been prodded by the U.S. government for assistance 
on the case for more than a year. The arrest precipitated several days of 
rioting and demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy in Honduras, which has 
a clause in its constitution prohibiting extradition of its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escape From U.S. Prison 
</P>
<P>
Federal marshals said the basis of its jurisdiction over Matta was a warrant 
for his escape from Eglin Federal Prison Camp in Florida in 1971, where he had 
been held on charges of entering this country on a false passport. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest came only one day after Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) had criticized 
the approach of Honduran officials to drug problems, asserting that Matta was 
living in luxury there while there were multiple charges pending against him in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
Matta had been living in Honduras for two years after escaping from a prison 
hospital in Colombia, where he was being held on drug charges. He has been 
described as one of the most important links between Colombia's Medellin cartel 
and Mexican smugglers who transport drugs into the United States.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPROMISE SET ON HISTORIC HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a five-year battle over saving historic homes in Redondo Beach, the City 
Council has decided on a compromise approach that would raise barriers to quick 
demolition but ultimately allow owners to tear down and replace such buildings. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have decided to create an eight-member Preservation Commission, 
effective Sept. 1. Under the measure, owners of buildings deemed to have 
unusual historic and architectural significance will be temporarily forestalled 
from demolishing, relocating or substantially altering their exteriors without 
the commission's approval. 
</P>
<P>
However, the protection covers only single-family homes that have been 
designated as landmarks or are in a historic district. It expires after a 
maximum of 225 days. 
</P>
<P>
The Council included in its measure other limitations, including a provision 
saying that only the owner of a building can nominate it as a landmark.

SHRIVER SINCERE -- ALMOST TO DOUBLE FAULT 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe Pam Shriver, despite towering potential, a gift from God, will never win 
a major tennis tournament. It's not incumbent she do so because there's more to 
life than applause, partaking of championship celebrations and making eloquent 
acceptance speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Shriver is far above all that. Her human qualities, especially her concern 
for others, surpass where she is in the world rankings and what happened at the 
last tour stop. 
</P>
<P>
The talented Shriver is constantly putting the accelerator to the floor, asking 
too much of herself and with this comes painful frustration. Pam Shriver, for 
the first time in what has been an exciting and exceptional career, is beating 
Pam Shriver. She needs to relax, forget about goals and be content to just keep 
the ball in play. She should minimize game plans and the development of new and 
involved techniques and rely on what brought her this far -- pure natural 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
She's losing to some opponents who ordinarily don't belong on the same court. 
Shriver drives herself in an unending mental quest that only succeeds in tying 
up the physical process of hitting a tennis shot, scoring points and putting 
away rivals. It's known as a slump. 
</P>
<P>
She can't escape the dilemma, this untold pressure that refuses to ease and 
compounds itself when she thinks about a solution. There is an answer. She must 
play her way out of the problems that have caused her to slip six notches on 
the international tennis ladder; she's now the 10th-ranked women's tennis 
player in the world. 
</P>
<P>
It seems only yesterday -- but it was more like 11 years ago -- that Shriver, 
bearing one of the illustrious names in Maryland history, was the sensation of 
Wimbledon. A real Yankee Doodle sweetheart who was literally born on the Fourth 
of July. The English were excited, enthralled and enthused about the tall girl 
from Lutherville, not much more than a soft lob out of Baltimore, who was so 
richly endowed with exceptional skills and had such verve. 
</P>
<P>
Her smile and presence were a joy to observe. She was always genuine in speech 
and manner. Refined and respectful but, again, always herself. It was said that 
one so equipped with her power and stamina would climb the highest mountains. 
She did, too. 
</P>
<P>
But now she continues onward attempting to find herself and put away this demon 
known as "unlimited potential." It's still there, but it's more important she 
relax and enjoy what's going on around her and not create such inner turmoil 
for herself. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Shriver, although playing an individual game, is never selfish or 
self-centered. She's always doing for others. One of her elementary school 
teachers is in a rest home now, but Shriver, coming off the road, or back from 
the Orient or Europe or Australia, goes to see her. The aged and infirmed are 
often put on the shelf and forgotten, but not in her perspective. 
</P>
<P>
She's always available for charitable causes, looking to give something back. 
Shriver realizes life has been good to her, and she wants to repay. Elise 
Burgin, a competitor but more importantly a friend, plays all the tournaments 
with Shriver. The personal respect they hold for each other buoys the human 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
When Burgin's mother was killed in an automobile crash this past winter, 
Shriver came rushing home to give the trophy she won to her grieving friend. 
"Pam Shriver is an incredible person," Burgin said. "If you don't know her, you 
have missed one of the great experiences of life." 
</P>
<P>
At the funeral service, Shriver was seated behind the Burgin family. When 
moments seemed more trying for Elise, there was Pam reaching over the bench in 
the synagogue to offer a comforting touch on the shoulder and a consoling word. 
She is, indeed, a remarkable woman with deep feeling and sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Driving along a highway, she'll see a motorist -- man or woman, black or white 
-- having trouble with an automobile. More frequently than can be counted, she 
stops to lend assistance or even goes so far as to personally seek help from a 
towing service or a mechanic.

TONYA MOORE, STILL IN PAIN, RECALLS MARRIAGE'S BEST DAYS

<P>
The words flowed in whispers, but her tears spoke louder. 
</P>
<P>
They rolled from the drowsy eyes of Tonya Moore as she recalled her husband, 
Donnie, the former Angel reliever who fired three bullets into her last Tuesday 
before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a lot of problems, but I still love him," Tonya Moore said from her 
hospital bed, an inch-long scar visible on her neck where she said one of the 
bullets penetrated. "He was a sweet guy." 
</P>
<P>
This was the same man who, according to relatives, she had quarreled with 
frequently in recent months. Donnie Moore, 35, had become deeply depressed 
after being cut in June by the Kansas City Royals' triple-A team in Omaha, 
according to the family's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Tonya Moore, also 35, said that she is not bitter about the shootings. In 
an interview at Kaiser Permanente's Anaheim Medical Center, Moore preferred to 
talk of the husband she remembered from happier days. 
</P>
<P>
She alluded to her husband's "problems" but would not elaborate except to say 
that he would not discuss them. Donnie Moore kept his problems to himself, she 
said. "Donnie wasn't like normal people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Moore reached the pinnacle of his 13-year major league career when he 
received a three-year, $3-million contract from the Angels in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But he was dogged by a single pitch. With the Angels one strike away from the 
1986 World Series, he gave up a home run to Dave Henderson in Game 5 of the 
American League playoffs and the Boston Red Sox went on to win the Series. 
After that, Moore's fortunes declined. 
</P>
<P>
Tonya Moore said she remembers every detail of the shooting. But this was not 
the time for such memories, she said softly. Maybe next week, but not now. 
</P>
<P>
She denied reports that the couple had had a major dispute about selling their 
1.5-acre estate in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, she said, some days have been harder than others. Sunday 
was especially difficult, since she had been unable to attend memorial services 
in Santa Ana the day before and knew she was too weak to travel to Lubbock, 
Tex., for Tuesday's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"My Donnie was leaving," she said, holding back tears. "I thought I wasn't 
going to get to see him." 
</P>
<P>
Family attorney Randall Johnson of Santa Ana said that to help her, he arranged 
to have Moore's body brought to the hospital. The body was delivered to a 
vacant room at the hospital, and Tonya Moore was wheeled from her private room. 
</P>
<P>
"I contacted the mortuary and told them Tonya was unable to come to the funeral 
services," he said, adding that at the hospital, "she was able to see him. . . 
. (Hospital workers) were kind enough to bring him into a private room." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said the viewing gave her a chance to express her love -- and 
forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I forgive him," she said, laboring with each word and in obvious 
pain from the .45-caliber bullets that had pierced her lungs, stomach and neck. 
"I told him I love him. I asked, 'Why?' " 
</P>
<P>
She strained to talk above the sounds of the equipment next to her bed. Her 
eyelids were heavy, and she dabbed them often with tissue grasped tightly in 
her left hand, particularly when she recalled her fondest memories of her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
Those remembrances were of a sportsman and family man. She said that when he 
went on an overnight fishing trip or on the road with the Angels, "he called 
once every day, (sometimes) twice a day, three times a day." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Donnie Moore's millionaire salary, Johnson said, the family now is 
having financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things are coming out of the woodwork, now that Donnie's dead," the 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, no one has contributed to a trust fund he established for the 
Moore family. 
</P>
<P>
"Zero -- I have gotten absolutely nothing," Johnson said. "I'm pretty shocked. 
I'm beginning to think people thought this guy had this $3-million contract, 
and maybe the guy doesn't need any more. I'm here to say they have financial 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Tonya Moore made no mention of family finances, preferring to speak only of 
Donnie, whom she married in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone rang several times, and she dutifully answered. The calls were 
from friends and fans alike, wishing to send condolences or cheer her up. She 
was so weak that she appeared to have trouble returning the receiver to its 
cradle. 
</P>
<P>
Others sent bouquets -- some topped with cheery balloons -- that crowded one 
side of the room. 
</P>
<P>
By evening, she was feeling a little better. 
</P>
<P>
"I have friends with me, and family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that she still didn't know when she would get out of the hospital but 
said, "All I want to do is get well, be with my kids and go on with my life."

GARRETT RAY HAS UNCANNY KNACK OF SPOTTING ELUSIVE CORBINA AT LOW TIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At dawn, with the tide so low that only a gentle sheet of water rushes up onto 
the the flat sandy coastline, a familiar sight appears over a small dune. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett Ray, having walked a short distance from his Venice Beach home, is well 
aware of what this minus tide will mean, and he has planned his day 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
With the tide this low, the white-haired fisherman will be able to see the 
"chuck holes" in the wet sand that will eventually fill with water -- and fish 
-- from the incoming tide. Prospects will be best here, he says. 
</P>
<P>
More important, however, he can witness the wary corbina, swimming in with each 
wave to feed. They are easily visible in the shallow flats created by the minus 
tide, and thus more susceptible to the careful fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Ray's arrives, and a few others are on the beach with fishing rods 
in their hands and hopes of success in their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Their chances will be greatly enhanced by the presence of Ray, 61, who has 
fished extensively for corbina for the last 50 years, and who in that time has 
fine-tuned his skills in what can be described as one of the most frustrating 
types of fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a damned good corbina fisherman, one of the best there is," said Bob 
Wylie, whose Malibu bait shop has been catering to surf fisherman for more than 
42 years. 
</P>
<P>
The corbina, an elusive croaker that is strong enough for the powerful 
inter-tidal currents in which it swims and feeds, has discouraged as many 
people by its reluctance to bite as it has excited by its sizzling runs on hook 
and line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty smart fish," Ray says. "You've got to be when you've got to get 
in here and mingle with all these swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
He points to surfers wading through the corbina's territory and alludes to the 
hordes of beach-goers that will arrive later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the conditions seem right. The tide is rising slowly and the anglers 
follow Ray a short distance up the coast. Having filled a tin can with 
soft-shelled sand crabs, as opposed to the more abundant but less-productive 
hard-shelled variety, the fishermen rig their gear and begin to cast. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, meanwhile, chooses to wait, and talk about his favorite fish. He recounts 
the day he caught 25 corbina and donated them to the local lifeguards for a 
fish fry. He recalls the six- and seven-pounders -- the largest on record 
weighed 8 1/2 pounds -- that were "pretty consistent" in the 1930s, when he 
started fishing for them. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a bigger kick out of the people fishing around me than catching them," 
he says. "Sometimes I'll leave my pole at home and bring people down and show 
them how to fish 'em." 
</P>
<P>
After all, Ray doesn't want to be selfish. He says he has caught and released 
about 300 corbina this year alone, a claim that people who know him will back. 
</P>
<P>
"He can spot the fish like nobody else," says Bill Beebe, a local columnist who 
has fished with Ray over the years. "He'll point to an area holding two or 
three fish and I'll have to really strain to see them." 
</P>
<P>
Ray's eye for corbina, which range from southern Baja California to Point 
Conception, becomes evident before long, as he begins to spot fish in the surf. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one," he shouts as he points to the swirling corbina. "Did you see 
that big ol' one over there?" 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Beebe is hooked up, his seven-foot ultra-light rod bent almost 
double. Ray doesn't get excited. "It's just a small one," he suggests. "It'll 
go 1 1/2, maybe 1 3/4 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
After about five minutes, Beebe has landed the fish, bearing out Ray's 
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
Ray and Beebe then walk farther north, Ray scouting the surf line while 
recalling the five-pounders that had come in so far to feed that he had to 
"kick them off the sand bars," or how the corbina will sometimes "stand on its 
head while digging through the sand for hard-shells (sand crabs)." 
</P>
<P>
Sand crabs represent 90% of the corbina's diet -- some insist the fish's flesh 
tastes similar to crab meat -- and Ray says that 99% of those are hard-shells, 
simply because they are abundant. Soft-shelled crabs, though more difficult to 
come by, are prized as bait. Ray, while walking, talking and scouting for fish, 
digs them up with his big toe. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he can find them when others can't, he replies, "After 50 years I 
better know how." 
</P>
<P>
He then tells how they are usually the last to bury themselves in the sand, and 
how they sometimes leave small bumps in the sand after burrowing under. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he too has hooked up and about 10 minutes later a 3 1/2-pound corbina 
lies exhausted on the beach. Ray nonchalantly picks it up and releases it in 
the surf. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later he calls to another fisherman, waves him over and points to an 
area just in front of him. The fisherman, seeing three fish in a chuck-hole not 
more than 10 yards out, casts and eventually lands a 3 1/2-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-morning, all fishing with Ray have caught a fish. Others have gathered, 
but Ray, claiming the tide has risen too far, calls it quits. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still out there," he says. "But I don't even bother when I can't see 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Nope. Ray prefers to stalk the corbina, much as one would stalk the bonefish of 
the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, with the right surf in the flats, I can walk along and show you groups 
of three fish, five fish or even seven fish," he says, pointing out what has 
already become evident. 
</P>
<P>
And when the corbina is hooked, often in ankle-deep water, it gets downright 
stubborn, darting out beyond the surf line or merely turning sideways to resist 
the angler's pressure. On four-pound test it is a challenge for even the most 
experienced angler. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more and more corbina fishermen every year," Ray says. "But they'll 
never be fished out because you're not going to find too many people that are 
going to catch them." 
</P>

U.S. SOCCER MATCH MOVED TO HONDURAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Soccer Federation learned Tuesday that the national team will play its 
World Cup qualifying match against El Salvador on Sept. 17 at Tegucigalpa, 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA, the international soccer federation, made the decision when the five 
teams in the region encompassing North and Central America and the Caribbean 
could not agree on a location for the game. 
</P>
<P>
It originally had been scheduled for San Salvador on July 9, but FIFA 
indefinitely suspended games in El Salvador because of a fan disturbance there 
on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 4-2 with eight minutes left in a game against Costa Rica, El Salvador 
was forced to forfeit when the referee determined that it would be dangerous to 
continue because of the unruly crowd. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador requested that the game against the United States be moved to Los 
Angeles, where there is a large Salvadoran population. But two other teams in 
the region, Costa Rica and Guatemala, objected to giving the U.S. an extra home 
game in the eight-game, round-robin tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Walker, USSF secretary, said the new date is the one recommended by U.S. 
Coach Bob Gansler. The United States will have a month to recuperate from two 
tournaments in early August, including the Marlboro Cup at the Coliseum Aug. 10 
and 13. 
</P>
<P>
With a 2-1-1 record, the United States is second in the qualifying tournament. 
Costa Rica completed play with a 5-2-1 record and is virtually assured of a 
berth in the 1990 World Cup tournament in Italy. The two teams with the best 
records at the end of the year advance. El Salvador is 0-2.

HOLLYWOOD NERVOUS OVER POSSIBLE EUROPEAN TV QUOTAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER , Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Italian television entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi was scouring Hollywood 
in the late 1970s in search of programs, he was neither free-spending nor 
discriminating. Had he been either, he certainly wouldn't have purchased that 
legendary piece of Reaganalia, "Death Valley Days," for $500 a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
But Berlusconi's shopping spree laid the groundwork for a generation of 
broadcasters struggling to fill the huge demand for programs created by the 
introduction of commercial television in Europe. By the mid-1980s, one of 
Berlusconi's competitors was reportedly paying $70,000 an episode for the 
Italian rights to "Dynasty." 
</P>
<P>
Today, sales of movies and television programs to European TV channels are 
worth more than $800 million annually, according to market researchers Frost 
&amp; Sullivan, a fivefold increase since 1980. In an era of network cost 
cutting, these sales represent a key source of revenue for the major Hollywood 
studios and independent producers alike. 
</P>
<P>
But some fear that this bonanza is about to end. As part of an effort to 
achieve full economic unity by 1992, the 12-nation European Community is 
considering a law that would impose quotas on American programming. And even if 
the proposal is ultimately defeated, U.S. companies will have to move 
aggressively to maintain their position in a rapidly changing market. The 
challenge of competing overseas was repeatedly cited as a key factor driving 
Time's acquisition of Warner Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Limits on U.S. programming in Europe are nothing new, but the prospect of 
European-wide quotas has jolted Hollywood lobbyists into action. "A blanket 
restriction that lies across 12 countries, that's a frightening prospect," said 
Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Assn. of America and leader of the 
anti-quota fight. "And with the single market, we don't know if this is just 
the floor. We're in uncharted territory." 
</P>
<P>
The studios, striking at a time of hypersensitivity on trade issues, have 
received a sympathetic hearing from U.S. government officials. U.S. Trade 
Representative Carla A. Hills told Congress in June that the United States has 
registered "very sharp and strong objections to local content in broadcasting" 
and that it was prepared to retaliate if the quota proposal were passed. The 
House telecommunications and finance subcommittee will look at the issue in 
hearings scheduled for this week. 
</P>
<P>
Television industry lobbyists have also been stalking Europe, buttonholing 
friendly broadcasters and hostile politicians. Although their efforts have not 
always been appreciated -- they apparently raised some hackles at the European 
Parliament in June with a high-pressure presence that was resented as too loud 
and too late -- they may have had some impact. The European Community's Council 
of Ministers failed to agree last month on even a watered-down version of the 
so-called "Television Without Borders" program, which seeks to establish 
European standards on a variety of broadcasting issues. 
</P>
<P>
The defeated draft demanded that broadcasters show a "majority" of Community 
programming "where practical." A new vote on the matter, or possibly a decision 
to split the program into several components for separate votes, is expected in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Most U.S. television executives assert that France is behind the quota drive, 
and they conjure dark images of a socialist conspiracy. "The people making 
these decisions are essentially bureaucrats and politicians influenced by 
left-leaning journalists and film makers," declared Michael Jay Solomon, 
president of Warner Bros. International Television. "The French government is 
anti-commercial television, and they're trying to inflict their opinions on the 
rest of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Spain -- which fears an influx of Latin American programs -- Italy, 
and several smaller states also favor restrictions. They claim that because 
Hollywood benefits from such huge economies of scale, the only way to support 
home-grown production -- and by extension, European culture -- is to impose 
restrictions. And that case is given further weight when new commercial 
channels roll out lineups featuring daily doses of "Kojak," "Get Smart," "Green 
Acres" and "Mr. Ed." 
</P>
<P>
Even without an EC quota, Hollywood's battle to maintain its European market 
share won't be over. That's because national quotas will remain in place, 
European audiences will continue to become more discriminating and local 
producers will become stronger. And much of the easy money in recent years has 
been generated by bidding wars that won't be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
French Revenues Down 
</P>
<P>
"When competition comes to a particular market, the tendency is to overbuy," 
noted Solomon. "Everyone is trying to make deals and paying high prices, but 
after a while they've had enough." 
</P>
<P>
Revenues from the French market, he said, are down 50% this year following last 
year's frenzied auctions. Solomon attributes a significant chunk of that 
drop-off to local programming requirements contained in the licenses of French 
broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
While quotas may not ultimately affect the amount of American television on 
European screens, they depress prices by dividing the market into local and 
imported segments. Colin Davis, president of MCA Television International, 
noted that "if a show is made in Germany, it will be worth more than a U.S. 
show, because it will qualify as (local) production." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, one of the key Hollywood responses to the quota threat will be 
to produce more programs overseas, a strategy that fits neatly with a desire to 
tap lower-cost locations. "In preparation for the 1990s, we need to be global 
producers," said Mel Harris, president of Paramount Television Group. "We need 
to have more than one primary market. We are going to attempt to do a 
television series in the United Kingdom and on the Continent, and we will be 
attempting this within the next year." 
</P>
<P>
David Evans, head of Qintex America and president-designate of United Artists, 
said the company plans to set up at least one production base in Europe, and 
possibly two -- one for television and one for movies. "Series production, by 
and large, will still be in the U.S., but long-form programming (TV movies and 
miniseries) will be finding their way to locations outside the U.S.," Evans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effects on Small Firms 
</P>
<P>
Still, the major studios have not been as aggressive as some expected in 
establishing a European presence. "It's a surprise that you don't see more 
American production companies investing in Europe," said Alastair Tempest, 
secretary general of the European Advertising Tripartite, a Brussels trade 
group. He cited the example of Studio Roma, a prestigious Madrid production 
house that was purchased by Berlusconi rather than by an American company. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Agrama, president of independent producer and distributor Harmony Gold 
(and Berlusconi's buyer in Hollywood), is deeply pessimistic about how current 
trends in Europe will affect smaller production companies. "If there are 
quotas, who gets in? The majors -- and it's killing the small producers," said 
Agrama. The large studios, he added, can use big-time films as the "locomotive" 
for television sales by packaging them with serials. 
</P>
<P>
Harmony Gold has been active as international co-producers, but Agrama said 
this was out of necessity, not choice. He cited the example of a current 
miniseries co-production called "The Confessional," in which Harmony gave up 
artistic control to British co-producer Grenada and retained only distribution 
rights because the show had to qualify under British quotas. 
</P>
<P>
"The more they need the quota rights, the more you have to give up," Agrama 
said, adding that his company would have produced the movie alone if possible. 
</P>
<P>
European producers, meanwhile, are benefiting from an infusion of government 
funds and are likely to be more formidable competitors in the future. But with 
the soaring number of channels, there should be room for all. Spain and West 
Germany are thought to be the next boom markets, and pay television may play an 
important role. 
</P>
<P>
Programs with at least the imprimatur of Hollywood, in short, will continue to 
sell in huge volumes in Europe. But the good old "Death Valley Days" are likely 
gone forever. 
</P>

<P>
ROSS CELEBRATES VICTORY BY MAKING PLANS FOR EUROPE

<P>
Once again, happiness is at Steve Ross' fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
The longtime Warner Communications chairman came to Los Angeles on the wings of 
victory and a corporate jet Monday night for a party at record producer Quincy 
Jones' house, following the Delaware court ruling that cleared the way for 
Warner's acquisition by Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
He spent Tuesday, his first full day as co-chairman and co-chief executive of 
Time Warner Inc., in meetings in a Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow, and on the 
spur of the moment granted an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting a "Batman" pin on his lapel, to honor Warner Bros.' blockbuster film 
that has grossed $190 million at the box office, the 61-year-old executive had 
every reason to exult. But he talked most about competing in Europe, and he 
urged other American industrial leaders to follow the Time-Warner example in 
merging. 
</P>
<P>
"The most exciting thing to come out of the Delaware court is that companies 
really have the right to combine . . . (and manage their businesses) for the 
long term, because without that, American companies are down the tube," Ross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven grueling weeks have passed since Paramount Communications launched its 
surprise attack on the Time-Warner deal, threatening to undo Ross' most patient 
handiwork. He had spent 2 1/2 years putting together a stock-swap merger with 
Time, which appeared certain to win shareholder approval until Paramount made 
its hostile bid for Time on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
The Paramount bid forced Time and Warner to regroup. The two companies 
abandoned the stock swap for Time's $14-billion acquisition of Warner, which 
would not require a shareholder vote. The maneuver outraged some Time 
shareholders but survived the courts, which ruled that directors have a right 
to manage corporations for long-term goals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laden With Debt 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised deal, Warner is now a 58%-owned subsidiary, with the 
remaining shares expected to be acquired in the next three or four months once 
a formula of cash, stock or debt is negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
The deal leaves Time Warner laden with debt that Ross would have preferred 
using for acquisitions, but on Tuesday he declared: "We'll just have to do it 
in different ways, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood and Wall Street wags say Ross has every reason to rejoice. His old 
Warner employment contract entitles him to a $180-million payout, and he has 
been guaranteed the chairman's title of the new company for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
But close associates insist that the deal means more than title and money to 
Ross, who built Warner into a glittering entertainment conglomerate from the 
unlikely origins of his in-laws' funeral parlor business. 
</P>
<P>
True, Ross is a product of Brooklyn who loves hobnobbing with Hollywood talent, 
but he has earned Wall Street's respect for his business acumen. Ross steered 
Warner through severe losses in the early 1980s, when the video game industry 
collapsed, and repeatedly outwitted his largest and most dissident shareholder, 
Chris-Craft Industries, in the board room. 
</P>
<P>
Ross demonstrated Tuesday that his solicitous attitude toward performers and 
producers won't change, taking pains to explain that Quincy Jones' party was 
not held in Ross' honor but was instead a surprise birthday party for Jones' 
close friend, Verna Harrah. 
</P>
<P>
And Ross was cautious about outlining any plans for Europe, where he traveled 
recently as his lawyers girded for the Delaware battle. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to warn our own competition by saying: 'This is what we're going 
to do here,' and 'This is what we're going to do here.' " 
</P>
<P>
But boosting Time Warner's overseas revenue is clearly a major objective. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bleakest Moment 
</P>
<P>
"You must be situated in Europe by 1992, because you're going to have one 
country for all intents and purposes . . . (and) because in any industry, 
there'll be a Bertelsmann," Ross said, alluding to the West German publishing 
giant and 12 countries' plan to form a single European market. 
</P>
<P>
The Time Warner deal "puts us 50% larger than Bertelsmann, which is great," 
Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
As he reflected upon the events leading up to the merger, Ross said his 
bleakest moment occurred when Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis telephoned his 
decision to make a cash bid for Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The sweetest moment was when we concluded the initial deal," Ross said, with 
some wistfulness for the stock swap that would have avoided debt. (Ever the 
diplomat, he later added both the lower and appellate court decisions, as well 
as "today, because of the exciting future of Time Warner.") 
</P>
<P>
And there were funny moments, such as Monday, when Cable News Network lost its 
audio signal just as the Delaware Supreme Court panel announced its decision. 
Ross, who was watching the televised proceeding at his New York headquarters, 
said he held his breath, waiting to see which legal team would begin hearty, 
congratulatory handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
His did.

Today is the first day of the rest of Time Warner's life, and there's work to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Time Inc. and Warner Communications have repelled Paramount 
Communications and begun to combine, they must think about melding their 
organizations, paying off debt and working out the final terms of the 
$14-billion deal. And that's before they start considering their much-bruited 
battle against such global competitors as Bertelsmann, Sony and Rupert 
Murdoch's News Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to struggle to start this company, and they'll have to struggle some 
more to get it going," said an adviser to Time and Warner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pretty Heavy Burden' 
</P>
<P>
The two companies began to realize their ambition of combining on Monday, when 
the Delaware Supreme Court rebuffed Paramount's legal effort to break up the 
deal, clearing the way for Time to take control of 58% of Warner's common 
stock. Time Warner will be the world's largest media and entertainment company, 
with about $10 billion in annual revenue. It will own such properties as Time's 
magazines, its Home Box Office pay-TV service and cable systems properties, and 
Warner's movie studio, TV programming and records operations. 
</P>
<P>
Time will make this happen by borrowing $10.35 billion in the first phase of 
the deal, and perhaps $4 billion in the second phase, to give Time Warner a 
debt load of about $14 billion. Many major U.S. companies carry more debt, "but 
that's still a pretty heavy burden," said Dennis McAlpine, analyst with the 
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
By McAlpine's calculations, if the company uses stock to pay for half of the 
second phase of its acquisition program, in 1990, its cash flow to cover 
payments on the debt will be "just about break-even." 
</P>
<P>
One of the first challenges for the Time Warner brass, then, will be in looking 
for ways to reduce debt. Wall Street believes that they probably will be forced 
to sell some pieces of the company, betting they will look for a buyer for 
Time's Scott, Foresman &amp; Co. publishing unit and Warner's stakes in such 
companies as toy maker Hasbro Inc. But will that be enough? 
</P>
<P>
McAlpine calculates that Time Warner could probably raise about $300 million 
selling the equity stakes and perhaps more than $600 million selling the 
publishing unit. But that $1 billion "doesn't look too big compared to your 
pile of debt," McAlpine says. 
</P>
<P>
He and some other analysts believe that Time Warner would then be forced to 
sell portions of its coveted cable systems, either by offering a stake in the 
operations or selling some pieces outright. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner's management also has the challenge of fusing its organizations and 
cultures, a subject that has been much discussed since the companies unveiled 
their first merger proposal last March. Some observers believe that the 
seven-week takeover battle has fostered a common feeling that will make the 
transition easier. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a friendly deal, I wouldn't expect a great clash," said Paul 
Napper, analyst with Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts still wonder about the differences between Time, the more 
buttoned-down organization, and Warner, which has been more free-wheeling in 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Others wonder, too, about how well Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross and Time 
Chairman J. Richard Munro will get along as "co-chief executives." Each is 
supposed to take charge of the properties their company brought to the 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
But some believe that such arrangements are unstable and predict Ross may try 
to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
The executives' ability to work together may soon become evident in their 
efforts to formulate the second phase of takeover financing, in which they must 
put together a $7-billion package of cash, debt or stock. The package will be 
used to buy the remainder of Warner's shares. 
</P>
<P>
Crowell, Weedon's Napper said Warner is understood to favor including more 
stock in the package, and Time more debt.

ASHTON-TATE POSTS BIG LOSS FOR QUARTER; PRESIDENT QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ashton-Tate Corp., reeling from problems with its latest personal computer 
database software, Tuesday announced both a $19.8-million quarterly loss and 
the resignation of president and chief operating officer Luther J. Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman and Chief Executive Edward M. Esber Jr. said Nussbaum had quit as a 
result of "differences in management philosophy," but he declined to elaborate. 
Esber, who brought in Nussbaum from Businessland in 1986 for his "operational 
expertise," will permanently assume the post of president. 
</P>
<P>
Nussbaum, reached at his home Tuesday night, described his departure as being 
"as amicable as a departure of this kind can be." He declined to comment on his 
differences with Esber. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate grew to be the nation's third-largest independent software vendor 
on the strength of dBase, a program for storing, sorting and managing large 
amounts of information in a personal computer. But the most recent version of 
the software, dBase IV, released last fall after several delays, contained a 
large number of bugs, or errors, and damaged the Torrance-based company's 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The financial results released Tuesday were worse than the company had 
projected; last month Ashton-Tate said it expected to lose $15 million for its 
second quarter ended June 30. The company's actual loss of $19.8 million came 
on revenue of $59.5 million, down from a profit of $11.5 million on revenue of 
$71.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Ashton-Tate's stock fell $1.75 to close 
at $14.50 Tuesday in heavy over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a reflection of the trials and tribulations of the dBase IV 
development process," said Marshall Moseley, an analyst with the market 
research firm Dataquest. Whether the company can return to profitability in the 
third quarter still depends on the release date for the revised dBase IV 
program, Esber said, and he would not predict when that would occur. 
</P>
<P>
"The highest priority is shipping a quality product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The second quarter loss was higher than expected, Esber said, because of low 
tax benefits on its losses in overseas jurisdictions, though he could not 
explain why that was not anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate has also attributed its financial difficulties to excess 
inventories, which resulted from extensive use of a now-discontinued delivery 
practice known as "channel stuffing." This involves shipping large inventories 
to distributors at a discount just before the end of a quarter in order to 
boost revenue. Nancy McSharry, an analyst at International Data Corp., said 
Ashton-Tate had four to seven months of inventory on hand, compared to an 
industry norm of 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Strategy' 
</P>
<P>
While most analysts expect a financial recovery in the short term, they were 
divided on the company's longer-term outlook. Ashton-Tate has long suffered 
from over-dependence on the dBase product, which still accounts for 75% of 
revenue, and a lack of new, internally developed software. 
</P>
<P>
IDC's McSharry said Ashton-Tate has "a good strategy." 
</P>
<P>
"They still have 45% of the market (for new shipments of PC database management 
products) and 50% of the installed base, and the next biggest vendor has 7%," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This seems like the culmination of the bad news," added Kevin Cluskey, an 
analyst with Swiss Bank Corp. "They're a good company with a very good 
franchise and a good balance sheet with no debt." 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst, however, who asked not to be identified, said: "They have 
fundamental problems that Esber inherited -- the limitations of their product, 
their misunderstanding of third parties, too many diversifications into too 
many areas." 
</P>
<P>
The analyst added that the resignation of Nussbaum was probably due to genuine 
business disagreements rather than a personality conflict, but declined to 
speculate on the nature of the dispute. A number of high-level executives have 
departed since Esber assumed the chairmanship upon the death of George Tate in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts suggested, however, that Nussbaum's resignation was linked to 
the problems with dBase IV, which was released last fall but infuriated users 
with its large numbers of bugs.

Former Trader at Drexel Barred: Former Drexel Burnham Lambert trader Carey J. 
Maultasch has been barred permanently from the securities industry for his part 
in Wall Street's biggest insider trading scandal. Maultasch, 37, once a senior 
trader under junk bond financier Michael Milken, the former chief of Drexel's 
Beverly Hills-based high-yield bond department, settled civil securities fraud 
charges in April without admitting or denying guilt. As part of the settlement, 
the Securities and Exchange Commission instituted a proceeding barring him from 
associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser or investment firm.

WIVES MAKE GAINS IN PAY BUT STILL LAG BEHIND HUSBANDS

<P>
Wives' incomes have increased nearly twice as fast as their husbands' in recent 
years, but the man is still the major breadwinner for most families, the Census 
Bureau reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1981 and 1987, the average earnings of wives jumped 23.3%, while 
husbands' incomes rose 11.8%, according to the study "Earnings of 
Married-Couple Families: 1987." 
</P>
<P>
That brought average income in 1987 to $13,245 for wives and $29,154 for 
husbands. 
</P>
<P>
"More of them (wives) are working year-round, full time, instead of part time," 
explained Census statistician Robert W. Cleveland. In past years, he said, 
women were more likely to accept part-time jobs, resulting in lower average 
income. "Also, more women are in professional and technical jobs, which tend to 
have better pay," Cleveland added. 
</P>
<P>
Still, wives lag behind their husbands in income. Those working full time at 
least 50 weeks a year averaged $18,929 in 1987, only 57% of the $33,305 earned 
by husbands who worked full time 50 weeks or more. 
</P>
<P>
Recent government statistics for all men and women, married and unmarried, 
showed women averaging 65% of men's income. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of children was reflected in the incomes of wives by age. The most 
rapid income rise from 1981 to 1987 was among wives aged 35 to 44, whose 
average jumped 31.5%, more than triple the 9.8% increase for husbands in the 
same age group. 
</P>
<P>
For all wives, those with no children averaged $14,256 in 1987, compared to 
$13,067 for women with children aged 6 to 17; $12,163 for those with children 
under 6, and $10,732 for those with children in both age groups. 
</P>
<P>
Husbands averaged $31,636 for those with children aged 6 to 17; while those 
with some under 6 and some 6 to 17 averaged $29,564. For those with children 
under 6, average income was $28,181, and it was $27,755 for husbands without 
children. 
</P>
<P>
While husbands may bring home most of the bacon for a majority of families, 
that isn't a universal situation. About 5.3 million wives earned more than 
their husbands in 1987, about 18% of the 29.1 million married couples in which 
both husband and wife had earnings, the report said.

Ex-Officers of Sea World Plan Bid: Three former Sea World executives said they 
plan to submit an offer to buy four Sea Worlds and two other amusement parks 
that were put up for sale last month by parent Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. 
Former executives Jan Schultz, Robert Hillebrecht and George Millay declined to 
say how much their offer will be, but analysts have estimated that the six 
parks plus 1,200 acres of raw land could fetch $1.4 billion to $2 billion.

Four Natwest Officials Resign: Lord Boardman, chairman of National Westminster 
Bank PLC, and three others resigned because of government criticism of 
Natwest's actions during a 1987 takeover of a U.S. company, the bank said. A 
total of six officials of Britain's largest bank have resigned since the 
government last week assailed bank executives' conduct in the unsuccessful 
$1.4-billion stock sale in Blue Arrow PLC during its takeover of Manpower Inc. 
Boardman, 70, accepted responsibility for the bank's "serious failings," 
Natwest said in a statement. Boardman was not cited by a Department of Trade 
and Industry report released last week. Also resigning were Charles Green, 58, 
and Terry Green, 55, both deputy chief executives of the bank, and John 
Plastow, 60, a general manager.

Phillips Petroleum Co. on Tuesday reported improved earnings in the second 
quarter, due in part to higher crude oil prices, while Chevron Corp. and Mobil 
Corp. both reported lower earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's earnings dropped 22.3%, in part because last year's numbers included 
an unusual gain; Mobil's dropped 22.7%, in part because this year's figures 
included a loss from the sale of assets, and Phillips' rose 15.9%. 
</P>
<P>
All companies benefited from higher crude prices and better refining margins 
during the period, though Phillips reported high costs from extensive scheduled 
maintenance on its refineries. The companies also reported lower income from 
chemical businesses, though Mobil reported an increase from the sale of its 
interest in a chemical company. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Net income for the quarter ended June 30 was $404 million, compared to $520 
million in the like period of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's second-quarter earnings included a $148-million gain mainly from 
Chevron's sale of its interest in the mineral company AMAX Inc. 
</P>
<P>
This quarter's earnings were reduced by $10 million in adjustments, including 
special items and the effects of foreign exchange. Revenue for the quarter was 
$8.2 billion, compared to $7.3 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Estimated earnings for the second quarter were $401 million, compared to $519 
million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 figure included a $140-million loss on the sale of business operations 
in South Africa. Without that loss, earnings would have increased about 4% over 
last year, due mainly to improved income from refining and marketing operations 
and lower financing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings also improved from recent acquisitions, including a refinery in 
Louisiana, the domestic oil and gas interests of Newmont Mining and a chemical 
plant in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the quarter was $14 billion, unchanged from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips Petroleum Co. 
</P>
<P>
Net income was $197 million, compared to $170 million in the like period a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings were helped by a $21-million gain from the settlement of a dispute 
involving an interstate pipeline company, Phillips reported. Revenue for the 
quarter was $3.3 billion, compared to $2.9 billion a year ago.

TIMES MIRROR PROFIT UP 7.6% IN 2ND QUARTER 
</P>

<P>
Times Mirror Co. reported Tuesday that its profit, boosted by the sale of 
timberlands and a strong performance in cable television, rose to $85 million 
in the second quarter, up 7.6% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the Los Angeles media company, which publishes The Times, Newsday, 
the Baltimore Sun and other newspapers, increased 5.3% in the quarter to $861 
million. Gains from asset sales and improvement in cable operations helped 
Times Mirror offset lower broadcasting earnings and a flat performance by its 
newspaper operations, caused largely by economic sluggishness in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for Times Mirror's newspaper operations rose 2.5% from the year-earlier 
quarter to $525 million, with operating profit for the segment declining 0.3% 
to $88 million. The company said The Times posted a strong performance in the 
quarter, although advertising volume fell at Newsday on Long Island, which has 
been hurt by a softening New York economy. 
</P>
<P>
The company's cable television business showed healthy growth for the period. 
Operating earnings jumped 57.5% to $16 million, the result of cost controls and 
an increase in cable subscribers. Revenue for the unit rose 17.7% in the 
quarter to $82 million. 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror posted a $23-million pretax gain on the sale of timberlands, 
compared to a similar $8-million gain a year earlier. Excluding those gains, 
the company's pretax income fell 3.1% in the quarter to $121 million. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcast operations were hurt by soft advertising demand, high programming 
costs and the continuing economic slump in Texas, where Times Mirror operates 
two television stations. Revenue for the segment rose 0.8% to $29 million, with 
operating profit falling 8% to $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Robert F. Erburu, Times Mirror chairman and chief executive, 
said the company's revenue growth slowed largely because of weakening in the 
Northeast economy, although the lower revenue growth was offset by cost cutting 
and lower newsprint prices. For the first six months of the year, Times 
Mirror's profit was virtually flat at $154 million, while revenue in the period 
increased 7.3% to $1.71 billion.

TASK FORCE GETS 6 FORMER BROKERS IN AREA INDICTED 
</P>

<P>
Six former Los Angeles-area securities brokers were indicted Tuesday on charges 
of bilking money from clients, unauthorized trading or other fraudulent acts. 
</P>
<P>
Although the money involved in each case is relatively small, they are 
significant in that they represent the first multiple criminal indictments 
obtained by the new Southern California Securities and Commodities Fraud Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
The interagency task force, created earlier this year along with other task 
forces nationwide by U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, targets insider trading, 
penny stock fraud and other securities abuses. To enhance the task force, the 
U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles has been given three additional attorneys 
who work full time on securities fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
The cases "represent conduct that is particularly bad," said U.S. Atty. Gary A. 
Feess. "They (the brokers) abused their positions of trust and confidence to 
enrich themselves." The defendants, who operated independently, are: 
</P>
<P>
* Peter M. Parrott, 40, of Los Angeles, a former E. F. Hutton broker, charged 
with bilking two clients out of about $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Arnold D. Hornsby, 37, of Inglewood, a former E. F. Hutton broker, charged 
with diverting about $151,000 from a client. 
</P>
<P>
* James Nishinaka, 31, of Van Nuys, charged with bilking clients out of about 
$41,000 of their life savings while falsely posing as a Shearson Lehman broker. 
</P>
<P>
* David O. Naulin, 32, of Huntington Beach, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert and 
E. F. Hutton broker, charged with falsely posing as a broker at Diehl &amp; Co. 
and squandering about $150,000 from a client through unauthorized trading in 
index options. 
</P>
<P>
* Carlos Medina-Valenzuela, 37, of Covina, a former marketing representative at 
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., charged with diverting about $20,000 
from at least 10 clients. 
</P>
<P>
* Kai Sum Tam, 37, of Ontario, a former representative at New York Life 
Securities, charged with diverting about $62,124 in client funds. Reached by 
phone, he said he would turn himself in and not contest the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The other defendants could not be reached for comment.

Tokyo stock prices soared to a record close for the first time in eight weeks 
Tuesday as market jitters were exorcised by Sunday's election loss for the 
ruling party and Prime Minister Sosuke Uno's decision to resign. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei index soared 445.57, or 1.31%, to a record close of 
34,538.90 after hitting an intra-day high of 34,542.51 just before trading 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
The index rose 193.90 Monday after Uno's statement. Its previous closing peak 
of 34,266.75 has been unchallenged since May 31. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday's election was a catharsis for the market, and it's been up and running 
ever since," said Paul Migliorato, equity salesman for Jardine Fleming 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in parliament's upper 
house for the first time in 34 years Sunday, and the next day Uno announced his 
plan to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Investors had been nervous over the outcome of the elections and the fate of 
scandal-scarred Uno, but events on Sunday and Monday erased their 
uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange, stocks closed higher, reflecting takeover 
speculation and Wall Street's strong opening. The Financial Times 100-share 
index ended up 10.3 at 2,269.4.

CAFFEY GO-GO'S BACK TO AN ALL-GIRL GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Charlotte Caffey left the Go-Go's in 1985, she vowed that she would never 
be part of another all-girl band. 
</P>
<P>
So who's heading the Graces, the new all-women band whose debut album, "Perfect 
View," comes out next week? That's right: Caffey. 
</P>
<P>
"So maybe I'm a glutton for punishment," quipped the singer-guitarist, whose 
new partners are singer Gia Ciambotti and singer-guitarist Meredith Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
For Caffey, memories of the Go-Go's hadn't been all sweet until two weeks ago, 
when the five former Go-Go's -- Caffey, Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin, Gina 
Schock and Kathy Valentine -- got together for the first time as a unit since 
the 1985 split. 
</P>
<P>
Carlisle and Schock organized the reunion at an Italian restaurant on Melrose 
Avenue. And, Caffey reported, it was joyous. 
</P>
<P>
"We were like a bunch of sailors getting together after years of being apart. 
Getting together was like officially closing a chapter on something -- but we 
all had to get together to close the chapter. We remembered the good times. 
That day even the bad times we'd gone through didn't seem so bad." 
</P>
<P>
Caffey said that they even discussed the possibility of reuniting for benefit 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
Carlisle, a pop/dance-music star on MCA Records, is the most famous of the 
ex-Go-Go's. Wiedlin has had some success on EMI Records, but Schock was 
recently dropped by Capitol Records. 
</P>
<P>
Since the split, various members had stayed in contact with each other. 
Carlisle and Caffey, for instance, remained friends. In fact, Caffey worked on 
Carlisle's two solo albums. 
</P>
<P>
Those two also engineered the breakup. 
</P>
<P>
The Go-Go's career was slipping by 1985. The group was signed by I.R.S. Records 
in 1981, several years after it was formed by Wiedlin and Carlisle. 
</P>
<P>
"We struggled for years before we got that record deal," Caffey said. "It was 
tough because we were girls. People were slamming doors in our faces for years. 
It was incredibly satisfying to have a hit on our first try." 
</P>
<P>
The debut album sold more than 2 million copies, but sales slipped on the next 
two. The final Go-Go's album, "Talk Show," didn't even go gold (sales of 
500,000). 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of problems with each other and we just weren't getting along," 
Caffey said. "One of the problems we had was trying to live up to this bubbly 
image. All the music was supposed to be bubbly. That's what people expected 
from us. But that was very limiting. We were caught in this trap. 
</P>
<P>
"There were incredible internal problems. It got very ugly. That's why we 
stayed away from each other for so long. Those wounds needed a long time to 
heal." 
</P>
<P>
It's noteworthy that the Graces even have a contract, considering that record 
companies usually avoid signing all-women bands. The excuses haven't changed. 
They range from "females can't rock as well as men" to "female fans would 
rather see male groups." 
</P>
<P>
Once out of the Go-Go's, the last thing on Caffey's mind was facing the hassles 
of an all-female unit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared of working with women again," said Caffey, 35, in an office at 
the Hollywood headquarters of A&amp;M Records, her new label. "I didn't want to 
face the problems women bands have to go through. Things are a lot better for 
women bands now. The Go-Go's success helped make things better. But I had a 
block against working with females." 
</P>
<P>
Since she had rejected the idea of working in a women's band, Caffey decided to 
front a male group. Producer Jimmy Iovine, best known for his work with U2, 
took her demo tape to A&amp;M Records, which signed her in 1987. But it turned 
out that singing with a male band wasn't the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't feel right," Caffey said. "Being in a band with guys didn't feel 
like what I should be doing. Lead singing didn't feel right in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
Working solo, she said, didn't feel right either. Another all-women band seemed 
to be the only answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody at the record company had a problem with it," she said. "By then I was 
past my block about working in an all-women band. It seemed like the right 
thing to do then." 
</P>
<P>
While searching for male musicians, she had seen Brooks and Ciambotti in their 
own bands. "I didn't know them and they didn't know each other but I called 
them to ask about the possibility of forming a band," Caffey said. "Since I had 
seen them work in clubs, the bands they were in had broken up. They were 
looking for something to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Graces even had a woman co-producer, Ellen Shipley, in the studio, though 
executive producer Iovine was still in charge of the project. While writing 
with Ciambotti, 27, and Brooks, 31, Caffey wanted to do more of a rock album 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
"The Go-Go's were a frothy pop band," Caffey said. "I wanted to do music that 
had a harder edge. I wanted to do harmonies that had a harder edge. The Go-Go's 
harmonies were homogenized." 
</P>
<P>
No one could ever accuse Caffey of blowing her own horn. In assessing her 
talents, she is surprisingly self-critical: 
</P>
<P>
"In this group we each sing leads, but vocally I have a very limited range. I 
wanted to be with people who could really sing. I can't carry that burden 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
She isn't any more positive about her guitar skills: "I've never been a great 
lead guitar player. I play one style and that's it. Meredith plays much better 
than me. I play a few leads on the album but she plays the majority of them." 
</P>
<P>
Caffey, a Los Angeles native, started playing the guitar by default. Back in 
the mid '70s, she played bass in local bands before joining in the Go-Go's in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked me to play lead guitar," she said. "There was only one slot open in 
the band. I had never played lead guitar but I did it because I wanted to be in 
the band."

ROUGH WEATHER IN JAPAN;

<P>
MOVIE 'BLACK RAIN' RUNS AFOUL OF NATION'S CUSTOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY JENEL SMITH and VIBEKE LAROI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Late one afternoon during the production of "Black Rain," film director Ridley 
Scott and his 180-member crew were rushing to get in the last two scheduled 
shots of the day in a steel mill in Osaka, Japan, when two observers from the 
steel company began yelling at them to stop. 
</P>
<P>
The crew was running 15 minutes behind schedule, according to production 
manager Bill Watkins, and about to overshoot the approaching 5 o'clock 
deadline. As Watkins and others began to stall for time, one of the two 
Japanese mill reps walked over to the camera and put his hand over the lens. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the day's shooting at an abrupt end, but the "Black Rain" 
production company was faced with the possible forfeiture of the $40,000 
deposit the mill had required to assure that its restrictions would not be 
violated. In Japan, unlike in the United States and other Western countries 
where film crews routinely work overtime, strict shooting schedules are 
observed to the minute. 
</P>
<P>
The "Black Rain" company did get its $40,000 back, said Watkins, but the mill 
sequence had to be completed later at a plant back home in Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was just one of many that "Black Rain" principals say placed them 
at odds with their Japanese hosts and left feelings bruised on both sides of 
the Pacific. Whether the "Black Rain" experience in Japan stands as a triumph 
over tough odds, or as a matter of arrogant Western movie makers trying to 
impose their methods upon the Japanese, depends upon who is telling the story. 
</P>
<P>
Ridley Scott, reached Tuesday at his home in London, acknowledged the problems 
in Japan but said he didn't blame the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"I found the Japanese to be tremendously hardworking, although their logic at 
first seemed pedantic," Scott said. "Ultimately, it was very sensible and 
honorable." 
</P>
<P>
When the film company first arrived in Osaka last fall, it was apparently 
expecting the kind of welcome Hollywood productions receive elsewhere when they 
show up to fuel the local economy. But the welcome mat never came out. 
</P>
<P>
"Their attitude is, 'We're not interested in having an American production 
here. . . . We couldn't care less,' " said "Black Rain" co-producer Sherry 
Lansing. " 'You want to come here and make this movie? Fine. You'll do it our 
way with our rules. You'll start at this time, you'll finish at this time. And, 
yes, we do put the hand in front of the lens if you're a minute over.' 
</P>
<P>
"Once you get that, you're all right," Lansing said. "And we got it. I learned 
to ask for three days (on a location) if I thought I needed one." 
</P>
<P>
"Black Rain," a reportedly $30-million Paramount film scheduled for release in 
September, stars Michael Douglas as a New York City police detective who 
becomes ensnarled in a case involving the Japanese mafia. Japanese star Ken 
Takakura plays his Osaka police force counterpart and the man with whom he 
experiences culture clash on a personal level. 
</P>
<P>
"What we all found was that we all began to feel like Nick Conklin, Michael 
Douglas' character in the movie," said Lansing. "Nick Conklin gets involved 
with the different ways the Japanese do business as compared to us. You go 
through a lot of bureaucracy, a lot of administrative detail. There is a lot of 
bowing. Everything is very slow. . . . They're a closed society and suspicious 
of outsiders. . . . All of this is what causes the Nick Conklin character to 
become so frustrated and angry. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stunned," she said, "not by the accuracy of our script, but by the 
fact we found ourselves living the script." 
</P>
<P>
Shigenobu Suzuki, an Osaka city official who worked with the "Black Rain" crew, 
said the production problems were the result of cultural misunderstandings on 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"Formalities are complicated in Japan," Suzuki said. "Film makers here write up 
their schedules down to the hour and even minute. But Paramount's schedule was 
loose, formed more according to the surroundings that fit their artistic 
considerations." 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki said the film company didn't get a lot of local cooperation, especially 
from the police. 
</P>
<P>
"The police were perhaps the most difficult to deal with because they are the 
ones with responsibility for crowd control and there are always flocks of 
people wherever there is a film crew," Suzuki said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Richie, a historian on Japanese film who lives in Japan, declined to 
discuss the specific problems with "Black Rain," but said film companies often 
make assumptions about shooting in Japan that don't pan out when they get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"If you went to America to make a film you would go knowing the language," 
Richie said, "but yet people have come to Japan from all over who don't know a 
word of Japanese. . . . Here you are supposed to get permission ahead of time. 
A lot of foreigners who come here don't have huge plans and meet with 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese members of the "Black Rain" crew also say the Americans brought on 
many of their own problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Americans were more willing to adapt, it would have been easier," said 
one of the Japanese crew members, in an interview in Tokyo. "If they had 
studied the Japanese situation instead of just saying, 'This is how we are 
going to do it,' it would have been better." 
</P>
<P>
Among the many problems that arose on the Japanese locations of "Black Rain": 
</P>
<P>
 -- Japanese officials, honoring a countrywide restriction on firearms, refused 
to allow in the automatic weapons and handguns needed to fire blanks in action 
sequences (eventually a mix of real weapons and flame-spitting Japanese fakes 
was used). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because of narrow streets and tight corners, equipment trucks were about 
half the size of those used in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Before leaving Japan -- a month earlier than originally planned -- the film 
company was aggressively hustled out of a pachinko parlor after running over 
its filming deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There were verbal confrontations with police over breaches of official 
restrictions on just how the film crew was supposed to shoot in the city's 
spectacular Dotonburi nightclub district. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Obtaining filming permits required long, arduous negotiating sessions. 
Every location site represented a series of formal meetings that included 
ceremonial protocol such as exchanging gifts and drinking tea. Often, 
negotiations went on for weeks, only to end up with the permits denied. 
</P>
<P>
Poul said that American and Japanese productions have been filmed in the 
Japanese countryside in recent years, but in "a controlled, outdoor 
environment." But nothing with the scale and urban setting of "Black Rain" had 
been attempted in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were in Osaka, we were constantly trying to get permission to do 
things no Japanese film crew had ever gotten permission to do." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, there was talk of shooting the urban scenes for "Black Rain" in 
Hong Kong, a city that has frequently been used for large productions. David 
Salven, the film's production manager until a heart attack sidelined him in 
Tokyo, said co-producer Stanley Jaffee and some of the others felt it was 
essential for the film's authenticity to shoot in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more concerned with the physical side of it," Salven said. "Obviously, 
it would have been easier to do it in Hong Kong. They're more geared to a 
motion picture company shooting there." 
</P>
<P>
Solving the myriad details was also expensive, Watkins said . 
</P>
<P>
"We estimated a day of shooting in Japan at $145,000. By comparison, when I was 
doing 'Coming to America,' we estimated about $125,000 a day in New York and 
$85,000 in Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Explanations for the company's early departure from Japan differ. Lansing said 
the decision to return to California was made even before they got to Japan, 
because "We found it was more cost efficient to shoot interiors in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Others said the company got out as soon as they could and that by returning to 
the United States three weeks early, the entire U.S. schedule was thrown off. 
Because they left Japan early, "Black Rain" sources said, deals had to be 
renegotiated with several Japanese actors who had to obtain visas and complete 
their roles in America. 
</P>
<P>
According to casting director Diane Crittenden, American look-alikes were 
"matched" with some Japanese bit players, but that only worked in instances 
where the originals were shown at a distance, or "where they could be cut in 
and out." Other Japanese players were simply excised from the movie. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, props and vehicles established on film during the Japan location 
had to be duplicated or transported to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the production team found itself facing red tape, American style. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, two Japanese propane-fueled cars were needed for sequences to be 
shot in California. Paramount's legal department had to jump into the fray 
before the automobiles -- which didn't meet U.S. safety standards -- could be 
imported. Even then, the company had to promise to have both vehicles crushed 
immediately after shooting was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the matter of matching locations, "a truly hideous task" in the 
words of production manager Salven, who briefly returned to the film at the 
beginning of California location. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the company's hurried departure from the Osaka steel mill, for example, 
additional bits of footage had to be shot locally. That meant several days of 
shooting at the California Steel Industries mill in Fontana. In other 
instances, entire Japanese sets had to be created. 
</P>
<P>
The "Black Rain" team managed to convert a construction area downtown at Hope 
Street into an Osaka street. A nightclub was re-created -- interior and 
exterior -- on the Paramount lot. A Los Feliz neighborhood was shot as a 
Japanese suburb. Los Angeles International Airport subbed for Osaka Airport. 
The monastery in which Yakuza members will be seen meeting in the film was 
actually located at the Chandon vineyard in Napa -- at an additional cost, 
sources said, of $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, director Scott said that for him, shooting "Black Rain" 
in Japan was not a bad experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with the Japanese was difficult initially because of obvious language 
and cultural differences," he said. "Overall, I understood and respected the 
Japanese message."

EGYPT'S MINISTER OF CULTURE KEEPS EYE ON THE PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"For most foreigners, Egypt's culture is in the past. For us, Egypt is not of 
the past, it is the future," said Farouk Hosni, Egypt's minister of culture, in 
an interview over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's past is unrivaled and unparalleled. In the present it has many rivals 
and many cultures surpass it, but Egypt also aspires to have a strong presence 
in the contemporary world." 
</P>
<P>
People who don't know Egypt well are surprised to learn about the vitality of 
its contemporary arts, he said. "We are trying to find the means to express 
this richness." Following in the footsteps of writer Andre Malraux in France 
and actress Melina Mercouri in Greece, Hosni, a painter, is among the rare 
breed of artists who serve their countries as high-level administrators. On his 
first visit to the United States -- a 12-day jaunt that includes Dallas, New 
York and Washington -- Hosni was a guest of the Getty Conservation Institute 
for four days in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an artist doesn't just mean that you create things but that you are a 
person of vision and imagination," said Hosni, speaking through a translator in 
his hotel room in Marina del Rey. The difficulty for artist-administrators is 
that they are inclined to be "idealistic perfectionists," he said, but they 
also have an advantage: an ability to dream. "The problem is not the artist's 
visionary point of view but the means -- the material tools -- to carry out his 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
A dashing figure who might be mistaken for a film star, Hosni said his 
childhood dreams were formed by Hollywood movies. While his visit to Los 
Angeles returned him to "the old days of American cinema" (in part through a 
tour of Universal Studios), his official purpose was to shape Egypt's cultural 
future. To that end, his itinerary was packed with meetings with museum 
administrators, ceremonial meals, visits to local cultural institutions -- the 
J. Paul Getty Museum, the Getty Conservation Institute, the Museum of 
Contemporary Art -- and a conference on "The First Egyptians: Pyramid Age and 
Before" at the Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt's writers, composers and plastic artists are the strength of the 
country's contemporary culture, Hosni said. The formerly vital Egyptian film 
industry, whose products have been widely distributed in the Arab world, has 
declined for reasons not unique to Egypt: the rise of video and an increasing 
emphasis on making movies for profit, he said. Movie theaters have closed 
because Egyptians watch movies at home. "Every home has a VCR, if not two or 
three," Hosni said, and most of them show imported movies. Asked if a Muslim 
fundamentalist movement had also crippled the film industry, Hosni said that 
"at a certain point, about two or three years ago, it was a menace to the 
arts," but that threat has now "collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
Hosni said his primary challenge in promoting the arts is to find ways to put 
them on a sound economic footing and even turn them into money-making ventures. 
"The arts can be a real source of income by attracting tourism," he said, 
insisting that spotlighting the arts is also a way of raising quality. "If the 
quality is good, the art is wanted." He calls the concept "the 
industrialization of culture" and noted that other countries have found culture 
to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to show the civilized face of Egypt" to tourists, said Hosni, who 
wants that face to include more than spectacular monuments. He envisions -- and 
has already begun to work on -- performing and visual arts centers located at 
archeological sites. Contemporary artists' work would be cast in the impressive 
light of history, while "forlorn and forgotten" archeological sites would come 
to life again as venues for arts exhibitions, performances and other programs. 
Hosni plans to hit "every target. Any building or site that has its own 
character can be turned into a cultural center." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even the most forward-looking minister of culture cannot forget the 
past. The needs of Egypt's disintegrating monuments are enormous -- and these 
ancient treasures demand foreign expertise and resources. The Getty 
Conservation Institute has come to the rescue of the 3,500-year-old tomb of 
Queen Nefertari, across the Nile River from Luxor in southern Egypt. An 
international team headed by Italians is salvaging wall paintings that were 
gravely endangered by water and salts. The tomb, which has been closed since 
the early '50s, will reopen to tourists in 1991, Hosni said. 
</P>
<P>
Such success stories are tempered by the fact that Egypt has about 10,000 
archeological sites that are deteriorating at an ever-increasing rate. Urban 
encroachment, pollutants, changing water tables and tourism are all taking 
their toll. Conservation of the Giza Plateau, including pyramids and the 
Sphinx, is a $50-million job, according to Hosni. But the project is 
"completely feasible," he said. Saving "the world's first Surrealist statue" is 
"no problem," Hosni said with visionary optimism. "All we need is material and 
scientific resources."

METHENY REAPS SUCCESS WITH A NO-COMPROMISE ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Call Pat Metheny a skeptic. With a decade's worth of achievements in hand, 
ranging from Grammy Awards and poll-winning performances in Down Beat, Cash 
Box, Playboy and Record World magazines to a string of chart-busting 
recordings, he still can't quite believe it's all happening. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it really interesting," said the guitarist-composer last weekend in a 
phone call from a tour stop in Santa Fe, N.M., "to hear my name mentioned in 
very commercial company -- some of it not all that attractive to me. I mean, my 
musical references are Herbie Hancock's sextet in the late '60s, Wes Montgomery 
playing with Wynton Kelly and Jim Hall -- any time -- and Sonny Rollins and 
'Trane. 
</P>
<P>
"So, when I sometimes hear our record played on the radio right after Kenny G's 
record, I have mixed reactions like, 'Gee, I'm glad they're playing our 
record,' contrasted with, 'Gosh, what did I do wrong?!' " 
</P>
<P>
Hardly anything, if his recent activities are any indication. In the last year 
or so, Metheny, 35, has composed a dance piece for Les Ballet Jazz de Montreal, 
scored the music for an "American Playhouse" TV production, completed an 
11-month world tour, which included 13 shows in the Soviet Union, premiered a 
composition written for him by Steve Reich and released a new Geffen Records 
album, "Letter From Home." So much for comparisons with Kenny G. 
</P>
<P>
Metheny, who performs with his group at the Wiltern Theatre tonight through 
Saturday, has his own thoughts about the reasons behind his success. "I guess 
the melodic nature of what I play helps," he theorized. "I like melodies and 
they're a basic part of my style. And I think my choice of the guitar as an 
instrument plays a part, too. It's so much the symbol of our generation. We've 
all grown up hearing it. 
</P>
<P>
"But the bottom line is that I've been at this for a long time. I've traveled a 
lot and built up a kind of grass-roots thing. I've been lucky that the people 
who've become fans seem to stick around for a while, hopefully because there's 
something about the music they like." He makes it clear, however, that he has 
does not intend to compromise his musical values for the sake of commercial 
success. Metheny's pieces -- the new album provides a number of good examples 
-- are filled with shifting meters, sensuous Brazilian percussive accents and 
soaring improvisations: not exactly the stuff of everyday fusion jazz. His 
rigorously creative outlook recalls the everything-for-the-sake-of-the-music 
attitudes of the jazz players of a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said, "I want to be able to play hip notes. I want to play with a 
good feel. I want to be able to get in there with the rhythm section and churn 
things around. And I see no reason for that kind of aesthetic level not to be 
achieved in the contemporary stylistic groove that I happen to use. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I know it doesn't make sense for me to go back and play Wes Montgomery 
tunes, much as I love them. Things are different now. I've got a Synclavier; 
I've got all these other technical resources. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 1989, it's not 1969. The scene today is not as musically hip as it was 20 
years ago, and I can't put my head in the sand and pretend things aren't 
different. But on the other hand, I can't forget all the things that don't 
change -- all the things that I know are true about music, no matter what the 
style or the time." 
</P>
<P>
Metheny's program this evening will feature the same group heard on "Letter 
From Home": keyboardist Lyle Mays, drummer Paul Wertico, bassist Steve Rodby, 
percussionist Armando Marcal and all-purpose instrumentalist-vocalist Pedro 
Aznar. The continuity in the band has been remarkable. Metheny and Mays have 
been working together for 12 years; Wertico and Rodby have been with the them 
for more than seven years, and the other players for at least three. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many other aspects of the Metheny career, his band's longevity has 
evolved out of a determination to keep the music in the forefront. "Look," he 
said, "I'm not real goal-oriented in the sense that I want to sell X number of 
records, and so forth. To me, this whole business of going around and playing 
tours and being moderately successful is still sort of amazing, because I never 
really planned on it. Especially because I haven't really changed anything in 
order to get a big audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I play real hard. The whole band does. There's a lot of energy in the music, 
and I like to get it out to people. I'm not an introverted player. When I play 
I really want to play. I don't hold back." 
</P>
<P>
"In one sense, I guess I've always been kind of backward. For some performers, 
the purpose of a gig is to get people to buy the record. To me, the recording 
is a way to get people to come to the gig. . . . Because when it comes right 
down to it, getting up there and playing is what it's all about."

INMATE CREW FINDS UNIDENTIFIED BODY

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Jail inmates picking up roadside trash in an unincorporated area 
near Irvine Lake on Tuesday discovered a body covered with plywood and rocks, 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The badly decomposed condition of the body made immediate identification 
impossible, deputies said. No cause of death was established and an 
investigation was under way. Officers speculated that the victim had been dead 
about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates found the body on an embankment on Santiago Canyon Road about a 
mile south of Irvine Lake, deputies said.

PEOPLE /HERBERT J. VIDA: LA HABRA HISTORIAN TAKES PLEASURE IN TALES AND RELICS 
OF PIONEERING PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Esther Cramer, 62, remembers listening to her mother talk about milking the 
cows before walking to school, sometimes through the snow, in Highland, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
And she recalls her parents taking her to meetings of the La Habra Old Settlers 
Historical Society, where the older folks in the community would recount their 
lives as La Habra pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved to listen to them," said Cramer, a La Habra historian who helped 
resurrect the society in 1960 and now is among many members who keep it going. 
"There's good information from the past, and we're eager to make sure it's 
preserved for the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
One of the examples of yesteryear is the society's caboose, which is parked 
next to the La Habra Children's Museum. It is packed with items from the past, 
and its exhibit is changed four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the prized items are Indian artifacts, tools, kitchen gadgets, toys and 
pictures of pioneer life. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to show children how things used to be," said Cramer. "I'm sure they 
can't get the feel of life at that time, but nevertheless it provides the 
thought process about such things as getting up at 3 a.m. and walking through 
the snow to school. Things like that give pause about how things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way in the world I would let a 5-year-old travel that way today," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent exhibit by members was their early-day, home-made toys, such as 
blocks, dolls, teddy bears, kaleidoscopes, carts, blackboards and a 
spring-loaded racing car made for $4 in 1916. The car still works. 
</P>
<P>
Cramer noted that children from an earlier day had to be more imaginative than 
their counterparts of today. Youths of past generations were lucky to get one 
toy at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"I have grandchildren, and they enjoy seeing things that used to be," said 
Cramer, who retired recently from the Alpha Beta Co. as a vice president, 
director of consumer affairs and company historian. 
</P>
<P>
She added, however, that not all children have the same interest in things of 
the past. "Some are very interested and have brilliant minds, and some children 
couldn't care less." But she said a rich family history is meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's what roots are all about. We try to establish some sort of 
continuity from the way things used to be to the way things are now," said 
Cramer, who once headed the girls' physical education program in the Fullerton 
Elementary School District. 
</P>
<P>
One of her own roots still stands in her La Habra home. 
</P>
<P>
"The first recollection of my own youth is a wicker rocker, which we rescued 
from a fire that burned down our house," she said. "We later made it into a 
chair, and it's a prized remembrance for me." 
</P>
<P>
She has a picture of herself sitting in the rocker in her front yard when she 
was 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a fond memory," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Don't talk to Dorothy Titus, 62, about the fuss generated by the Supreme 
Court's decision about burning the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
"I get so irate," said the San Juan Capistrano woman who flies the American 
flag on a 24-foot pole in front of her mobile home. "No one should burn Old 
Glory." 
</P>
<P>
But just to make things right for herself, she sometimes flies a flag that says 
"Hi" and another that has playing cards on it for when she plays bridge. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she flies a different 3-by-5-foot, homemade flag each month. 
</P>
<P>
The flag lineup includes: 
</P>
<P>
January -- Top hat, champagne glass and horn for New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
February -- Three white Valentines on a red background for Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
March -- Green shamrock for St. Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
April -- Three eggs on a yellow background for Easter. 
</P>
<P>
May -- Pink and white "I Love Mom" for Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
June -- A red "I Love Dad" on blue for Father's Day. 
</P>
<P>
July -- Old Glory. 
</P>
<P>
August -- Family birthday flag. 
</P>
<P>
September -- "There's not much, so we fly the American flag." 
</P>
<P>
October -- Witch on an orange background for Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
November -- Turkey for Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
December -- Green tree on red background for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Titus is making a flag to represent the Detroit Tigers, since she's from 
Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, are they a lousy team this year," she moaned. "In fact, they're terrible. 
Nevertheless, it's our home team." 
</P>
<P>
But it was different in January, when she flew Michigan's state flag throughout 
most of the month. Michigan beat USC, 22-14, in the Rose Bowl.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN FOUND GUILTY OF KILLING HIS 
ROOMMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court jury on Tuesday found a Fountain Valley man guilty of 
second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of his roommate. 
</P>
<P>
But Curtis Timothy DeWitt, 36, will not be sentenced for second-degree murder 
until Judge John Smith can determine whether he was sane at the time of the 
Sept. 27, 1988, shooting that left Hans Willi Tonert, 55, dead of a .22-caliber 
bullet wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Tonert was pronounced dead in the front yard of his Fountain Valley house in 
the 9800 block of Petunia Avenue. DeWitt was standing next to the body when 
police arrived at the scene, according to testimony during the trial in Santa 
Ana.

DEUKMEJIAN PICKS GRAY FOR SUPERIOR COURT POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday named an Orange County Municipal Court judge 
to the county Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Judge James P. Gray of Santa Ana, the son of a federal court judge, replaces 
Judge James K. Turner, who retired. The governor appointed Gray, 44, to the 
Municipal Court in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who will make $89,851 in his new job, was an associate with the Newport 
Beach law firm Wyman, Bautzer, Rothmond, Kuchel &amp; Silbert from 1979-83. 
Before that, he was an assistant U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Gray was a lieutenant in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the U.S. Navy 
from 1972-75. He received his bachelor's degree from UCLA in 1966 and his law 
degree from USC five years later.

CHEMICAL SCARE BRINGS EVACUATION IN SAN JUAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The discovery of a potentially explosive drum of chemicals led to the 
evacuation of more than 100 workers from an industrial street in south San Juan 
Capistrano on Tuesday before the danger was removed four hours later without 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The scare took place at 32961 Calle Perfecto, a building used by Nichols 
Institute, a medical research organization. A 50-gallon drum of waste chemicals 
used for developing photographs of materials under microscopes was discovered 
swollen at the top Tuesday about 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 Nichols Institute employees and about 10 employees from the White Cap 
Wholesale Contractor Supplies building next door were evacuated, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another 150 employees of the Capistrano Unified School District's headquarters, 
directly across Calle Perfecto from the Nichols Institute, were warned to stay 
inside and keep windows closed, but they were not evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department team sealed off the building, blocked traffic from entering 
the street and finally removed a plug in the chemical barrel at 3 p.m., after 
four hours. The drum was then declared safe for normal removal by 
state-approved chemical-waste contractors used by Nichols Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Nichols, president of the research institute, said the drum of chemicals 
was found "expanding at the top. We knew there was some potential for risk, and 
we notified the Fire Department. We did this to make sure the people who 
defused it (the chemical waste) are experts." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said the drum contained two chemicals used for developing photographs 
of genetic material as seen under a microscope: glacial acetic acid and 
methanol, a flammable, poisonous liquid. 
</P>
<P>
County firefighter Jim Forrester said, "The contents of the drum consisted of 
75% methanol and 25% acetic acid." 
</P>
<P>
His team, he added, finally decided that it was safe to cover the drum with 
plastic bags and to remove the plug at the top of the barrel, relieving 
pressure inside. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the fire team considered calling the county Sheriff's Department 
bomb squad to transport the drum away from the building, Forrester said. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano police herded traffic around the industrial area, near the 
intersection of Camino Capistrano and Avenida Aeropuerto. Calle Perfecto was 
closed to traffic for about four hours. 
</P>
<P>
At the school headquarters at 32972 Calle Perfecto, employees watched anxiously 
from doors and windows as yellow-suited firefighters surrounded the evacuated 
Nichols Institute. Jacqueline Cerra, community relations officer for the 
district, said firefighters had told employees that they did not have to 
evacuate but should remain inside with doors and windows closed. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols and firefighters said they do not know why the drum of waste chemicals 
expanded and appeared on the verge of exploding. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said the two photo-developing chemicals have routinely been disposed of 
for years in similar drums with no problems. 
</P>
<P>
The institute, which has about 600 employees in San Juan Capistrano, provides 
medical diagnostic tests and research for about 4,500 hospitals across the 
nation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've been doing in this particular laboratory was studying chromosomes 
under the microscope and taking photographs of them," Nichols said. "These 
(chromosomes) are genetic material that determine certain illnesses early in 
life. The chemicals we use for developing our photographs are similar to those 
you'd find in most photography laboratories."

GUNMAN ROBS ANOTHER ROBINSON'S STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An armed robber stole about $5,000 in cash from the customer service department 
of the J.W. Robinson Co. department store in the Westminster Mall about 7 p.m. 
Tuesday, then sped away in a rust-colored car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster police said the bandit waved a pistol before fleeing with the cash, 
but no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
It was at least the second robbery at a Robinson's store in Orange County in 
recent weeks. On July 10, a gunman took between $17,000 and $25,000 in cash 
from the Costa Mesa store, firing his gun accidently as he fled, Costa Mesa 
police said.

EX-COUNTY JAIL FUGITIVE CHARGED WITH MURDER IN JEWELER'S HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BURBANK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three men, including an alleged master jewel thief who planned a daring Orange 
County jailbreak last year, have been charged with the murder of a Burbank 
jeweler who was gunned down during a failed robbery in 1987, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The three -- all in California jails or prisons -- are suspected of slaying 
T.W. Hamilton, 50, on July 9, 1987, in his jewelry store, Creme de Le Gem, on 
West Magnolia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
They were identified by Burbank police as Michael Douglas Taylor, 36, of 
Chicago and Joe Ledezma, 25, and Thomas Estrada, 27, both of the Los Angeles 
area. Each was charged with murder and armed robbery, Burbank Police Sgt. Don 
Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is in Orange County Jail; the other two are in state prisons serving 
sentences for parole violations. Taylor allegedly masterminded an escape last 
November from Orange County Jail in which five inmates used bed sheets to climb 
down the side of the four-story building. Taylor was not captured until May. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that when armed robbers entered the jewelry store, Hamilton pulled 
out his own gun and traded shots with them before he was fatally wounded. The 
bandits escaped without any merchandise, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Shortly after the robbery, detectives started focusing on Taylor," Goldberg 
said. "That was based on a composite description of the suspect provided by 
witnesses and his known method of operation." 
</P>
<P>
However, Goldberg said, investigators did not have enough evidence to charge 
Taylor, although at the time Taylor was at large and suspected of as many as 50 
armed robberies in the Los Angeles area, many of jewelry stores. 
</P>
<P>
The break in the case came this year when Burbank investigators received help 
from Orange County sheriff's deputies, FBI agents in Des Moines, Iowa, and 
police in Seattle. Goldberg declined to reveal what evidence came from those 
agencies but said each had been involved in investigations of Taylor's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was arrested last year in Orange County and was being held on seven 
counts of armed robbery when he and four others escaped Nov. 20 from the jail 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The breakout triggered a nationwide manhunt. One escapee was caught 
immediately, one surrendered a week later and two others were captured two 
weeks afterward in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor traveled as far as Maine and eluded capture until May 20 when he was 
arrested in Rapid City, S.D., while trying to pawn diamonds believed stolen 
from a Chicago jewelry store. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that during his six months of freedom Taylor was suspected of 
a cross-country crime spree that included robberies in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.; 
Des Moines, Iowa, and Denver, and a kidnap, rape and attempted murder in 
Albany, Calif., in the Berkeley area. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was described by Goldberg and other investigators as a "big-time" 
criminal with a reputation for boldness. Police who searched a home Taylor had 
abandoned on Puget Sound, Wash., found a photograph of Taylor posing beside an 
FBI poster of wanted fugitives.

THE CONSENSUS: NOT THE MAN THEY KNEW; 
</P>
<P>
KRAFT CHARACTER WITNESSES ALL EXPRESS SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The character witnesses for Randy Steven Kraft the past two weeks have all 
given the same answer when asked their reaction to his arrest and to learning 
that he was linked to more than a dozen murders. 
</P>
<P>
They were all shocked. They have all said that the Randy they knew could never 
have done anything like that. They said they have all repeatedly searched their 
souls and queried others to see if there had been any character flaws in Kraft 
that they should have seen. But, they have all said, there was nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it; I was sure it had to be somebody else," said Liz 
Wierman, one of Kraft's former co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 44, a computer consultant from Long Beach, was convicted in Santa Ana 
two months ago of 16 Orange County murders. But prosecutors have accused him in 
court of 29 more. All the victims were young men, most between 18 and 25 years 
old. Most of them were either sexually mutilated or showed signs of sexual 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
Yet at the time of Kraft's arrest on May 14, 1983, he was a quiet, friendly 
successful businessman with close family ties and many good friends. Those 
friends came both from the gay community, where he and his roommate, Jeff 
Selig, socialized as a couple, and through contacts at the various companies 
where he worked as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But central to Kraft's life was his family: his parents in Midway City, his 
three sisters, and a broad range of uncles, cousins, nieces and in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
"Our family is so large that just about every month there was some kind of 
birthday celebration," Don Plunkett, one of Kraft's uncles, testified. "Randy 
was at every one of them that I can remember." 
</P>
<P>
Two dozen or so friends and co-workers have praised Kraft before the jury to 
the extent that one observer turned to a friend and said, "The man is a saint." 
</P>
<P>
Only one of these character witnesses, however, has even raised the suggestion 
of Kraft's guilt. Most have not volunteered any information on the subject or 
have simply said they can't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
But Olga Alvarez, who worked with Kraft at J.L. Products, said this week that 
Kraft "was very gentle, nothing of the face that we are seeing now; he's a 
complete stranger to me, what I'm seeing now." She later called it "a dark 
side" and said she is still "traumatized" by Kraft's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
She added: "I can't picture him doing all these things we are talking about 
now. It's like he had another personality or something." The defense is 
expected to finish its presentation in the penalty phase of the trial next 
week. Unless Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown offers rebuttal witnesses, the 
case would go to the jury after closing arguments and instructions from Judge 
Donald A. McCartin. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors have just one decision to make: whether to return a verdict of death 
in the gas chamber or a verdict of life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is the judge who imposes the sentence, a jury's death-verdict 
finding is more than just a recommendation to the court. If the jury votes 
death, the judge would have to set that verdict aside in order to impose a 
lesser sentence of life without parole. Since capital punishment was reinstated 
in California 12 years ago, however, no Orange County judge has ever changed a 
jury's death verdict.

SMALL FIRMS REACH CUSTOMERS VIA COUPON-STUFFED ENVELOPES; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPING AD COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
That envelope stuffed with discount coupons may be junk mail to you, but it's 
become a cost-effective way for a growing number of small businesses to get 
inside your home to peddle their products. 
</P>
<P>
It has also become a gold mine for Money Mailer, a Huntington Beach direct-mail 
firm that specializes in helping proprietors of small businesses band together 
to pitch their wares in one mailing. 
</P>
<P>
Money Mailer is one of a few national firms that specialize in what is called 
"cooperative" advertising. Such marketing gives small companies a chance to 
share the cost of direct mail by sharing space with other firms in that 
envelope you get in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
The technique also lets firms from weight-loss consultants to handymen target 
their appeals to just a few, carefully selected communities that are most 
likely to use their products or services. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably get at least one to two dozen calls a week from the coupons," said 
painting contractor Richard Scott of Anaheim. Karen Thomas, who owns a Yorba 
Linda carpet-cleaning business, estimates that 90% of her new customers come 
with coupons in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants a deal. No one wants to pay retail," said Kris O. Friedrich, 
Money Mailer's 36-year-old president and founder. 
</P>
<P>
The growing popularity of coupon advertising has resulted in the rapid 
expansion of Money Mailer. In its 10-year existence, the company has extended 
the boundaries of its coupon advertising business from Orange County to 34 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich said Money Mailer has sold franchises and rallied a national sales 
force of 500 people that has helped the company acquire a client roster of 
18,000 businesses and a mailing list that gets those coupons into 8 million 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company now has 230 regional and local franchises and is adding 
more at a clip of five to six a month. 
</P>
<P>
In the company's last fiscal year, ended in November, it earned $689,000 on 
sales of $8.3 million, he said. This year, he said he expects to garner net 
income of about $1 million on sales of $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
The way the business is set up, he said, the franchises reap the advertising 
sales revenue while "we (the franchiser) get the printing and mailing 
business." 
</P>
<P>
The company's printing and mailing headquarters in Huntington Beach has 
gradually expanded to 110 employees and to 18,000 square feet in two buildings. 
Automated assembly lines churn out 320,000 coupons every day and stuff them 
into envelopes, which are delivered to post offices. 
</P>
<P>
Friedrich said each Money Mailer franchisee divides its territory into zones of 
10,000 homes with similar demographics. Friedrich then uses surveys and 
demographic data to determine which services and products would sell best in a 
given area. 
</P>
<P>
In affluent communities like Beverly Hills and Villa Park, Friedrich said, maid 
service and car leasing are "hot" coupon items. In middle-income areas like 
Anaheim, residents are more interested in do-it-yourself products. Young 
residents in places like Irvine have a penchant for health-and-fitness 
services, while older folks in communities like Leisure World are interested in 
estate planners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage homeowners to open Money Mailer's oversize red, white and blue 
envelopes, the company emblazons on the outside of the envelopes the deal with 
the widest appeal. A Lamppost Pizza ad beckons the recipient to "Look inside 
for family special and free cash," while another coaxes him to look for 
information about a drawing for $1,000 of free groceries. 
</P>
<P>
Some advertisers have sure-fire consumer appeal, Friedrich said, and that rubs 
off on the rest. "If you get a McDonald's in your envelope, you can increase 
the (customer) response for all the advertisers by as much as a third," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An important feature of all coupon advertising by mail, Friedrich said, is that 
each advertiser is promised that his business will be the only one in its 
category that's inserted in a mailing, saving him the potential embarrassment 
of having his discount offer beaten by a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Chris La Bong, executive vice president of Smith, Hemmings, Gosden -- a 
direct-marketing advertising agency based in El Monte -- said cooperative 
advertising has been gaining in popularity with the rapidly rising cost of 
direct mail. 
</P>
<P>
La Bong said coupon advertising companies like Money Mailer "can approach the 
dry cleaners and carwash and pizza stand and give them a relatively 
sophisticated marketing tool at a low cost." 
</P>
<P>
The "down side" of such marketing, he added, is that "you have your message 
stuffed in with dozens of other messages. You are sacrificing quality and the 
opportunity to make a large statement." 
</P>
<P>
By sharing space in an envelope with 15 to 18 other businesses, a Money Mailer 
client can reach households at a cost of about 4 cents a home, or $410 for a 
minimum mailing to 10,000 households. The advertisers usually have long-term 
contracts to pay for mailings to the same addresses every other month. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, William Junkin, president of Wakeman &amp; de Forrest, a 
direct-marketing and advertising agency in Irvine, said it would cost at least 
$3,500 for a business to send a separate mailing to 10,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Robinson, a marketing consultant for medical professionals, said she finds 
that coupons work best in growth areas such as Rancho Santa Margarita and 
Irvine, where newcomers are looking for new dentists, chiropractors and 
optometrists. They are least effective in areas such as Anaheim and Garden 
Grove, where residents have established buying patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and others have found that the very success of coupon mail is diluting 
its effectiveness in some cases. As more mailing companies sprout up, some 
areas have become saturated with coupons. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gary Jacobson, an El Toro optometrist, said he started advertising with 
coupons 10 years ago and got an 8% to 9% response from people who received 
them. With more coupon firms invading the area -- each pushing its own 
optometrist -- his response rate dropped to 1% to 2%, he said.

TRIMEDYNE OF TUSTIN REPORTS $546,000 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After eight consecutive quarters of profits, Trimedyne Inc., a Tustin company 
that makes laser devices to open blocked arteries, reported a loss of $546,000 
for its third quarter ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Third-quarter revenue was $7.13 million, down from $8.3 million for the same 
quarter of fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne had net income of $1.49 million for the third quarter a year ago. Net 
income for the first nine months of 1989 was $929,000, down from $3.75 million 
for the first nine months of fiscal 1988, although revenue rose to $26.6 
million from $20.65 million for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Cooper, Trimedyne's president and chief executive officer, attributed 
the third-quarter sales decline to growing competition. 
</P>
<P>
While Trimedyne was the first to receive approval from the Food and Drug 
Administration to market a laser for treating blocked arteries in legs, he 
said, another company recently obtained FDA approval for a similar application, 
and other companies are developing competing technologies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cooper said the company's loss reflects a heftier investment in 
research and development and expansion of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
He denied that slipping sales are the result of a report presented in June by 
Dr. Martin Harrington of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York to a meeting of 
the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery. The report concluded that 
using a laser catheter in a laboratory can lead to complications. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kilpatrick, an analyst with Newport Securities, said he still believes 
that Trimedyne has "huge potential," and he is encouraged that the company is 
stepping up its research and development. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the future of the company will depend on whether its 
officers "can make the transition from solving artery problems in the leg to 
unblocking arteries around the heart, which is a much larger market." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the company plans late this year to submit an application to the 
FDA for approval to market its laser catheter as an alternative to open-heart 
surgery.

MERCURY S&amp;L BLAMES ACCOUNTING CHANGES FOR CONTINUED LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, stung last year by accounting changes that sunk it 
into red ink, posted a $1.5-million loss for the first six months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach institution reported a net loss of $851,000 for the second 
quarter, contrasted with net income of $1.5 million for last year's second 
quarter. For the six-month period last year, Mercury reported net income of 
$2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury Chairman Leonard Shane said the six-month loss, like the $13.8-million 
loss last year, was a direct result of the accounting changes required by 
regulators earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The accounting changes were necessary, he said, because incorrect assumptions 
had been made for several years involving profits recorded on the sale of 
loans. In addition, assumptions that had been used to figure Mercury's tax 
liability were incorrect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was not generated by the S&amp;L's continuing, traditional operations, 
which have been profitable, Shane said. The S&amp;L turned a profit in June and 
will record an annual profit this year, barring unforeseen setbacks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are pretty well straightened around now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury's second-quarter revenue rose 8.4% to $65.1 million from $59.6 million 
last year. For the first six months, revenue grew 8.7% to $126.7 million from 
$116.6 million in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Shane denied persistent rumors that the S&amp;L is actively seeking a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the previously announced effort to sell Mercury's five branches in 
Northern California, there are no serious talks with anyone about the sale of 
assets or the entire thrift, said Alan E. Rothenberg, a senior consultant at 
Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco investment bank hired by Mercury 18 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
But industry analysts doubt whether Mercury can remain independent under new 
capital requirements that President Bush's industry rescue effort will impose 
soon unless it sells up to half its 26 branches. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any alternative but to sell" the S&amp;L or a substantial chunk of 
the branches, said James F. Wilson, an analyst at Sutro &amp; Co. in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Capital is an institution's last reserve against losses. For most companies, it 
is the amount of money that shareholders put into the firm plus the annual 
earnings that companies retain. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last decade, capital for S&amp;Ls has included a number of other 
items that have helped to prop up the sagging industry. Those other items would 
be eliminated under the Bush rescue plan, and all S&amp;Ls would be required to 
maintain a 1.5% ratio of tangible capital to assets. 
</P>
<P>
Shane said Mercury currently exceeds regulatory requirements for capital and 
will continue to do so. He said the S&amp;L's capital at the end of March was 
$76.2 million and that about $36 million of that amount must be written off 
over time under the pending legislation. 
</P>
<P>
He said the S&amp;L's previously announced plan to sell the Northern California 
branches, to cut Mercury's assets to $2 billion by the end of the year and to 
eliminate cash dividends should help it meet capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
MERCURY SAVINGS AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, founded in 1964 by Leonard Shane, now has 25 
branches across the state and $2.3 billion in assets. Shane and his family own 
about 15% of the stock.

Harold W. Wade, president and chief executive of Childrens Hospital of Orange 
County, is retiring July 31, the hospital said. Wade, 65, has led the pediatric 
facility for the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
During Wade's tenure the hospital in Orange grew into a major pediatric center. 
"The growth of CHOC from nothing to what it is today is the biggest thrill 
anybody could ever have," Wade said of his career. 
</P>
<P>
During Wade's tenure the hospital nearly doubled its number of licensed beds to 
202 with the 1974 purchase of a five-story building now known as CHOC Tower. 
Wade was also instrumental in the purchase of another facility to house the 
hospital's clinic, administrative and medical education programs. 
</P>
<P>
CHOC recently began a $50-million program to construct a large hospital to 
replace the outdated tower and consolidate all patient beds in one building. 
</P>
<P>
Besides helping expand CHOC's real estate holdings, Wade said, he helped 
recruit a full-time staff of about 18 full-time physician specialists at the 
hospital who have introduced new treatment programs for such diseases as cancer 
and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Penn Jones, currently CHOC's chief financial officer and executive vice 
president, has been named to replace Wade. Jones has headed fiscal services for 
the past 11 years. The hospital says it is currently conducting a search for a 
new chief financial officer.

THE DAMNED STAYS TRUE TO ITS SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Damned may not have been the best or most innovative of the English punk 
groups, but in 1977 this messy goon squad was the first British punk outfit to 
issue a single and an album. And, most influentially, it was the first to play 
Los Angeles, serving as the catalyst for a revolutionary style of music and 
fashion whose ramifications still roar through the Southland's rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
It's fitting that the group ended the recent L.A. stop at the Hollywood 
Palladium on what is billed as its farewell tour in the same rowdy manner as 
its debut more than a decade ago at the Starwood: Drummer Rat Scabies 
demolished his drums while bassist-guitarist Captain Sensible (definitely not a 
contender for any health club endorsements) ran around nude. 
</P>
<P>
Like the title of one of its most ferocious rave-ups, the Damned, which plays 
Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre tonight, is still pretty "Neat Neat Neat." Running 
through a career retrospective at the Palladium, the quartet concentrated on 
the dark fury of its first and best album before adding a fifth player for 
later "hits," while a sold-out throng of kids took songs like "Smash It Up" to 
heart (and body) in the slam pit. 
</P>
<P>
This show also confirmed that underneath the obnoxious behavior and often 
sloppy, haphazard playing is a band of faithful believers in the liberating 
spirit of outrageous rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Paying tribute to that spirit with crash-and-burn versions of Beatles, Stones 
and Iggy Pop classics mixed in with its own tunes, the Damned proved that it 
deserves a place alongside the musical company it kept. 
</P>
<P>
 The Damned and Celebrity Skins play at 7:30 tonight at the Celebrity Theatre, 
201 E. Broadway, Anaheim. Tickets: $18.50. Information: (714) 999-9536.

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: PHILHARMONIC SEES DONATIONS SOAR

Other arts organizations may grouse about the difficulty of raising money in 
this county's highly competitive market, but not the Orange County Philharmonic 
Society. At the society's meeting in Newport Beach Monday night, executive 
director Erich Vollmer reported that contributions were up 64% from 1988 to 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
By far the bulk of the rise from $406,067 in 1988 to $667,257 in 1989 came from 
contributions from individuals, corporations and private foundations. 
Government support rose a modest $641 from the $52,657 figure in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Vollmer credited the increase to "hard work." 
</P>
<P>
"We really had a challenge, and the board met it," Vollmer said Tuesday. "I 
think it's also an indication that we were wise in creating the position of 
director of development. It was long overdue." Eve R. Henderson was appointed 
development director in October. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where no one person deserves the lion's share of the credit," 
Vollmer added. "It was truly a group effort. It was nonprofit at its best." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the society ended the year with a small deficit of $16,588 in a 
$2.3-million budget. "That's piddling, after what we dealt with last year," 
Vollmer said. The amount was left over from a debt of $46,910 that resulted 
from co-sponsorship of the New World Music Festival at the Performing Arts 
Center and UC Irvine in the summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Vollmer added that 54,806 people attended 22 society-sponsored concerts at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, for what officials said was 
an 86% hall-occupancy rate. 
</P>
<P>

ELVIS HITLER JABS AT TRASH CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A canny, icon-bashing name still capable of shock appeal, Elvis Hitler suggests 
all kinds of satirical possibilities. But do not expect any socially acute 
agit-punk (i.e., the Dead Kennedys) from this Michigan-based quartet, which 
plays tonight at Night Moves in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Neither "skinhead" fascists nor a theatrical novelty, Hitler's stocky lead 
singer-guitarist, Jim Leedy, does not wear a tiny mustache or a big pompadour, 
and his band is about as political as corn pone. 
</P>
<P>
Playing Raji's in Los Angeles this weekend, Hitler blasted a brand of 
"hellbilly" faster than a speed-metal bullet racing "From Berlin to Memphis." 
That title is where the Third Reich 'n' Roll comparisons begin and end: 
Primarily, these turbo-charged songs (befitting a Motor City outfit) are about 
automobiles; the band's philosophy is summed up in this motto: "Live fast, die 
young and leave a good car." 
</P>
<P>
Hitler's humor jabs at the soft underbelly of American trash culture with 
post-adolescent humor. The high point of this kind of wit was the group's 
juxtaposition of the "Green Acres" theme song over Jimi Hendrix's "Purple 
Haze," the kind of silliness that goes over big with fans of such pop-culture 
trash shows as MTV's "Remote Control." 
</P>
<P>
Elvis Hitler is not breaking new ground -- such bands as the Cramps and all 
that followed them tilled this particular shock 'n' roll field years ago -- but 
with their high-velocity assault and ferocious enthusiasm, they come awfully 
close to crashing the sound barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Congress Of, which ended the evening, is becoming one of the local 
scene's vital musical resources, a primarily instrumental quartet capable of 
sliding from funky blues to free-jazz improvisations to sly be-bop. The band's 
intricate, multilayered, rebirth-of-cool approach lies far outside the 
rock-club mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
That UCO can make these sounds so accessible and appealing is just another 
indication of this band's increasing artistry. A band for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Elvis Hitler, Tube Blaster Overdrive and the Don Hodads play tonight at 9:30 
at Night Moves, 5902 Warner Ave., Huntington Beach. Admission: $3. Information: 
(714) 840-6118.

BUSH DISAGREES WITH REAGAN, BACKS LIMIT OF 2 TERMS IN OFFICE

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush said in an interview released today that he does not agree with 
former President Ronald Reagan that the Constitution's 22nd Amendment limiting 
the chief executive to two terms should be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told Knight-Ridder Newspapers that he supports the "status quo," unlike 
his predecessor who complained about the limit and even indicated that he would 
have enjoyed seeking a third term despite being the oldest President in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, 78, vowed to campaign for repeal of the amendment after he left office 
six months ago. The amendment was promoted during his own younger political 
days by Republicans upset at the four White House terms won by Democrat 
Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Special weapons and tactics deputies arrested an armed, distraught man early 
this morning after he had holed up in a Santa Ana-area garage Tuesday for an 
all-night standoff, according to a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Jones Morgan, 47, was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon 
after he allegedly fired several shots at his wife, then retreated to his 
home's garage, where he refused to come out and repeatedly threatened to kill 
himself, said Sheriff's Lt. Bob Rivas. 
</P>
<P>
About 9 p.m. Tuesday, deputies went to the home in the 12000 block of Dunas 
Road after receiving a report of shots being fired, Rivas said. After Morgan's 
wife and teen-age son escaped through a window, deputies called for Morgan to 
leave the detached garage. 
</P>
<P>
Crisis negotiators talked with Morgan through the night as the man waved a 
9-millimeter pistol and threatened suicide. About 7:10 a.m. today, SWAT 
deputies hurled flash-bang grenades into the garage to distract Morgan, then 
tackled him. Rivas said the man was reportedly distraught over marriage 
difficulties.

The annual Academy Awards presentations will return next year to the Los 
Angeles Music Center after two years at the city's Shrine Auditorium, it was 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The academy's Board of Governors said the ceremonies will be held March 26, 
1990, at the Music Center, which had been their home for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
Academy President Richard Kahn said the academy had not ruled out returning to 
the cavernous Shrine in the future, despite horrendous traffic conditions and 
the fact that most academy members prefer the newer, smaller, less congested 
Music Center.

N. HOLLYWOOD MAN ARRESTED AFTER SHOOTING AT POLICE AND HELICOPTER

<P>
A reportedly suicidal man who fired several shots at police and at a helicopter 
was arrested this morning after a two-hour standoff at his North Hollywood 
home, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Raymond Molenda, 31, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 
police officer after he walked out of his home in the 5400 block of Morella 
Avenue, Sgt. Ike Langsam said. He is being held at the Van Nuys Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Molenda barricaded himself in his house with a handgun about 11 p.m. Tuesday 
and refused to emerge after his wife went to the North Hollywood police station 
and reported that her husband was armed and suicidal, Langsam said. 
</P>
<P>
Molenda told the first officers to approach the house to go away, threatening 
to shoot if they did not, Langsam said. They took cover and, when backup 
officers arrived, Molenda fired more than six shots at them and at a police 
helicopter circling above, authorities said. No one was hit, and police fired 
two shots back, missing Molenda. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Chate Aszanonda fired the two shots, then was knocked unconscious when 
he tried to jump out of Molenda's line of fire and struck his head on a wall, 
police said. His partner, Don Tsunawaki, a rookie, went into the line of fire 
and carried Aszanonda to safety, police said. The injured officer was treated 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The department's special weapons and tactics unit was called to the scene and 
an officer, speaking to Molenda by phone, was able to talk the gunman into 
surrendering about 1:30 a.m.

Steve Rubell, who revolutionized New York night life with the Studio 54 disco 
in the 1970s and with the Palladium in the 1980s, died today at a Manhattan 
hospital. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell, who went to prison with his partner, Ian Schrager, for tax fraud, died 
at Beth Israel Medical Center from complications resulting from hepatitis and 
septic shock, a form of shock that spreads through the bloodstream, said Dan 
Klores, a spokesman for the family. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell and Schrager opened Studio 54 in 1977 and the former 
theater-turned-disco immediately drew leading celebrities such as Bianca 
Jagger, Calvin Klein and Andy Warhol at the height of the disco craze. 
</P>
<P>
With his mother in the basement counting the take, the 5-foot-6 Rubell ran the 
door at the exclusive nightspot, blessing the elite with a nod of approval and 
entry to the disco temple as eager rejects milled outside, waving and crying 
out his name. 
</P>
<P>
But the club closed in 1980 after Rubell and Schrager pleaded guilty to 
avoiding taxes on about $2.5 million in profits from the club. 
</P>
<P>
They both served short federal jail sentences at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala. 
Rubell and Schrager, however, rebounded to start the Palladium, which became 
just as chic and filled with celebrities as Studio 54. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell is survived by his parents and a brother.

A Continental Airlines DC-9 suffered partial hydraulic failure Tuesday evening 
and fishtailed in an emergency landing at Newark International Airport. None of 
the 89 people aboard the flight were injured. 
</P>
<P>
A light indicating a hydraulic problem came on in the cockpit of Flight 354 
from Chicago about 20 minutes before its scheduled landing at Newark, spokesman 
Ned Walker said in a telephone interview from Continental's headquarters in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The plane appeared to have suffered a loss of one of its hydraulic systems, and 
a partial loss of the other, Walker said. But unlike the DC-10 that crashed in 
Iowa last week, the DC-9 doesn't require hydraulics for maneuverability, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the DC-9's six tires blew out and the plane fishtailed as it skidded 
three-quarters of the way down the 9,800-foot runway shortly after 8 p.m. It 
ended up sitting perpendicular to the runway.

THATCHER'S RESHUFFLING OF CABINET CALLED A SHAMBLES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher tried today to limit the political fallout 
from a Cabinet reshuffle that the opposition has described as a shambles. 
</P>
<P>
British newspapers said in virtually identical reports that Thatcher offered 
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe a new post as home secretary -- unbeknown 
to the man still in the job, Douglas Hurd, who eventually kept it. 
</P>
<P>
After several hours of discussion with family and friends, Howe turned down the 
Home Office and reluctantly opted for Thatcher's other offer -- leadership of 
the House of Commons. This makes him effectively the ruling Conservative 
Party's parliamentary manager. 
</P>
<P>
But he insisted on being given the courtesy title of deputy prime minister and 
the chairmanship of several key committees. 
</P>
<P>
Officials, usually quick to knock down inaccurate or unfavorable leaks, refused 
to confirm or deny the newspaper reports. 
</P>
<P>
But political analysts said the reshuffle may have strained ties between 
Thatcher and her top three officials: Howe, Hurd and Chancellor of the 
Exchequer Nigel Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock described the reshuffle, Britain's biggest 
Cabinet shake-up since 1962, as a shambles, and opposition members said Hurd's 
position had been undermined. 
</P>
<P>
There had been differences between Thatcher and Howe over some issues, such as 
full membership of the European Monetary System, which the prime minister has 
always said Britain is not ready to join. 
</P>
<P>
By leaving the Foreign Office, Howe, who has no London home of his own, lost 
his official residence in the capital and the country mansion that goes with 
the post. 
</P>
<P>
As recompense, Thatcher offered him another country mansion she allocated only 
last year to Lawson. The officials said Lawson had agreed to vacate this house, 
Dorneywood, but only after holidaying there with his family.

CORNELL STUDENT INDICTED OVER MASS COMPUTER VIRUS

A Cornell University graduate student blamed for a rogue computer program that 
infected as many as 6,000 computers with an electronic virus was indicted today 
on a felony computer-crime charge. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Tappan Morris was indicted by a federal grand jury in Syracuse, N.Y., on 
one count of accessing without authorization at least six computers in which 
the federal government has an interest. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who has been criticized by a Cornell University commission that 
investigated last November's computer virus incident, is the first person to be 
charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, the Justice Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who is on leave from Cornell, could face a possible five-year sentence 
and a $250,000 fine if convicted. He could also be required to pay restitution 
to universities and military bases where computers were paralyzed by the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Morris has told friends that he created the virus but did not intend for it to 
invade computers around the country. The virus infected as many as 6,000 
university and military computers on the nationwide ARPANET network, which is 
used by universities and military contractors to transmit unclassified data. 
</P>
<P>
The network was virtually shut down for several days, although no information 
stored in the computers was lost.

Congressional negotiators agreed today to limit investment by savings and loans 
in junk bonds, and they promised to work past midnight to resolve other 
differences holding up the multibillion-dollar S &amp; L bailout. 
</P>
<P>
A compromise adopted by representatives of the House and Senate would require S 
&amp; Ls to sell their junk bonds as soon as possible, but no later than Aug. 
1, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
After that, an S &amp; L could own junk bonds only through a separately 
capitalized affiliate that would insulate federally insured deposits from any 
risk of loss from the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Compromises 
</P>
<P>
The Senate also offered compromises in two other areas: capital rules governing 
how much money S &amp; L owners are required to invest in their institutions 
and the extent to which S &amp; Ls must finance housing. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the Senate is insisting on its own positions permitting S &amp; L 
regulator M. Danny Wall to continue in his job for at least two years and 
giving power over state-chartered thrifts to S &amp; L regulators within the 
Treasury Department rather than to the independent Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The offer does not address the biggest issue dividing the House and Senate -- 
whether S &amp; L spending is included in the budget deficit. The Bush 
Administration and the Senate want to keep $50 billion out of the deficit. 
Democrats and the House would balloon the deficit but prevent S &amp; L 
spending from triggering automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), the leader of the five-member Senate 
delegation, promised to work into the early morning hours if necessary in order 
to finish work this week. Congress begins its monthlong summer recess Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Here are details of the Senate's latest proposal: 
</P>
<P>
 -- S &amp; L owners would have to come up with $1.50 in capital for every $100 
in lending immediately on passage of the bill, but regulators would not be 
required to limit the growth of institutions violating the rule until June, 
1991. The requirement would be raised in steps to $3 by 1995. S &amp; Ls that 
have purchased the right to collect mortgage payments from homeowners will be 
allowed to count 90% of the market value of those contracts as capital. 
</P>
<P>
 -- S &amp; Ls would have to devote 55% of their assets to housing, including 
residential mortgages, home construction loans, home improvement loans, mobile 
home loans and home equity loans. The current standard is 60% but is much more 
loosely defined. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, would stay in his job 
as head of the new Office of Thrift Supervision within the Treasury Department. 
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman would also retain his position. Rep. Henry B. 
Gonzalez (D-Tex.), leader of House negotiators, has said Wall deceived Congress 
last year about the extent of the S &amp; L crisis and has been insisting that 
Wall undergo a new confirmation vote by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Office of Thrift Supervision would retain its power over 
state-chartered thrifts as well as national S&amp;Ls.

Debt-burdened Hooker Corp., an Australian property group which owns the 
exclusive Bonwit Teller department stores in the United States, began 
liquidating today as banks pressed the company for overdue payments. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker said in a statement that it had no choice but to go into the initial 
stages of forced asset sales after a task force of more than 40 banks Tuesday 
abruptly ended an agreement on a four-month debt repayment moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium, agreed to only two weeks ago, was aimed at giving Hooker time 
to sell off assets to reduce its total debt of $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker has been brought down by near-record interest rates and a cooling 
property market in Australia, as well as an aggressive and expensive foray into 
U.S. retailing and property since Romanian-born developer George Herscu gained 
control of the group in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker became one of the best known Australian companies in the United States 
under Herscu, sweeping up control of retailers such as Bonwit Teller, Parisian 
Inc., Merksamer Jewelers, B. Altman &amp; Co. and Sakowitz department stores. 
</P>
<P>
It also became heavily involved in U.S. real estate and built three shopping 
malls, now up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Herscu poured more than $1 billion into the United States where Hooker's 
problems first came to light earlier this year with suppliers complaining to 
the media about slow payments. 
</P>
<P>
The bank task force did not say why they cut Hooker off, but banking sources 
said it was because Herscu refused to relinquish control to let the lenders 
recover their loans by an orderly sale of assets. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker shares more than halved to 13 cents in early stock exchange trading 
today from Tuesday's close of 28 cents before bargain hunters pushed them up to 
close at 19 cents. 
</P>
<P>
They will be virtually worthless Thursday if the Australian Stock Exchange 
follows its normal course of suspending trading in the shares of a company in 
liquidation.

Eastern Airlines said today it will no longer seek court permission to break 
its contract with the Air Line Pilots Assn. because that request appears to 
have become counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern sought bankruptcy court permission June 22 to break the contract so it 
could impose temporary pay cuts and permanent work rule changes on pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern pilots walked off the job March 4 in sympathy with striking co-workers. 
Eastern filed for bankruptcy five days later. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, pilots were negotiating a new contract with management. The terms 
of the old contract have remained in force pending the outcome of those 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
By seeking permission to break the contract, "Eastern hoped to initiate a 
series of negotiations which would ultimately result in a prompt settlement of 
the ALPA labor dispute," Eastern said in a statement submitted to the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it now appears that its request "may be an impediment to 
resolving the dispute at this particular time." Eastern said it withdrew the 
request as a result. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the pilots union expressed surprise at Eastern's reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, they (Eastern) used the bankruptcy court for other purposes," 
ALPA spokesman Hank Weber said. "What an admission. Now you understand why we 
pilots have very little trust for the management."

International Business Machines Corp. suffered an embarrassing setback today 
when it announced that technical difficulties had forced it to cancel the 
introduction of an important new disk-storage product for its mainframe 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
IBM shares were off $1.625 to $111.125 as investors worried that the delay in 
the new unit would cause short-term earnings to suffer. Sales of the device had 
been expected to reach $1.5 billion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the new product, which had been scheduled Tuesday, was canceled 
at the last minute after the computer manufacturer said tests had revealed 
problems. The company gave no indication of when the disk drives would be 
available.

Twelve states including New York and California filed suit in Manhattan federal 
court today charging the Visa and MasterCard companies with conspiring to 
monopolize the potentially multibillion-dollar debit card market. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies allegedly undermined competition through a joint venture, 
called Entree, and by acquiring the nation's two largest automated teller 
machine networks, New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams said. The two ATM networks, 
Cirrus System Inc. and Plus System Inc., formulated their own plans for 
national debit card networks in the early and mid-1980s, Abrams said. 
</P>
<P>
Visa also took over the West Coast-based Interlink Network, the nation's 
largest regional debit card network. 
</P>
<P>
A debit card is used like a credit card, but the money is automatically 
transferred from the cardholder's account to the merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Visa and MasterCard signed an agreement in 1987 to jointly introduce Entree. 
More than 177 financial institutions have joined Entree, and 1.4 million Entree 
ATM cards have been issued. But the two companies have not introduced the 
program to merchants, Abrams said. He said the companies have apparently chosen 
instead to continue to promote their highly profitable credit card business.

LEONARD, DURAN: THEY'LL FIGHT, BUT WHEN? WHERE?

It finally became official today: The tour guides for boxing's latest stroll 
down memory lane will be Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran. 
</P>
<P>
The two legendary fighters will meet in November for the third time, nine years 
after Duran quit against Leonard in the eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Bob Arum promised that Duran would "fight to the last breath" to make 
up for the infamous "No Mas" fight in New Orleans on Nov. 25, 1980, when he 
waved his hands and said: "No mas, no mas (no more, no more)." 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian, nicknamed "Hands of Stone," never fully explained why he had a 
heart of mush that night when Leonard took back the World Boxing Council 
welterweight title he had lost to Duran five months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference today to announce the fight, Duran said he was tired of 
being asked what happened in New Orleans. "I'll explain to the world after I 
beat Sugar Ray Leonard why I quit," he said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Duran, flashing gold bracelets, a silver medallion around his neck and a 
dangling diamond earring, said: "Every day it's 'no mas, no mas.' Let's talk 
about this fight." 
</P>
<P>
The exact date and site of the fight -- naturally dubbed by Arum "Uno Mas," 
(one more) have not yet been set as promoters are still listening to offers 
from casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas to hold the fight, which will take 
place either on Nov. 2 or on Nov. 30.

BIG 10 COACHES ASK MANDATORY STEROID TESTING

Big Ten football coaches are calling for mandatory leaguewide testing for 
anabolic steroids, saying it is necessary to assure the health and safety of 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches concluded Tuesday, after a closed meeting in Chicago, that uniform 
testing should be initiated, the Detroit Free Press reported today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be expensive, but we've got to stamp this thing out," said Bo 
Schembechler, Michigan coach and athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches, physicians and trainers plan further studies before adopting any 
formal plans. Any such plan would need approval by university presidents, 
athletic directors and faculty representatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quite Feasible' 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State team doctor Robert Murphy, one of the physicians who proposed 
conference testing in May, made a presentation Tuesday before the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the program they outlined is quite feasible," Illinois Coach John 
Mackovic said. "But we're dealing with seven states and state universities. 
Different states and universities have different policies." 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that everybody is testing right now and everyone is in 
favor of a drug-testing program," Michigan State Coach George Perles said. 
"We're diligently working on it to see what can be done." 
</P>
<P>
Use of anabolic steroids increases a player's size and strength, but side 
effects include liver dysfunction, heart and vascular problems and hair loss.
