STUDY FINDS GROWING ANGLO-MINORITY GAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gap between mostly Anglo "haves" and minority "have-nots" is worsening in 
Los Angeles, and without changes in education, government policies and housing, 
the inequities are likely to further divide the city, a UCLA study found. 
</P>
<P>
The study said worsening neighborhood segregation, inferior inner-city 
education, limited job opportunities and lower pay are causing Latinos to fall 
further and further behind Anglos, while blacks are stuck at the same low level 
they held in 1969. It found: 
</P>
<P>
American-born Latino men on the average now earn 78 cents for each dollar paid 
to an Anglo male with the same years of schooling and experience. In 1969, 
Latino men earned 90 cents per dollar paid to an Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
For each dollar paid to an Anglo man, Anglo women earn 62 cents, black women 56 
cents, American-born Latinas 47 cents and Latina immigrants 30 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Because of low pay, 14% of full-time workers live in poverty. This is 
particularly acute among Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
City schools, where four out of five students are non-Anglo, are producing 
large numbers of graduates who have only 8th- and 9th-grade skills and cannot 
compete for college or good jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ong, who oversaw the study, said the researchers' goal was to alert public 
policy makers that deep problems loom ahead unless changes are made.

MAKEUP ARTIST MAURICE SEIDERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maurice Seiderman, an inventor, sculptor and makeup artist whose elaborate 
masks and skin putty were used to age Orson Welles and his co-stars several 
decades in the course of the film "Citizen Kane," has died in Port Angeles, 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Nathan, said he died July 17 at age 81 after a series of heart 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the Soviet Union, Seiderman studied art in New York before joining RKO 
Studios as a junior member of the makeup department in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the problem of aging the characters in "Citizen Kane" as much 
as 50 years, he made a series of plaster casts of the principal actors and 
sculpted pieces of molded plastic foam for each in which their features 
gradually sagged and their hair thinned. 
</P>
<P>
He also was an inventor who researched the use of contact lenses and held 
several patents in that field. It was his skill there that produced the aging 
eyes of the actors. 
</P>
<P>
"Citizen Kane" was not Seiderman's only challenge; he also produced the 
disfigured faces in "Enchanted Cottage," the makeup and wigs in "Gunga Din" and 
"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and worked on such Welles classic films as "The 
Magnificent Ambersons" and "Macbeth." 
</P>
<P>
He made Raymond Massey into "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" and Judith Anderson into 
"Lady Scarface." 
</P>
<P>
Seiderman also was a versatile inventor and businessman, his brother said. He 
pursued business enterprises ranging from doll manufacturing to research for 
the Waring blender. 
</P>
<P>
Late in his life, he became an artist, painting abstracts on slides under a 
microscope he designed himself. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his brother, he is survived by his wife, Celita.

<TEXT>
<P>
the co-owner of Studio 54 who reigned over New York's night life during the 
disco craze until his arrest for skimming club receipts, died Wednesday. He was 
45. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell, who was convicted of tax evasion at the height of his club's 
popularity, died of complications from hepatitis and septic shock at Beth 
Israel Hospital, said publicist Dan Klores, who would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell befriended celebrities from Liza Minnelli to Madonna during his 25 years 
of business dealings with his partner and college buddy Ian Schrager. 
</P>
<P>
The pair became the toast of Manhattan night life after opening Studio 54 on 
April 26, 1977, playing host to Andy Warhol, Bianca Jagger, Elizabeth Taylor 
and Cheryl Tiegs night after night. Rubell's activities earned prominent 
mention in "The Andy Warhol Diaries," a current best-seller. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell, the extrovert of the pair, could often be found hanging out inside, 
being seen with the stars while checking out business. His mother counted the 
club's receipts in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell often worked the club's front door, selectively admitting celebrities 
and night-crawlers, spurning others queued outside. Among those he failed to 
recognize and refused: John Kennedy Jr. and Warren Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
The high life ended with a 1979 tax evasion conviction after authorities 
discovered $300,000 in cash in the trunk of Schrager's car. 
</P>
<P>
The Rubell and Schrager tried to avoid prosecution with a deal to testify 
against President Jimmy Carter's chief of staff, Hamilton Jordan, claiming that 
the official had snorted cocaine in their club. That deal went nowhere and 
Jordan was never charged. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1980, Rubell and Schrager were sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison 
but their sentences were reduced after they turned in several other club 
owners. They were released from prison Jan. 30, 1981, and sold Studio 54 a 
short time later. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell and Schrager returned to New York, channeling their efforts into the 
hotel business. Within four years, they were operating Morgans Hotel and 
running another nightclub, the Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Rubell became a club scene presence. On opening night at the 
Palladium, Boy George, actor Matt Dillon and other celebrities turned out and 
the club took off. 
</P>
<P>
The pair continued their hotel work, renovating and reopening the Royalton 
Hotel in Manhattan. They were in the process of renovating the Century 
Paramount Hotel off Times Square and had bought the Barbizon Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell also discussed plans to develop a resort in Florida or the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell is survived by his parents, a brother, a niece and a nephew. 
</P>
<P>
A private funeral service was planned for today.

ARTIST EMIL WHITE; HENRY MILLER'S FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BIG SUR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emil White, artist and sidekick of author Henry Miller, died last week in his 
redwood cabin in Big Sur, friends said. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
White's cabin was full of mementos of his lengthy friendship with Miller, the 
"grandfather of the sexual revolution" who also died at the age of 88 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
White passed away in his sleep last Thursday after a long battle with 
Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said White's health had been deteriorating for the last several months. 
Last April, dozens of friends flocked to his cabin, perched on a cliff 
overlooking the Pacific, to celebrate his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"People were streaming in, and women were hugging and kissing him and bringing 
him flowers and cakes," White's sister, Toni White of Chicago, recalled. "He 
was very fond of women and they were very fond of him." 
</P>
<P>
White, considered one of Big Sur's pioneers, painted canvasses noted for their 
primitive, minutely detailed style. They are shown in art galleries in the 
Monterey area, as well as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, 
Minneapolis and throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
White began his painting career around 1944, after being introduced to the 
beauty of the Central Coast by Miller, his idol and friend who lived in the 
area from the early 1940s to the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
By the late '40s, news clippings referred to White as "the mayor and president 
of the Chamber of Commerce of Big Sur." 
</P>
<P>
White dedicated most of his adult life to Miller, first as his trusted 
companion and then as curator of the Henry Miller Memorial Library in Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
While Miller, some of whose novels were once banned in the United States, was 
considered the grandfather of the sexual revolution, White was its most avid 
practitioner, according to Ephraim Doner of Carmel Highlands, a longtime friend 
of White. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought of himself as one of the great lovers of women," Doner said. "I 
think Emil was the essence of Henry's ideas. Henry was just amusing and 
entertaining. He threw things into the air. Emil lived them."

ASSAULT AGAINST VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Violence is an everyday occurrence in parts of the black community. Murders are 
common in poor neighborhoods. But the fatal shooting of two women at a church 
in Southeast Los Angeles is prompting many black worshipers to wonder if any 
place is safe, even though the cause was not gangs, as originally suspected, 
but appears to have been a domestic dispute. The murders nonetheless 
highlighted the somber facts of life in many parts of this metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
A more sustained assault on drugs, gangs and crime is necessary to reduce the 
rampant lawlessness and hopelessness. Everyone must find a way to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) deserves credit for quickly taking 
the lead. She attended services with the grief-stricken congregation on Sunday 
and announced, in conjunction with the Black Women's Forum, a $5,000 reward. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley is meeting with police officials and black religious leaders 
in theaftermath of the tragedy. Such gatherings and rewards are steps in the 
right direction, but only preliminary ones. 
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood Crusade, a black-run philanthropy, is setting up community 
patrols in a 110-block area of South-Central Los Angeles. As many as 500 men, 
volunteers armed only with walkie-talkies, will patrol day and night during the 
campaign "To Take Our Community Back." The street patrols will depend primarily 
on black men from the target area and neighborhood block clubs, but the entire 
city is invited to a kickoff picnic Aug. 5 at Green Meadows Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood Crusade's 45-day campaign is supported by hundreds of black 
churches and dozens of organizations. The crusade hopes Los Angeles businesses 
will make a major contribution by committing themselves to hire one unemployed 
person each. The number to call is (213) 231-2171. The crusade also wants 
volunteers to address housing problems, illiteracy, health concerns, 
recreational needs and other pressing problems in the high-crime area bounded 
by 93rd Street, Manchester and Central avenues and Avalon Boulevard. Volunteers 
also can help by removing trash, painting out graffiti and making small 
repairs. The combined effort can make the area attractive as well as safe. 
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood Crusade campaign to attack crime and grime must succeed. The 
volunteers must then tackle neighborhood after neighborhood. At the very least, 
more law-abiding citizens must take a stand.

SUPPORT THE COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agreement that could free California from its financial straitjacket is at 
grave risk. The education community did not get everything it wanted when the 
governor and state Legislature reached this agreement and now may not support 
the complex package when it goes before the voters as a constitutional 
amendment next June. State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig says, "The 
whole deal is up in the air." A California Teachers Assn. official describes 
the group's position as "probably more hostile neutral than neutral neutral." 
Those attitudes are indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, everyone benefits from giving the state more fiscal 
maneuvering room -- the schools included. Therefore, everyone should work 
together to encourage voters to pass the financing agreement -- schools 
included. 
</P>
<P>
The artificial spending limits imposed on the state by the 1979 Gann initiative 
have severely restricted the state's ability to finance health-care and 
mental-health programs as well as provide services for poor people. At last 
there is the opportunity to relax the rigid Gann limits and increase the 
gasoline tax to meet critical transportation needs while increasing school 
spending with an unexpected tax windfall. 
</P>
<P>
As negotiators strained to reach this agreement last month, Honig was at first 
a help, then a hindrance. He compromised when legislators from rural and 
suburban school districts wanted a larger share of education money, and he was 
even willing to give up some of the potential gains for schools that voters had 
passed under Proposition 98. 
</P>
<P>
Then he objected to deleting several guarantees in the agreement, including one 
that would have built any future state surplus money into the schools' basic 
budget for the following year as called for in Proposition 98. But it is 
important to remember that schools still will receive more money than they did 
before Proposition 98 passed, although not as large a share of the surplus as 
they would have received before 98 was modified. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said as much himself in withdrawing his opposition to the settlement the 
day it was announced. The negotiators did not make "the very extreme changes in 
Proposition 98 that were being considered," Honig said then. "Basically, we 
were successful in beating back efforts to gut 98." 
</P>
<P>
California is a state in search of a financial solution for a host of problems, 
only one of which is the critical need for better education for its youngsters. 
In this constitutional amendment, it has the start of that solution, a 
compromise that deserves the widest possible public support.

A STRANGE SPY STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Did Felix Bloch, a Foreign Service officer for 30 years and former deputy chief 
of mission in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, pass sensitive information to a 
Soviet agent in Paris earlier this year? Did he provide Austrian officials with 
classified information about an American investigation into the Nazi past of 
Austrian President Kurt Waldheim? Was he warned in a coded message from a 
Soviet operative in Washington last month that he was under FBI surveillance, 
thus effectively ending hopes that he might be caught in an incriminating act? 
All these allegations and more have been reported and speculated on. President 
Bush says he has been briefed on them, and describes them as "very serious" if 
true. Yet for all the public notice given this matter Bloch remains charged 
with nothing. He has not even been taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
The Bloch case is one that has obvious potentially serious implications, but 
one that also seems for now to hang on thin legal threads. Bloch was suspended 
with pay from his State Department job after he refused to cooperate with 
security officials. That was more than a month ago. Since then no further legal 
measures have been taken against him. Yet he and his family remain under highly 
visible and intense public scrutiny, their home staked out, their every move 
monitored by government agents and television camera crews. Bloch cannot walk 
his dog without a convoy of FBI cars revving up and setting off in low-speed 
pursuit. By one account, at least seven FBI cars, each carrying a couple of 
agents, keep constant watch on Bloch. That is a considerable allocation of 
resources, at considerable expense. To what end? 
</P>
<P>
The effort appears to have been mounted in hope of (1) putting Bloch under 
enough psychological pressure so that he will break down and tell all, or (2) 
spooking him into trying to flee the country, an act that could be taken as a 
presumptive sign that he has something illegal to hide and lead to his arrest. 
The apparent reasons for these extraordinary measures is that the government 
has little hard evidence gainst Bloch. It does have a videotape that shows a 
known Soviet agent who was being shadowed in Paris meeting with Bloch, who gave 
him a briefcase; until that point, it seems, Bloch himself had not fallen under 
suspicion. Handing over a briefcase to a KGB agent is an act that raises the 
gravest of suspicions. The problem is apparently that U.S. officials don't know 
whether the briefcase contained state secrets, dirty laundry or nothing at all, 
and Bloch isn't saying. That silence was enough to get him placed on 
administrative leave. It's not enough to get him arrested, let alone charged 
and convicted. 
</P>
<P>
So the deliberately high-profile game of surveillance goes on, trusting that 
somehow a break will occur. Officially the surveillance is justified as part of 
a continuing security investigation. The troubling question is at what point 
does a legitimate investigation cross the line to become harassment, and under 
what conditions are the civil rights of a suspect and his family -- among them 
the right to privacy -- improperly violated by the state? These aren't easy 
questions to answer. That they need to be asked is a further sign that this has 
been one of the odder national security investigations in recent memory and, 
given the manner of its unfolding, one of the more disturbing.

SPOTTED OWLS AND LOGGERS

<TEXT>
<P>
It is difficult to have much sympathy for a person who would display a bumper 
sticker reading "Save a Logger, Eat an Owl." The loggers assume that humans are 
unquestionably more important than a bird. There are many of us who do not 
necessarily agree that the concerns of humans give them the right to drive 
other species to extinction. The loggers will not starve to death. 
</P>
<P>
Let them find a more respectable line of work. Our country has been thoroughly 
butchered in the name of economic growth and "development" (a despicable 
euphemism). Thank God the ranks of environmentalists are growing and that now 
other species have a fighting chance. It's too late for the California grizzly 
and condor.

SPOTTED OWLS AND LOGGERS

<TEXT>
<P>
I'm distressed that you published Mark A. Stein's one-sided lament for loggers 
in Sweet Home, Ore., who are supposedly losing work because environmentalists 
are trying to save the spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
We in the U.S. decry Brazil's and Indonesia's felling of their tropical rain 
forests while we decimate our own old-growth forest at an equally reckless 
rate, contributing to the same global crises: release of carbon dioxide, 
exacerbating the greenhouse effect; and loss of habitat, reducing species 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
The "jobs vs. environment" dichotomy is a red herring. Most timber unemployment 
has resulted from modernization of mill equipment. More jobs are lost because 
so many logs are now shipped, unprocessed, to Japan. (We harvest more wood than 
we need and sell 25% to Japan. Yet the Forest Service proposes chopping 25% 
more over the next decade!) 
</P>
<P>
A study by resource economist Jeffrey T. Olson shows that taking 25% less wood 
would eliminate only 2,300 jobs in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Industry "research" to duplicate spotted owl habitat in the monoculture tree 
plantations with which it replaces nature's forests is absurd. What about all 
the other old growth-dependent species whose survival is threatened by 
ever-shrinking habitat -- grizzly bear, gray wolf, mountain lion, mountain 
goat, wolverine, lynx, fisher, flying squirrel, red tree vole, bog lemming, 
rough-skinned newt, Olympic salamander, tailed frog, goshawk, harlequin duck, 
marbled murrelet, pileated, red-cockaded and three-toed woodpecker, elegant 
trogon, red crossbill, olive-sided flycatcher?

In your article Oregonians invite outsiders to their state to see "we aren't 
about to cut down the last tree," as one logging-industry worker's quote put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
I have been to Oregon. True, they will not cut down their last tree tomorrow or 
next week. But if they don't start dealing with the reality environmentalists 
are helping them face, they will sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
So they are losing money today because they can't cut down those magnificent 
old-growth trees -- the few that remain? What happens after the temporary 
financial fix that would be provided by the "logging" of the remaining old 
growth? Then they will be in trouble with no one left to blame. Unless you love 
the sight of gray concrete more than green trees, you cannot help but finish a 
visit to Oregon with a broken heart, as you see hideous hillsides strewn with 
the leftovers of clear-cut logging, and gigantic trucks rumbling along the road 
brimming with the remains of massive trees that took hundreds of years to grow 
and just hours to cut down. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle between saving our Earth and saving their bank accounts is only 
part of the issue. Your reporter did not point out the problem of Northwest 
logs going straight from forest to foreign country -- closing down sawmills not 
because of a lack of log supply, but because the work is being done overseas. 
During my trip through Oregon a few months ago, I saw ships being packed full 
of logs headed to Japan. As someone pointed out in a local newspaper article I 
read at the time, it is virtually a "banana republic" practice, raping our 
resources for some other, more prosperous nation's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
One other note -- the people who make their living at weapons plants might 
study what is happening in the Northwest and get a better jump on planning how 
to cope once their destructive profession no longer makes sense for our 
survival.

SERVICE TO BE FRIDAY FOR LAW FIRM PARTNER, VICTIM OF HEART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A memorial service will be conducted Friday for a founding partner in a 
Tustin-based law firm who passed away last week after a sudden heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
The service for Scott M. McCune, 40, is to be held at 2 p.m. at Trinity 
Presbyterian Church, 17th Street and Prospect Avenue in Tustin. Donations are 
being accepted to fund a memorial scholarship at Western State University 
School of Law. Inquiries can be directed to Larry Willis at (714) 730-5700. 
</P>
<P>
McCune died Saturday at Torrance Memorial Hospital as the result of a heart 
attack, his business associates said. A specialist in insurance law, McCune in 
1975 helped found the law firm of Callahan, McCune &amp; Willis, which is based 
in Tustin and also has offices in West Los Angeles and San Diego. He also 
served as a judge pro tem in Los Angeles and Orange County courts and lectured 
to law and insurance groups. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Brandi; a daughter, Christina Marie, 2; a sister, 
Carol Mann of Redondo Beach, and his parents, William and Lorraine McCune of 
Huntington Harbour.

ANGELS LOSE GRIP AGAINST A'S; 
</P>
<P>
MISTAKES LEAVE THEM DEFENSELESS IN A 9-5 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

OAKLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels arrived here with something to prove and made their point in the 
first two games, defeating the defending American League champion Athletics 
twice and opening a two-game lead in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
But any visions of Angel invincibility disappeared Wednesday at Oakland 
Coliseum with a series of miscues as the A's beat the Angels, 9-5, before 
44,588. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so much that the Angels lost. It was the way they lost. There were 
players arguing with umpires while A's took extra bases. There was poor 
judgment, poor execution. It was not a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only think of two games when we haven't been efficient in the field," 
Manager Doug Rader said. "The first game of the doubleheader in Toronto (when 
the Angels made four errors) and today." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the blundering, the Angels were in a position to win. And had it not 
been for a fine over-the-shoulder catch by Dave Henderson of a drive by Brian 
Downing with the bases loaded in the seventh, they might have come away with a 
sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Angels, who were swept in a three-game series here earlier this 
year, believe they've earned some respect this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Since spring training to this point, nobody thought the California Angels were 
for real," right fielder Claudell Washington said. "They didn't think we could 
compete. They thought we'd come up here and get swept. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had been a little better defensively and played heads up, we would have 
won this game, too. But we're not going to blame anyone. We'll just pick up the 
pieces and keep on going because we believe in ourselves and that's what counts 
most." 
</P>
<P>
It would have been hard to decide on one person to blame anyway. The list of 
candidates was that long. 
</P>
<P>
It all unraveled in the fourth inning, after the Angels had taken a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Parker led off with a bloop single to left that might have been caught, 
but shortstop Dick Schofield and left fielder Chili Davis both hesitated 
momentarily as the ball fell between them. Mark McGwire followed with a double 
to left-center and then Dave Henderson hit a grounder to short that handcuffed 
Schofield, bouncing under his glove as he tried to snatch it out of the air. 
Both Parker and McGwire scored, tying the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
One out later, Ron Hassey singled to right, sending Henderson to third. Then 
Tony Phillips hit a sharp grounder to second that looked to be a sure 
double-play ball, but Johnny Ray chose to throw home. Henderson slid under 
catcher Bill Schroeder's tag and while Schroeder argued with home plate umpire 
Al Clark, Hassey sprinted to third. Mike Gallego flied to right to score Hassey 
and the A's were ahead, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a reaction play," Ray said. "My first reaction was to look at home. I 
saw the runner break and that's where I went. I never second-guess myself." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he wasn't expecting the ball, but he also thought he made the 
tag before Henderson slid across the plate. On a day of mistakes, Schroeder was 
the only Angel to receive an official error, although all he did was hold the 
ball while Hassey took third. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had it to do over again, I'd have called time out first," he said, 
managing a smile. "But by the time you think to call time out, all the fervor 
is gone." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland starter Mike Moore, who gave up six hits in the first three innings, 
seemed to be buoyed by the Oakland outburst and retired 11 in a row between the 
third and seventh innings, six on strikeouts. But when he walked Schofield with 
one out in the seventh, Manager Tony La Russa decided to bring in Rick 
Honeycutt. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored one run on Devon White's single, but then Henderson saved a 
bunch more when he stabbed Downing's drive a step in front of the warning track 
in center. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels tied the score, 5-5, in the eighth on a single, a sacrifice and a 
run-scoring single by Schofield, but the A's blew the game open in the bottom 
of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Mike Witt, whose record dropped to 7-8, gave up singles to McGwire and 
Dave Henderson and Rader summoned Rich Monteleone. Monteleone struck out Jose 
Canseco, but Hassey singled in the go-ahead run and another scored on a 
fielder's choice when Jack Howell decided to try for a double play instead of 
getting a sure out at the plate. Rickey Henderson drove in another with a 
single off Howell's chest, and Lansford made it 9-5 with a run-scoring single 
to center. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a few times this season where everything was going right and 
we put together a good streak," La Russa said. "But more often, we seem to have 
to win a game to stay alive. This was definitely a big game for us." 
</P>
<P>
And it was an important series for the Angels, who, if nothing else, have 
earned the respect of the A's. 
</P>
<P>
"Respect isn't what we're looking for," Davis said. "They can keep their 
respect. We want a division championship." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels lead the major leagues in home runs (93), which was news to 
shortstop Dick Schofield, who hit No. 93 Tuesday night. "I didn't realize we 
were leading until I read it in the paper last week," he said. "We spread out 
our homers pretty good." No Angel is in the top 10 in the league homers, which 
is a big plus, according to catcher Lance Parrish. "There's not really one spot 
in the order they can attack," he said. "Anyone can hit it out, all the way 
through the lineup." Four Angels -- Jack Howell (14), Chili Davis (13), Parrish 
(13) and Claudell Washington (10) -- are in double figures in homers and Brian 
Downing and Devon White have nine apiece. . . . Is a homer-oriented nickname, a 
la Oakland's Bash Brothers, forthcoming for the Angels? "We ain't got no 
names," Davis said. "We're just the Angels." 
</P>
<P>
Washington, who had an outsider's view of the Angels in recent years, thinks 
his new team has come a long way. "If we don't win another game this season, 
we've done a helluva job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos Armas, younger brother of Angel outfielder Tony Armas, is hitting .272 
with one homer and 12 RBIs in 20 games for the A's Southern Oregon rookie 
league team.

MORNING BRIEFING: OILER CAMP IS NOT FAR ENOUGH FROM CIVILIZATION TO SUIT COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Houston Oilers are training in San Marcos, located in the scrub-brush 
country of southwest Texas, and Coach Jerry Glanville said: "You oughta see our 
training room. There's nothing in there but cockroaches." 
</P>
<P>
Glanville wasn't complaining. In fact, he thought it was great. 
</P>
<P>
He told Ed Hinton of the Atlanta Journal: "I've always believed you gotta go 
someplace miserable if you want to come out of camp as a team that can win. You 
gotta have that isolation." 
</P>
<P>
His only complaint about San Marcos is that it's too close to civilization. He 
liked it better when the Oilers trained in San Angelo. 
</P>
<P>
Said Glanville: "A man at a gas station in San Angelo once told me, 'I'd pull 
for you guys if you'd give the ball to Earl Campbell more.' Well, hell, Earl 
hadn't been with us for three years. San Angelo was so far out there, those 
people didn't know us from nothin'." 
</P>
<P>
Endangered species: Ed Schuyler Jr. of the Associated Press, on the possibility 
of a Mike Tyson-George Foreman match: "There is a certain pro wrestling, 
burlesque appeal to Tyson fighting the massive Foreman. There also is the risk 
of the bout being picketed by the Save the Whales Movement." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: According to their nicknames, how would you rank Gary Matthews, 
Ralph Houk and Gene Mauch? 
</P>
<P>
Wasting away?From Terry Boers of the Chicago Sun-Times: "You can talk all you 
want about the 30 pounds that Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda has lost since 
spring training, but the guy looked a lot healthier to me when he was a chubby 
rascal with clam sauce dripping down his chin." 
</P>
<P>
Add Dodgers: Says Atlanta Brave Manager Russ Nixon: "We have one goal for the 
second half, and that's to finish ahead of the Dodgers. Anywhere but last place 
would be a hell of an accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
Taming the Bear: How long is Mark Calcavecchia off the tee? Jack Nicklaus, who 
played with him in the Doral Ryder Open this year, told the New York Times: 
"For the first time, I felt like other guys used to feel when they played with 
me. Mark hit it so hard and so far I felt totally inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: Basketball Coach Jim Valvano of North Carolina State, 
on his marriage: "I thought her name was Lavini and that she was Italian. It 
was Lavine and she was Jewish. She thought because of my big nose I was Jewish. 
We were married for three years before we knew we had a mixed marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Capital ideas: As Tex Schramm searches for European cities to join his global 
football league, Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post suggested these 
entries: "Sofia Lorens and Buda Pests." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago today: In a matchup of 300-game winners, Don Sutton out-dueled 
Tom Seaver, pitching six shutout innings as the Angels beat the Boston Red Sox, 
3-0. 
</P>
<P>
On this date in 1918, Brooklyn pitcher Henry Heitman made his major league 
debut against St. Louis. He gave up four consecutive hits, left the mound and 
never played pro ball again. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: 1. Mauch, the Little General; 2. Houk, Major; 3. Matthews, 
Sarge. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Stan Hochman of the Philadelphia Daily News, noting that a 
Philadelphia high school player received a one-half basketball scholarship to 
Randolph-Macon College: "Does that mean Randolph wanted him, and Macon didn't?"

A CELEBRATED FLORIST'S STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clifford Miller of the Flower Shop has had a busy seven years as florist to the 
stars (his clients include Brandon and Lilly Tartikoff, Kirk Douglas and Johnny 
Carson). From his Los Angeles studio, Miller talked about entertaining styles 
and floral trends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question: What is the process of doing floral arrangements for a large party or 
charity event? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It depends; sometimes the (planning) committee makes a decision before 
I'm brought in, and sometimes I'm brought in immediately. With the American 
Film Institute tribute to Gregory Peck, I actually sat in on the menu 
consultations. We discussed colors, down to what food was going to go with the 
flowers, and how that was going to interpret Gregory Peck. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What flowers did you end up doing for that? 
</P>
<P>
A: Because it was being filmed for TV, we had to keep in mind that certain 
flowers photograph better than others and the flowers had to be kept low on the 
table. We picked a sort of silvery gray tone, with sterling silver roses and 
deep lavender tulips, which showed up as white on TV. It had a nice sheen. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there always so much to consider when doing an arrangement? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, especially now that so many things are taped. I did a beach-themed 
party for the Beach Boys at the Beverly Hilton and did tall palm trees on the 
tables. The first thing the lighting people said when they got there was, "This 
can't happen." So we had to strike half of the palm trees and within four to 
five hours redo the tables. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What kinds of materials do you prefer to work with? 
</P>
<P>
A: I love natural materials and I'm glad to see in home decorating magazines 
that things are turning back to a traditional look. L.A.'s been stuck in this 
mold for a while of having to be bigger and flashier. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When doing a centerpiece, are there rules that you follow? 
</P>
<P>
A: To some extent. There's nothing worse than not being able to see across the 
table. I either like something above eye level or something below. If I'm doing 
a flower tree I'll do something at the base, then flowers at the top. I think 
you get enough when you look past the person you're talking to to the rest of 
the room and can see the flowers on the other tables. And I don't really use 
fragrant flowers unless it's requested. JEANNINE STEIN

YOUR WHEELS: THE HEAT'S ON THE MOST RECENT MODELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My brand-new Chevrolet seems to get hotter after sitting in the 
summer sun than some of my past cars. It's white, like the others, so I don't 
think the color has anything to do with it. Is GM using less insulation or 
something? -- I.P. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The dog days of summer are here again, and modern car designs are 
indeed causing interiors to gain more solar heat than in the past. Modern 
aerodynamic designs feature sloping windows and greater total window area, 
which allows cars to heat up more in the summer sun. It is not uncommon for 
newer cars to reach interior temperatures of 138 degrees after sitting in the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
In part, that is why you are seeing so many motorists equipping their rear and 
side car windows with reflective film, which manufacturers of the product claim 
can cut solar heating by 35% to 65%. If that is true, it reduces the load on 
the air-conditioning system and keeps the car cooler with the air conditioning 
on. (California Highway Patrol asserts it is illegal to use film on windshields 
and front side windows.) 
</P>
<P>
GM has an experimental station in Mesa, Ariz., to test how its mechanical 
systems and materials hold up in intense sunlight and desert heat. Jack 
Jacquette, director of the center, said the increase in glass surface area in 
recent years has led to a lot of research to find better ways to cool down 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
The company is investigating better glass, which will help reflect heat without 
solar-reflective film. They are hoping that a chemical process in making the 
glass will help restrict heat waves from passing through the glass. Motorist 
comfort is not the only reason for the concern. Big loads on air-conditioning 
systems cut fuel economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Extremes of temperature and humidity can impose a 20% penalty on fuel 
economy," he said. "We are deeply involved in better understanding solar 
radiation and temperature effects." 
</P>
<P>
One related area involves the longevity of interior materials, particularly 
upholstery that is subject to serious damage from sunlight. "We are trying to 
perceive in a few months how materials will hold up in five or 10 years," he 
said.

Separately, GM is using computerized models to help develop better 
air-conditioning systems. Using fluid mechanics borrowed from the aircraft 
industry, GM is trying to understand how an air conditioner can be optimized. 
The physical effects under study include examining the effects of air blowing 
from vents, the circulation of hot air masses inside the car, the heat transfer 
effects and the time it takes to cool down a boiling-hot car.

Q: A number of years ago, you wrote a column about how to adjust headlights. It 
worked great, but now I need to do it again and I never kept the column. Could 
you please give me the instructions again? -- S.H. 
</P>
<P>
A: Every state has a vehicle code that specifies how headlights must be aimed 
and where the headlights can be placed on the vehicle. These laws are 
complicated, and performing the adjustments to the letter of the law isn't easy 
for an average motorist. 
</P>
<P>
The code in California, for example, specifies that in a two-headlight system 
the intense portion of the light beam at a distance of 25 feet may not be 
higher than 5 inches below the lamp from which it comes. There are other 
regulations on stray light, fog lights and much else. 
</P>
<P>
Garages with the proper equipment can perform this adjustment so that the light 
beams conform to that standard. 
</P>
<P>
Many garages, though, use a mark on a wall, which may or may not be adequate. 
You could probably do just as well by carefully marking two sets of 
perpendicular lines on your garage door that correspond to your car's headlight 
position. You'd then back up 25 feet and attempt to aim the headlight five 
inches below the center points of the lines.

YOUR COINS: AN INTERNATIONAL PURSUIT TO LEARN COLLECTION'S VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Question: During her lifetime, my mother amassed a small collection of coins. 
Many of them are from foreign countries, including France, Germany, Cuba, 
Ghana, Canada, some of the Scandinavian countries as well as the United 
Kingdom. What is the best way to determine their value? 
</P>
<P>
There are also American coins, pennies and nickels. The oldest coin is an 1876 
French franc, followed by an American nickel dated 1893, and then a 1907 Indian 
head penny from the United States. There is also a sales tax token from Kansas 
and a 1915 Cuban viente centavo. 
</P>
<P>
I have no idea of their value or the value of the rest of the coins. Will you 
advise me on how to proceed? -- S.M. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It's a good idea to have a general idea of what your coins are worth 
before you try to sell them. You can make a major project out of this or treat 
it rather casually, depending upon your dedication. Practically, however, you 
can do a little research and satisfy your curiosity and get an approximation, 
but only a hands-on inspection by a professional numismatist will give you an 
accurate evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
To begin, there are several price guides available. For foreign coins, there's 
the "Standard Catalogue of World Coins" by Krause and Mishler and/or the Simon 
&amp; Schuster "World Coin Catalogue" by Gunter Schon. For American coins, 
there's "A Guide Book of United States Coins" by R. S. Yeoman plus numerous 
pocket-type guides. 
</P>
<P>
Because condition is a key element in pricing coins, you will have to determine 
whether the coins are circulated or uncirculated. The less wear, the greater 
the value. After you've priced your coins, you're liable to discover that 
they're worth considerably less than you'd anticipated. The 1893 nickel, for 
example, is one of more than 13 million minted that year. It catalogues for 
$3.50 in good condition (a very low grade), but you'd be hard-pressed to get $1 
from a dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Which is the next step: finding a dealer who will purchase your coins. Don't 
sell until you are satisfied you have received a fair offer. Check with more 
than one dealer; opinions and prices can vary widely.

Coin Update

<P>
The recent column that mentioned the 1989 no-mint mark quarter drew a negative 
response from Dennis Baker, editor of the Coin Dealer Newsletter, the respected 
numismatic pricing journal. Baker says contrary to other numismatic 
publications, which claim the error coin is worth about $3, some dealers are 
actually offering about $60 for the 25-cent piece. True values of course 
ultimately are settled in the marketplace. Still, the Coin Dealer Newsletter is 
the guide used by most dealers to determine day-to-day pricing. It is published 
weekly, $89 for a one-year subscription, from Coin Dealer Newsletter, P.O. Box 
11099, Torrance, Calif. 90510.

CHACON PROPOSES NEW KING TRIBUTE; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATOR TO SEEK RENAMING PART OF CALIFORNIA 94 FOR RIGHTS LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN and PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Peter Chacon (D-San Diego) will ask the California Legislature to 
name a section of California 94 that runs through Southeast San Diego in honor 
of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Chacon's chief of staff said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came a day after San Diego Unified Port District commissioners 
ended the latest local effort to select a tribute to the slain civil rights 
leader by rejecting, in a 4-3 vote, the City Council's request to place King's 
name on the San Diego Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed renaming of a slice of California 94 is the latest development in 
a divisive, racially charged debate surrounding efforts in San Diego to honor a 
man who is widely hailed as the preeminent figure of the 1960s civil rights 
movement in the United States. Many other cities have paid tribute to King by 
naming roads, streets and buildings in his honor, but similar efforts have run 
aground in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
August Introduction 
</P>
<P>
Whether the highway-renaming idea will engender as much controversy in San 
Diego as two previous and unsuccessful planned tributes to King remains to be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
Irma Munoz, Chacon's chief of staff, said the lawmaker will introduce a 
resolution when the Legislature reconvenes in August requesting the designation 
of a still-undetermined length of California 94, beginning at 16th Street, as 
"Martin Luther King Freeway." The Southeast neighborhood traversed by the 
freeway has large black and Latino populations -- a fact that could become an 
issue, as some activists have voiced a preference for a tribute that would be 
more visible to both the minority and white populations. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor Maureen O'Connor, said the mayor neither 
supports nor opposes the proposal at this point. The City Council, he said, 
must decide what is the appropriate course to take in the controversy, which 
has generated considerable negative publicity nationwide for a city that prides 
itself on its easy-living image. 
</P>
<P>
But, after the racially and politically divisive battles over a King tribute 
that resulted in the defeat of renaming Market Street and the new convention 
center after the slain civil rights leader, the Chacon proposal may provide 
weary council members with a welcome opportunity to put the issue to rest. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the renaming proposal will probably depend on the support of the 
San Diego legislative delegation in Sacramento. The assemblyman's aide said she 
was "hopeful" of approval. A similar proposal is expected to be introduced in 
the state Senate, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Renaming a stretch of California 94 in King's honor was one of the alternatives 
considered by the City Council before a decision was made to name Market Street 
in honor of King -- an action that was eventually reversed by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon began working on the idea in May, his aide said, at the request of 
Bishop George D. McKinney, pastor of St. Stephen's Church of God in Christ. 
But, after consulting black leaders, the legislator held off announcing the 
proposal to avoid giving port commissioners a reason for rejecting the City 
Council-backed proposal to name the convention center in honor of King. 
</P>
<P>
"We were waiting for the Port District," Munoz said. "We did not want the Port 
District to say, 'Well, the state is looking into naming that highway after Dr. 
King, so there is no need for us to do anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejection Cleared Way 
</P>
<P>
However, port commissioners voted Tuesday to reject the convention center 
proposal, clearing the way for the formal disclosure of the idea to dedicate a 
portion of California 94. 
</P>
<P>
A state highway tribute to King, Munoz said, does not relieve the council and 
other area officials of the responsibility to find a tribute to King or address 
the racial tensions stirred by more than three years of protracted debate 
surrounding the memorial issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because the state of California assumes leadership and feels it's a 
priority . . . does not mean that it should be the only tribute," Munoz said. 
"There's more to this issue than just naming a highway, or a building, or a 
city street after Dr. King." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for Chacon's choice of California 94, Munoz confirmed, was 
the fact that a state legislative decision cannot be overturned by a local 
referendum. In 1987, San Diego voters overwhelmingly overturned the council's 
decision to rename Market Street as Martin Luther King Jr. Way. In this case, 
Munoz said, a statewide referendum would be needed to overturn a legislative 
act.

OCEANSIDE MAY BE IN ON-DECK CIRCLE FOR MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has the makings of a smash hit: There's this handsome movie star, and he has 
this vision. A vision of baseball. A vision of creating his own team and his 
own ball field from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
An empty cornfield would come in handy about now. 
</P>
<P>
But no. The best the city of Oceanside can come up with on short notice is an 
old city dump, and that just isn't going to cut it, as far as romantic notions 
go. 
</P>
<P>
The dream of minor league baseball in Oceanside will not die easily, however, 
despite the lack of a suitable site for a stadium. A group of minor league 
baseball owners, led by Encinitas attorney Barry Axelrod and actor Mark Harmon, 
has embarked on a quest to make that dream a reality. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark and I would like to do it again somewhere, and I'd love it to be in 
Oceanside, because it's basically home for me," said Axelrod, who, besides 
being an attorney, is also an agent for professional athletes, including 
baseball players. His old college chum is Harmon, voted "The Sexiest Man Alive" 
by the readers of People magazine two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod said that, 10 years ago, he and Harmon played softball and basketball 
together at UCLA. "We always said we'd love to own a minor league ball team," 
Axelrod said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broke 40-Year Attendance Record 
</P>
<P>
The pair made it happen in 1987 when they, along with other investors, 
purchased the franchise for the Ventura Gulls and moved the team to San 
Bernardino. There the new San Bernardino Spirit has met with phenomenal success 
-- in its first year the team broke a 40-year-old California League attendance 
record by drawing more than 161,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by their success, Axelrod, Harmon and the other investors began 
considering acquiring another team. While the California League now consists of 
10 teams, most of those have traditionally been clustered in the Central Valley 
and Northern California. "We think there's room for one or two other teams down 
here in Southern California," Axelrod said. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino, Riverside and Palm Springs are the only Southern California 
cities with minor league teams. Santa Barbara, Ontario, Upland, Hesperia and 
Long Beach are among those under consideration by Axelrod and his co-investors, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But, when we looked at Oceanside, we felt that the demographics, the size, the 
population were very similar to what had worked for us in San Bernardino," he 
said. San Diego County also seemed the ideal location because no other minor 
league team exists here, not since the Padres went big-league in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod said the investors are not worried that the proximity of the Padres 
would siphon off baseball fans, since the residents of North County tend to 
have a separate identity from the city of San Diego. In fact, six of the 10 
ballparks in the California League are within 90 miles of a major league club, 
and it hasn't hurt them any, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the minor leagues are a whole different ballgame. "It costs a fraction 
of what it costs to go see a major league team, and there's a real camaraderie, 
a sense of civic pride in the team," Axelrod said. "It's just a whole different 
way of enjoying baseball." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explosion in Asking Price 
</P>
<P>
A recent explosion in the asking price of minor league franchises has put the 
cost for both would-be owners and host cities in a whole different ballpark as 
well. Three years ago, the average Class A franchise could be acquired for less 
than $250,000, according to a study done by Oceanside's recreation department. 
Now owners are paying upward of $600,000, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
Recreation director Patrick Sanchez attributed the boom to celebrities such as 
Harmon getting into the act and driving up the price. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, minor league baseball is becoming quite the thing among Hollywood 
types," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think it's partly because of the success we've had in San 
Bernardino," Axelrod said. "We got into it because it was fun; now it's 
economically viable. A lot of people are saying this is the investment of the 
'80s." 
</P>
<P>
But the investment goes only so far, as Oceanside is learning. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're looking at putting between $600,000 and a million into the 
franchise, I don't think we can also be expected to build the ballpark," 
Axelrod said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's study bore out its worst fears: Most minor league teams play in 
stadiums that were purchased, built or renovated by their host cities. Although 
the terms of the agreement vary from city to city, the franchise generally 
leases the stadium from the city, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Great If You Like Methane 
</P>
<P>
The obvious location in Oceanside would be Recreation Park on Maxson Street, 
where the city's Little League team plays. The City Council, inspired by the 
proposal by Harmon's group of investors in May, asked the city's recreation 
director to look into the feasibility of it all. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Sanchez found that the park, built on top of an old city dump, 
has some possibly insurmountable problems. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the ground has a way of settling a few inches each year -- up to 
a foot or more in especially rainy years. Also, there's the matter of the 
methane gas produced underground by the decaying garbage. 
</P>
<P>
City officials feel that the gas problem has been solved with a system of wells 
that extract and pump it to a collection tank, but those features would have to 
be incorporated into the stadium. Also, the site is probably not large enough 
to accommodate the minimum of 3,500 seats and 1,200 parking spaces required by 
the California League, the recreation department study found. 
</P>
<P>
Renovation of Recreation Park to minor league standards would cost in the 
neighborhood of $1.5 million to $3 million, the study concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, without comment, accepted the findings of Sanchez's study 
Wednesday, and chose to move forward with only the improvements necessary to 
keep the current ballpark up to par, including irrigation and a new scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Possible Sites 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of renovation is prohibitive," Sanchez acknowledged after the council 
meeting. In fact, for $3 million, the city could build a brand-new facility 
that could be used for minor league baseball and many other things as well, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, he said, there are other possible sites for a new stadium within the 
city limits, including a 26-acre chunk of undeveloped open space known as 
Sherbourne Park, in the city's eastern reaches. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said he thinks that the city will continue to be interested in hosting 
a minor league team, but that the shocking reality of the required financial 
investment may keep things on the back burner for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Harmon and company are in any hurry. "There are no teams for sale in 
the California League right now anyway," Axelrod said. "Besides, there are a 
lot of elements that have to come together first. . . . We've gotten a lot of 
credit for putting on a real first-class show in San Bernardino, and I don't 
think we'd want to do it any other way."

SANTEE COUNCILMAN PUSHES PROPOSAL TO PROTECT THE ATMOSPHERE

<TEXT>
<P>
Santee, the East County community that has, perhaps unfairly, earned a 
reputation for being a rough and raw cowboy town, is considering a move that 
could put it on the cutting edge of environmental law. 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposal by Councilman James Bartell, this city of 51,000 people could 
be the first in San Diego County to enact an ordinance to restrict compounds 
that are destroying the Earth's protective ozone layer. On Wednesday, the City 
Council postponed taking any direct action on the proposal, saying it wants 
more time to study the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Bartell had wanted the council to ask the city staff to draft a measure within 
60 days that would restrict the use and production of chlorofluorocarbons -- or 
CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
Bartell, who described himself as a "longtime environmentalist," said that he 
wants Santee to pattern its ordinance after a measure approved earlier this 
month by the Irvine City Council. The Irvine ordinance is said to be the most 
comprehensive of its kind in the nation and will become effective on July 1, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
But Santee council members said Wednesday night that they wanted to analyze 
Irvine's innovative ordinance in more detail before taking any action. 
</P>
<P>
Besides fast-food restaurants that use some Styrofoam food containers, the 
measure would affect the construction, manufacturing, refrigeration and 
air-conditioning industries. The ordinance would prohibit the use and sale of 
some insulation products. Refrigeration and air-conditioning repair shops would 
also be required to recycle Freon and prevent its release into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bartell, the depletion of the ozone layer has been a personal 
concern for a long time. As a staff aide to Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego), 
Bartell said, he has worked on several environmental issues and legislation 
supported by the congressman. 
</P>
<P>
Bartell conceded that he does not know how many businesses in Santee would be 
affected by the proposed ordinance, and he acknowledged that the proposal has 
so far received a lukewarm response from other council members. 
</P>
<P>
"The feedback I'm getting is that this is a federal issue, and we should let 
the federal government deal with it," said Bartell. "I don't buy that. What the 
federal government has done is to set standards for industry in general and for 
regions and cities to meet. It's going to be local government's role to ensure 
that clean air standards are met." 
</P>
<P>
He said that his detractors have shown "a lack of understanding of the issue." 
"It's not going to harm anyone," said Bartell. "It's intended to improve 
everyone's quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
But Teresa McTighe, executive director of the Santee Chamber of Commerce, 
argued that "you need the broadest jurisdiction available" in order for the 
ordinance to be effective. The federal government is in a better position to 
protect the ozone layer and should conduct further studies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that it's such a significant issue the federal government should be 
the appropriate agency to implement a law. Depletion of the ozone layer is an 
issue that has worldwide impact. . . . If it's bad, it's bad for everybody, not 
just Santee," said McTighe. 
</P>
<P>
Bartell's proposal has not received much response from the merchants who run 
the estimated 2,000 businesses in Santee, McTighe said. "Not very many 
merchants are aware of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both McTighe and Cynthia Vicknair, executive assistant to San Diego City 
Councilwoman Judy McCarty, noted that there already are some foam containers 
made from compounds that are not harmful to the environment. However, both 
women and Bartell said that finding safe alternatives for fluorocarbons 
presents a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, there are no alternatives to Freon for air conditioning," said 
Bartell. "Hopefully, the industry will find alternatives to Freon and other 
dangerous fluorocarbons." 
</P>
<P>
Vicknair said that McCarty and other San Diego council members have asked the 
city manager to work with the Air Pollution Control District and industry 
representatives to prepare a plan to reduce emissions of CFCs in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Jurisdictional boundaries make enforcement of ordinances like the one enacted 
in Irvine almost impossible, said Vicknair. "What we need is federal and state 
conformity here in order to put teeth in these laws. . . . If we enacted a 
similar ordinance in San Diego, what would stop somebody from El Cajon from 
bringing a harmful foam container to the beach? Enforcement would be very, very 
difficult," she said.

POLL BY DOCTOR SHOWS MDS OBJECT TO TACTICS OF ABORTION PROTESTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like many doctors, Christopher Khoury had remained mostly silent in the 
continuing debate over abortion. But the Escondido psychiatrist took a step 
toward activism shortly after 130 demonstrators were arrested during a July 8 
anti-abortion protest at a Poway women's clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Khoury, an acquaintance of the doctor targeted during that protest, decided to 
poll Palomar Medical Center's 252 staff doctors on the increasing targeting of 
medical facilities for anti-abortion protests. 
</P>
<P>
Khoury persuaded 20 fellow staff members at Palomar to circulate a memo that 
calls for "the police and courts to respond humanely but promptly and 
effectively to bring this form of violence to a halt." The memo described 
abortion protests held at medical offices and clinics as "totally 
inappropriate" behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Of 162 doctors who responded to the memo, 85% agreed that the emotionally 
charged protests illegally infringe upon the private relationship enjoyed by 
doctors and patients. More than 10% abstained, but only 3% voiced outright 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the doctors who agreed with Khoury requested anonymity, but 81 agreed 
to make their objections publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors, who traditionally have remained silent on many public issues, "are 
very sensitive about privacy and the patient-doctor relationship," Khoury said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Khoury described recent abortion demonstrations as "relatively minor irritants" 
to most physicians. But "the debate over abortion is going to occur much more 
publicly" following the recent Supreme Court ruling, Khoury said. 
</P>
<P>
"The proper forum for the debate is not the doctor's waiting 
</P>
<P>
room," Khoury said. "There have to be some rules as to how that debate will 
take place." 
</P>
<P>
William Boyce, a surgeon who has practiced in Escondido for 35 years, supported 
Khoury because "you just don't enter people's properties (to) harass and 
interrupt . . . what's going on. That's a most serious infraction." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors might feel more comfortable remaining silent, but "they are affected by 
all of the laws and social trends as much as everyone else," Boyce said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Khoury was drawn into the growing public debate when 130 abortion protesters 
were arrested after demonstrating at a Poway women's clinic operated by Dr. 
Bruce J. Tarzy,a former Poway mayor. Tarzy, through a spokeswoman, on Wednesday 
declined to comment on the informal survey because he had not yet seen the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Khoury undertook the petition drive because "having public support like this 
would mean a lot to physicians who have been victimized" by demonstrations. 
Khoury described those doctors as being "harassed and essentially kidnaped" by 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
"Those doctors go through hell," Boyce said. "They're in their private office, 
and it's not a public building." He said the demonstrators are disturbing "a 
very tender relationship between doctors and patients." 
</P>
<P>
As a psychiatrist, Khoury has on several occasions counseled women who were 
considering abortions to end what he described as pregnancies surrounded by 
"tragic circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
"I shared the difficult decisions they go through," Khoury said. "I believe 
that . . . the woman should be making that decision without being harassed." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokesman Alain Jourdier said Wednesday that Khoury acted in an 
unofficial capacity when he polled staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the San Diego Medical Society announced that it "strongly 
objects" to anti-abortion rallies being staged outside medical offices and 
clinics. The society, which represents 2,800 of the county's 6,000 doctors, 
"cannot condone . . . recent attempts to harass patients or prevent them from 
seeking treatment," medical society President Lynn Sheffey said Monday.

LAWNDALE CONSIDERS SUING HAWTHORNE OVER MATTEL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawndale city officials say they are considering legal action against the city 
of Hawthorne over a large redevelopment project approved this week by the 
Hawthorne City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute centers on the 36-acre "Mattel Project," which involves revamping 
and expanding Mattel Inc.'s corporate headquarters near Rosecrans Avenue and 
the San Diego Freeway. The giant toy maker once manufactured products there, 
including its popular Barbie dolls, but moved its manufacturing operations 
overseas years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other developments, including a hotel, two restaurants, and retail 
and office buildings, are also planned as part of the $150-million project, 
which is expected ultimately to generate millions of new tax dollars for 
Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's Hawthorne City Council meeting, Lawndale Mayor Sarann Kruse urged 
council members to delay approving a development agreement for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse took Hawthorne council members to task, saying planners had failed to 
determine the combined environmental impacts that the Mattel project and 
another Hawthorne redevelopment project less than a mile away would have on 
Lawndale. The second project, which includes a 28-acre parcel on the east side 
of the San Diego Freeway, is in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse urged council members not to make a decision until officials from 
Lawndale and Hawthorne had an opportunity to sit down together and study the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We are coming to see it is not possible for the city of Lawndale to solve its 
problems in isolation," Kruse said. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse outlined her objections in a lengthy letter she delivered to Hawthorne 
council members just minutes before their 7 p.m. meeting. She was accompanied 
by an attorney from the law firm that regularly represents Lawndale on legal 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne council members did not address Kruse and offered little public 
comment before approving on a 4-0 vote an agreement with Comstock, Crosser and 
Hickey Development Co., based in Manhattan Beach. Councilman David York was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Kruse said Lawndale council members will meet Aug. 6 to discuss 
whether to file suit against Hawthorne. She declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Mayor Betty Ainsworth said in an interview that Kruse's letter and 
appearance before the council came as a surprise to her and her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like we had everything together and ready to go and then, boom!" she 
said. "They could have written us a letter; they could have phoned us and said, 
'We would like to meet with you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ainsworth said plans for the Mattel project have been in the works for two 
years, and that Hawthorne officials had met on several occasions with Lawndale 
to discuss the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we were addressing their concerns," she said. "And we will continue 
working with them." 
</P>
<P>
Ainsworth said that even though the city is now negotiating with a developer 
for the second redevelopment project, the deal could fall through. The proposal 
includes more retail development as well as townhouses and condominiums. If the 
second project does move forward, the cumulative environmental impacts of it 
and the Mattel project will be studied by planners, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other Hawthorne city officials said proper procedures had been followed in 
preparing the environmental report for the Mattel project, including its 
impacts on Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
For example, because of the increased traffic congestion the project is 
expected to bring, a $1.5-million fund has been established to improve nearby 
roadways, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Comstock, managing partner of the development company, said obtaining quick 
approval for the project from council members was essential. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the company's plan hinges on five pending agreements, one of which 
allows a property owner to pull out if escrow on his parcel does not close by 
September. "For us to hit our deadlines, it was really important for us to move 
forward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary plans call for the construction of two restaurants, at least one 
hotel, numerous retail buildings and up to 500,000 square feet of office space. 
</P>
<P>
The project would also allow Mattel, which owns seven acres of land in the 
redevelopment area, to consolidate its offices and do away with space once 
reserved for manufacturing. The company's existing six-story building will be 
remodeled, and another low-rise office building will be built. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation has developed into an inefficient one for us," Mattel spokesman 
Glenn Bozarth said. "Our needs are very different today than they were in the 
'50s and '60s when we first occupied the land." 
</P>
<P>
The entire redevelopment project is expected to be completed by 1996 and to 
bring the city up to $2 million annually in new revenue, according to Bud 
Cormier, Hawthorne's assistant director of redevelopment.

TV'S 'PEOPLE'S COURT' LOSES IN REAL TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The producers of the television show "People's Court," who have dispensed 
justice daily in their televised courtroom for eight years, are tasting the 
frustration that can come from being in front of -- rather than behind -- the 
judicial bench. 
</P>
<P>
A real Small Claims Court judge has ruled that Ralph Edwards Productions must 
pay Louis De George, 62, of Van Nuys, $1,500 -- even though he lost his case 
when he appeared on "People's Court" in February. 
</P>
<P>
"Our reaction is the same as some of the reactions of the people who walk out 
of our courtroom -- disbelief," said Phillip Vandervort, associate producer of 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
De George took "People's Court" to court last week because he felt that he was 
misled when he agreed to appear on the show. De George said he was told that 
regardless of the ruling by "People's Court" Judge Joseph Wapner, who presides 
over the court-like proceedings, he would receive a $250 appearance fee plus 
the $1,500 in damages he was seeking from his landlord. 
</P>
<P>
But the show's policy is to guarantee damage payments only to litigants who win 
their cases, Vandervort said. Wapner ruled that De George had insufficient 
evidence to prove that his apartment manager's 11-year-old son smashed the 
rear-view mirror on De George's pickup truck and regularly played on the 
vehicle despite warnings not to. 
</P>
<P>
Five months later, however, De George had sufficient evidence to convince Los 
Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Linda Elliott that the show's producers 
had misrepresented their payment policy to him. 
</P>
<P>
In court, De George played a taped message left on his answering machine by a 
"People's Court" researcher, Richard Velasquez, who regularly scanned small 
claims suits filed downtown in search of interesting cases. On the tape, 
Velasquez, who no longer works for the show but appeared in court as a witness, 
promised "a guaranteed $1,500 as well as $250" if De George appeared on the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard left out the words 'if you win,' " Vandervort said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite four witnesses from Ralph Edwards Productions who said they clearly 
explained the policy in subsequent meetings, Elliott ruled that De George was 
entitled to the $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Although she scanned copies of the contracts De George and other litigants sign 
before appearing, the judge said they were confusing and did not clarify the 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plaintiff Elated 
</P>
<P>
"I was elated," said De George, who was notified of his victory by mail 
Tuesday. "They are big shots in the movie industry and television industry, so 
this was really like David against Goliath." 
</P>
<P>
Vandervort said the show's producers are deciding whether they will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"People's Court" is not a legal court of law. Although Wapner was an appointed 
judge, he is retired and on the program acts only as an arbitrator. When 
litigants appear on the program, they sign contracts agreeing not to take their 
cases to a real court afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs as well as defendants receive the $250 appearance fee. The producers 
pay the damages if the plaintiff wins, freeing the defendants of financial 
responsibility.

COUNTY SAYS NO TO TIGHTER RESTRICTIONS ON LOPEZ CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
REFUSAL DEFIES STATE BOARD, LEAVES DUMP'S FATE IN LIMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defying a request by the California Waste Management Board, Los Angeles County 
refused Wednesday to toughen restrictions on trash dumping at Lopez Canyon 
Landfill, owned by the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The state board said Tuesday that a county order -- issued Friday -- was too 
lenient and needed to be amended. It asked the county to agree Wednesday to 
enforce a stricter order by the end of the week against the northeast San 
Fernando Valley dump. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Judith A. Fries said Wednesday that the county believes 
that its current order is sufficient. Anything stricter would "force closure of 
the landfill, at least for a short time," she said. "The county just doesn't 
believe that closing the landfill right now is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Peck, state board spokesman, said board members did not learn of the 
county's refusal until late Wednesday and had not decided how they will 
respond. "One of the options is that we could issue an order ourselves," Peck 
said. "One would be just to let it go and see what happens in court." 
</P>
<P>
City, county and state officials agree that the landfill's fate likely will be 
decided in Los Angeles Superior Court, where the city is fighting the 
restrictions. The next hearing is scheduled Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State of Flux 
</P>
<P>
The future of Lopez Canyon, which accepts two-thirds of the city's residential 
garbage, has been in a state of flux since July 7, when the state board first 
asked the county to scale back trash dumping to levels referred to in the 
dump's 1978 permit. The county Department of Health Services oversees the dump 
as the state's local enforcement agency. 
</P>
<P>
The county maintains that there is no immediate health threat at Lopez Canyon, 
despite complaints from nearby residents that noxious fumes from the dump waft 
into their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The state does not want to accept the section of the county's order that allows 
the city to continue operating under guidelines of a 1983 engineering report 
while applying for a new permit. The state wanted instead to force the city to 
comply with the 1978 limits in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
The city's legal challenge to the state order hinges on whether the 1983 
report, under which the dump has been operated for six years, is legally part 
of the permit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Trucks 
</P>
<P>
Although reinstituting 1978 permit limitations would cause several changes in 
present operations -- including cutting back the number of trucks allowed to 
dump at the landfill and reducing the area that can be used for dumping -- the 
most crucial difference from the city's perspective is a height restriction. 
</P>
<P>
The 1978 permit calls for keeping the landfill below a 1,725-foot elevation, 
while the 1983 report allows it to reach more than 1,740 feet. The dump already 
exceeds 1,760 feet in some sections. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that keeping the height below 1,725 feet will cause the dump 
to be declared full by the end of next year, leading to its closing well in 
advance of a projected 1992 closure date. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors will vote Tuesday on a proposal by Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich that the city dump be closed immediately if it does not obey the 
state restrictions.

TORRANCE FLAG FLAP LEAVES OWNER LESS THAN HALF A STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Torrance City Planning Commission voted two months ago to have David 
Shaw reduce the height of the flagpole in his front yard from 51 feet to 24 
feet, Shaw decided to appeal the decision to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Now he wishes he had left well enough alone. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to testimony from Shaw's neighbors in the hilly middle-class 
Hollywood Riviera neighborhood, the Council voted 5 to 1 Tuesday to make him 
reduce the pole's height to 14 feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not What I Had in Mind' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very upset about this," the 35-year-old contractor said after the 
decision. Shaw said he would have settled for a 24-foot flagpole, but a 14-foot 
pole "is just not what I had in mind for a flagpole." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'll have to get a crane and take down the pole," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight neighbors testified before the council. Four said the flagpole blocks 
their view of the ocean, and the sound of the flapping flag bothers them. The 
other four said they support Shaw and think the flagpole adds style to the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The flagpole controversy came before the Planning Commission in May because the 
pole violates city height limits and because Shaw never applied for the 
required flag permit. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tim Mock said a 24-foot flagpole is not compatible with the 
surrounding single-family, residential neighborhood. He recommended that the 
pole be reduced to 14 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Applegate agreed. He said he supports Shaw's right to fly the 
American flag but added: "We should not ignore the people who are affected." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan Walker, who provided the sole vote in support of Shaw, said he 
drove around the neighborhood this weekend and did not think the flagpole is 
too much of an obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Salvaged From School 
</P>
<P>
Shaw bought the pole last year for $75 from a contractor who salvaged it from 
an elementary school that was being demolished. He erected the pole in December 
and promptly decorated it for the Christmas season with 1,500 colored lights, 
which he said could be seen for miles. 
</P>
<P>
After the lights were taken down, he flew an 8-by-12-foot American flag from 
the pole. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said he didn't know he needed a permit for the flagpole and didn't think 
it would be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
But since April, City Hall has received several letters and petitions, both 
supporting and opposing Shaw's flagpole. One letter of support said: "GO FLAG! 
GO USA! GO XMAS!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Patriotic' 
</P>
<P>
During testimony at the City Council meeting, Shaw said he bought the flagpole 
because it "is very important to me. I'm very patriotic and really enjoy 
getting into Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Weil, a nearby resident on Via Pasqual, said the issue is not patriotism. 
"A 51-foot pole just has no place in a residential area, I feel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Weil said the pole dominates the landscape and blocks her view. She added that 
she was bothered by the colored lights Shaw put up during the Christmas season 
because they shone into her house. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalie Woodward, who lives a few doors away from Shaw on Via Mesa Grande, said 
she opposes the flagpole because it could set a precedent for other neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
One of Shaw's supporters, Jean Vanderleest, who lives on Via Los Miradores, 
said: "We love the flag. We don't know why someone didn't do this sooner. It's 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Katy Geissert sided with the opponents. "I think it's a fine symbol," 
she said, "but it's in the wrong place."

Witnesses will be allowed to testify about a series of incidents in which the 
Torrance Police Department allegedly covered up complaints by citizens of 
drunkenness, sexual assault and other abuses by police officers, a judge ruled 
this week at the start of a massive civil trial in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Abby Soven's rulings mean that the case of Rastello vs. the city of 
Torrance will become an exhaustive review of the Torrance Police Department and 
not simply an examination of the fatal 1984 traffic collision that was the 
impetus for the case. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's action was applauded by John Rastello of San Pedro, who filed suit 
in 1984 after his son, Kelly, 19, was killed in a traffic collision with 
Torrance Police Sgt. Rollo Green, who was off-duty at the time. The suit 
charges that Green caused the accident because he was drunk and made an illegal 
left turn, and that other Torrance police officers covered up for him. The suit 
alleges that such cover-ups are common in the Torrance Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing Green and the city will begin their opening arguments in 
the case this morning. They have denied all the allegations and said that it 
was Rastello's excessive speed along Rolling Hills Road in Torrance that caused 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
By the time jury selection began Tuesday, Soven had already established the 
outline for the case with nearly 40 rulings on a series of legal questions. The 
judge blitzed through the motions in less than five hours, scolding lawyers 
when she felt their arguments took too long. 
</P>
<P>
The judge rejected requests by lawyers for Green and the city to limit the 
scope of the trial to the events immediately surrounding the night of the 
accident, Aug. 30, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'About a Cover-Up' 
</P>
<P>
"This case is not about a failure to arrest" Sgt. Green, Soven told defense 
lawyers. "It is about a cover-up." When the lawyers persisted in their 
arguments, Soven snapped: "I still believe the defense doesn't know what this 
case is about." 
</P>
<P>
Soven said she will permit testimony about previous incidents in which the 
Torrance Police Department allegedly covered up alcohol abuse and crimes 
committed by police officers. She said the allegations are important in the 
case, not on their own merits, but in order to give Rastello's lawyers an 
opportunity to prove their theory that Torrance officers routinely fail to 
investigate their peers or file accurate reports on them. 
</P>
<P>
But Soven said she would limit the testimony. "We're not going to try this case 
all year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Panish, one of Rastello's lawyers, had said he wanted to use 50 incidents 
to prove that the Torrance Police Department has a "pattern and practice" of 
failing to investigate its officers, but the judge said she would permit 
testimony on just 25 incidents. And the plaintiffs can discuss another 15 
incidents in which the department allegedly did not file accurate reports of 
citizen complaints against its officers, Soven ruled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Case in Three Parts 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Green and the city had also argued that the case should be divided 
into three parts: one trial to decide who was at fault in the accident, the 
second to assess whether Torrance officers covered up for Green and the third 
to determine whether cover-ups are routine in the Torrance Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said that testimony on any one of those issues would unfairly cloud 
the jury's judgment on the others. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the judge said that in order to assess the city's liability she 
would permit testimony about how much other officers knew about Green's alleged 
alcoholism and what the department did to treat it. But Soven said the jury 
would be instructed not to let such testimony influence its decision about 
whether Green was drunk on the night of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Green's lawyers argued that this was too much to expect of jurors and that the 
issues should be tried separately. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Single Trial 
</P>
<P>
But Soven rejected such arguments, ruling that the jury will hear all the 
issues during a single trial. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be devastating to us," Will J. Pirkey, Green's attorney, said 
of the ruling. "We think it's extremely prejudicial. We are very concerned." 
Casey Yim, one of the attorneys representing the city, agreed that the ruling 
was a setback but said he was pleased that the judge had limited the testimony 
that would be permitted alleging cover-ups. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs and defense have been involved in an intense legal struggle for 
more than a year over what documents the Police Department should produce for 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
The city's lawyers fought during pretrial hearings against releasing much of 
the material requested by Rastello. Two judges had to be specially appointed to 
hear the legal arguments and one, retired Superior Court Judge John K. Trotter, 
twice sanctioned the city -- with penalties totaling $15,000 -- for failing to 
produce documents. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Torrance officials said they turned over more than 500,000 pages, 
mostly on Police Department practices and past instances of misconduct.

PENINSULA SCHOOL BOARD MAY KEEP MIRALESTE OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Peninsula school board, in a move aimed at ending the long and 
bitter battle over whether the district should be split, has offered to keep 
Miraleste High School open on the condition that students be allowed to enroll 
in the high school of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
"We are offering to keep the school open with the added expense that brings to 
bring this issue to resolution," school board President Jeffrey Younggren said 
in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Let's see if this works. Let's stop the debate." 
</P>
<P>
Two leaders of the East Peninsula Education Council (EPEC), the parents' group 
that has favored seceding from the district since the board decided in late 
1987 to close Miraleste because of declining enrollment, greeted the offer with 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issues to Resolve 
</P>
<P>
However, both said a number of specific issues would have to be resolved before 
the offer could become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are really serious about settling and they want to keep Miraleste 
open, it is exciting," Tom Jankovich, the group's chairman, said. "It is about 
time they came to their senses." 
</P>
<P>
Jankovich said EPEC members will discuss the offer tonight. Nancy Mahr, 
spokeswoman for the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, said the 
matter will be discussed at the board's next meeting Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 4 to 1 Monday to put forth the compromise. Marlys Kinnel voted 
against the compromise offer, saying more time was needed to study its 
ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
The board's peace offering comes less than two weeks after the State Board of 
Education issued a split decision on whether voters should be allowed to 
determine if a new district should be formed. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-3 vote, the board lined up against the idea, but six votes are needed 
before the panel's decisions are binding. The board is scheduled to hear the 
matter again in September. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the state panel had voted in favor of district officials, Miraleste 
would have remained open for the term that starts this fall under a court order 
overturning the decision to close the school. 
</P>
<P>
The court order mandated that the school district produce an environmental 
impact report on school closings throughout the district. The district is in 
the process of preparing that report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Urged Action 
</P>
<P>
Mahr said the board's action this week was prompted by several state board 
members, who indicated they would like to see some movement on the part of 
either the local board or EPEC members in resolving the issue. 
</P>
<P>
State board member Kenneth Peters, who favors the district's position, said 
that whenever the board fails to issue a ruling, it is always the group's 
"intent" that the opposing sides go back and try to work out the dispute among 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It is always much more desirable to try to work out a compromise," Peters 
said, "to try to take a re-look. . . . Nothing would make me happier than to 
learn they worked it out at the local level." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter mailed to Jankovich this week, Younggren wrote that the district 
was willing to maintain an "active high school program at Miraleste if EPEC is 
willing to accept a proposal of open enrollment throughout the district 
allowing students to choose the school they want to go to." 
</P>
<P>
"With this proposal," the letter continued, "it is clear that students who want 
a small high school experience can do so while those who hope to experience a 
more comprehensive program are given that option as well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Students 
</P>
<P>
Besides Miraleste, the district operates two other high schools in Rolling 
Hills Estates and Palos Verdes Estates. Miraleste, with 632 students registered 
for next year, has less than half the student population of either of the other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Jankovich said that while the compromise offer is appealing, he doesn't believe 
an open enrollment policy would be good for the coming year. Miraleste should 
be given a chance to prove it can be successful and hopefully attract pupils 
from nearby private schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Gibbs, EPEC's corporate secretary, said many unanswered questions remain 
with regard to the open enrollment issue. For example, it is unclear whether 
just freshmen would have the right to choose which high school they want to 
attend, or whether the policy would extend to all students. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Gibbs said that before the compromise would be acceptable, board 
members would likely be asked to give some guarantee that Miraleste would 
remain open, providing a certain number of students remain in the school and 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Gibbs termed the board's offer a step in the right direction in 
resolving the acrimonious issue. "We are not going to sit on our hands and let 
the opportunity pass," he said.

CHEVRON WORKERS TERMINATED IN DRUG USE PROBE AT REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A company investigation of drug use at the Chevron refinery in El Segundo has 
led to the termination of eight Chevron employees and 11 employees of a 
contractor being barred from working at the sprawling facility, a company 
spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Private investigators hired by the oil firm in early July uncovered the use of 
small amounts of cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana, according to Chevron 
spokesman Rod Spackman. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we received this information, we felt it was important to act 
quickly and promptly. This all developed in the space of a couple weeks," said 
Spackman. 
</P>
<P>
The Chevron employees, who had worked at the refinery from one to 13 years, 
were either maintenance or security personnel, he said. None of the workers, 
who were paid from $9.50 to $16 an hour, were supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was announced in a July 20 memorandum to all employees from 
Mike Holmes, general manager of the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the results of this investigation, several employees are no longer 
employed by the company and a number of contractor employees are no longer 
permitted to work at our plant," Holmes said in the memo. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy prohibits the use, possession, sale, purchase or distribution of 
illegal drugs or controlled substances on company property." 
</P>
<P>
Spackman declined to identify the employees, the contracting firm or the 
investigators. Chevron officials have briefed El Segundo police about the 
investigation but no arrests were made, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron has agreed to pay up to $20,000 for drug treatment for each former 
employee. Spackman declined to say whether the employees were fired or 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron requires drug tests of all new hires and of employees that management 
suspects of drug use. Employees with drug or alcohol problems are encouraged to 
seek treatment on a confidential basis.

MURALIST PAINTS FACE OF HOPE FOR YOUTH; 
</P>
<P>
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. ELEMENTARY IS GETTING IMAGE OF ITS NAMESAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid drug deals and gang fights in Southeast San Diego, an artist is trying to 
keep the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream alive. 
</P>
<P>
At Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, Eddie Edwards of San Diego is 
painting a two-story-high mural that he says will help show children that they 
can turn their own dreams into reality. 
</P>
<P>
King's face is the focal point of the mural, which is being painted on the east 
wall of the school's auditorium. Below him, children of different races play 
with building blocks with the words friendship, love, peace and we shall 
overcome inscribed on them. Edwards says he hopes the mural will make a 
stronger impression on the children than do the drug deals that take place 
around the school. 
</P>
<P>
"If you touch hands with the youth, you touch hands with the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards sees art as an alternative to drugs and crime and explained that he 
decided to portray King in the mural in the hope that children will see they 
can follow the slain civil rights leader's dream to improve their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The mural, which Edwards started in late June, faces the school playground at 
31st Street, where he said drug dealers stand during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Flowers, a teacher at the school, said she too hopes that King's positive 
image will turn the children away from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Several children have already shown interest in the mural and have helped 
Edwards with it, listening to him talk about King and what the painting 
represents. The children are part of a special summer class geared toward 
raising the level of achievement of black youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The mural was made possible as part of a $3-million gift by art patron Muriel 
Gluck to the San Diego Unified School District in 1988. The gift was 
distributed between the district's 107 elementary schools and five middle 
schools to fund the "Young at Art" program. 
</P>
<P>
The program was designed to introduce the visual arts to the city's children 
with the help of several local artists and the San Diego Museum of Art, which 
received $1 million from the donation. Edwards was hired by the San Diego 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The school's name, which was changed in 1984 from Stockton Elementary, also 
played a big role in deciding on the theme for the mural, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of heroes in the community, but, if people don't give you 
your monuments and statues, you have to make your own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Completion of the mural is scheduled for late August.

HAZARDOUS INTERSECTION IN P.V. ESTATES TO BE REBUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN JOHNSON, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Estates City Council has awarded a $555,207 contract for the 
first phase of reconstructing the hazardous intersection of Palos Verdes drives 
North and West. 
</P>
<P>
Work by Excel Paving of Long Beach should begin at the end of August and be 
completed in four months. Crews will be on the job from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. 
Monday through Friday, and traffic will be slowed by detours, Assistant City 
Engineer Gary Wynn said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase involves realigning the curve leading north out of the city 
into Torrance on Palos Verdes Boulevard. This curve, the most dangerous part of 
the intersection, has figured in several lawsuits against the city. 
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed there in crashes from 1981 to 1983, and 71 other 
accidents have been reported over the years, including one that left a 
29-year-old man with brain damage and led to a $1.4-million settlement by the 
city's insurers. 
</P>
<P>
When the first phase is completed, a wide median will separate two lanes going 
out of Palos Verdes Estates from a single lane coming into the city. The 
existing curve, which makes a partial S, will be somewhat straightened. 
</P>
<P>
Later phases of the project -- work on the triangle intersection and on Palos 
Verdes Drive West to Via Corta -- are not ready for bids, Wynn said. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's council meeting, several members of the audience said they opposed 
spending so much money when accidents could be prevented by simply enforcing 
the speed limits. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said police do patrol the intersection to curtail speeding but 
cannot be there constantly. They said juries have found speeding and drinking 
to be factors in accidents there but nonetheless have ruled that the city is 
somewhat liable because the curve is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a problem that we can't continue to ignore. It won't go away," said 
Mayor Ruth Gralow. "I think this is something we need for safety reasons."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ORDINANCE BANS HEAVY TRUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Estates City Council has passed an urgency ordinance banning 
through traffic by heavy trucks in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The measure takes effect immediately and will be supplanted in six weeks by a 
permanent ordinance that was also enacted Tuesday. The measures ban trucks 
weighing more than 6,000 pounds unless they are delivering or picking up 
materials in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council said the city's streets are too narrow and too fragile for heavy 
truck traffic. "We don't want to see trucks coming through the city from Rancho 
Palos Verdes projects over narrow streets and over streets that are being 
rehabilitated," Mayor Ruth Gralow said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure reflects concern in cities adjacent to Rancho Palos Verdes about 
heavy truck traffic from several large construction projects there. Officials 
said the projects could generate thousands of trips by trucks which haul fill 
on Palos Verdes Drives West and North to the Chandler Quarry in Rolling Hills 
Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates Police Chief Gary Johansen said signs announcing the ban 
will be posted within 10 days at all entrances to the city. Officers will issue 
warnings for "a few weeks" before issuing citations. 
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Rolling Hills Estates has a similar restriction on truck traffic, 
which does not apply to Chandler trucks because the quarry is in that city. The 
council has discussed restricting truck traffic further. At its Aug. 8 meeting, 
it will receive an environmental impact report and a study from its traffic 
engineer on the effects of stiffening the ordinance.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER BACK-FLOW PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council has voted unanimously to adopt a program to regulate 
and inspect back-flow prevention devices that keep private water lines from 
contaminating the public water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly, the Los Angeles County Health Department held primary responsibility 
for such inspections but because of changes in the state Health and Safety 
Code, county health officials notified cities last year the department would 
relinquish that role. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Torrance Municipal Water Department employees annually will 
inspect businesses that use chemicals that could be drawn into city water 
mains. They will ensure the firms have properly installed back-flow prevention 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 175 such devices in use in Torrance. City water officials said 
they expect that number to increase substantially as commercial and industrial 
growth continues. 
</P>
<P>
Charles J. Schaich, a senior administrative analyst for the Water Department, 
said the city has promoted one employee and added one new inspector under the 
program.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: N. HOLLYWOOD MAN SURRENDERS AFTER STANDOFF WITH 
POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reportedly suicidal man who fired gunshots at police and a police helicopter 
was arrested Wednesday after a two-hour standoff at his North Hollywood home, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Raymond Molenda, 31, surrendered at 1:15 a.m. by walking out of his home 
in the 5400 block of Morella Avenue, Sgt. Ike Langsam said. Molenda was 
arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a police officer and was taken to 
the Van Nuys Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Molenda holed up in his house with a 9-millimeter automatic handgun about 11 
p.m. Tuesday and refused to come out after his wife went to the North Hollywood 
police station and reported that her husband was armed and suicidal, Langsam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The first officers to approach the house were told by Molenda to go away or he 
would shoot, Langsam said. The officers took cover. When backup officers 
arrived, Molenda fired more than six shots at police on the ground and in a 
police helicopter circling above. No one was hit. Police fired two shots back, 
missing Molenda. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Chate Aszanonda, who fired the shots, was knocked unconscious when he 
tried to jump out of Molenda's line of fire and struck his head on a wall, 
police said. His partner, Don Tsunawaki, a rookie, went into the line of fire 
and carried Aszanonda to safety, police said. The injured officer was treated 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby homes were evacuated and the Police Department's Special Weapons and 
Tactics unit was called. An officer, speaking to Molenda by phone, talked him 
into surrendering, police said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GIVEN 16-YEAR PRISON TERM IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man with a history of mental illness was sentenced Wednesday to 16 years in 
prison for the murder of a Chatsworth man. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Connelly, 21, was sentenced by San Fernando Superior Court Judge Malcolm 
Mackey, who -- after a trial in April -- found Connelly guilty of the Jan. 9 
slaying of Melchor Miranda, 27. Miranda was slain in his apartment in the 20900 
block of Lassen Street after the two had spent the day at Universal Studios, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
A friend found Miranda's body the next day in the bathtub of the apartment, 
police said. He had been beaten with a blunt object and strangled, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly was arrested three days later while driving Miranda's car in 
Hollywood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly, who had been living in California about three months at the time of 
the killing, had a history of mental illness, which was first discovered when 
he was 5, court documents said.

TRANSIT PANEL VOTES TO FIGHT ROBBINS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission has voted to continue fighting 
legislation that would force it to extend the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro 
Rail line underground through the east San Fernando Valley instead of building 
a cheaper light-rail system. 
</P>
<P>
Saying it interferes with local decision making, commissioners voted 8 to 2 
Wednesday to oppose the bill by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we need a commission if each route is going to be legislated 
from Sacramento," said Commissioner Barna Szabo. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on behalf of the commission's Government Relations and Finance 
Committee, commission representatives in Sacramento have already testified 
against the bill, which was reported out of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee last week. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the line would run on the Southern Pacific railroad's 
little-used Burbank branch that crosses the Valley from North Hollywood to 
Warner Center parallel to Chandler and Victory boulevards and Oxnard and Topham 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
To satisfy homeowners, the line would be either underground or in a deep trench 
in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
To cut costs, the line would end in the Sepulveda Basin. Travelers bound for 
the West Valley would transfer to buses.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: BONITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The torching of a store owned by an Iraqi businessman was not racially 
motivated as first believed, Sheriff's Department investigators said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the arson stemmed from a long-running personal dispute between the 
store's manager and the key suspect in the case, Dr. Douglas Wofford, 41, a 
Carlsbad chiropractor, said Sheriff's Sgt. Conrad Grayson of the arson and bomb 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
Swastikas spray-painted on the storefront shortly before the fire led 
investigators to assume a racial motive at first, Grayson said.

1ST DRUG DEALER CONVICTED OF PLAYGROUND LAW VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man who sold drugs to an undercover officer in Canoga Park was 
convicted Wednesday in what prosecutors said was the first case in the nation 
under a new federal law that sets stiffer penalties for dealing drugs near 
playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Gutierrez-Rizo, 19, was found guilty by a jury of selling one-third of a 
gram of cocaine at Lanark Recreation Center on Lanark Street. He was standing 
five to seven feet from the edge of the playground at the park, Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Jimmye Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers set up the operation there in response to numerous citizen 
complaints of narcotics trafficking," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Law 
</P>
<P>
Under a federal law passed in 1987, people convicted of dealing drugs within 
100 feet of playgrounds, schoolyards, video arcades, colleges and public 
swimming pools may receive double the sentence previously imposed, Warren said. 
Consequently, Gutierrez faces a minimum of one year in prison without the 
possibility of parole or probation and a maximum of 40 years in prison, Warren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 2 by U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon. 
</P>
<P>
Before the law went into effect, there was no mandatory minimum sentence for 
selling very small quantities of drugs, such as occurred in this case, Warren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been a number of convictions under the same law for selling drugs 
near schools, Warren said, but this was the first case in the nation involving 
the sale of drugs near a playground. 
</P>
<P>
A co-defendant in the case, Sergio Hurtado-Esquivel, who was with Gutierrez 
during the drug sale, is scheduled to be tried in federal court starting today.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 47-year-old woman pleaded guilty Wednesday to involuntary manslaughter for 
helping her daughter attempt an abortion that led to the death of a newborn 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
Ida Franks entered her plea before San Diego Superior Court Judge Andrew 
Wagner, which included an agreement with the district attorney's office that 
could led to a one-year jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner set sentencing for Aug. 23. Franks remains free on her own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Franks' daughter, Vickie Judkins, 24, of Oceanside, testified April 28 in her 
mother's preliminary hearing that, days before she gave birth to twins, her 
mother used a Lysol-soaked straw to induce an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Judkins said that, many years ago, her mother had done the same thing to 
herself when she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
In Judkins' case, one twin was born dead on Dec. 30, 1987, but the other was 
born alive, though it soon died. The deliveries occurred at Judkins' home, 
though she went to the store to purchase some beer before the second baby was 
delivered. 
</P>
<P>
Judkins said her mother and her husband, Willie Judkins, a Marine stationed at 
Camp Pendleton, took the bodies away and put them in a trash bin off Interstate 
5. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies have never been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Judkins pleaded guilty to child endangerment March 21 and was sentenced 
June 1 to five years' probation and 160 hours of community service in an 
Oceanside soup kitchen.

FOR ONCE, HAWKSTER DOESN'T TAKE FIFTH; 
</P>
<P>
COLT, SYMBOL OF TRIPLE CROWN FUTILITY, WINS AS DEL MAR MEET OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hawkster's futile chase for the 1989 Triple Crown got him nothing but hot, 
dirty and a fan club that admires consistency. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Silver Hawk was beaten a total of 35 1/2 lengths while chasing 
Sunday Silence and Easy Goer through the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont 
Stakes, finishing fifth each time. Hawkster finally came Wednesday, winning the 
second division of the Oceanside Stakes before 24,040 on opening day at Del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was especially exciting for owner Shelly Meredith, a Del Mar 
resident, after the grind of the Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unforgettable experience," Meredith said of the three defeats. "I 
wouldn't trade it for anything. But now it's time to put him on the turf (in 
the Oceanside), which is what we've been waiting to do. His sister is a stakes 
winner in France." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster's Oceanside victory was worth $39,887 and was his first victory since 
the Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita last Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster completed the mile in 1:36 3/5. Exemplary Leader won the first 
division in 1:37 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster, the 8-5 favorite, paid $5.20, while Exemplary Leader returned $11.80 
as the second choice in his half of the feature. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster gave his backers some anxious moments, with the help of track 
announcer Trevor Denman. Approaching the first turn, Hawkster suddenly 
accelerated to the outside, circling the field and trying to rush to the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the saddle has slipped on Hawkster. Yes, it has," Denman informed 
the fans. 
</P>
<P>
"That's exactly what it looked like," trainer Ron McAnally said. "And I thought 
so, too, because the same thing happened to him here last summer in the 
Futurity." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, jockey Pat Valenzuela had temporarily lost his grip on the 
reins and appeared to lose his balance. Valenzuela blamed the slip on 
Hawkster's sweaty neck. 
</P>
<P>
"He was real wet going to the post," Valenzuela said. "That made the reins 
slippery. Going around the turn, the rein slipped through my left hand and he 
took off." 
</P>
<P>
It might have been for the best. Hawkster, obviously fresh and full of run, 
opened daylight down the backstretch and maintained a clear lead into the final 
furlong. 
</P>
<P>
Lode, the second choice, made a late run but was never a real threat. Tokatee 
finished third. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela's Oceanside exploits began in the first division aboard Friendly Ed, 
a 15-1 shot who put away favored Bruho and held a clear lead with a furlong to 
run. 
</P>
<P>
But then the field began to close, and Friendly Ed began to bear out. Double 
Found was squeezed into Exemplary Leader, who was closing fastest of all on the 
far outside. Trebizond slipped through unaccosted on the rail to get second, a 
head behind Exemplary Leader. Double Fond was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to check my horse a little," said Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode Exemplary 
Leader to one of his three opening day victories. "It could have cost me the 
race." 
</P>
<P>
Given Exemplary Leader's bad luck lately, it was surprising that he held on to 
win. In each of his last five races, the son of Vigors has had some kind of 
misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
"He was absolutely stood on his nose at the start of his last race," said 
trainer Brian Mayberry of the July 3 Silver Screen Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, Exemplary Leader was caught in a similar squeeze in the Cinema 
Handicap on the turf, which was his best effort before the Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"Turf might be the key to him," said Mayberry, who trains a 40-horse stable at 
Del Mar. "He's always been an honest colt, though, as long as he gets a fair 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Combined with the 11 off-track sites, the total handle was an opening day 
record $6,638,861. . . . Clement Hirsch's Magical Mile, the unbeaten winner of 
last Saturday's Hollywood Juvenile, came out of the race with a broken knee and 
will miss the rest of the season. . . . Bat Out of Hell, winner of the ninth 
race, gave Michele Dollase her first victory as a trainer, and gave apprentice 
Corey Nakatani his first victory at Del Mar. . . . Olympic Prospect, who came 
off an eight-month layoff to win by 11 1/2 lengths at Louisiana Downs last 
Saturday, might defend his title in the Bing Crosby Handicap at Del Mar Sunday. 
His opposition would include On the Line and Sam Who. . . . Annoconnor and 
Claire Marine face off in the Palomar Handicap on Saturday.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
STRUGGLING ORIOLES SCORE 4 IN FIRST, BUT TWINS FIGHT BACK FOR 5-4 WIN 
</P>

<P>
Manager Frank Robinson keeps denying it, but the signs are there. The Baltimore 
Orioles are feeling the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
They scored four runs against Shane Rawley in the first inning Wednesday night 
at Minneapolis, then ended up losing their seventh consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Baker singled with the bases loaded and one out in the ninth inning to 
give the Minnesota Twins a 5-4 victory. The Orioles' lead in the American 
League East has been cut to 4 1/2 games over the Cleveland Indians and Toronto 
Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Although Robinson kept saying the 14-game journey that began last Thursday in 
Oakland was another trip, his players apparently felt differently. When they 
began the trip, the Orioles needed one victory to equal their win total for 
last season; they are still a victory away. 
</P>
<P>
"You're always worried about the mental things in a losing streak," Robinson 
said, "and that's why they become longer losing streaks. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't panic and we can't lose our heads. We have to come out and battle our 
way out. Little things are beating us. We could have won, but we didn't. We 
can't let it get us down." 
</P>
<P>
Oriole starter Bob Milacki simply couldn't handle Kent Hrbek. The first baseman 
hit two home runs and put the Twins back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh Milacki, hit Randy Bush and Baker tripled to tie the score. Mike 
Smith came in to strike out Kirby Puckett and end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Tim Laudner and Al Newman hit one-out singles off Mark Williamson 
and Bush walked to set the stage for Baker. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reardon, the third Twin pitcher, closed it out and picked up his first 
victory since June 26. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 9, New York 7 -- The Indians moved into a tie for second at Cleveland 
when Pete O'Brien hit an opposite-field double to drive in two runs in the 
eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pure shank," O'Brien said. "With a man on third you want to 
concentrate on the big area of the field. You don't want to pull one that can 
be turned into a double play." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Jones, who gave up a two-run home run to Luis Polonia in the top of the 
eighth that gave the Yankees a 7-6 lead, wound up the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Terrell, recently obtained from the San Diego Padres lasted 4 2/3 innings, 
giving up six runs and 11 hits. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the Yankees' eighth in their last nine games. They are 47-53 and 
are tied with Milwaukee for fifth place, seven games out of first. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Seattle 3 -- Shortstop Ozzie Guillen continues to lead the White Sox 
to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Guillen hit two run-scoring singles and stretched his hitting streak to 16 
games as the White Sox won for the 11th time in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
In a game delayed twice for a total of more than two hours because of rain, the 
White Sox won their 10th in a row at home. 
</P>
<P>
Guillen is batting .424 (25 for 59) during his streak. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Bobby Thigpen got the last five outs for his 21st save. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Baines had three hits for the White Sox, including his 13th home run of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 7, Boston 4 -- Right-hander Bret Saberhagen has become the Royals' 
stopper on the road, winning for the seventh time in his last eight decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was in constant trouble, giving up nine hits and walking five in 6 
2/3 innings, Saberhagen (10-5) had the support of a 12-hit attack. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Wilson led the way with four hits, scored a run and drove in two. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 11, Toronto 1 -- Julio Franco had two hits and drove in three runs at 
Arlington, Tex., to lead the Rangers and take over the league RBIlead. Franco 
has 74 RBIs, two more than teammate Ruben Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-hit attack enabled rookie Kevin Brown to improve to 9-6. Brown gave up 
seven hits in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 3, Detroit 2 -- Robin Yount hit a two-run home run in the first 
inning at Milwaukee to extend his hitting streak to 16 games. Then, in the 
eighth he walked with the bases loaded to give the Brewers the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Teddy Higuera (5-4), slowly rounding into form, held the Tigers to three hits 
in eight innings. DAN HAFNER

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
MURPHY RETURNS TO POWER IN BRAVES' WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was just a few years ago that Dale Murphy was generally recognized as the 
best player in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
He was winning most of the awards, hitting the most home runs and driving in 
runs in bunches. 
</P>
<P>
When he hit his first slump in 1986, when he tailed off in most offensive 
categories, it wasconsidered a fluke. But Murphy and nobody else could explain 
what happened last year when he suffered a power outage. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves tried to trade him this spring, but nobody wanted to take a chance 
on the 33-year-old outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
He has continued to struggle this season. He went long spells without an 
extra-base hit. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, though, there have been a few occasions when the power is back. 
</P>
<P>
It happened Wednesday night at Atlanta when Murphy hit a three-run home run and 
drove in the winning run with a long sacrifice fly as the Braves beat the San 
Francisco Giants, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
The home run, Murphy's ninth, sailed well over the fence in left and wiped out 
a three-run deficit. Before he hit the home run, Murphy was only two for 30 
lifetime against Scott Garrelts of the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to get more of a line-drive swing the last week or so," said 
Murphy, who is hitting .240. "If I hit a home run, that's fine, but I really 
haven't been hitting any so rather than try for them I figured I'd try to hit 
line drives and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
With the Houston Astros beating the Dodgers, the Giants' lead in the National 
League West dropped to two games. Even after Murphy's home run, the Giants went 
into the eighth with a 4-3 lead and sent bullpen ace Steve Bedrosian to the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian started by walking Jody Davis. A passed ball and a bunt single put 
runners on first and third. Jeff Treadway singled in the tying run, and Murphy 
hit the long fly to send in the decisive run. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 3, New York 2 -- While the Mets may be trying to make a deal for 
pitcher Frank Viola of the Minnesota Twins, they are trying to stay within 
striking distance of first place. 
</P>
<P>
But the fifth-place Pirates aren't making it easy. Pittsburgh starter John 
Smiley gave up only three hits and drove in a run at New York to improve his 
lifetime record against the Mets to 6-1. Two of the hits were home runs by 
Kevin Elster and Mark Carreon. Carreon's was his third pinch home run of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Met fans took out their anger on catcher Gary Carter, booing him in his 
first appearance in the starting lineup since he went on the disabled list May 
12. Carter was 0 for 3. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, Cincinnati 3 -- The Reds' longest losing streak since 1966 reached 
10 when an infield hit by Luis Salazar in the eighth inning at Cincinnati broke 
a 3-3 tie. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, the Reds lost 11 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, bothered by injuries and playing without their entire starting 
outfield, aren't getting the bounces, either. Just before Salazar broke the 
tie, Mike Pagliarulo hit a bloop single to put runners on first and third. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rasmussen allowed three hits over 6 1/3 innings before yielding to Mark 
Grant (4-1), who got the victory, pitching 1 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds had tied the score, 3-3, in the seventh by loading the bases against 
Rasmussen on Scotti Madison's double, a fielder's choice and a walk with one 
out. Mariano Duncan grounded to third, but Pagliarulo's throw home failed to 
get Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, Montreal 3 -- The Expos were in an ideal position to improve 
their lead in the East to 4 1/2 games at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
They had a 3-2 lead behind Zane Smith, who had pitched well in relief, and 
needed to get only three more outs. 
</P>
<P>
It was the beginning of the end to the six-game winning streak when third 
baseman Tim Wallach fumbled Bob Dernier's grounder. Von Hayes doubled to put 
runners on second and third and bring bullpen ace Tim Burke to the rescue. 
Burke had been successful on 21 of his 27 opportunities for a save. 
</P>
<P>
Not this time. He retired two batters, but with a two-strike count and two out, 
Randy Ready lashed a two-run single and the Phillies ended their six-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 2, Chicago 0 -- Vince Coleman, out several days because of a sore 
leg, came back withall his speed in this game at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman drove in both Cardinal runs and stole three bases to keep the Cubs from 
closing in on Montreal. He has 50 steals and has not been thrown out all year. 
</P>
<P>
Jose DeLeon limited the Cubs to two hits in eight innings, then Ken Dayley and 
Todd Worrell closed out the Cubs in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Sutcliffe (10-9) did manage to end Jose Oquendo's hitting streak at 23 
games. DAN HAFNER

losing at the French Open in May. 
</P>

PRO SPIKER GOT AN UNUSUAL VIEW OF EX-PARTNER'S ACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE HALL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Chisholm-Carrillo had a better view last year when she could watch the 
jump serves of teammate Jackie Silva play havoc with the unfortunates on the 
other side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
But partnerships in women's pro beach volleyball can be fleeting. And so can 
success. 
</P>
<P>
All Chisholm-Carrillo could do was joke about it Sunday after Silva and her 
current partner, Patty Dodd, buried Chisholm-Carrillo and Janice Opalinski, 
15-3, to win the Hermosa Beach Open. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie must be getting $100 for every ace," the 6-foot-2 former Olympian said 
of her former partner. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the $1,890 apiece Dodd and Silva won for their eighth victory in 
nine tournaments this season, Chisholm-Carrillo's appraisal fell a few dollars 
short. 
</P>
<P>
"Today her serve was on," said Dodd of her teammate's five-ace performance. 
"The best defense is a great serve. It gets (he other team) out of place and 
out of their game." 
</P>
<P>
Silva, the Brazilian heralded as the best player on the women's tour, also had 
several key spikes, played tenacious defense and consistently gave Dodd 
flawless sets. Combined with Dodd's strong hitting and defense, the pair were 
unstoppable throughout the two-day event north of Hermosa Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
So much so that Dodd, asked to name the most difficult match they played in the 
tournament, could think of nothing more taxing than a 15-7 rout of Judy Bellamo 
and Lisa Strand early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
They certainly had no problem with Chisholm-Carrillo and Opalinski. In the 
winners bracket final, Dodd and Silva won 15-5 to gain a spot in the finals. 
Then as Chisholm-Carrillo and Opalinski toiled against Nina Matthies and Elaine 
Roque in the consolation game -- they won 15-9 to gain a rematch for the 
tournament championship -- Dodd and Silva sipped margaritas. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the tequila," Dodd clarified. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was devastation for the third-seeded team of Chisholm-Carrillo 
and Opalinski. Dodd and Silva streaked ahead 5-0, getting the last two points 
on Silva jump-serve aces. 
</P>
<P>
Chisholm-Carrillo spiked one home shortly thereafter for the only point the 
losers would score that did not come on a Silva-Dodd error. A bad pass by Dodd 
narrowed the score to 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
But soon the lead was back to five. Dodd made a lunging save, Silva an 
off-balance set and Dodd a scoring spike to make it 7-2. Then a Silva jump 
serve hit the back line for another ace and an 8-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was 8-2," Dodd said, "we pretty much had the momentum." 
</P>
<P>
The score moved to 8-3, but a three-point run with Dodd serving put the game 
out of reach. A Dodd spike made it 9-3, a Silva save and spike made it 10-3, 
then Silva added a scoring block on a hit by the much-taller Chisholm-Carrillo 
and it was 11-3. 
</P>
<P>
The game ended on a thrilling rally during which Silva, Opalinski and Dodd made 
diving digs. It was culminated when Silva made a perfect set while sprawled in 
the sand and Dodd drilled home the winning spike. 
</P>
<P>
"They just had a great rhythm," Opalinski said. "The way to beat them is to 
take them out of their rhythm. Then they start making mistakes and getting 
frustrated and the tension builds. 
</P>
<P>
"But when Jackie's serve is on, there's nothing you can do." 
</P>
<P>
Silva has been credited with bringing the jump serve to the women's game. Used 
extensively indoors and by a growing number of players on the men's beach 
circuit, the serve comes over the net with the speed and trajectory of a spike, 
immediately putting the opposition on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Chisholm-Carrillo and Opalinski also use the technique, but the quickness and 
passing ability of Dodd and Silva kept it from being a factor Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
So the questions came up again: Do they have a weakness? Can they be beaten? 
</P>
<P>
"There's a way to beat them," Opalinski said. "We don't just go out there and 
hope they make mistakes. You can serve tough. Mix up the blocking and the 
coverage behind. Take them out of their game. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot we can do. We made the finals of this tournament. We'll try 
again next time." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dodd and Silva know they're marked women. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure is on us," Dodd said. "They're all out to beat us. But we're 
taking each game one at a time, from the first round to the finals."

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL;

<P>
DIVINE INSPIRATION ATTRACTED KYMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Coley Kyman is 6-foot-5, 200 pounds, handsome, gregarious and one of the top 
young volleyball players in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
He also is painfully honest. Even when spilling the truth gets a bit painful. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is," he said, pausing to prepare his words, "what drew me into 
volleyball was girls." 
</P>
<P>
Following basketball practice on a recreation team he was playing with four 
years ago, he caught his first glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all playing volleyball -- I mean really cute girls -- so I talked to 
the coach and they needed another guy so I figured I'd try it," Kyman said, 
grinning sheepishly at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like fun and the basketball coach said he didn't care. He said it 
might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to play." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as it turned out, the first of a lifetime of chances. 
</P>
<P>
Kyman has since advanced from the rec leagues to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, he was selected most valuable player at the junior nationals in 
Toledo, Ohio. This week, he is a starting middle blocker for the North team at 
the U. S. Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
His has been a whirlwind climb up the competition ladder, starting with that 
co-ed game in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun, but I never expected anything out of it," Kyman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gifted with size and quickness, Kyman was a volleyball natural. His coach 
recommended that he take up the sport more seriously when he enrolled at Reseda 
High that fall. 
</P>
<P>
Kyman said he might, only to find out that Reseda didn't have a team. But it 
was only a temporary setback. 
</P>
<P>
The following year Reseda added volleyball and Kyman earned back-to-back City 
Section 3-A Division Player of the Year awards by the time he graduated in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
All of which led to a major decision during April's NCAA signing period. Would 
it be football or volleyball? 
</P>
<P>
Football always had been Kyman's favorite sport. He had pictured himself at 
quarterback, leading a major college team to championships much as he had at 
Reseda, which won the City 2-A title his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
There were offers, too -- from Nevada Las Vegas and Miami of Ohio. "Playing 
college football was something I'd wanted to do my whole life," Kyman said. 
"But I decided to go with volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
The college he chose was Cal State Northridge, which is a five-minute drive 
from his home. Northridge also is regularly located somewhere near the bottom 
of the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. standings. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, there were other schools interested, but Kyman struggled in the classroom. 
And many questioned his ability. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just been in the last year or so that he's really become a high-caliber 
player," said Rod Wilde, the North coach and an assistant at Pepperdine. "He's 
just starting to work at it full-time and he's come a long way fast." 
</P>
<P>
Kyman is hopeful he can take Northridge on an ascent with him. 
</P>
<P>
"At the junior nationals a lot of people were telling me that coaches were 
saying that they had no idea I was so good," Kyman said. "People were saying, 
'We should have got that guy.' 
</P>
<P>
"But Northridge really wanted me and I can hardly wait to play for them. 
Hopefully, if I work hard, I can help Northridge become a better program and 
we'll start beating some of those teams from over the hill." 
</P>
<P>
Kyman is familiar with the challenges that teams like UCLA, USC and Pepperdine 
pose. He was a linesman at Northridge home games during the past season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to go in there and learn as much as I can and be a leader as much as 
I can," Kyman said. "I've always been on winning teams and I'm sure I will be 
at Northridge, too." 
</P>
<P>
Wilde, whose Pepperdine team ranks annually among the nation's best, expects 
that Kyman will make an impact for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he can be a very good player at the college level," he said. "I'm sure 
Northridge will probably put a lot of responsibility on his shoulders and I'm 
sure Coley will be up to it." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly he will be coming off a summer of rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Kyman followed his dominating play in the junior nationals with a spirited 
performance in his Olympic Festival debut Tuesday. He had 18 kills, seven digs, 
six blocks and a team-high .531 hitting percentage with only one error in 32 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
"We call him 'Machine Gun' because he has such quick arms," Wilde said. 
</P>
<P>
If Kyman has a flaw in his game, Wilde said, it's his jumping ability, which is 
only average. 
</P>
<P>
"But he'll get stronger and he'll be a better jumper, too, now that he's 
working at volleyball full-time," Wilde predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how long he will continue focusing solely on volleyball is something he 
hasn't decided, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to play football again someday," said Kyman, who discussed the 
possibility with Northridge football Coach Bob Burt. "But for this year, 
anyway, I'll be concentrating just on volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, a few cute girls are seen out by the football field.

SAUGUS RACER SEES RED OVER YELLOW-FLAG DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN FLEISCHMAN, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Race driver Will Harper of Tarzana can be forgiven if he seems haunted by 
yellow flags. The one he saw Saturday night at Saugus Speedway cost him at 
least $850 and first place in the season points standings. 
</P>
<P>
Harper was leading the Winston 100 Sportsman Division race at the speedway 
until the 93rd lap when he spun into the middle of the infield after a 
collision with Craig Rayburn. Harper quickly recovered and re-entered the race 
in second place behind eventual winner Dave Phipps. 
</P>
<P>
Track officials, however, waved a yellow flag that signals caution and forbids 
passing. Because the accident occurred in the last 10 laps of the race, Harper 
was sent to the back of the pack. He finished 11th. 
</P>
<P>
If Harper had placed second he would have collected a $1,000 purse. Instead he 
picked up $150 for finishing the race, plus $460 for leading for 92 laps ($5 a 
lap). 
</P>
<P>
Because the Winston 100 is a double-points race, Harper was hurt in the points 
standings. He entered the race in first place, 13 points ahead of Gary Sigman. 
He's now fourth, 12 points behind Keith Spangler, who leads with 248 points. 
</P>
<P>
Harper claims that after the race both fans and drivers told him he was 
short-changed by track officials. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a hundred people in my pit telling me I got robbed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, who does not blame Rayburn for the accident, claims the yellow flag was 
not called until after he was out of danger and back on the track. He also 
claims that track officials should have placed him back at the front of the 
pack because the accident was not his fault. Failing that, he should have been 
allowed to stay in second, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until I got back on the track and going that they decided to throw 
the yellow," Harper said. "The time to throw a yellow would be if I was stuck 
on the middle of the track or on the racing surface. But I never was. 
</P>
<P>
"But every other time there was a wreck they waited to see if the guy could get 
going before they threw the yellow. I have it on videotape. The whole race it 
shows guys spinning out, sitting next to the track with cars going by for a 
lap, but no yellow. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the official) probably did what he thought was right at the time. But 
afterward he should have admitted that it was a mistake to call a yellow and 
say 'put him back where he was.' I've seen them do it before. . . . They can do 
that when they feel it's right." 
</P>
<P>
Saugus Racing Director Monte Monteleone defends the track's decision, which he 
characterized as a judgment call. In addition, the move which sent Harper to 
the back of the pack is standard operating procedure, according to Monteleone. 
</P>
<P>
"During a normal program or in a race over 50 laps, during the last 10 laps, 
any car that brings out a yellow must restart at the end," Monteleone said. "He 
would have been able to hold that position before Lap 90. "It's not a matter of 
whose fault it is. What was done was racing procedure. Nobody was sure how it 
happened. When a person is involved in a racing incident you cannot arbitrarily 
put that person back in their position. If you started doing that you would 
spend all night deciding where to put people." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the outcome riles Harper, who has trouble accepting what he sees as an 
injustice. 
</P>
<P>
"I can always get more money, but I can't go back in time and get that race 
back," he said. "You work so hard at something and everybody puts in a winning 
effort and you're winning. Then all of the sudden someone's carelessness takes 
you out of it. It hurts. That's all I can think about."

DIGEST: NEWBURY PARK RIDER LEADS DRESSAGE WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marie Meyers of Newbury Park led a U. S. sweep of the top three places in 
Wednesday's dressage competition, the opening event of the $148,000 Stockholm 
International Horse Show in Sweden. The show is a dress rehearsal for next 
year's World Equestrian Games. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers, riding Dimitrius, received 1.273 points from the five judges and 
finished just ahead of Robert Dover on Walzertak, who had 1.271 points. Carol 
Lavell on Gifted was third with 1.248 points. 
</P>
<P>
Uta Wusthof, riding Ramon, and fellow West German Nicole Holzer on Ricardo, 
were fourth and fifth with 1.222 and 1.218 points. 
</P>
<P>
The show's featured event, Grand Prix jumping, is scheduled at Olympic Stadium 
on Sunday. The Grand Prix Nations Cup is set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Affholter came to terms with the Green Bay Packers, who selected him in 
the fourth round of the NFL draft. The terms of the pact were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Affholter played receiver at USC, where his juggling, sliding catch for a 
touchdown helped defeat UCLA in 1987 and send the Trojans to the Rose Bowl. He 
also punctuated his prep career by kicking a 64-yard field goal -- then the 
longest in high school history -- while attending Oak Park High in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Martin of Camarillo advanced to the third round of match play 
Wednesday in the U. S. Golf Assn. Junior Girls Championship at the Pine Needles

Kristyl Sunderman of El Cajon, Calif., 3-and- 2. 
</P>
<P>
The low 64 players from a field of 150 advanced to match play. The final match 
is set for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Hunt of Studio City, who shot 81-83 -- 164 Tuesday, missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Gore of Valencia, who fired a four-over 76 in the first round Tuesday and 
a 79 in the second round Wednesday, failed to qualify for further play in the 
U. S. Boys' Junior Championship at Singing Hills Golf and Country Club in El 
Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Chang of Westlake Village also failed to qualify, shooting a 79-80 -- 
159. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodley Lakes Golf Course will host a scramble-format tournament next 
Thursday with proceeds going to the Vietnam Veterans Aid Foundation.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SAN DIEGO'S RILEY YOUNGEST OF MEDALISTS AT SINGING 
HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Riley of San Diego was believed to be part of two firsts Wednesday at the 
USGA Junior Boys' golf championships at Singing Hills Golf Course in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, 15, is believed to be the youngest player to win medalist honors in the 
42-year history of the tournament, and his tie with three other golfers at 
one-over 145 after 36 holes of medalist play was also the first time that more 
than two had tied for medalist. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, who was one-shot behind after a 69 in the first round, tied with Chris 
Edgmon of Edmond, Okla., the first-round leader, Jason Worth of Des Moines, 
Iowa, and Brian Gay of Daleville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
The 156-player field was cut to 64 after Wednesday's round, and match play 
begins with two rounds today beginning at 7 a.m. Players will play the third 
round and quarterfinals Friday and the semifinals and final Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Also advancing to match play is Todd Demsey of Rancho Santa Fe at 150. 
</P>
<P>
Leta Lindley of Carlsbad and Kristyl Sunderman of El Cajon advanced to the 
third round of match play at the USGA Junior Girls' championship at the Pine 
Needles Resort in Southern Pines, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Lindley defeated Tracy Dupre of Newport Beach, 3 and 2, in the first round and 
then won, 2-up, over Kristen Krogsrud of Placerville. 
</P>
<P>
Sunderman, who just made the cut of 162 in medalist play, defeated Emilee Klein 
of Studio City, 3 and 2, in the first round. Sunderman, who played at Valhalla 
High School, then went 19 holes to defeat Canadian Marie Josee Desbiens, 1 up, 
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Rudolph III of La Jolla was defeated, 1-up, by Michael Glaesel of Arvada, 
Colo. in the first round of match play at the Broadmoor men's tournament at 
Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph, a sophomore at Oklahoma and two-time San Diego Section high school 
champion at La Jolla High, was the tournament medalist. 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Nomads will play the Portland Timbers Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at 
Aztec Bowl in a Western Soccer League playoff semifinal match. 
</P>
<P>
If the Nomads win, they will play host to the winner of the Los Angeles 
Heat-San Francisco Blackhawks match Aug. 12 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Nomads (12-4) split their two matches with Portland, losing, 4-0, in Oregon 
and winning, 1-0, on penalty kicks in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the WSL championship will meet the American Soccer League 
champion in early September at San Jose State. The WSL and ASL, which has 10 
teams in the eastern United States, are planning to merge within the next six 
months.

DELAHOUSSAYE WINS SOME, LOSES SOME IN MIXED DAY AT DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During Eddie Delahoussaye's 21 years of riding race horses, he has felt all the 
emotions you can in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
But he hardly expected to experience every one during Wednesday's opening of 
Del Mar's 50th season. 
</P>
<P>
His day began with grief when he learned of a serious injury to Magical Mile, 
the unbeaten 2-year-old that Delahoussaye had guided to victory Saturday in the 
Hollywood Juvenile Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Grief turned to shock when Delahoussaye opened his racing day by riding Silent 
Mandate, a 25-1 longshot, to victory in the first race. Silent Mandate paid 
$53.80. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," he said. "I thought we had a chance, but in racing you never 
know.' 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, Delahoussaye sensed he had a pretty good chance to win and did, 
riding B.J. Bucks, trained by Danny Velasquez, to a 2 3/4-length victory. B.J. 
Bucks went off at 6-1 and paid $15.60. 
</P>
<P>
One race later, Delahoussaye began wishing the day would never end after he 
guided Exemplary Leader to a photo-finish victory over Trebizond in the first 
division of the $68,0870 Oceanside Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran good on the turf before," Delahoussaye said. 'He was trying to get out 
a little on the last turn and finally switched leads in the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
After the race, Delahoussaye was presented with a trophy that commemorated his 
4,000th career victory, which he attained last year at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"That was nice and something I didn't expect," said Delahoussaye, a native of 
Louisiana who won his first recognizable race at Evangeline Downs in the 
southern part of that state. 
</P>
<P>
But in a sport to which he has given more than half his 39 years, Delahoussaye 
has become accustomed to expecting the unexpected. Take for instance the unkind 
injury to Magical Mile. The fractured knee Magical Mile suffered in Saturday's 
race will keep him out the remainder of the 2-year-old season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad," Delahoussaye said. "He acted like he had the temperment to go a 
mile or longer. He showed that he's a strong colt." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, another promising colt who had run well under Delahoussaye as a 
2-year-old, Roving Boy, looked strong until he was injured months before the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
'It just happens," Delahoussaye said. "It's one of those things that you have 
to accept." 
</P>
<P>
But injuries to horses have not been the only cause of pain for Delahoussaye 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago at Del Mar, he was buried in a spill and bruised his back 
badly. In 1983 at Del Mar, he was kicked in his hip while in the paddock. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like a shot gun," he said with a wince. "I was hit in the muscle, 
and I was black and blue over my entire body." 
</P>
<P>
Although his body is healed, Delahoussaye felt it necessary to knock on wood 
twice as he spoke about the upcoming Del Mar season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great here," he said. "Santa Anita would be too hard on you with the smog 
and everything. But down here, the weather's nice, it's a great atmosphere, and 
it's a different type crowd." 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot more younger people here. Not to take anything away from the 
old people, but I like being around all the young faces." 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye's good feelings ended in the fifth Wednesday; he was unable to win 
any of his last four starts. He came closest to his fourth victory in the 
second division of the Oceanside Stakes but came up 1 1/2 lengths short of 
Hawkster while riding Lode. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran good," Delahoussaye said of his 3-year-old. "The other horse was 
getting out all the way on the first turn and still just shot by him. I think 
you'll see a better race next time."

ARCHITECTURE: DOES PANEL HAVE TOO NARROW A VIEW OF DOWNTOWN PLANNING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When it comes to community advisory groups, the Centre City Planning Committee 
(CCPC) could outwrestle them all with its political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Appointed in 1987 by the San Diego City Council, the 25-member panel was 
charged with developing a 20-year master plan for downtown that would 
accommodate the desires of a broad range of interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Horton Plaza Shopping Center developer Ernest W. Hahn, the committee is 
stacked deep with the heavy hitters of downtown. So deep, in fact, that some of 
its own members admit the committee may sometimes have a focus too narrow for 
its own good. 
</P>
<P>
"I do sometimes feel like a lone voice or minority," said Susan Carter, a CCPC 
member also active in Citizens Coordinate for Century 3, a group described by 
Carter as "dedicated to improving urban planning through education and citizen 
participation." 
</P>
<P>
But CCPC, she said, "is planning a downtown, which is a central business, 
government and financial core. So it's not surprising or inappropriate to have 
it weighted with those kinds of interests." 
</P>
<P>
"These people are a familiar with how the process works," said Bill Nelson, a 
committee member who serves on the boards of Scripps Bank and the Centre City 
Development Corp. "It was recognized that you have to have people who can 
devote time to the process. You're going to find that people who have something 
at stake or who are in control of their destinies can take time to do this. It 
means lots of meetings and homework. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan that emerges is processed through organizations and people more 
widely representative and responsive: city planners, planning commissioners and 
the city council." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, Carter says, the committee might be doing things differently if it had 
a broader mix including, for example, more ethnic minorities, artists, 
architects and educators. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I've noticed is we get hung up" on minute details, she said. "At 
some point, your mind steps back and says, 'What are we doing here? Have we 
lost sight of what we're doing?' Perhaps this is due to the makeup of the 
committee." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Kaminski, one of two architects on the panel, thinks CCPC meetings, 
which are open to the public, could focus more on the tangibles of a great 
downtown and less on black-and-white data. 
</P>
<P>
"We might be weighted on the analytical side, not the creative. Every time we 
look at something, we have to think, 'If I'm a person on the street, what kind 
of experience do I want to have? Do I want to walk through a residential 
neighborhood of high-rise Meridian-type buildings or 3- and 4-story walk-ups 
that might make a more active street life?' I don't think we do that as often 
as we should." 
</P>
<P>
Not only does the committee's makeup seem skewed toward business concerns, but 
several CCPC members have vested stakes in the financial future of downtown San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are Lee Stein, president of Seaport Village; Scott MacDonald, an 
executive with the Hahn Co., owners and operators of the Horton Plaza Shopping 
Center; Paul Peterson, a prominent land-use attorney known for representing 
large developments before the San Diego City Council; Al Ziegaus, a partner in 
Stoorza Ziegaus &amp; Metzger, a large public relations and marketing firm that 
has represented a variety of major downtown developers; and Lou Wolfsheimer, a 
port commissioner and attorney specializing in land-use matters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Have Vested Interests 
</P>
<P>
And in January the CCPC appointed a six-member subcommittee to speed completion 
of a downtown plan draft made up of powerhouses like Wolfsheimer and Ziegaus, 
but not members like Carter, Glenn Allison from Episcopal Community Services, 
Betty Slater, who owns property in the proposed arts district east of downtown 
and Percy Myers, the committee's lone black, who works in community relations 
at General Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
"I was bothered by it," admitted Carter. "But perhaps it was necessary. It's 
very difficult to do anything with a committee of 25 people. The steering 
committee came up with a report, and it's now going through an exhaustive 
review." 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the subcommittee consists of several individuals who have a major 
stake financially downtown," conceded Bill Sauls, an attorney and downtown 
resident who serves on the CCPC. "But I can also assure you that the 
subcommittee did not make decisions for the CCPC. Plans were thoroughly 
reviewed and well deliberated." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent draft of the plan for downtown was issued last month. Some of 
the important ideas included are: linking the bay to Balboa Park through 
ceremonial streets such as Broadway, preserving historic buildings, encouraging 
alternative modes of transportation and giving developers incentives to include 
such public features as museums and plazas in their projects. 
</P>
<P>
Several disagreements over the plan are being hashed out at CCPC meetings, 
sometimes heatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Detailed recommendations regarding the Navy's property at the foot of Broadway 
are being generated by a CCPC subcommittee chaired by San Diego City Councilman 
Ron Roberts. Roberts wants the Navy to drop one of its proposed high-rises and 
expand a public plaza, and others feel the Navy's plans for multiple office and 
hotel towers are too intense for the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
In the area called Harborview, which includes the stretch of India Street north 
of downtown known for its Italian restaurants and bakeries, some committee 
members want new buildings of up to 90 feet, while others are lobbying for 
smaller-scale neighborhoods with more residential uses. 
</P>
<P>
The whole issue of housing is still very much undecided. In Harborview, Cortez 
Hill and Centre City East, areas designated in the plan for housing, there is 
disagreement about the density and types that should occur. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future of the arts downtown, the plan recommends mandatory public 
art budgets for all new projects and a residential arts district in Centre City 
East. Some artists, though, don't think the committee is adequately addressing 
their needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at the CCPC plan, and even though I still strive to preserve a real 
arts community downtown, I'm just not sure it's not a futile battle," said 
Gloria Poore, an artist and businesswoman who owns and rents out downtown 
spaces to artists. She's spoken to the CCPC twice about what artists need 
downtown, but isn't sure she's been heard. 
</P>
<P>
She said more effort should be made to encourage combination studio/residence 
spaces, keeping costs down by leaving the interiors unfinished. Right now, 
Poore said, the city's Building Inspection Department is too strict about 
requiring formal kitchens and bathrooms and heaters, and this drives up costs 
beyond what artists can afford. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with the way they gather input from the community," said 
architect Richard Bundy, president of the Central City Assn., an alliance of 
downtown businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"They go about it in a fairly token way. Their workshops aren't designed to get 
input, but to reinforce their decisions. I represented the CCA at a couple of 
CCPC meetings, and, when I got done, Hahn said, 'Thank you, we appreciate your 
help,' and I knew nothing would happen with it, it was mist in the wind." 
</P>
<P>
Bundy, who has conducted various architecture and planning workshops in the 
past, will help the CCA conduct workshops on the CCPC plan for a variety of 
downtown groups. 
</P>
<P>
An interim version of the plan is expected to be adopted by the City Council 
this fall, with a final version due next year.

SOCIETY: THE TAMING OF THE WILD, WILD WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Nelson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
RANCHO SANTA FE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The smells of gun smoke, horse flesh and mail-order after shave thickened the 
air Saturday as some of the baddest desperadoes this side of Palm Springs shot 
it out on the ornamental lawns at Ramona Sahm's Texas-sized spread in the 
rolling badlands west of Lake Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
The Hole in the Wall Gang, an astonishingly authentic-looking Wild West riding 
group from Lakeside, brought their guns into play repeatedly for the exquisite 
delectation of about 500 supporters of the Voices for Children Auxiliary, the 
child advocacy group that staged its second annual "Foot Stompin' Madness" 
fund-raiser as a chic re-creation of the Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
The Old West probably was never populated by quite so high a proportion of 
dudes, most of whom rode their Jaguars and BMWs into Sahm's version of Dodge 
City with air conditioners blazing and trigger fingers itching to draw tortilla 
chips through the chili con queso dip. Their Western pedigrees were in some 
cases suspect -- the guest list included a Black Bart from Buffalo, a dance 
hall girl from The Bronx and a Danish desperado from 
</P>
<P>
one of the more fashionable neighborhoods in Copenhagen -- but they came with 
open hearts and ready to stomp their feet madly in a chorus of support for 
Voices for Children. 
</P>
<P>
The men arrived mostly in the shrink-to-fit persona that comes as naturally to 
transplants as to native Californians, but most of the women affected the 
rhinestone cowgirl look that came in with the Reagan years and has yet to be 
relegated to the attic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gambling Hall Holdup 
</P>
<P>
Party chairwoman Margie Ward orchestrated the event as a kind of Saturday Night 
Live at the OK Corral, and even scheduled the Hole in the Wall Gang to rob the 
gambling hall, which seemed redundant in light of the string-tied dealers' 
skills (all proceeds were added to the net take, which contributed more than 
$50,000 to the children auxiliary's coffers). 
</P>
<P>
Ward's co-chair, Claudia Munak, who founded "Foot Stompin' Madness" last year 
with a wildly successful hoe-down in Guatay, said the party unquestionably has 
earned a place on the annual fund-raiser calendar. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a neat party to put together," said Betty Mabee, founder and president 
of the child support auxiliary. "The children who are dependents of the 
Juvenile Court system -- the abused, abandoned and neglected -- will be better 
off after "Foot Stompin' Madness," because we'll be able to recruit and train 
more volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
The auxiliary specifically trains and supervises volunteers to assist children 
who become wards of the court, staying with them until they are placed in 
foster or adoptive homes. Mabee said the program is costly to maintain, and San 
Diego's program has attracted national attention because it is the only one in 
the United States to receive the support of a volunteer auxiliary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Gala 
</P>
<P>
The setting did look off to dusty hills, but it nonetheless was amusing to see 
the place populated solely by the booted and be-jeaned, since the ultra-modern 
Sahm mansion also was the site of the first three "A Night in Monte Carlo" 
balls given for the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, and as many as 200 
guests in black tie have been seated around its indoor swimming pool for gala 
Christmas-season dinners given for the San Diego Symphony. Yet hostess Sahm, 
who often summers in Wyoming, set the right mood, and the guests joined in, 
bucking and rearing when the Savery Brothers Country Western Band offered up 
the Texas Two Step, whinnying along with Brandy King and the Southern Country 
Band and generally horsing around during the auction of a Renaissance portrait 
and a pair of tickets to Super Bowl XXV. 
</P>
<P>
Some far-flung travelers returned to town in time for the party, including 
Jeanne Lawrence, back from taking a three-month course at Sotheby's auction 
house in London, and Barbara ZoBell, back from her annual month's hiatus on the 
Cote d'Azur. The guest list also included Georgia and Al Blatz, Sue Teasdel 
with Brick Allison, Audrey and Don Kaufman, Jeanette and Bobby Foushee, Julie 
and Jay Sarno, Susan Farrell, Bea and Bob Epsten, John Mabee, Karen and Don 
Cohn, Betty and Al deBakcsy, Junko and Larry Cushman, Virginia and Glenn 
Napierski, Barbara and Joe Harper, Kay and Bill Rippee, Lynn Schenck and Hugh 
Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO -- Tiny lights sparkled in the branches of the antique trees at 
Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcala Friday, twinkling in competition with the 
constellations overhead and casting a platinum patina over the tables for 400 
set out for the annual summer gala given at the historic church. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-piece mariachi band blazed away during the cocktail reception, setting 
the Mexican theme that always prevails at Mission parties. 
</P>
<P>
"All we wanted was a colorful party -- color is our theme," said gala chair 
Elsie Weston, who saw to it that fat clay pots crammed with summer flowers 
bloomed on the tables. 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. I. Brent Eagen, the long-time pastor of the church, said the evening 
celebrated a pair of anniversaries, the 220th of the mission (which was founded 
on July 16, 1769, or nearly seven years in advance of the Declaration of 
Independence) and the 40th of the University of San Diego. The latter occasion 
was marked by recognition given USD President Author Hughes and his wife, 
Marge, who were named the evening's guests of honor. 
</P>
<P>
Eagen added that the proceeds, expected to reach about $40,000, would be the 
cornerstone of a planned $200,000 fund to purchase a pipe organ for the 
venerable church. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list was headed by visiting Bishop Robert Brom of Duluth, Minn., who 
will assume episcopal duties in the Diocese of San Diego in July, 1990, and by 
Bishop Leo T. Maher, who will retire at that time. Others were Sally and Bob 
Kazmarek, Linda and Frank Alessio, Phyllis and Anthony Terzich, Lillian and 
Bill Vogt, Mim and Al Sally, Lynn and James Kinder, Lee and P.J. Maturo, Sue 
and Bill Regan, Pat and Ed Keating, Edyth Giaque, Maureen and Allen Blackmore, 
Rita and Joe Neeper, Dolly Ragan, Gretchen and Gus Colachis, Jacqui and George 
Gardner, and Lori and Larry James.

FESTIVAL BALLET BRINGS ASHTON 'ROMEO' TO MET

<P>
There are "Romeos" and there are "Romeos." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to Prokofiev's epochal ballet about Shakespeare's star-cross'd 
lovers, numerous images spring to mind. For some it must be the ageless Galina 
Ulanova floating with innocent passion through an ornate facsimile of Leonid 
Lavrovsky's original Bolshoi production -- an achievement happily preserved on 
film. 
</P>
<P>
Others recall the romantic turbulence of John Cranko's version, as enacted 
first by the Stuttgart Ballet and later by the Joffrey. Or the richly detailed 
cinematic melodrama that Kenneth MacMillan concocted for the Royal Ballet and 
subsequently revised for American Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The first "Romeo and Juliet" to be ventured by a Western company, however, was 
Frederick Ashton's setting for the Royal Danish Ballet in 1955. Much admired 
and yet quickly forgotten -- don't ask why -- it remained a staple of the 
Copenhagen repertory for only a decade. Los Angeles saw it at Shrine Auditorium 
in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Many authorities -- including Ashton himself -- feared this "Romeo" was lost. 
Memories blurred with time, records proved faulty, notation dubious. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, however, Peter Schaufuss rallied the reluctant choreographer, then 81, 
and some eager survivors of the original cast (most notably Niels Bjorn Larsen) 
for a historic exhumation on behalf of the London Festival Ballet. New York got 
to see the result Tuesday when the Festival Ballet -- soon to be renamed the 
English National Ballet -- returned after a 10-year absence to open a two-week 
engagement at the Metropolitan Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
The result was, in many ways, a revelation. Ashton always was a man of taste, 
restraint and precision. Luckily, he also was something of a poet. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his illustrious successors, he felt no need to treat "Romeo" as a 
sprawling epic. He saw no need for verismo indulgences, for lusty harlot trios, 
vegetable fights, prancing clowns or vast courtly maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
He preferred to focus on the plight of the central characters, stressing 
lyricism over drama, intimacy over spectacle, abstraction over literalism. Most 
important, he preferred to stress dance over surface theatricality. 
</P>
<P>
He compressed the action boldly, and apparently had no qualms about cutting 
bits and pieces from the magnificent score. Compared to Cranko and MacMillan, 
Ashton may seem a bit cool, cautious and polite. That, however, makes his 
interpretation no less poignant. On the contrary. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This "Romeo" savors the virtue of intimacy, even in a 4,000-seat house, and 
cherishes the order of classicism. The London production, with its stylized 
designs by Peter Rice, honors the lofty Copenhagen model. 
</P>
<P>
In the cool, hard light of 1989, the episodic structure may seem a bit dated. 
Still, one can find timeless eloquence in the fluidity of the love duets, the 
intricacy of the duels, the athleticism of the playful trios alloted the young 
Montagues and the simplicity of the three tragic encounters in the Capulets' 
tomb. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Festival Ballet does not command the luxurious resources of its 
more famous British counterpart, it serves Ashton with reverence, authority and 
obvious conviction. At 40, Schaufuss is a manly rather than boyish Romeo, but 
his noble ardor remains undiminished. Susan Hogard, his exquisite 21-year-old 
Juliet, embodies vulnerable purity. 
</P>
<P>
The nicely poised, not very British supporting cast is dominated by Maximiliano 
Guerra as a splendidly dapper Mercutio and Nicholas Johnson as an appropriately 
sardonic Tybalt. Matz Skoog (Benvolio) and Patrick Armand (Paris) look like 
incipient Romeos. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Seymour, MacMillan's most feverish Juliet, has come out of 
quasi-retirement to vitalize the reasonable agonies of Lady Capulet. She is 
paired with an elegant Lord who happens to be an old chum from the Royal 
Ballet, Alexander Grant. Freya Dominic bumbles sweetly as the Nurse 
</P>
<P>
The only weak link in the performance Tuesday involved the wayward playing of 
an obviously under-rehearsed pit band. Under the circumstances, one didn't want 
to blame -- or assess -- the conductor, Graham Bond. 
</P>
<P>
The audience at the Royal Gala Performance included Princess Margaret, who is 
about to yield her position as official patron of the struggling, peripatetic 
company to the Princess of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that, according to press materials distributed at the 
performance, the latter has "spoken of her desire to write and choreograph her 
own ballet." It is a bracing prospect.

Don't touch that dial . . . yet! The latest in the continuing saga of classical 
music programming on Los Angeles radio finds KKGO-FM retreating from its 
decision to devote daytime hours to classical music. General Manager Saul 
Levine said Wednesday he will wait to see if KFAC-FM does indeed dump its 
classical programming as expected before he devotes FM air time to Bach and 
Beethoven instead of Brubeck and Basie. "I feel in fairness to Los Angeles the 
posture must be to give KFAC a chance to evaluate their position," Levine said. 
"If they keep a classical format, we will not go classical on FM. What we're 
saying is we hope KFAC stays classical." Last week, Levine announced plans to 
play classical music on KKGO-FM from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. starting in January and 
keep jazz on after-hours. KKGO-AM, which is scheduled to be operational in 
January, would play all jazz. Now, however, Levine says that if KFAC-FM does 
remain classical, he will play mostly classical music on his AM station but 
none on KKGO-FM which now is all-jazz. Should KFAC change formats, he said, 
both of his AM and FM outlets will feature a combination of classical and jazz, 
with jazz still dominating the FM station. Levine noted that KKGO begun as a 
classical station in 1959 but quickly changed to all-jazz in 1960 after losing 
in the ratings to KFAC. Stay tuned . . . ALEENE MacMINN

Drum De-Dum-Dum: Former Beatle Ringo Starr has succeeded in blocking the 
release of an album he feels is of inferior quality. A Superior Court judge in 
Atlanta put the album, which was due out this week, on hold for 30 days while 
Starr's lawyers and a Memphis producer try to settle the issue. Starr doesn't 
like his drum performances and wants to redub them before the album comes out. 
His lawyers accuse producer Chips Moman of trying to release the album on an 
"unheard-of label" to take advantage of Starr's concert tour, which began 
earlier this month and is his first U.S. tour in more than a decade. Moman 
acknowledged that the label is new and operates out of his lawyer's offices, 
but said he wants to get the album out before Starr puts out a live recording 
from the new tour.ALEENE MacMINN

Oscar is coming back downtown to the Music Center for next year's Academy 
Awards, after two years down the freeway at the Shrine Auditorium. Richard 
Kahn, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, says that 
"the Shrine Auditorium allowed the academy to do some new and special things 
with the 60th and 61st Academy Awards telecasts. At the same time, we've always 
had a good relationship with the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and we've done 19 
very handsome shows from that venue. The board's feeling at the moment is that 
we now have two very nice homes for the show, each with its own special 
virtues." Oscar night will be March 26.ALEENE MacMINN

JARVI LEADS TWO ORCHESTRAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A serious conductor with a clear sense of mission, Neeme Jarvi returned to the 
podium of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and led a bracing performance of an 
old-fashioned Hollywood Bowl program: Sibelius' "Finlandia" for an overture, 
the same composer's Second Symphony as finale, the two separated by 
Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
If this was a bag of chestnuts, there were some satisfactions in the roasting, 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Jarvi, who closed the Philharmonic's most recent winter season with Sibelius' 
Second -- in a respectable but unvisceral reading -- this time around coaxed 
from the orchestra considerably more heat, genuine structural cohesion and a 
higher energy level. That level may or may not have been connected to the fact 
that the Philharmonic was augmented to almost double its size by the 
participation of the 90-plus musicians of the summertime Philharmonic Institute 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The old standard seemed restored to its former glories in this well-driven, 
fully resonant -- but never strident -- and virtually immaculate performance. 
Much of the credit must go to the Philharmonic and Institute players, 
naturally, but Jarvi apparently didn't give them much choice. He made the 
familiar work glow with urgency. 
</P>
<P>
He and the combined orchestras achieved a lower plane of inspiration in 
"Finlandia," a work that seems to thwart all attempts to shape its contrasting 
parts into an integrated whole. All hands worked hard on this attempt; the 
results were only momentarily thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
That was unfortunate because, in a moving speech before "Finlandia," Jarvi had 
dedicated the performance to the memory of Martti Talvela, the Finnish singer 
who died over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The thrills in Rachmaninoff's overfamiliar C-minor Concerto were also not 
numerous. Accompanied attentively by Jarvi and the Philharmonic alone, pianist 
Barry Douglas showed none of the colorful temperament that had characterized 
his playing of Tchaikovsky's most popular concerto last summer in this same 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he labored, apparently, trying to bring new wrinkles to its well-known 
profile and got in his own way doing so. 
</P>
<P>
All the notes appeared to be in all the right places but, in the place of song 
and fluency, Douglas substituted declamation and superfluous detailing. Where 
one would have wished for a stroll over a familiar landscape, one got a halting 
and bumpy ride. The result of too much thinking became too little music.

BLUESMAN CHARLES BROWN RECALLS THE GLORY YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a mystery how a performer like Charles Brown can slip so far between the 
cracks that he doesn't appear in Hollywood for more than 40 years. Yet, there 
he was Tuesday night at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill -- a vigorous, 66-year-old 
blues singer/pianist whose skills are still comparable with the best work of 
Otis Redding, Sam Cooke and Bobby (Blue) Bland. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who scored a string of R&amp;B hits with Johnny Moore's Three Blazers in 
the post-World War II era, seemed to bear little resentment over his slide into 
obscurity in the early '50s. His set was peppered with colorful, upbeat tales 
of his glory years in the turbulent, postwar L.A. scene. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, he played the blues in every size and shape, but mostly in the 
sleek, sensual night-music style that had a powerful effect on such performers 
as Ray Charles, Little Richard, Cooke and Redding. Brown sang the likes of the 
Blazers' classic "Drifting Blues," "I Cried Last Night" and "Every Day I Have 
the Blues" with simmering intensity, the heat turned up via energetic solos 
from guitarist Danny Caron and tenor saxophonist Clifford Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's ballad work was no less convincing. "I'm Looking for Someone to Love," 
framed in a rhapsodic, Gershwinesque setting, and the standard "Cottage for 
Sale" were richly enhanced by an almost symbiotic interaction between Brown's 
voice and his piano. DON HECKMAN

IMMUNITY PLAN FOR TAX EVADERS SAID TO BE USUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial procedure under which tax cheats could pay back taxes and avoid 
criminal prosecution is a long-established part of Internal Revenue Service 
practice nationwide and is well known among attorneys specializing in tax 
disputes, legal experts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The informal practice is described in official IRS manuals -- and thus is 
sanctioned by the agency -- and made available to anyone, not just those with 
close relationships with IRS officials, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
These views contrast sharply with characterizations made by congressional 
investigators this week probing allegations of misconduct at IRS offices in Los 
Angeles and elsewhere. Investigators contended that these arrangements, 
involving the Los Angeles office in particular, involved favoritism and were 
not approved by national IRS headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's legal, there's no question about it," said Roger Olsen, a Los Angeles tax 
attorney and former assistant U.S. attorney general in charge of all federal 
tax prosecutions between 1981 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go to tax seminars, the subject is widely disseminated. It's not a 
secret," said Eugene D. Silverman, a Los Angeles tax attorney and a former 
attorney with the IRS and Justice Department. "I strongly feel it should be 
encouraged," he added, noting that the IRS has received millions of dollars in 
tax revenues that it may not otherwise have recovered. 
</P>
<P>
IRS officials said Wednesday that the practice allows delinquent taxpayers to 
avoid prosecution for failing to file tax returns or other tax violations. It 
does not preclude criminal prosecution if taxpayers obtained income illegally 
or committed other non-tax violations. And the practice does not exempt 
taxpayers from interest and penalties owed, or from civil fraud penalties, and 
therefore is not an amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is a need to enforce the law, but also to be able to offer 
people who want to get back into the tax system . . . an opportunity to get 
back," said IRS spokeswoman Ellen Murphy. She added that the agency does not 
know how much in taxes and penalties has been taken in, because the program is 
informal. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional investigators described Tuesday how Sherman Oaks attorney Richard 
J. Trattner used the practice with the IRS' Los Angeles office. He would offer 
a check for a down payment of a client's taxes and the key to a safe deposit 
box containing the client's unfiled tax returns. If the IRS indicated that it 
was unlikely that the client would be investigated, on the basis of a 
description of the case, Trattner would disclose the client's name and the 
box's location. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement for Trattner, a former special agent in the IRS criminal 
investigation division and assistant U.S. attorney, was never officially 
approved by anyone at the IRS Washington office, one investigator said. That 
implied that it was offered as a special favor to him because of his close ties 
to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts interviewed Wednesday said that Trattner's safe deposit box 
method is novel. But they said that grants of immunity to tax evaders are part 
of an informal "voluntary disclosure" policy maintained at the IRS for years. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS in about 1945 established a formal policy granting immunity to tax 
evaders who voluntarily paid tax liabilities, as long as the government was not 
yet aware of their violations. 
</P>
<P>
The service abolished the formal policy in 1952 due in part to concerns that 
the IRS was still prosecuting anyway. But the agency has since maintained an 
informal policy allowing district offices to offer immunity on a case-by-case 
basis. The informal policy is discussed in numerous tax guides and is endorsed 
by the American Bar Assn. tax section, Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
It also is discussed in the IRS special agents' handbook. The handbook, 
Silverman said, stipulates that the IRS "will carefully consider and weigh the 
voluntary disclosure, along with all other facts and circumstances, in deciding 
whether or not to recommend prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, attorneys may approach the IRS with offers to pay taxes owed 
by clients. The agency in turn will require that, to get immunity, clients must 
not be under current IRS investigation and must not have obtained income from 
illegal sources, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
If authorities later discover that clients obtained income through criminal 
activities such as bookmaking, clients could still be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Also, under a 1974 revision, taxpayers must not have reason to believe that the 
IRS will soon discover their violations. That could occur if, for example, a 
wife negotiating a divorce settlement threatens to report her husband's tax 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
"What you basically do is describe the facts of your client without revealing 
the identity of your client and ask, on the basis of that, would they accept 
this as a voluntary disclosure and not prosecute," Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a perfectly legal method of assisting taxpayers," said Mark D. Pastor, 
an Encino tax attorney and former law partner with Trattner. 
</P>
<P>
Trattner, in an interview, said that 30 to 40 clients have paid about $2 
million in back taxes over the past 11 years through the procedure. Some 
derived income from illegal activities -- and thus technically do not qualify 
for immunity, he said. Nonetheless, they are still paying back taxes 
anonymously, as well as filing current returns under their real identities, 
Trattner said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that they made voluntary disclosures would not bar prosecution" for 
those illegal activities, Trattner said. "But for sympathy purposes, it is not 
likely that a judge would get terribly angry if they attempted to straighten 
out their act in good faith and come forward." 
</P>
<P>
Trattner called the congressional investigations a "kangaroo court charade" for 
implying that his arrangements were the result of special favors. 
</P>
<P>
However, one Southland tax lawyer said the use of partial payments and a secret 
safe deposit could lead to bribery or other abuses. For instance, cash could be 
left in the safe deposit box as a bribe to the IRS agent. 
</P>
<P>
Because the practice is discretionary, with no specific IRS procedures, it 
"could be interpreted as corrupt," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
But Trattner, who was not accused of bribery in the congressional hearings, 
said he has never dealt with individual revenue agents.

NEVER MOLESTED ANYONE, RAY BUCKEY TELLS JURORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly six years after his arrest on child molestation charges, McMartin 
Pre-School teacher Ray Buckey took the stand for the first time on Wednesday 
and denied that he ever molested, threatened or otherwise harmed children. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's testimony, delivered softly but without hesitation under the 
questioning of defense lawyer Danny Davis, directly contradicted the testimony 
of nine of the alleged victims in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Buckey, tanned and wearing a pale yellow shirt, navy blazer and 
khaki slacks, said that his accusers are lying and that he had never even seen 
some of the children before they pointed to him at his preliminary hearing. He 
added that law enforcement has never questioned him about the allegations 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
In 4 1/2 hours on the stand, Buckey answered "no" and "never" to most questions 
posed by Davis about his alleged misconduct: 
</P>
<P>
"(Before becoming a McMartin teacher), did you come over to the preschool and 
perhaps spend some time molesting children . . . or playing naked games?" Davis 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," replied Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever been a member of any type of what might be called a network of 
child molesters" or involved in the production or sale of "kiddie porn?" Davis 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Buckey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever touched a child in any manner whatsoever with your own specific 
intent to arouse or obtain sexual gratification?" Davis asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Never," Buckey said emphatically. He said his only contact with a child's 
genitals was with a washcloth or toilet paper when he helped them clean up 
after bathroom accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Although the alleged molestations dated from 1978, Buckey said he did not begin 
working at his family's nursery school until 1981, and avoided even stopping by 
there before that because he was "dropping in and out" of various colleges and 
didn't want his parents to know he was not attending classes. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of 11 alleged victims named in the case have testified in the 
27-month-long trial that Buckey raped, sodomized, or forced them into oral 
copulation; that he took pornographic photographs of them, transported them off 
the school grounds for orgies and satanic-like rituals in which animals were 
killed, and then silenced them by threatening to kill their parents. A 
physician who examined the youngsters testified that she found physical 
evidence of sexual abuse in most. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's co-defendant, his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, testified in her 
defense for 11 days in May and also denied molesting or mistreating any 
children or having any knowledge of molestations at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has estimated that Buckey will spend about a month on the witness 
stand, began by focusing on Buckey's relationship to the 2 1/2-year-old boy 
whose allegations against "Mr. Ray" triggered the case, now the longest and 
costliest criminal trial in history. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said he had seen the child two or three times, in the school's afternoon 
day care program, but that he had never held, touched, molested or sodomized 
the boy. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever sodomized anybody?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said his strategy is to try to tie Buckey's claim of innocence to the 
"impossibility" that the alleged acts could have occurred, starting with his 
general denials and then focusing on the specific counts involving each child. 
For example, he noted Wednesday, Buckey was not even teaching at the school 
when one of the allegedly molested children was there. 
</P>
<P>
That child, a 12-year-old girl who in August, 1987, became the first alleged 
victim to testify, described being sexually abused and threatened by Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
Her father testified that she attended McMartin from 1977 through mid-1980. 
</P>
<P>
But Buckey testified Wednesday that he he did not even begin work at the school 
until January, 1981, and that his previous visits were as an observer two days 
a week during the last two or three months of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"The preliminary hearing was the first time I ever saw (the girl) in my life," 
said Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin, co-prosecutor in the case, speaking to a 
reporter outside the courtroom afterward, characterized Buckey's responses as 
"mechanical, very rote, and calculated, the result of 5 1/2 years of practicing 
for this moment. There is very little of what he has testified to so far that 
is truthful, and much of it is contradicted by a number of witnesses, even 
defense witnesses." She declined to cite examples, saying, "I'm saving them for 
cross-examination." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and Peggy McMartin Buckey are charged with 65 counts of molestation and 
conspiracy involving 11 children who attended their family-run Manhattan Beach 
nursery school. Both have maintained their innocence from the beginning of the 
case, which mushroomed into a massive investigation that led to charges against 
them and five other teachers, as well as the closure of nine beach-area nursery 
schools. Although all seven McMartin teachers -- including 82-year-old school 
founder Virginia McMartin -- were ordered to stand trial after an 18-month 
preliminary hearing, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner decided to drop charges against all 
but Buckey and his mother, citing weak evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Before beginning his testimony, Buckey, who is free on a $3-million property 
bond, told reporters he was somewhat nervous about beginning his testimony, but 
relieved at finally getting a chance to rebut the charges. He did not testify 
at his preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's fine now that I'm finally up there," he said afterward. "I just 
answer the questions . . . and I have the truth behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Asked by a reporter why he thinks he is charged with 53 counts of molestation 
and conspiracy if, as he maintains, "none of it ever happened," Buckey told 
reporters he believes that children caught up in the complex case were 
influenced by adults and interviewing methods and now "can't turn back." 
</P>
<P>
The $15-million case, now in its third year of trial, has heard from more than 
100 witnesses, resulting in more than 52,000 pages of transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders has characterized the trial 
as a race against time, balancing the defense's desire to present numerous 
additional witnesses against what he fears is "a probability that this case 
will end in a mistrial" because of the dwindling number of jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the original 18 panelists (12 regular jurors and six alternates) have 
been released for health and career problems, and the loss of at least one more 
is looming, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The super-compulsion I have is to get this to a jury," the judge said last 
week, just before emergency gallbladder surgery forced him to release a fifth 
juror, who is expected to be incapacitated for at least a month.

<TEXT>
<P>
At the time, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence 
attracted little notice. A seemingly routine survey of the state of U.S. 
counterintelligence programs, it was appended to an appropriations bill earlier 
this month and all but lost in the daily deluge of paper that flows from 
government printing presses. 
</P>
<P>
"Since its 1986 report on 'Meeting the Espionage Challenge,' the committee has 
catalogued numerous cases of espionage and attempted espionage, some of which 
had devastating consequences for the United States," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
It added, "We also found that many of the actions set in motion in early years 
were faltering as a result of diminishing resources and a lack of continuing 
resolve to deal with them effectively." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bloch Case in Spotlight 
</P>
<P>
Within days, the committee's central conclusions were driven home in one of the 
most extraordinary developments in the long history of spies and counterspies: 
the case of suspected Soviet agent Felix S. Bloch. 
</P>
<P>
And beneath the headlines about Bloch's suspected activities and the bizarre 
television film of caravans of FBI agents following him trunk-and-tail across 
Washington and New York, the case has ignited a major debate within government 
circles about U.S. counterintelligence capabilities and the growing number of 
failures to uncover spies, some of whom have gone undetected for more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the nation's counterintelligence program appears so overburdened that 
former KGB agent Stanislav Levchencko, who defected to the United States in 
1979, said this week that he was only surprised that American spies at the 
State Department had not been uncovered earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lax for Decades' 
</P>
<P>
"It is no secret that the security system at the State Department has been lax 
for decades," Levchencko declared. "Professional logic would indicate that 
there are at least two or three more spies still operating inside the State 
Department who have not yet been found." 
</P>
<P>
If Levchencko is a less than dispassionate judge, even a senior former U.S. 
intelligence analyst conceded that "historically, counterintelligence has never 
been an American forte." 
</P>
<P>
Current and former intelligence officials say their ability to track down 
Americans spying for other governments either in the United States or abroad is 
hampered by an inefficient and underfunded system. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is clearly the dispersed nature of responsibility for 
counterespionage. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, responsibility for tracking down spies inside the United States 
rests with the FBI. The CIA is widely considered to be responsible for 
counterintelligence operations overseas. The State Department's Diplomatic 
Security Office, a relatively new office, is charged with security at 
diplomatic installations abroad. The Defense Department has parallel 
responsibility for military installations in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, there are yawning gaps in the net. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA concentrates on watching for penetration of U.S. security by foreign 
agents -- the bugging of embassies, for example, and terrorist threats; it 
gives less attention to the activities of Americans spying on the United States 
overseas. The State Department and Pentagon efforts are similarly defensive: 
They concentrate most of their resources on protecting American personnel and 
facilities from outside threats. 
</P>
<P>
Even at the basic gate-keeping level of controlling access to sensitive 
material, the problems are staggering and the government effort limited, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4 million Americans have official security clearances and 
therefore have access to classified documents of varying degrees of 
sensitivity. But the budget for screening those receiving such clearances has 
been cut back in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The screening system itself is antiquated and inconsistent, officials add. The 
procedure is so limited, one counterintelligence specialist charged, "that the 
average applicant is likely to be more thoroughly checked for a mortgage than 
for a security clearance." 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of security checks do not go much beyond verification of background 
information, checking references and determining that the subject has no police 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Questioning friends or neighbors, or sending agents door to door to investigate 
the private life styles or habits of individuals in sensitive positions is 
unrealistic and beyond the budget resources of most agencies, said one Justice 
Department official. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people used to argue that the polygraph (lie detector) was the answer 
-- then you would have no need of background checks. But then they found that 
the polygraph was not foolproof, so it was not an answer," said Americo R. 
Cinquegrana, deputy counsel for intelligence policy at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
"There is still debate over which techniques are the most effective." 
</P>
<P>
The last two executive orders establishing general criteria for employment by 
the federal government were issued by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 
1950s, when the Cold War raged and most espionage was linked to ideological 
sympathy with communism. Accordingly, security checks tended to concentrate on 
a search for links to suspected groups and organizations -- often in earlier 
stages of the subject's life. 
</P>
<P>
Today's spies have been linked largely to financial gain or entrapment tied to 
sexual activity, but counterespionage programs have not been modified to meet 
the changing nature of the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do more than a dozen different agencies now use different criteria and 
methods but follow-up investigations also are limited and sporadic. 
</P>
<P>
"Most spies were recruited after they joined government, not before," said one 
former intelligence official. "With little follow-up, that means they can go 
undetected unless they slip up or someone informs on them." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, several of the cases uncovered in the 1980s, now referred to as the 
"decade of the spy," were due to informants or through accidents. The only 
known evidence against Bloch, a videotape of him handing what is believed to be 
a briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris, was "inadvertent," according to State 
Department sources. The Soviet citizen was being watched, not Bloch. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the activities of John Walker Jr., a Navy chief warrant officer who 
spied for the Soviets for 18 years, were uncovered only after his wife went to 
the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Our counterintelligence is better than it was in the 1970s, but the U.S. is 
showing that it is not up to the task of counterintelligence in the 1990s and 
apparently not of the 1980s, especially if we're not able to find a guy after 
10 years," said Kenneth E. deGraffenreid, a former senior director of 
intelligence at the National Security Council who is now at the National 
Strategy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch's alleged espionage for the Soviet Union reportedly may date back a 
decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
Critics lay blame for counterintelligence failures on the executive branch, 
which they charge has virtually ignored every official assessment outlining 
weaknesses in the counterspy program since a wave of spies was uncovered in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"For four years, the government has been aware that there is a real problem 
with espionage by Americans," said Allen Adler, a former counterintelligence 
specialist at the American Civil Liberties Union. "And there has been 
sufficient evidence to give advance warning in each of the cases over the past 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"But the government has not heeded any recommendations that have come out of 
Congress or various commissions within the Department of Defense and other 
agencies to determine what can be done to prevent these problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Congress recommended cutting back on both the volume of data 
classified and the number of people given clearances. But Adler and other 
counterintelligence specialists say both the Reagan and Bush administrations 
have failed to adopt the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many people who have access to classified data, but it is a 
function of the amount of data classified," said Cinquegrana of the Justice 
Department. Both government officials and critics agreed that the United States 
classifies far too much information that is not politically or militarily 
sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
Explained DeGraffenreid, who worked in the Reagan Administration: 
"Counterintelligence has become a backwater of bureaucratic inertia and 
lethargy. They're comfortable with the way things have been done in the past, 
and they don't want to be told by others how to do it better." 
</P>
<P>
The price of U.S. counterintelligence weaknesses is likely to rise, experts 
say, because the Soviet Union is upgrading its already formidable foreign 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
Levchencko said that, contrary to popular conception, the Soviet policy of 
glasnost, or openness, has actually led to a greater need for foreign 
intelligence than during the Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev "is more pragmatic. But with the collapse 
of industry and the economy, he is also forced to cut large parts of the 
budget, even for the military. To compensate, he has to keep up with what the 
United States and the West are doing. He relies on intelligence more than ever 
so the Soviet Union is not left vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
Added DeGraffenreid, "The Soviets are showing an ability to penetrate a new 
range (of government agencies), from the military to the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
"These are major kinds of spies, not chicken-feed triple agents. It shows that 
it's not only the low-level spies who hurt you, like Walker, who gave away 
codes. If this (Bloch case) is all true, as it appears to be, then this is a 
really big, big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Even if no arrests are made in the current case, the allegations already have 
triggered congressional interest in increasing the resources available to U.S. 
counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the Soviets have had a certain amount of success in buying 
traitorous Americans would indicate that we should put more resources into 
counterintelligence," Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.) said.

AUDIT DETAILING METRO RAIL WOES SPARKS NEW TURF WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reacting to an alarming new audit that shows Metro Rail at least four months 
behind schedule and $135 million over budget, Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission officials moved Wednesday to wrest control of the troubled subway 
project away from the Southern California Rapid Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Peterson, executive director of the commission, called for the creation of 
a single rail construction agency that would act as a subsidiary of the 
commission, supervising construction of Metro Rail and all other county rail 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD, calling the move a "political" act, countered with its own audit that 
showed sizable, but smaller, cost overruns in the construction of the first 
4.4-mile leg of the subway. 
</P>
<P>
The dueling audits amounted to opening salvos in what could mean a bitter turf 
war between the two agencies over ultimate authority for Metro Rail's 
construction. When completed, the subway will stretch from downtown Los Angeles 
to North Hollywood, a distance of about 16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said at a news conference that he also plans to ask members of a Metro 
Rail budget oversight panel to order major changes in the RTD's management and 
planning of the subway program. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said the Cost Reduction Panel has the authority to cut 
costs when budget overruns exceed 10% of their original estimates -- the exact 
figure of Metro Rail cost overruns reported by the new county audit. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county audit, conducted by the independent firm of Deloitte/Kellog 
Joint Venture, used the dry language of accountants to dampen its dire message, 
Peterson sternly warned that inflated costs in the Metro Rail project have 
already passed 10% of the $1.3 billion project. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't take immediate control of the budget and project schedule, we have 
been advised that (the situation is) likely to deteriorate even more," Peterson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to blunt the impact of the county audit, the RTD responded by issuing 
its own figures showing more modest cost overruns of between 5% and 8% of the 
agency's original budget. 
</P>
<P>
"By our consultant study," said RTD Board President Gordana Swanson, Metro Rail 
"will not be $135 million over the original budget but somewhere between $64 
and $102 million. We make no excuses for this." 
</P>
<P>
Swanson questioned the commission's figures, calling them "blatantly untrue 
statements." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the rhetoric, the RTD's admission of cost overruns marked the first 
time the agency has admitted that major impediments exist to Metro Rail's 
progress. In the past, the RTD has insisted that the project would be completed 
within its original budget and that subway service would start by September, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, RTD officials acknowledged Wednesday that continuing difficulties 
could delay the start of service of the first leg of Metro Rail by as much as 
nine months. The RTD originally projected that the first phase of Metro Rail 
construction would be finished by April, 1992, then revised that date to 
September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson insisted that "a number of changes" would be necessary to minimize the 
overruns and delays. But she and other RTD officials said the Transportation 
Commission lacks "the expertise or quality to manage funding or construction 
for rail." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the agencies have escalated their criticism of each other 
over how deeply the subway construction project is mired in difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
While the RTD has consistently defended its approach, the commission has 
insisted that control over the project should be withdrawn from the district. 
The commission has even gone as far as promoting a state Senate bill that would 
eliminate the RTD and place administration of Southern California's transit 
lines in the hands of the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joint Financing 
</P>
<P>
Under current contracts, the commission will own the subway and the RTD will 
operate the lines. It is financed by federal and local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But Peterson's call Wednesday to strip the RTD of its control of Metro Rail was 
the strongest yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we take action now, the potential for future problems is much greater," 
Peterson said. "There's no likelihood of change unless we make these changes 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he hopes that the RTD will agree to his call for a new subsidiary 
agency. The agency would ensure "that 70 cents of every dollar is going to 
construction," he said, "not 50 cents as is the case today." 
</P>
<P>
Before such an agency could be created, the commission would need either 
support from the city and RTD or the elimination of the transit district, a 
move being considered in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Even if those steps are not taken, Peterson said he is already taking steps to 
get action from the Metro Rail budget oversight panel. The panel, which 
consists of representatives of the Transportation Commission, the RTD and the 
city, can reduce costs if overruns exceed 10% of the original $1.3-billion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that even if the RTD member on the Cost Reduction 
Panel disagrees with the need for action, the other two members can force the 
agency to make changes. 
</P>
<P>
"The RTD has to go along with what the majority on the panel agrees to," said 
Richard Stanger, the commission's director of rail development. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated calls to Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Mike Gage for comment on the city's 
position went unreturned. 
</P>
<P>
But City Councilman Nate Holden, who has in the past warned of cost overruns, 
blamed the RTD for Metro Rail's problems, saying: "We have to hold someone 
responsible for mismanagement." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's audit concluded that the RTD management of Metro Rail was 
riddled with duplicated effort and "worked against timely decision making." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the political complications facing those overseeing the Metro Rail 
project are rising complaints from many of the subway project's contractors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow to Pay 
</P>
<P>
The contractors hired to carry out drilling, tunneling, earth-moving and 
structural shoring-up work in the Metro Rail project have criticized RTD's 
management for reacting slowly to their claims for more compensation for work 
already completed. 
</P>
<P>
Webster G. Wiley, president of Foundation Excavation, a firm that handled all 
the excavation and earth recompaction for the subway's main maintenance shop 
building, was pessimistic about the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how they can get it under budget," Wiley said, expressing 
bitterness at claims for compensation that have gone unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
"They hate each other," Wiley said of the two transportation agencies. "They're 
both clowns."

Prince Norodom Sihanouk announced that four warring Cambodian factions who 
broke off peace talks earlier this week are to meet again today in Paris. 
However, French radio later quoted aides to the resistance leader as saying 
that the new session has been called off because Sihanouk is angry that French 
Premier Michel Rocard agreed to meet Cambodian Premier Hun Sen.

African heads of state, ending a three-day Organization of African Unity summit 
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, said the size of U.N. peacekeeping forces in Namibia 
is inadequate to guarantee even the minimum conditions for free and fair 
elections. They also asked the U.N. Security Council to order South Africa to 
halt intimidation of voters in advance of Namibia's pre-independence balloting 
Nov. 6. There are 4,650 U.N. troops in Namibia, far below the 7,500 recommended 
by the Security Council in 1978. The 49-nation African group also called for 
Western nations to emulate the United States and France and write off the 
continent's crushing $230-billion foreign debt.

Global emissions of carbon dioxide -- the main pollutant associated with global 
warming -- rose for the fourth consecutive year in 1987 and developing nations 
had the biggest growth, a federal scientist said. Worldwide, carbon dioxide 
emissions from the burning of oil, coal and gas by power plants, factories and 
motor vehicles increased to an all-time high of 5.65 billion tons, up 1.43% 
from the 1986 levels of 5.57 billion tons, Gregg Marland, a staff scientist at 
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee. Marland said U.S. emissions rose 1.92% in 1987 and preliminary 
estimates show another 3% jump in 1988. He said the highest rate of growth in 
carbon dioxide emissions occurred in South and Southeast Asia, a 6.2% increase 
over 1986 levels. Carbon dioxide is considered a primary contributor to the 
greenhouse effect -- a predicted warming of the Earth by the accumulation of 
gases in the atmosphere.

'PERSONALIZED' BIRTH CERTIFICATES WILL FUND CHILD ABUSE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Native Californians will now be able to obtain a "personalized" decorative 
birth certificate from the state in a new effort to raise money for child abuse 
programs, the Deukmejian Administration announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fancy, multicolored birth certificates will sell for $30 apiece, with half 
the proceeds going to the California Children's Trust Fund. State officials 
said they expect to raise about $375,000 a year for the trust fund, which 
subsidizes a variety of child abuse programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate beneficiaries of the program are needy children," said Bob 
Taylor, associate secretary of the state Health and Welfare Agency, in 
announcing the start of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the California "Heirloom Birth Certificate" was borrowed from 
Oregon, which has been offering such designer certificates for several years. 
It also is similar to California's popular personalized license plate program, 
which raises about $20 million a year for environmental projects. 
</P>
<P>
The birth certificate, measuring 11 by 14 inches, includes the name of the 
person, his or her parents and the date and county of birth. It bears a gold 
state seal and drawings of five state symbols, including the California golden 
poppy and the extinct California grizzly bear. 
</P>
<P>
The state is marketing the certificate as a gift item, particularly for parents 
and grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all unique individuals," says a state brochure advertising the program. 
"Each with our own identity. And each with a birth certificate that 
commemorates the celebration of life. Which is one of the reasons California is 
offering a personalized legal birth certificate." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone can order a certificate commemorating the birth of another person, since 
birth certificates are a matter of public record in California. The certificate 
is valid as legal identification but does not contain such information as the 
time of birth or the baby's weight. 
</P>
<P>
The certificates will not be available for anyone born before 1905, because the 
state did not keep birth records before that time. They can be ordered from the 
Department of Health Services, Office of the State Registrar, in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield), who carried legislation creating the program, 
was the state's first customer. He bought nine birth certificates, most of them 
for his children and family members. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, I guess, rank does have its privileges," Rogers joked at a 
press conference to announce the new designer certificates. 
</P>
<P>
But the senator, an unabashed booster of the program, noted that he could not 
obtain one for himself because he was not born in California. "I can't even get 
one of these," Rogers said. "I would love to have one but I can't because I was 
born in Louisiana."

ABORTION DEBATE IN COURT FOCUSES ON CONSENT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a new round in the intensifying debate over abortion, a state Court of 
Appeal was asked Wednesday to uphold the constitutionality of a 1987 law 
requiring unmarried minors to get the consent of a parent or a judge before 
obtaining an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
A state attorney defending the statute urged the panel to set aside a lower 
court injunction that blocked implementation of the law before it could take 
effect last year. 
</P>
<P>
Minors do not have the same right to sexual privacy as adults and the law 
serves a "significant state interest," said state Deputy Atty. Gen. Elisabeth 
C. Brandt. An immature minor, she said, too often rejects childbirth without 
adequate consultation and "goes through the process with anyone who will take 
her money and give her an abortion." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a long-term benefit in involving the parent," said Brandt. "There is 
evidence that young minors tend to panic and give in to peer pressure. They 
think, 'My parents will kill me; my boyfriend will kill me; I'll lose my 
figure. I have to get an abortion.' " 
</P>
<P>
But a San Francisco lawyer representing medical and civil rights groups 
challenging the law urged the panel to leave the injunction intact and allow 
existing statutes -- which require only that a doctor obtain the minor's 
"informed consent" -- to continue to govern the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Minors do not have less privacy rights than adults," said Attorney Linda E. 
Shostak , and the new law thus violates the privacy guarantees of the state 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature took a system that works pretty well . . . and changed it to 
criminalize abortion for teen-agers, unless they get consent of a parent or 
judge," said Shostak. 
</P>
<P>
The panel heard argument for an hour on the politically charged issue, pressing 
the attorneys with dozens of questions and, on occasion, appearing skeptical 
about the validity of the 1987 law. 
</P>
<P>
Appellate Justice William A Newsom said he saw "serious problems" in the law's 
requirement that judges determine whether a minor is "mature" enough for an 
abortion. In that respect, the statute may be impermissibly vague and force 
judges to act without advice from psychologists or other experts, the justice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Presiding Justice John T. Racanelli expressed concern that the law 
might be discriminatory by requiring minors seeking abortions to go through 
legal procedures not required of minors choosing to give birth. "Aren't they 
being treated unequally?" Racanelli asked. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was held in one of two cases now before the appeal court that could 
change the state's legal course on abortion. The second case under review is a 
challenge by civil rights groups to the validity of the most recent legislative 
budget restrictions on state-funded abortions in the Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Court Decision 
</P>
<P>
The heated debate over the issue has taken on new intensity after a ruling by 
the U.S. Supreme Court on July 3 giving states more power to limit abortion 
under the federal Constitution. While the decision did not change California 
law, it refueled hopes among anti-abortion groups that past state rulings will 
be modified or overturned. 
</P>
<P>
The law at issue Wednesday requires unmarried minors to obtain the consent 
either of a parent, guardian or a judge, unless there is a medical emergency. 
The statute mandates confidential and expedited proceedings -- free of charge 
and appealable to higher courts -- and requires that judges must approve 
abortions if they conclude that the minor is sufficiently mature and informed 
to consent to the operation or that an abortion is in her "best interest." 
</P>
<P>
The decision in the case will have wide impact. Of about 300,000 abortions 
performed annually in California, an estimated 35,000 involve unmarried minors. 
A ruling is due by October. 
</P>
<P>
The statute was first challenged in November, 1987, two months before the law 
was to go into effect, when the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups 
represented by the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit in San Francisco, 
charging that it violated the state constitutional right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1987, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Morton R. Colvin issued 
an injunction preventing the law from going into effect while its legality was 
tested in the courts.

AFFLUENT WOMEN TWICE AS LIKELY AS POOR TO HAVE CESAREAN BIRTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Affluent women are nearly twice as likely to have their babies delivered by 
Cesarean section than are poor women, a study of 245,854 births in Los Angeles 
County has found. 
</P>
<P>
Women whose median household income was greater than $30,000 had a 22.9% rate 
of first-time Cesarean sections, compared to 13.2% among women whose household 
income was less than $11,000, the study reported today in the New England 
Journal of Medicine. Overall, the rate was 17.8%. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy in part reflects doctors' fears that affluent patients will sue 
them if there are problems involving vaginal deliveries, according to one of 
the UC Berkeley researchers who conducted the study. "I think that physicians 
are under tremendous pressure from very articulate patients and also from the 
threat of litigation," said Dr. Jeffrey B. Gould, professor and chairman of 
maternal and child health at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity held up even when the researchers took into account age, 
ethnicity, race, previous pregnancies, the baby's birth weight and whether 
there were complications reported during labor. Indeed, a third of the Cesarean 
births occurred in women whose doctors reported no complications at all, the 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
The report represents another indicator of what has been a widely acknowledged 
problem in recent years, unnecessary Cesarean sections in the United States. 
The rate skyrocketed from 5.5% in 1970 to 24.1% by 1986. In California, it was 
24.5% in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Nader's Public Citizen Health Research Group, which has studied the issue 
in depth, estimates an optimal Cesarean rate at 12%. 
</P>
<P>
The latest study was done to try to shed light on "this topsy-turvy result of 
affluent women who are supposed to be more healthy requiring more in the way of 
medical intervention," Gould said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Specific on Reasons 
</P>
<P>
Gould and co-authors Becky Davey and Randall S. Stafford were not specific in 
their report about possible reasons for the socioeconomic differences in 
Cesarean rates. In an interview, however, Gould suggested that the primary 
reasons are doctors' fear of malpractice suits and delayed childbearing by 
"yuppie" patients who are more inclined to sue if a birth goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cesarean operations increase the chance of infection and death in the 
mother, in some situations they reduce the chance of damage to the baby during 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
"The norm among affluent women is to have as good a baby as possible, not to 
take any risks. You wait this long to have a baby, you want the best possible 
outcome," Gould said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, poor patients are more likely to deliver at a teaching hospital or 
at a hospital with few resources, he said. Both are environments with positive 
reinforcement for avoiding unnecessary surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
A Times analysis last year found that 41 hospitals in California had Cesarean 
rates higher than 30%, with these high rates more likely at hospitals serving 
affluent patients. The lowest rates were at teaching hospitals, which often 
employ second opinions, and in health maintenance organization hospitals. For 
example, County-USC Medical Center had a 13.6% rate in 1986 and Kaiser 
Foundation hospitals had rates ranging from 14% to 24%. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe of the Public Interest Health Research Group said he lays 
more blame on the fact that, except in a situation such as Kaiser's, Cesareans 
make more money for both physicians and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said he has confidence in the Gould study's results, but said he wishes 
the researchers had used other available data to point out specific reasons for 
the socioeconomic differences in Cesarean rates and to recommend remedial 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Gould does have advice for women who want to avoid unnecessary Cesarean 
sections: "You should go deliver at a facility, or engage an obstetrician, who 
requires a second opinion prior to a Cesarean section; where there is a very 
clearly defined set of criteria for those circumstances that require a Cesarean 
section, and where every case is reviewed by a panel of nurses and physicians." 
</P>
<P>
These measures have been shown to reduce a hospital's excess Cesarean rate, he 
and Wolfe agreed. 
</P>

AN END OF FEAR;

CHINESE NATIONAL GRANTED ASYLUM IN BIRTH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VALARIE BASHEDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chinese national who fled because he feared persecution for violating China's 
birth-control regulations has been granted political asylum in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Yun Pan Lee, 26, won permission to stay after San Francisco Immigration Judge 
Bernard Hornbach determined that he would face harsh treatment if he returned 
to China, where his wife had been discovered in hiding and was forced to abort 
a pregnancy in the fifth month, Lee's attorney, Jon Wu, said. The ruling was 
rare, Wu said, in that Chinese nationals seeking asylum on grounds of possible 
reprisals for their opposition to the country's "one-child" rule have regularly 
been turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Wu said Lee, a carpenter who was staying in San Francisco and is currently 
working in New York City, lived for months with the fear that he might be 
deported and frequently cried when he showed the attorney pictures of his wife 
and two sons. 
</P>
<P>
"When the judge granted asylum, he got on his knees and bowed to the ground," 
Wu said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was arrested at San Francisco International Airport last October on charges 
that he was carrying a forged passport. He was kept in jail until February when 
Hornbach ruled favorably on his application for asylum. However, objections 
were raised by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which appealed the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The INS dropped the appeal last month. The announcement that Lee faced no more 
hurdles in his attempt to gain asylum was made Wednesday in Washington by Sen. 
William Armstrong (R-Colo). 
</P>
<P>
Lee fled China last year after his wife became pregnant with a third child. Lee 
said the pregnancy was unintentional. The couple had already been punished 
because of an earlier accidental pregnancy in 1981, Wu said. 
</P>
<P>
"They took away his work assignment, cut off his electricity, imposed fines and 
cut off his food rations," Wu said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lee urged his wife to have an abortion after the second accidental 
pregnancy in 1988, as a Roman Catholic she did not believe in abortion and 
wanted to bear the child, Wu said. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that they would face further persecution for that decision, Lee decided 
to seek another home for his family while his wife went into hiding to have the 
child. But a villager reported Lee's wife to Chinese authorities, who then 
forced her to have an abortion, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Wu said he is working to reunite Lee and his family in the United States. 
Because Lee has been granted asylum, he can eventually seek citizenship, making 
it easier to bring his family here to join him, assuming that they are able to 
emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
"I've received a lot of tearful letters from his wife saying, 'Thank you for 
this, you've brought us peace and harmony,"' Wu said. 
</P>
<P>
Wu said he is in the process of contacting the U.S. consul general in 
Gwangzhou, near Lee's family home in Fuzhou, about getting Lee's family out of 
China. However, he said that might be difficult because Chinese officials 
probably consider Lee a counterrevolutionary.

CASTRO ASSAILS BUSH AS 'ARROGANT' ON COMMUNIST WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

CAMAGUEY, Cuba 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stunned by a devastating government drug scandal at home and admittedly worried 
about democratic ferment in the Communist world, Cuban leader Fidel Castro on 
Wednesday excoriated President Bush for his "arrogance" in forecasting the 
decline of world socialism. 
</P>
<P>
Castro was especially scornful of Bush's recent visits to Poland and Hungary, 
which he suggested were cynical attempts "to encourage capitalist trends that 
have developed there and political problems that have come up there." 
</P>
<P>
"Never has any (U.S.) Administration, not even (Ronald) Reagan's, been as 
triumphant as this one regarding the difficulties in the socialist camp," 
Castro complained to a rain-soaked crowd of many thousands here to celebrate 
the 36th anniversary of the start of the Cuban revolution. 
</P>
<P>
As the Cuban president lashed out at the Bush Administration, America's ranking 
diplomat in Cuba, John J. Taylor, pointedly arose from the diplomatic section 
of the speakers platform and walked out. Taylor also walked out on a speech 
last January when Castro hurled insults at then-President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Castro appeared particularly incensed by what he called "the euphoria of 
imperialism" over ferment in the Communist world. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush Administration in the last few months has made statements based on 
the premise that the sun is setting on socialism or that socialism will end on 
the dust heap of history that was reserved for capitalism," said the bearded 
leader, seemingly impervious to the rainfall that soaked his familiar green 
fatigue uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if tomorrow we wake up to the news of a civil war in the U.S.S.R., even 
if tomorrow we wake up to the news that the U.S.S.R. has disintegrated -- a 
thing we don't expect to happen -- even under those circumstances, the Cuban 
people will continue fighting," he said, grimly citing the current ethnic 
conflicts and labor unrest in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But in an unusually candid section of his nearly two-hour speech, Castro 
acknowledged that he is worried about the Soviet Union's continued ability to 
support Cuba, to which it currently gives between $5 billion and $7 billion in 
economic aid each year. 
</P>
<P>
"There are difficulties in the revolutionary world," he said in a grave tone. 
"We cannot even say with certainty that the supplies that have been coming to 
our country will continue to arrive with the clocklike punctuality and as 
guaranteed as they have before." 
</P>
<P>
Castro was particularly caustic toward the Solidarity opposition movement in 
Poland and the Hungarian democratic opposition for the way they greeted Bush 
with anti-Communist banners during his recent tour. 
</P>
<P>
"It is truly bitter, but this increases Bush's euphoria and increases his 
triumphalism," Castro said. "It increases imperialism's hostility against Cuba, 
and it increases Mr. Bush's theory that socialism is going to its downfall. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bush thinks socialism is in decline . . . why should he change his policies 
toward Cuba? 
</P>
<P>
"That's why he is more arrogant than ever before," Castro added. 
</P>
<P>
Castro vowed that no matter what happens to the rest of the Communist world, 
Cuba will never give up, even in the face of a blockade or war and occupation 
by American troops. "Sooner or later, the price would be so high for the 
aggressors they would have to get out," he vowed. 
</P>
<P>
An American diplomat who heard the speech dismissed Castro's raising of such 
threats as unimaginable. 
</P>
<P>
"He's extremely worried about the democratization movement in Eastern Europe 
and can only call up the specter of the Bay of Pigs invasion 28 years ago," the 
diplomat said, referring to the failed assault on Cuba by U.S.-backed rightist 
exiles. He said Castro appears to be seeking a diversion in order to avoid 
talking about his own problems at home. 
</P>
<P>
Castro failed even to mention the drug scandal that has absorbed all of Cuba 
for the last month. Four top military and intelligence officers were executed 
and 10 others received long prison sentences for trafficking cocaine across 
Cuba to the United States. The accused officers and other government figures 
also have been charged with a dolce vita life style involving sex parties and 
financial corruption.

'SOCIETY CRUMBLING' AMID FEAR AND BLOODSHED IN SRI LANKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

KALUTARA, Sri Lanka 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gruesome remains smoldered outside the tea shop for more than 12 hours 
before finally being removed by police. It was the body of a young man with a 
gasoline-soaked truck tire bound to his chest and set ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
The flaming body was dumped along Sri Lanka's main coastal road for all to see, 
as a message from the nation's security forces, the old man who runs the tea 
shop explained, adding that to give his name would be to risk his life. 
</P>
<P>
The message: Don't fight us, or you will be next. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the only such message along the palm-lined road this week. A few 
miles to the north, three similarly bound bodies also smoldered in the summer 
sun, symbols of the violence that is driving this Indian Ocean island nation to 
economic and political ruin. 
</P>
<P>
As Sri Lanka faces a deepening confrontation with India in a desperate effort 
to put down an ethnic insurgency in the island's northern region, an even 
bloodier counterinsurgency continues to consume the government in the south. 
</P>
<P>
In the last six weeks alone, at least 1,500 people have been shot, beheaded or 
tortured to death. An estimated 10,000 have been jailed since President 
Ranasinghe Premadasa declared a state of emergency last month to crack down on 
the leftist counterinsurgency. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere you look, everywhere you go, there is this fear psychosis," a Sri 
Lankan diplomat said. "A tiny rumor paralyzes Colombo (the capital) for an 
entire day or more. And everywhere, you hear the same thing: 'There is no 
future here.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the words of another diplomat: "The country really is falling apart. It's a 
society that's crumbling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lines at Embassies 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers carrying automatic rifles are seen everywhere on city streets, country 
roads and village lanes. Lines of people trying to get out of the country form 
daily at the U.S. and European embassies, and the visa seekers tell horror 
stories of being wounded or threatened. 
</P>
<P>
The most immediate crisis in a nation once so idyllic that Mark Twain dubbed it 
"Serendip" is in the north, where the six-year-old war with armed members of 
Sri Lanka's Tamil minority has divided the island in two. 
</P>
<P>
Premadasa, in a fit of anger and frustration, last month demanded that India 
withdraw its 50,000 troops from the northern third of the island. They 
constitute a "peacekeeping force" that Premadasa's predecessor allowed into Sri 
Lanka in a desperate effort to end the Tamil struggle for a separate homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Premadasa set this Saturday as the deadline for the withdrawal, which he 
believes is crucial to putting down the potentially more devastating 
counterinsurgency by the majority Sinhalese in the south -- a guerrilla war 
that has been fueled in part by India's military presence in the north. 
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has flatly refused to pull out. Gandhi, who 
is facing an election this year and hopes to win the support of the 60 million 
Tamils in India, insists that if the troops withdraw, Sri Lanka's 
Sinhalese-dominated security forces will slaughter the island's Tamils. Many 
analysts here agree. 
</P>
<P>
Although the controversy has bolstered charges that India is acting 
increasingly like a regional bully, Premadasa has been criticized by diplomats, 
Sri Lankan analysts and his own party leaders for acting rashly and hinting at 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Few analysts in Sri Lanka believe that war is possible between the two 
mismatched countries. India has the fourth-largest army in the world, and Sri 
Lanka's combined military forces are smaller than India's peacekeeping 
contingent. 
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and many Sri Lankan officials said Premadasa's stubborn stance 
illustrates a streak of irrationality that is helping drive his country into 
chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Indian officials insist that Premadasa, who emphasizes his grass-roots origins 
and Buddhist beliefs, has gone mad. 
</P>
<P>
Citing recent speeches in which Premadasa pledged to publicly immolate himself 
in an effort to save his nation, one senior Indian official said: "It's more 
than odd. It's crazy. We can't help but come to the conclusion that the man is 
touched. And no one accepts the fact that Premadasa is in control. The 
(Sinhalese insurgents) are more in control than he is." 
</P>
<P>
On that point, it seems, nearly everyone in Colombo agrees -- on that and the 
fact that the Sinhalese insurgency by the leftist People's Liberation Front 
that began in the south will continue to be Sri Lanka's most critical issue 
regardless of the outcome of this week's conflict. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Isolated From Society 
</P>
<P>
Some of Premadasa's Cabinet ministers say privately that he has become isolated 
from every major element in Sri Lankan society, including members of both 
ethnic groups, his own party members and senior military commanders. 
</P>
<P>
Even Buddhist monks, traditionally the conscience of Sri Lankan society, have 
turned on Premadasa in large numbers. More than 5,000 of them took to the 
streets Monday, carrying signs attacking the government and pledging to fight 
alongside the Sinhalese rebels. The Sinhalese are predominantly Buddhist; the 
Tamils are Hindu. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the principal beneficiary of the political vacuum has been the 
People's Liberation Front, a highly secretive movement that is structured along 
Marxist lines but is a populist insurgency that uses fear as a method of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
In the south, where the Sinhalese rebel movement began, it is the front that 
imposes curfews, adjudicates disputes, punishes criminal offenders, taxes 
businesses and, in general, is the government. 
</P>
<P>
With such dramatic growth of what the Sri Lankans now call their 
"sub-government," the Sri Lankan economy -- once so promising that analysts 
expected this to become another Singapore -- is now a disaster area. 
Unemployment is nearing 40% in the south and 50% in the north. 
</P>
<P>
But it is in the area of human rights that the desperation of Premadasa's 
policies can be seen most starkly -- instances such as the body burnings that 
have become so commonplace in recent months. On the average, diplomats and Sri 
Lankan officials say, there are 40 political killings a day, many of them 
carried out by government security forces. 
</P>
<P>
Kalutara, a 45-minute drive south of the capital, is believed to be on the 
cutting edge of the People's Liberation Front's steady march toward Colombo. 
</P>
<P>
At the tea shop where the body smoldered, the old shopkeeper summed up the 
nation's reaction to the deepening turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"It is fear," he said, nodding toward where the corpse lay. "Fear of both 
sides, all sides. We cannot speak. We cannot even pick up such a thing and give 
it a decent burial. If you pick it up today, it will be you tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
At the local police station, the deputy superintendent said his officers had no 
choice but to leave bodies at the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a poor country," he said, "and we lack the facilities." 
</P>
<P>
When asked who had burned the bodies, he smiled and shrugged, looking away from 
the half-dozen truck tires stacked beside two large gasoline drums a few feet 
from the front door of his police station.

U.S. QUERYING 10 AUSTRIANS ABOUT BLOCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. investigators have asked Austrian officials and political figures, 
including Foreign Minister Alois Mock, to supply information about the 
activities of Felix S. Bloch from 1981 to 1987, when he served in Vienna, 
Austrian officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities, they said, have given the names of 10 people to Interior 
Minister Hans Loeschnak along with a request that they be asked to describe 
their relations with Bloch. They were asked specifically to describe the type 
of questions he asked in social settings. 
</P>
<P>
All 10 are believed to have been in contact with Bloch, who is under suspicion 
in Washington of spying for the Soviet Union when he was the No. 2 U.S. 
diplomat in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Good Job' 
</P>
<P>
"These were all top people in government," a senior official in the Foreign 
Ministry said. "All it shows is that Mr. Bloch did a very good job in his six 
years here." 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how the request fits into the investigation of Bloch's possible 
involvement in espionage activities. Bloch has not been charged with any 
offense, but he has been suspended from his duties in the State Department 
pending the outcome of the investigation by the FBI and the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side has asked 10 people to make an account of their relations with 
Bloch," a spokesman for Mock said. "Of course, it is in our interest to 
cooperate with that request." 
</P>
<P>
But Interior Minister Loeschnak has not yet committed the Austrian government 
to giving the information to the Americans. He described it as an "internal 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
The Vienna newspaper Die Presse named six officials it said were on the 
American list, including Conservative Party leader Mock, a longtime personal 
friend of Bloch, and Socialist Party parliamentary leader Heinz Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
Others were Peter Jankowitsch, the Socialist Party foreign policy spokesman; 
Heinrich Neissler, a former Cabinet minister; Manfred Scheich, a Foreign 
Ministry official who serves as liaison with the European Economic Community, 
and Eva Nowotny, a foreign policy adviser to the chancellor, the head of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The largely sensationalist Austrian press has been having a field day with the 
Bloch affair, linking the diplomat with practically every controversial event 
of the past decade, ranging from the 1985 sale of artillery to Iran to the 
controversy over President Kurt Waldheim, who is barred from the United States 
for his alleged role in Nazi war crimes in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The Kronen Zeitung referred to a report, substantiated in part by Austrian 
government officials, that Bloch had a long relationship with an unidentified 
Viennese woman. 
</P>
<P>
The "spy's girlfriend," Kronen Zeitung said, has been vacationing in Egypt and 
will be interviewed upon her return to Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The headline over the story said: "FBI Asks Austrians for Help; Spy's Viennese 
Girlfriend Escapes to Egypt." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Austrian officials were informed of the Bloch investigation by U.S. 
Ambassador Henry A. Grunwald two weeks before it became public. Some Austrian 
officials said they were frustrated because the U.S. authorities have neither 
brought charges against Bloch nor cleared him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'So Many Doubts' 
</P>
<P>
"The only evidence we have on our side," one official said, "is that a U.S. 
ambassador walks in and says that something nasty is going on. If a U.S. 
ambassador says something like that, you expect something to happen. Now the 
whole thing seems very much in the dark. There are so many doubts about whether 
(Bloch) is guilty or not. The uncertainty has damaged the credibility of both 
the United States and Austria." 
</P>
<P>
After recent statements here by former U.S. Ambassador Helene von Damm that 
depicted Vienna as a hotbed of espionage, Vienna Mayor Helmut Zilk decided to 
fight back with a statement to the press. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," he said, "historically Vienna is a popular place for spies. But New 
York has many more."

"She may have charisma power," the man said, "but she's a little short on brain 
power." 
</P>
<P>
No Socialist -- and few conservatives -- would be caught making such 
disparaging remarks today about Doi, who led her party to a stunning victory 
against Japan's ruling Liberal Democrats in Sunday's election for the upper 
house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Created Political Machine 
</P>
<P>
Using the force of her offbeat personality and sharp wit, Doi, 60, has 
transformed the Socialist Party from an ossified collection of organized labor 
bosses and Marxist ideologues into a broad-based political machine that has 
tapped Japan's most undervalued human resource: women. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Doi positioned herself as the first opposition leader in 34 years 
to have a chance at becoming prime minister of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
That goal may prove ultimately elusive, but what is certain is that Doi has 
arrived as a significant political force. A few female politicians have held 
nominal Cabinet posts since Japan's women acquired the right to vote after 
World War II, but none has wielded genuine clout as Takako Doi has done. 
</P>
<P>
She took over as leader of the Socialists after their crushing defeat in the 
1986 double parliamentary election -- chosen by men as a feminist figurehead 
who might rejuvenate the party under what was cynically called the "madonna 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
But Doi surprised the pundits by acting aggressively to build party support 
through grass-roots organizations of women. The effort paid off with a series 
of recent election gains, culminating in Sunday's voting, which allowed the 
former university professor and constitutional lawyer to fully shed her image 
as a political lightweight and transcend her social status as a woman in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"She has become a powerful leader with the emergence of newly elected Socialist 
members of Parliament who are not union-based," said Takashi Inoguchi, a 
political science professor at Tokyo University. "A mass party is being born." 
</P>
<P>
Doi, a doctor's daughter from the port city of Kobe in western Japan, would 
seem an unlikely person to reshape the male-dominated political landscape in 
Japan. She never married and has been challenging the traditional constraints 
placed on women in Japanese society throughout her seven terms in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
As a young woman, Doi found her role model and decided on a career in law after 
seeing Henry Fonda in the film "Young Mr. Lincoln," she said in a speech before 
the Japan Society in New York in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I resolved to become 'Honest Abe,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the rare Japanese of the Christian faith, Doi graduated from Doshisha 
University, a prestigious Christian liberal arts college in Kyoto. She later 
taught courses there on Japan's postwar "peace constitution" -- the 
American-drafted document under which Japan renounces the right to wage war. 
</P>
<P>
"My love for the constitution is so intense," she told the Japan Society, "I 
remained wedded to it and have remained single." 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the Japan Socialist Party -- because it is dedicated to 
protecting the integrity of the constitution from revision by conservatives -- 
Doi has maintained an unorthodox, sometimes masculine image. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Obsessed With Pinball 
</P>
<P>
She has appeared regularly on television, matching wits with celebrities on 
quiz shows and throatily singing ballads on variety programs. Her favorite song 
is "My Way." 
</P>
<P>
Doi is a baseball fanatic, rooting for the Hanshin Tigers, and she confesses an 
obsession for pachinko, a noisy, low-brow pinball game usually associated with 
the working class and the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
Doi is also famous for her fiery attacks on mumbling prime ministers in 
Parliament, where she is a vociferous critic of military spending and 
U.S.-Japanese security ties. 
</P>
<P>
On the campaign trail, she wears pink suits and mesmerizes women supporters 
with her forceful demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of her campaign rhetoric suggests a revolutionary message that 
appears to be striking a sympathetic chord among Japanese housewives. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese women have persevered toward their fathers and their husbands, always 
walking several steps behind men," Doi said on the stump last week. "But the 
time for an end to perseverance has arrived." 
</P>
<P>
The comparison may seem forced, in view of their radically different outlook on 
the world, but Doi is said to share the qualities of toughness and resoluteness 
with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Socialist "Iron Lady" dubbed her voice in Japanese for that of 
Thatcher in a television drama about the hijacking of a North Sea oil rig that 
was aired on Japanese television three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
During the upper-house campaign, Doi skillfully dodged the issue of the 
Socialist Party's defense and security policies, saying the party would 
emphasize continuity rather that change if it took power in a coalition. But 
hemmed in by the party's left wing, which espouses unarmed neutrality, she has 
stopped short of making badly needed clarifications. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we have to look at reality," Doi said in an interview before making her 
first overseas trip as party leader two years ago, a highly symbolic visit to 
the United States. "Of course, we're against the U.S.-Japan security treaty, 
but that doesn't mean we can ignore the fact that the treaty is in effect." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decries Food Prices 
</P>
<P>
Doi has decried high food prices as burdensome to Japanese consumers, but in 
the campaign for the upper house she and her party attacked the liberalization 
of agricultural imports. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty of the Socialists' policy game plan has raised jitters in 
Washington and other foreign capitals at the prospect of Doi becoming prime 
minister. However, some political analysts note that whoever becomes prime 
minister would be captive to the onerous obligation of building national 
consensus before undertaking any change in course. 
</P>
<P>
Much as the Liberal Democrats have failed to carry out their goal of revising 
the constitution during 34 years in power, the Socialists might be forced to 
accept the status quo on defense, indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
In her speech before the Japan Society in 1987, Doi attempted to set the tone 
for a new dialogue between Washington and an increasingly pluralistic Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, many people equate socialism with communism, so that 
even our party's name creates some uneasiness in your country," she said. 
"Nevertheless, the U.S. government has found that it can deal constructively 
with a number of West European countries where socialist parties have come to 
power, even when it did not agree with some of their policies."

MOSBACHER DISREGARDED LAWYERS ALSO IN AIDING SHRIMPERS; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENTISTS IGNORED IN RULING ON TURTLES

<P>
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher ignored both his scientific experts and 
department lawyers when he allowed shrimpers in the Gulf of Mexico to discard 
devices designed to save sea turtles that are on the endangered species list, 
according to Commerce Department documents. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher acted Monday after a meeting with a number of Gulf Coast congressmen 
and after a weekend in which shrimpers blockaded shipping lanes in Houston and 
other coastal cities. The shrimpers were protesting the imminent imposition of 
federal regulations that would have required use of the devices in shrimp nets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acceded to Politicians 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher acceded to the demands of the politicians and shrimpers and ordered 
that so-called turtle excluder devices would not have to be used for at least 
the next three months, during the height of the shrimping season. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina is one of several states that have successfully used the 
excluder devices, commonly known as TEDs, designed to allow turtles to escape 
while keeping shrimp in the nets. During the first two weeks in July, turtle 
deaths off the Carolina coast were down dramatically. Only six dead sea turtles 
were documented, compared to an average of 56 during the same period over the 
last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Shrimpers along the Texas and Louisiana coasts contend that they will lose up 
to a third of their catches if the excluder devices are placed in the nets 
because the shrimp would escape with the turtles. 
</P>
<P>
The major species that the TED is designed to protect is the Kemp ridley sea 
turtle. One estimate is that there may be only 260 egg-laying females in the 
world, down from 40,000 a generation ago. When Mosbacher was asked Monday if 
political pressure had caused him to change his mind, he replied that he had 
altered the regulations because it was "the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. W. J. (Billy) Tauzin (D-La.), who convened the Monday meeting, said that 
most of the time was spent convincing the commerce secretary that he was 
empowered to change the regulations. "Mosbacher has that authority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An internal Commerce Department memo and a letter by Mosbacher himself showed 
that department scientists and lawyers were opposed to the change in the 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo from B. Kent Burton, an official of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, Mosbacher was told: "The only reasonable and 
prudent alternative which will allow shrimping to continue without jeopardizing 
the continued existence of identified sea turtle species is full implementation 
of the TED regulations." 
</P>
<P>
The memo was based on a "biological opinion" written by Terry Henwood of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service protected species branch. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally amazed" at Mosbacher's decision, Henwood said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On July 20, just four days before changing the regulations, Mosbacher wrote a 
letter to Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.), saying that "my legal counsel has 
advised me there is no basis in current law for modifications in the existing 
regulations." 
</P>
<P>
"This . . . is in turn compelled by the best scientific advice from NOAA that 
any significant modification of the TEDs regulations would jeopardize the 
continued existence of the Kemp ridley turtles as a species," Mosbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
The easing of the rules regarding the use of TEDs caused an immediate outcry in 
the environmental community. The National Wildlife Federation filed suit late 
Tuesday afternoon seeking a restraining order against Mosbacher's new stance. A 
hearing is set for Friday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, the wildlife federation said that the Commerce Department failed 
to consider the environmental impact of the postponement; didn't seek adequate 
public comment, violated the Endangered Species Act by placing the Kemp ridley 
turtle in jeopardy and violated the provision of the act that calls for changes 
only if they are for "good cause." 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Moyer, a legislative representative with the wildlife federation, said 
that Mosbacher's decision may "have helped fan the flames" in the volatile Gulf 
issue. Other environmental groups expressed similar misgivings, saying that, if 
the original regulations are restored, it could lead to violence if the Coast 
Guard attempts to cite shrimpers for non-compliance. 
</P>
<P>
"The news reports we've been getting (are) that the shrimpers are prepared to 
blockade again and use violence," said Michael Weber of the Center for 
Environmental Education. 
</P>
<P>
The prime mover in the fight against the use of TEDs is Louisiana shrimper Tee 
John Mialjavich, president of an organization called Concerned Shrimpers of 
America. Mialjavich said that, no matter what the outcome of the Washington 
court hearing, he and other shrimpers would not use TEDs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the villains, we're the victims," he said. He accused federal 
biologists of promoting TEDs even though their data was faulty.

MINORITIES OPPOSE LUCAS AS LACKING IN EXPERIENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The fight over the nomination of William Lucas to head the Justice Department's 
civil rights division sounds like a debate over affirmative action -- but with 
the roles reversed. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration and conservative Republican senators, usually foes of 
using race as a factor in employment decisions, say the fact that Lucas is 
black makes him a particularly good choice for the post. 
</P>
<P>
"The minorities ought to be thankful and grateful and appreciative that here, 
you've got one of your own members appointed," Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) 
said in leading the defense of the nomination last week before the Senate 
Judiciary Committee. In selecting Lucas to be the government's top civil rights 
lawyer, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh conceded that "there are probably better 
lawyers than Bill Lucas" but said Lucas' life stands as a "success story" of a 
black American. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Qualifications Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Washington's leading civil rights activists, who usually support 
race-based affirmative action, say that qualifications and legal experience, 
not race, are what count in selecting someone for this post. 
</P>
<P>
After seven recent civil rights setbacks in the Supreme Court, they say, it is 
more important than ever that the Justice Department have an experienced, 
aggressive advocate of civil rights. Instead, they contend, President Bush and 
Thornburgh have selected a novice -- who happens to be black. 
</P>
<P>
The clash illustrates the tough challenge the new civil rights battleground 
poses for the Administration. Eager to promote opportunity for minorities in 
its ranks -- a top priority of the Republican Party -- the White House finds 
itself hard-pressed to recruit highly qualified minority job candidates who 
both endorse its ideology and are acceptable to the civil rights establishment. 
</P>
<P>
With the Lucas nomination, the uneasy peace that prevailed between the 
Administration and key civil rights advocates has been shattered. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the closely divided Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on Lucas, a 
former sheriff, county executive and unsuccessful Republican candidate for 
governor of Michigan. If seven of the committee's eight Democrats vote "no" the 
nomination may be dead. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas did get a boost Wednesday when Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a 
wavering Republican, announced he would support the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, Bush and Thornburgh had sought to steer a comfortable middle 
course on civil rights. Where former President Ronald Reagan and his civil 
rights division chief, William Bradford Reynolds, were perceived as hostile to 
civil rights, Bush and Thornburgh tried to maintain a "cordial relationship" 
with civil rights leaders, as Justice Department spokesman David Runkel put it 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
But civil rights advocates say the record of the Bush Administration has not 
matched its public pronouncements. They note that Thornburgh found top-notch 
lawyers to head the divisions on antitrust, tax and environmental policy, but 
say that was not the case with civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
They also took note of Bush's reaction to the Supreme Court rulings. Where Bush 
proposed a constitutional amendment to overturn the protection of flag-burning 
as a form of political protest, the President and the attorney general had 
little to say about the civil rights decisions, other than that they would 
monitor their impact. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas did little to ease doubts about his legal acumen as he stumbled through a 
Judiciary Committee hearing last week. Asked to explain the difference between 
de jure and de facto segregation, Lucas appeared to draw a blank. 
</P>
<P>
A crucial distinction in school desegregation cases, de jure segregation is 
that established by law or official policy, while de facto segregation in 
schools may result from other causes such as housing patterns among blacks and 
whites. De jure segregation is illegal; de facto segregation is not. 
</P>
<P>
"I am new to the law," explained Lucas, a 1962 graduate of Fordham University 
Law School who has spent his career in law enforcement and government. 
</P>
<P>
An NAACP lawyer commented that for a civil rights lawyer not to know this 
distinction is akin to a doctor being unable to distinguish between an aorta 
and a vein. 
</P>
<P>
This was not Lucas' only problem before the committee. He commented that 
Congress was able to overturn the "Bob Jones decision" to grant tax exemptions 
to racially segregated colleges. In fact, there was nothing to correct, since 
the Supreme Court in an 8-to-1 vote rejected a Reagan Administration move to 
give out those tax exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing that he would support Lucas, Specter said it was unfair to give 
undue weight to legal knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Specter said Lucas' "tough experience as a member of a minority" is a more 
important qualification for the job of safeguarding minority rights than his 
"ability to articulate the refined nuances of Supreme Court decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Of further concern to skeptics at the hearings were episodes in Lucas' past 
involving gambling junkets to Las Vegas, hidden jewelry found during a customs 
search and misstatements on his bar application. 
</P>
<P>
For example, during a 1977 FBI investigation, Lucas, then the sheriff of Wayne 
County, Mich., admitted to having taken "three to five" trips to Las Vegas paid 
for by a Detroit man with ties to organized crime. Last week, Lucas told the 
senators he had taken only one such trip. Asked to explain why he gave the FBI 
a different story, he replied: "It was very casual. I felt no compunction to be 
precise." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Harlem and orphaned at an early age, Lucas got his start as a New York 
City policeman. He later became an FBI agent, a sheriff and Wayne County, 
Mich., executive. In 1985, he became a rising star of the Republican Party when 
he switched his allegiance from the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
His lengthy career in law enforcement and politics did not include actual legal 
work, his critics noted. Lucas has not tried a case, handled an appeal or 
written a legal brief. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas "does not meet any reasonable standard for confirmation" to the 
government's top legal post for civil rights enforcement, Ralph G. Neas, 
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, told the committee. The 
NAACP, its Legal Defense Fund and People for the American Way have also come 
out against the nomination.

BILL PROPOSED TO CURB MISSILE TECHNOLOGY SPREAD 
</P>

<P>
A bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers, moving to curb the spread of 
ballistic missile technology, on Wednesday introduced legislation that would 
call for sanctions against countries trying to buy such missile parts and 
companies willing to provide them. 
</P>
<P>
With U.S.-Soviet relations improving, "the greatest threat we face (may be) the 
proliferation of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons," said John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), a Senate backer of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would require the government to suspend doing business with domestic 
or foreign firms that sell assembled ballistic missiles or technical guidance 
on building them to developing countries. In addition, it would direct the 
President to impose a wide range of trade sanctions against nations trying to 
design and build such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation could lead to action against such countries as Argentina, 
Brazil, South Africa, Iran and India, all of which are believed to have 
substantial efforts under way to develop ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Through sanctions, the "chilling and horrifying prospect" of Third World 
regimes getting the means for a devastating attack against the United States 
could be lessened, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be significant support for such a measure in Congress, despite 
Bush Administration opposition. 
</P>
<P>
A similar amendment inserted into a House bill funding the defense budget was 
approved by the lopsided margin of 417 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
The move for a legislative push on the issue was announced by McCain, Sen. 
Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) and Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has opposed legislation that would limit U.S. flexibility in 
responding to the weapons transfer problem. 
</P>
<P>
Berman said some of the technology used on the Argentina-Iraq-Egypt Condor 
(missile) project was state-of-the-art U.S. Pershing (missile) technology -- 
transferred by scientists who worked on both projects. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable behavior," Berman said. "In their greed for profits, the 
European companies providing this equipment and technology are courting 
catastrophe."

COMPLAINING DOESN'T HELP DODGERS IN 6-2 LOSS 
</P>

<P>
As predictable as the game-time temperature in the Astrodome, three things 
happened when the Dodgers shared the floor with Houston pitcher Mike Scott 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Scott beat them. The Dodgers accused Scott of scuffing the baseball. Scott 
laughed. 
</P>
<P>
This time the score was 6-2, before a crowd of 33,563. This time Scott struck 
out a season-high 11 batters in eight innings, giving up four hits and one run. 
</P>
<P>
And this time, after Scott got his major league-leading 16th victory, the 
shouting was louder than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"If one team complained, it would be different, but everybody in the league 
complains about him scuffing the ball," Dodger shortstop Dave Anderson said. 
"If you are playing him, it's obvious what he does." 
</P>
<P>
Added Kal Daniels: "I'll tell you what, that ball sure does have a lot more 
movement than anybody I've ever faced. The umpires check it, but they don't see 
what we see. They don't see the marks." 
</P>
<P>
In the Astro clubhouse, Scott smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to check the ball, let them check the ball," he said. "They want to 
check me, let them check me. People have checked, and they've never found 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder, what do they say when they beat me? What do they say when they get a 
lot of hits off me? Do they accuse me of anything then?" 
</P>
<P>
That's a tough thing to ask the Dodgers because in 25 decisions against him in 
Scott's career, the Dodgers have only won nine. His career earned-run average 
against them is 2.53, better than against any other team. In this season alone, 
he has beaten them four times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," said Scott, still smiling, "it seems like the Dodgers complain more 
than anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Astro reliever Dave Smith, who finished the game, took the rebuttal a step 
further. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodgers definitely complain more than anybody, they and Montreal are 
probably the only two teams that even complain anymore," he said. "The clubs 
that do well against Mike, they never say anything. Don't you think that's 
funny? 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like the Dodgers come to the park gunned and ready to catch Mike 
Scott cheating." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that worrying about it works against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"The teams that do the best against Mike just try to hit the ball, not wonder 
about whether it will do something funny," Smith said. "And what gets me is, 
90% of the time the Dodgers check his split-finger pitches, not his fastball. 
Why in the heck would he scuff a split-finger pitch that he can throw like he 
does?" 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers admit, they like to collect Scott's pitches. They have even sent a 
boxful of allegedly scuffed baseballs to the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their grandchildren must be playing with them somewhere," Dodger 
Manager Tom Lasorda said when asked where the baseballs were. 
</P>
<P>
About the scuffing, Lasorda said: "I'm not saying that he does anything, I 
can't prove anything. All I can go by is what my players tell me. And my 
players say yes." 
</P>
<P>
After several of his players checked pitches Wednesday, Lasorda met with home 
plate umpire Bob Davidson to check on a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he couldn't see it," Lasorda said. "But what I've seen of the ball, 
it's difficult to see it, you have to feel it." 
</P>
<P>
Other Dodgers agreed that because of what they say are near invisible scuff 
marks, they will never be able to prove their charges against Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"As many times as people have checked him, and found nothing, it would be 
incredible to catch him now," Lenny Harris said. "But I saw something while I 
was standing on second base tonight that made me think. He was throwing balls 
to Billy Bean that, even if he swung, he couldn't get close to them. Pitches 
that were strikes! 
</P>
<P>
"His pitches do so many things, it's like a left-hander throwing them." 
</P>
<P>
Yet realizing the futility of their mission, some Dodgers insist on checking 
Scott anyway, for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Because checking on breaking pitches don't do any good, I'll ask them to check 
him a few times on pitches right down the middle," Kal Daniels said. "No way 
that ball would be scuffed but I figured, it might shake him up a little." 
</P>
<P>
And? 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't shake up very easy," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
In dropping his ERA to 2.44, Scott didn't allow a baserunner until Jeff 
Hamilton singled with two out in the fifth inning. Scott was so shook up by 
that single, he struck out the side in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
He did have trouble in the seventh, after Daniels and Franklin Stubbs singled. 
With two out, Hamilton sent a ball flying toward the left-field corner, but 
Mark Davidson make a leaping grab against the fence to turn a potential 
extra-base hit into an out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dodger starter and loser Fernando Valenzuela gave up nine hits and 
six runs, five of them earned, in 6 2/3 innings. After getting through a shaky 
first three innings, he couldn't survive a shaky Dodger defense in the fourth. 
He gave up three runs, all Houston needed. 
</P>
<P>
The inning wasn't quite what third baseman Hamilton needed. One out after Ken 
Caminiti led off with a double, Rafael Ramirez chopped a ball in front of third 
base while Caminiti was attempting to steal third. Hamilton, after retreating 
to the bag to cover the steal, couldn't react in time to get the grounder and 
throw Ramirez out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to run in two directions at once," Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have taken a quick reaction," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
After Davidson was walked, Scott grounded a ball under Hamilton's glove and 
into the left-field corner to score two runs. A third run scored two batters 
later on Craig Biggio's fly-ball out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing up a little bit in case Scott tried something funny," Hamilton 
said of the grounder. "Maybe if I was back, I would have had a better chance. 
It's just the way the year has gone." 
</P>
<P>
Or in the case of the Dodgers vs. Mike Scott, the years. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall missed a second consecutive start Wednesday with a sore back. 
After playing four games in three days on the hard turf in Pittsburgh, Marshall 
has not started in three of the Dodgers' last four games. He took extra batting 
practice with coach Ben Hines Wednesday, still trying to refine a swing that 
will spare his back unnecessary strain. "We're trying different things to 
protect the back," Hines said. . . . The X-rays taken of shortstop Alfredo 
Griffin's right thumb were negative, but Griffin did not play for a second 
consecutive night. "It would be different if the pain stays all the time, then 
I know how to deal with it, but this pain comes and goes," Griffin said. "And 
the thumb is not just hurting, but it is weak." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson left the team for his Detroit area home Wednesday and won't rejoin 
them until this weekend in San Diego. Gibson was placed on the disabled list 
Sunday with sore legs, and could be out for the rest of the season. . . . One 
day after being sent to the bullpen, pitcher Mike Morgan met with Manager Tom 
Lasorda Wednesday and discussed causes for Morgan's recent struggle. Morgan has 
already thrown more innings this season (127 2/3) than all of last season in 
Baltimore (88 1/3). After missing time in 1988 with a sore calf and a toe 
operation, Morgan followed intense weight training program throughout the 
winter before reporting to spring training. "I wonder if my body is paying the 
price for it now," said Morgan, who has lost three consecutive starts and has a 
10.50 ERA during that time. "I'm sure not going to do that weight program this 
off-season." 
</P>
<P>
In a somewhat surprising deal, the Dodgers have traded hard-hitting outfield 
prospect Javier Ortiz to the Houston organization for a player to be named. 
Ortiz, who has reported to Houston's triple-A team in Tucson, had 11 homers and 
36 RBIs for triple-A Albuquerque and was recently a member of the National 
League triple-A All-Star team.

JIM MURRAY: SAVING STEPS, HE'S TRYING TO MAKE LEAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonie Campbell is what the fight mob would call "strictly an opponent." 
</P>
<P>
He is the track-and-field equivalent of that pugilistic staple, the trial 
horse. He's good but not too. He's fast but not fastest. He's tough, skilled, 
he gets the most out of what he has. He's a survivor. 
</P>
<P>
If he were a baseball player, he'd bat second. In football, he'd catch 
everything thrown to him. There's a quality of undiscourageability to him. You 
get what you pay for from Tonie Campbell. He doesn't sulk, make excuses, 
complain. 
</P>
<P>
What he does is run an impeccable high-hurdles race every time he suits up. He 
chases people into world records. He makes every race an honest race. 
</P>
<P>
He's good. He has rarely been less than third-best in the world in his career. 
Other guys are faster. But nobody has better technique. Or more dedication. 
</P>
<P>
He has been on three Olympic teams. The first, 1980's, never went anywhere, 
thanks to the U.S. boycott. On the second, in Los Angeles, Campbell turned up 
with impacted wisdom teeth, four of them, and he wound up fifth. On the third, 
last fall in Seoul, he got the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
Tonie has, more or less, always been third banana. When he started hurdling, 
Renaldo (Skeets) Nehemiah was the wizard of the woods, running world records, 
culminating in a 12.93 for the 110-meter highs at Zurich in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
When Nehemiah quit to try pro football -- disastrously, it turned out -- with 
the San Francisco 49ers, Campbell had Greg Foster to chase. When he began to 
edge up on Foster, they both suddenly had Roger Kingdom to worry about. Kingdom 
shocked the track world by winning the gold at Los Angeles in 1984 and then won 
again at Seoul with the first sub-13-second race in Olympic history, 12.96. 
</P>
<P>
So, Tonie Campbell, probably the most consistent and durable hurdler ever, and 
probably no worse than the fourth- or fifth-best who ever ran the race, is as 
overlooked as the guy who played third base in the Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance 
infield, or Mike Tyson's sparring partner. 
</P>
<P>
To give you an idea, when Campbell won the world indoor championship in 
Indianapolis in 1987 in a 60-meter race in which Greg Foster and the Canadian, 
Mark McKoy, collided and fell, the first TV questions he got were: "Did you get 
a look at Greg Foster's fall? Do you think you could have won without that?" 
</P>
<P>
Recalls Campbell: "They thought I should have felt guilty for winning. But I 
ran 7.51 and the world record was 7.46." 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor high-hurdling is a 10-jump event that is less a race than a gantlet. 
Speed is not exactly incidental but it's not paramount. Campbell initially 
wanted no part of hurdling. 
</P>
<P>
"I regarded it as a punishment, not a competition," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't quite fast enough, though, to keep up with world-class sprinters. So 
he reluctantly agreed to try timber-topping. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I went over, I thought, 'Wow! This is like flying!' It was the 
greatest feeling in the world, those 8/10ths of a second over the board. It was 
love at first flight." 
</P>
<P>
As a guy who likes to spend his weekends sky-diving or skin-diving, Campbell 
gets restless at sea level anyway. At first, the hurdling came easily. 
Discipline was something else. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was a rebel, but I was a jerk," Tonie admits. "I had no direction. 
And when kids have no direction, they really find a way to get lost." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell almost ended up running the streets instead of the hurdles. USC 
provided his turning point, when it threatened to rescind his track 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"The university threatened to remove it unless I changed three things: 1. my 
attitude; 2. my grades; 3. my relationship with my family," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The usual procedure in a confrontation of this kind is for "friends" to rally 
around the athlete and say, "They can't do this to you. Get a lawyer!" 
</P>
<P>
But Campbell is glad he didn't. He shaped up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad they did it," he says today. "It brought me up short. It changed my 
life. I grew up, traveled all over the world, met different people, saw 
different cultures. If I had dropped out then, I'd probably never have gotten 
out of Carson and would be living a hard life now." 
</P>
<P>
He assesses his chances analytically: 
</P>
<P>
"There are three disciplines to hurdling -- speed, power and technique. I set 
out to be as technically perfect as I could be. It was my edge." 
</P>
<P>
To this day, he can stand in front of a mirror and spot any telltale 
three-pound bulge in his silhouette. If he does, he hits the salad bar till it 
comes off. Guys who are strictly opponents can't make even small mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
But neither do they always remain strictly opponents. Just ask James J. 
Braddock, Jersey Joe Walcott, Rocky Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 6, in the Jack In The Box Invitational meet at UCLA's Drake Stadium, 
Campbell will be coming to turn Kingdom and Foster into opponents. Tonie, 
pencil-slim, bespectacled, cannot hope to out-power them but he is working on a 
new two-step interval, instead of the traditional three, between hurdles. He 
wants to spend as little time as possible on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
What he'd really like to do is win so often -- right up to and in Barcelona in 
1992 -- that when he does mishap, the TV will come up to Kingdom and Foster and 
say, "Did either of you guys see what in the world happened to Tonie Campbell?"

ROBINSON AGREES TO A TWO-YEAR PACT WITH KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last summer, owner Bruce McNall of the Kings committed millions of dollars to 
get Wayne Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers. Now he has come up with another 
million or so to get defenseman Larry Robinson from the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
How long can this go on? 
</P>
<P>
"Until we stop owning the team or drop dead or go broke doing it," McNall said 
Wednesday at the Forum in announcing that the Canadiens had not matched the 
Kings' offer for the services of Robinson, a free agent since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've made it fairly obvious that our desire is to bring a Stanley Cup 
to Los Angeles as soon as possible. Larry Robinson will help us do that," 
McNall said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson accepted a contract from the Kings to play for two years, with an 
option year, for a reported $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
It was not easy for Robinson, 38, to leave the Canadiens, a team he has played 
for all 17 years of his National Hockey League career. Robinson won two Norris 
Trophies as the league's best defenseman, and played on six Stanley Cup 
championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big step for me," Robinson said. "I know I'm not a young puppy 
anymore, but I hope I can help them win a championship here." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson asked to clarify reports that during contract negotiations, Canadien 
General Manager Serge Savard refused to assure him that his No. 19 would be 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
"Donny (Cape, Robinson's agent) asked Serge if they were thinking of doing it, 
and Serge said he couldn't give him an answer," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I never made any demands. I don't think it's something that you demand. 
It's an honor that comes to you." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Fox of the Kings thinks that is an honor that is sure to come to Robinson. 
So when Fox -- who has worn No. 19 for the Kings since he joined the club in 
1980 -- heard that the deal was official, he immediately offered Robinson his 
number. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody asked me," Fox said. "I just said right away that he has to have No. 
19. He's going to be a Hall of Famer five years from now. I didn't even have to 
think about it. I just did it out of respect for him." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he appreciated Fox's offer. He had told the Kings he would wear 
any number available. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Kings who showed up at the Forum to welcome the new teammate was Ron 
Duguay. He said that he came "out of respect for the man," adding: "We're just 
that much closer to the Stanley Cup. . . . We're bringing in winners." 
</P>
<P>
Said McNall: "A few years ago, people thought that being sent to Los Angeles 
was like being exiled. Hopefully, with Wayne's presence here, we're changing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that the idea of playing with Gretzky was "a joy." As a 
defensemen, he has had more than enough of playing against Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne has shown what he can bring to a club," Robinson said. "The Kings moved 
up from pretty low (18th overall) to fourth last year. Hopefully, we'll up that 
a little." 
</P>
<P>
As for his age, Robinson said: "Everybody says I've been a teacher my whole 
career. I don't know about that. But I do think that the best teaching is to 
lead by example. . . 
</P>
<P>
"They've been telling me I've been over the hill for the last five or six 
years. Yet when they need someone in a big situation, they call on me. I've 
always tried to look after myself. I have taken care of myself. I can't do what 
I did at 24 or 25, but, then, I wasn't the greatest at 24 or 25." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's career took off right after that, however. He was a first-team 
all-star in 1977, 1979 and 1980, a second-team all-star in 1978, 1981 and 1986. 
And he has played in the All-Star game nine times. 
</P>
<P>
He won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings figure he has a few good years left, even though he scored his first 
NHL goal against Rogie Vachon, now the Kings' general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Vachon, who was out of town Wednesday, has said that Robinson will add 
"stability, character and leadership" and bring the Kings a "giant step closer 
to a Stanley Cup championship." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he thought the Kings need most, Robinson answered: "Ice." 
</P>
<P>
The Forum was set up for TeamTennis and that's not something he found at the 
Forum in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
But he had earlier said that one thing he liked about Los Angeles was that 
there is a hockey off-season. In Montreal, there is no down time, as he put it. 
</P>
<P>
As for what it will be like for him to go back to the Forum in Montreal and 
play against the Canadiens, Robinson said: "Thank goodness we don't have to go 
there until the 11th of December." 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings' training camp this year is at Hull, Quebec, a short drive from 
Montreal. And Robinson will be reporting there Sept. 7.

CHEMISTS, COACHES STRESS TESTING IN HIGH SCHOOLS

<P>
A coaches' association, in conjunction with the American Assn. for Clinical 
Chemistry, Wednesday announced plans to send each U.S. high school a primer on 
steroids, stressing testing as the best method to stop abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The "High School Coaches' Guide to Steroid Use and Detection" will be sent to 
about 19,000 U.S. high schools before the football season starts, said Skip 
Morris, executive director of the National High School Athletic Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The guide, produced by the chemists' association, claims steroid use is growing 
to epidemic proportions among high school athletes and that the only sure-fire 
method of detection is from a urinalysis. 
</P>
<P>
Anabolic steroids, a derivative of the male hormone testosterone, can enhance 
muscle development and performance, but doctors claim the drugs have harmful 
side effects, particularly for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools are beginning to look at testing programs as a tool to rid their 
schools of these dangerous drugs," Morris said. "A complete program of 
education and testing can move us forward." 
</P>
<P>
Because the cost of a steroid test is approaching $200, Morris said most 
schools would choose random testing. He dismissed possible civil rights and 
privacy objections, saying many young athletes have asked for testing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said high school athletes already conform to certain requirements, such 
as maintaining their grades, and suggested that drug testing could be an 
additional requirement to play.

NEWSWIRE: LEONARD-DURAN WILL BE FOR AT LEAST ONE WBC TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran announced plans Wednesday to fight for at 
least one, and possibly two, World Boxing Council titles. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Trainer, Leonard's attorney, whose Victory Promotions will co-promote the 
bout with Bob Arum's Top Rank Inc., said in New York that if the fight is held 
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, it will be Nov. 2; if it is bought by Donald 
Trump's Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, N.J., it will be held Nov. 30, and should 
it be held at Steve Wynn's new Mirage at Las Vegas, it would be in the first 
week of December. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer wouldn't say what the boxers would earn, but did say that Leonard would 
get both a guarantee and a percentage, and that most of Duran's money would 
come from his guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer added that the fight could be for both the WBC middleweight and 
super-middleweight titles but that, for now, it will be only for Leonard's

Kevin Singleton, a University of Arizona linebacker being treated for leukemia, 
was released Wednesday from University Medical Center. His doctor said 
Singleton was headed toward remission. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, who expressed his thanks for widespread support, said his acute 
lymphblastic leukemia is "a challenge for me. I handle challenges. I live to 
destroy, to dominate challenges." 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, 22, a fifth-year senior, was admitted July 7 with a bacterial 
shoulder infection and other symptoms later diagnosed as leukemia. He lost 30 
of his 230 pounds but has regained four to five pounds in the past few days, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert M. Rifkin said the infection has cleared up completely, but added 
that Singleton has not received chemotherapy treatment long enough to be in 
formal remission. 
</P>
<P>
Said Singleton: "The people of Arizona have shown me that they really care for 
Kevin Singleton as a person, as an athlete," and that 20 to 30 letters daily 
and a barrage of flowers and balloons had helped his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton was an honorable mention Pacific 10 Conference selection at inside 
linebacker.

EUROPE WILL PLACE A QUOTA ON U.S. TV SHOWS, MAXWELL TELLS CONGRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
British movie mogul Robert Maxwell, rebuffing U.S. calls for unrestricted sales 
of American television shows to Europe, told a House panel Wednesday that there 
will eventually be a quota on Hollywood's productions and that the industry 
must come to terms with the inevitable instead of engaging in a bruising trade 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, chairman of Maxwell Communications, called U.S. threats of trade 
retaliation over television and movies "hollow" and said: "Europe will have a 
directive (quota). You can have a hard directive or a soft directive. . . . You 
need the competition. You've conquered the world, now it's our turn. You cannot 
drive us into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
The declaration followed a rousing free-trade speech by Jack Valenti, president 
of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, and warnings from U.S. officials who 
said any quota would violate international trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want any more than the same freedom of access that European 
businessmen find (in the United States). Nothing more, nothing less," Valenti 
said. "They don't need any quota crutch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seeking to Preserve Heritage' 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, before the House Commerce Committee's subcommittee on 
telecommunications, was an attempt to find common ground between the European 
Community and Hollywood but only seemed to underscore their philosophical 
chasm. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans, in drafting rules for their 1992 economic union, say they are 
just seeking to preserve their cultural heritage and fledgling movie industry 
in the face of overwhelming competition from the United States. But Hollywood 
charges that "Europe without walls" is only a veil for a "Europe without 
American television," and that the proposed quota could be a prelude to 
escalating protectionism. 
</P>
<P>
A law to ensure that more than 50% of air time is filled by shows produced by 
the 12 EC nations is at the center of the dispute. According to EC figures, 
only about 5,000 hours of Europe's annual 105,000 hours of TV and movies are 
produced on the Continent, the majority being American-made, earning Hollywood 
$800 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move Could Backfire 
</P>
<P>
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Julius Katz agreed, saying the idea of a quota 
is not acceptable and would violate international trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
But Maxwell warned that U.S. efforts to stave off any limits might succeed in 
blocking a uniform European policy but could backfire by leaving individual 
nations free to pass more rigorous limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"The American entertainment industry stands to lose a greater portion of the 
European broadcast market if the Council of Ministers cannot reach an agreement 
and the decision is relegated to the judgments and controls of the European 
states," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said countries such as France, which is pushing the hardest for greater 
European restrictions, is the "greater menace." Working together, the United 
States and the EC could both profit by maximizing a potential market of 335 
million viewers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can do for software and television what NATO did for European defense," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
David Webster, a former director of the BBC, said the directive would be a 
"minimum regulatory framework" and the "best deal available" to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"America is going to make much more money in the expanding market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the testimony was lively and often in direct contradiction, the tone 
remained amiable and both sides stressed that talks should prevail over 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"We can avert all that," Valenti said. "Each side knows that the stakes are too 
high to be unreasonable."

SHUWA RULING POSES CHALLENGE TO WAY BUSINESS IS DONE IN JAPAN 
</P>

<P>
A Japanese real estate giant with substantial holdings in the United States has 
rattled the corporate establishment at home, challenging an entrenched system 
of crossed share holdings in a hostile takeover bid that may help open Japan's 
financial markets to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
Shuwa Corp., which owns Arco Plaza in Los Angeles and more than 30 other 
buildings in the United States, has caused a minor sensation here by 
accumulating large stakes in two regional supermarket chains and talking boldly 
about combining their operations into one large and efficient retailing concern 
-- against the wishes of the companies' managers. 
</P>
<P>
Such a gambit might seem commonplace in the United States, but in Japan most 
companies guard against hostile takeovers by placing blocks of stock in the 
hands of friendly, "stable" investors. The game of mergers and acquisitions is 
usually played in the shadows by unsavory characters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shareholders as Owners 
</P>
<P>
When takeover activity does come out into the open, it invariably involves some 
form of "greenmail" -- the practice in which a takeover target pays a potential 
acquirer, usually by buying back acquired shares at a premium, in return for 
the other's promise not to pursue the takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
Shuwa's high-profile bid for controlling interests in Chujitsuya Co. and 
Inageya Co. was given a boost Tuesday by the Tokyo District Court, which 
prohibited the two retailers from swapping new issues of heavily discounted 
stock in a takeover defense intended to dilute Shuwa's holdings. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what kind of legal precedent the ruling would set, 
or whether it might contribute to Japan's industrial restructuring and help 
reform the rigid and exclusive web of corporate cross-holdings, a system that 
has its origins in the pre-World War II zaibatsu conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
But by ruling that the companies should have obtained approval at general 
shareholder meetings before planning the stock swap, the court backed Shuwa's 
contention that shareholders are the ultimate owners of publicly held 
companies. Traditionally, ordinary shareholders wield little or no influence 
over management activities in Japan's corporate culture. 
</P>
<P>
T. Boone Pickens Jr., an American corporate raider, said the court's decision 
"represents a strong step toward breaking down the anti-investment barriers 
erected by Japan's cartels." 
</P>
<P>
Pickens is battling for representation on the board of a Tokyo company -- which 
makes automobile headlights and other parts -- in which he purchased a 20% 
stake earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the Japanese courts are now deciding that Japan Inc. cannot ignore the 
rights of its shareholders," Pickens said in a statement issued at the 
Amarillo, Tex., office of his Boone Co. investment partnership. "This ruling is 
an important step in our efforts to remove barriers and open up Japan to 
shareholder rights and foreign investment." 
</P>
<P>
Kanji Ishizumi, a Tokyo lawyer specializing in mergers and acquisitions, said 
the judgment "backs up what Mr. Pickens has been saying" about shareholder 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"Things will definitely change from now; they have to," Ishizumi said. 
"Japanese can buy U.S. companies freely, but the reverse isn't true because 
cross-holdings among friendly shareholders in Japan make it impossible to 
acquire a majority." 
</P>
<P>
Shigeru Kobayashi, Shuwa's president, assembled holdings of 33% and 21%, 
respectively, in Chujitsuya and Inageya, buying shares on the open market over 
a two-year period to become the top shareholder in each of the family 
controlled companies. He also obtained stock in three other retailers, 
including one run by an old friend with whom he planned to cooperate in merging 
and operating the business once the acquisitions were complete. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Streamlining the System 
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi, whose aggressive real estate acquisitions in the United States 
coincided with rising uneasiness over Japanese "investment friction," then 
adopted a cause seemingly designed to generate good will. He said he wanted to 
do his part to streamline the complicated and inefficient distribution system, 
which has been widely blamed in recent years for restricting imports. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to restructure the general merchandise distribution industry," 
Kobayashi said. "People will see that what we are doing is right, after seeing 
the results." 
</P>
<P>
On the advice of Nomura Wasserstein Perella Co., a Tokyo-based joint venture 
between Japan's largest brokerage and a New York investment bank, Chujitsuya 
and Inageya announced July 10 a plan to expand their cross-holdings to 19.5% by 
trading issues of new stock, discounted by as much as 78% below market prices. 
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi sued for a court injunction against the offering, and this led to 
Tuesday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The two supermarket chains "won't fight beyond this" for the stock swap, said 
Mitsuo Goto, president of Nomura Wasserstein. "But they will pursue business 
ties between the two companies and oppose any outside interference in the 
management." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kobayashi has hinted at the possibility of selling off his shares to 
major national retail chains, such as Seibu/Saison Group or Daiei Inc., his 
strategy from now on is not clear, nor is it certain that he can continue to 
buy shares on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of who is the winner or loser, I think that the Shuwa case will be 
a positive factor in vitalizing the Japanese securities market," Rinichi 
Kanzaki, an investment consultant, said in a television interview. "Japanese 
companies cannot live in an environment of peace and quiet forever." 
</P>

Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber: The Akron, Ohio, tire manufacturer said 
second-quarter profit fell 44% to $118.2 million, largely due to a pretax loss 
of $43 million on the sale of its South African subsidiary. Sales totaled $2.8 
billion, about the same as a year ago.

Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber of Akron, Ohio, reported a second-quarter profit of 
$27.1 million, compared to a $134.9-million profit in the same period a year 
ago. The company said its profit was affected by the sale of its South African 
subsidiary, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $52 million. Proceeds from 
this sale are expected to total $41 million when the sale is completed in the 
third quarter.

AT&amp;T Seeks Rate Cuts: Citing competitive pressures, AT&amp;T has asked the 
California Public Utilities Commission to approve a 19% cut, effective Sept. 1, 
for WATS -- wide area telecommunications service -- within California. That 
would allow heavy users of long-distance service within California to save more 
on outgoing calls -- paying $147 for 15 hours of full-state service a month 
instead of $174.50. (Under PUC rules, AT&amp;T can raise or lower prices up to 
15% without prior approval by the commission.) AT&amp;T also will cut rates on 
its toll-free 800-prefix service Sept. 1 for incoming calls within the state by 
an average of 9%, saving customers about $197.50 for 15 hours of service a 
month.

Rising interest costs cut second-quarter earnings at General Motors Corp.'s 
financing subsidiary, while the auto maker's two other major subsidiaries 
reported increases for the period, the companies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of communications satellite services pushed earnings to new highs at GM 
Hughes Electronics Corp. Demand for data-processing services by banks and other 
customers boosted results at Electronic Data Systems Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The parent company's earnings report was expected today. 
</P>
<P>
The finance subsidiary, General Motors Acceptance Corp., said net income from 
its financing, insurance and mortgage operations was $268.6 million for the 
three months ended June 30, nearly a 20% drop from $333.9 million in the second 
quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
GMAC said its financing and leasing business in the United States increased 27% 
in volume from the earlier period, but interest costs soared. The company said 
its average cost of borrowings worldwide was 9.53% for the quarter, up from 
7.94% a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
GMAC had total assets of $102.8 billion June 30, up from $99.9 billion a year 
earlier, spokesman John Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
GM Hughes Electronics said its telecommunications growth included sales of 
satellite services to three operations: a joint venture of HBO and Turner 
Broadcasting System; ESPN, the nation's largest cable network, and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes also said continuing cost-reduction efforts at Hughes Aircraft Co. and 
Delco Electronics contributed to the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported second-quarter earnings of $240 million, up from $180 
million in the second quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The second-quarter earnings a year earlier were boosted by one-time gains from 
stock sales. Earnings from operations comparable to 1989 would have been $180 
million, spokesman Bruce McCristal said. 
</P>
<P>
EDS said profit was $104.9 million on revenue of $1.38 billion, up from $95.7 
million on revenue of $1.20 billion a year ago.

</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Texaco Inc. reported a 21% drop in its second-quarter earnings Wednesday due 
partly to lower production and refinery slowdowns, while Shell Oil Co. and 
Occidental Petroleum Corp. said their profits rose during the period. 
</P>
<P>
Higher crude oil prices benefited all three firms as did a steep rise in 
gasoline and other oil product sales prices. But the gains were partially 
offset by dwindling production. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco's profit fell to $366 million, from $464 million compared to 1988 
results. The second-quarter 1988 results included a restructuring gain of $225 
million from the sale of its West German unit. Revenue declined 10% to $8.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Higher crude prices benefited Texaco's exploration and production business, 
while a steep rise in gas prices in the quarter helped refining and marketing 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But those gains were offset partly by declines in foreign exploration and 
production earnings stemming from last year's platform explosion in the North 
Sea and the sale of Texaco subsidiaries in Canada and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco also said its refining margins were reduced by a softening of gasoline 
prices toward the close of the quarter and scheduled maintenance at three 
refineries. 
</P>
<P>
White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco is the nation's third-largest oil concern 
behind Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum's earnings rose about 4% from last year 
to $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
It said quarterly earnings reflected extraordinary losses of $4 million in 1989 
and $10 million in 1988 from the early payment of debt. Revenue rose 7% to $5.1 
billion from the 1988 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's Piper Alpha oil platform off Aberdeen, Scotland, exploded and 
burned July 6, 1988, in the North Sea's worst oil disaster. Texaco and 
Occidental were two of four companies operating the field, where production has 
been delayed since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental said the North Sea accident reduced its exploration and production 
earnings, but that was partially offset by higher crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental said coal division earnings tumbled to $1 million from $3 million 
due to strikes by miners in Kentucky and Tennessee , who joined a wildcat 
strike in sympathy with a walkout against Pittston Coal Group's operations in 
Virginia and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Houston-based Shell, the nation's sixth-largest oil company, said 
second-quarter earnings soared 61% from a year ago to $440 million. Revenue 
totaled $5.9 billion, a 9% gain. The company is a unit of Royal Dutch Shell.

STUDY: WORKING MOTHERS PAY $14 BILLION FOR CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Working mothers spent $14 billion in 1986 on care for children younger than 15, 
with poor women paying disproportionately high percentages of their family 
income, the U.S. Census Bureau reported. 
</P>
<P>
In the most detailed survey of working women's child-care arrangements yet 
conducted, the bureau spotlighted disparities that are fueling a drive on 
Capitol Hill toward some kind of child-care help for poor families. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the 18.2 million working mothers with children under 15 made 
cash payments for child care, paying on average $45 a week, or 6% of their 
monthly family income, the survey found. But women in poverty who paid for 
child care devoted 22% of their income -- about $32 a week -- to it. 
</P>
<P>
More than 29 million children -- 9 million of them younger than age five -- had 
mothers who worked full or part time in 1986, said Martin O'Connell, chief of 
the Census Bureau's fertility statistics branch. There are now 52 million 
children under age 15 in the U.S. population, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A $750 Tax Credit 
</P>
<P>
While both parties support helping financially struggling families pay for 
child care, two competing Senate bills use different methods for reaching the 
same goal, and the debate has split largely along partisan lines. 
</P>
<P>
Most Senate Democrats and a few Republicans support the $1.75-billion "Act for 
Better Child Care," known as ABC. Along with tax credits and refunds, the ABC 
would subsidize low-income parents with children in day care and set up 
programs to improve the quality and availability of child-care services. 
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans support a plan that gives up to a $750 tax credit to families 
with small children, whether or not the mothers work, and provides $400 million 
a year for block grants to help states expand and improve services. 
</P>
<P>
ABC supporters said the Census Bureau survey illustrated why the government 
must channel more money toward day care. While the poorest women in the survey 
paid $32 a week, the wealthiest families, with income of more than $3,750 a 
month -- paid $58 a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be concerned about what (the women in poverty) are buying," said Helen 
Blank, director of child care for the Children's Defense Fund. "Poor people are 
stretching all they can. I don't think poor people prefer the cheapest day 
care." 
</P>
<P>
But William Maddox, director of policy analysis for the Family Research Center, 
said the survey is misleading because it focuses solely on working mothers. 
When both working and non-working mothers are considered, he said, "Less than 
one child in five is in a paid care situation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TV as Babysitter 
</P>
<P>
Maddox also said the poorest families may pay less because they rely on 
church-subsidized day care or pay for fewer hours. The survey found that only 
21% of poor mothers paid for child-care services of any kind. The center 
supports tax credits for poor families with children regardless of whether the 
mother works. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a weighted statistical survey of 1,650 working mothers conducted 
nationwide between September and November, 1986, the survey also found that 28% 
of children under five whose mothers work are cared for in their own home, 
while 42% are cared for in someone else's home and 21% are in formal day-care 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), who introduced the ABC bill, said these 
statistics underscored the need for the ABC. "If you're putting (children) in 
someone else's home, often you're putting them in front of a television set. 
You're not putting them in the kind of environment you'd like." 
</P>
<P>
The survey also identified important seasonal differences in the way mothers 
care for children aged five to 14. During the school year, 70% of these 
children were in school while their mothers worked, and 5% cared for 
themselves, the survey found. But in the summer, 13.2% of the five to 14 year 
olds -- or an extra 1.6 million children -- were on their own.

Eastern Backs Off: Eastern Airlines withdrew a request to abrogate its pilots 
contract with the striking Air Line Pilots Assn. The company said the filing to 
abrogate the contract "may be an impediment to resolving the (contract) 
dispute" and that it therefore decided to withdraw the motion. The pilot union 
hailed the withdrawal of Eastern's motion as a victory.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: CHECK WRITING FOR EVERY PC USER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence J. Magid, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I hate to pay bills. It's not just that I don't like to part with my money; I 
also detest the process of writing checks, recording the transaction in my 
check register and making sure that the check gets into the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, that's no longer necessary. For some time, several banks have 
offered home banking services that make it possible for PC users to sign on to 
the bank's computer and pay bills, check on balances, transfer funds between 
accounts and, in some cases, review statements and transactions. 
</P>
<P>
And now, even if your bank doesn't offer such a service, it's possible to enjoy 
the convenience of electronic bill paying. Checkfree Technologies of 
Westervile, Ohio, offers a service called CheckFree that lets you pay your 
bills from your PC without writing a check. You can draw funds from any 
financial institution that issues checks, including banks, savings and loans, 
credit unions and brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
The service requires an IBM or compatible personal computer and a modem to 
connect your machine to a telephone line. It comes with its own software. A 
version that will work with the Apple Macintosh is scheduled to come out later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Before you can use the service, you must send the company a voided check. You 
also fill out a membership form and agree to allow CheckFree to debit your 
checking account for any transactions you order. 
</P>
<P>
Using the software is easy. When you first use the program you fill out a form 
on the screen with your name, address, phone number, social security number, 
name of your bank and your four-digit CheckFree account number. Then you 
provide CheckFree with information about any individual or business -- all 
referred to as "merchants" -- that you wish to pay. Additional merchants can be 
added at any time. 
</P>
<P>
This is a lot more convenient than some banks' home banking services, which 
allow you to pay only vendors who are registered with the bank to accept such 
payments. Bank of America's HomeBanking service, for example, issues a 
directory with the names of 15,000 payees, including many large and small 
businesses but not necessarily those that you want to pay. 
</P>
<P>
I tested the CheckFree service by adding myself as a merchant and sending 
myself a check. I also used it to pay some bills. The service requires three 
business days from the time you order the check until it is guaranteed to 
arrive. My check arrived a day early, and all the other bills were paid on 
time. 
</P>
<P>
When you're ready to pay a bill, you use the arrow key on the computer keyboard 
to highlight the name of a payee from the list of merchants that you have 
entered. The screen then displays the image of a check, made out to the payee 
and dated three business days from the current date. (You can enter a later 
date if you prefer.) You enter the amount and a one-line "memo" that will 
appear on a statement sent with the check. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've finished "writing" all your checks, you tell the software to send 
your transactions to CheckFree's processing center. The software instructs the 
modem to dial the phone and send the information. A record of that payment is 
saved in a check register that can be printed or displayed. The software does 
not perform any home or business accounting tasks, but users of two of the 
leading home accounting programs, Quicken (reviewed in last week's Computer 
File column) and Managing Your Money, can import data directly from CheckFree. 
</P>
<P>
The company uses three methods to issue payments. Some payments are made by 
electronic funds transfer through the Federal Reserve System. That requires the 
payee to be registered to receive such funds. In the case of individuals or 
businesses that are not registered, CheckFree issues a paper check. 
</P>
<P>
CheckFree debits your account on the day that the merchant is scheduled to 
receive your check, regardless of when you processed the payment. With some 
home banking services, including those from Bank of America and CitiBank, the 
bank debits your account up to five days before the payee actually receives 
your funds. Until then, the bank gets free use of your money. 
</P>
<P>
Subscribers to CheckFree generally don't get back their canceled checks. They 
do, however, get a notation on their bank statement. Such notations, according 
to CheckFree literature, are all the legal evidence you need for tax or other 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
For me, CheckFree simplifies the entire bill-paying process. Not only do I 
avoid paper work, but I can pay my bills at my convenience, as long as I 
process the order three or more days before the payment is due. 
</P>
<P>
The service can eliminate the game of Russian roulette that some people play 
with their bills. They want to pay their bills on time but don't want to send 
their money too early. So they wait until a couple of days before the payment 
is due. If they slip up, however, they risk being late. That can result in 
extra charges and, if it happens too often, a bad credit rating. With 
CheckFree, you can pay your bills up to a year in advance but hold onto the 
money until the bill actually is due. You also can order the service to make 
recurring payments for such regular bills as mortgages, car loans or insurance 
premiums. 
</P>
<P>
When you take into account the money you save on postage and check-printing 
costs, the price of CheckFree service is reasonable. There is a one-time $49 
fee for a start-up kit that includes the software, a manual and the first 
month's usage. The service costs $9 per month for up to 20 payments. Additional 
payments cost $3 for up to 10 transactions. There are additional charges for 
stop payment orders, returns for insufficient funds or printed statements. 
CheckFree is at 720 Greencrest Drive, Westervile, OH 43081. Phone: (614) 
898-6011 or (800) 848-6070.

PEOPLE: AUGER WILL BECOME DAILY NEWS PUBLISHER

<TEXT>
<P>
David J. Auger, a cable-television marketing executive, has been named 
publisher of the Daily News newspaper in Woodland Hills, effective Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Auger, 33, succeeds Robert Steven Morris, who after two years on the job 
resigned in June to pursue other interests. The Daily News is owned by 
Washington businessman Jack Kent Cooke, whose holdings also include the 
Washington Redskins football team and the Chrysler building in New York. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Auger had been vice president of marketing for Cooke 
CableVision Inc., another of Cooke's media interests, which are based in 
Woodland Hills. Previously, he also was a marketing executive with Warner 
Communications' cable division. 
</P>
<P>
In the six months ended March 31, the Daily News had a daily circulation of 
about 183,000 and a Sunday circulation of about 201,500, according to figures 
reported to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, a newspaper auditing concern. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Cooke announced plans to sell his extensive cable-TV 
holdings for $1.6 billion to a consortium of cable operators. Overall, the 
systems serve about 660,000 subscribers in 20 states. JAMES F. PELTZ

PEOPLE: EX-PRESIDENT TO RETURN

<TEXT>
<P>
Just a week after it dismissed Chief Executive H. David Bright, National 
Education Corp. has announced that former President Jerome W. Cwiertnia is 
returning to his old job and assuming the position of chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
NEC Chairman David C. Jones named Cwiertnia, 48, acting president and chief 
operating officer and indicated the appointments will become permanent at the 
company's next board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
National Education in Irvine is the nation's largest vocational training 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"I take this as a pleasant surprise," said Arthur Rade, analyst with the New 
York brokerage of Merrill Lynch. "Cwiertnia is highly thought of both 
internally and in the investment community." 
</P>
<P>
Cwiertnia's appointment was seen by some analysts as another rebuke of Bright's 
reign by National Education's board. When he resigned last March, Cwiertnia 
said it was because he wanted a position that would give him more 
responsibility while analysts said the real reason was that he and Bright often 
clashed. 
</P>
<P>
Following his resignation as president, Cwiertnia continued to serve as a 
consultant. He earned $685,400 in 1988, according to public records. GREGORY

DISNEY STOCK UP AS TAKEOVER RUMORS SPREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walt Disney Co. stock rose sharply Wednesday amid speculation that the 
entertainment kingdom might be the next takeover target of Paramount 
Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank-based Disney would not comment other than to say it had no information 
to explain the rise. 
</P>
<P>
The stock, up more than $7 at one point from Tuesday's close, finished up 
$5.375 at $109.75 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
A group led by Sid Bass, one of the Ft. Worth family of investors, owns about 
16% of Disney's shares, but that holding has been described as long term and 
amicable. There was no comment from the Bass group Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bass family in 1984 spent $333 million and took a 25% share of Disney's 
stock to help the company ward off hostile takeover attempts by financiers Saul 
Steinberg of New York and Irwin A. Jacobs of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
However, there has been market speculation that the Bass group might sell its 
holdings to Paramount, which on Monday dropped its $12.2-billion hostile bid 
for Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Paramount, which built itself into a media and entertainment 
conglomerate largely through acquisitions, indicated Monday that it would 
pursue other acquisitions or ventures after losing a Delaware court battle 
seeking to block Time's purchase of Warner Communications Inc.

CHINA JITTERS CUT LAND PRICE IN HONG KONG

<P>
The government on Wednesday sold the last prominent vacant plot in Hong Kong's 
financial district, a prime office development site, for $346 million. While 
the government claimed the sale was a significant indicator of confidence in 
Hong Kong, the purchase price was well below predictions made before the 
crackdown on student protest in China. 
</P>
<P>
The bid for the land was originally expected to set a record before the 
rocketing property boom took a knock last month as the events in Tian An Men 
Square in Beijing seriously shook Hong Kong, which is destined to return to 
Chinese control in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Early estimates for the property were about $500 million. After the Beijing 
crisis, however, the government, which put the site on the market, had lowered 
its aim to about $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered Good 
</P>
<P>
Great Eagle, a local property and construction company, bid in the name of 
Shinea Hill Development, a wholly owned subsidiary. It is setting up a 
consortium that includes C. Itoh, a Japanese trading house. 
</P>
<P>
Local bankers and analysts said Wednesday that the Great Eagle price was good 
given the prevailing political circumstances. They argued that it was in line 
with what could have been expected a year or so ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Pope, the government's acting director of building and lands, said he was 
"satisfied" with the winning bid. He said development of the site, which 
includes two office towers of 53 and 39 stories, would cost more than $600 
million, and was a "vote of confidence in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The winning bid was the highest of five, which ranged upwards from about $250 
million, in a public tender for the 92,000-squate-foot site, adjacent to a new 
Bank of China building. 
</P>
<P>
Most bids indicated a substantially greater slide in property market prices 
than the 20% fall forecast in recent weeks. Earlier indications of the price 
falls had come in an auction of smaller government-owned plots on Tuesday, 
which showed prices down by 20% to 25% on earlier predictions.

PRIME COMPUTER'S PLAN TO EVADE HOSTILE BID HITS SNAG

Prime Computer's plan to escape a hostile tender offer ran into a potential 
snag Wednesday when two banks asked Prime's white knight, J. H. Whitney &amp; 
Co., to raise more financing for its $1.4-billion buyout of the Massachusetts 
computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
Prime also postponed its annual meeting for the third time, saying it wanted to 
give shareholders more time to study a rival offer from MAI Basic Four, a 
Tustin computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney, a New York venture capital firm, emerged last month as a friendly 
suitor for Prime, which has been resisting hostile bids by MAI for eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Prime's board said the Whitney offer is "economically superior" 
to the most recent bid by MAI. That offer was to buy a part of Prime, its 
minicomputer business, for $450 million in cash and $150 million in notes.

<P>
But Chemical Bank and First National Bank of Boston told Whitney on Tuesday 
night that it will have to obtain additional financing because of Prime's 
deteriorating financial condition, according to a Whitney statement. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, Prime said it will report a loss of $19 million for its second 
quarter ended July 3, contrasted with earnings of $7.2 million a year ago. 
Prime said if it hadn't had $27 million in one-time expenses, most of which it 
attributed to the cost of the takeover battle, it would have had operating 
income of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney said it has been negotiating with "a major financial institution" to 
obtain financing to meet the banks' new requirement. But it said "there can be 
no assurances" that the additional financing can be obtained on terms 
satisfactory to the banks or Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, Prime stock fell $1.375 a share to 
close at $15.75 while MAI was down 37.5 cents, closing at $5.375. 
</P>
<P>
Prime said its decision to postpone its annual meeting until Aug. 9 was 
unrelated to the financing difficulties facing Whitney. The decision to delay 
the meeting was made after the Securities and Exchange Commission urged Prime 
to give shareholders more time to study MAI's latest proposal, said Joe 
Gavaghan, a company spokesman.

2ND JAILBREAK IN 4 DAYS FUELS SAFETY CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A downtown jailbreak on Tuesday -- the second in four days -- has prompted Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department officials to intensify security measures at 
separate detention facilities pending an investigation of the escapes. 
</P>
<P>
The escapes have heightened concerns about safety among East Los Angeles 
residents fighting a proposal to expand the county's Central Jail on Bauchet 
Street near downtown and a plan to build a $100-million state prison in an area 
that has 32 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pressing our luck," said Father John Moretta of Resurrection Catholic 
Church in Boyle Heights. "It is a time bomb any time you put dangerous 
prisoners so close to a community." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent jailbreak was confirmed at midnight Tuesday when a prisoner 
turned up missing during a lockdown and head count of the 1,735 inmates at 
Biscailuz Center on Eastern Avenue in East Los Angeles and the 6,880 inmates 
housed at the Central Jail, Deputy Bill Wehner said. 
</P>
<P>
William M. Anderson, 25, of Lennox, who was being held on robbery charges and a 
no-bail parole violation hold, apparently forced a fellow Central Jail inmate 
to switch identification wristbands with him, Wehner said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Climbed Fence 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Anderson was then (erroneously) transferred in that inmate's place from 
Central Jail to Biscailuz Center," Wehner said. "Once he was at Biscailuz, he 
escaped by climbing over a perimeter fence . . . which was rimmed with 
razor-wire." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was described as black; 5 feet, 8 inches tall; 180 pounds, with black 
hair, brown eyes, a close-cropped mustache and beard. Authorities said Anderson 
might be armed. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a prisoner escaped from the Central Jail using a rope fashioned from 
bedsheets to rappel three stories from the jail roof to the ground. The 
prisoner, Keith Williams, 28, was captured Tuesday afternoon at the Fox Hills 
shopping mall in Culver City when a jewelry store employee recognized him from 
news reports. 
</P>
<P>
Now, "we are intensifying whatever security measures are in place pending an 
investigation into all security aspects of both escapes," said Lt. Robert 
Briggs, who is in charge of County Jail operations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chairman Ed Edelman said he 
asked Sheriff Sherman Block on Wednesday for a formal report on both escapes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the sheriff is taking all steps to prevent another possibility of 
escape," Edelman added. 
</P>
<P>
Such assurances failed to calm the jangled nerves of some people who live and 
work just east of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"With these escapes, we can't let our children play outdoors as freely as we 
should," said Mary Lou Trevis, vice principal at San Antonio de Padua 
Elementary School, which is located three blocks away from the Central Jail. "I 
don't feel safe walking down the street' because I don't know whether I'll run 
into one of these escapees." 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood opposition in Chinatown and East Los Angeles has so far managed to 
help stall a proposal to add 2,400 beds to the Central Jail as part of an 
effort to alleviate severe overcrowding. The residents contend that their 
communities are already overloaded with existing or proposed jail facilities.

PANEL GIVES MALIBU A JOLT, PUTS COUNTY IN CHARGE OF SEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a stunning setback for Malibu cityhood supporters, the Local Agency 
Formation Commission on Wednesday reversed two earlier decisions and voted to 
allow Los Angeles County to retain control over sewers in the coastal community 
for up to 10 years after incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
The action means that if Malibu residents vote to support cityhood next year, 
the ballot measure would include a provision asking them to give the county 
jurisdiction over a planned regional sewer system that most Malibu homeowners 
now oppose. In fact, it was the county's 1987 plan to build a huge sewer system 
in Malibu that triggered the incorporation drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Opinion Rejected 
</P>
<P>
Although LAFCO members reaffirmed their support of Malibu's bid to vote on 
incorporation, the panel rejected its own legal counsel's opinion that the 
commission does not have the authority to give the county future jurisdiction 
over sewers. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu community leaders, upset over the cost and size of the proposed sewer 
system, believe that its construction would lead to widespread development in 
the rural coastal area. Residents face a minimum $10,000 assessment under the 
proposed sewer plan. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood advocates said they would consider a lawsuit challenging LAFCO's 
action but said they would wait until county supervisors set an election date 
to make that decision. The next possible election date is in April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"The tragedy today is that now we have to put out a ballot issue that is 
contaminated," said Larry Wan, president of the Malibu Township Council. "It 
will create a tremendous amount of confusion and much of the future city's 
authority has been impaired." 
</P>
<P>
Although the proposed 20-square-mile city has long been famous for its 
celebrities, surf and sandy beaches, during the last two years it has also 
become known for its struggle over sewers. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO had rejected two previous attempts by the county to make the cityhood 
measure contingent on the county's future control of sewers, voting down the 
request as recently as May. 
</P>
<P>
But the county once again asked the panel to reconsider its decision, and some 
intense lobbying of new LAFCO Commissioner Walt Tucker, the absence of panel 
member Nell Mirels and a decision by LAFCO Chairman Thomas Jackson to 
disqualify himself from the Malibu incorporation issue earlier this year, 
resulted in a surprise 4-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker gave a terse response when asked after Wednesday's two-hour hearing why 
he reversed his position, saying that he didn't "fully understand the issue" 
when he voted to reject the county's request in May. Mirels was on vacation and 
Jackson has declined to say why he disqualified himself after supporting 
Malibu's cityhood bid for more than 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Deane Dana, a member of LAFCO, asked the panel to support the 
sewer condition, arguing that the waste-water disposal system was needed to 
ensure that "adequate public services are being provided" to the millions that 
visit the famed beachside haven each year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the county declared that a public health hazard exists in Malibu 
because of leaking septic systems, a move that allowed the supervisors to 
approve a sewer system without a vote of the community's 20,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot favor the position of a few residents over the welfare of an entire 
county," Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Supervisor Ed Edelman, who also serves on LAFCO, voted against the 
sewer condition, arguing that the county would retain "whatever jurisdiction it 
is entitled to under the law." He said that if LAFCO approved the county's 
request, "we would simply be inviting more litigation." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors unanimously approved a $43-million sewer system for Malibu in 
January, and county officials have been attempting to move quickly on the sewer 
issue before the residents have a chance to vote on cityhood. The California 
Coastal Commission is scheduled to review the county's sewer plan in September. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO's action will also allow the county to retain control over an assessment 
district in Malibu's Big Rock Mesa, site of a massive landslide that destroyed 
or damaged more than 250 homes several years ago. Earlier this year, the county 
agreed to pay $35 million of a $97-million settlement to Big Rock homeowners 
for its role in approving development in the landslide area. 
</P>
<P>
The county recently told angry Big Rock residents that they may have to pay up 
to $100,000 for an extensive pumping system designed to remove water from the 
hillsides, as well as a separate assessment for the proposed sewer system.

AIRPORT CONTRACTS DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

In a presentation intended to dispel concerns about the role of its minority 
and female partners, Duty Free Shoppers Group Ltd. Partnership on Wednesday 
assured Los Angeles airport officials that the partners are directly involved 
in running gift and duty-free shops at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Duty Free Shoppers officials promised the Board of Airport Commissioners that 
the minority- and female-run firms will assume virtual control of shops at two 
airport terminals by the end of the year. They said the practical experience in 
running the shops is intended to prepare the two firms -- Mir Kanon Inc. and 
Peideau Inc. -- to operate such businesses on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really proud of our majority partners for accepting us and in allowing 
us to learn their business the way they have," said Iris D. Rideau, who 
represented Peideau at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Concession contracts at the city-owned airport, including those with Duty Free 
Shoppers, are under investigation by city officials because they appear to lack 
the level of participation by minority partners that federal guidelines 
require. The guidelines are designed to increase participation by disadvantaged 
minorities and women in contracts by giving them clearly defined, hands-on 
roles in running the concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Airport commissioners, however, said Wednesday that they were satisfied with 
Duty Free Shoppers' explanations. "I think that this report exemplifies what 
the mayor has been saying to us for a long time," Commission President Jerry B. 
Epstein said. "If we can extend this formula that you are doing to other 
industries here, you will have really set a tremendous example of what can be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
The Duty Free Shoppers contracts have drawn particular attention because Mir 
Kanon and Peideau have the same 10 partners, including Betty Dixon, the wife of 
Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), who heads the House Ethics Committee. 
Duty Free Shoppers, the world's largest duty-free concessionnaire, brought in 
the 10 partners to boost its chances of winning contracts to operate shops at 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Dixon was not at Wednesday's meeting but has acknowledged that she has 
not served in any hands-on management position in one Duty Free Shoppers 
contract and has been involved only "on a limited basis" in another. 
</P>
<P>
Duty Free Shoppers officials did not directly address the level of Dixon's 
involvement except to assure the airport commissioners that "all shareholders 
of Mir Kanon and Peideau attend Management Committee meetings every six 
months." They also said representatives from the two firms attend monthly 
meetings that oversee operations of the duty-free concession and the gift and 
news concession. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Lyons, vice president of business development for Duty Free Shoppers, 
acknowledged, however, that when differences arise about running the stores, 
Duty Free, which has a 68% interest in the joint venture, has the final say. 
The Department of Airports has set a goal of giving minority-owned businesses a 
20% stake in companies that get contracts, and female-owned businesses 12%. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation was held in response to questions from the commission 
following news reports about Dixon's role in the firms. The substance of 
Wednesday's meeting mirrored a letter last month from Duty Free Shoppers to 
Clifton Moore, the airport department's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Moore told The Times in June that he was critical of Dixon's role in the joint 
venture because her limited involvement in the airport concessions "does not 
seem to be consistent" with the minority participation program approved by the 
department.

ACLU CHARGES HARASSMENT OF AIDS ACTIVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday accused the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department of harassing AIDS activists in an effort to silence 
critics of the county's AIDS policies. 
</P>
<P>
In a seven-page letter to Sheriff Sherman Block, ACLU attorneys demanded an end 
to alleged searches and surveillance of members of the AIDS Coalition to 
Unleash Power/Los Angeles (ACT UP/LA). 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking that the Sheriff's Department stop harassing people based on 
their lawful political activism," said ACLU attorney Jon Davidson. "If police 
are allowed to intimidate and harass people who protest government action, then 
all people who complain about the actions of politicians are in danger." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson charged that sheriff's deputies have been covertly photographing 
participants in AIDS demonstrations and have followed and illegally searched 
the car of an ACT UP/LA member without producing a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson said he based his allegations on discussions with AIDS activists. He 
demanded in the letter that the sheriff, under the California Public Records 
Act, turn over all documents relating to searches and surveillance of coalition 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Block was unavailable for comment Wednesday. A spokesman declined to comment on 
specific charges contained in the letter, but issued a brief statement noting 
that the department recently completed an investigation resulting in 
misdemeanor charges against three members of the group for allegedly spraying 
graffiti on county buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson called the charges groundless and said they were "further evidence of 
an attempt by the county to suppress speech critical of its inaction in the 
face of the AIDS crisis." 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activists have accused the Board of Supervisors of lacking commitment in 
the fight against the disease. But members of of ACT UP/LA have denied that the 
group was responsible for the vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of whether or not a few individuals who happen to be members of ACT 
UP/LA participated in painting graffiti on county buildings, there was and 
continues to be no ground to investigate other ACT UP/LA members or to harass 
the organization or its members," Davidson said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson said in an interview that if the harassment continues, he will 
consider filing suit against the sheriff alleging violations of the AIDS 
activists' civil rights. He said the suit could result in civil penalties 
against the sheriff and the county. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU lawyer said he wrote the letter after being contacted by members of 
the AIDS coalition. 
</P>
<P>
He said the harassment has included sheriff's deputies "surreptitiously 
monitoring and photographing numerous ACT UP/LA lawful demonstrations and press 
conferences," detaining and following ACT UP/LA members and searching an ACT 
UP/LA member's car "without his or anyone else's consent and without showing a 
search warrant to anyone."

L.A. DISASTER OFFICIALS GET SOME NEW WHEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With ambitious plans for a "command-and-control" helicopter still in a holding 
pattern, Los Angeles officials are about to unveil two less exotic vehicles to 
help them respond to earthquakes and other emergencies -- a pair of huge 
recreational vehicles converted to provide work space close to a disaster site 
for as many as 31 city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-foot-long roving "war rooms" basically re-create on wheels the emergency 
operations center buried four floors below City Hall, where department heads 
now gather to coordinate relief efforts. Dominated by rows of high-tech 
workstations, the vehicles are designed to be connected at the scene to two 
trailers, one carrying a power generator and the other filled with 
communications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"No other government agency has what we're putting together," Los Angeles 
Police Cmdr. George A. Morrison said of the $1.5-million cluster of RVs and 
trailers known as the Mobile Alternate Emergency Operations Center. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, for Morrison and other members of the city's Emergency Operations 
Board, the ultimate dream remains a one-of-a-kind helicopter that would enable 
top managers from various departments to hover over the wreckage of the Big One 
for as long as three hours. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Bids on Copter 
</P>
<P>
Officials announced plans for the airborne control center two years ago, 
envisioning a craft housing six computerized workstations hooked into video 
cameras, infrared heat sensors and night-vision equipment. If a bridge were 
destroyed, for instance, transportation and public works officials would be 
able to decide immediately if it could be repaired and select alternate 
evacuation routes. 
</P>
<P>
After the plan won City Council approval and a 136-page bid request was sent to 
manufacturers, the expectation was that the helicopter would take flight by 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
But there was one problem -- the city's cost estimate of $4.5 million was so 
unrealistic that no one would bid on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Now city officials are getting ready to propose the copter again to the 
council's Finance and Revenue Committee, this time with an estimated price tag 
of $8 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come into this on a phase basis," Morrison said. "The helicopter is 
the last phase. . . . I'm pretty optimistic we can come in close to the $8 
million." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, however, emergency response teams will have to rely on the 
custom-fitted RVs if the underground City Hall center is disabled or if they 
decide that a command post should be established near the spot most heavily 
damaged by an earthquake, brush fire, winter storm, toxic leak or other 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Final Touches 
</P>
<P>
The General Services Department is putting final touches on the 13-foot-high 
vehicles in a caged area of the fortified C. Erwin Piper Technical Center, 
where the police air support division and its 15 helicopters are based. 
</P>
<P>
One of the RVs has 15 work stations, the other 16. At each station, a worker 
will face a control panel that can accommodate a lap-top computer and tune in 
18 radio frequencies or the city's microwave TV system, which can transmit 
pictures of the damage taken by video cameras aboard police or fire 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that this is going to sit around and wait for the San Andreas Fault 
to go," Morrison said. "We will probably use it for training purposes on minor 
emergencies . . . just to test it, give it a shakedown cruise."

PARENTS PROTEST BUSING OF STUDENTS FROM SCHOOL SHUT BY TARRY SEEPAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As hundreds of children began boarding school buses, more than 100 angry 
parents Wednesday protested the busing of students from Park Avenue Elementary 
School in Cudahy, where a tar-like substance seeping into the schoolyard forced 
the school's closure. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 650 students enrolled at Park Avenue, 244 failed to report for school 
Wednesday, school officials said, many of them kept at home by parents who 
opposed their busing to a South-Central Los Angeles school where they feared 
possible gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying placards and shouting, "Hell no! We won't go," the parents said they 
were not sending their children to Russell Elementary School seven miles away 
because it is too far from their community and located in a neighborhood they 
consider unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a bad, rough, gang-troubled area," said George Perez, a parent and one 
of the leaders of the protest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Dispel Notion 
</P>
<P>
School officials, however, sought to dispel the notion that Russell Elementary 
is unsafe and told parents that violence is not a problem at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Leonard Britton last week issued an 
order closing the year-round Park Avenue school after the Environmental 
Protection Agency took samples of the substance in the schoolyard and launched 
an investigation into it earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
For years, The tar-like ooze has periodically seeped through the playground 
asphalt. Parents of some students attributed their children's skin rashes to 
the substance, although school officials said there was no evidence that it had 
made anyone sick. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 244 students who did not report for classes Wednesday, school officials 
said 23 were absent because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents, such as Perez, said they would keep their children home until 
school officials decided to transfer them to schools in the Cudahy area. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll teach my children at home," said Delia Ramirez, a mother of an 8-year-old 
third-grader and a 9-year-old fourth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stressed Out' 
</P>
<P>
Bernice Garcia, 15, picketing with her mother, Anna Garcia, said her sister, 
Vanessa, an 11-year-old sixth-grader, was "too stressed out" to ride the bus. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing has made her sick. She is stressed from what is happening 
here," Anna Garcia said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials said Russell Elementary at Firestone Boulevard and 
Hooper Avenue is not plagued by gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"Russell is a nice school. It is not in the middle of gang territory," said 
Maria Casillas, superintendent for the school district region that includes 
Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
Some Russell schoolteachers and administrators were on hand to greet the 
arriving Park Avenue students. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hurt by the image portraying our school as gang-infested. It isn't," 
teacher Devota Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The move drew mixed reviews from the students. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-year-old sixth-grader in teacher Francis Copeland-Newman's class at 
Russell, did not like the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't live near here. I walked to Park Avenue. I wish I was back there," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation by a private consultant for the school district 
indicates that the substance oozing from beneath the asphalt "is highly 
acidic." Health and environmental agency officials have said that students 
could be endangered only if they eat the substance or come into prolonged 
contact with it. 
</P>
<P>
A portion of the school is built on a landfill, and the tar-like substance is 
believed to come from the refuse and petroleum products that were dumped there. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said it could take anywhere from 12 to 18 months to assess the 
extent of the problem. The EPA test results are expected within three months.

INSTITUTE IN IRVINE TO ASSESS HEALTH RISKS OF CHEMICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a time when consumers are increasingly worried about the unknown chemical 
hazards in what they eat and drink, a unique Orange County research institute 
was established Wednesday to help assess those risks. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists from around the country gathered in Irvine to launch the Institute 
for Evaluating Health Risks, the nation's first independent, nonprofit agency 
designed to evaluate how dangerous certain chemicals are to consumers and in 
what amounts. 
</P>
<P>
The new institute will be at the Beckman Center of the National Academies of 
Science and Engineering in Irvine, an arm of the Washington-based academy. 
</P>
<P>
The institute is a response to California's Proposition 65 toxics-control law, 
which requires businesses to warn consumers about toxic chemicals in amounts 
that pose a "significant risk" and bans discharge of such toxics into drinking 
water sources. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists said they expect the institute to become the nation's leading center 
for risk-assessment work because heretofore there have been no organizations 
that could provide comprehensive research on health-risk issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Chemicals Evaluated 
</P>
<P>
At present, only a few of the 300 chemicals targeted by Proposition 65 have 
been evaluated by the federal government to determine what amounts pose a 
significant risk. 
</P>
<P>
"If the institute is successful in providing good risk assessments, its impact 
will spread across the country," said Charles Powers, founder of the institute 
and its acting director. "If crummy research is being conducted, it won't work. 
What is defined by the industry as crummy is research done by the government. 
What the government defines as crummy is research done by industry. This 
institute is a means to get around that." 
</P>
<P>
Powers said that funding for the institute will come from both the public and 
private sector and that much of its work will include contracts with government 
and industry for specific chemical assessments. 
</P>
<P>
Powers pointed out, however, that many elements -- including how the agency is 
organized and what substances it will tackle first -- must still be determined. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Moore, who in September will become the institute's executive director, 
said it must also determine the best way to separate itself from the political 
and economic biases of politicians and industry. 
</P>
<P>
"When there is a new idea or a different way something can be done, one should 
point out in a cold, objective, coherent way what will be the impact of taking 
Option A or Option B. That is something this institute can and should do," said 
Moore, who most recently served as the acting administrator of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders in the environmental movement reacted cautiously to creation of the 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like it to succeed," said David B. Roe, an attorney for the 
Environmental Defense Fund and a principal author of Proposition 65. "It will 
depend on what jobs they take on and how quickly they produce results. I am 
skeptical because some industry groups have tried to co-opt scientific bodies, 
and they will certainly try to co-opt this one." 
</P>
<P>
But Roe said the composition of the institute's board of directors will be an 
important factor in gaining support of environmentalists, as well as academic 
institutions, industry officials and government. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Melvin Lane, publisher of Sunset Magazine, former chairman of the 
California Coastal Commission and a member of the advisory council of the 
Sierra Club, predicted that most environmentalists will welcome the institute. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to be convinced that we are doing competent and intelligent work," 
he said. "I think we will get enough government money to negate the perception 
of any conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 65, the burden of proof for determining whether a risk is 
"significant" was shifted to industry, and that shift has created an urgent 
demand for speedy evaluation of chemicals and substances. 
</P>
<P>
The shift has also changed the way that science looks at risk assessment and 
has prompted the need for a method to explain risks in a way that the public 
can understand, while also meeting the demands of industry, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
The institute "must be organized . . . with careful attention to becoming 
recognized as rendering its judgments . . . in ways that are objective, highly 
competent and understandable to the public which needs this information," 
Powers emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Lane on the board are Stanford University President Donald Kennedy; 
three University of California chancellors, Richard Atkinson of San Diego, 
Theodore Huller of Davis and Rosemary Schraer of Riverside; Hewlett-Packard 
chairman David Packard, and William Ballhaus, formerly chief executive officer 
of Beckman Instruments.

Working mothers spent $14 billion in 1986 on care for children younger than 15, 
with poor women paying disproportionately high percentages of their family 
income, the U.S. Census Bureau reported. In the most detailed survey of working 
women's child care arrangements yet conducted, the bureau spotlighted 
disparities that are fueling a drive on Capitol Hill toward child care help for 
poor families. About a third of the 18.2 million working mothers with children 
under 15 made cash payments for child care, paying on average $45 a week, or 6% 
of their monthly family income, the survey found. But women in poverty who paid 
for child care devoted 22% of their income -- about $32 a week -- to it. More 
than 29 million children -- 9 million of them younger than five -- had mothers 
who worked full or part time in 1986, said Martin O'Connell, chief of the 
Census' fertility statistics branch.

Hundreds of bemedaled war veterans paid tribute Wednesday to France's greatest 
woman Resistance leader, who died last Thursday at the age of 80. 
</P>
<P>
Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, the only woman to have led a major Resistance force, 
was a young, middle-class mother when she gave up her comfortable life style in 
1940 to join the underground movement fighting the Nazi occupation of France. 
</P>
<P>
From 1941 until the liberation of France in 1944, she was in charge of 3,000 
members of one of the country's most important Resistance networks, known as 
"Noah's Ark," the only woman to hold such a senior position. 
</P>
<P>
She was arrested in the south of France in 1944 but managed to escape by 
squeezing through the bars of her cell.

CITY ATTORNEY URGED TO WRAP UP BRADLEY PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro urged the city attorney 
Wednesday to rapidly conclude his investigation of Mayor Tom Bradley's 
financial affairs to stem the growing distrust in government created by the 
lingering probe. 
</P>
<P>
"It is vital to all parties concerned, including Mayor Bradley, that the facts 
are determined and the issues resolved as soon as possible," Ferraro said in a 
letter to City Atty. James K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
"The delay in the completion of your investigation and report is a matter of 
increasing concern to me, the public and to many other members of the council," 
Ferraro wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"However," he continued later in the letter, "we cannot ignore the growing 
unrest and demands for an expeditious and conclusive resolution of these 
matters. Until this occurs, there will be further erosion in the public's 
confidence in government and in the ability of its elected officials to conduct 
the business of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro offered Hahn any help needed, including additional investigators, to 
reach a "speedy and thorough" conclusion of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn was expected to issue a comment later in the day, his spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, appearing at a council meeting on an unrelated topic, told reporters 
that he also hoped the inquiry would reach an end soon, but was concerned that 
the council might interfere with Hahn's probe. 
</P>
<P>
"The city attorney has been conducting his inquiry for four months. I am 
anxious that there be a full inquiry, that it be expeditious, and I would hope 
that nothing that the council does will delay that expeditious process." 
</P>
<P>
In related developments, the furor over Bradley's alleged use of his office to 
help Far East National Bank, which paid him $18,000 in 1988 as its only paid 
adviser, sparked a conflict Wednesday over swearing in witnesses testifying at 
committee hearings about the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"People are lying and they've got to be placed under oath so they can be 
punished," Councilman Nate Holden said. "If they're not put under oath, then we 
should discontinue this whole dog and pony show." 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro introduced a motion during a council meeting giving the chairmen of the 
two committees investigating the mayor's role in a $2-million deposit of city 
funds at Far East the power to "require" their witnesses to testify under oath. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro said all council members now have the power under the City Charter to 
administer the oaths, but they cannot as individuals or committees compel sworn 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
His motion, which will be considered Tuesday, gives them that ability. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the committee would put people under oath, so if they do 
make a statement that's perjury, then there's a penalty involved," Ferraro 
said. "We want the truth, and I think the public is demanding it, and all we're 
doing is representing the public in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he would not object to requiring oaths, but he refused to answer a 
reporter's question whether he would honor Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores' 
request that he make a full account of his actions involving Far East to the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no objection to it, so far," he said. "I don't think there's been any 
indication of a need for it, but certainly if it's appropriate, I would have no 
objection to it. I hope that the actions of the council will serve not to delay 
this process." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who is chairman of the Finance and Revenue 
Committee, acknowledged "somebody is lying" in accounts to his committee, but 
he said he had no immediate plans to compel sworn testimony. He also declined 
to say specifically who was not telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg appeared Monday and Tuesday before Yaroslavsky's 
committee to answer charges in an audit by the City Administrative Office that 
he violated city policy in depositing $2 million in Far East without taking 
competitive bids. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Corser, the city's chief administrative analyst, told the committee on 
Monday that a reference next to the Far East bid sheet that the deposits were 
made "per the mayor" was whited out with correction fluid and a black felt 
marker was used to draw a line across the back of the page in an apparent 
attempt to cover up the reference. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenberg told the committee that he has not gotten a straight answer from his 
staff over who deleted the reference, and the two most likely involved point to 
each other as the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
The two individuals, William Hoss, a cash management officer, and George 
Sehlmeyer, an investment officer, were to appear before Yaroslavksy's committee 
Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning.

RESIDENTS CLING TO A 'TREASURE'; 
</P>
<P>
CHANGES WORRY MOBILE HOME PARK DWELLERS 
</P>

<P>
Arched on gentle bluffs overlooking a curving sweep of the Pacific Ocean, 
Treasure Island Mobile Home Park in Laguna Beach is, by all accounts, choice 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of four undeveloped, privately owned oceanfront tracts in Orange 
County," said Richard A. Hall of Costa Mesa, who, along with some partners, 
purchased the 27-acre tract last September. 
</P>
<P>
Located just north of Aliso Beach off Coast Highway, the park provides its 500 
residents with modest homes and billion-dollar views. But in recent months, 
they have become alarmed, and agitated, about the transfer of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear Losing Homes 
</P>
<P>
"People fear they'll be losing their homes," said Michael Kenney, president of 
the homeowners' association. The concern, he said, was a prospectus put out by 
Hall's company that calls for developing the land into multimillion-dollar 
homes and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, however, Hall said that he has no immediate plans 
for such a move and countered that he even had planned to offer long-term 
leases to the present tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it will always be a mobile home park, but I have no plans for 
the foreseeable future," Hall said. He noted that city zoning and California 
Coastal Commission plan approvals are among the long, time-consuming steps 
required before the property could be developed into homes and condos. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite Hall's assurances, residents remain worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what they say, I know what these people want, and it's big bucks 
-- big bucks that come from development," said May Brown, 70, a retiree who has 
been a resident of Treasure Island for the last 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I moved here because we wanted to spend the rest of our lives 
here," she explained. "We love it. But we're worried about what's going to 
happen. You see, we mobile home owners own our homes but not the land under it. 
And the owner can keep raising the rent until people can't afford it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who retired after 30 years as a motion picture and television script 
supervisor in Los Angeles, said her current mobile home rental is $1,100 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"If the rents keep going higher, my husband and I are very worried," she said. 
"We're retired and on fixed income." 
</P>
<P>
Brown noted that before South Laguna was annexed by Laguna Beach, Treasure 
Island residents fought a plan for the park to be converted into a $90-million, 
time-share resort hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, a partnership of proposed developers won approval from both 
the Orange County Planning Commission and the state Coastal Commission to build 
a high-rise, time-share hotel on the park. Tenants were to be relocated to 
apartments under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"But we took them to court, and finally it got to the point that it wasn't 
financially feasible for the developers to proceed, so they withdrew," Brown 
recalled. "If we hadn't fought back then, we all would have had to move in 
1981. Darn right, we fought." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry said the city is watching the situation 
"because we don't want these longtime residents, many of whom are retired, to 
lose their homes there." 
</P>
<P>
Fear and rumors began sweeping the mobile home park more than a year ago when 
word spread that the two brothers who owned the park, Howard and Warren 
Hopkins, had plans to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
"We residents made an offer of $40 million for the park, but we never heard 
firsthand from the owners about our offer," Kenney said. He added that he later 
learned the park had been sold for $43 million to a partnership which includes 
the Richard A. Hall Co. of Costa Mesa. Escrow on the sale is scheduled to close 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
Kenney said residents became fearful that the new owners planned to oust them. 
The uneasiness was aggravated when the residents' association was leaked a copy 
of Hall's prospectus for developing the property, Kenney said. 
</P>
<P>
The prospectus said, among other things, that Hall "intends to convert the 
subject parcel from a mobile home park to a residential development which would 
include about 50 home sites and a mid-rise condominium development. The subject 
property is currently zoned VSR-2 (Visitor-Serving Recreation Area), which 
allows boating, residential homes, condominiums, retail, hotel and motel uses." 
</P>
<P>
Hall acknowledged that his prospectus called for developing the mobile home 
park. But he said that that was a "long-range plan" and that current tenants 
should not worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer we hold the property, the more valuable it gets," he said. "But 
obviously that property at Treasure Island is not going to be for mobile homes 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
To head off any quick attempt by new owners to develop the property, the 
Treasure Island Residents Owners Assn. last December petitioned the Laguna 
Beach City Council to put a legal hold, or moratorium, on the acceptance and 
processing of any new development applications for mobile home parks in the 
city. The council agreed to the request, and a temporary moratorium is now in 
place, Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city staff and the City Council have been very supportive and sympathetic 
to the residents of Treasure Island," Kenney said. Nonetheless, he noted that 
the moratorium is scheduled to end this winter, and the city must decide what 
permanent zoning to put on Treasure Island. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the land permanently zoned for mobile homes," Kenney said. Hall, by 
contrast, said his company hopes to keep the land at its present zoning, which 
allows home and condominium construction. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is once Hall owns the land, he will cause rents to go up 
considerably higher because he'll be interested in moving us out of our homes 
and developing that land," Kenney said. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry, in a separate interview, said he also got the impression that Hall's 
plans called for developing Treasure Island into home sites and building condos 
on part of the land. "I was told that the company would move the tenants into 
the condos and let them live there for the same rent they are now paying," 
Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor added: "That may sound OK, but I found out that these mobile home 
residents very much prefer to live in their own homes. They don't want to move 
into condos or apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the city could get more tax money if it favored apartments and hotels for 
that land, but getting more money is not our interest. Our interest is in 
seeing that these people who live there are not uprooted from their 
neighborhood. We're going to work to see that they're well taken care of."

<P>
SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT TO BE SET UP FRIDAY NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
La Palma police plan to set up a sobriety checkpoint somewhere within the city 
limits Friday night in an effort to deter drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-drunk driving safeguard is the third in a series undertaken jointly by 
police in La Palma, Cypress, Los Alamitos and Seal Beach. About 18 officers 
from the four departments will make random stops of cars at the checkpoint, 
speak briefly with the driver, and -- if necessary in the officer's judgment -- 
conduct a visual test of balance and coordination to spot possible drunk 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
La Palma Police Chief Police Norman Hansen, citing the "psychological 
influence" that advance notice of the program may have on those who might drink 
and drive, stressed that the checkpoint "is not expected to produce a dramatic 
number of arrests, but rather (to) reduce the number of drunk drivers." 
</P>
<P>
The location of the checkpoint will be announced to media two hours before the 
start of the checks, police said.

<P>
MAN ARRESTED AFTER ALL-NIGHT STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Special weapons and tactics deputies arrested an armed, distraught man early 
Wednesday after he had barricaded himself in a garage for an all-night 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Jones Morgan, 47, was being held on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon after he allegedly fired several shots at his wife. He then retreated to 
his garage, where he refused to come out and repeatedly threatened to kill 
himself, Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Robert Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
At about 9 p.m. Tuesday, deputies went to the home in the 12000 block of Dunas 
Road in North Tustin after receiving a report of shots being fired, Rivas said. 
After Morgan's wife and teen-age son escaped through a window of the house, 
deputies called for Morgan to come out of the detached garage. 
</P>
<P>
Crisis negotiators talked with Morgan through the night as the man waved a 
.9-millimeter pistol and threatened suicide. At about 7:10 a.m. Wednesday, SWAT 
deputies hurled flash-bang grenades into the garage to distract Morgan and then 
captured him.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPROMISE SET ON HISTORIC HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a five-year battle over saving historic homes in Redondo Beach, the City 
Council has decided on a compromise approach that would raise barriers to quick 
demolition but ultimately allow owners to tear down and replace them. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have decided to create an eight-member Preservation Commission, 
effective Sept. 1. Under the measure, owners of buildings deemed to have 
unusual historic and architectural significance will be temporarily forestalled 
from demolishing, relocating or substantially altering their exteriors without 
the commission's approval. 
</P>
<P>
The protection covers only single-family homes that have been designated as 
landmarks or are in a historic district, and expires after 225 days.

BRAIN SCAN ON KRAFT SHOWS ABNORMALITY, PROFESSOR TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A brain scan of serial killer Randy Steven Kraft shows that he suffers from an 
abnormality that could affect "emotional, impulsive, and sexual behavior," a UC 
Irvine psychiatry professor testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony by Dr. Monte S. Buchsbaum, director of UCI's Brain Imaging Center, 
marked the first time jurors have heard the defense waver at all from its 
position that Kraft is innocent of all 16 murders of which he was convicted on 
May 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy still maintains he is innocent," said Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald 
outside the courtroom in Santa Ana. "But if the jurors believe he is guilty, 
we're only saying maybe there is a reason. Maybe it was something beyond his 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum, testifying about the PET, or positron emission tomography, scan at 
Kraft's death penalty hearing, acknowledged on cross-examination that some 
leading authorities claim such brain tests are too experimental for use in 
criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum also acknowledged that a more standard brain-scan test on Kraft four 
years ago, an EEG or electroencephalogram, showed no abnormalities. But he 
testified that the PET scan can measure deeper into the brain than an EEG and 
can better reach areas that control sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum said the problem could stem from a head injury Kraft suffered when he 
was 1 year old. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, now 44, is accused by prosecutors in court papers of 45 murders of young 
men in Southern California, Oregon, and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Bodies of the victims, most of them between 18 and 25 years old, were usually 
dumped along freeway ramps or in remote areas. Most had been sexually 
mutilated, or showed some signs of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft acknowledges that he is gay. But in questioning witnesses himself, Kraft 
has tried to elicit a portrait of himself as a conservative gay man, not given 
to extreme sexual aberrations. 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum told jurors that in most areas, Kraft's brain was quite normal, which 
would explain his high intelligence and his ability to communicate well with 
co-workers. The brain area affected controls "a narrow spectrum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum's testimony did not include any details about what extremes might 
result from Kraft's alleged brain abnormality. But he did say that test results 
showed a significant difference from the norm, based on PET scans of 24 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
While other brain-scan tests measure electrical impulses, or the structure of 
the brain, a PET scan measures how the brain is functioning. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are about two dozen PET scan centers across the country, 
including three in California, Buchsbaum admitted under questioning by Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown that it is a new procedure for criminal trials. In 
fact, Buchsbaum said he believes he is the only PET scan expert involved in 
criminal cases today. And he has only testified in three other cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Depression Could Have Been Factor in Test 
</P>
<P>
Brown questioned whether "depression" might have caused Kraft's test results. 
After all, Brown said, the test occurred on May 31, just two weeks after 
Kraft's conviction. He also reminded the professor that Kraft has been in the 
Orange County Jail for more than six years. Depression could not be ruled out, 
Buchsbaum answered. In fact, he had written several years ago that depression 
could interfere with test results. But Buchsbaum quickly added that he doubted 
depression was a factor, based on recent experimental tests on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum also testified that "it would be consistent" with the test results 
for Kraft to display some signs of the organic damage. For example, bursts of 
anger would not be surprising, Buchsbaum acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kraft's long list of character witnesses have all insisted that Kraft 
rarely displayed any temper, was always quiet and reserved. After Buchsbaum's 
testimony, prosecutor Brown asked a Kraft character witness whether he had ever 
seen Kraft angry, a question that until Wednesday had been more typical of the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Even Kraft smiled at this switch in the lawyers' positions. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft lawyer McDonald was pleased with Buchsbaum's testimony. And McDonald said 
he doesn't consider it inconsistent with his earlier arguments that Kraft is 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
"If the jury's position is (that) Randy is guilty, we can at least show them it 
wasn't because he is an evil person; it's something organic he can't do 
anything about." 
</P>
<P>
Another witness Wednesday was Rabbi Leonard Beerman of West Los Angeles, now 
retired, who said he believed after talking to Kraft that he is a considerate, 
caring individual who should be spared the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you ask Mr. Kraft whether he had killed any of these young boys?" Brown 
asked the rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
"No, but Randy did tell me he was innocent," Beerman answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you believe him?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, yes I did," Beerman answered the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Beerman also said he opposes the death penalty, not only for Kraft but for 
people such as Adolf Hitler and Adolf Eichmann, who "murdered my own people."

MAN WAS RUN OVER 3 TIMES FOR A THRILL, PROSECUTORS CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prosecutor told jurors Wednesday that Dallas Keith Carter ran over a victim 
with his car three times because he had "built himself up to a crescendo" of 
violent behavior the night that it happened and committed murder "for his own 
perverted pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 19, of Costa Mesa could face a sentence of 25 years to life in prison 
if convicted in the May 15, 1988, death of motorcyclist Javier G. Sarabia, 23, 
of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Carter, then 18, and two other men robbed Sarabia and 
his brother, Alex, at gunpoint in Garden Grove. The victim reportedly got into 
a struggle with Carter, who knocked him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they could hear shouts from the car of "Hit him again!" as 
Carter revved the motor and aimed his car at Sarabia, lying on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
After running over him once, the witnesses said, Carter made a U-turn and ran 
over Sarabia again. Two of the three witnesses said they saw him run over the 
victim at least a third time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Passengers Both Pleaded Guilty 
</P>
<P>
The two passengers in the car with Carter, Ernest J. Busto of Garden Grove, now 
21, and Sergio Sanchez, 19, of Santa Ana, both pleaded guilty to lesser charges 
of assault with a deadly weapon and are awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Carter testified that he had been drinking so much that he was not clear on 
what happened, but that he may have thought he was running over a speed bump. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey L. Robinson told jurors in closing arguments 
Wednesday in Superior Court in Santa Ana that the speed-bump argument is an 
insult to their intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
"If you believe that, let him walk; acquit him," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors began their deliberations late in the day and are scheduled to 
continue today. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said Carter and his friends had gotten drunk at a party and obtained 
possession of a gun, which gave them confidence to go on a crime spree. 
</P>
<P>
They reportedly committed two robberies before spotting the Sarabia brothers on 
a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers, with Alex driving, were heading east on West Street when Carter, 
driving in the opposite direction, made a U-turn and began following them. The 
Sarabias were forced off the road on Morgan Lane and confronted by Carter and 
the others, who robbed the brothers at gunpoint, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson pointed out that Carter had shot the pistol during one of the earlier 
robberies, "just to be a big guy . . . just wanting to get in the face of 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
The evening was building to a crescendo, Robinson said, because Carter was 
getting "more and more turned on" by their violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
Sarabia, Robinson said, "had the audacity to question what they were doing. But 
this guy wasn't going to come on to Big Bad Dallas and get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Roger B. Alexander argued that Carter's actions were the 
result of "confusion, alcohol and fear." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Carter's blood-alcohol content that night was 0.15%, well above 
the legal maximum for driving a car. 
</P>
<P>
Carter "was drunk, he was scared and he started to panic," Alexander told the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
He also argued that whatever Carter may have done, his actions did not amount 
to first-degree murder, which is the conviction that Robinson is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson countered that alcohol may be a factor in someone's actions but not an 
excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Alcohol cannot be used as a shield against justice," Robinson said. "If it 
could, we'd have an awful lot of empty prisons." 
</P>
<P>
Carter's actions amount to first-degree premeditated murder, he said, because 
"he deliberately aimed two tons of steel at the victim, revved the engine, and 
headed right for him." 
</P>
<P>
And not just once, Robinson noted. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy district attorney admitted to jurors that he is worried about their 
reaction, because Carter is a small, soft-spoken man, with a polite demeanor 
from the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not Charlie Manson," Robinson said. "But he's not some angelic guy out 
for peace and love and harmonious relationships in society, either. The guy you 
see here in court is not the guy who was out there on that night of incredible 
horror."

WHITE SOX WIN FOR 11TH TIME IN LAST 12 GAMES

<P>
The batter is the enemy. That's what Chicago manager Jeff Torborg told Greg 
Hibbard. 
</P>
<P>
"Be mean and be aggressive," Torborg said to his pitcher, "and quit going out 
to the mound and treating the opposing players as if they're your best 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
Hibbard allowed three hits in 6 2/3 innings Wednesday as the Chicago White Sox 
beat the Seattle Mariners 5-3 for their 11th victory in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing you can't do when you get up here is to be intimidated by the 
play at the big-league level," Torborg said. "He's got big-league stuff, but 
sometimes you get banged around as he has. And, with the kind of stuff he has, 
the defense occasionally has to be set because he throws a lot of ground 
balls." 
</P>
<P>
Hibbard struck out five and walked one against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to change my attitude and be mean," he said. "Not mean where I 
look mean, but just inside. Because those guys are trying to hurt me. And I 
have to try and go out there to hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Hillegas allowed two runs in two-thirds of an inning and Bobby Thigpen 
got five outs for his 21st save. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Swift, 6-3, lost his fifth consecutive decision against Chicago since Oct. 
3, 1985, giving up six hits and three runs in six innings. He will be sent back 
to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, the White Sox did a great job against us and were swept by a 
red-hot team," Mariners manager Jim Lefebvre said. "My guys may have been 
looking ahead to playing 14 straight games in California." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago won its 11th straight in Comiskey Park. The game was delayed twice by 
rain for a total of 2 hours, 9 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of a series you walk away shaking your head because you feel 
you let three games get away," Lefebvre said. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago scored two runs in the second. Ivan Calderon and Dan Pasqua hit 
consecutive singles and Calderon scored when second baseman Harold Reynolds 
threw Daryl Boston's grounder into center field. Fred Manrique followed with a 
run-scoring groundout. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Guillen, who extending his hitting streak to 16 games, hit RBI singles in 
the seventh and eighth for a 4-0 lead. His hitting streak is one short of the 
American League season high set by New York's Don Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Davis hit a two-run home run in the eighth off Shawn Hillegas, his ninth 
homer, and Scott Bradley's RBI double pulled Seattle to within 4-3. Harold 
Baines led off with his 13th home run.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: CASTING A SHADOW OF HER OWN NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NORMAN, Okla.

<TEXT>
<P>
Her nickname is "Paws," and a simple handshake proves why. Bev Oden's hands are 
as wide as waffle irons, her fingers as long as licorice sticks. We compare 
digits, and hers extend a full inch or so past mine. No wonder a volleyball 
looks so modest in her hands, as if someone had forgotten to properly inflate 
it. 
</P>
<P>
These are hands destined for greatness, say those who have watched Oden develop 
into the national high school player of the year while at Irvine. These are 
hands bigger than those of her sister Elaina, a two-time volleyball 
All-American at Pacific; and of sister Kim, captain of the 1988 U.S. Olympic 
volleyball team and two-time National Collegiate Athletic Assn. player of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
They are bigger, yet are they better? And isn't that the problem with family 
legacies anyway: the constant comparisons, the unending "Elaina would have done 
this," or "Kim would have done that?" 
</P>
<P>
"People would say, 'She's an Oden, she should be awesome,' " said Joe Sagula, 
head coach of Oden's U.S. Olympic Festival East team. 
</P>
<P>
But that is Oden's fate. It is the penalty of being born into the first family 
(well, maybe second or third) of volleyball. It is also the fine paid for 
choosing the same sport and, to make matters more interesting, the same school 
(Stanford) as the superstar Kim did. 
</P>
<P>
Oden could have gone anywhere. You name the university and Oden probably can 
find the matching letterhead, what with her many stacks of recruiting mail. But 
in the end, there was little doubt that Palo Alto would be her next mailing 
address. In this case, logic triumphed over emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I didn't want to go there because Kim had gone there," she said. "I 
didn't want to have to follow in her footsteps for another four years like I 
did at Irvine. But I got to the point where I decided I should make a decision 
for where I wanted to go, not because my sister was there. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, I'm getting so used to the comparisons, it's not that big of deal to 
me anymore. I think I can handle it for four more years." 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, Oden will have to dodge shadows for the rest of her playing days, 
Stanford or no Stanford. She is too well known, too prominent to slide through 
high-profile competitions, such as the Olympic Festival, as anything other than 
an Oden sister. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I would actually be able to follow in my sisters' footsteps 
when I started volleyball," she said. "I thought I was going to be a mess 
because of all the expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she is on the verge of becoming a star. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-2, Oden certainly has the physical dimensions to make an impact. Less 
predictable is her playing disposition. Opponents, it seems, begin their 
assessments of Oden with, "She can be a really good player, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
But what? This is the player of the year we're talking about here. This is the 
next generation of U.S. volleyball. Isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
"She has the potential to be a dominating force internationally," Sagula said. 
"But she doesn't control the situation yet. She has to say, 'I own this court. 
I own this net.' She doesn't have that personality yet. I haven't seen that 
aggressiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Said Natalie Williams, who has played against Oden, most recently at the 
Olympic Festival: "She's really a timid player." 
</P>
<P>
Picky, picky. After all, there are worse predicaments than to be this good and 
yet, according to those in the know, untapped. As is, Sagula said, Oden could 
exert half the effort on her jumps "and still beat everybody here." And how 
many players have to move away from the net so they can properly hit a kill 
shot? Oden does. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone can light a fire under her, she could be devastating," Sagula said. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Oden half agrees with those who hesitate to call her the best 
thing in volleyball since kneepads. But that's why she's here, she said, to 
better her game, to earn a certain measure of respect. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem was the rigors of a long and demanding high school season. 
Two consecutive state championships don't come without a price. In this case, 
it was Oden's desire that suffered.

"It got tiresome and monotonous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sufficiently recharged, Oden has since grown fond of the game again. A veteran 
of a previous Festival in Raleigh, N.C., Oden said she couldn't wait to play in 
another one. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, she came prepared with a checklist of needed improvements, 
including shot blocking -- "I'm definitely going to have to work on that," she 
said; serving and "conditioning and stuff," which makes you wonder just how she 
won player of the year in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
But then comes a match, in this instance, an earlier meeting between the East 
and West teams. Oden is positioned in front of the net on the right flank. 
There is a pass and then another, this one toward Oden, who adjusts her aim in 
midair and cranks the ball past the arms of two would-be blockers. It is a 
devastating shot, enough to make the proud Oden name shine a little brighter.

SHAREHOLDERS OK SMITHKLINE DEAL SPINNING OFF BECKMAN, ALLERGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newly merged company, SmithKline Beecham, is a prescription and 
over-the-counter drug company with more than $6.7 billion in annual revenues, 
second only to Merck &amp; Co. Its headquarters will be in London with Beecham 
chief executive Robert Bauman retaining that title and SmithKline chief 
executive Henry Wendt shifting to chairman. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the merger, Irvine-based Allergan Inc. and Fullerton-based Beckman 
Instruments Inc., which had been acquired by SmithKline several years ago, were 
spun off as separately traded public companies, severing all ties with the 
pharmaceutical giant. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline Beckman took a small step toward divestiture of its Orange County 
subsidiaries last November when it took 16% of Beckman Instruments public. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Allergan, a maker of eye- and skin-care products, and Beckman 
Instruments, a medical instruments company, immediately joined the roster of 
Orange County's five largest public corporations, according to Newport 
Securities. In 1988, Allergan had earnings of $80 million on revenue of $756 
million, while Beckman Instruments had earnings of $42.5 million on revenue of 
$770 million. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the merger agreement, all of the Beckman and Allergan stock will be 
issued to former SmithKline Beckman shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
About 66.7 million shares of Allergan stock will begin trading today on the New 
York Stock Exchange. In pre-sale agreements with brokers Wednesday, the stock 
was selling for $24.50 a share, according to Allergan spokesperson Jamie 
Trevor. 
</P>
<P>
Today 28.5 million shares of Beckman stock also will become tradable on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Wednesday's spinoff apparently had little influence on 
Beckman investors. At the close of the market, the company's stock was selling 
in light trading for $18.38 a share, up 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Allergan and Beckman executives said Wednesday that although they believe that 
both companies fared well under SmithKline's leadership, they expect that the 
renewed independence will give added incentive to their employees and 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts observed that the strong earnings of both companies no longer 
will be hidden by the overall performance of the much-larger SmithKline Beckman 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Management and other employees of Allergan and Beckman are expected to take 
advantage of opportunities to purchase stock in the new companies by exercising 
stock options and participating in newly established employee stock ownership 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an exciting time for us. A time of recommitment and rebirth," said Gavin 
Herbert, Allergan's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
George Kilmain, Beckman's vice president of finance, said, "It is good for 
employees to identify with Beckman as an entity. They are making the products 
and now they can see how we are doing. You tend to lose your identify as part 
of a larger corporation." 
</P>
<P>
Allergan was founded in 1948 by Gavin Herbert Sr. in a shop above his Los 
Angeles drugstore. It was bought by SmithKline for $259 million in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman Instruments was started in a Pasadena garage in 1935 by Arnold O. 
Beckman. It was purchased by SmithKline in 1982 for $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
SmithKline decided to divest Beckman and Allergan because their business focus 
was considered peripheral for a pharmaceutical house and because SmithKline and 
Beecham wanted to merge as equal partners, said SmithKline spokesman Alan 
Wachter. For the same reasons, he said, Beecham spun off a cosmetics business. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks Beckman and Allergan executives have been on the road touting 
their companies to securities analysts, many of whom had lost touch with the 
companies when they merged into SmithKline Beckman. 
</P>
<P>
Both Beckman and Allergan are considered financially strong by industry 
analysts, particularly Allergan because of that company's continued rapid 
growth and leadership position in a burgeoning industry. 
</P>
<P>
David MacCallum, managing director of Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. in New York, 
said Allergan is "one of a handful of unique pharmaceutical companies that 
identified a niche and developed a dominant position within that niche. I think 
Allergan will continue to grow at a rate significantly faster than the rest of 
the pharmaceutical industry." 
</P>
<P>
John Osgood, a medical analyst for Alex Brown &amp; Sons in Boston, said he 
believes that at Beckman "independence can serve as a bit of revitalization. I 
think it is an attitude more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that one of Beckman's major markets, medical research, currently is 
lagging because of cutbacks in government spending. But he said he expects the 
company's stock to perform well "in the long term."

Newport Pharmaceuticals International Inc. posted net income of $15,000 for the 
second quarter, contrasted with a loss of $1 million for the like period last 
year. Revenue rose 29%, to $9.4 million from $7.3 million. For the six-month 
period, net income totaled $282,000, compared with a year-earlier loss of $1.2 
million. Revenue increased 20%, to $19 million from $15.9 million. The company 
said the increased revenue primarily reflects sales growth in its America's 
Pharmacy Inc., a mail-service prescription pharmacy. Income benefited from an 
extraordinary gain resulting from the company's repurchase of its 10% Senior 
Secured Convertible Notes. Newport Pharmaceuticals is a diversified health care 
company with headquarters in Newport Beach.

2ND-QUARTER DEFICIT CAUSES BULK OF AST'S YEARLY LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

AST Research Inc. reported a $7.5-million loss for its fiscal year, a figure 
softened somewhat by an unexpected $2.5-million fourth-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
The annual loss for the fiscal year ended June 30 is a long slide from the 
$15.1-million profit that the Irvine-based personal computer manufacturer 
earned in fiscal 1988. The fourth-quarter profit, though double what some 
industry analysts had expected, still was down 68% from the $7.7 million earned 
in last year's final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The results for the fourth quarter were above expectations," said Harvey 
Allison, an analyst with the New York brokerage of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street reacted positively as AST's stock closed Wednesday at $8.875 a 
share, up 25 cents from Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
AST's revenue for its fiscal year increased 11% to $457 million this year from 
$413 million last year. Its fourth-quarter revenue fell 9% to $123.5 million 
this year from $136 million in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the company's yearly loss came from a poor second quarter, ended 
Dec. 31, that resulted in an $8.9-million loss and the termination of 70 
workers in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometime last summer capacity exceeded demand, and suddenly there were more 
products than customers," said Harvey Allison, an analyst with Wertheim 
Schroder. 
</P>
<P>
AST has since offered a more advanced personal computer that the company hopes 
will improve sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
"This year the difference is we have a much broader product line," said Bruce 
Edwards, chief financial officer.

CSUN DAY CAMP TURNS YOUNG INTO STUDENTS OF FITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, Gray is a Van Nuys free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Wade is less than 5 feet tall, yet he's preparing for a place as point 
guard on an NBA basketball team. That may not be impossible. Eric is 10 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the last four summers, he has spent a month of mornings at Cal State 
Northridge's Summer Youth Fitness and Sports Camp, a 25-year-old nonprofit, 
coeducational program for 7- to 12-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
The camp isn't designed to turn youngsters into superstars but to provide a 
non-competitive learning environment, said William J. Vincent, director of the 
camp and a CSUN faculty member. Every day, the children rotate through four 
classes on the campus: swimming, which ranges from basic instruction for 
non-swimmers to diving and water safety; gymnastics; games such as 
shuffleboard, jump rope, handball and kick ball; and sports, including 
</P>
<P>
volleyball, basketball and soccer. Badminton, tennis and golf are taught the 
older children. 
</P>
<P>
Staffed by CSUN's Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education faculty and 
community teachers, the camp is committed to teaching those with perceptual 
motor problems or medical disabilities as well as those who already excel in 
sports, Vincent said. Students are recruited through flyers and brochures sent 
to local schools. 
</P>
<P>
The staff focuses on the "total person concept: helping the students learn 
cooperation and social skills and building self-esteem and self-image," Vincent 
said. As soon as children start doing well on the playground -- having the 
motor coordination, strength and skill to play typical games and sports -- they 
feel more self-confident and make friends more easily, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Cratty, program director of the Center for the Improvement of Physical 
Coordination in West Los Angeles and professor of kinesiology at UCLA, said 
there are three types of self-esteem in children: social, intellectual and 
physical ability. 
</P>
<P>
He said studies show that by increasing a child's physical ability, his 
intellectual self-esteem can rise too. Gifted children and those with learning 
disabilities are often what he terms awkward, and the tack to take is to do 
what you can to help them improve their coordination and skill on the 
playground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The CSUN program provides basic assessment as well as coordination and skill 
training, Vincent said. It offers posture analysis with a written evaluation to 
parents, a screening system for such divergences as scoliosis (lateral 
curvature of the spine), knock knee (when the child stands with the knees 
together and the ankles do not meet) and bowlegs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Fitness Test 
</P>
<P>
The camp also administers a national fitness test that checks for 
cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, overall endurance and body fat 
percentage. The results are computer-generated and recorded, and returning 
students can compare their past records each year. Both tests are valuable 
because they are not usually offered in public or private schools, Vincent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most students who attend the camp are from nearby because there is no 
transportation available through the program. At least 50% of the 200 students 
have been in previous years, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Denise Austin, a consultant to the President's Council on Physical 
Education and Sports, a council survey showed that "90% of all children ages 6 
to 12 fail the presidential sports tests. And 90% can't do one chin-up. Only 
one-sixth of all boys who take the test can do 40 sit-ups in one minute, and a 
study in 'The Physician and Sports Medicine Journal' estimated that 15% to 25% 
of U.S. schoolchildren are obese." 
</P>
<P>
Austin said the decrease in physical ability has taken place just since 1974, 
when more rigorous physical education routines were still budgeted in most of 
the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James G. Garrick, an orthopedic surgeon and director of the Center for 
Sports Medicine at St. Francis Memorial Hospital, San Francisco, said, "The 
fitness levels of children and adolescents have been declining for over two 
decades." 
</P>
<P>
The decreased availability of education dollars makes changing physical 
education programs in the schools an unrealistic goal, Garrick said. He favors 
"an enhancement of extra-scholastic youth sports programs and increased 
education and pressure from parents and the medical profession." 
</P>
<P>
As for participants in the CSUN program, Merrill Hardy, professor of physical 
education at CSUN and the swimming teacher at the Youth Fitness and Sports 
Camp, said they are a fairly homogeneous group, but "a lot of parents have 
their kids in the program because they are less fit, less coordinated than 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Hardy does not think that the decrease in children's fitness levels would come 
as a surprise to anyone. Television, videotapes and games have turned them into 
couch potatoes, and physical education has become increasingly a part-time 
elective at most junior and senior high schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Develop Basic Skills 
</P>
<P>
The key in extracurricular programs such as CSUN's is to develop basic movement 
skills in children so they can succeed and truly enjoy athletics and sports, 
beginning at as early an age as possible, Hardy said. "Kids who don't move 
successfully don't tend to exercise," he said. The CSUN camp started, in fact, 
as a demonstration school for elementary school education, an attempt to show 
CSUN students and the community an ideal approach to teaching fitness. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy suggests that "parents look for programs that offer these kinds of 
opportunities for kids, such as the Department of Parks and Recreation programs 
-- at local parks -- and the YMCA." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent warns against signing children up for such sports as T-Ball and soccer 
too quickly. Not only may parents be limiting the range of choices a child may 
make regarding his favorite activities, but the competitive, organized sports 
tend to attract the cream of the crop. Youngsters with motor weakness or the 
need for skill training may be left on the bench, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy recommends that parents limit television to a specific hour of the day, 
and that they suggest or require 30 minutes a day of physical activity. 
"Parents are short-changing their kids if they don't help them find one to two 
things they will really enjoy doing athletically, to have the opportunity to 
succeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing their parents enjoying an activity does more than anything to get kids 
interested in fitness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The camp costs $260 for a one-month session of half-day classes held five 
mornings a week. There is one teacher for every 12 children at the session, 
which is in July. For information about next year's enrollment, call (818) 
885-2661.

BABY BOOMER BINGO; 
</P>
<P>
YOUNGER PLAYERS GRAVITATE TOWARD METHODICAL GAME TO EASE STRESS AND PERHAPS WIN 
POCKET MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
They arrive at the cavernous bingo halls in packs of three and four, talking in 
low tones about inside frames, outside corners and the ultimate -- a blackout. 
But these aren't the studious grandmothers of the past who sat for hours 
playing the game in linoleum-floored social halls. 
</P>
<P>
In increasing numbers, the folks who roar "BINGO!" are under 40 -- sometimes 
not young enough to remember when the church game was played with pinto beans. 
</P>
<P>
"To win the money. That's why I go," said Debbie Machanic, a manicurist who 
began playing last year with co-workers at the Nail Shop in Northridge. "It's 
just like going to Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
Machanic, 32, said bingo provides a break from going to bars or "just sitting 
in a movie -- and it's not that expensive. I come out ahead -- most of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks only old people play," said Tammy Phelps, 31, who works with 
Machanic and began playing when her mother invited her to a game two years ago. 
"It's exciting -- it's the anticipation, when you get down to just one number." 
</P>
<P>
Most bingo hall managers said between 15% and 40% of their crowds, which are 
limited to 350 for each session by a law that goes into effect Aug. 1, consist 
of players under 40. Youthful players have increased in number over the past 
five years, and most are blue-collar workers who try to boost their incomes, 
the managers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternative to Bars 
</P>
<P>
Many younger players said the game provides a less hectic alternative to 
singles bars and parties, although most concentrate too much on the game to 
actively look for dates. Others like the game's gambling aspect, and some 
became regulars after Mom invited them along one Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go and play bingo and spend what you spend in a bar or theater," said 
Steve Montgomery, co-owner and editor of Bingo Bugle, begun six years ago in 
Sun Valley as a newspaper for enthusiasts. The paper lists games and runs 
columns such as "Dear Aunt Bingo" and "Bingo by the Stars." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of younger people stop off on their way home from work. When the 
freeways are packed, they'll stop and play a game until the traffic dies down," 
Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
"They take it very seriously," said Sam Potter, manager of Lankershim Bingo in 
North Hollywood, managed by Big Brothers of Greater Los Angeles and CRI-HELP, a 
North Hollywood treatment center for drug abusers. Potter said he noticed more 
younger players at the games as recently as three years ago. "Maybe a third of 
the crowd is under 40, but we get people of all ages, starting at 18 years." 
</P>
<P>
There are about 40 bingo halls in the San Fernando Valley, where players are 
given colored sheets of paper containing from one to six bingo faces or 
squares. To win, each square must be blocked out in winning patterns such as 
diagonal rows, four corners, crosses or Xs. 
</P>
<P>
Younger players say the methodical, nearly Zen-like feel of the game, produced 
as players fiercely concentrate on cards while bingo numbers resound through 
hushed halls, is what keeps them coming back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stressed Out' 
</P>
<P>
"I play to calm my nerves," said Mary Rocco, 28, who lives in North Hollywood 
and began playing with her parents a decade ago. "When I'm stressed out, I play 
bingo. I just concentrate on the numbers and winning. It sort of clears my 
mind. But I haven't won in two years -- a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Rocco, who works as a bartender, said she finds little time to socialize at the 
halls. "Your mind is just on the numbers and trying to win. It's pretty much an 
individual game." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Amaral began playing three years ago when a female friend invited him to a 
game. "When I heard you could win $250, that just put dollar signs in my eyes," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Amaral, 34, who works as a shipping and receiving supervisor, said he wins 
about $500 a month from sessions played twice each week. "So far this year, I 
figure I'm ahead by about $343. I've met a lot of friends through bingo. I've 
met girls at games, but I haven't gotten personally involved -- not yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do anything else. Without bingo, I'm not having fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Single Women 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Cassady, 34, has met "several very nice young women at bingo." Cassady, 
who works as a printer, began playing two years ago when his mother introduced 
him to Lankershim Bingo. "Some of the women are married or have steady 
boyfriends, but there are a lot of single women there. We make arrangements to 
meet at the hall and then go out to eat afterward down the block." 
</P>
<P>
To either side of Cassady, fellow players sat at long rows of Formica tables, 
hunched over cards they scanned with fluorescent markers. Several younger men, 
who wore ties and cowboy boots, were scattered among pastel leisure suits worn 
by older players. Some munched on ham sandwiches and chips sold at the "Bingo 
Buffet" and read snatches from popular novels between games. Others caught 
glimpses of sports on portable TVs or listened to the action through radio 
earphones. 
</P>
<P>
Arranged in front of many players were talismans in the form of miniature 
plastic statues of Garfield, Buddha and a few California Raisins. Older players 
favored teddy bears, horseshoes -- even a Bible opened to the book of 
Revelation. Some fingered rosary beads while others meditated or said quick 
prayers while fingering holy cards of St. Jude. 
</P>
<P>
Four older women huddled over a trough of macaroni and cheese at the "Bingo 
Buffet" near the rear of the Lankershim Bingo hall, chatting about "lousy 
cards," "long dry spells," and "I needed a 'G-57' in the last game, not this 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Some younger players kept to themselves and sat in groups discussing favorite 
talismans, such as squares of plastic used to magnify desired numbers on cards. 
</P>
<P>
Bingo was legalized in 1976 by an amendment to the state Constitution and in 
1977, United Cerebral Palsy opened the state's first bingo hall in Van Nuys. 
Church games doling out $25 to $50 in prize money were illegal before 1977, 
although the games were widespread and common. State law now limits prize money 
to $250 per game with a limit of 40 games per session. Proceeds from bingo must 
be donated to charity, and most halls charge from $10 to $25 for sessions 
consisting of from 15 to 40 games. 
</P>
<P>
Indian bingo, played on Indian reservations throughout the country, has also 
become increasingly popular among younger players. The game doles out larger 
prize amounts, usually from $1,000 to $2,000 per game, since reservations are 
exempt from state regulations that apply to other bingo halls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Energy in the Air 
</P>
<P>
"There's more energy in the air," said Mark Sammon, general manager of San 
Manuel Indian Bingo, played on the San Manuel Indian Reservation in San 
Bernardino, the nearest Indian bingo hall to the Valley. "Maybe it has to do 
with the amount of money on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Sammon said his games award about $500,000 per week and attract 2,500 people 
per game, most of whom are shuttled in free by Indian bingo halls from outlying 
areas, including all communities in the Valley. Sammon estimates 30% of his 
players are under 40. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest draw for younger players of the Indian bingo circuit is 
"Megabingo," played via satellite in 14 bingo halls across the country for $5 a 
game. The first person to fill up the "B" row on their cards in each hall wins 
$1,000. The game then progresses until a player blacks out his entire card, 
netting $500,000 should he complete the task before 50 numbers are called. 
</P>
<P>
"This is attracting people who have never played before," said Jack Salinger, 
general manager of Morongo Bingo, which features Megabingo during most sessions 
played on the Morongo Indian Reservation in Cabazon. "Husbands can now go play 
bingo and win more than they would playing poker. That's helping draw new 
crowds at local games too." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Sunshine began playing Indian bingo eight months ago when some friends 
invited her to a game. She has since won about $2,200. 
</P>
<P>
"Once people hear of a game that pays out $100,000, I think there's an element 
of excitement," said Sunshine, 36, who lives in Woodland Hills and works as an 
administrator for a computer firm. "It's a new adventure for people who have 
never played before. You go one time and you get hooked." 
</P>
<P>
Many say the chance aspect of the game keeps them returning to bingo halls week 
after week. "To me, it's addicting, it's like gambling," Lynn Messine, 26, said 
as she ripped off a sheet of bingo games and poised her marker for a new game 
at Lankershim Bingo. "I go three or four times a week and I win constantly." 
Messine, who cares for her three children full time in Sunland, said she wins 
about $500 per month. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't won in two years," said her mother, Carol Krueger, 50, a Sun Valley 
waitress who introduced her two daughters to the game seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For some older patrons, the game has been a lifelong pursuit. "Right now it's 
the only recreation I have," said Nora Nolter, 75, a former secretary who has 
been playing for 50 years and now lives in Panorama City. "If they ever stop 
bingo, I'd be very unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've noticed more younger people coming in. They're a lot more lucky. And more 
men too, but they should stay home and watch the kids -- leave bingo to the 
women." 
</P>
<P>
Other players claim that the game provides a form of exercise, a sort of 
"aerobic bingo," according to Cassady. "I personally think bingo is good for 
your circulatory system," he said. "When you get close to winning, you get 
excited and your heart rate increases. It's a real adrenaline rush."

Legendary director Cecil B. DeMille would be proud of the way his house looks 
today, thanks in no small part to the efforts (and expenditures) of Marsha 
Broderick. She is owner of Pink Ladies Design in Calabasas and president of the 
San Fernando Valley chapter of the International Society of Interior Designers. 
Along with the Los Angeles chapter of the society, the Valley group completely 
redecorated the privately owned DeMille mansion in the Los Feliz neighborhood 
for their 1989 Design Showcase House. 
</P>
<P>
About 23 designers participated, each decorating a particular room that was 
named after a Hollywood legend. Broderick was assigned the living room, also 
known as the DeMille room. Like DeMille's work, the room is grand. 
</P>
<P>
"Its contents are insured for $150,000," Broderick notes. In addition to custom 
furniture and antiques, the room contains a trophy-size stuffed lion (one of 
DeMille's favorite animals), the tablet of the Ten Commandments and the golden 
calf featured in his film "The Ten Commandments," and his two Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
"As is typical with a design house, the designers receive donations from all 
their suppliers," Broderick says. "Over and above that, though, are the 
additional costs of things that weren't donated, as well as delivery costs, 
office staff time, etc." She looks at her expenses as a form of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Not counting office time, Broderick says she spent about $8,000 out of her own 
pocket to decorate the room. The lucky owners of the mansion -- Terry and 
Evelyn O'Toole -- get to keep everything that isn't nailed down: wallpaper, 
carpeting, window coverings, custom doors and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
The rest is for sale to the public, with proceeds going to the San Fernando 
Valley unit of the American Cancer Society. The house is open for tours until 
July 30. Call (818) 989-5555 for information.

Best Sellers 
</P>
<P>
Slippers have moved beyond calfskin flip-flops for men and pastel fur balls for 
women. Too boring. Slippers are now a new frontier for humor. 
</P>
<P>
Take the $30 political slippers, for example. They resemble beds. Popping out 
of the toes on one slipper is the plastic face of George Bush, with Barbara in 
her simulated pearls snuggling out of your other slipper. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't like beating around in the Bushes, you can slip into the Reagans 
(with a grotesquely smiling Nancy), or try on the Gorbachevs, or pad about with 
Charles and Di. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bushes are the most popular, followed by the Reagans," notes Wenc Ramirez, 
a salesman at Bullock's in Sherman Oaks Fashion Square. "The Gorbachevs and 
Charles and Diana are the least popular." (The slippers are also available at 
Rocs of Valencia in Valencia.) 
</P>
<P>
For those who prefer plain animals over the political variety, an assortment of 
critter-slippers is available for $19.95 at L.A. Wildlife in Studio City. At 
the moment, it's a tossup whether the cow or the moose slipper is the top 
seller, but the horse is out of the race.

Picture This Vacation 
</P>
<P>
Forget about asking a travel agent to name the hot vacation spots this summer. 
Your local photo developer is probably just as knowledgeable about where people 
go for R&amp;R. 
</P>
<P>
"The most popular vacation spot is Hawaii," says Marina Nishikawa of Just One 
Hour in Panorama Mall. A number of other photo developers agree. 
</P>
<P>
"You just know it's Hawaii because everybody shoots the same pictures: hula 
dancers, the water, the beach, the palm trees and sunsets," says Mary Ann 
Balbier, co-owner of Marks Color Lab in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"They usually get carried away on the sunset pictures," notes Tina Su, who runs 
her family's Better Image One-Hour Photo in Sherman Oaks. "They just keep on 
snapping. They all look kind of the same after a while -- maybe the color is 
brighter in some." 
</P>
<P>
A vacation in Hawaii typically results in five to seven rolls of film, the 
developers report. "I think they actually could cut it down to about half of 
that," Su says. 
</P>
<P>
Another popular destination this summer is Europe. "They're always more 
paranoid about their film from Europe than Hawaii," Balbier says. "They tell us 
to be real careful, like we're going to say, 'Oh, this is Europe? Then let's 
stomp on it!' " 
</P>
<P>
Does it get a little boring seeing roll after roll of the same Hawaiian scenes? 
</P>
<P>
"I would never go to Hawaii," Balbier admits. "Because of all the pictures I've 
seen of it, I wouldn't bother." 
</P>
<P>
Bridesmaids' Fashions 
</P>
<P>
Think of a bridesmaid and you picture a woman in gauzy pastel pink, yellow or 
blue. You think of wedding guests making snide comments about puffed sleeves or 
empire waists or too much lace. "She'll never be able to wear that dress any 
place else," someone whispers. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to widen your vision. Bridesmaids are abandoning tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"We're selling more cotton fabrics with floral prints for bridesmaids' 
dresses," notes Joy Tamblyn, owner of Wedding Wizard in Simi Valley. "It's more 
of an informal look with cotton, and it works well with smaller weddings, where 
the bride wants it to look like a wedding party but not be overdone." 
</P>
<P>
Bridesmaids like the long cotton gowns because they can be shortened after the 
ceremony for use as summer dresses, she says. "The floral prints are 
predominantly in pastel colors, but it's a mixture of colors, like pinks and 
ivories and sky blue." 
</P>
<P>
Other bridal emporiums report a trend toward more sophisticated and formal 
attire. "We're doing a lot of black-and-white weddings in which the bridesmaids 
wear a white dress, or a black one, or a black-and-white combination. This is 
the most formal look you can get," observes the owner of Bridal Images in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I've even had several European brides come in and ask for black wedding gowns, 
but I don't carry any," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
At Country Elegance in Toluca Lake, manager Lois Higgins reported that sheer 
lace blouses (a camisole is worn underneath) and lace skirts are a popular 
combination for bridesmaids. "They might not wear that combination together 
again but they will wear one or the other," Higgins says.

EVEN BOLSHOI FARM TEAM SOWS MAGIC 
</P>

<P>
The dancers were only the farm team for the prestigious Bolshoi Ballet. The 
choreography was conservative. But the mystique that surrounds one of the 
world's leading bastions of dance worked its magic on San Diego balletomanes 
Tuesday night when the Bolshoi Ballet Academy made its local debut at the Civic 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as "65 stars of today and tomorrow," the group of students and recent 
alumni of the Bolshoi's 200-year-old school were well-drilled and eager to 
please as they gave the first of seven performances in town. And, despite their 
youth (some of the dancers are only 16), they displayed a stage presence and 
amplitude of attack that glossed over many of the rough spots in the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the school's emphasis on the classics, Tuesday's performance 
included excerpts from some of the oldest balletic masterworks in the popular 
repertory. Unfortunately, it was impossible to rely on the program distributed 
by the ushers or the slick souvenir version sold in the lobby to follow the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokeswoman blamed the botched programs on a clerical error, but that 
did not explain why there were no pre-curtain announcements to signal the 
changes or credit the replacements in the cast. 
</P>
<P>
The classic showpieces of the evening were the second act of "Swan Lake" 
(1895), excerpts from "La Fille Mal Gardee" (1789), a fleeting solo from 
"Coppelia" (1870) and "Le Corsaire" pas de deux (1899). Most of these crowd 
pleasers will be recycled during at least two of the three separate programs 
scheduled for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Some 20th-Century repertory works showed up along with the old war horses on 
the eight-piece program, but they hardly qualified as contemporary: "Adagio," 
an ensemble work by the group's longtime director, Madame Sofia Golovkina, and 
"Narcissus," the solo recently turned over to Vladimir Malakhov (the sensation 
of the Moscow Classical Ballet during its stint in Boston last year and a gold 
medalist at the Moscow International Ballet Competition in June) were on the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of rising stars are among the ranks of the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, 
including Michael Shannon, 19, of Los Angeles, who talked his way into a spot 
in the celebrated Soviet school. Although Shannon was expected to be partner to 
Galina Stepanyenko, 21, (another gold medalist at the Moscow competition) in 
the "Le Corsaire" pas de deux at Tuesday's performance, his only appearance was 
in a brief solo spot from "Coppelia." 
</P>
<P>
Shannon burst on stage with gusto as Franz, displaying the kind of performing 
brio and physical abandon that have become hallmarks of Soviet ballet. The only 
American in the troupe proved quite convincingly that classical dancing prowess 
and a bravura presence are not exclusively Russian traits. 
</P>
<P>
The real superstar in the company, however, is Malakhov. This 22-year-old 
wunderkind has already reached world-class stature, and he flaunted that star 
quality in the pas de deux from "Flower Festival at Genzano." His easy 
elevations, virtuosic turns in the air, long leaps and general buoyancy in the 
sunny phrases of the Bournonville classic evoked a well-deserved chorus of 
bravos. 
</P>
<P>
Malakhov's solo, "Narcissus," was more introspective (evoking shades of 
Nijinsky's "Faun") and less of a showcase for his sheer bravado. But the 
charismatic performer kept the audience entranced with small nuances, such as 
the flick of his head as he sleeked the movements. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest rafter raiser of the evening was "Septet," a dance that abounds 
with invigorating macho moves and breathtaking pyrotechnics. Danced to 
Ukrainian folk music, the flamboyant folk dance -- performed in blazing 
Cossack-style costumes -- sent the fleet-footed dancers into a series of 
gravity-defying jumps and those punishing squat kicks rarely seen on American 
stages. "Septet" was buried in the middle of the program, but it was the hit of 
the evening with the first-nighters. 
</P>
<P>
The best corps dancing was seen in the clockwork precision of "Swan Lake." 
Stepanyenko (a dancer with the Stanislavsky Theatre Ballet) stole the spotlight 
as Odette. The frightened, bird-like flutter of her expressive ports de bras 
and those deep back bends lifted her performance well above the average. She 
was impressive in "Le Corsaire" as well, partnered with the dynamic (but sadly 
uncredited) Bolshoi Ballet soloist Yuri Klevtsov. 
</P>
<P>
Klevtsov made quick work of the dazzling feats of virtuosity Marius Petipa 
designed for the bare-chested spectacle, but he was replaced in the closing 
work (excerpts from "La Fille Mal Gardee") by Aleksei Musatov. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ekaterina Besergani was a standout in the cast of "Adagio," there was 
nothing memorable about the choreography. Besergani will get a better shot at 
the limelight when she alternates with Stepanyenko in "Swan Lake" at subsequent 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
There was no shortage of kitsch in Tuesday's mixed bag. Heading the list was 
the hyperactive "Sabre Dance." Aram Khachaturian's lightning-quick score 
whipped the saber-wielding dancers into such a frenzy that they could hardly 
maintain their equilibrium, but the audience was not taken in by its fury. 
</P>
<P>
There was no live music, and the taped accompaniment to many of the dances was 
scratchy and over-amplified, but the lavish costumes and decor for "Swan Lake" 
were up to traditional standards. 
</P>
<P>
The Bolshoi Ballet Academy will continue its run at the Civic Theatre tonight 
through Saturday at 8 o'clock, with weekend matinees (Saturday at 2 p.m. and 
Sunday at 3). The programs will feature Alexander Gorsky's version of 
"Coppelia" (Act III), "The Girl and the Deer," "Sleeping Beauty's" bluebird pas 
de deux, "Spring Waters," the Grand Pas from "Don Quixote," Act III of "Swan 
Lake" and other repertory pieces.

<P>
JACOBSEN TO DEMONSTRATE TRANSCRIPTION TECHNIQUE TONIGHT AT CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an age preoccupied with performing music on old "authentic" instruments, 
Jared Jacobsen is trying to restore the once-popular practice of playing 
transcriptions on huge pipe organs. 
</P>
<P>
"Organ transcriptions engage audiences immediately," Jacobsen said in a phone 
interview from New York, where he is participating in the Chautauqua 
Institution Summer School of Music. "People used to do (transcriptions of) 
everything for everything else. If you heard a Wagner Overture that nobody else 
had heard, you rearranged and took it out on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"The art of the organ transcription was very popular until maybe the end of the 
'40s. Then it sort of died out. With the rise of the authentic performance 
practice movement and the neoclassic and neo-Baroque organ-building movement, 
people were no longer being taught to do transcriptions. And there are few 
instruments on which we can work. But a few of us are popularizing them again. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is not to make the work sound exactly like it did on the original 
instrument but to give it life as an organ piece. It helps if the organ has a 
lot of flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen, 40, will offer a program entirely of transcriptions -- ranging from 
Bach's organ setting of Vivaldi's Concerto in A minor for Two Violins to 
Jacobsen's own account of Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" -- on Friday 
at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Making a transcription isn't an easy task, according to the organist. "Most 
keyboard transcriptions require a lot of piano technique to make them work 
right," he said. "They are much more difficult than most original works for the 
organ. 
</P>
<P>
"Oftentimes, transcribing from the original -- if the original was for large 
orchestra, as in the case of Stravinsky's 'Firebird' or something that requires 
a lot of people playing -- you have to enhance the music with sort of wild runs 
and arpeggios, chromatic scales, big chords, various acoustical devices to make 
the music fill out properly." 
</P>
<P>
As difficult as it can be to get the transcription to maintain the integrity of 
the original composition, Jacobsen said, it is nearly as important to match 
repertory and venue. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the challenges when you play at the Crystal Cathedral is not to clobber 
the audience with every single piece," he said. "Part of the fun will be 
playing the room as much as the organ. To get the right acoustic effect is to 
get the room ringing with the music. Playing with the sound and the silence. 
It's not a matter of pushing down the notes, which is hard enough, but 
listening to what is happening in the room." 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason he was eager to play at the Crystal Cathedral when the 
invitation came from his "longtime" friend, Frederick Swann, director of music 
and organist at the Garden Grove facility. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to almost all of the major recitals there since the organ has been 
finished," he said. "I have an idea of what works there and what doesn't. For 
some things, I will try to make really exotic sounds to make these pieces come 
to life. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that the organ really sounds quite good . . . at the 
console. Lately, I've been playing at the Washington Cathedral. I would not be 
able to do these pieces there because much of the organ is (placed) way over 
your head or around the corner. At the Crystal Cathedral, what you're hearing 
there is what the audience is getting." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen said an organ in a glass building such as the Crystal Cathedral "ought 
not to work as well as it does." 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason it works is that the organ is a couple of stories above the 
heads of the audience," he explained. "Then, there are dramatic trumpets at the 
corners, which set sounds spinning around the audience's heads. That is an 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an ideal organ for cute, little Bach Trio Sonatas, but it's perfect 
for (Mussorgsky's) 'Old Castle' or 'Baba-Yaga' shrieking through the air and 
terrorizing villages on her broom. You can get those kinds of effects because 
of the acoustic in that building. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"When you get to play for the Crystal Cathedral, you have to find the perfect 
program," he said. "That's the right instrument to do the 'Pictures.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mussorgsky's music has been transcribed for orchestra in different versions by 
Ravel and Stokowski. 
</P>
<P>
But why organ? 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, various organ versions have been done by people in Europe," 
Jacobsen said. "I was convinced that someone would do them here, but nobody 
has, not until now. 
</P>
<P>
"It turns out that the work translates very easily into an organ piece. The 
appeal of the piece is in color and image and not so much in actual 
keyboard-writing. For my version, I have purposefully not listened to anybody 
else's orchestration. I'm working strictly from the piano score -- what 
pictures the piano music suggests to me and going after that sound on the 
organ." 
</P>
<P>
For Jacobsen, the foot pedals and the multiple manuals of an organ offer a 
distinct advantage in Mussorgsky's score. 
</P>
<P>
"In many of the movements, the piano version really stretches what you can do 
with 10 fingers. But if you can play the bass line or two lines with the feet, 
that frees the hands to do things on top. It works out better. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm almost convinced -- if I didn't know better -- that Mussorgsky had the 
organ in mind when he wrote it. It works so well. I've had to make very few 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
Only one part of the score gave him problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The movement I had to do the most creative readjusting was the last one, 'The 
Great Gate of Kiev,' " he said. "In the piano version, I think that's the 
weakest movement of all. Unless you have enormous strength or a huge piano, it 
doesn't have the huge, sonic impact it needs. So I had to fill out chords and 
add some pianistic, organistic things." 
</P>
<P>
 Organist Jared Jacobsen will play transcriptions of works by Mussorgsky, 
Stravinsky, Prokofiev and others at 8:15 tonight at the Crystal Cathedral, 
12141 Lewis St, Garden Grove. Tickets: $6. Information: (714) 971-4017.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: DEVO WILL PERFORM IN FIRST BENEFIT CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are they not (charitable) men? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, says Jerry Casale, co-founder of Devo, is that the veteran new-wave 
band has long wanted to rock for a good cause. But somehow, from its debut in 
1978 until the present, Devo never has played a benefit concert. 
</P>
<P>
That will change Labor Day weekend, when Devo headlines the two-day Ocean Aid 
concert at Irvine Bowl in Laguna Beach. Proceeds from the Sept. 3 and 4 benefit 
will go to environmental groups dedicated to safeguarding Southern California's 
shores and coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never asked to play a benefit when we were enjoying enough commercial 
success" to be a major draw, Casale said this week from the North Hollywood 
rehearsal studio where Devo is writing songs for its next album. By the time 
big rock benefits like the Amnesty International tour began to roll around, 
Devo was no longer the mass attraction that would put it on a benefit 
organizer's A list. "We wanted very much to play and we asked to, but we 
weren't a big enough fish to fry," Casale said. 
</P>
<P>
So when the organizers of Ocean Aid called last month, Devo quickly agreed to 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface of it, an idealistic gesture such as playing an environmental 
benefit might seem anomalous for Devo. This is the band, after all, that posed 
the musical question, "Are we not men?" and answered with its own jaundiced, 
satiric theory of De-evolution, which held, in essence, that mankind isn't 
evolving, but regressing on its way to hell in a handbasket. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't actually celebrating it," Casale said of Devo's dismal view of 
human nature. "We were more freaked out by it. We've never just complained. 
We've always offered ideas and solutions in interviews and elsewhere. I'm 
unfortunately afraid that we were right pretty much. The world is Devo. 
Everything is very, very critical." 
</P>
<P>
While Devo hasn't been a big draw nationally since the early '80s, the band has 
a strong base in Orange County, where it sold out nine performances last 
December and January at the Coach House -- more than 3,400 tickets. Total 
capacity for the two Ocean Aid shows is 5,000. Besides Devo, the lineup for the 
benefit features San Diego techno-pop band Red Flag; Caterwaul, a 
self-descriptively named I.R.S. Records act from Los Angeles; and the Dr. Dream 
Team: a cadre of acts signed to locally based Dr. Dream Records that includes 
Oingo Boingo offshoot Food For Feet and three Orange County bands -- Eggplant, 
Swamp Zombies and Imagining Yellow Suns. Tickets, priced from $18 to $22.50, go 
on sale July 31. 
</P>
<P>
Casale said the shows may give Devo fans a preview of some of the songs that 
will wind up on the band's next album. After last year's dance-pop oriented 
comeback album, "Total Devo," Casale sees the new material sounding "more like 
primitive early Devo. We wanted to get back to something more essential, less 
Baroque and ornate. I think too many machines entered Devo's life." Next time 
around, Casale said, the sound will emphasize more guitars, "and real drums." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Pacific Sunwear Ltd., the Tustin-based company that sponsors the annual 
Op Pro Surfing Championship in Huntington Beach, is the prime mover and 
financial backer behind Ocean Aid. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in our office are in the water every day as surfers. We see 
first hand what's happening to the ocean" said Jerry Crosby, executive vice 
president of Ocean Pacific and organizer of the Ocean Aid Foundation, formed to 
distribute funds from the benefit to area environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby's goal is to raise $40,000 to $50,000 at this year's benefit, with an 
eye toward expanding Ocean Aid's scope in future years. The benefit will be 
promoted heavily next week at Op Pro, which is expected to draw more than 
100,000 spectators.

SEARCH FOR SPIRITUALITY STALLS IN ABSTRACTIONS, LOUD INTENSITY

<P>
The Call and its leader, Michael Been, are trying to accomplish something 
uncommonly ambitious with rock. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing from a Christian Everyman perspective (as opposed to the 
prophet/messiah pose of a Bono Hewson), Been explores some of the deepest, most 
thought-provoking issues of religious belief and spirituality. The Call's 
undogmatic songs are about yearning for connection with the divine and 
suffering doubts that one's store of faith and righteousness aren't sufficient. 
Belief, for Been, confers the hopefulness that allows one to keep on striving 
for a sense of grace -- even while realizing that grace is ephemeral, and gives 
way inevitably to a new cycle of doubt and near-despair. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, evident from the Call's show Tuesday night at the Coach House in 
San Juan Capistrano, is that it is tackling the biggest subject of all with a 
relatively limited expressive range. Whether playing an uplifting anthem, a 
yearning hymn, or a dark and stormy song about failures or quests, Been and 
company went for big drama and big dynamics in their music. Been's lyrics, 
meanwhile, were full of broad concepts, symbols and abstractions. 
</P>
<P>
Missing was the storytelling ability that one finds in the work of rock's best 
spiritually oriented songwriters (such as Bob Dylan, Robbie Robertson and Van 
Morrison), and in the Bible itself. In his quest for The Word, Been fails to 
deploy humbler words, strung together in a tale, that might bring ultimate 
concepts down to earth and into more involving focus. 
</P>
<P>
An earthier kind of music-making also could help. The Call's 90-minute set was 
well executed (although the band rarely added anything new to recorded versions 
of songs), and Been's singing was strong and dramatic without lapsing into 
bombast. But the show's constant grand scale, even in the quieter, hymnal 
numbers, led to a sense of sameness. 
</P>
<P>
By now, Tracy Chapman and Cowboy Junkies have made the pop world safe for a 
quieter, more intimate kind of intensity. The Call would do well to explore it 
and to keep in mind that an album like Dylan's "John Wesley Harding," the 
standard-setter for spiritual exploration in rock, was built around playing 
that was humble and folksy. It also had its moments of humor, something that, 
unfortunately, appears to be beyond the Call's ken. 
</P>
<P>
While the stocky, bearded Been looked approachable in his jeans and untucked 
shirt, he turned out to be remote. Yes, the music speaks for itself, but it's 
only natural for a listener to want to hear some talk between songs, in order 
to connect a bit more closely to the spiritual searcher on stage. Been confined 
himself to an occasional "thank you very much" between songs and a "God bless 
you" at the end. 
</P>
<P>
The show had its highlights, notably the celebratory "Let the Day Begin." The 
full-house audience was obviously enraptured by most of what the Call played. 
It was a solid-enough performance, but solid is a disappointment when the 
music's goal is to bring spiritual experience to life.

POTATO SALADS; 
</P>
<P>
THE ADDITION OF WINE VINEGARS, CRAB MEAT, APPLES, DILL WEED, CUMIN AND YOGURT 
ENLIVEN A CLASSIC AMERICAN SUMMER SIDE DISH.

<P>
Why fuss with a good thing? To make it better, that's why, or just for a 
change. These are the only reasons for tampering with an American classic such 
as potato salad. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipes employ such innovations as shrimp, yogurt, cumin seeds, 
apples and brown sugar. They veer a long way from tradition, judging by a 
recipe that appeared in the old "Household Searchlight Recipe Book." This book 
was first published in Kansas in 1931. In that era, potato salad required only 
potatoes, sweet cucumber pickles, onion, hard-cooked eggs and mayonnaise or 
boiled dressing. 
</P>
<P>
Such simple mixtures so pleased the American palate that, throughout the years, 
annual potato salad consumption has risen to 286 million pounds. This figure 
was issued by CPC International Inc., parent company of Best Foods, and was 
based on data from a market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
A prime candidate to increase the yearly consumption is the Country Potato 
Salad prepared at Julienne, a bistro in San Marino. Susan Campoy, who owns this 
restaurant and take-out business, combines unpeeled small red potatoes with 
bacon, celery and green onions. The dressing consists of mayonnaise flavored 
with bacon drippings, red wine vinegar, brown sugar and Dijon mustard. 
</P>
<P>
Carola Drew of Los Angeles is from Berlin, and the recipe she uses originated 
with her mother. That makes it genuinely German as opposed to American-style 
German potato salad, which is served warm and includes bacon and vinegar. Drew 
adds tart apples to the potatoes and enhances the tang with wine vinegar and 
lemon juice. The salad is served chilled. "It's fine for picnics and 
barbecues," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Burkholder's Dijon Potato Salad is a classic for the '80s, lending 
itself to such variations as the addition of bacon, dill pickles, cornichons or 
fresh dill. The unusual aspect is its track record. Burkholder, sous-chef at 
the Hyatt Grand Champions Resort at Indian Wells, went to China in 1988 to 
teach American cooking methods to Chinese food service personnel. This is one 
of the recipes that went with her. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, mayonnaise was not available in China, so we had to make our own," 
said Burkholder. "The only disadvantage to this was that in China there is no 
good-quality oil. We had to use rapeseed oil, which has a very strong flavor." 
</P>
<P>
The addition of cumin, mustard seeds and yogurt indicates Indian influence. And 
the salad that contains these ingredients was developed by actress Madhur 
Jaffrey, well known for her Indian cookbooks and television cook show 
appearances. The recipe title, The Best, Lightest Potato Salad, tells the 
salad's virtues. The recipe appears in "Madhur Jaffrey's Cookbook: Easy 
East/West Menus for Family and Friends," published by Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
<P>
In Hawaii, the accepted style of potato salad includes shrimp or crab meat, 
peas and grated carrot. It's also typical to add macaroni. Mushrooms are 
featured in a salad that was designed for a new, buttery tasting yellow potato 
from Michigan called Huston's Yukon Gold. Dijon mustard and tarragon flavor the 
dressing, and the salad is topped with chopped nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Bevelaqua of Muttontown, N.Y., cuts the calories in her salad by using 
low-fat yogurt and reduced-calorie mayonnaise. The recipe won first prize in a 
potato salad contest sponsored by Best Foods mayonnaise and Woman's Day 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The final salad comes in an edible container, a tomato cup. It's another 
calorie-conscious dish, employing low-fat cottage cheese instead of mayonnaise.

ABOUT WINE: POLISHING OFF THE TARNISHED IMAGE OF RIESLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The question arose during the World Vinifera Conference here, which focused on 
the Riesling grape as it grows around the world: 
</P>
<P>
If the greatest Rieslings of Germany are sweet wines, and if vintage charts of 
German Riesling reflect the quality of the sweet wines and not the dry ones, 
how do wine producers convince the public that dry Riesling is a great 
experience when it is matched with food? 
</P>
<P>
Riesling's tarnished image was the focus of the three-day conference here last 
week, an event in which 200 participants ran through a series of luncheons and 
dinners pairing dry Rieslings with food and through half a dozen tasting 
sessions comparing the dry and off-dry Rieslings of many regions of the world. 
Through it all, they heard major wine authorities talk of the Riesling Problem. 
</P>
<P>
This first World Vinifera Conference, sponsored by the Washington Wine 
Institute, was inaugurated, in part, because of slow sales of Riesling -- both 
sweet and dry -- in the United States. And since Washington makes some of the 
best Rieslings in the United States, that state's industry leaders were eager 
to find out if a solution to the Riesling Problem was simply missing the 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Grand Match 
</P>
<P>
What they found out, and what they had suspected all along, is that dry 
Riesling is indeed a grand match for many types of food, but that even the 
Germans, who have a long and proud tradition of making Rieslings both dry and 
sweet, have been having a devil of a time getting folks to buy the same 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
Only in Australia, it was learned, does Riesling sell rather well -- about 50% 
of all fine wine sales Down Under are of Rieslings, said Brian Croser, one of 
Australia's great wine makers. 
</P>
<P>
The Riesling Problem exists, many speakers agreed, because of at least two 
major symptoms that have grown up in the last few decades to change the 
public's view of Riesling. 
</P>
<P>
One is the rash of sweeter Rieslings that have been made around the world that 
are (a) not classic dessert style wines such as the famed auslesen and 
beerenauslesen of Germany, and (b) too sweet to match with food. These are the 
in-between wines that have 2% to 4% residual sugar and that may be fine as a 
hot-day aperitif but that would dominate most seafood dishes. 
</P>
<P>
A second symptom is wine that has no relation to Riesling -- true Riesling. 
These imposters have been lurking in the shadows of the wine industry for 
decades, playing off of Riesling's great name the way bad actors eke out a 
living by mimicking great performers. 
</P>
<P>
Among these are such wines as Grey Riesling (which is actually Trousseau Gris 
or Chauche Gris and has no Riesling heritage whatever); Franken Riesling (which 
is actually the low-aroma Sylvaner in disguise), and the proprietary-designated 
Monterey Riesling that Mirassou has popularized and that has very little true 
Riesling. 
</P>
<P>
Other countries have confused the issue even more, with Italy putting out a 
Riesling Italico, with Hungary marketing an Olaszriesling and Yugoslavia 
offering Laskiriesling. All of these wines are made from the little-regarded 
Welschriesling grape, which has virtually no Riesling character in either aroma 
or taste. 
</P>
<P>
In South Africa a wine called Cape Riesling, and in Australia a wine called 
Clare Riesling, both are made from the Cruchen Blanc grape, again with no 
Riesling parentage. 
</P>
<P>
As if that weren't enough, because of inability to market its superb Semillons 
some years ago, Australians began marketing Semillons as Hunter Riesling. 
</P>
<P>
(A sad fact is that these most exceptional wines, many on a par with the finest 
White Graves of Bordeaux, were so poorly named that when they first came into 
the United States in the 1970s, Americans thought the wines were from the 
Riesling grape. Finding the wines different, we ignored them. Happily, few 
Semillons from Australia today carry the Hunter Riesling name any more and the 
wines are some of Australia's best.) 
</P>
<P>
Then add in the fact that in the United States, by strange federal edict, it's 
permissible to call the classic Riesling wine "Johannisberg Riesling" or "White 
Riesling," but not, curiously enough, Riesling. 
</P>
<P>
All this confusion about Riesling was the focal point of the three-day 
conference here. One conclusion was that the consumer does not now have any 
inkling from many wine labels what sort of wine type is in the bottle. And 
speakers encouraged wine makers to adopt a uniform terminology for sweetness 
and stick to it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No U.S. Definition 
</P>
<P>
It was pointed out, however, that the U.S. government has no definition of any 
sort for the word dry on a wine label, so in theory a wine maker could use that 
term for a wine that had 2% residual sugar, which to most people is not dry. 
Some wineries, such as Firestone in Santa Barbara, have sold a lot of very good 
Riesling without indicating the sweetness level at all. (Firestone said here 
that, beginning with its 1989 Riesling, it will indicate on its label that it 
makes Riesling in an off-dry style.) 
</P>
<P>
Tasting through dozens of Rieslings during this conference, I was intrigued by 
a number of dry (trocken) and nearly dry (halbtrocken) German wines. All, 
however, were imported just for this conference by a German trade contingent 
that was about as energetic in promoting its wines as was the local Washington 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The most exciting thing about this conference was the unveiling of Washington's 
great wines, Riesling among them, to some newcomers to them. This display 
reminded me of something I've known since my first visit to Washington years 
ago: Washington is one of the finest regions in the world for wines, but it's a 
region that has yet to be discovered by many Americans because of the plodding 
reluctance of wholesalers to carry these exciting and often well-priced wines. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the Rieslings evaluated at this conference was a superb 1988 Dry 
Johannisberg Riesling from Hogue Cellars. It has .65% residual sugar, just 
enough to take the edge off sharp, steely acidity, and the aroma is excitingly 
spicy. It's a perfect match for seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Close behind was a lovely 1988 Dry Riesling from Paul Thomas Winery in Bellevue 
($7) that offers a delicate juniper/orange blossom complexity and perfect 
balance for lighter foods. 
</P>
<P>
Covey Run, under new wine maker David Crippen, has a slightly less dry (1.3% 
residual sugar) 1988 Johannisberg Riesling ($6) with a stylish pear aroma that 
would work well with lighter dishes in cream sauces. 
</P>
<P>
All three of these wineries distribute their wines in California and all are 
worth seeking out. 
</P>
<P>
Failing to find them, one might seek out three new releases from Jekel 
Vineyards in Monterey County, all made by new wine maker Steve Pessagno. The 
most intriguing is 1988 Jekel Johannisberg Riesling Dry-Styled ($6.75). This 
steely wine (.3% residual sugar) has a spice/pear aroma that's hard to 
describe. In its style it's a dramatic alternative to Sauvignon Blanc for 
serving with grilled seafood. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Jekel Johannisberg Riesling (regular bottling, $6.75) has 1.9% 
residual sugar, offers more of the same lovely aroma, but a softer taste. 
Jekel's "Sweet-Styled" Riesling ($10), with 6% residual sugar, is a handsome 
dessert wine, great with fresh fruit.

Winery to Watch 
</P>
<P>
A Washington winery to watch (and one marketing only in Northern California at 
present) is Kiona Vineyards, located in the Columbia Valley. Its 1988 Dry White 
Riesling ($6) has but .7% residual sugar and offers a delightful Muscat-like 
spice and a superb finish. 
</P>
<P>
Any of these wines served with food can be a more exciting match than you'd get 
with many of today's overblown Chardonnays. And considering the prices, these 
are all best-buys in dinner wine. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, I've always been surprised that restaurants don't understand the 
marvelous opportunities inherent in dry Riesling. Failure to offer at least one 
dry Riesling shortchanges the diner. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's other wines can be dramatically good too, as evidenced by a 
tasting conducted a week ago in conjunction with the conference. At that 
two-hour, walk-around event I found a number of marvelous Northwest wines worth 
recommending. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1986 Covey Run Cabernet Sauvignon ($10): Classic herbal notes and delicate 
body combine with high acidity and lower-than-expected tannins to make for a 
wine of grand potential. It may be controversial because of its delicate 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1986 Columbia Winery Semillon ($6): Delicate mild herb and lanolin notes 
and a creamy finish make it immediately appealing, but it's sure to age well. A 
lovely Graves-style effort by wine maker and master of wine David Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1983 Salmon Bay Cabernet Sauvignon ($10): Round, chocolaty and fairly 
deeply flavored, this rich wine is well-priced and shows great potential. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1987 Columbia Merlot "Milestone" ($15): One of the most beautiful Merlots 
I've ever tasted, with very deep-scented fruit and chocolaty nuances, a 
spice/cedar element and amazing concentration without over-ripeness. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1985 Columbia Cabernet Sauvignon ($15): Grapes off Mike Sauer's Red Willow 
Vineyard have long been the heart of Columbia's red wines, and here Lake 
fashions them into a gorgeous and long-lived wine that has roasted nut elements 
in a deep, concentrated, herbal package. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1987 Arbor Crest Merlot ($10): Rich black cherry notes in an approachable 
yet age-worthy wine of balance and harmony. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear that among U.S. wine-growing regions, Washington now ranks second to 
California in terms of overall quality, and it's only a matter of time before 
these wines will all be widely available here, providing competition 
Californians never imagined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Washington's Treasures 
</P>
<P>
Now, the wines are hard to find unless you go there. But touring Washington's 
wine country isn't as easy as touring Napa or Temecula. It is, however, an 
untapped and little-trodden adventure. And along the way you may discover even 
more exciting wines that are made in infinitesimal quantities. 
</P>
<P>
Among those making superb wines are Quilceda Creek, Leonetti Cellars, Staton 
Hills, Mount Baker, Latah Creek and Woodward Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
For details on who carries the wines of Washington or for information on 
touring the Washington wine country, call Simon Siegl at the Washington Wine 
Institute, (206) 728-2252. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1987 Hogue Semillon ($7.50) -- Stunningly scented with new 
mown hay and figs and offering a creamy finish in an otherwise citrusy crisp 
effort, this is wine maker Rob Griffin's top wine, in my view. With the Hogue 
family's exceptional fruit, Griffin could become America's greatest Semillon 
maker. Now if only there weren't a Semillon Problem. . . .

THE KITCHEN CABINET: DECORATORS ARE ACCESSORIZING IN COLOR COMBOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We may be going back to the age of the pristine white-enamel era, or what was 
described as "the sanitary white kitchen" of yesteryear, but accessorizing in 
color is still the fashion word in housewares today. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the late '20s when a rainbow of color began to radiate in home 
kitchens. According to "The Housewares Story Book" by Earl Lifshey, published 
by the National Housewares Assn. in Chicago, Macy's was credited with 
originating the scheme. The New York store's campaign ad, illustrating kitchen 
tools and accessories in Delft blue, apple green and mandarin red, ran a 
headline: "Color Comes Into Your Kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
Although there were stages of avocado, copper-tone and harvest gold between 
then and now (around the early '70s), the first group of standard colors 
adopted for kitchen accessories by the first color committee of the National 
Retail Dry Goods Assn. were white, kitchen green, ivory, delphinium blue, royal 
blue and red. They were actually a shade closer to the dominant colors we have 
now in some kitchen appliances and cookware. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colors on the Cabinets 
</P>
<P>
In cabinetwork, light is the word. John Pace, technical director in kitchen 
design at California Kitchens in Burbank, stated that the trend in kitchen 
cabinet finish is still in white or the pale natural tones. Wood-Mode, a 
cabinet manufacturer, for instance, now makes Alpine white as well as delicate 
pastel tones such as peach blush, Champagne and teal breeze. 
</P>
<P>
Millbrook makes beautifully crafted curved cabinets in exciting high-gloss 
colors of hunter green, pink, blue and red; however, Pace said the white 
definitely has greater appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"People are in the kitchen for many hours a day, so a shocking cabinet color 
might get on their nerves. When you go to white, you can accessorize, according 
to how bold you want to get -- say, a black fruit bowl or orange canister -- to 
give a room a different character. To be on the safe side, work with the 
spectrum chart, otherwise go with a pleasing contrast." 
</P>
<P>
Countertops can fill in for the one color needed in the kitchen. Colorful 
choices ran the gamut from pastel to bold in laminated marble-like or plain 
Formica countertops and nonporous synthetic marbles such as Nevamar's 
Fountainhead, Corian and Avonite, to real granite. "When using granite, avoid 
getting too heavy; black and the darker shades can be overbearing; the light 
tans and light reds are easier to live with," Pace advised. 
</P>
<P>
Smooth countertops may be running in favor with many homemakers, but tiles are 
again getting renewed attention. According to Pace, what has helped the 
industry is improvement in grouting with new colors and the introduction of a 
plasticizer to aid in cleaning, as well as new sealers to maintain the neat 
look of tiles. There's no end to what you can do with tiles and they certainly 
provide color in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
In her new book called "Country Floors' Decorating With Tiles" (Simon and 
Shuster: $29.95), crafts and design authority Rosyln Siegel writes, "Choosing a 
color scheme depends on a number of factors: the colors you like best, the 
colors already in or near the room, the feeling you hope to convey and probably 
some of the color preferences you have absorbed from the current fashion 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain color combinations suggest feelings and attitudes that are almost 
universal. Black and white convey a high-tech, modern look, while pink and 
yellow evoke a more delicate, romantic feeling. Combining pale colors provides 
a restful effect. Sharp contrasts, such as black and gold, and red and midnight 
blue, work to create drama. Unusual color combinations -- lilac and red, pink 
and green -- can be exciting and unsettling, a focal point in the room." 
</P>
<P>
The picturesque book is filled with beautiful tile designs from Country Floors, 
an international tile importing company. The author worked with top designers 
at Country Floors to discuss the elements of style in tile decorating, showing 
how to use color, pattern, size, shape and texture to achieve a desired look. 
Styles illustrated range from antique to traditional to contemporary, featuring 
such examples as romantic florals, geometrics, mosaics, picture tiles and 
murals, rustic and country. 
</P>
<P>
Currently attracting a lot of interest at Country Floors' L.A. showroom is a 
group of wall tiles, which are made in America, called coloratura. Named the WT 
Series, this Technicolor aria consists of the largest range of colors with 
high-gloss glaze and evocative Art Deco borders. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are having fun with color," says Sheri Hirschfeld, showroom 
manager. "The thing about these tiles is that you can work with them like a 
puzzle, mixing colors and geometric patterns." 
</P>
<P>
Other Country Floor tile selections with magnificent colors of teal, lilac, 
salmon and blue include rustic double-glazed tiles from France and Italy that 
you can mix and match with some of their stunning hand-painted picture tiles. 
</P>
<P>
A splash of color can come from a simple faucet. KWC's hot red model adds a 
dash of color to its single levered Neodecor line of Swiss-made black, gray, 
white, chrome and almond faucets. "A faucet is best seen and not heard" is 
KWC's logic in designing the quiet Neostar faucet, another line designed with 
no little nooks and crannies and one that uses a conical seated valve. 
</P>
<P>
Another KWC model is the Neodomo faucet, which is made with custom controls, 
adjusters that allow you to limit temperature and water flow for safe comfort 
and energy savings. This unit also features a retractable spray that lets you 
bring water a few feet away from the faucet. KWC also makes cover plates, soap 
dispensers and lotion dispensers to match faucet tones. Other manufacturers 
that have added color to their faucet lines are Moen International, Hansgrohe 
and Hansa America Inc. For sink color, consider selections from Kohler, which 
has long been known for vivid colored enameled cast-iron sinks. The trend 
however, according to Pace, is to use synthetic pure silicate quartz sinks such 
as those from Blanco or Gaggenau. Exceptionally easy to clean, this type of 
sink is not affected by strong staining liquids. To clean their sinks, 
homeowners like to use cleansers that will scrub off the glaze in porcelain 
sinks, exposing the metal, Pace said. The quartz pigmentation is done 
throughout, so that any chip on a white sink will still expose white, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Portable electric appliances and teakettles that are displayed on the counter 
or stove top can also supply a spot of color in the kitchen. Getting a positive 
consumer response with their empire green (a pine or forest green) gadgets 
(such as the KitchenAid mixer, Chantal whistling teakettle, Krups coffee maker 
and grinder) is Williams-Sonoma. Like the cobalt blue kitchen ware with which 
they started a trend, the green is projected to follow its successful 
footsteps, according to Anne Kupper, public relations director for the chain. 
</P>
<P>
"Forest green, not the sickly avocado green, has always been popular for us in 
tablecloths and other accessories," Kupper explained. "It's a strong green, 
Mother Nature's color that goes with anything. It goes with yellow and blue; 
it's a wonderful sharp contrast with white and with wood tones. Green is so 
fresh. We tried red but we were not as successful." 
</P>
<P>
Many people are just as happy getting colors from their cookware. Long known 
for introducing strong colors in their French cookware line in enameled cast 
iron, Le Creuset from Schiller and Asmus has just introduced four new colors 
this year. They include the oven-to-table Paris Tabletop line's Southwestern 
colors of teal and apricot, as well as Carmine Red and shiny black. (They still 
have white, slate blue, cobalt blue and flame.) The new design cookware, which 
may be used for induction cooking, is called Le Creuset Nouveau and features 
Glissemail, a new, shiny porcelain finish that can withstand high temperatures 
and thermal shock. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the bright colored aluminum tumblers of the early '50s that you 
probably now spot in garage sales and thrift shops? Sitlax now produces these 
in even brighter Neon Jewel tones. Tumblers, trays, coasters and wine buckets 
are available in neon tones of gold, blue, Kelly green, pink, red, violet, 
turquoise, magenta, black and silver. The tumblers are terrific with iced 
drinks -- remember how the exterior got very frosty? 
</P>
<P>
Color in kitchen linens often follows fabrics in fashion. At the recent New 
York Fabric Show, the projection of the leading color, design and fabric 
influences moving into spring and summer of 1990 are, according to the Pantone 
Color Institute, influenced by a botanical garden of spring flowers: pastels, 
white and cream, dusty rose, rouge, cherry, peach, lavender, lilac, tourmaline, 
celadon, laurel green and primrose yellow. 
</P>
<P>
In the harvest hues are wheat, oat, flax, straw, maize, clay, earthy browns, 
herbal greens, sage, wild grasses and flowers, moss. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, influenced by world culture is a kaleidoscope of colors, contrasting 
with black, white, ivory and some metallics for accents: bright tropicals such 
as orchids, flamingo, turquoise; foliage greens with white; fiesta brights, 
red, orange, yellow, violet . . . and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, anything goes with color.

LET'S EAT OUT: KOREAN RESTAURANT THAT RISES ABOVE THE ORDINARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reviewing Restaurant Yeejoh has been a challenge. Why? Because I've developed a 
fixation on one dish, and that makes it difficult to move on through the 
absorbing menu of this Korean restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The dish in question is dae ji bul ko ki -- barbecued pork. It is different in 
flavor from Korean barbecued beef -- more spicy, redder in color and less 
strong on soy sauce. If you've got the nerve, you can eat it the way Koreans 
do, rolled in cabbage leaves with cloves of raw garlic. 
</P>
<P>
For a perfect meal, I'd have this with bin dae duk, pancakes that are soft 
inside, golden brown on the outside and as tempting as an American flapjack. 
The difference is, they're made from ground beans and contain bean sprouts and 
green onions. 
</P>
<P>
Such a meal would take in a lot of food because it comes with rice, tea, soup, 
dessert and an assortment of relishes. These vary from day to day but usually 
include at least two forms of kimchi. There also might be fried tiny fish, 
marinated spinach, marinated bean sprouts, sliced fish cake, hotly seasoned 
carrots, chewy, syrup-coated beans or other tidbits. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is summer, the restaurant has switched to cold soup and iced corn 
tea rather than hot. The soup the other day was mi yuk kook, a combination of 
clear broth and mi yuk, which is a leafy seaweed. Employed as a restorative for 
women who have given birth, this soup may follow the infants through life 
because it is also served on birthdays, a Korean told me. 
</P>
<P>
Yeejoh is owned by Bo Ae Kim, a leading Korean film actress, and her husband, 
Jong Ho Kim. Although rather obscurely located in a shopping center at the far 
eastern fringe of Koreatown, it does not lack for customers. The room itself is 
rather plain, but gleaming wooden furniture from Korea, silken pillows in 
splashy colors and waitresses garbed in the hanbok, the traditional Korean 
dress, lift it from the ordinary. It is definitely not a smoke-filled room 
because the barbecuing is done in the kitchen, not at the table. 
</P>
<P>
Once I asked a Korean friend to order lunch and gave up the barbecued pork to 
try a parade of sumptuous dishes. Oxtail stew -- kori kim -- was an enticing 
blend of meat with Asian red dates, pine nuts, white radish and carrots, all of 
this crowned with green onion tops and omelet shreds. Then came a platter of 
oysters, shrimp, fish and vegetables, each piece coated with egg and fried. The 
charm of this dish lies in its 
</P>
<P>
simplicity and delicacy, but cooking it properly is not as easy as one might 
think, my friend observed. 
</P>
<P>
Then we went to the other extreme with a gutsy kimchi casserole, using its 
fiery orange broth to season our rice. We also had cho gae tang, which, for my 
taste, is one of the world's great soups. The menu describes it as oyster 
broth, but what we had was wonderful peppery broth crammed with clams in the 
shell, soy bean sprouts and a leafy green named sukat. Then we munched on 
crisp, oiled, salted sheets of nori, wrapping these around rice or eating them 
plain. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch ended with fruit and bowls of sweet rice punch. Pine nuts and a few rice 
grains floated in the sweet, ginger-flavored punch, which was cool and light 
after our strongly seasoned meal. 
</P>
<P>
Returning another day, I automatically chose barbecued pork but added something 
new, kongae bokom. The menu's translation is crab with sauce and seasoning. 
This is accurate but hardly describes what came -- a bowl piled high with crab 
legs drenched with thick and spicy sauce. The procedure is to extract the crab 
meat with chopsticks. If this is too difficult, one can pick up the legs and 
chew them. A third option is to place the body shells on a plate, spoon on 
rice, mix it with the sauce and enjoy the flavor without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Yeejoh's prices are reasonable. Barbecued pork and barbecued beef are $11.50 
each, which includes the accompaniments. The oyster broth-clam soup is $11.50; 
kongae bokom, the crab dish, is $15.50, and kori jim, the oxtail stew, is 
$13.95. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restaurant Yeejoh, 2500 W. 8th St., No. 108, Los Angeles; call (213) 380-3346 
for reservations. Open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to midnight. Closed 
Sunday. Visa and MasterCard accepted. Park in shopping center where restaurant 
is located or on the street.

BACK TO BASICS: BLANCHING: CRITICAL STEP FOR FROZEN VEGETABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blanching, or scalding, is a critical step in preparing fresh vegetables for 
freezing. This process cleanses the vegetable surfaces of dirt and organisms, 
brings up their color, helps retain vitamins and reduces the action of enzymes 
that otherwise would destroy their fresh flavor after about a month in the 
freezer. 
</P>
<P>
The fresher the vegetables are when frozen, the more satisfactory the end 
product. Choose those at their peak of ripeness and process them as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Freezing retards the growth of bacteria but does not sterilize the food. 
Therefore, sanitary measures in the handling and processing of foods are very 
important. 
</P>
<P>
Before blanching, wash, drain, sort, trim and cut the vegetables the same as 
you would if you were cooking them fresh. Use one gallon of water to blanch 
each pound of vegetables -- two gallons for a pound of leafy greens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's All in the Timing 
</P>
<P>
Place the vegetables in a wire basket and lower it into vigorously boiling 
water (Step 1). Begin counting the blanching time as soon as the vegetables 
enter the water. Keep the heat on high and stir the water or cover the 
container during blanching. 
</P>
<P>
Time the blanching carefully, using the following chart. Under-blanching 
stimulates enzyme activity rather than reducing it; prolonged scalding causes 
loss of vitamins, minerals, flavor and color. 
</P>
<P>
Remove the vegetables from the boiling water and immediately plunge into ice 
water (Step 2) to stop the cooking process. Stir the vegetables as they cool 
for approximately the same amount of time they were blanched. If more than one 
batch of vegetables is being prepared, the hot vegetables may be poured into a 
colander set in the ice water so the wire basket can be reused. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airtight Packaging 
</P>
<P>
Pack the cooled vegetables loosely into moisture-and-vapor-proof containers 
(Step 3). Seal, label with the contents and date (Step 4), then place the 
containers in a single layer in the freezer, leaving about one inch of space 
between the packages so they freeze quickly. Once completely frozen, packages 
may be compactly stacked. Frozen vegetables should be used within one year. 
</P>
<P>
When large quantities of vegetables are being processed, determine the amount 
that can be blanched in 15 minutes and keep the remainder under refrigeration 
until the first batch has been packaged. The same scalding water may be reused 
for the same product, adding water as needed to retain the proper level. 
</P>

<P>
DEAR SOS: I recently had the comforting pleasure of dining on the Irish bread 
pudding at Gilliland's in Santa Monica. Please indulge me with a recipe so I 
can delight my family with this homey bread. 
</P>
<P>
 -- PATTY 
</P>
<P>
DEAR PATTY: Guess what? Gilliland, who is from Ireland and is the chef-owner of 
Gilliland's, mistakenly sent us a recipe for Irish soda bread instead. It is 
such a good bread we thought we'd give the recipe until the pudding recipe 
shows up. Gilliland's breads (and pastries) are divine and the soda bread is no 
exception. Wonderful for brunch or salad lunches. 
</P>
<P>
GILLILAND'S IRISH SODA BREAD 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon soda 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 cups buttermilk 
</P>
<P>
Sift together flours, salt, soda and sugar in bowl. Make well in center and 
stir in buttermilk until soft, but not sticky. 
</P>
<P>
Turn out onto floured board and form into flat patty 6 to 8-inches in diameter. 
With sharp knife cut crisscross 1/2-inch deep. Bake at 350 degrees 40 to 50 
minutes or until golden. Cool before slicing. Makes 1 loaf. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: We do quite a bit of salmon fishing and would like to make our own 
lox. I would appreciate any help in getting recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LOIS 
</P>
<P>
DEAR LOIS: Lox (cured salmon), also called gravad lax or gravlox in 
Scandinavian countries, is a specialty of Scandia restaurant in Los Angeles, 
where this recipe originated. It's a great recipe to keep in mind for summer 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
SCANDIA'S GRAVAD LAX 
</P>
<P>
1 (2-pound) piece salmon 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons salt 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon crushed peppercorns 
</P>
<P>
1/2 bunch dill 
</P>
<P>
Mustard-Dill Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Thaw salmon if frozen. Cut salmon in halves lengthwise. Remove bones. Combine 
salt, sugar and peppercorns. Rub half spice mixture over 1 salmon half and 
place fish, skin side down, in baking dish. Spread dill over. 
</P>
<P>
Rub other half of salmon with remaining spice mixture and place, skin side up, 
on first salmon half. Cover with foil. Place plate on top of fish and weight on 
top of plate. 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerate 48 hours. Turn fish over every 12 hours, separating fillets 
slightly to baste with pan liquid. 
</P>
<P>
When ready to serve, scrape away dill and seasonings. Place fillets, skins side 
down, on cutting board. Cut salmon diagonally in thin slices away from skin. 
Serve cold with Mustard-Dill sauce. Makes 24 appetizers servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mustard-Dill Sauce 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dry mustard 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup oil 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons chopped dill 
</P>
<P>
Combine mustard, sugar, vinegar and dry mustard. Slowly beat in oil until 
thick. Stir in dill. Chill. Makes 3/4 cup. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Would you please find out how Mexican restaurants prepare their fried 
ice cream? It has a corn-flake type, sugary covering and some syrup on the 
bottom. It's an excellent treat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- D. Q. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR D. Q.: Fried Mexican Ice Cream is made by covering scoops of ice cream 
with sugared corn flake crumbs, then dipping them in an egg batter to seal the 
coating before frying. Honey is drizzled on the dessert. It is an excellent 
do-ahead dessert because you can freeze the coated ice cream balls until ready 
to pop in the fryer. 
</P>
<P>
FRIED MEXICAN ICE CREAM 
</P>
<P>
1 pint vanilla or other flavor ice cream 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup crushed corn flake or cookie crumbs 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 egg 
</P>
<P>
Oil for deep frying 
</P>
<P>
Honey 
</P>
<P>
Whipped cream 
</P>
<P>
Scoop out 4 or 5 balls of ice cream. Return to freezer. Mix corn flake crumbs, 
cinnamon and sugar in shallow bowl. Roll frozen ice cream balls in 1/2 crumb 
mixture and freeze again. 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg and dip coated balls in egg, then roll again in remaining crumbs. 
Freeze until ready to use. (For thicker coating, repeat dipping in egg and 
rolling in crumbs.) 
</P>
<P>
When ready to serve, heat oil to 350 degrees. Place 1 frozen ice cream ball in 
fryer basket or on perforated spoon and lower into hot oil for 1 minute. 
Immediately remove and place in chilled dessert dish. Drizzle with honey and 
dollop with whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
Serve immediately or keep in freezer while continuing to fry remaining balls, 1 
at time. Balls will be crunchy on outside and just beginning to melt inside. 
Makes 4 to 5 servings. 
</P>

'WHAT'S COOKING AT MOUNT TABOR': DISHING UP A TASTE OF NOSTALGIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My friend, Lee Witte, invited me to our annual get-together lunch at the Bistro 
Garden and then presented me with a copy of the Mount Tabor Freewill Baptist 
Church, Creswell, N.C., cookbook. 
</P>
<P>
The church on the cover looked starkly old American; brick and clapboard with a 
hardware store screen door that I could almost hear creaking as it opened and 
closed. I could see the Welcome on the service schedule board and felt it. 
</P>
<P>
"The cooks in that book are all my relatives, starting with Aunt Clara who 
raised me," said Witte, whose Southern accent has a decided English tilt, 
typical, she says, of the 15th-Century coastal North Carolina settlement where 
she grew up. Her ancestors, she says, have been living in parts around Creswell 
since. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Long Way We've Come 
</P>
<P>
We ordered the chopped chef's salad and the waiter passed the crisp rolls. 
"Some iced tea?" he asked. "No, iced coffee," I said, and picked up a Cristofle 
fork to dig into the salad. 
</P>
<P>
As I flipped through the pages of "What's Cooking at Mount Tabor," I found 
myself thinking about the long way we've come since the days when picnic 
macaroni made with canned luncheon meat and sweet pickles or "bar-b-que" sauce 
for pork or venison sounded good. 
</P>
<P>
Or when meat balls stroganoff made with catsup and canned mushroom soup were 
considered company fare. And when squash casserole made with cream of chicken 
soup and stuffing mix could send you to culinary heaven and back. 
</P>
<P>
Well, to tell the truth, I felt more than a twinge of nostalgia for those days, 
those tastes, sitting at the Bistro thousands of light years from the smell of 
squash casserole, sweet potato pudding, mayonnaise rolls or do-nothing cake, a 
dessert in which all the ingredients are mixed together and baked. 
</P>
<P>
A beautiful platter of salmon with sorrel sauce floated by our table and was 
served with a flourish to a woman who looked like Princess Di. 
</P>
<P>
I went back to pork-chop casserole on page 9 of the Mount Tabor book, which 
struck me as especially tempting. All you do is brown the chops, add a layer of 
sliced onions and layer of sliced potatoes and top it all off with a can of 
mushroom soup diluted with water. Then you bake it for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delightful Casserole 
</P>
<P>
I could picture the casserole at a church supper brought in by Aunt Clara. A 
lot of love goes in those casseroles, I'll bet. And I'll take a bite any time. 
</P>
<P>
"Some low-calorie dessert today, ladies?" asked Ralph, our waiter with a wink. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, come on, Ralphy," Witte said coyly. "You want me to spoil my girlish 
figure?" Then her voice went down a naughty decibel and she moved the Emmanuel 
Kahn bifocals on her pert nose down a centimeter or two. "What have you got?" 
she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph rattled off the dessert menu: raspberry torte, apple tarte tatin, 
chocolate mousse and chocolate walnut cake, cheesecake and lemon meringue 
torte. 
</P>
<P>
It just happened that my eyes were locked on the peach cobbler recipe on page 
68 in the cookbook's dessert chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"You have peach cobbler, by chance?" I asked, knowing he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"No, Madame, I'm afraid we don't," Ralph said, "but we do have iced fresh 
peaches, if that is satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, iced fresh peaches sounded very satisfactory, but I wasn't up to them. 
I suddenly had a hankering for hot peach cobbler, with the warm sauce melting 
the homemade vanilla ice cream over the peaches. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, well. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, honey," Witte said to me. "Go back to work and I'll get hubby to come pick 
me up," she ordered. She gave me a hug, drawing me like a Raggedy Anne doll 
into her buxom frame in a way that meant love. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Welcome on the Mount Tabor Freewill Baptist Church service schedule 
board means love. 
</P>
<P>
Like the pork-chop casserole and the hot peach cobbler in "What's Cooking at 
Mount Tabor." 
</P>
<P>
 Note: A copy of "What's Cooking at Mount Tabor" can be obtained by sending $5, 
plus $1.25 for handling, to Mount Tabor Freewill Baptist Church, Attention 
Ladies Auxiliary, Route 2, Box 177-A, Creswell, N.C. 27928. 
</P>
<P>

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: THERE ARE LEANER AND LIGHTER ALTERNATIVES FOR BACK-YARD 
BARBECUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We hate to risk being accused of raining on that great American institution, 
the summer barbecue. But as nutritionists, we must point out that hamburgers 
and frankfurter, accompanied by macaroni, potato salad and potato chips -- the 
stuff of traditional barbecues -- are best reserved for a very occasional 
treat. 
</P>
<P>
But hold on, and don't put the grill in storage: Believe it or not, you can 
find culinary happiness in alternatives that are lower in fat, calories and 
sodium. 
</P>
<P>
These leaner, lighter choices begin with a focus on chicken and fish, both 
excellent candidates for the outdoor grill. For chicken, the key to variety 
lies in marinades that extend well beyond the usual sauces (invariably some 
shade of red) sold in the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
One favorite, reminiscent of the Caribbean, is a mixture of oil, lime juice and 
minced onion seasoned with tarragon and hot pepper sauce. Teriyaki sauce, 
seasoned with a little brown sugar and mixed with a few drops of sesame oil, 
white vinegar and mustard is another good option to brush onto chicken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Indian Touch 
</P>
<P>
For a marinade of chicken legs with an Indian touch, season one-quarter cup 
each of lemon juice and oil with six cloves of minced garlic, one tablespoon 
minced ginger root, one tablespoon ground cumin and several generous dashes of 
hot pepper sauce. Indeed, it is possible to grill anything from chunks of white 
meat on skewers or pounded breast, brushed lightly with oil, to quarters with 
the bone left in. To get the job done more quickly, precook chicken in the 
microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
For fish, the sheer variety of choices, including shellfish such as shrimp and 
scallops, and the different combinations of herbs are all you need to create an 
endless parade of tastes. The teriyaki mixture we've suggested for chicken goes 
equally well on fish, especially tuna steaks and bluefish. The flavor of salmon 
steaks may be enhanced with sprinklings of thyme, sage, parsley and pepper 
before grilling. If you want to serve it with a sauce, try yogurt with plenty 
of minced cucumber folded in and seasoned with dill, grated onion and white 
pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary, lavender leaves, crushed fennel and cumin seeds are another good herb 
blend for seasoning fish. And, of course, in the summer months nothing is 
better than fresh, chopped basil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayonnaise Alternatives 
</P>
<P>
As for accompaniments, our program begins with a farewell to mayonnaise. Yes, 
it does a nice job of holding potatoes, macaroni, cole slaw and even rice 
together, but at around 100 calories a tablespoon, it's a good idea to seek 
alternatives. A delicious side dish to go along with chicken is a lentil salad, 
popular in France in the summer but rarely seen here. To prepare it, a cup of 
lentils, providing six servings, is cooked with an onion stuck with two cloves 
and a bay leaf until tender. They are then drained, tossed with a minced onion, 
about two tablespoons each of oil and wine vinegar, chopped parsley, a little 
salt and freshly ground black pepper. 
</P>
<P>
A rice salad is another neglected option. Cooked rice is simply tossed with a 
little oil, lemon juice or wine vinegar, minced parsley and green onions. If 
you want more volume for calories, extend the salad by adding sliced water 
chestnuts, blanched bean sprouts and some lightly cooked green beans. You might 
also try seasoning it with cilantro, or Chinese parsley leaves. 
</P>
<P>
We also recommend a French potato salad, prepared by tossing sliced, small 
cooked potatoes with white wine vinegar, a little oil, and seasoning it with 
chopped parsley, chives and tarragon. 
</P>
<P>
Grilled vegetables are an increasingly popular feature at barbecues, and that 
is all to the good. Easily cooked on skewers or in pans specially designed for 
the task (or sometimes right on the grill itself), they require only a slight 
brush of oil and, if desired, a strategically chosen herb or two. At a cost of 
very few calories they provide taste, color and texture, not to mention 
vitamins, minerals and fiber. If you'd rather stick to raw vegetables such as 
carrot sticks and pepper rings, or even raw broccoli and cauliflower, try a dip 
made by adding a teaspoon of curry powder to a cup of low-fat yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Favor of Fruit 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, we strongly favor fresh fruit. But if you're in the mood for 
something more elaborate than a watermelon slice or a bowl of cherries, we 
suggest fruit lightly poached in a syrup of equal parts of sugar and water. Our 
favorites include nectarines, apricots or peaches served with a puree of 
raspberries or strawberries. And if you're feeling extra fancy, a small bit of 
liqueur goes a long way toward enhancing the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
As you can see, it's well within your grasp to eat festive, outdoor meals 
without either throwing nutritional principles out the window or sacrificing 
the great tastes of summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Metamucil Fares Well in Cholesterol Study 
</P>
<P>
Question: I recently heard on the radio that a "bulking agent" commonly used to 
promote normal bowel movements also lowers cholesterol. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Results of recent studies do suggest that psyllium hydrophilic 
mucilloid, more familiar as Metamucil, does lower serum cholesterol. Psyllium 
is a water-soluble, gel-forming fiber derived from the husks of blond psyllium 
seeds. It belongs to a group of soluble fibers that include gums, pectins, 
mucilages and certain hemicelluloses that have been shown to lower serum 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
In the trial reported most recently, a group of men and women with mild to 
moderate elevation of serum cholesterol were placed on the National Cholesterol 
Education Program's "Step One Diet" to reduce serum cholesterol. On that diet, 
30% of the calories come from fat, 55% from carbohydrate and 15% from protein. 
It provides no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol daily. 
</P>
<P>
After 12 weeks, subjects judged appropriate to the trial were divided into two 
groups. One group was given packets of Metamucil, the other an inert cellulose 
fiber. They were instructed to take the fiber in water three times a day before 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
The group adhered to the regimen remarkably well. Compared to those who 
received the inert fiber, subjects who took the psyllium achieved an additional 
reduction of almost 5% in total cholesterol level, and an 8% reduction in 
low-density lipoprotein associated with increased risk of heart attack. 
Moreover, the use of psyllium did not have adverse effects on other important 
health indicators, among them blood pressure, blood sugar levels and HDL 
cholesterol levels, associated with decreased risk of heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Some subjects did suffer mild gastrointestinal complaints, but these were 
considered transient and minor. None was serious enough to require 
discontinuation of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The authors of this study, which was conducted at the Hennepin County Medical 
Center in Minneapolis, Minn., were frank to point out that the amount of 
soluble fiber can be increased by diet, and they emphasize that the psyllium 
seed was used in addition to a diet for lowering serum cholesterol. The 
decision to use Metamucil as a cholesterol-lowering adjunct to your diet should 
be made only after a discussion with your physician to determine if it is 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you tell me how to choose one of the "preferred" margarines, if one is 
trying to control serum cholesterol? 
</P>
<P>
A: The nutrition-labeling panel is the best guide. Directly below the number of 
grams per serving, on most margarines you will find two other numbers. The 
number next to the "p" is for the amount of polyunsaturated fat it contains; 
the "s" is for the amount of saturated fat. To select those you describe as 
"preferred," choose among the many options where the amount of polyunsaturated 
is larger than the amount of saturates. And, the larger the better. The two 
numbers will not add up to the total amount of fat, because the margarines also 
contain monounsaturates. 
</P>
<P>
People often inquire about why margarines advertised as "rich in 
polyunsaturates" contain a more saturated fat, such as partially hydrogenated 
soybean oil, as the second ingredient. The explanation is simply that, without 
it, you would have liquid oil, not solid margarine. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have always avoided buying meats packaged in heavy plastic wrap. While the 
price is often less than for meats in standard packaging, I have been put off 
by the unusually dark color. I assumed that it meant either that it was a lower 
grade of meat or that additives had been added to prolong freshness. While 
staying with a friend recently, she bought and served a large piece of 
vacuum-packed meat. It tasted perfectly fine, but before I'm sold on it I'd 
like an explanation for the color difference. 
</P>
<P>
A: The dark color indicates neither a quality difference nor the use of 
additives. It is the result of a lack of exposure of the meat to oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
The type of cuts you are describing are called subprimals. Whole beef carcasses 
are usually split into five large primal cuts, which are then divided into 
subprimals. Most beef is now cut into subprimals at the packing plant, 
vacuum-packed immediately and shipped to the supermarket. Those available 
directly to consumers are usually the best parts of those cuts, with much of 
the bone and other waste already trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
When the package is opened, the meat "blooms" -- turning the bright color with 
which you are familiar. Vacuum-packed meats do have an odor, described as sour 
or off when opened, but it disappears within an hour after opening. These meats 
have not been previously frozen, so they can be stored in the freezer as is or 
cut into smaller pieces and repackaged.

GLENDALE FEARS AIR RULES COULD HIKE POWER COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stringent new air quality regulations on electrical power production in the Los 
Angeles Basin could cause record increases in utility rates to consumers, 
Glendale city officials warned this week. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District next week is expected to adopt 
rules that could force Glendale to double the city's bonded indebtedness by $50 
million and boost residential electric rates by 13.6%, according to a report 
presented Tuesday to the Glendale City Council by W. E. Cameron, city public 
service director. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jerold Milner accused the district of attempting "to become a super 
government" by imposing rules that may force the city to abandon its power 
production plants altogether. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Animosity 
</P>
<P>
The criticism demonstrated an apparent growing animosity among officials in 
Glendale and other cities over the state agency's efforts to clear the air in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Councilman Carl Raggio said Tuesday: "Sometime this tea party is going 
to have to have some different people sit at the table. We can't let the Tom 
Haydens of the world continue to be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
The rules scheduled to be adopted at a AQMD hearing Aug. 4 would require all 
electrical producers to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from gas turbine 
engines and steam boilers by installing expensive catalytic reduction 
equipment, Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
The new equipment would cost Glendale more than $50.4 million -- double the 
city's total present debt of $50 million, said Brian Butler, city finance 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The rule would apply to Glendale, Burbank and Pasadena -- which produce a 
relatively small amount of supplemental electrical power -- as well as to the 
giant Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Southern California 
Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale officials said they are considering abandoning the city's power plant 
or joining Burbank and Pasadena to develop a new plant outside the AQMD's 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Energy Policy 
</P>
<P>
"We might have to review our entire energy policy before we spend the money," 
Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
However, air quality district officials said the proposed rules on power 
production are part of a wide-ranging plan to reduce nitrogen oxide levels in 
the basin, which they said is the last region in the nation to meet federal 
ambient air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
District spokesman Tom Eichhorn said the cost of the proposed new rules can be 
measured in two ways: Residents can "either pay for it with clean air or pay 
for it with their lungs." 
</P>
<P>
Steven A. Broiles, an attorney representing Glendale, Burbank and Pasadena in 
their fight with the district, called the proposed new regulations "the most 
expensive that the South Coast Air Quality Management District has ever 
adopted." He maintains that they are unworkable, unfeasible and unnecessary as 
a solution to air-pollution problems.

STATE REVERSAL ON PAY CLEARS WAY FOR OPENING COMPTON LAZBEN HOTEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a victory for the city, state labor officials have reversed an earlier 
ruling that last fall halted construction on the nearly $30-million Compton 
Lazben Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The state action Tuesday paved the way for the Aug. 15 opening of the hotel and 
convention center complex. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the state Department of Industrial Relations ruled that the 
contractor, Tucon Development of Sepulveda, had to pay prevailing wages 
established by law because the hotel is a public works project. The city 
successfully appealed the ruling, convincing the state that Compton's charter 
exempted the city from the prevailing wage requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the 288-room hotel complex, a joint project between the city and a 
private developer, was to have opened in May, 1988. The date was later pushed 
back to December and then construction halted for five months after the state 
raised the wage issue. State officials said work could continue while the city 
appealed, but the city and the developer became embroiled in a dispute over 
money and construction standards that was not resolved until April. 
</P>
<P>
If the city had lost the appeal, it might have had to pay about $660,000 in 
back wages to the workers. 
</P>
<P>
Jona M. Liebrecht, president of Lazben Hotel Management Co., said he was 
delighted by the reversal. "We're breathing freely now, knowing that we will 
open." 
</P>
<P>
About 60 people are on the hotel payroll, in addition to the construction 
workers finishing the interior of the building that will house three 
restaurants, including a jazz nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
Had the city lost its appeal, the final phases of construction could have been 
delayed while the city and the hotel developer worked out payment schedules to 
workers who claimed they were owed back wages. 
</P>
<P>
While city officials were congratulating themselves on winning the appeal, a 
employee representative expressed disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible decision," said Floyd Clay, business representative for the 
Los Angeles District Council of Carpenters. "I kind of expected it. There was a 
tremendous amount of money involved and the little people were at the bottom of 
the list with nothing to fight with." 
</P>
<P>
When he first filed the prevailing wage complaint last year with the Department 
of Industrial Relations, Clay was financial secretary of Carpenters Local 1437 
of Compton, which has since been absorbed by Local 630 of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Clay said union attorneys would review the new ruling to determine whether 
there are grounds for an appeal. "We're going to take a look at all the 
documents to see if we can help the little guy," Clay said. "This is what 
unions were founded for. This is a classic example." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complicated Arrangements 
</P>
<P>
The prevailing wage issue rests on a point of labor law that applies to public 
works projects, those paid for with public funds. The hotel project is 
complicated, however, because it is being financed under an arrangement in 
which the city owns the land but is making construction loans to the developer, 
who will have title to the hotel building. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the state ruled that the hotel was a public works project, meaning 
workers had to be paid prevailing wages -- standards set under state law to 
ensure that workers on public, nonunion jobs get wages comparable to what union 
workers make in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Some construction workers at the hotel made as little as $8 an hour, while the 
prevailing wage rate is about $25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The city argued successfully in its appeal, however, that the project was not 
governed by prevailing wage standards because Compton is a charter city and 
chose to exempt itself in 1979 from the constraints of the public works 
designation. Charter cities, said Ron Rinaldi, director of the Department of 
Industrial Relations, have that option. 
</P>
<P>
Rinaldi said that his department's first ruling was based on "misinformation" 
received from the city. John M. Rea, chief counsel for the department, said 
that staff in the Compton city attorney's office initially informed the state 
that the city never put a public works exemption in its charter. 
</P>
<P>
The city also successfully argued that the project was financed and controlled 
by the city, not by its redevelopment agency. The redevelopment agency cannot 
exempt itself from the public works constraint, Rinaldi said.

SURF'S UP -- AND SO IS THE TENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walking down the cliff at Ulu Watu, then maneuvering down a shaky bamboo ladder 
with broken struts into a sea cave is not my idea of an easy water entry. 
</P>
<P>
A week earlier, I was safe and secure inside my house in Orange County, poring 
over past issues of Surfer and Surfing magazines as I prepared for my Bali 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
I've been obsessed with surfing since I was 19 when I learned to surf at 
Huntington Beach on an old surfboard the size of a pier. 
</P>
<P>
At 41, I found myself easing into foreign waters once again, this time at one 
of the world's best surfing spots. 
</P>
<P>
I went to Ulu with Ed Rhead, 34, a former master's competitor from Oceanside, 
and Carolyn Krammer, 44, a former women's pro. They were officials of the 
visiting U.S. surfing team. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, each of us had only read about this prime spot, about 25 miles from 
the hotel district in Kuta Beach. Now we were here. Rhead kept saying, "I don't 
believe we're actually doing this." Krammer, who coaches the Vista High School 
surf team, managed to remain a lot calmer and recorded most of the hilly 
three-kilometer hike on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
At the cave, I asked an Australian surfer, "How do I go out from here?" trying 
to mask the concern I had about a large rock in the middle of the passage way. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was easy, and I followed his instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll only be five to seven feet. No need to worry, boss," our guide had told 
us. A seven-foot wave measured from the back could mean a 14-foot face, I told 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
Scared? Naaaah. My legs already had turned to Jell-O walking down into the 
cave. 
</P>
<P>
Once out in the water, I took off on a small, six-foot wave that was almost 
twice my height overhead. Ulu is a classic left, meaning surfers who face the 
shore travel to their left rather than right. 
</P>
<P>
A set came up. I paddled into one of the first waves, but another surfer who 
had position on me got it. As I turned my board around, I saw something I 
didn't want to think about. A big, green mountain of water, the third of a 
seven-wave set, now loomed in front of me. It jacked up, six feet, then eight, 
then 10, and I looked down at my board. If I got scared now, I told myself, 
I'll be fish bait. 
</P>
<P>
Rhead had already taken one wave that left him dizzy after he fell off and went 
airborne 20 feet before slamming into the water. 
</P>
<P>
It was time. I faced toward shore and paddled mightily. The bottom of the hump 
caught me and propelled me up its huge face like an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
Then I stood up and slipped in and time stood still. I hurtled down the face, 
adrenaline pumping and my mind racing as the salt spray slapped my face. Near 
the bottom I got into a low crouch, knees bent, ready to absorb the G-force 
when I turned left. Think of yourself falling down a mine shaft and turning 
hard after a 12-foot drop. 
</P>
<P>
I spent the speed I had accumulated coming down the wave onto the "flat," that 
area in front of a breaking wave. A mistake at Ulu, I learned. The wave has a 
natural tendency to push anything far out into the flat and regular footers 
like myself, who surf with their left foot forward and their back to the wave 
on a left, must fight the tendency to hit the flat long because you lose speed. 
</P>
<P>
You with me? Caution: If you get behind the wave in the white stuff, the ride's 
over. Caution No. 2: If you lose speed trying to come back into an Ulu lip 
that's blasting over, you go airborne backward without a parachute. 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom, I looked back into the wave and could see the shoulder, but by 
this time I had lost the speed I needed and could only zip halfway up onto the 
shoulder before turning to prepare for another ride down the wave face. After 
that, another surfer had positioned himself to take off and shoulder-hopped me. 
Wave traffic in paradise. 
</P>
<P>
I lowered myself to the board and ended the ride with thundering white water 
behind me. My knees were wobbly, but I felt exuberant. 
</P>
<P>
I had survived Ulu.

BELL PROPOSES TO LEVY $35 IN FEES FOR STREET LIGHTS, SEWER REPAIR

<TEXT>
<P>
Sharon Wade angrily waved two property tax bills in front of the City Council 
on Monday night to protest proposed fees that would help pay for street lights 
and sewer maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first bought this house 10 years ago in 1978, city-related expenses 
were equal to about one-third of the total cost of the tax bill," Wade said 
while holding up one consolidated bill with itemized levies. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it is almost two-thirds of the bill," she added, holding up her 1988 bill. 
"There are a lot of poor families in Bell, and it is too much for them. We need 
lights, but your raising the taxes is just too much." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crowded Hearing 
</P>
<P>
Wade was one of almost 100 residents who packed the Bell City Council chamber 
for a standing-room-only hearing on the two proposed city fees -- $27.50 for 
street lighting and $7.47 for sewer maintenance and sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
The council sees the annual levies as one way to meet the demands of a growing 
city and the resulting strain on its services. The proposal comes at a critical 
point when Bell's revenues, especially from the California Bell Casino, have 
sagged to such low levels that the city must take new measures to build them 
back up, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's meeting the council approved a preliminary budget of more than $10 
million after making cuts worth about $500,000. The cuts include three 
full-time and two part-time city positions, three of which are now vacant. A 
freeze on hiring was part of the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Final budget approval and a vote on the two fees is expected at the Aug. 7 
council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed fees would add about $35 to the annual tax bills of residential 
property owners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projected Revenue 
</P>
<P>
Chief Administrative Officer John Bramble said the lighting fee would generate 
about $120,000, with about $110,000 earmarked for electricity and the 
replacement of street light poles. The balance would cover the cost of 
establishing a lighting assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
Bramble said only the Cheli industrial area in the north end of the city is now 
being assessed for street lighting. If approved, the fee would be extended 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed sewer maintenance fee would be $7.47 for a residential property of 
five dwellings, or less on a single parcel. For commercial property and 
residential units with more than five dwellings the fee would be $44.82. Some 
high-use commercial properties, such as car washes, motels, self-service 
laundries, restaurants and wholesale meat companies, would be assessed $74.70. 
</P>
<P>
About $72,000 of the $80,000 raised from the sewer fee would be used to clean 
sewers, Bramble said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a buildup of sewage, rocks, grease, oil and illegally dumped paint," 
Bramble said. Funds have not been available to clean the sewer lines for 13 
years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the sewer and street lighting fees must be used for their stated purposes, 
Bramble said. Any surplus would be automatically extended as credit on the next 
year's assessment, whether for residential or commercial users. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jay Price told the audience that the $35 "was what you can spend in 
one night of going out to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the financial woes facing the city, everyone at the meeting was angry 
about the proposed fees. Some said they doubted that they would see any 
tangible results in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lights out because gang members go out shooting them. They should try 
to get who is doing it and make them do community service. I have observed 
about three different lights being shot out on Randolph (Street)," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to have a separate bill (for the new fees) and not have them put it 
on my tax bill," said John Smith, another Bell resident. "If I have to pay for 
rubbish and lighting and sewage, fine. But not on my taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Robinson, a Bell resident since 1940, agreed that too many years have 
passed since the sewers have been cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
"And as far as a complete thing of $35 a year, it isn't much really," said 
Robinson, in arguing against the fees. "But if they can tack on $35 a year, 
what would keep them from tacking on $300 the next year?" 
</P>
<P>
"Jay Price says everyone goes out (to dinner) for $35," Wade said. "If my 
husband and I go out for dinner we can't spend $10. I feel as though the 
council is just not listening to the people."

CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS CHEER DEFEAT OF SIGN LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge's recent ruling that a Pomona ordinance requiring the use of 
English characters on business signs was unconstitutional was hailed as a 
victory for the area's Asian population by leaders of civil rights groups this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which a group of Asian business owners challenged in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles earlier this year, required that all business 
signs with foreign characters devote 50% of the space to English characters. It 
was passed by a unanimous vote of the City Council last year. 
</P>
<P>
Federal District Judge Robert Takasugi ruled the ordinance was unconstitutional 
because it discriminated on the basis of national origin and it limited freedom 
of speech. 
</P>
<P>
"This ordinance was clearly an attack by the city of Pomona on its growing 
Asian community," said Robin Toma, an attorney with the American Civil 
Liberties Union, which filed a brief in support of the plaintiff. "By attacking 
the use of the Asian alphabets in signs, rather than attacking the use of any 
foreign language, the city was sending out a clear signal to the Asian 
community, telling them that their culture is not welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Toma said the ACLU is considering suing other cities with similar ordinances 
requiring the use of English, including San Gabriel, Arcadia, Rosemead, and 
Temple City. Some officials in those cities are already considering the 
implications of the court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Mayor John Tapp said that "in light of the court ruling I'm sure 
we'll have to review" the city's ordinance, which is virtually identical to 
Pomona's. Twenty percent of San Gabriel's population is Asian, Tapp said, and 
"a substantial number" of businesses have not complied with the ordinance, 
which was passed in March. 
</P>
<P>
In his July 14 decision, Takasugi ruled that the ordinance violates the equal 
protection clause of the 14th Amendment because it "expressly discriminates 
against sign owners who use foreign alphabetical characters in their signs. The 
use of foreign languages is clearly an expression of national origin." The 
ordinance also obstructs freedom of cultural expression, the judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, who proposed the ordinance, denied it was 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
"It had nothing to do with that," he said. "It didn't single out any racial 
origin. It just said, 'Hey, in Pomona our people and our public services should 
know what businesses to locate.' I wouldn't want to live in a community where I 
need an interpreter to tell me about the country I was born in." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Nell Soto said she was surprised the ordinance was struck down 
because it "does not take away their right to print their language. It asks 
them to include English." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer hired to represent Pomona in the case, Alan Yamada, said city 
officials have not decided whether they will appeal the ruling. The judge is 
still considering the plaintiff's claim that there was intentional bias in the 
ordinance, and the city is seeking to settle the claim out of court, Yamada 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the ruling on Pomona businesses is unclear in a community where 
only 2.7% of the population is Asian, according to the 1980 Census. Although 
city officials say that all business signs comply with the ordinance, the 
attorney for the Asian group, Elizabeth Brancart, said there are a few signs in 
Pomona that use only foreign characters. Brancart refused to identify those 
signs and would not disclose the names of her clients, but said most of them 
are Pomona business owners. 
</P>
<P>
Hoa Binh Market, a Chinese grocery store on East Holt Avenue, is one of a 
handful of stores that cater to the Asian community in Pomona. Doreen Han, 
assistant manager, said the market was not involved in the suit but she 
believed the law was unfair "because it's my personal right to express what I 
want to. Sometimes you want to express (something) only in Chinese." But, she 
added, the business signs in front of the market contain both Chinese and 
English because "our customers are not only Chinese. We have Filipinos, 
Americans, a mixture of different nationalities." 
</P>
<P>
J Craig Fong, a lawyer with the Asian Pacific Legal Center in Los Angeles, has 
been monitoring the enforcement of the Pomona ordinance and a similar one in 
Monterey Park. Fong said the decision sends a signal to cities that "these 
communities are changing, and (city officials) need to find some other solution 
to the difficulties they seem to be having with foreign businesses." 
</P>
<P>
In Monterey Park, where Asians constitute slightly more than half of the 
population, every business sign must include an explanation, in English, of the 
name or the nature of the establishment. In some cases both the name and type 
of business must be on the sign, but the law does not prohibit the use of a 
foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
The passage of the ordinance in 1986 followed a bitter campaign by longtime 
Monterey Park residents who were concerned about a large influx of Asian 
immigrants and lobbied for laws requiring the use of English. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said Pomona's ordinance was designed to prevent the city from being 
transformed into another Monterey Park or Alhambra, where "the whole downtown 
is plastered with Oriental signs that no one can understand. There's some 
resentment to that."

DESPITE 24 NEW ROOMS, HIGH SCHOOL IS JAMMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SOUTH GATE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 400 students who were bused to other schools last year to relieve 
overcrowded conditions at South Gate High School have returned to 24 newly 
constructed classrooms and found their old year-round campus as crowded as 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
Due to an increase in the number of new students, school officials are dealing 
with the same old overcrowding headaches. 
</P>
<P>
The cafeteria is always filled to capacity. Hallway and physical education 
lockers are shared by as many as three students. Five minutes have been added 
to the school day to fit in all of the school's activities, according to 
Assistant Principal Howard Lappin. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasing student population, school officials predict that by 
the next school year more than 400 will be bused to other schools to relieve 
the crowded conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't build fast enough," said Rodger Friermuth, the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's project manager for school planning. 
</P>
<P>
There is no more room to construct buildings on the 56-year-old campus that was 
built to accommodate 1,600 students, Friermuth said. 
</P>
<P>
In a continuing effort to relieve overcrowded conditions in the predominantly 
Latino campus, the district is proposing to build a regional high school in an 
industrial area of the city. However, ground contamination in the area under 
consideration must be cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
It could be more than five years before a new high school is constructed, 
Friermuth said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988-89 academic year, a total of 3,186 students attended the three 
different tracks or semester sessions at South Gate High. This year, the 
1989-90 school period, officials estimate that the total will jump to 3,700 by 
the time the last track starts in September. 
</P>
<P>
Because two tracks simultaneously attend classes, there are nearly 2,500 
students on campus at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
"The new classrooms will not stop busing," Lappin said. "By 1990, we'll 
probably be busing as many students as we did last year." 
</P>
<P>
The school has been busing students for more than eight years because of 
crowded conditions. 
</P>
<P>
During 1988-89, an estimated 600 students were bused to four different schools 
in the Los Angeles district, including Palisades High School in Pacific 
Palisades. The three other schools were in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students Given Choice 
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the 24 new classrooms, which cost $3.2 million to build, 
the 400 students being bused were given a choice of returning to South Gate 
High or remaining in other schools. 
</P>
<P>
Of the students being bused last year, only 200, mostly seniors, chose not to 
return, Lappin said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Teresa Casillas, 17, was one senior who did come back. An overcrowded 
South Gate High was a welcome relief to Casillas and the other returning 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of getting up at 4 a.m. to ride the bus," said Casillas, who was 
bused more than 30 miles to Palisades High School. 
</P>
<P>
Anxious to be closer to her South Gate home, Casillas gave up her summer 
vacation to enroll at South Gate High, which started a new semester July 3. 
</P>

"Sharing lockers with two other students," Casillas said, is better than 
getting up before dawn for the long bus rides. 
</P>
<P>
Casillas said she missed a lot of school because she was unable to get up in 
time to catch the bus.

<P>
South Gate High School hired 28 new teachers who also suffer from a degree of 
overcrowding, said Carol Burke, another assistant principal. They lack simple 
things such as enough mail boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers line up at the library Xerox machine as early as 7 a.m. to duplicate 
material before classes begin at 7:25 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Parking is also a problem because part of the teachers' parking lot is being 
used as a student eating area.

COUNCILMAN HOPES TO REVIVE PROPOSAL FOR WASTE-TO-ENERGY PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wearing a hard hat, business suit and bulldog expression that made him look 
like a demanding plant inspector, Glendale City Councilman Carl Raggio nodded 
approvingly as a garbage truck dumped its load at an incinerator pit in the 
City of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Raggio sighed admiringly as a giant crane lifted three tons of garbage from the 
pit and sent it rolling down a chute to the plant's furnace. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to Glendale Public Works Director George Miller, the councilman 
solemnly pronounced: "This is the wave of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Raggio and Miller were touring the waste-to-energy plant in Commerce -- one of 
two in the Los Angeles basin -- on Friday. The visit was a symbolic first step 
toward reviving the councilman's dream of solving Glendale's refuse problems by 
building a state-of-the-art incinerator complex in the city's Scholl Canyon 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
But Raggio's opponents say they are ready and waiting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opponents Steadfast 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce plant, they say, which was built as a showcase of waste-to-energy 
technology, has proven only that incinerators cause serious pollution problems, 
and the opponents say they will never allow another incinerator plant in 
southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago a city report recommended a feasibility study for an incinerator 
in Glendale, but the proposal never got off the ground. Weeks later a 
much-publicized plan to build a giant incinerator was defeated in South-Central 
Los Angeles, and the Scholl Canyon project was quietly put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for similar projects throughout the region quickly followed suit, 
crumbling one after another in the face of public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Raggio is back on the offensive. As he sees it, the political storm 
raised by incinerator foes has passed, and Glendale can wait no longer to 
address its looming garbage crisis. With less than 20 years of life left in the 
city's landfill, and other dump sites in the region filling even faster, the 
time has come to reopen the incinerator debate. 
</P>
<P>
If only politicians, environmentalists and "the liberal lawyers" at the state 
regulatory agencies would give incinerators a chance, Raggio reasons, they 
would solve the garbage problem of the entire Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
Only four years ago, more than two dozen incinerators were proposed throughout 
California, and the giant waste-to-energy project in Vernon in South-Central 
Los Angeles had received Mayor Tom Bradley's blessing. The incinerators, 
boosters proclaimed, would reduce mountains of rubbish to piles of ash. And as 
a side benefit, the plants would generate electric power for sale to local 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
But although nearly 100 plants have been built in other states and hundreds 
more in Europe and Asia, pollution-conscious Californians quickly galvanized 
grass-roots opposition and killed off most of the projects before they were 
constructed. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious reversal came in June, 1987, when Bradley, sensing the 
changing political climate, changed his position and opposed the Vernon 
project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Decision 
</P>
<P>
It was a political decision that enraged Raggio, an aerospace engineer at Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada and a firm believer that technology properly 
applied can lead to environmentally safe solutions. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Vernon project was defeated because Los Angeles Councilwoman Gloria 
Molina "made a career out of telling people that the incinerator would pollute 
their neighborhood, but these people don't know what they're talking about. 
Waste-to-energy plants produce less pollution than car emissions in a mile of 
highway." 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce plant burns 350 tons of garbage a day, and produces enough 
electricity for 20,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Don Avila, a spokesman for the County Sanitation Districts in charge of 
operating the Commerce plant, shares Raggio's distaste for the strong-arm 
tactics he claims are used against waste-to-energy projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in age where voters are very sophisticated," he said, "and they 
realize how easy it is to get something closed by going to elected officials 
and telling them, 'Guess what? You do this and you will be recalled,' so the 
politician says, 'Maybe I ought to back down on this one and try something 
different.' " 
</P>
<P>
With the debate simmered down somewhat since the Vernon battle, Raggio believes 
the time has come to reintroduce his incinerator proposal. "I don't think we 
can wait any longer, with our landfill almost full. We can't push back any 
further our search for alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
Raggio envisions building four incinerators at Scholl Canyon, each burning 300 
tons a day of refuse -- enough to provide almost every household in the city 
with electricity and reduce the landfill's daily intake of 2,500 tons per day 
almost by half. 
</P>
<P>
Such a project, Raggio acknowledged, would cost the city hundreds of millions 
of dollars to build. But part of the complex, he said, could be funded by an 
increase in tipping fees, the money paid to Glendale by 10 cities that dump 
their refuse in Scholl Canyon. The rest could be paid by municipal bonds, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Recovery Seen 
</P>
<P>
Raggio calculates that the incinerators would recover their start-up costs in 
less than five years. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will ask Miller, the public works director, to resume the 
feasibility study recommended in the 1987 report by early next year, as soon as 
the city completes the gas collection system replacement under way in Scholl 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
All four of Raggio's City Council colleagues said Tuesday they favor Raggio's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But whether waste-to-energy plants are health hazards remains a question. South 
Coast Air Quality Management District officials in charge of monitoring the 
Commerce plant cited the plant last year for "repeated violations of district 
rules concerning mass emissions of air pollutants," said Robert Pease, an AQMD 
senior engineering manager. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that AQMD standards are too stringent and that the Commerce 
incinerator's pollution level is marginal compared to other waste disposal 
solutions, plant officials appealed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD hearing board granted the plant a variance to continue operating, but 
the AQMD has appealed the board's decision, and a final ruling is expected at a 
hearing scheduled for next month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough for incinerator plants to meet our standards," said Pease, "but not 
impossible." An incinerator plant in compliance with AQMD standards would not 
be entirely pollution-free, he explained, but the health risk would be so small 
that "it would not pose a threat to the surrounding community." 
</P>
<P>
Wil Baca, spokesman for the California Alliance in Defense of Residential 
Environments (DARE) -- which was formed to oppose incinerators in the Los 
Angeles basin -- believes the AQMD findings at the Commerce plant are reason 
enough to shelve any further attempt to build similar facilities in the region. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plant Criticized 
</P>
<P>
"The commerce facility ought to serve as a big history lesson," he said. "It 
has demonstrated quite adequately that it can't meet current requirements for 
controlling emissions in the basin. If they can't meet standards set forth in 
1987, when the plant was built, it's even more improbable that a new plant will 
meet the much more stringent standards in place today." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Baca said a new incinerator plant would be economically unfeasible 
because a state law requires Southern California Edison Co. to pay the Commerce 
plant a high price for its electricity -- currently more than three times the 
market rate -- but the state no longer subsidizes new incinerator projects. 
Even so, Baca pointed out, the Commerce plant operates in the red. 
</P>
<P>
Avila acknowledged that the Commerce plant is paid a high rate for its 
electricity and is not a profitable operation, but trash disposal, he argues, 
is a problem that transcends economics. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of a single recycling program in the U.S. that doesn't lose 
money, but nobody complains," said Avila. "Recycling is necessary to offset the 
impact of landfilling and of truck-hauling trash. Waste-to-energy is the same 
thing. Shouldn't it be subsidized if it's necessary to solve a regional or even 
national problem?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispute Likely 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more troublesome to Glendale, however, is the political showdown 
the incinerator proposal is likely to generate. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how Raggio thinks he can move that kind of project," Baca said. 
"He can expect at least 15 organizations that I know of camping on his doorstep 
the minute he makes a serious proposal." 
</P>
<P>
While Raggio said he expects some opposition from the "Greenpeace types that 
come to demonstrations driving beat-up Volkswagens that put out more pollutants 
than the projects they complain about," Scholl Canyon's community leaders say 
they are willing to give the councilman a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware of the shortage of landfill sites in the area," said David Weaver, 
president of the Glenoaks Canyon Homeowners Assn., formerly the Scholl Canyon 
Homeowners Assn. "Building an incinerator is the most logical solution, as long 
as it doesn't release pollutants in the air -- and technology indicates it can 
be done." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Bridges, the association's vice president, said: "I know a lot of people 
are emotional about incinerators, but I don't know enough about it. I do think 
it's worth looking at the possibility." 
</P>
<P>
If there were no environmental problems, he said, "it sure would help. We're 
running out of landfill space, and we need an alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Other local homeowners may not be so receptive to Raggio's proposal. "At this 
point I would be opposed to an incinerator because there are too many 
unanswered questions," said Chris Rudd, who also sits on the homeowner 
association's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"If the people in South-Central L.A. turned it down, it must be for some 
reason. The council will have to work very hard to convince me that the 
incinerator will not contaminate the air we breathe."

About 100 angry parents and supporters held a peaceful demonstration Wednesday 
as students were bused away from Park Avenue Elementary School, which was 
closed after an oily substance seeped into the schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the protesting parents said they were keeping their children home 
because they feared for the students' safety at their new campus, Russell 
Elementary School in South-Central Los Angeles, which some parents said is in a 
gang area. Other parents said they wanted the children to remain in their home 
neighborhood and were opposed to the seven-mile bus ride. 
</P>
<P>
School officials told parents that students would be safe and that Russell does 
not have a gang problem. Some teachers and administrators from Russell also 
were on hand to greet the students. Russell, which is on a traditional school 
calendar, was closed for the summer. Park Avenue School is on a year-round 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
There were 650 students scheduled to be moved. However, 244 failed to show up. 
Twenty-three were absent because of illness. There were 335 first- through 
sixth-grade students taken to Russell and 84 pre-kindergarten and kindergarten 
students taken to Clara Street School about three blocks from Park Avenue 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said students will remain at Russell and Clara schools during the 
summer. Officials said they will seek other locations for the students while 
Park Avenue School is closed for an investigation into the source of a 
mysterious, oily substance that has seeped up through the school's asphalt 
playground. LEE HARRIS

SHOWDOWN LOOMS OVER WESTWOOD HOTEL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the dust barely settled on a hard-fought development plan for Westwood 
Village, homeowners who had agreed to allow construction of a hotel in the 
village say they have found a glitch in the plan that could kill the project. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and the city's highest-ranking 
zoning official insist that the discovery does not jeopardize the proposed 
350-room hotel. The disagreement sets the stage for a showdown among the 
homeowners, Los Angeles city officials, hotel developers and the owners of a 
former UCLA dormitory that is at the center of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
This week, three Westwood homeowner groups hired an attorney and formally 
appealed a ruling by Zoning Administrator Franklin P. Eberhard that allows the 
hotel on a Glendon Avenue parking lot near Bullock's department store. The 
homeowners argue that the hotel should not be permitted because it would 
violate a cap on hotel construction included in the village plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Zoning Code 
</P>
<P>
The plan, adopted by the City Council in December after four years of 
sometimes-stormy community debate, limits the number of hotel rooms in Westwood 
Village to 350. Although it generally had been assumed that the provision would 
allow Nansay Corp. to build a hotel on its Glendon Avenue parking lot, the 
homeowner groups now say the room limit has already been surpassed. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that a former student dormitory on Tiverton Avenue that was 
converted in the early 1970s into a residential hotel for the elderly should be 
considered a hotel under the village plan. The owners of the building, known as 
Westwood Horizons, agree and have joined the homeowners in challenging 
Eberhard's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"They absolutely consider them selves a hotel," said Kenneth B. Bley, an 
attorney representing owner David Roberts. "It is now, and always has been, a 
hotel under the zoning code." 
</P>
<P>
There are conflicting claims as to the size of Westwood Horizons. The 
building's 1966 certificate of occupancy lists 492 guest rooms, a number the 
homeowners say is accurate. Eberhard's report states there are 294 rooms, and 
Bley said the 13-story building has about 300 rooms. An aide to Yaroslavsky 
said the number is closer to 390. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of its size, city officials say they never intended to include 
Westwood Horizons in the calculation of allowable hotel rooms. Yaroslavsky said 
"everybody knew" that the 350-room limit, which had been reduced from 700 
during negotiations, was calculated with the Nansay project in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"In the years we spent on the plan, no issue dominated the discussion as much 
as the hotel site," Yaroslavsky said. "It was the most contentious issue of the 
bunch. Now, for anyone to come forward and say we didn't mean a new hotel is 
disingenuous." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Snyder, a member of the Westwood Design Review Board that must approve the 
Nansay project, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Question Mark' 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding of the plan was that it would allow 350 new hotel rooms," he 
said. "Even though I may not like the hotel, it was what we all agreed to." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood, one of the groups challenging the 
new hotel, said the homeowners did not raise the issue of Westwood Horizons 
during negotiations on the plan because they did not know that it was a hotel. 
Various city records, including the 1966 certificate of occupancy, classify the 
building as a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a question mark in our mind, and we let it ride," Lake said. "We can't 
do everything. We are volunteers in this community and there are a lot of fires 
to put out." 
</P>
<P>
Lake agreed that the proposed Glendon Avenue hotel development "was one of the 
sore points" in negotiations over the village plan, and she acknowledged that 
she and other homeowners eventually supported a compromise allowing 350 rooms. 
But the discovery that Westwood Horizons is a hotel has changed the picture, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We said we would support a hotel, but if there is a hotel already, we are left 
in a predicament," Lake said. "We don't want to be overdeveloped with hotels. 
Our concern has always been not to get swamped. We felt the city was permitting 
way too many rooms." 
</P>
<P>
If Westwood Horizons were to convert to a conventional hotel operation, Lake 
said the homeowners fear that the village could end up with two hotels with 
double the allowable 350 rooms. Bley said Roberts has no plans to convert the 
building "in the immediate future," but Yaroslavsky said Roberts told him that 
he would like to convert it "at some point in the future." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ruling Allows Project 
</P>
<P>
After being alerted to the dispute by Yaroslavksy, Eberhard issued a five-page 
opinion on July 7 that argues the room limit in the village plan, known 
officially as the Westwood Village Specific Plan, applies only to new hotel 
construction. Eberhard's ruling allows the Nansay project to proceed and it 
prohibits Roberts from converting Westwood Horizons without special city 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both the homeowners and Roberts dispute Eberhard's authority to 
rule in the matter, saying the city attorney's office should review it. But it 
is Eberhard's opinion that they have formally appealed to the city's Board of 
Zoning Appeals, which is expected to schedule a hearing in the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Eberhard said that Westwood Horizons is an "apartment hotel" 
that rents on a monthly rather than daily basis and does not pay the so-called 
bed tax that conventional hotels pay. If the building were converted, he said, 
the new operation would be subject to city laws governing hotels, including one 
that prohibits them within 500 feet of residential neighborhoods without 
special approval. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Hummer, an attorney for Nansay, said the Santa Monica firm is moving 
ahead with the hotel project, which also includes retail shops and 
condominiums. This week, the company began showing community leaders a model of 
the tiered complex, which will cover four acres and extend as high as eight 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
"Nansay has spent a tremendous amount of time and effort to date in its 
internal design competition to arrive at a project that is sensitive and 
complies with both the letter and the spirit of the Westwood Village Specific 
Plan," Hummer said. 
</P>
<P>
Lake cautioned that it is too early to predict whether Nansay or Roberts will 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
"When we supported the plan, we were supporting a first-class hotel in the 
village," Lake said. "The question now is whose hotel is it going to be. This 
is really a judgment call -- a legal question."

SLAVKIN ATTACKS SCHOOL DISTRICT BUREAUCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying the school district bureaucracy is "wholly dysfunctional," Westside's 
new representative to the Los Angeles school board told a small, supportive 
audience Tuesday that he would attack the district's "sacred cows" and its 
stifling system. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, "what started as a creative idea . . . just gets totally mucked up 
by our system," Mark Slavkin said at a Tuesday night town meeting in Los 
Angeles. The district, he said, is "on the verge of total collapse and 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour session at Hamilton High School drew 11 parents, teachers and 
administrators. Many of them had voted for him; some had even posted his 
campaign signs on their lawns or made phone calls for his election. 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin, who took office July 1, said it was the first of monthly community 
meetings he will hold throughout the Westside district, which includes about 80 
schools from Topanga Canyon and West Hollywood to Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin, 27, is on leave from his job as an aide to Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman while he determines whether his school board position 
will allow him time to do anything else, he said. "It's really become a 
full-time job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin won 51% of the votes cast in a runoff election June 6 to defeat 
incumbent Alan Gershman. During his campaign, he pledged to "shake up the 
fat-cat administrators and bureaucrats" and was backed by United Teachers-Los 
Angeles, which considers him a sympathetic fourth vote on the seven-member 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin this week proposed to the school board that the teachers, counselors, 
nurses and others who are represented by UTLA vote on whether they should be 
required to join the union or at least pay dues. They are now required to do 
neither, but all 32,000 of them -- 22,000 of whom are union members and 10,000 
are not -- will get the wage increase of 24% over three years won by the union. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is one of fairness, he said, likening it to taxes. "It's really not 
fair to say, 'I don't want to pay taxes, but I want police and fire 
protection,' " Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Slavkin also said UTLA has to become more dedicated to education 
reform and students and "less dedicated to a war machine fighting the district, 
banging heads." 
</P>
<P>
And when teachers at the meeting said they were "tired of covering up" for 
incompetent colleagues, Slavkin urged that the processes for evaluating and 
firing teachers be streamlined. If problem teachers are not improving after 
they are given help, they should be dismissed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Burned-Out Teachers' 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of excellent teachers, but we got a lot of burned out 
teachers, and a lot of teachers who would do great if they felt supported," he 
said. "It's one of the sacred cows in the district." 
</P>
<P>
Parents said the Westside is getting a bum rap from people who live elsewhere 
who think the Westside is home solely to affluent students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The stereotype of what a Westside student is" is no longer true, said Merle 
Strauss, chairwoman of Palisades Complex, a group of parents, teachers and 
administrators. She and other parents noted that many students are being bused 
to the Westside from poor schools that get federal funding, but that the 
funding does not follow them. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Sleeper, a director in the district's educational evaluation office, said 
that a 20-year-old federal program grants funds to schools in low-income areas 
that have students with below-average test scores. But, he confirmed, the money 
does not follow the students. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the law was initially intended, it was part of the war on poverty, 
geared to these schools in poverty areas. . . . It doesn't have the flexibility 
that people might have imagined." 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin said that instead of shipping students from overcrowded schools, 
schools should be built in those neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Slavkin said, the district has "driven people away who can 
afford to get away." After the meeting, he explained that many Westside parents 
who feel the district has been unresponsive have sent their children to private 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin said that in his 3 1/2 weeks in office, he was disturbed by the 
"micromanagement" of the board, which has included approving such picayune 
items as field trips that already happened and a $3.39 bill on a construction 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is . . . set up to guard against disasters," he said, charging that 
"you don't get the opposite -- innovation, exciting ideas, risk-takers, 
creativity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pink Memoes Abound 
</P>
<P>
"If a plane landed on a school, the response at the top would be: Who is the 
principal at that school? Don't we have a policy against this? Why were those 
kids out on the playground? . . . And then a pink memo to every school site 
saying, 'In the future, you must know the plane schedule in your area, and kids 
must never be on the playground, and there'll be an in-service for teachers 
next Saturday, because when the plane did crash, these teachers were not 
equipped to deal with it,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin added that he wanted to see the new "shared decision-making" councils 
at schools take strong roles. The councils, provided for in the teachers' 
contract, will be established at all schools this fall. Composed of teachers, 
parents, administrators and community leaders, they will make decisions on 
spending, scheduling, student discipline and use of equipment -- previously the 
realms of principals. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the board's intergovernmental relations committee, Slavkin said 
he would work to resolve the district's "credibility problem" represented by 
the district's initially claiming that $80 million in cuts were needed but 
ultimately granting 8% wage increases over three years to teachers and 
administrators with only $43 million in cuts. 
</P>
<P>
He is also the chairman of the personnel and schools committee and a member of 
the building committee. 
</P>
<P>
Other duties include sitting on the business operations committee, which 
oversees the district's spending. "It may not sound as glamorous, but . . . (it 
involved) $20 million worth of milk last year, $8 million worth of burritos," 
he said.

ANGRY RESIDENTS MOBILIZE TO OUST DYMALLY DAUGHTER

<TEXT>
<P>
A petition drive has been launched by angry residents to remove Lynn 
Dymally-Lee, daughter of U. S. Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-Compton), from the 
Compton Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the petition drive are angry because the school board appointed 
Dymally-Lee without public notification. She was appointed earlier this month 
to fill the vacancy created when Trustee Bernice Woods resigned to take a seat 
on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"By appointing Lynn Dymally-Lee, they're making a statement to the citizens," 
said Patricia A. Moore, the mother of two and a city employee who has filed to 
run in the November school board election. "They're saying, 'We don't care what 
you think.' " (Moore is not related to the city councilwoman of the same name.) 
</P>
<P>
Acquanetta Warren, another parent who is considering running for the board, 
said board members "have a responsibility to hear what other people have to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
John Taylor, former Compton High School mathematics teacher, said: "They 
agendized the swearing in. They did not agendize the appointment." 
</P>
<P>
Dymally-Lee was appointed at the July 11 meeting on a 4-2 vote. She was sworn 
in at the board meeting Tuesday night while backers of the petition drive were 
holding a press conference outside. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Correa, one of the four trustees who voted to appoint Dymally-Lee, said 
the district was "fortunate to have that talented person available" to fill the 
vacancy. The last time Dymally-Lee served on the board, Correa said, she was a 
"very competent board member, was a very thoughtful person who got along with 
all segments of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Correa said he did not know whether Dymally-Lee would run in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally-Lee was elected to a four-year term on the board in 1983 but did not 
seek reelection. She could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"She elected not to come back," said Margaret Moore, another candidate for the 
board, who has run before. Moore works for the school district as a community 
liaison but said she will resign if elected. 
</P>
<P>
Earnest Spears, executive director of the Compton Chamber of Commerce, who is 
also running for election to the board, says politics was the deciding factor 
in the Dymally-Lee appointment. 
</P>
<P>
When she served on the board, critics said Dymally-Lee was part of her father's 
effort to build a political machine in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The board "had an obligation to choose the most qualified person. What made her 
more qualified than anybody else?" Spears asked. 
</P>
<P>
Spears also charged that Dymally-Lee does not live in the city but lives in 
Huntington Park on Seville Avenue. There is a telephone listing for William 
Lee, her husband, at that address and the voice on the telephone answering 
machine identifies herself as Lynn Dymally-Lee. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials said they did not have a work number for her and did 
not know her home address or where she was registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law voters in the district have 30 days to gather about 870 
signatures on petitions to force the board to rescind the appointment. The seat 
would then remain vacant until the November election when four other seats will 
also be contested.

GLENDALE STUDIES LAND-USE IN EFFORT TO CAP POPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a new attempt to resolve how to limit Glendale's population to no more than 
220,000 as recommended in the General Plan, the Glendale City Council on 
Tuesday earmarked $40,000 to hire a private company to conduct a land use 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
The survey would identify areas of the city now zoned for apartments but 
predominantly occupied by single homes where residents could voluntarily agree 
to have their neighborhoods reclassified for single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The survey will also determine the average number of people per household, and 
provide a clearer picture of how many housing units the city can tolerate 
before exceeding its desired population ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
The council has been divided over what zoning restrictions should be adopted to 
keep the city's population from skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jerold Milner and council members Carl Raggio and Ginger Bremberg 
proposed cutting the potential for apartment construction by half. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilmen Dick Jutras and Larry Zarian have opposed this solution, 
contending that it is too drastic and would drive property prices beyond the 
reach of all but a few. 
</P>
<P>
Zarian and Jutras said Tuesday that the land-use survey will help them identify 
alternative ways of complying with the population limits without imposing 
severe zoning restrictions on apartment and condominium owners.

YOUR PROPERTY RIGHTS: HOW TO PROTECT THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monterey Park, where are you going? 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, I hear accusations of bribery, observe traffic problems, businesses 
changing, concerns about store signs, controversy in choosing a new police 
chief, chaotic City Council meetings, citizens being denied the opportunity to 
address an issue and now the council's plan to reduce building -- after, long 
after the issue should have been resolved. ("Monterey Park Rejects Plan to 
Change Zoning in Residential Areas," Times, April 27.) 
</P>
<P>
Some of the council members' solutions are to downzone property, change 
property definitions and other thoughts. Are there more equitable alternatives? 
Personally I can't afford the losses that would occur if the present plans were 
adopted. And, I wonder how many other Monterey Park property owners (I have 
owned property in Monterey Park for 29 years) can afford to lose the value of 
their property. I can't and I feel that some council members are impervious and 
insensitive to their constituents and to the losses that could occur if any of 
their present plans are implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Why does the council have "continued meetings" or "recessed meetings" about 
issues that drastically affect property or people without adequate 
notification. Posted notification is legal but not always adequate. Is there 
something to hide? 
</P>
<P>
Some civic-minded people are part of several different groups in the city to 
ensure citizen representation and to protect their property. They have found it 
necessary to monitor the Planning Commission and City Council meetings to 
protect their rights and investments. 
</P>
<P>
You can do the following: 
</P>
<P>
1. Write or call City Council members and inform them about your concerns for 
property downzoning, changing the definitions of the zoning code or whatever 
other plan is being proposed. Your property value will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
2. Attend the City Council meeting on Aug. 14 to protect your property. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, there is little help after a decision has been made and you have to 
live with the decision. Join us to protect our property rights and to ensure 
that our property values will be upheld.

SCHOOLS SEEK COORDINATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District has established a new 
administrative position to coordinate bilingual education and other programs 
for students who speak limited English. 
</P>
<P>
The school board on Monday approved the post, with an annual salary of $43,246 
to $50,592. The coordinator will work with bilingual and English as a Second 
Language teachers and review curricula and textbooks, said Francine Geldwachs, 
director of curriculum and staff development. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Geldwachs and a teacher on special assignment oversaw the bilingual 
and ESL programs, Geldwachs said. The coordinator position was created because 
"the programs have grown, and they're important to the district," she said. 
</P>
<P>
About 17% of the district's 9,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade 
have limited proficiency in English, Geldwachs said. 
</P>
<P>
Job applications are available at the district offices, 1651 16th St. or by 
calling (213) 450-8338, Ext. 274. They are due Aug. 14.

SAVE OUR BEACH PETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Save Our Beach Committee last week submitted a petition with more than 10,000 
signatures for an initiative that would ban all new beachfront hotels and 
restaurants larger than 2,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The county registrar-recorder has 30 days to verify the signatures. At least 
8,420 are needed to qualify. If the initiative qualifies, the City Council must 
adopt the initiative or place the issue on the ballot in a special election 
within 88 to 103 days. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Gilpin, a spokeswoman for the committee, said 65 people collected the 
10,000 signatures over 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would ban all new hotel construction, including a luxury hotel 
proposed by restaurateur Michael McCarty on the site of the private Sand and 
Sea Club on Pacific Coast Highway, and one being planned by Maguire Thomas 
Partners on Ocean Avenue next to the recently opened Loews Santa Monica Beach 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Another group is circulating a petition for a competing initiative that would 
ban new beachfront hotels for three years, but exempt the McCarty and Maguire 
Thomas projects. It began collecting signatures earlier this month. This 
initiative would use a portion of beachfront hotel bed taxes to clean up Santa 
Monica Bay and city parks. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the group, Santa Monicans for a Livable Environment, said 
they expect to collect between 10,000 and 12,000 signatures by Aug. 1.

KELL MAKES APPOINTMENTS TO 3 CIVIC COMMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Ernie Kell has reappointed one member of the Long Beach Harbor Commission 
and extended the term of another, keeping the five-member panel intact for at 
least another year. 
</P>
<P>
Kell announced this week that he would not replace Commissioner Louise DuVall, 
an attorney, citing the need to "maintain the direction and stability of the 
port." Instead, she will remain in her spot for about another year before any 
change is considered again, Kell said. 
</P>
<P>
DuVall, who has been on the commission since 1979, will serve as its president 
this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week approved the mayor's reappointment of David L. 
Hauser, a real estate agent, to a second six-year term on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also gave the go-ahead to new appointments to the city's 
Redevelopment Agency board and Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Physician Judson R. Schoendorf and James R. Kennelly were appointed to 
four-year terms on the Redevelopment Agency board, which has five members. They 
replace Thomas E. Stewart, whose second term ended in May, and Msgr. Ernest 
Gualderon, whose second term officially ended in 1987 but was extended another 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Dentist Ebenezer Bush will serve a four-year term on the seven-member Planning 
Commission. He replaces Dr. Horace Rains, who served two terms.

DIGEST: BOARD OF EDUCATION ELECTS ITS FIRST LATINO PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach Board of Education has elected its first Latino president. She 
is Jenny Oropeza, 31, a professional political aide who just completed her 
freshman year on the board. The action was taken as Harriet Williams, a board 
member since 1979, concluded her one-year term as president. Karin Polacheck, 
another freshman member, was elected board vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was the only member of the previous board to survive last year's 
switch from citywide elections to elections by geographical district. Oropeza, 
who represents the area including downtown Long Beach, the central area, Signal 
Hill and part of the east side, was swept into office along with other 
first-timers Polacheck, Jerry Shultz and Bobbie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Oropeza had served as board vice president under Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The board asked its staff to prepare a recommendation for consideration later 
this summer that would establish a line of succession by which future board 
vice presidents would automatically ascend to the presidency.

MANNERS HEADS GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilwoman Nancy Manners has been elected president of the 44-member 
Independent Cities Assn., a collective municipal lobbying and regional planning 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California association, an amalgam of small- and medium-sized 
cities, addresses regional issues, often pooling resources to combat problems. 
The group's efforts include a risk management authority that allows member 
cities to self-insure and a financing authority that allows cities to purchase 
capital equipment they otherwise could not afford. 
</P>
<P>
Manners' goals for the coming year include expanding the organization's 
political influence through better communication with the county and state 
officials. Also, Manners would like to add member cities to the 29-year-old 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Manners' appointment takes effect in September. Glendora Councilwoman Lois 
Shade also has been named as one of the organization's vice presidents.

RECYCLING PROGRAM OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The solution to limited landfill space is not to ban non-biodegradable 
packaging materials, but to encourage recycling, the City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Monday, the council agreed with a city task force that a ban on 
polystyrene and plastic packaging products containing ozone-damaging 
chlorofluorocarbons was unnecessary, said Dennis Danner, director of 
administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial chemical is no longer used by 99% of the nation's polystyrene 
manufacturers, industry officials told task force members. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of banning polystyrene, the city will begin a recycling program for 
1,000 homes in southeastern Alhambra, Danner said. The three-month pilot 
program, scheduled to begin Oct. 1, will offer residents curbside pickup of 
recyclable materials such as newspapers, bottles and cans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Polystyrene and plastic packaging products such as grocery bags and fast-food 
storage containers, which also can be recycled, "may perhaps be part of a 
citywide recycling program," Danner said.

WILLARD PARK -- DIVERSITY IS ITS KEY

<P>
Just north of the commercial and civic center of downtown Santa Ana lies the 
neighborhood that the city calls Willard Park, because of its close proximity 
to nearby Willard Elementary School on Washington Avenue and Ross Street. But 
probably most accurate is the description by Councilman Ron May, who represents 
the area. He labels it: "the inner city of the inner city." It's a neighborhood 
that has certainly changed in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The area holds vestiges of its past in the form of the single-story, white 
clapboard California bungalows that have defied the wrecking ball and still 
stand along French Street, and in its keeper of mementos, the Bowers Museum 
with its Spanish facade, located at the neighborhood's northern perimeter at 
the corner of Main and 20th streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The changes from the '40s to the late '80s have been unbelievable," says May, 
who has lived in the district all his life. He remembers that as a child his 
home was "surrounded by open fields and orange groves in the center of Santa 
Ana." 
</P>
<P>
Driving north along French Street from 8th Street the transitions are 
perceptible as the single-family bungalows become at 9th Street a three-story 
apartment complex only to become cottages again on the other side. At 
Washington Avenue the outcropping of apartment buildings comes in the form of a 
residential complex called Washington Square. 
</P>
<P>
Spurgeon Street "used to be a quiet residential street, with lots of trees," 
says Fran Dye, who has lived for the last 25 years in the first six-story 
high-rise built in Santa Ana. Now those old houses have been torn down. The new 
condominium and apartment complexes were perceived as filling a need felt by 
the growth of Orange County. But as the buildings accommodated more residents, 
the population of the area grew. 
</P>
<P>
The city responded in 1987 after the area had reached maximum density. Zoning 
has remained the same, but the general plan density decreased. Where there had 
been an allowance of 60 residential units per acre, there are now 35. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a moratorium on all high-rise complexes for the last few 
years," May reports. 
</P>
<P>
Condominiums in the area range in cost from $70,000 for one-bedroom apartments 
to a high of $130,000 for three-bedroom units, says Molly Doughty Minery of 
Santa Ana Realty. "Now Renting" reads the building at 17th Street and Broadway; 
at Washington Avenue and Flower Street, "Twenty Deluxe Apartments." 
</P>
<P>
Main Street running down its center is the neighborhood's commercial matrix; 
17th Street, at its northern border, a contender. During the daytime Trader 
Joe's, on Main at the corner of Washington Avenue, bustles with activity as 
does the Alpha Beta at the corner of 17th and Ross streets. But after dark it 
is the 24-hour Norm's, at the corner of 17th Street and Main, that draws and 
keeps the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Without contest, the Willard Park section of Santa Ana now features "the 
greatest ethnic and cultural diversity of any section of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
"The apartment complexes are filled not only with new arrivals but also with 
younger people who are not so affluent," May says. His perception as to 
affluence is correct, if understated. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the neighborhood is one of Orange County's poorest. Its median 
household income, around $13,000, is about one-third of the countywide figure; 
its per-capita number less than one-half the county standard. And 82% of 
Willard Park's households have incomes of less than $25,000 per year compared 
to 28% in the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of young families in those buildings (and) young professionals 
who are interested in close proximity to their work in the financial and legal 
areas and are drawn by the reasonable rents," May says. 
</P>
<P>
The area holds "many new residents as well as undocumented arrivals from other 
countries," he says. "Its a neighborhoood in transition in more than one 
direction, a boom on more than one front, very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Very exciting, perhaps, but not necessarily positive. Other residents complain 
that parking has become a problem, there's graffiti on the walls, and that 
rents are no longer affordable. 
</P>
<P>
And the styles of some apartment buildings and their residents are not to 
everyone's liking. Mrs. Dye says, "the apartment building next door is a blight

SHELL TO PAY $2.1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shell Oil Co. has agreed to pay the city $2.1 million to settle an eight-year 
legal dispute over franchise fees for an underground crude oil pipeline that 
runs through the city. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement clears the way for a new franchise agreement. City Atty. Robert 
M. Myers is recommending an annual fee of $12,000 for a new 20-year franchise 
for the 3.9-mile-long pipeline. The City Council is scheduled to hold a public 
hearing on the proposed franchise Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
The legal squabble began in 1981 when Shell's 40-year franchise expired. City 
officials recommended a new annual fee of $237,000, based on the market value 
of the land that the pipeline traveled through. 
</P>
<P>
Shell sued, contending that the fee was excessive and interfered with federal 
commerce. But the courts upheld the fee, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to 
review the case. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shell paid the city $1.7 million in back fees based on the new rate, 
but then filed a new suit to acquire an easement on the land the pipeline ran 
through and sought a trial to establish the value of the land. The city 
countersued for breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement agreement calls for both sides to drop all legal action.

<P>
MAJOR CRIMES UP 16% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Major crimes in West Covina -- including robbery, assault and theft -- have 
increased almost 16% over last year, according to Police Chief Craig Meacham's 
midyear report. 
</P>
<P>
As of June, however, there had been decreases in the number of rapes and 
burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
Meacham's report, given to the City Council at Monday's meeting, notes that a 
"correlation between substance abuse and major crimes can be established in the 
majority of cases." The second biggest factor causing the increase was a rise 
in street gang activity, Meacham said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest increase was in theft, which shot up 28% over the number of 
incidents last year. There has also been a 20% increase in the number of 
robberies, and a 6% increases in assaults and car thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the increased criminal activity, police have made 3,792 arrests, a 
12% increase over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Police response time has remained at a 4.9-minute average, considered excellent 
for a city the size of West Covina, according to other law enforcement 
officials. Over the last six months, police received a call for assistance 
every 16.9 minutes, every day of the week.

JOSEPH N. BELL: OPEN LETTER TO AN IMPRESSIVE EX-PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mr. Jimmy Carter 
</P>
<P>
Plains, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Mr. Carter: 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, we attended your Sunday school class at Maranatha Baptist Church 
in Plains. I don't suppose you remember us among the hundreds of tourists who 
show up at your service every year. My wife and I were wearing shorts -- which 
your Secret Service man and your pastor said was permissible -- and the 
11-year-old boy in our party paid surprising attention to what you were saying. 
We sat in the second row, and I asked you a question about whether or not you 
felt there is room for a diversity of interpretation in the Christian faith you 
represent so well. And you said there certainly is. I liked that. 
</P>
<P>
We were on our way from a week at Walt Disney World in Florida to a visit with 
dear friends in North Carolina. We came to Plains quite by accident -- when I 
noticed while studying the map in our motel room that it would be an easy side 
trip both to Plains and to the site of the Andersonville Civil War prison. We 
didn't even know it was Sunday -- a chronic condition among travelers -- when 
we arrived in Plains and were told by the Park Ranger at your museum that you 
were not only in town but would be teaching your Sunday School class. And so we 
came. 
</P>
<P>
To my wife and me, the hour we spent with you was the high spot of a two-week 
trip. It even rated right up there with my stepson in spite of some pretty 
heavy competition in both Florida and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived in Plains with a feeling of deep despair about our national leaders 
and the direction that leadership seems to be going: long on public relations, 
short on both substance and compassion. And, I must admit, we also arrived with 
a preconception that you had not been a strong president. But after an hour in 
your class, we came away in a state of wonder that a man with your convictions 
could actually have won that office and with a much deeper understanding of 
your difficulties in applying those convictions within the cynicism of the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
We also came away with an enormous wistfulness that the lesson of your defeat 
to professional politicians seems to be to give the American electorate the 
sizzle and to hell with the steak. 
</P>
<P>
In the process of teaching us about the book of Judges -- and you stuck 
admirably close to that subject -- you demonstrated three qualities that have 
been in short supply in the White House since you left: honest-to-God humility, 
intellectual acuity and a willingness to admit that in some areas you are still 
seeking answers. I thought your reply to a question about abortion was 
admirable: that your social instincts tell you that a woman should have the 
absolute right to control her own body and your gut feelings render that idea 
uncomfortable when it comes to abortion. Uncertainty that translates to 
open-mindedness is no longer allowed to be seen in the White House. And it was 
used against you when you were there. 
</P>
<P>
I was uncomfortable with some of your statements about being a "born-again 
Christian" when you were President. Fundamental Christianity makes me terribly 
uneasy in its black-and-white simplicity in a complex world. But after 
listening to you, I now understand that you were responding in a direct way to 
superficial questions that were never explored further. By applying biblical 
writings in your Sunday school lesson to some of the problems that faced you as 
President, you made it quite clear that the ethic you believe and practice 
leads to opening rather than closing the mind. 
</P>
<P>
You may recall that one of your local citizens mentioned our failure to permit 
prayer in the public schools as a sin, and you suggested rather gently that you 
didn't agree, explaining in a wonderfully clear and concise way the importance 
of not only preserving but protecting and supporting the religious and ethnic 
diversity of this country. 
</P>
<P>
So this letter is to thank you for sharing that hour with me and my family and 
for sidetracking me -- at least temporarily -- from a growing disaffection with 
the institutions that at present make up this society. 
</P>
<P>
As I sat there in your Sunday school class, I tried to imagine Richard Nixon or 
Lyndon Johnson or Ronald Reagan standing before us in such a situation, and, of 
course it didn't play at all. If there was one personal trait that caused 
problems for you as President, it was probably your disinclination to use power 
ruthlessly. But that same trait has clearly made it easy for you to give up the 
power of that office and resume life as a concerned private citizen, still 
following your own convictions. You don't just profess the importance and 
necessity in our society of helping the poor and powerless and needy, you do 
it. And you do it because -- quite simply -- you believe in it. 
</P>
<P>
We visited your library in Atlanta a few days after attending your class in 
Plains, and both my wife and I were struck by the emphasis on teaching young 
visitors about the history and power of the presidency. And the clear-eyed look 
the exhibits took with both the major thrusts of your Administration and the 
problems of putting them into practice -- particularly as they related to the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the American citizens kidnaped by Iran. The 
portion of your library labeled "Commitment to Human Rights" explained to me 
for the first time why you took the United States out of the 1980 Olympic 
Games. I may not agree, but at least I now understand and respect your 
reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
So thank you for demonstrating to me and my family that it is still possible -- 
or at least it was in 1976 -- for a man to achieve the presidency of the United 
States with a real commitment to respect and to encourage the rich diversity of 
our people and feel compassion for and give help to those in need without in 
any way compromising your own personal convictions. 
</P>
<P>
That's what we took away from your lesson on Judges. We won't forget it soon. 
</P>
<P>
Sincerely, 
</P>

SEWER FEES WILL JUMP FOR USERS OF CRESCENTA WATER DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monthly sewer service fees will more than double in September for about 23,000 
customers of the Crescenta Valley County Water District, officials announced 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The rate increase, which will boost monthly residential fees from $8.40 to $20, 
is needed to pay the community's share of the cost of improvements to the 
Hyperion sewage treatment plant in Los Angeles, said Robert K. Argenio, 
district general manager. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles is under federal and state mandates to complete by 1998 
an estimated $3.4 billion in improvements and additions to the Hyperion plant, 
part of a waste water treatment and disposal system that also serves seven 
other cities and several county water and sanitation districts. 
</P>
<P>
The Crescenta Valley district, like other users, has no voice in the 
improvement project, but must pay a share of the costs, Argenio said. 
</P>
<P>
The district's initial share was estimated at $1.5 million, but that estimate 
was revised by Los Angeles officials in May to more than $8 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Increases Expected 
</P>
<P>
Additional increases can be expected in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to be able to say this increase will take care of all foreseeable 
costs, but I cannot do that," Argenio said. "We believe that if actual costs 
are as high as projected, even this increase might not be adequate to meet our 
long-term obligations." 
</P>
<P>
Similar sewer service fee increases are planned by other districts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, for instance, expects the present monthly sewer fee of $8.24 paid 
by the average residential user to climb to $23.07 during the next five years, 
said Fred Hoeptner, a financial manager for the Los Angeles Department of 
Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
Argenio said the five-member water board deliberated for more than two months 
before "very reluctantly" authorizing the fee increase. "There was really no 
alternative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for multifamily dwellings and commercial users will climb by 138% in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Argenio said newsletters will be mailed within the next few weeks to all of the 
district's 30,000 customers alerting them to the fee increase. 
</P>
<P>
The higher fee will affect about two-thirds of the district's customers who are 
connected to the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Los Angeles, which charges sewer fees based on the amount of water used, 
residential customers in the Crescenta Valley pay a flat monthly rate. 
</P>
<P>
The district serves the unincorporated area of La Crescenta and a small portion 
of La Canada Flintridge.

WEST COVINA LOBBYING FOR LAW TO LIMIT POLICE LIABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG QUINTANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WEST COVINA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned about a successful malpractice lawsuit against the Police Department 
over a 1980 kidnap and murder investigation, West Covina officials have begun 
lobbying for laws to restrict police liability. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the City Council authorized an effort to change the laws under which 
it lost a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Ronald Alan Tolleson, whose son was 
found strangled in a neighbor's home that police had searched. 
</P>
<P>
In coming months, West Covina officials will contact individual legislators, 
and work through the League of California Cities to push for a bill that would 
restrict municipal liability. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina Police Chief Craig Meacham said the precedent established by the 
Tolleson decision and a similar case in Newport Beach put police under an 
unbearable burden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Relationship 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we undertake an ongoing investigation, we are under the very real 
probability we will be sued if the outcome of that investigation is not to the 
satisfaction of the crime victim or his family," Meacham said. "It doesn't mean 
that we don't make an arrest . . . that we have made mistakes. It just means 
that they were unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
In May, a Pomona Superior Court jury ruled that West Covina police had botched 
the 1980 investigation of 10-year-old Ronnie Tolleson's kidnaping, and that a 
"special relationship" existed between police and the elder Tolleson. During 
the trial, Tolleson argued that a more competent investigation might have saved 
his son, who may have been kept alive for days after his abduction. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the jury had to establish the relationship before the city 
could be held liable. The state Supreme Court has ruled that such relationships 
exist when crime victims put their total trust in police, based on the actions 
or assurances received from officers. 
</P>
<P>
Tolleson has said that at the time, he did not question the scope of the 
investigation and that he put complete faith in the police. In his testimony, 
Tolleson said he was led to believe that the FBI was actively involved in the 
case, when the agency was not. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Flaws 
</P>
<P>
He said he was told repeatedly by police that everything possible was being 
done to save Ronnie, and that his son would be returned safely. 
</P>
<P>
After finding serious flaws with the investigation -- including the lack of a 
full search of the neighbor's home -- jurors ruled that the relationship had 
been violated and awarded Tolleson $5.74 million. But on July 10, Superior 
Court Judge Robert A. Dukes reduced the jury's award to $300,000, saying the 
jury was blinded by emotion. 
</P>
<P>
While upholding the jury's finding that the city was at fault, Dukes urged West 
Covina to pursue legislation that would reduce police liability while 
clarifying the bounds of such a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Without some relief from verdicts like this one, police might have to choose 
which crimes to fully investigate, said Pleasanton Police Chief Bill Eastman, 
president of the California Police Chiefs Assn. "We'd become like district 
attorneys, we'd select our cases," Eastman said. 
</P>
<P>
Until late 1987, it appeared West Covina would never face the liability issues 
raised by the Tolleson case. But in October, the Court of Appeal reversed a 
trial judge's ruling and reinstated Tolleson's case, saying a "special 
relationship" existed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protective Duty 
</P>
<P>
Justice Campbell Lucas, writing for the two-member majority, stated that a 
special relationship is established when a public servant "voluntarily assumes 
a protective duty toward a member of the public and undertakes action on behalf 
of that member, thereby inducing reliance." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert L. Bacon said it was "ludicrous" that the reassuring statements 
made by police officers during the Tolleson investigation could be construed as 
an attempt to instill a false sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bacon said, "special relationship" as commonly applied in the private 
sector, should not apply to police agencies. Unlike other cases in which the 
courts have established that such relationships are voluntary, police 
departments have a duty to intervene when needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic problem is that when a police officer undertakes investigating a 
case, normally it is not in a (situation) where a voluntary relationship has 
occurred," said Bacon, a lawyer. "In every other case, it's a voluntary 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from cases in which public agencies are held liable under a special 
relationship, local government has been granted general immunity from such 
suits, even when errors have been made, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
Chipping away at this immunity would eventually erode public safety services, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meacham was more direct: "If these rulings are allowed to stand, our officers 
will be equipped with a Miranda card in one hand . . . and a waiver form in the 
other."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ALLEGED DRUNK DRIVER IN FATAL CRASH POSTS BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man, charged with murder last week after his wife was fatally 
injured in an accident allegedly caused by his drunk driving, was freed from 
Los Angeles County Jail on $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
County Criminal Courts records show that one day after bail was set, Harry 
Bouboushian, 34, was freed Thursday after posting a $50,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
Bouboushian has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder as well as to one 
count of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, one count of hit-and-run 
driving and two counts of felony drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Bouboushian was exceeding 100 m.p.h. when his 1988 BMW crashed on 
Los Feliz Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Armine Karapetian, Bouboushian's wife, was killed in the accident and six other 
passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Bouboushian, owner of an Inglewood body shop, had two previous drunk-driving 
convictions and had completed a court-ordered drunk-driving treatment program 
three days before the accident, police said. Authorities said he also had six 
outstanding tickets for speeding. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing is scheduled Tuesday.

NEWSSTANDS, BOOKSTORES CATER TO SPANISH-SPEAKING READERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Latino readers, there is a little bit of everything at Laurel Newsstand in 
Pacoima, where the affable owner, Lewis (Lucky Lew) Gross, greets his customers 
with broken Spanish and a heavy New York accent. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age girls browse through his Spanish-language collection of romantic 
comic-strip novels while immigrant workers ask him for Mexico City "scandal 
sheets" filled with graphic stories of murder and corruption. And Gross sells 
Low Rider magazine to the young Chicanos who cruise surrounding streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We specialize in Spanish because 95% of the people here are Spanish," said 
Gross, a 75-year-old former New York City policeman. "There's no Jews here but 
me. . . . If you find someone here who isn't Spanish, they're probably lost." 
</P>
<P>
The transplanted Easterner might not seem to fit the role, but his little 
newsstand on Van Nuys Boulevard is an important part of the cultural life of 
the East Valley. His business is one of a handful of Valley newsstands and 
bookstores where everything from Penthouse magazine to the Bible are available 
in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday, business at Gross' newsstand was slow, but steady. "I'm 
looking for Cosmopolitan in Spanish, but I can't find it," said Maria Holguin, 
an El Paso native who lives in Pacoima, as she scanned the racks of magazines. 
Eventually, she took a copy of a comic book, "El Pato Donald" (Donald Duck), 
for her 4-year-old daughter, Kristina. 
</P>
<P>
Gross boasts the largest collection of Spanish magazines and newspapers in the 
Valley. La Opinion is the biggest seller, with about 150 copies sold each day. 
He pointed with pride to 14 different English-Spanish dictionaries and 
self-taught courses in U.S. civics. "They use those to study for the amnesty," 
Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything is informative and educational, however. Gross also sells about 
20 different sexually oriented magazines, most in plastic wrappers, in both 
Spanish and English. The language doesn't really matter, Gross said, since no 
one really reads these magazines anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Also popular are the sensationalist Mexican magazines, such as Alarma!, which 
display the tortured bodies of crime victims in color photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Donato Jimenez, 55, said he likes these magazines because they are relaxing and 
a diversion from his job as a hospital janitor. He said he has found articles 
about a growing scandal surrounding the Mexico City police force especially 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
"They're real crooks," Jimenez said. "All those rats in Mexico who are 
policemen and who are robbing the people. . . . I'm glad they arrested them." 
</P>
<P>
For the Chicano youth of the East Valley, Gross sells not just Low Rider but 
also Teen Angels at $9.95. The Rialto-based magazine features, among other 
things, snapshots of tough-looking youths posing before graffiti-scarred walls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Mission 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice magazine," Gross said, as he leafed through the glossy pages with 
elaborate drawings. 
</P>
<P>
No copies of Teen Angel or Alarma! can be found a few miles away in Arleta, 
where Roberto Lozano and his wife, Marta, operate another Spanish-language 
bookstore, the Libreria Cristiana Emmanuel on Nordhoff Street. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano is a member of the evangelical Servants of God Church in Van Nuys. He 
said he considers it part of his personal mission to fight precisely the kind 
of literature sold at Gross' and other newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
"Pornography and all those kinds of books where they talk about drugs and 
drinking -- that doesn't help people," Lozano said. "We feel we have to speak 
out against that with books that help the family." 
</P>
<P>
Lozano said the bestseller at his Christian bookstore is the Bible. He sells 
about a dozen versions -- leather-bound and paperback, with extra-large type 
and one on a cassette for the bed-ridden or illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'My Heart Is Here' 
</P>
<P>
Lozano, a 46-year-old worker at the General Motors plant in Van Nuys, said he 
opened the bookstore after years of traveling to downtown Los Angeles with his 
fellow church members to find religious literature in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been my dream for 15 years," Lozano said. "I have a secular job, but 
my heart is here. I come whenever I can." 
</P>
<P>
Most Spanish-language bookstores in the Valley supplement their sales by 
carrying other merchandise. Although it is called a bookstore, for example, the 
Libreria Mexico in San Fernando actually carries more records, tapes and 
cosmetics than books and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Still, reading material makes up an important part of the store's sales, said 
owner Arturo de la Parra, who founded the bookstore 20 years ago with his wife, 
Maria. The daily newspapers La Prensa Grafica of El Salvador and Excelsior of 
Mexico both sell briskly as do the store's small collection of dime novels. 
</P>
<P>
One teen-age girl blushed when a visitor asked her about the small book she had 
just purchased. It was titled, "Deseo" (Desire), the story of young woman's 
romantic adventures as a photojournalist on a Greek island. 
</P>
<P>
"I buy one every week. They're exciting," she said in Spanish. "You never know 
what will happen next."

LOUISE SEEKS TO BETTER HER LIFTS AT FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heat and weights hang heavy in the air each time Carole Louise plows through 
her weight-lifting regimen in a prop room beneath the auditorium at Van Nuys 
High. 
</P>
<P>
The makeshift gym, home to the Van Nuys Weightlifting Club, boasts three small 
plywood platforms squeezed between the planks, tables, paint buckets and 
assorted production materials strewn about the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Louise, however, does not seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year old La Crescenta resident believes the spartan facility lends 
itself to success because it is devoid of health club props such as glistening 
chrome machines, stationary bicycles and bottled water imported from the French 
Alps. 
</P>
<P>
"To do this sport, you accept some of the strange things and the hardships," 
Louise says. "That's part of the mystique. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing it gives you more than anything else is self-confidence. If I can 
lift almost 200 pounds over my head, then I figure I can pretty much do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Louise will attempt to lift more weight than she ever has before 
when she begins competition in the U. S. Olympic Sports Festival in Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Louise, 5-foot-9, 180 pounds, is competing in the women's 82.5-kilogram (182 
pounds) weight division, which is one class below the super-heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
Last April in Houston, Louise finished third in her class at the women's 
nationals. Her goal at the Olympic Festival is to surpass personal bests of 139 
pounds in the snatch -- in which the bar is lifted overhead in one unbroken 
movement -- and 188 pounds in the clean and jerk -- in which the bar is brought 
to the shoulders and then pushed overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not thinking too much about winning because I'm still gaining experience," 
Louise said during a workout last week. "I'll consider it a successful trip if 
I can improve my PRs (personal records) and technique." 
</P>
<P>
Outfitted in blue Lycra shorts, an old red polo-style shirt and red and white 
weight lifters' shoes with built up heels and rounded toes, Louise repeatedly 
grasps, lifts then drops the weighted bar to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Louise was a multi-sport athlete at Crescenta Valley High and threw the javelin 
for Valley College, but she never attempted serious weight training until she 
got out of school. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, she was exercising on machines in a health spa when, Louise 
recalled, "This guy saw me and he said, 'You wanna lift some real weights?' " 
</P>
<P>
She joined the Van Nuys Weightlifting Club, a group of about 10 lifters 
supervised by Bob Takano, a biology teacher at Van Nuys High. 
</P>
<P>
Louise, however, quit after only three months when she suffered a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
She did not return until February of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I was almost 30," Louise recalled. "I looked in the mirror and said, 'We gotta 
do something quick.' " 
</P>
<P>
Louise returned to the Van Nuys club where she works out four to five times a 
week with other members such as Diana Fuhrman, who is first in the nation and 
fourth in the world in the 67.5-kilogram (148.5 pounds) weight division. 
</P>
<P>
"Carole had a lot of strength to begin with, but at first it was something she 
was doing to get in shape," said Fuhrman, who is also participating in the 
Olympic Festival. "I still would like to see her dedicate more time than she 
does now." 
</P>
<P>
Louise, however, is already strapped for time. 
</P>
<P>
Her "day" begins at 2:30 a.m. when she reports to work as a mail handler for 
the Postal Service. After eight hours of "swinging 40-pound sacks on and off 
trucks," she sleeps for a few hours before driving to Van Nuys for her 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
Motivation is not always easy to come by. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I have to force myself to come here," Louise said. "But once you 
get here and work up a little sweat and see some progress, it makes it OK." 
</P>
<P>
It's also OK for women to lift weights, build muscle and be proud of it, she 
said. Conveying that message to men and other women is one of Louise's primary 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Millions of women in this country are screwed up because corporate America has 
this vision of what a woman is supposed to look like," Louise said. "I just 
want women to know they can be big and strong. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in my 30s and feel like I'm in my prime. And I think I'm going to be in 
better shape when I'm 40." 
</P>

LIFE ON WHEELS: CAR THEFT RANKING IS NOT TOO ALARMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You say you're fed up with Orange County: the traffic, the high cost of 
housing, the hectic pace? You're thinking Fresno might be nice. Maybe 
Sacramento. Or even someplace in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Well here's at least one reason to stay put. Your car is much more likely to be 
stolen in any of those counties than it is here. Twice as likely, in fact, in 
San Diego County, which has the dubious distinction of ranking first in car 
thefts among California's 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics just compiled by the Tustin-based Western Insurance 
Information Service, San Diego County had 1,645.19 car thefts per 100,000 
residents in 1988 and the first part of 1989. Orange County, with 792.36 
vehicle thefts per 100,000 residents, was ninth. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco County was second with 1,335.52 thefts per 100,000, followed by 
Los Angeles County with 1,326.95, Sacramento County with 1,082.06 and Fresno 
County with 907.73. Riverside County placed sixth with a rate of 849.82. In 
seventh place was San Bernardino County, whose rate was 849.24. Alameda County 
ranked eighth with a rate of 805.09, and San Joaquin County placed 10th with 
684.77 thefts per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra County placed last with a goose egg -- not a single car reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The median rate, according to WIIS spokeswoman Debbie Rosenzweig, was 287.67. 
</P>
<P>
If you happen to drive a 1988 Hyundai Excel, you might want to look into life 
in mountainous, remote Sierra County -- or at least stay out of San Diego 
County. Those particular Hyundais are stolen more often than any other car in 
California, according to Rosenzweig. In second through 10th place are various 
models of Toyotas. And the 1987 Hyundai Excel came in 11th. 
</P>
<P>
I have my own unscientific theory about why Orange County's car-theft rate is 
so low compared to the state's other densely populated counties. We spend so 
much time in our cars here that the thieves don't have a chance -- after all, 
it's pretty difficult to steal a car that's stuck on a clogged freeway, 
especially with the driver still in it. 
</P>
<P>
But for those rare moments when we do leave our cars, car alarms can help foil 
thieves. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most sophisticated alarm can't make a car totally theft-proof, of 
course. "But thieves tend to pick the cars that are easiest to break into," 
says Officer Ken Daily of the California Highway Patrol's San Juan Capistrano 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Daily, who has a factory-installed alarm on his personal car, says there are 
several types of alarms. 
</P>
<P>
"There are motion detectors, which have a switch that is tripped when the car 
shakes -- such as when someone hooks it up to tow it away," Daily says. More 
sensitive motion detectors can also be attached to windows, sounding the alarm 
if a thief jimmies or breaks the glass. Motion detectors can also be wired to 
the engine compartment, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Other alarms protect the ignition. "There's an ignition bypass, where you 
ground the ignition with a switch and then hide the switch somewhere in the 
car. That sets it up so that if you turn the switch on, the car can't be 
started," Daily says. 
</P>
<P>
Some alarms use a siren, while others simply set off the car's horn, Daily 
says. Most will sound for a few minutes, then reset. 
</P>
<P>
Another theft-prevention device makes no noise at all, but Daily says it's one 
of the most effective. It's a J-shaped piece of metal that attaches to the 
steering wheel, or in some cases to the wheel and brake pedal. Of course, 
neither that locking device nor alarms linked to a car's ignition system can 
keep a thief from ripping out your car's stereo. 
</P>
<P>
Some radios in more expensive cars are electronically coded so that if they're 
removed and installed in another car they won't work, Daily says. But if yours 
isn't coded, you might want to try disguising your Blaupunkt or other expensive 
system with a fake front to make it look like a cheap radio, he suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Or try a pullout stereo system, suggests Jennifer Keesee, a sales associate at 
Anaheim Electronics, which sells and installs both car alarms and stereos. 
Keesee says most of her clients don't need a sales pitch because "either 
they've just had their cars broken into or they're getting new cars and just 
don't want to go through it." 
</P>
<P>
Car alarms start at about $170, installed, and go up to $550, depending on the 
type of alarm and the extra features, Keesee says. Some can be turned on and 
off with remote-control devices; others are passive, controlled by the car's 
ignition. If you're the forgetful type, Keesee says, you might want to get an 
alarm with built-in passive arming, which automatically turns on the alarm 
after a certain amount of time if you forget to do it. 
</P>
<P>
If you do have an alarm, don't neglect to turn it on, even if the car is in 
what you consider a safe place. 
</P>
<P>
Keesee said it's not unusual for car thefts to occur in your own driveway. 
</P>
<P>
"That happens all the time," Keesee says. "People come in and say, 'It was in 
my driveway. I thought it was safe.' But it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Most insurance companies offer a discount to customers who install car alarms, 
Rosenzweig says. "It's something the customer is doing to try to help protect 
their vehicle, so they do take that into account."

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sea Festival begins Saturday with an oar and paddle regatta that will 
include canoes, kayaks, surf skis and gondolas. 
</P>
<P>
The regatta, modeled after a similar tradition in Italy, will start at 9:30 
a.m. in Alamitos Bay at the Gondola Get-Away, 5437 E. Ocean Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Boats will follow a 10-mile course past three Long Beach oil islands and finish 
at the Belmont Pier. All boaters who complete the course will get a diploma. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers expect the event to attract about 150 boats, said Mike O'Toole, a 
director of the event and co-owner of the Gondola Get-Away, which takes 
visitors on tours around the Naples Island area on gondolas. 
</P>
<P>
The regatta is open to racing and recreational boaters, O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
Other Sea Festival events this weekend include a junior volleyball tournament, 
three-on-three basketball and a sabot regatta, which is for sailboats. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Festival, sponsored by the Long Beach Parks and Recreation Department, 
runs through Aug. 13.

AGENT TO STARS,'LUCKIEST GUY IN WORLD,' HAS LITTLE FIELD NAMED AFTER HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why don't sharks eat Hollywood agents? 
</P>
<P>
Professional courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
That's an old joke in Hollywood, where agents are perceived as only slightly 
more sensitive and moral than producers. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, not every agent fits the profile. There is one out there who 
actually gives agents a good name. Jack Gilardi of Beverly Hills is probably 
the only agent who has had a Little League field named after him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not your average Hollywood agent," said O. J. Simpson, who has been 
represented by Gilardi for 17 years on nothing but a handshake. "He's almost 
like a camp counselor." 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi is a senior agent at International Creative Management with a client 
list that ranges from Joan Collins and Faye Dunaway to the Fat Boys and Don 
Rickles. He goes to church. He raises thousands of dollars for charity. He 
loves kids. He returns phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack is a class guy, a man well-loved in his profession," said Dodgers Manager 
Tommy Lasorda, who has been friends for years with Gilardi. For 26 years, 
Gilardi and producer Joe Siegman -- Gilardi gets the celebrities, Siegman 
writes the gags -- has run the annual Hollywood Stars Night at Dodger Stadium, 
which benefits the Motion Picture Relief Fund. 
</P>
<P>
There's a black-and-white photo of Lasorda and Gilardi in Gilardi's cozy office 
on the seventh floor of the ICM building in West Los Angeles. Overlooking the 
Hollywood Hills, the office is filled with antique furniture, but the dominant 
feature is a collection of National Football League helmets. There is also 
enough sports memorabilia to start a museum: boxing gloves, baseball caps, 
score cards, an engraved bat given to him by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi, who's about 50 (he won't give his exact age), has thick brown hair 
swept straight back and a wiry, athletic build. He is a man with a reputation 
for fair play and honesty in a cutthroat profession. He hangs out with sports 
legends and Hollywood icons. He was married "for 18 wonderful years" to Annette 
Funicello, one of the original Mouseketeers who is still his client, and they 
have three children. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Gilardi says, "I'm the luckiest guy in the world." 
</P>
<P>
A second-generation Italian-American, Gilardi wanted to be a doctor when he was 
growing up in Chicago. So instead of taking a baseball scholarship to Notre 
Dame or Illinois, he attended Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, a small Catholic 
school that didn't even have a baseball team. But his medical career ended when 
he "ran into organic chemistry -- or it ran into me." He graduated with a 
degree in business and was drafted into the Army for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Stationed at Ft. Knox, Ky., he got the break of a lifetime. As a private, he 
was assigned to book entertainment -- Duke Ellington, Ray Anthony -- on the 
base, giving him a show business education and innumerable connections. 
Discharged from the service, he was offered jobs with three big entertainment 
agencies in the Midwest. But William Morris wanted him to start as a typist and 
the Music Corp. of America wanted him to wrap band posters in the publicity 
department. Only General Artists Corp. said it would hire him as an agent. 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't even know what an agent did," Gilardi said. 
</P>
<P>
He learned fast. In 1958, GAC -- the forerunner of ICM -- transferred him to 
Los Angeles and put him in charge of the "cocktail department," meaning that he 
represented talent that performed in local nightclubs such as the Melody Room 
on Sunset Strip. In two years, he was running the agency's entire West Coast 
nightclub department, a territory that included Las Vegas and Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Gilardi was spending a lot of leisure hours at P.J.s, a West 
Hollywood club. Gilardi hung out with teen idol Frankie Avalon and Harvey 
Lembeck, the comic actor who played Cpl. Rocco Barbella alongside Phil Silvers' 
Sgt. Ernie Bilko on television's "The Phil Silvers Show." They began playing 
pickup softball games at Roxbury Park against a team that included comedians 
Buddy Hackett and Shecky Greene. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden I got calls from other people in the business who wanted to 
play games against us," Gilardi recalls. Before Gilardi knew it, he was 
commissioner of the Hollywood Entertainment League, which became a major part 
of the industry's social whirl. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the major stars of the early '60s had teams. There were Jerry Lewis' 
Clowns and Dean Martin's Dinos, James Garner's Gems and Pat Boone's Boones. 
Producers Aaron Spelling and David Wolper played. So did Jack Nicholson, Bobby 
Darin, Burt Reynolds and the Nelson boys, David and Ricky. Gilardi played on 
the United Jewish Italians, which was sponsored by a Union 76 station. 
</P>
<P>
After the league started up, Gilardi began dating Funicello. They married, and 
when their first child, Gina, was born in 1965, Annette began showing up at 
softball games pushing a baby carriage. But by the mid-'60s, the league began 
to change. Teams were bringing in ringers, circumventing a rule that limited 
rosters to players who worked in the entertainment industry. And when the 
caliber of play increased, the stars began to lose their enthusiasm. "Some of 
them couldn't compete that heavily," Gilardi said. "They just weren't that 
good." 
</P>
<P>
By the late '60s, Gilardi was spending his time with his young family and his 
burgeoning business and could no longer devote a lot of energy to running a 
10-team league, so in 1969 he announced his retirement as commissioner. The 
league went on for another year before it folded. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody else was willing to take on total responsibility," Gilardi said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi's involvement with the Hollywood Stars began in 1963. One of his 
clients was Nat King Cole, who had been captain and organizer of a celebrity 
team and asked Gilardi to take it over for him. Gilardi enlisted the help of 
Siegman, who had moved from Chicago. Today, comedian Billy Crystal is captain 
of one team and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar heads another. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big deal to a lot of the stars," said Gilardi, who keeps a photo of 
Funicello standing in the shadows of Abdul-Jabbar. "You can't book Billy 
Crystal when there's a game. He'll block off those days." 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Gilardi, who lived in Encino, signed up his son Jackie, then 8, in the 
Encino Little League. Five years later, his youngest son, Jason, began playing. 
Gilardi managed their teams. He got Annette to staff the snack stand and 
Simpson to throw out the first ball. He was league president for a year. And 
aside from being the most popular manager, said former league President Bernie 
Paperny, Gilardi raised about $200,000 for the league. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the backbone of all fund raising," said Paperny. "He worked countless 
hours and asked nothing in exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Katofsky another former league president, remembers Gilardi's ability to 
elicit donations for the league's fund-raisers. "He even had a boat donated 
that we sold at an auction," Katofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi has had a close relationship with the players, Paperny said. "He was 
like a father to all of them and made them feel good about themselves. 
Everybody wanted to play on his team. One year the kids elected him to manage 
the all-star team with 95% of the votes." 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi did not allow parents to meddle, Katofsky said, and winning was not as 
important as the players' personal growth. "If his players lost, they had to be 
good sports," Katofsky said. "All he demanded of them was that they do their 
best and try hard." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Katofsky led a movement to name the main field at the Encino Little 
League complex after Gilardi. The announcement, made at a league banquet at the 
Sheraton Universal hotel, "was a complete surprise," Gilardi said. A photo 
above his office desk shows him standing on the field by a sign that reads: 
"Gilardi Field -- in honor of Jack Gilardi -- for his dedication to Encino 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Gilardi's largess and his extensive contacts have made him an easy touch -- 
he's known as the man to see for hard-to-get tickets to sports events and 
concerts. He even arranged a private tour of the Vatican for an associate. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack truly likes to help people," Siegman said, "and he's helped out an 
enormous number of people." 
</P>
<P>
But Gilardi will call in an IOU. "For every favor you ask, you have to give 
back two," he says. "So you better consider which one you ask for." 
</P>
<P>
In his office, Gilardi points to another photo on his wall, taken about 14 
years ago. The ICM softball team is playing archrival William Morris. There's a 
brawl going on. Players are squared off. Except for one. "That's me," Gilardi 
said, "trying to break up the fight." 
</P>
<P>
And blow a chance to go for the jugular. No, Gilardi is not your average 
Hollywood agent.

FOR SOME, FINDING LOVE CAN BE A TALL ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley Tall Singles held a barbecue and pool party this month 
at Marita Pinkel's house in Arcadia. Men were supposed to be at least 6 feet 
tall; women, 5-foot-8. A few didn't quite measure up but stuck around anyway, a 
development that was remarked upon by purists in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Longstreet, a 6-foot-2 critical-care nurse who's been going to tall 
singles events around the country for more than 20 years, sized up the mixed 
crowd on Pinkel's lawn with a critical eye. "Most of the Tall Clubs expect the 
men to be 6-2, and the girls have to be at least 5-10," she grumped, gesturing 
toward a shorty or two. "They even used to have initiations and measurings." 
</P>
<P>
On the tall club circuit, which stretches from Culver City to Fountain Valley 
to Riverside, the San Gabriel Valley club is about as liberal as they get. One 
woman, a once in awhile participant, even confessed to friends as the party was 
warming up that she was really only 5-foot-6. 
</P>
<P>
"Me? I'm 1,830 millimeters," Eric Kaczynski said self-righteously. One of the 
marginal men, he stretched to his full height -- six feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Tape Measures 
</P>
<P>
But nobody was going around with a tape measure Saturday night. The emphasis 
was supposed to be more on having a good time than on imposing rigorous 
physical standards. At least, that's the way Pat McGookin saw it. "It's the 
person that's important, not the size of the package," said McGookin, a 
5-foot-10 grandmother from Pasadena, standing shoulder-deep in the pool, the 
palms of her hands moving gently against the water. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-year-old organization certainly has its share of people who have to 
duck going through doors. Rob over there, for example. He could easily slam 
dunk without standing on a chair. A limber 6-foot-6 Cal State Northridge 
accounting major, Rob gives you the restless young man's perspective on the 
club. "A lot of young people come and get disappointed," said Rob, 28. "The way 
I see it, this could be a total bust, but it's early. Every place else that I 
ordinarily go to is still open." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of the club, which has accumulated a mailing list of more than 500 
tall people, is to provide a low-pressure setting for the rangy crowd to get 
together, said Joan Brady, a YWCA executive who is one of the organization's 
founders. "It's hard enough being single, but if you're a 6-foot-1 woman, 
sometimes it's difficult meeting people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There are activities almost every weekend -- pool parties, game nights, beach 
excursions and, about eight times a year, discount weekends in Palm Springs. 
"It's a real nice club," said Brady, who is 5-foot-10. "We get nice-quality 
people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Young Meets Old 
</P>
<P>
Heterogeneous, too. There's probably a 35- to 40-year spread between youngest 
and oldest. And maybe a 12-inch spread between shortest and tallest. 
</P>
<P>
Spread out in Pinkel's yard or lollygagging in the pool, the three dozen or so 
singles didn't look much different from the singles crowd anywhere else 
nowadays: wary, studiously blase, their eyes drifting frequently to the door to 
see who might be coming through. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not here to meet anybody," Longstreet said. "I just want to talk to 
people, dance. I feel more comfortable here than other places." 
</P>
<P>
There's a certain vulnerability to being single nowadays, Brady says. "The 
climate of singleness has changed," she said. "People want partners." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But the business of coupling was flowing like molasses this evening. 
A big three-quarter moon floated up over the pepper tree next door, and Pinkel, 
a native of Upstate New York who delights in playing hostess, turned on the 
lights in the pool. "The Jacuzzi's getting hot, folks," Pinkel announced 
invitingly. 
</P>
<P>
Time to talk about romance. Well, how about frustrated romance? 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coming a year (to Tall Club events)," said Tessy Muir, a willowy 
elementary schoolteacher in a wide-brimmed hat, "and I've only met one decent 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
"I've met two guys, but they just sort of disappeared," piped in Muir's best 
friend, Robin Hansen, an Army reservist who was wearing an Army T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
The singles scene in the San Gabriel Valley, with its Pasadena restaurants and 
Monrovia nightclubs, is as pressured and unrewarding as it is anywhere else, 
club members said. "There are a lot of clubs around if you want to just hang 
out with your peers," said Rob, still wearing his sunglasses. "All the trendy 
places are somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
But bar-hopping can run into a lot of money. "You go to a bar and dance with 
somebody, then she turns away and dances with somebody else," said Rob, who 
gets by on a student's stipend. "Or else you follow her around all night." Rob 
met a tall single one night and took her out. "She said she didn't mind paying 
her own way, but I think she did," he said gloomily. 
</P>
<P>
Bob, a muscular bruiser who looks as if he could paint the ceiling without 
using a ladder, is a first-timer this evening. He isn't sure he'll be back. "I 
usually don't go with tall women," said Bob, 35, a factory supervisor. "They're 
not that good-looking. I've been married before, and I'm looking for a 
particular kind of woman." Like what? "Petite and good looking." 
</P>
<P>
There's a fundamental injustice about tallness, several women say. It can be 
seen as desirable in men ("Read the personals and the women are always looking 
for somebody tall," said one woman.) but a liability in women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Was the Pits' 
</P>
<P>
"I was always taller than all the guys," said Chicago-born Dorothy Prince, a 
statuesque 5-foot-11. "It was the pits. I think I was 5-9 in junior high. I did 
not date in high school." 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian-born Longstreet ran into similar difficulties. "When you're a 
teen-ager, it's a big complex," she said. "I got used to seeing people see me 
and then take a second look." 
</P>
<P>
But standards are changing, club members said. The old taboo about women not 
dating men shorter than themselves is eroding. "You don't get ridiculed any 
more if you do it," said Prince. 
</P>
<P>
"All of those rules have been thrown out," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you want somebody who fits, Prince said. "My friend Pauline says she's 
tired of looking guys straight in the eyes," she said. "I'm tired of looking 
down at them. At least you know the men here are attracted to tall ladies." 
</P>
<P>
By evening's end, no one had made that all-important love connection. At least, 
not that anyone else could tell. "A lot of people come, then you won't see them 
for awhile, and you hear they're dating," said Brady. "That happens a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, those kinds of things don't always work out. "Sometimes they come 
back in six months and say they've split up," she said. "Or else you never see 
them again, because they're afraid they'll see the guy at one of our 
functions." 
</P>
<P>
But there's also the occasional jackpot. "I brought a longtime friend to one of 
our parties," said Brady, "and introduced him to the hostess. A few months 
later, I asked her if she wanted to have another party. She said, 'I can't, 
because Jim and I are getting married.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Give It a Chance' 
</P>
<P>
The churlish Bob had left early, apparently in search of a more petite partner, 
but Rob was sticking it out. By 10, he was dispiritedly counting his blessings. 
"You got to give it a chance," he said. "It's not a bad way to spend an 
afternoon, even if you don't score." 
</P>
<P>
Pat McGookin, who says she has been to every disco between San Diego and San 
Francisco in the 17 years since she got her divorce, takes a more philosophical 
view. Don't get hung up on the search, she suggested. "My theory is: If you go 
someplace and you're having a good time," she said, "other people will want to 
share that good time." 
</P>
<P>
"Life is like a piano," Marita Pinkel added brightly. "It's how you play it 
that makes a difference."

SPECIAL CLASSES FOR FOREIGN STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Los Angeles College in Culver City will offer classes and tutoring to 
foreign students in the coming academic year. 
</P>
<P>
English, business, music appreciation, travel and other courses will have 
special sections that will address issues that a foreign-born person might not 
automatically understand, said foreign student adviser Jewel D'Aloia. 
</P>
<P>
D'Aloia will teach a one-unit "Introduction to College" class that will cover 
study skills and American higher education. It will also offer information on 
health insurance, what to do after a car accident and other pointers on 
adapting to the United States, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The English department will provide sessions on reducing accents, D'Aloia said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 200 of the two-year college's 9,000 students held 
foreign-student visas from 36 countries, D'Aloia said.

OFFBEAT SPORTS ATTRACT 38 COMPETITORS FROM COUNTY 
</P>

 -- They can not, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered typical 
spectator sports. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, very few Southern California high schools give out varsity 
letters in field hockey, team handball, canoeing or kayaking. 
</P>
<P>
It is only at the national and international levels that these very low-profile 
activities manage to gain a measure of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. Olympic Festival, which began last Saturday and concludes Sunday, is 
an event which provides such an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
And the 38 Ventura County athletes participating in the three sports are taking 
full advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's field hockey competition, exactly half of the 50 participants 
split among the four regional teams list Ventura County cities as their 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
A first-round game between the West and the South last Sunday resembled a 
Conejo Valley all-star scrimmage. Of the 30 players taking part in the game, 24 
were from the East end of Ventura County, former home of the sport's national 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately enough, the game ended in a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ruvalcaba of Thousand Oaks scored the South's only goal 7:55 into the 
game. The West's scoring came from Ventura's Benjamin Maruquin, whose goal came 
with four minutes left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The South missed a chance to go ahead on a penalty attempt when John O'Neill of 
Newbury Park kicked a shot over the top of the goal with seven minutes left in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
A Festival single-session record crowd of 1,084 watched goalkeeper Tom Vano of 
Simi Valley secure five saves for the West. 
</P>
<P>
After two games, the South and West are both undefeated. On Monday, the South 
got four goals from County players in a 5-2 decision over the North. Meanwhile, 
Vano accounted for six more saves as the West tied again, 2-2, in a match 
against the East. 
</P>
<P>
The medal games will be played Friday night at Cameron Stadium in Lawton, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
In team handball, members of the Condors, a Ventura club, have accounted 39 of 
the 58 goals scored by the West as it won two of its first three games. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Fercho of Camarillo scored five times in a 17-16 decision over the North 
on Saturday, then followed it up with four goals in a 27-21 loss to the East on 
Sunday. He had three more in a 20-17 win over the South on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Against the East, Kevin Withrow of Thousand Oaks led all scorers with seven 
goals. He added four more against the South. 
</P>
<P>
Monday was Jeff Fruin's turn to lead the team in scoring. Fruin, of Camarillo, 
made a game-high six goals, including four in the last 12 minutes of the first 
half as the West fought back from an early deficit. 
</P>
<P>
A family team brought the County its first gold medal of the Festival on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Buena High graduates Fred and David Spaulding won the two-man canoe 1,000-meter 
race at Lake Overholser with a time of 3:55.87. Earlier in the day, Fred won a 
silver in the individual 1,000-meter race with a time of 4:17.74. David took 
the bronze in 4:21.83. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Spauldings combined efforts again in the 500-meter doubles 
event, but this time had to settle for silver. Fred won another silver in the 
500-meter singles race with a time of 2:01.98. David was fourth in 2:05.64 and 
Jim Harper of Ventura was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there are 50 County athletes and coaches participating in the Festival. 
Among the other top local performers are figure skater Tisha Walker and men's 
basketball player Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a 5-1, 101-pound 15-year old from Thousand Oaks, was fifth in women's 
figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean, a UCLA sophomore from Simi Valley, scored 31 points in three games for 
the West team. 
</P>
<P>
EIGHT IS ENOUGH

MIXING SPIKES AND CLEATS;

<P>
JIM KLEIN OF PACIFIC PALISADES TO PLAY VOLLEYBALL, FOOTBALL AT STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRYL LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Very few athletes have done it. Manu Tuiasosopo wanted to give it a go and was 
advised not to. The last guy to pull it off, UCLA's Bill Pearlman, did it in 
the mid-'60s, though not spectacularly. Jim Klein thinks he can do it -- and 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, a Pacific Palisades resident and graduate of Loyola High School, will 
begin his attempt this fall to do what virtually no college athlete has done: 
play a contributing, maybe even starring, role on volleyball and football 
squads. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jimmy is one of the top athletes in the country coming out of high 
school," said Dennis Green, Stanford University's head football mentor and one 
of two coaches Klein will report to during his four years in Palo Alto. "He has 
all the athletic tools you're looking for and he's a tremendous worker." 
</P>
<P>
Klein will have to manage his time and energy to play both sports, however. He 
received a small sample this week of the demands of engaging in two sports 
simultaneously. He had to drop out of Friday night's Shrine All-Star football 
game at the Rose Bowl. The reason? He's one of only a dozen high school 
volleyball players invited to participate in the U.S. Olympic Festival this 
month at Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
The habits that pushed Klein to excel in sports also pushed him to expand. His 
quick feet and aggressive style on the football field fit into his volleyball 
game nicely, and he carries his 37-inch vertical leap and exceptional body 
control from above the volleyball net to under opponents chins as a bruising 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to take both sports as far as I can," says Klein, whose 6-foot-3, 
205-pound frame is ideally suited for either outside hitter, his volleyball 
position, or defensive back, where Green plans to use him in football. 
</P>
<P>
The modern era of the two-sport athlete, ushered in eye-openingly by a fellow 
named Bo who diddles in pro football and baseball, is gaining steam. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball-football combination is most common, though Michael Jordan has few 
doubters that when his NBA career is over he'll win money on the pro golf tour, 
and a big football player named Tony Mandarich wants to be, and seems to be, a 
potential pro fighter. 
</P>
<P>
But there are no standouts in the college volleyball/football double. 
</P>
<P>
"That's because the two require the use of vastly different muscles. You need a 
big upper body (for volleyball) because you're always blocking balls and diving 
onto the floor. But bulk, in relation to volleyball, is not all that good," 
said Al Scates, UCLA's volleyball coach and runner-up in the race for Klein's 
volleyball services. 
</P>
<P>
Bulk, however, is exactly what Klein intends to add once he gets situated 
within Stanford's athletic system. He wants to pack on 15 pounds of muscle, to 
add ferocity for his projected strong safety spot on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
"I love those big safeties," Klein says, mentioning hulking Cincinnati Bengal 
back David Fulcher as one of those admired. "They're like linemen running 
around in the defensive backfield." 
</P>
<P>
Scates doubts that Klein will become too massive for the volleyball court and 
that his quickness will probably remain intact with a few added pounds. But 
Tuiasosopo, a massive UCLA defensive tackle and accomplished beach volleyball 
player, was trying, says Scates, to lug football pounds onto volleyball's 
courts. 
</P>

"He would have had to lose some weight to play for me," said Scates, who has 
guided the Bruins to several national volleyball titles. "He was very explosive 
and very quick, but he was 30 pounds overweight. He wasn't willing to lose that 
weight because he knew he was going to play pro football and would need it." 
</P>
<P>
Klein, not as naturally big as Tuiasosopo, will have no such problem. Besides, 
he says, "I can afford to get a little bigger." 
</P>
<P>
If heredity lends a small nudge, Klein will have plenty of growth spurts in his 
future. His dad, former L.A. Ram and San Diego Charger tight end Bob Klein, 
played pro ball at 6-feet-5 and 245 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember seeing him (Bob Klein) play volleyball, soccer, lacrosse, football, 
you name it," says Scates, who watched Klein play football for USC and just 
about all other sports for leisure and competition. 
</P>
<P>
Says Jim Klein: "As kids we played everything that was possible: tennis, 
soccer, golf, basketball, football, you name it." 
</P>
<P>
The interest rubbed off not only on Jim but on older sister Kristin, who was 
the PAC-10's Freshman of the Year in volleyball at Stanford last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked her about me coming there to go to school, and she said she loved it 
(the idea)," says Jim, who adds that his sister's presence carried a fair 
amount of weight in his choice to attend Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," he said, "the only schools we considered were USC, UCLA and 
Stanford, because of the combination of sports I wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
The choice of schools may have been few, but the three universities didn't have 
any problems returning Klein's interest. One of the reasons was his immense 
talent. Another was the chance to get a "free" volleyball player -- and a good 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't usually recruit (volleyball) players who are highly regarded as 
football players, because football offers so many more scholarships and the 
players are likely to accept a football offer," said Scates, who knew that the 
Bruin football coaches wanted to offer Klein a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
He also knew that Klein was set on playing volleyball in addition to football. 
Thus, Scates would have had a sought-after volleyball player who already has a 
scholarship. Instead, Stanford volleyball Coach Fred Sturm, courtesy of 
Stanford's football offer, will receive Klein's participation with the team 
without giving up a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of flexibility Klein offers also can cause problems for coaches. "We 
feel he has the potential to be a dominant strong or free safety," said Green. 
"The problem with that is, I think he could be a darn good tight end." 
</P>
<P>
Before Klein can be labeled as the wrench that fits all bolts, his basketball 
background needs to be checked out. Naturally, he played on Loyola's varsity. 
</P>
<P>
"I just went in to get rebounds and push people around a little bit. I was in 
there to take up space, I guess," says Klein. 
</P>
<P>
So he was sort of a Bill Laimbeer with a vertical jump? "Yeah," he says with a 
laugh. "I kind of was. I remember I broke two people's noses. I guess I was 
rough." 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for noses everywhere, that foray is over. Now Klein is looking to 
another bridge, the one linking football and volleyball. No one can recall 
anyone who did both successfully in college. Should Jim Klein do it, surely 
he'll be remembered.

There is no going back for eight Ventura County field hockey players who are 
participating in the U.S. Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
At least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
When the competition ends here after the medal games on Friday, they will not 
be going home. They will be leaving for Ipoh, Malaysia, to play for the U. S. 
in the 1989 Junior World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
All 16 members of the U.S. junior team are competing in the Festival. The 
junior team, which consists of players under 21 years of age, will be coached 
by Ric Purser of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The World Cup will be played Aug. 8-19. 
</P>
<P>
Among the players selected were Larry Amar of Camarillo; Eric Von Holtz of Simi 
Valley; Jeff Horrocks of Newbury Park; John O'Neill of Newbury Park; Matt 
Robbins of Camarillo; Taylor Trickle of Camarillo; Benjamin Maruquin of 
Ventura; and Tom Vano, a goalkeeper from Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's competition, the West team, which has 14 County players on its 
15-man roster, dropped a 2-1 decision to the North. 
</P>
<P>
The West (0-1-2) was outshot for the third consecutive game. Amar scored the 
West's goal with 3:12 remaining in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Sykes of Livermore, Calif., scored the game-winner for the North at the 
29:57 mark of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The South, another squad dominated by County players, outshot the East 14-5, 
but lost, 1-0.

STAMS SIGNS FOUR-YEAR CONTRACT;

ONLY THE FIRST-ROUND PICKS HAVE YET TO COME TO TERMS

With no draft choices left to practice on after Wednesday's signing of 
second-round pick Frank Stams, the Rams must now turn thoughts and pocketbooks 
to Round 1, where Bill Hawkins and Cleveland Gary await. 
</P>
<P>
Stams, an outside linebacker from Notre Dame and the highest of the Rams' three 
second-round choices, agreed to a four-year deal and reported to Wednesday's 
practice. The Rams have signed 12 of their 14 draft choices and now dig into 
the men from Miami, Hawkins and Gary. There appears little chance the 
first-round picks will make it in time for the team's trip to Tokyo for an Aug. 
5 exhibition game with the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"Hawkins and Gary seem to be on the back burner," Coach John Robinson said. 
"They are in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Details of Stams' contract were not available, though Stams said his deal was 
at least comparable to second-round choices Brian Smith and Darryl Henley, who 
received similar four-year, $1.1 million deals from the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no doubt it would get done," Stams said. "It was a matter of when. 
My ambition is to play football, not to miss a season." 
</P>
<P>
Stams, who figures to face stiff competition at outside linebacker this season, 
stayed in football shape with some unconventional techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Friday, I went out and butted heads with a tree," Stams said. "No 
helmet." 
</P>
<P>
How much has receiver Ron Brown's stock risen in recent months? The Rams are 
actually toying with the idea of using Brown in the backfield on occasion this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could do that," Robinson said. "It's just nice to have him here in 
the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Same time last year, Brown was retired from football and seemingly headed in a 
trade to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He returned to the Rams in October and 
played in seven games, making two catches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all behind me," Brown said of his troubled past in Anaheim. "I'm here and 
it's going to be a good year." 
</P>
<P>
Brown says he's in better shape now than in 1984, when he captured a gold medal 
in the Los Angeles Olympic Games as a member of the 4x100 relay team. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done a lot of workouts and training," he said. "Normal things that you're 
supposed to do that I hadn't done in prior years." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he couldn't help being motivated by last season's performance of 
best friend Henry Ellard, who led the National Football League with 1,414 
receiving yards and broke Tom Fears' single-season team reception record with 
86, eclipsing the mark of 84 Fears set in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good to see him have a good year," Brown said of Ellard. "He's my 
buddy. He showed you can be a Pro Bowl receiver in this organization. It hadn't 
been done in 18 years." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rookies travel to San Diego on Sunday to scrimmage the Chargers. Coach John 
Robinson said he didn't know if holdout tight end Damone Johnson would make the 
trip to Tokyo. Johnson is under contract but unhappy with his contract, which 
will pay him $200,000 this season. "We're still trying to sort that out," 
Robinson said of Johnson's situation. "We'll try to have something solidified 
in the next day or so." Johnson is looking for a little boost in pay after a 
42-catch season in 1988. . . . More on Frank Stams. Asked if he had any contact 
with the team's first pick, defensive end Bill Hawkins, Stams replied: "Hawkins 
hasn't talked to me since the Miami game." Notre Dame defeated Miami last 
season in a game that ultimately decided the national championship.

James Scott and Steve Larkin of Lawndale were drifting for halibut 500 yards 
off Point Dume in their boat the Ghetto Queen when Scott hooked a 23 1/2-pound 
flat fish on 15-pound test line with cut squid. As he reeled in his catch, 
several blue sharks appeared near the boat. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin cast a baited line to keep the sharks off Scott's catch. One blue bit 
the hook and took off, peeling 100 yards of line. 
</P>
<P>
Scott brought his halibut to the surface and had a net in hand when one of the 
sharks bit off the tail of the catch while taking the line to the bottom. But 
Scott brought the halibut back to the surface and into the net ahead of another 
hungry shark. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin, meanwhile, battled the blue on his line. After 17 minutes he raised the 
shark to the surface. Scott stood ready with a gaff, but the catch snapped the 
line just before surfacing. The blue escaped, just another big one that got 
away. 
</P>
<P>
They estimate that the hooked blue weighed about 80 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
John Darro of the Torrance Rod and Reel Club returned last week from a halibut 
trip to Homer, Alaska, where he won a 25-minute battle with a 76-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Russ and Edna Trager of the King Harbor Marlin Club had an unusual double hook 
that lasted 35 minutes in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California. Russ landed a 
120-pound marlin and Edna brought in a 115-pound catch. 
</P>
<P>
Don Haynes, a member of the same club left Redondo Pier aboard his boat the 
Fisherette and returned with a 63-pound thresher shark caught on cut mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Lehman of San Gabriel, fishing on The Victory, won the jackpot with a 
19-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Venice Anglers Club holds its third annual shark derby Saturday and Sunday. 
Anglers are confined to Santa Monica Bay areas between Palos Verdes Point and 
Point Dume. Target species are blues, threshers and makos. Fishing starts at 
12:01 a.m. Saturday and ends at 5 p.m. Sunday. For information call Mark 
Aguilar 306-3476. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Zamboni of Long Beach caught the whopper of the week, a 32-pound halibut, 
while fishing for bass at Horseshoe Kelp aboard the Southern Cal. Mickey Mario 
of West Los Angeles, aboard the Crest at Catalina Island, hooked a 31-pound 
white sea bass. Joe Bonagoz of Harbor City caught a 27-pound flattie while 
fishing on the Monte Carlo. Hyonch Rackinskie of West L.A. took the ride to the 
Annie B Barge and hooked the first halibut of his life. It weighed 20 pounds. 
Ed Sanders of Gardena was aboard the Queen of Sea when he landed an 18-pound 
yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing reports: 
</P>
<P>
Deep-sea action remains unchanged. Catalina catches of barracuda continue with 
anglers averaging eight fish per rod. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportsfishing, the Spitfire racked up 150 sand bass, 120 
bonito and four halibut. The Betty O rock cod special had 375 groupers. The 
Happyman's two half-day trips netted 335 sand bass, 65 bonito, eight barracuda 
and five halibut. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sport Fishing, the Sea Spray fished Rocky Point and chalked up 328 
sand bass, 68 bonito, seven barracuda and a halibut. The Redondo Special hooked 
130 sand bass, 35 bonito and 27 barracuda on a half-day trip. The Blackjack 
headed to Catalina and had successes of 97 sand bass, 62 bonito, 23 sheepshead 
and a pair of halibut. 
</P>
<P>
At 22nd Street Landing, the First String went to Horseshoe Kelp for 73 
barracuda, 41 bonito, 62 calico bass and seven sheepshead. The Monte Carlo hit 
a school of calico bass at the Rock Pile. Anglers landed 107, plus 11 sand bass 
on the half-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
At L.A. Harbor Sportfishing, the Sport King trip to the oil rigs paid off with 
250 calico bass, 175 bonito, 20 rock fish and 15 barracuda. The Matt Walsh took 
a half-day trip to Horseshoe Kelp for 62 calico bass, 23 bonito and 15 
barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Outer Limits headed to San Clemente and hauled in 107 calico bass, 73 
sheepshead, 21 whitefish, 13 bonito and a trigger fish. The Shogun also went to 
the island and chalked up 230 calico bass, 55 bonito, 20 sheepshead and five 
whitefish. The Annie B. Barge count for the weekend was 710 mackerel, 210 
kingfish, 15 bonito and five sand bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Victory out of Long Beach Sportsfishing went to the Flats and ran into a 
wide-open bass bite. Anglers sacked 462, plus 35 bonito and 31 barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronado at Catalina hauled in 101 bonito, 85 calico bass, 50 sculpin, 
seven sheepshead and a pair of yellowtail. The El Dorado also went to the 
island and logged 121 barracuda and 42 calico bass. The Southern Cal half-day 
trip to the Flats returned 185 sand bass, 11 barracuda and two halibut. The 
Chieftain ventured to Horseshoe Kelp on a twilight trip and anglers sacked 63 
barracuda and 55 calico bass.

ASSOCIATE OF BRADLEY FACES CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Attorney James Hahn today filed a misdemeanor charge against a business 
friend of Mayor Tom Bradley for failing to turn over her records in an 
investigation into her finances and the mayor's. 
</P>
<P>
City Controller Rick Tuttle early this month issued a subpoena to Juanita St. 
John for her records as director of the Task Force for Africa-Los Angeles 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle is investigating a possible conflict of interest between Bradley's role 
in directing city funds to the task force and his private real estate 
partnership with St. John. 
</P>
<P>
St. John, 57, is scheduled for arraignment Aug. 17 in Los Angeles Municipal 
Court on one misdemeanor charge of failing to comply with a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a top-level city investment officer contradicted testimony given 
by his superiors, suggesting that Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg and the other 
key staff member participated in a cover-up of Bradley's role in the investment 
of $2 million in a bank that paid him $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
George Sehlmeyer, an official in the treasurer's office, said cash management 
officer William T. Hoss used correction fluid to paint over a notation on a 
competitive bid sheet that said a March 22 deposit of city funds at Far East 
National Bank was "per the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
He said the words were "whited out" after Rittenberg became concerned when a 
news reporter called him about Bradley's relationship with the bank. Bradley 
served as a paid consultant to that bank in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In a new disclosure, Sehlmeyer also told the City Council's Finance and Revenue 
Committee that Rittenberg was upset with him for volunteering information about 
the reference to city auditors conducting a review of the deposit. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say, 'Why didn't you keep your mouth shut?' " Sehlmeyer said. "He 
said, 'They didn't have anything, why did you tell them that?' " He said 
Rittenberg accused him of being a "terrible poker player" who couldn't play out 
a bluff. 
</P>
<P>
Sehlmeyer also told the committee that the Far East competitive bid sheet may 
also have been doctored about a week after the deposit by someone trying to 
make it look as if he had used the correction fluid. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn and several other city agencies and council committees 
are investigating allegations of conflict of interest and other aspects of 
Bradley's involvement with the bank.

<P>
Santa Ana police arrested three teen-agers, one of whom had fled to the press 
box at a football stadium, after the three allegedly robbed a woman at an 
automatic teller machine and she chased them in her car. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Alphonso Jordan, 18, of Santa Ana was caught at Eddie West Stadium in 
Santa Ana and arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said today. The others, 
ages 14 and 17, were taken to a county juvenile facility, police Sgt. Bob 
Ensley said. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the 14-year-old allegedly grabbed the purse containing $28 from a 
35-year-old Tustin woman about 11:30 p.m. after she had withdrawn money at the 
First Interstate Bank near 17th and Greenleaf streets in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
They jumped in their car and sped off, chased by the victim in her car. A 
police unit pulled her over when the two cars raced by. Another police unit 
sighted the suspects' car after its description was broadcast on the police 
radio, Ensley said.

TENNESSEE NISSAN WORKERS VOTE 2-1 TO STAY OUT OF UAW;

<P>
BIG BLOW TO UNION'S PRESTIGE

Nissan employees rejected United Auto Workers representation by a 2-1 margin 
today, turning back a drive to make their plant the first fully Japanese-owned 
auto factory in the United States to unionize. 
</P>
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board said 1,622 votes were cast against joining 
the UAW, and 711 in favor in balloting that began Wednesday at the plant 30 
miles southeast of Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't give us anything we don't already have," said Dotty Lockhart, a 
29-year-old production technician who voted to keep the union out. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was seen as a test of UAW muscle and a challenge to auto makers' 
strategy of locating plants in the traditionally anti-union South. The union 
had charged that the breakneck pace of production at the 6-year-old plant 
caused a high rate of injury. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks as if the Japanese-owned plants are going to stay non-union," said 
David Healey, an auto analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "As long as 
Japanese-owned plants pay the same wages as the unionized plants the workers 
aren't going to vote for the union." 
</P>
<P>
The UAW afterward accused Nissan of misrepresentation and intimidation during 
the 18-month campaign. The union said company tactics included "captive 
audience" meetings and a barrage of anti-union videos on the plant TV system in 
which the auto maker warned that its members would lose benefits if the union 
won. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like someone was trying to divide our family," worker Redgie Gentry 
said of the organizing drive during a news conference this morning. "We're all 
a family. . . . We didn't want that. We wanted to be all one team." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Benefield, president of Nissan Motor Manufacturing U.S.A., was elated by 
the margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the results of this election are very strong support for the 
participatory management philosophy here at the company and we're very happy 
we're going to continue that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Benefield denied that the pace of the assembly line had contributed to a high 
injury rate and said it is slower than in some UAW-organized assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, UAW President Owen Bieber, Vice President Stan Marshall and 
Regional Director George Smith said, "All this election demonstrates is that 
when a company is determined to operate without a union and is willing to use 
threats and misrepresentation to an unlimited extent, that company can delay if 
not escape its day of reckoning." 
</P>
<P>
In opposing the UAW's campaign, Nissan focused on benefits it already offers, 
such as a reduced-rate car-leasing program and a 401K retirement program, as 
well as on a team concept in which workers rotate jobs as often as every two 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Business experts saw the UAW loss as a crushing blow to the union's chances for 
reversing a decade-long decline in strength. 
</P>
<P>
"This suggests to the world that Japanese companies don't need the UAW. The UAW 
could lose dominance in the industry," said Tom Mahoney of Vanderbilt 
University's Owen Graduate School of Management.

MAYOR ACCUSED OF PUTTING ATLANTIC CITY 'UP FOR SALE'

<P>
Mayor James Usry, a former Harlem Globetrotter who ousted a corrupt incumbent 
in a recall fight and rose to the presidency of the National Conference of 
Black Mayors, was arrested today and charged with taking a $6,000 bribe and 
putting local government "up for sale." 
</P>
<P>
Usry, the only black Republican mayor of a major New Jersey municipality, was 
one of 14 Atlantic City politicians, public officials, and businessmen charged 
after a nine-month undercover investigation of corruption in the oceanside 
casino resort. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, facing various charges of bribery, conspiracy, official 
misconduct and election law violations, also included the City Council 
president, two other council members, a former council member, a county 
freeholder, a freeholder candidate and seven others. 
</P>
<P>
The charges described five separate but overlapping bribery and 
influence-peddling conspiracies that, as a whole, indicate that "the regulation 
of economic activity in Atlantic City, as administered by those arrested, has 
been up for sale," State Police Supt. Clinton Pagano said. 
</P>
<P>
He was accused of taking a $6,000 payoff Friday from a local businessman 
working undercover for the State Police. The bribe was allegedly paid in a 
hospital room where Usry, 67, was recovering from a shoulder injury incurred in 
a gardening accident. It allegedly was in return for Usry's backing a proposed 
ordinance allowing operation of motorized versions of the resort's famous 
Boardwalk "rolling chairs" during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
Usry was a center from 1946 to 1951 with the New York Renaissance, an all-black 
team that became part of the world famous Harlem Globetrotters during his 
tenure. He became Atlantic City's assistant superintendent of schools in 1977.

JUROR'S ANTI-CALIF. BIAS UPSETS VERDICT

A Seattle jury foreman who told fellow jurors that Californians are so "sue 
happy" that they will drag their own mothers into court has given a California 
woman a new shot at winning damages from Safeway Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Supreme Court today agreed unanimously that the juror was biased 
against Californians, and that his failure to disclose the bias during jury 
selection entitled Marie N. Robinson to a new trial to determine damages. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson sued Safeway in 1983 after she was struck on the back by a metal rack 
that fell as she reached into a refrigerated unit. 
</P>
<P>
A King County Superior Court jury in Seattle awarded the woman $9,278, an 
amount Robinson considered inadequate. She sought a new trial on grounds that 
the jury foreman's bias against Californians had resulted in the inadequate 
award. 
</P>
<P>
Upon review, the Superior Court found that the jury foreman, whose name was not 
disclosed, failed to reveal a bias toward Californians even when asked during 
jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
The lower court found that during jury deliberation the foreman said: "These 
Californians sue anyone they can get money from. . . . Californians are sue 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
The court found that the foreman further said: It is "the fast pace, I guess. I 
mean, you don't see the suits in Washington like California. People down there 
sue for anything. Children sue their parents, parents sue their children. I was 
sued for $500,000 because of a car accident" in California.

Elks club members from across the nation voted today against allowing women to 
join their fraternal organization but in favor of a membership rule that could 
make it easier for nonwhite men to join. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Dapelo, the newly installed Grand Exalted Ruler of the Elks, said the 
vote against admitting women was by a show of hands and there was no count. "I 
wouldn't say it was close, not at all," Dapelo said. "I'd say it was 
overwhelmingly defeated." 
</P>
<P>
In St. George, Utah, a woman who was rejected for Elks membership filed a sex 
discrimination lawsuit in 1987 that is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Approved was the proposal to eliminate a rule allowing any three members of an 
Elks lodge to reject, or "blackball," a prospective member. Some said that rule 
made it harder for minorities to join the organization. Under the new rule, a 
two-thirds majority of a lodge's members can approve a new member. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of a resolution to do away with the "three blackball" rule was urged by 
the Lompoc, Calif., Elks Lodge after two black applicants were rejected.

REAGAN'S PLACE IN HISTORY? MIDDLING, SCHOLARS SAY

<P>
Six months after Ronald Reagan left the White House, historians and political 
scientists -- asked to guess how history will rate his presidency -- rank him 
in the middle, between great and dreadful. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Coolidge's name keeps coming up in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"Coolidge was strong for keeping things from being done," said Lewis Gould, a 
University of Texas historian. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Reagan "has elements of F.D.R. in his ability to communicate." But 
he thinks that ultimately Reagan will wind up "in the middle- or lower-middle 
ranks." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Freidel, professor emeritus at both Harvard and the University of 
Washington and a biographer of Franklin D. Roosevelt, did not draw the F.D.R. 
analogy. Instead, he compared Reagan to Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
"Both were total charmers," Freidel said. "Both clung to the same sort of 
small-town Middle Western verities. Both were men of principle. Both to a 
certain extent were hands-off Presidents." 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower biographer Fred Greenstein of Princeton University, on the other 
hand, said Ike never had a scandal like Iran-Contra and never had his 
weaknesses laid bare in kiss-and-tell books like those that have come out about 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Political scientist Thomas Cronin of Colorado College said Reagan "will have to 
be judged as having made a consequence." He gives the former President top 
grades for his ceremonial roles "as the national cheerleader, the national 
chaplain; he was able to rally the American spirit." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Reagan "was insensitive to women's rights, civil rights, 
oblivious to what was going on in his own Administration -- the procurement 
scandal, HUD, Iran-Contra," Cronin said. "An ethical sleaze characterized his 
Administration; it seems a reincarnation of the Warren Harding attitude." 
</P>
<P>
"Great? It's hard to say whether he'll be great," said Henry Graff, a Columbia 
University historian. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see what happens to the economy. He'll get high marks for having been on 
watch when the Cold War began to peter out. For all the bravado and macho 
style, he'll be remembered as one of the peacemakers." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's place will be determined by events yet to happen, several historians 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If Russia doesn't explode and (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev continues his program of 
perestroika and glasnost, Ronald Reagan will have a very significant place in 
history," Freidel said. Political scientist Charles Dunn of Clemson University 
added: "Reagan's reputation historically will fly upon the wings of Gorbachev 
and (George) Bush."

District of Columbia Police Chief Maurice T. Turner, reported to be considering 
a race for mayor, was welcomed into the GOP today by President Bush, who called 
his switch from Democratic ranks "a major step for our party." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and the police chief, who is black, posed for pictures in the Oval Office. 
With Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater seated nearby, Bush 
said: "It's a major step for our party as we try to broaden it out, and have 
the broadest possible appeal, so welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, sources who asked not to be identified told the Associated Press that 
Turner had been approached by GOP officials with promises of campaign support 
if he would make the race against incumbent Democratic Mayor Marion Barry. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm just becoming a member of the Republican Party. I'm not running 
for mayor at this time," Turner said in response to questions.

MOSCOW DENIES LINKS WITH BLOCH; 
</P>
<P>
SAYS U.S. MEDIA RESPONSIBLE FOR NEW 'WAVE OF SPY MANIA' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Soviet government spokesman said today that the Soviet Union has no 
connection with Felix S. Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspected of being a spy. 
</P>
<P>
Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in Moscow that 
allegations that Bloch was a spy for the Soviet Union were a result of a new 
"wave of spy mania" caused by the U.S. media. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said he had made inquiries about Bloch's activities. "The name of 
Bloch was not familiar. We have no connection with him. We have nothing to do 
with him," he told a regular press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
News leaks from unidentified sources in Washington said that there was a 
videotape of Bloch passing a briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris and that the 
same agent later allegedly telephoned Bloch with a warning that he was under 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch has not been charged with any crime, but he has been under surveillance 
in the New York area. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush said today that the Bloch case spotlights a 
continuing concern about improving the nation's counterintelligence 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is 'Can we improve our counterintelligence?' We always ought to 
be striving to do that," Bush told reporters during an Oval Office photo 
session. "Can embassy security be improved? We go through this periodically and 
the answer is, I'm sure it can." 
</P>
<P>
However, the President said he was not "passing judgment" on the Bloch case, 
which remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch today left his father's New York apartment where he had spent several 
days and drove off alone with reporters and FBI agents in pursuit. Bloch said 
nothing to reporters and photographers when he left the Manhattan building 
where his father lives. 
</P>
<P>
As he drove away, he managed to lose most of the pursuing reporters at the 
first stoplight. Others followed him to the home of his daughter, Kathleen 
Swenson, in Chappaqua, about 35 miles north of midtown Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents also followed him and resumed their stakeout.

<P>
The Soviet Parliament today adopted two resolutions paving the way for the 
Baltic republics to have greater control of their economies. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the Supreme Soviet was a major victory for Baltic activists, who 
have accused Moscow of sapping the republics' natural resources and failing to 
help preserve their native cultures. 
</P>
<P>
One resolution would allow Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to trade independently 
with other Soviet republics, Tass said. Under the second resolution, Estonian 
and Lithuanian authorities, instead of officials in Moscow, will decide 
production matters and control how profits are spent. 
</P>
<P>
The resolutions call on the Council of Ministers to draw up draft laws on the 
resolutions and submit them to the Supreme Soviet by Oct. 1 for approval, Tass 
said.

UMW FINED $4.5 MILLION FOR 'TERROR'

<P>
A judge fined the United Mine Workers nearly $4.5 million today for what he 
called "acts of terror" in the coal fields. 
</P>
<P>
Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin Jr., who earlier fined the UMW 
nearly $3 million for violating orders limiting strike activities, blasted the 
union for assaulting and threatening people during the nearly 4-month-long 
strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a feeling of terror throughout much of this area," the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McGlothlin ordered that $2 million of the fines be paid to the state, $1 
million to Dickenson County and almost $1.5 million to Russell County. He also 
ordered that all UMW members be restrained from impeding traffic around 
entrances to Pittston property and from interfering with local traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the fines stemmed from McGlothlin's finding that the union failed to 
stop its members or supporters from forming convoys of slow-driving vehicles 
that have delayed the hauling of Pittston coal. 
</P>
<P>
UMW attorney Mike Passino said he expected the union will appeal.

The nation's two largest auto makers reported lower second-quarter earnings 
today, with Ford Motor Co. profits down 15.7% and General Motors Corp. off 
3.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, the nation's second-largest auto maker, said it made $1.4 billion, or $3 
a share, during the quarter this year, compared to $1.66 billion, or $3.43 a 
share, in the same period of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
GM said it earned $1.45 billion, or $2.23 a share, during the April-June period 
this year, compared to $1.51 billion, or $2.26 a share, during last year's 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
GM and Ford said incentives offered during the quarter put pressure on profits, 
but overseas operations continued to show good profitability. 
</P>
<P>
GM revenue, including its three large subsidiaries, rose 1.3% during the 
quarter to $33.6 billion from $33.18 billion last year. Ford's quarterly 
revenue was $25.9 billion, up 3.7% from $24.96 in the same 1988 period.

Lewis, who competed in the 1985 and '86 Olympic Festivals and watched his 
sister Carol compete at the first festival in 1978, said he is not competing 
here because he feels "it is more beneficial for some of the people who are 
striving. I think it helps their careers."

Lewis said he prays often for Ben Johnson, the Canadian who was stripped of his 
Olympic gold medal for using steroids.

Tom Gentry, a property developer from Hawaii, beat the record set in 1986 by 
British airline and record tycoon Richard Branson by 18 hours, 23 minutes and 
40 seconds
