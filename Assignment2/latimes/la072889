It has only been six months since Ronald Reagan left office, but already some 
historians are willing to guess how history will compare him to other 
presidents. Most put him somewhere in the middle. Lewis Gould, a University of 
Texas historian, compares Reagan to Calvin Coolidge, explaining: "Coolidge was 
strong for keeping things from being done." Gould thinks Reagan will eventually 
wind up "in the middle or lower-middle ranks." But he did give Reagan credit 
for having "elements of F.D.R. in his ability to communicate." A biographer of 
Franklin D. Roosevelt begs to differ. Frank Freidel, professor emeritus at 
Harvard, said: "If I had to rank him right now, I would rank him as high as 
Dwight D. Eisenhower. Both were total charmers. Both clung to the same sort of 
small-town Middle Western verities. Both were men of principle. Both to a 
certain extent were hands-off presidents." Not everyone agrees with Freidel, 
either. An Eisenhower biographer, Fred Greenstein of Princeton, said Eisenhower 
never had an Iran-Contra-type scandal and instead compares Reagan to Ulysses S. 
Grant, a President who, he said, "had substantial public support but left a 
rather messy legacy." Historian Donald McCoy of the University of Kansas also 
called Reagan a hands-off President and said that "he wasn't terrific at it but 
on the other hand he wasn't a failure, either. What shall we say? So-so, 
average, fair."

 -- For the first time in 35 years, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II will enter a 
horse in a race in the United States, said track officials at Arlington Park in 
suburban Chicago. The queen's last entrant in the United States was Landau in

 -- The people of Salem, Mass., are a bit confused about two candidates for the 
City Council. One of them is Jean-Guy Martineau, who holds the 5th Ward seat 
and is seeking one of four at-large seats. Another is Jean-Claude Martineau, 
who is running for the 5th Ward seat that Jean-Guy is leaving. Adding to the 
confusion from their similar names is the reason for that likeness: They're 
40-year-old identical twins. Jean-Claude had been living in Florida but decided 
to enter politics upon his return to Salem because constituents kept mistaking 
him for his office-holding brother. "He got all the complaints and I got off 
free half of the time," Jean-Guy said. DAVE JOHNSON

Argentina's Peronist government will pardon more than 300 army officers who 
were involved in three recent military rebellions, a Defense Ministry source 
said. The source said hundreds of junior officers had faced discharges. The 
uprisings took place in April, 1987, January, 1988 and December, 1988. 
Nationalist officers staged the rebellions to press the government to stop 
trials against military personnel accused of human rights abuses committed in 
the 1970s "dirty war" against guerrillas. Defense Minister Italo Luder appeared 
to confirm the government's leniency toward the lower-ranked dissidents, saying 
they "were given minor disciplinary penalties and were ordered back to their 
postings."

ENVIRONMENTALISTS SPLIT ON LOGGING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK A. STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Environmentalists were sharply split Thursday over a logging plan approved by 
the U.S. Senate, with some praising it as a landmark improvement in forest 
management and others excoriating it as an attack on major environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, part of the Department of Agriculture appropriation for 1990, was 
introduced by Sens. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) and Brock Adams (D-Wash.) to try 
to ease a log shortage that threatens the Pacific Northwest timber industry. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would permit the harvest of 10 billion board-feet of timber from 
Oregon and Washington lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of 
Land Management -- a compromise between industry and environmentalist levels. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also for the first time acknowledges the existence and importance of 
virgin, old-growth forests, which provide vital wildlife habitat, superior 
watershed and exceptional recreation. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, it also restricts how much federal courts can interfere with 
harvest plans that may threaten the forests. The courts would still be allowed 
to review each timber sale but could not stop any one of them without first 
conducting a full trial. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmental groups, such as the Audubon Society and Sierra Club, say the 
old-growth sections are a major step forward in federal forest management. 
Others, including the Wilderness Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, 
say the legal restrictions severely weaken existing environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in history, they are giving legal protection to old 
growth," said Audubon Society Vice President Brock Evans. "They defined what 
old-growth is and are telling the Forest Service to stay out of it whenever 
possible. . . . We think substantial progress has been made." 
</P>
<P>
"It is completely unsatisfactory," rejoined Wilderness Society spokesman 
Richard Hoppe. "The Senate bill will give the Forest Service the authority to 
ignore all the major environmental legislation that regulates its activity." 
</P>
<P>
"It is an invitation to illegal action and a license to commit it," added Vic 
Sher of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Club, which operates separately from the 
Sierra Club itself. 
</P>
<P>
Both environmentalist camps said they would try to strengthen the bill when a 
conference committee reconciles differences in Agriculture budgets passed by 
the House and Senate. Over the last two years, environmentalists have won 
sweeping federal court injunctions to protect old-growth from being cut because 
logging appeared to threaten the northern spotted owl with extinction. Those 
orders have blocked more than a fourth of federal timber sales in Oregon and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The timber industry blames this for a log shortage that has closed at least 30 
mills and threatens to close many more by this winter. But others have said 
mill consolidation, automation and raw-log exports are to blame.

Leaders of the international environmental group Greenpeace said Thursday they 
would sail two vessels into a military test area off Florida in an effort to 
disrupt a test launch of a Trident 2 missile from a submerged submarine, which 
they said is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
The first submarine launch of a three-stage, 126,000-pound Trident 2 ended in a 
spectacular failure in March when a malfunction in the missile's nozzle system 
sent the $26.5-million rocket cartwheeling out of control seconds after launch.

The Navy does not discuss such tests, typically conducted about 50 miles east 
of Cape Canaveral, before they take place.

EXPOSURE TO DEATH AIMS TO SAVE LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The judges and the therapists call it "reality education," but for the seven 
young adults who sat through the coroner's slide show, it was disgusting, 
gross, extreme -- and, they conceded, effective. 
</P>
<P>
The group spent Thursday morning at the coroner's office looking at graphic 
photographs of twisted, broken and torn bodies of people killed in traffic 
accidents, domestic violence or suicide. These victims had either been drinking 
or were stone sober, killed by someone who had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
There was the woman who stepped outside the restaurant to fetch her sweater 
from her car, herself not totally alert because she had a drink in the bar 
while waiting for her table, who was struck by a drinking driver outside the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
There was the inebriated motorcyclist who impaled himself after rear-ending a 
truck that he came up on too fast. 
</P>
<P>
There was the baby beat to death by a drunk parent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Got Home 
</P>
<P>
There was the school teacher who never got home from work, his vehicle struck 
head-on by a drinking driver. 
</P>
<P>
There was the chronic drunk who finally put a gun to his head. 
</P>
<P>
There was the man who, filled with liquor and acting on a dare, jumped into a 
lion's cage and was mauled. And the man who drank himself to death on the 
kitchen floor, his alcohol turning to poison as it shut down his body. 
</P>
<P>
It was all there -- in scenes so gruesome that some of these young people 
couldn't stand to look. A veteran therapist who had seen the 
</P>
<P>
slides several times before lowered her head and looked down into her lap in 
anticipation of what the next slide would show. 
</P>
<P>
This was not stock driver's education footage most of us might remember from 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
When County Coroner David Stark asked after his slide show if there were any 
questions, there was only silence. 
</P>
<P>
"This was hard-core stuff," finally said one young man who, like the others, 
asked not to be identified by name. "But I guess that's what this is all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Said a blond teen-age girl from Del Mar, "I don't think I ever want to get in a 
car again." 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old Marine said he wouldn't stop drinking beer at the clubs on base 
at Camp Pendleton -- where the drinking age is 18 -- but he added, "If anyone 
says they think I've had enough, I'll turn my car keys over to them and walk 
home." 
</P>
<P>
The seven, all between the ages of 18 and 20, had been convicted, or pleaded 
guilty, to various types of drinking-and-driving offenses in Vista Municipal 
Court. And, acting on recent state legislation, some Vista judges not only 
imposed the normal sanctions of probation, a fine and perhaps a day or two in 
jail depending on the offense, but went one step further. 
</P>
<P>
They ordered these seven -- and about 50 others since May -- to participate in 
a private therapy program that includes not only counseling, but also a 
presentation by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), a four-hour shift in a 
hospital emergency room and the graphic slide presentation, showing the 
ultimate penalty of drinking and driving, presented cooly and matter-of-factly 
by Stark. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
500-Word Essay 
</P>
<P>
These drinking drivers are then required to write a 500-word essay on their 
feelings and reaction to the program and to reflect on the offense they 
committed, then attend a final group counseling session where they will hear 
one another share their thoughts on the program and on the consequences of 
drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
The program began three months ago in North County and is too young to measure 
hard results. But in other counties in California where judges are employing 
the same sanctions, the recidivism rate has dropped somewhat, officials report. 
</P>
<P>
"This is reality-based education on the twin evils of drinking and driving," 
said Vista Municipal Court Judge David Ryan at a recent press conference 
discussing the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We want these people to see that they are killing themselves at an alarming 
rate and are taking out the rest of us, too," Ryan said. "We want to lock in 
their behavior with the human suffering, that pain and suffering and misery, 
that is part of drinking and driving." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan credited the San Diego chapter of MADD with bringing the state legislation 
to his attention, and pressing him to take advantage of it when sentencing 
young adults guilty of drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Roark, president of MADD in San Diego County, said some of the youthful 
offenders who attend the organization's panel discussion appear reluctant 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
"They come in with their arms crossed, slouched, looking down at the floor or 
up at the ceiling," she said. "But, after we show them pictures of the car and 
pictures of my incomplete family, their expressions begin to change. It's like 
they start to listen with their ears." 
</P>
<P>
One such participant agreed. "I thought I'd have to deal with a lot of mothers 
who would be trying to make me feel guilty," said one girl from Del Mar, who 
left a beach drinking party and was stopped by a sheriff's deputy for swerving. 
She had a blood alcohol content of 0.15%. A level of 0.10% is legally 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
"But their presentation really hit me hard, especially when she talked about 
the funeral for her son." 
</P>
<P>
For others, the most moving experience of the program is the visit to an 
emergency room or Palomar Medical Center's trauma center in Escondido. "You 
ought to see the damage that's done to people," said a 20-year-old who was 
stopped for an equipment violation -- a broken headlight -- but was suspected 
of having been drinking. He had a blood alcohol level of 0.10% at the time and 
was arrested. "I'm always going to be thinking about those sights in the 
emergency room, the damage that can be done. It sticks with you." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fred Hammell, director of Palomar's trauma center, said program 
participants who visit the emergency room are struck by "the smell of alcohol 
and dirty socks, the screaming and yelling, the rearranged bodies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Company 
</P>
<P>
The program is coordinated in North County by a private company, Occupational 
Health Services, which offers similar programs throughout California. Most of 
its work is for employers who contract with the company to assist employees in 
dealing with alcohol and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Occupational Health Services is one of four companies in San Diego County 
providing a variety of therapy programs for drinking drivers, ranging from 
juveniles to repeat adult offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Judges who support the program, which is still not widely known and used in 
Vista Courts, have so far sent about 50 violators, 18 to 20 years old, to 
Occupational Health Services. The violators pays a $60 fee and are counseled at 
the outset to determine their attitude toward drinking and how open they are to 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Some adults are defensive or are still in denial about their drinking, but the 
kids are open and frank. They're really up front about what happened to them, 
and that they have to deal with it," said Dee Launt, who co-manages the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"The visitations (to emergency rooms or the coroner's office) are not designed 
to traumatize them, but to have an impact on them," she said. "They need to 
know what they're dealing with when they drink and drive." 
</P>
<P>
The final essays are read by the judges but are not returned to the author for 
six months, when they are mailed to him as a kind of reminder of the 
experience. "It's a shameful experience for them, and they express remorse in 
their letters," said Barbara Aday, who coordinates the program with Launt. 
"But, lots of time, that shame goes away, and we want to remind them of their 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
In the compositions, the writers frequently reflect on the consequences that 
drinking and driving will have on their families and careers, Aday said. 
</P>
<P>
The counseling session which wraps up the program is valuable, said coroner 
Stark, because "they're not usually too kind on each other. One will say to 
another, 'C'mon, stop shining us on.' " 
</P>
<P>
But, for most participants, the component with the greatest impact is the 
coroner's presentation. There was not, as some had expected, a tour of the 
morgue and the sight of bodies opened for autopsies. That, said Stark, would 
not be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Here to Hassle' 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Stark talked in numbers and in percentages about the carnage of 
drinking and driving, and relied on unsanitized photographs and his detailed 
commentary to carry his message. For the slide of the motorcyclist who impaled 
himself, Stark said simply, "You'll see that his heart was torn out." 
</P>
<P>
He told of how relatives are notified when a family member is killed in an 
accident. Turning to a young Marine in the group, Stark said dryly, "You're 
easy for us. All we've got to do is tell your commanding officer. Then your 
parents will see three people at their front door -- a chaplain, an officer and 
an enlisted man. And they'll know why." 
</P>
<P>
Stark told the group, "We're not here to hassle you about some incident that 
put you here. We're here to instill a sense of responsibility in the adult 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy you came here through the front door. I've seen faces like yours 
come through the back door, and, after 20 years, it's getting kind of 
disgusting."

LA JOLLA-SANTEE ROUTE'S FINAL LINK APPROVED BY STATE PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State transportation officials Thursday approved the final 10-mile stretch of 
California 52 that will eventually link Interstate 5 in La Jolla with 
California 67 in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in San Francisco, the California Transportation Commission approved the 
project's environmental impact statement, clearing the way for the $335-million 
roadway scheduled to be completed in four stages by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed route will begin at Santo Road, in Tierrasanta, near Interstate 
15, skirt the north side of Mission Trails County Park, before turning 
southeast, crossing over Mission Gorge Road, Cuyamaca Street and Magnolia 
Avenue to California 67. Caltrans offi cials said construction plans include 
interchanges at those streets and Mast Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
California 52 now runs from Interstate 5, through University City, under 
Interstate 805, to Interstate 15 in Tierrasanta. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Jim Larson said construction of the freeway strip is 
expected to begin in the summer of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, we're talking of getting to 125 in about five years," Larson said. 
An extension of California 125 is under construction from Interstate 8 north 
through La Mesa, El Cajon and Santee, where it will intersect the California 52 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officials Ecstatic Over Approval 
</P>
<P>
Larson said local Caltrans officials were ecstatic over the commission's 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy as a lark," he said. "It's been a long, drawn-out process. There 
has been a tremendous effort by our employees to put together this program. 
We're already in the starting block."1 
</P>
<P>
Construction and approval for California 52 had progressed at a snail's pace. 
The project was approved by the Legislature 30 years ago. The first segment, 
from Interstate 5 to Interstate 805, was approved in 1962, but it was not 
completed until 1970. The second segment, linking Interstate 805 with 
Interstate 15 and Santo Road, was approved in 1972 and opened 16 years later, 
in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Larson, noting that the final 10-mile link is not expected to be completed for 
another 14 years, said: "In freeway work, we look that many years ahead." 
</P>
<P>
The last major hurdle, approval of an environmental report, took five years to 
complete, transportation officials said. Several routes were considered before 
the commission narrowed the number to three alternatives, then to the final 
plan approved Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$150 Million for Property 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials said about $150 million of the project's $335-million cost 
will be spent on acquiring property, rights of way and resettlement costs. 
Another $11.7 million will go to build a 77-acre habitat in Mission Trails 
County Park for the least Bell's vireo, which is on the endangered species 
list. The final environmental report also included a realignment of the roadway 
to avoid vernal pools near Santo Road. 
</P>
<P>
Initial plans for the new strip call for a four-lane freeway that will 
eventually be widened to six lanes, Larson said. Once completed, California 52 
is expected to reduce traffic on Interstate 8 by 20%. Caltrans officials said 
some sections of Interstate 8 now carry about 270,000 vehicles a day. 
</P>
<P>
The new road is also expected to ease congestion on Mission Gorge Road and 
other surface streets that connect Santee and San Carlos with Interstate 15.

BUCKEY ADMITS TO HAVING ADULT PORNOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Buckey testified Thursday that "nothing improper ever happened at the 
preschool" but acknowledged at the McMartin molestation trial that he used 
adult pornography for sexual gratification. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, brought up the pornography issue during the 
chief defendant's second day on the witness stand in the complex marathon 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
He showed Buckey a series of sexually explicit photographs that had been found 
during a police search of his parents' home five years ago, as the sensational 
case was first breaking. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old defendant said he kept the pictures in his bedroom under the 
dresser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Somewhat Embarrassing' 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want people to see them," he said. "They're somewhat embarrassing, I 
think." 
</P>
<P>
"What did you use these pictures for?" Davis asked. 
</P>
<P>
"To look at," Buckey said quietly. "Sexual gratification, masturbation." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you ever take them to the preschool?" the attorney asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Buckey replied. 
</P>
<P>
He said he never showed the pictures to anyone and thought they were his 
secret. His father has testified that he knew about the pictures, having found 
them by accident. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with 64 counts of 
child molestation and a shared count of conspiracy stemming from activities at 
their McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach. Now in its 27th month, their 
trial is the longest criminal proceeding on record and has cost over $15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, stressing that Buckey's pictures had nothing to do with child 
pornography, asked the defendant why he tried to flush them down the toilet 
when the police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said he believed that a Manhattan Beach police investigator, who was 
pressing the case against him, would "make a big issue about my having adult 
pornography." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think she needed any help in fabricating a case against me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specific Children 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Buckey took the stand and said he had never molested children, 
killed animals or committed other acts alleged by nine child witnesses. In 
Thursday's questioning, Davis referred to specific children and allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"Did anything improper happen while she was there?" he asked about one girl's 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing improper ever happened at the preschool," Buckey said adamantly. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why he went to work at the family school in 1981, Buckey said he 
thought he would like to be a preschool teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't you see something wrong about a male at the preschool?" Davis asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all. . . " Buckey said. "I don't see anything inappropriate about a 
male working with children." 
</P>
<P>
Davis asked Buckey to explain a number of items seized from his parents' home, 
among them a yellow, long-nozzled hair dryer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question Asked 
</P>
<P>
"Did you ever use that at the preschool?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Buckey said. 
</P>
<P>
"To molest children?" Davis asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Buckey answered. 
</P>
<P>
"To frighten them?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," he replied again. 
</P>
<P>
"What did you use it for?" Davis asked. 
</P>
<P>
"To defrost the freezer," Buckey said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: A DIFFERENT BATTLE CRY FOR MARINES: HIT THE BOOKS! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Summer is the time for reading lists. 
</P>
<P>
The glossy magazines have them. The feature sections of the newspapers have 
them. Even Barbara Bush issued a pitch for summer reading. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is an unlikely entry in the reading derby: Marine Corps Commandant 
Gen. Alfred M. Gray. 
</P>
<P>
If Gray has his way, the modern Marine will be equally proficient with his M-16 
and his library card. Gray issued an order that all Marines shall begin reading 
from an approved reading list. 
</P>
<P>
Gray's books mostly deal with fighting and great battles. "Catch-22" and "The 
Naked and the Dead" didn't make Gray's list, but "The Red Badge of Courage," 
"War and Peace" and "All Quiet on the Western Front" did. 
</P>
<P>
"Marines fight better when they fight smarter," Gray said. He ordered all major 
bases, including Camp Pendleton, to ensure that noncommissioned officers read 
two books a year and officers four to six. 
</P>
<P>
The list includes the classic works of military strategy (S.L.A. Marshall, 
Thucydides, Mao, Sun Tzu, Von Clausewitz) and military biography (Patton, 
MacArthur, Rommel). 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, there is a local angle. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Krulak's memoir, "First to Fight," is on the list. He's a retired Marine 
lieutenant general who lives in Rancho Bernardo, spent a decade as an executive 
with the Copley Press and now writes occasional commentaries for the Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Gray also believes in learning from defeat. On the list for officers are Neil 
Sheehan's book about Vietnam, "A Bright Shining Lie," and a guerrilla 
perspective by North Vietnamese Gen. V. N. Giap, "How We Won the War."Bets, 
Bats and Hackers 
</P>
<P>
Notes from me to you. 
</P>
<P>
* There's nothing to the rumor that the Del Mar Race Track observed a moment of 
silence on opening day for Pete Rose. I checked. 
</P>
<P>
* The Padres' batboys have new orders: Stand up straight during the National 
Anthem. A recent feature story showed two of them slouching during the pregame 
anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Public reaction was swift and negative. The batboys' boss was not happy. 
</P>
<P>
* A UC San Diego engineering graduate named Josh Parker has started a computer 
software firm called Keyboard Comedy for hackers in need of merriment. Just pop 
in a disk. 
</P>
<P>
Sample joke: "Dan Quayle always said he would have scored higher on the SATs if 
the guy in front of him had worked harder."Junking Legal Jargon 
</P>
<P>
John Seitman, a San Diego lawyer, has discovered something. 
</P>
<P>
The words hereinbefore, forthwith, adjudged, hereafter, aforementioned "and the 
ever-popular whereas" are not used much in common discourse. Only in the 
written expression of lawyers do such teeth-rattlers flourish. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Board of Governors of the State Bar, Seitman decided that it 
is time for the legal profession to tame its tendency toward the arcane and 
archaic. 
</P>
<P>
He prepared a three-page paper for the board. Included was an example of 
foliage that he says needs pruning. 
</P>
<P>
"Tenant has not at any time heretofore made, done, committed, executed, 
permitted or suffered any act, deed, matter or thing whatsoever, whereby or 
wherewith, or by reason or means whereof, the said lands and premises hereby 
assigned or surrendered, or any part or parcel thereof are or is, or may, can 
or shall be in any wise impeached, charged, effected or incumbered." 
Translation: The tenant has done nothing to get the landlord sued. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Los Angeles, the bar board unanimously adopted a three-part motion 
(without a single whereas) urging all lawyers to use simple English, making 
sure all State Bar documents for the public use simple English and writing an 
"English can be fun" pamphlet for lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the hard part: persuading the state's 117,000 lawyers to embrace 
clarity. 
</P>
<P>
Seitman, 47, whose clients are banks and thrifts, has high hopes. Lawyers, he 
said, like to get results and are eager to cast off excess baggage.

TWO YOUTHS ARRESTED IN BASEBALL-BAT ATTACK ON 9-YEAR-OLD BICYCLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police arrested two youths on suspicion of attempted murder Thursday 
night in connection with a brutal attack on a 9-year-old boy who had been 
riding a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
The two boys, 16 and 17, were being held in Juvenile Hall, San Diego Police Lt. 
George Saldamando said. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua Garrett was struck in the head Wednesday with a baseball bat by someone 
in a passing car. He was in serious condition but improving Thursday, 
Children's Hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made after another 16-year-old turned himself in to Chula 
Vista police about 4 p.m. Thursday, Saldamando said. San Diego police were 
notified, and the youth gave detectives the identities and addresses of the 
other two. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Felt Real Bad About What Happened 
</P>
<P>
"He felt real bad about what happened and said he had no knowledge about what 
the other two were going to do," Saldamando said. The youth was in the back 
seat of the car when the 17-year-old said that "he felt like hitting someone," 
Saldamando said. 
</P>
<P>
As the car the youths were riding in pulled up beside Joshua, the 17-year-old, 
who was seated on the passenger side, struck the boy, Saldamando said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an isolated, vicious attack," Saldamando said, adding that the attack 
was not believed to be gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
The three youths all live in the South Bay, he said. San Diego police arrested 
the two boys without incident at the home of the driver of the vehicle. The boy 
who turned himself in was not arrested and was released to the custody of his 
parents, Saldamando said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's mother, Theresa Garrett, and other relatives kept an all-night 
vigil Wednesday night at the boy's bedside at Children's Hospital, which first 
had listed him in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
When the boy regained consciousness early Thursday morning, Joshua "asked for 
water and a $1 bill" that had been in his pocket at the time of the attack, 
Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victim Awoke and Asked, 'Where's My Dollar?' 
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy. He knew who I was," she said. "He looked much better. All he 
kept asking about was 'Where's my dollar?"' 
</P>
<P>
Joshua suffered a skull fracture, concussion and internal bleeding, hospital 
spokesman Mark Morelli said. It will be a few days before physicians know 
whether Joshua suffered brain damage, Morelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had not yet questioned the boy about the attack, Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua had been in a coma since being taken to the hospital by Life Flight 
helicopter Wednesday afternoon, Morelli said. He carried no identification, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Maddox, a retired nurse, found the boy lying in a ditch in front of her 
house in the 1600 block of Hollister Street, across from Southwest High School. 
Maddox had been alerted by two other boys about 12:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua "had a knot the size of a fist" on the back of his head and was bleeding 
from the mouth, Maddox said. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to talk to him, but he wasn't consciously aware of what was going on 
around him," Maddox said. "I just tried to keep him from going into shock." 
</P>
<P>
After Joshua was taken to the hospital, Maddox was walking her dog about 4:35 
p.m. when she ran into Garrett, whom she did not previously know and who was 
looking for Joshua. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox described the boy and the bicycle to her, noting Joshua's "unusual 
flattop haircut." A neighbor had kept the boy's bicycle and belongings. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox "showed me the bike and his shirt, and I couldn't believe it. I still 
can't," Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Has Considered Moving Out of District 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, who also lives on Hollister Street a few blocks from where Joshua was 
found, said she had considered moving out of the area before the attack because 
of concerns for the safety of her children. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua, a fifth-grader at Harbor View Elementary School, is the second of 
Garrett's three children. Garrett said there is substantial gang activity in 
the neighborhood, which is near Nestor. 
</P>
<P>
"This has just got to stop," she said. "It don't make no sense. I don't know 
why they (would) be doing something like this, I just don't know."

THUNDERSTORM HITS EAST COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lightning and thunderstorm, that lashed parts of Arizona with winds gusting 
to 70 m.p.h. blew into East San Diego County Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
National Weather Service Forecaster Wally Cegiel said the storm roared from 
Mexico up to Anza Borrego Desert State Park including Julian, Mt. Laguna and 
the deserts. It arrived in Imperial County about 7:30 p.m. and in East County 
about 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cegiel said the weather service hadn't been able to determine the severity of 
the storm late Thursday, but that it was expected to end around 10:30 p.m. 
There were reports of a few downed telephone lines in Imperial County, where 
the winds were expected to reach 60 m.p.h., he said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood and severe-thunderstorm 
warning for East County and western Imperial County Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sudden storm, the weekend weather is expected to be an extension of 
the fair days San Diego has had so far this week, but humidity will be slightly 
higher, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide temperatures will be close to seasonal, and skies will be slightly 
hazy after the early-morning low cloud burn-off, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Daytime highs at the beaches will range from 68 to 73 through the weekend. The 
ocean water temperature is 68 degrees and the surf is at 2 to 3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Highs of 74 to 80 along the coast today, and 1 or 2 degrees lower Saturday and 
Sunday are forecast. Overnight lows are to be 60 to 66. 
</P>
<P>
Inland highs will be from 82 to 92 today and from 80 to 90 the rest of the 
weekend. Lows will range from 55 to 62, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains will be warm and partly cloudy through the weekend, with a chance 
of late afternoon thundershowers.

FIELD HAND FUDGES WITH INS FOR SAKE OF FAMILY, LANDS IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manuel Acosta Robles is a hard-working, religious field hand from Mexico who 
was dedicated to improving the life of his wife and two children, according to 
the U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
"His family always came first," said Rudy S. Garcia, an INS special agent in 
Calexico. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to the INS, Acosta's fealty to his family has now landed the 
34-year-old Imperial County resident in jail. Acosta is serving a 90-day jail 
term at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego for a conviction 
arising from his ill-fated attempt to gain legal entry for his family. 
</P>
<P>
Once the sentence is completed, the INS says, Acosta and his family will 
probably be returned to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
As happens so often, the Acosta family was divided by the often-traumatic 
immigration process. He tried to mend the division, but the INS says he 
violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
The INS provided the following version of his case: 
</P>
<P>
Acosta was admitted to the United States legally in late 1980, based on a 
petition filed by one of his parents who was a legal U. S. resident. However, 
Acosta told the INS at the time that he was single, and for a good reason: he 
could not have been admitted under immigration laws if he had acknowledged 
being married. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the INS says, Acosta was married in Mexico in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, the INS says, Acosta submitted an application to become a U. 
S. citizen. As a citizen, he could legally bring his wife and children into the 
United States within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta probably could have qualified for citizenship, the INS says, but he was 
caught in a contradiction. As part of the application process, he submitted a 
copy of his marriage certificate, demonstrating that he had actually been 
married when he told the INS he was single. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with making false statements to the INS, Acosta agreed to plead guilty 
Monday to a single count of entering the United States illegally.

NOTHING SURPRISING HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's extension of the "voluntary" restraints on steel imports is 
hardly surprising. He had made it a campaign promise as he nailed down support 
in the industrial states. He has served notice that this is transitional. All 
protections will be terminated in March of 1991. And, in proposing a 30-month 
continuation, he has wisely resisted industry pressure for a five-year 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment the restraints will have no practical consequence because 
imports are substantially below the 18.4% of market share provided under the 
1984 limits which, in turn, will be the base share under the Bush plan. The 
international economic slowdown that is being forecast may change that picture, 
with the prospect that American steelmakers could again confront a flood of 
lower-priced foreign products. A slowdown could compound the problem for major 
steel-consuming American enterprises, whose ability to compete in world markets 
would be hurt by limits on cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
The most constructive element of Bush's action is the incentive to encourage 
participation by other nations in a global consensus terminating steel 
subsidies. The market share for imports will be increased 1% a year, with the 
increased share going first to nations giving up subsidies. The continuation of 
government subsidies in a number of competing nations was cited as a major 
factor in the President's decision. Admittedly, however, there is no definition 
as yet of what constitutes a subsidy. Some American steelmakers, like some of 
their foreign competitors, have benefited from indirect and direct subsidies, 
although not on the scale used by some nations. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is not saying what he will do in 1991 if he has not been successful in 
winning international agreement to do away with subsidies. He could reaffirm 
his own commitment to free trade if he were to say, as he sends his proposal to 
Congress, that all restrictions would be lifted at that time on those nations 
that have dropped subsidies. That would certainly have been a better response 
at this time than continuing the universal import restrictions that punish 
equally those trading with subsidies and those without.

DEBATE OVER RAIL LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Offerings for sale of Southern Pacific and Santa Fe rail line rights of way is 
a timely opportunity that should not be missed by the Los Angeles 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
These rights of way can provide a nucleus for development of a modern rail mass 
transit system throughout the county that is critical to our area's future, 
moving large numbers of people efficiently, helping reduce air pollution and 
preventing gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
The former Pacific Electric Red Car rail system utilized some of these same 
rights of way, and was excellent, fast and efficient and provided the needs for 
many commuters. 
</P>
<P>
The dismantling of the rail service was initiated and completed by the 
shortsighted greed of special interests, which was later confirmed by 
congressional inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
For those concerned with the noise factor, may I point out, modern rail 
technology offers a quieter mode of transportation than automobiles, buses, 
trucks and motorcycles.

DEBATE OVER RAIL LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why can't the citizenry of Los Angeles County show some foresight and guts? We 
now have the opportunity to purchase rights of way for a basic transportation 
system from the railroads. Yet some are adamantly opposed to doing anything 
except maybe "study" until the idea is dead or it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time to act. In five or 10 years the cost will be five or 10 times 
greater and the transportation smog problem in the basin will be further away 
from a solution than ever. 
</P>
<P>
If the idea is not feasible, the County Transportation Commission can sell the 
property for an enormous profit and spend it on some other system.

DEBATE OVER RAIL LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky is dead wrong to oppose a cost-effective 
and efficient passenger light rail line along Exposition Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
While problems such as traffic congestion on streets and freeways and pollution 
throughout the region beg for solutions from our political leaders, this 
elected official prefers the most expensive alternative available, a subway 
under Wilshire Boulevard from Los Angeles to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The "Wilshire Alternative" is no solution. 
</P>
<P>
When will we elect officials who will galvanize regional consensus on solutions 
rather than polarize parochial views into regional paralysis?

<TEXT>
<P>
In reading your article regarding transit ("Rail Lines Offered for Sale Are 
Focus of Transit Debate," by Ronald Taylor, Metro, July 18), I couldn't help 
but notice the comments of Westwood resident Steve Kunin. 
</P>
<P>
If he doesn't believe we should use existing rights of way for rail 
transportation, what does he propose we do about the congestion on our 
freeways, surface streets and neighborhoods? We got rid of the old rail system 
to, among other things, build more freeways and that "solution" has run its 
course. 
</P>
<P>
In stating that rail transit isn't needed, he is ignoring the cheapest, most 
convenient alternative to a congestion problem the rest of us believe exists. 
</P>
<P>
Steve, maybe the next time you are stuck in traffic along Santa Monica 
Boulevard Westwood you could look down between the medians that separate the 
street. It may be hard to believe but at one time those rails carried scores of 
passengers from the Eastside to the Westside and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
If the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is allowed to purchase 
these rights of way, maybe we can someday ride that line and others like it 
again.

COUNSEL FOR THE COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By proposing that the City Council committees investigating 
conflict-of-interest charges against Mayor Tom Bradley be empowered to take 
testimony under oath, Council President John Ferraro has acted decisively and 
in the public's interest. When his motion, which also would enable the 
committees to hire special legal counsel and issue subpoenas, comes before the 
full council on Tuesday, it deserves the support of every member ready to place 
the people's welfare ahead of his or her political comfort. 
</P>
<P>
This week's testimony before the council's Finance and Revenue Committee 
already has produced disquieting revelations. Among the most troubling is the 
fact that someone in City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg's office altered 
documents indicating that the mayor gave instructions to deposit public money 
in a bank that employed him as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The full significance of these facts remains unclear because the witnesses have 
told the committee and city auditors fragmentary and conflicting stories. It is 
the purpose of sworn testimony to sort out such conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores' suggestion that the council convene 
a single committee to explore all the questions arising from Bradley's murky 
financial dealings is a sound one. The most efficient way to do that would be 
to combine both three-member committees with jurisdiction in this matter -- 
Finance and Revenue and Government Operations -- with Ferraro sitting as a 
seventh member. That body ought then to hire an experienced, distinguished, 
nonpartisan lawyer to direct a thorough investigation, including the public 
testimony of witnesses under oath. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and City Atty. James K. Hahn, who is conducting his own inquiry into 
this matter, have objected to the prospect of a vigorous council probe. Their 
reservations should not prevail. Hahn's efforts cannot provide the credible and 
definite results required. In a situation touching on the basic integrity of 
city government, the people of Los Angeles need clear answers and not simply 
another set of unsettling questions.

A FULL MEASURE OF HEROISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Day-to-day life would be immeasurably harder and perhaps even unendurable if we 
weren't able to take for granted a lot of things, among them that the crews of 
the airliners we fly know their business. The safe end of an air journey seldom 
brings even a passing thought of appreciation for the skills of those who flew 
the plane. Only during and after those mercifully rare times when emergencies 
occur and special and even extraordinary efforts are called for are we apt to 
recall how often and with what implicit and absolute trust we temporarily place 
our lives into the hands of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
When United Air Lines Flight 232 took off from Denver on the afternoon of July 
19, Alfred C. Haynes, Dudley Dvoark, William R. Records and Dennis Fitch were 
strangers to virtually all the passengers aboard. A few hours later, for many 
of them, the four men were their saviors. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes was the pilot, Records was the first officer, Dvorak the second officer, 
and Fitch was an off-duty United pilot who lent two strong hands when their 
DC-10 suffered an engine explosion and loss of hydraulic controls. Somehow, 
working together, they were able to steer the crippled plane to a crash 
landing. The crash took the lives of 111 people. But, seemingly against all 
odds, 185 of those aboard survived. They lived not because Haynes and his 
colleagues followed the procedures for dealing with such an emergency -- no 
such instructions exist -- but because, faced with a crisis they stayed calm, 
they called on their extensive experience, they improvised. Haynes said at a 
press conference a week after the crash that there were no heroes in the 
cockpit. He was wrong. Cool professional competence under terrifying pressure 
is as good a definition of heroism that we know of. There was a lot of heroism 
aboard UAL Flight 232. Because there was, 185 people beat some pretty long odds 
and are alive today.

WILL WEST AND THE WORLD BUILD ON DECENCY, OR ON EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson was a Democratic candidate for 
President in 1988. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Western European nations prepare for integration in 1992, two 
dramatically different conceptions of the new economic and social order in 
Europe are taking shape, with important consequences for the world. 
</P>
<P>
All sides perceive that with the Cold War limping to an end and Soviet and 
Eastern European markets opening up, the prospects for continental economic 
expansion will be substantial. The question is: What kind of pan-European 
society will emerge from the coming boom? 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's vision is of unrestricted freedom 
for business to invest capital all over the continent. She envisions business 
inducements, high-rise profits and skyscraper corporations. But she makes no 
provisions for the progress of Europe's working people. She imagines a new 
Europe built like the Eiffel Tower but with a very shaky foundation. 
</P>
<P>
This Europe would look like the Britain of the 1980s, where 10 years of 
conservative government have increased social disparities and allowed the 
business class to consolidate extraordinary power over working people. One 
disturbing trend in Britain is so-called flexibilization, which uses part-time, 
free-lance, on-call and temporary workers as well as unorganized home workers. 
By 1985, according to a study by the British government, one-third of all 
workers and half of all working women fell into this easily exploited 
non-unionized secondary labor market. 
</P>
<P>
The opposing vision of the new Europe, associated with French President 
Francois Mitterrand, also includes free markets but insists on a base line of 
democratic rights for citizens to a livable wage, workplace democracy, adequate 
health care, excellent schools and decent housing. Having grown up with the 
sight of the Eiffel Tower, President Mitterrand knows that the base must 
correspond proportionally to the height if the structure is to endure. Any plan 
for high-rise profits without a foundational commitment to the working people 
on whose shoulders the system rests will be doomed to collapse in the first bad 
wind. 
</P>
<P>
President Mitterrand thus wants to promote a European community that is not 
just a free-trade zone but an international society whose citizens are 
committed to a decent life. Competition, yes, but community also. Without a 
social contract that includes all Europeans, Mitterrand believes that European 
governments will be driven to try to "outbid" one another for new capital 
investment by destroying the hard-won gains of working people. Fierce 
competition for capital, without corresponding protections for labor, will 
plunge working Europeans into a vicious downward spiral of wage and benefit 
losses, immigration crises, racial tensions and personal unhappiness. 
</P>
<P>
This downward spiral for working people feared by President Mitterrand has 
already begun in the United States, where unionized workers struggle to protect 
their modest gains not only against pressures from right-to-work states, but 
pressures from oppressive sweatshop nations like Indonesia and Singapore. 
Meanwhile, 10 years of Republican rule have delivered the pathologies 
accompanying social polarization: Appalling levels of homelessness and 
illiteracy, a health crisis for 37 million uninsured Americans, devastation of 
the nation's inner cities and a loss of moral values manifested in insider 
trading, government corruption and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Eyeing other opportunities for a fast buck, many private American corporations 
now simply want to call off the bargain between business and labor. For 
example, in 1987 the Pittston Co., which operates mines in the coal fields of 
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, refused for the first time to be bound by 
industrywide collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
It tried instead to shove down the workers' throats a Thatcher-type contract, 
allowing it to sub-contract jobs, eliminate long-established job rights, compel 
miners to work on holidays and Sundays, weaken health and safety provisions, 
reduce take-home pay for some workers, extend working hours and reduce 
health-care benefits, which are crucial to the people who risk their lives 
underground every day pulling coal from the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Then Pittston refused to enter into arbitration, later even turning down an 
offer by the governor of West Virginia to mediate. Their families' health and 
livelihood threatened by the rapaciousness of the corporate profiteers, their 
backs against the wall, the miners went out on strike. More than 2,000 of them 
have been arrested for civil disobedience. Despite the Thatcherite assault on 
their rights by the corporate lawyers who Ronald Reagan turned into judges, 
they have hung in there, true working-class heroes. 
</P>
<P>
But the odds against them are stacked with the Republican-dominated courts and 
most politicians far more interested in the freedom of capital than the freedom 
of human beings. 
</P>
<P>
That is why I think President Mitterrand has an important point in his debate 
with Mrs. Thatcher. If we don't develop a new social contract that guarantees 
the rights of labor, then the corporations -- in pursuit of profit wherever 
labor power is weak -- are going to roll over working people. Democracies must 
stop the one-sided class warfare and the economic violence that is being waged 
by corporations against working people. 
</P>
<P>
I would only take President Mitterrand's plan for a new social contract one 
step further. To be effective and to be just, we cannot pretend that what 
happens in Europe and America affects only Europeans and Americans. For the 
21st Century, we need a declaration of basic human rights for workers all over 
the world.

PETE ROSE SITUATION HAS GIAMATTI DOWN BUT NOT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite what most people have come to imagine, A. Bartlett Giamatti is not the 
commissioner of Pete Rose, but rather the commissioner of Major League 
Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
And, Giamatti is happy to say, the commissioner's office and the man who 
resides in it are both functioning quite well despite "it" -- as Giamatti often 
refers to the ongoing court drama concerning his investigation of Rose's 
alleged gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti was quite relaxed throughout the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies 
here. Though he's constantly asked if there is terrible pressure dealing with 
the Rose issue, he says no. To define pressure, he harkens back to his days as 
president of Yale University and a prolonged, bitter strike that divided that 
New Haven, Conn., campus. There, Giamatti said, "plenty of things happened in a 
very concentrated community that aren't necessarily cakes and ale." 
</P>
<P>
The Rose situation "is not pleasant," he said. "Nobody pretends it is. But this 
is not the worst pressure I've ever felt. The whole situation is more sorrowful 
than angry, more unpleasant than hard. The choices aren't hard, such as what to 
do if you're going to end up being taken to court. You get good advice, listen 
to it and make up your mind." 
</P>
<P>
What Giamatti does not do is angrily blame former Commissioner Peter Ueberroth 
for leaving office during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never complained about timing and I'm not going to start now," Giamatti 
said. "I have no complaints about Mr. Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to start off a new job that one has been looking forward to for 
six months with this sadness. And it is a sadness -- human, institutional, 
cultural sadness. But it's also a fact of life. So you go with it." 
</P>
<P>
While he waits, Giamatti also works, disputing the notion of a bunker mentality 
he feels was created by television cameras camped outside his office. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't sit there and worry about 'it' every day," he said. "How could you? 
When I have a hearing and have to reach a judgment, then I'm going to have to 
spend a lot of time on it. But in the meantime, I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
So what else has he been doing since taking office April 1? 
</P>
<P>
First, Giamatti reshaped the commissioner's office to better deal with other 
pressing matters, he said. And in a primary move, brought in deputy 
commissioner Francis "Fay" Vincent of Greenwich, Conn., who had previously been 
chief executive officer at Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti and Vincent, longtime friends from their college days in Connecticut, 
began mapping out a five-year strategy on other baseball issues as long ago as 
September -- before Giamatti was elected by major-league owners but thought 
that he might be, the commissioner said. That forethought he now considers a 
godsend, "because we wouldn't have been able to start on April 1 in that 
strategic mode and do this, too," he said, referring to Rose. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, he says there is ample time for other issues, such as labor, 
international baseball, equal employment, ballpark environment, new-found 
relationships with network affiliates and drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
"Labor is not my sole reponsibility, but it has been something I am working to 
learn and absorb," Giamatti said. 
</P>
<P>
The basic agreement between the players' union and management expires at the 
end of the season. But, cautions Giamatti, "If there's a lockout or a work 
stoppage or a strike, don't come running to the commissioner because I'm not 
going to stand around pretending to have a power that I don't have. We (in the 
commissioner's office) are not the PRC (Player Relations Committee, the 
management negotiating team)." 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti does stay in touch with all parties, however, because he believes that 
will help keep the outlook positive. 
</P>
<P>
International baseball also occupies a great deal of Giamatti's time, 
especially since the game is to become a medal sport at the 1992 Olympics. He 
requested that no international television rights be awarded during the winter, 
when contracts with CBS-TV and ESPN were settled. "I wanted to aggregate as 
much of the rights and the licensing because it was obvious to me that baseball 
is going to grow in places it had not grown before," Giamatti said. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the international plan: promotion of amateur baseball 
worldwide. Why? "Whatever one learns about bringing amateur baseball worldwide 
can be reapplied at home," Giamatti said. "One of the things that concerns me 
the most is the refurbishment of talent in the face of competition from other 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
As for equal opportunity, Giamatti has implemented a plan requiring all clubs 
to turn in forms pertaining to hires, on the field and off. "I want to know who 
the finalists are for the jobs of senior significance," he said. "So that 
information comes to me. I'll be monitoring the forms and making my own 
judgments." 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti's office also monitors minor-league random drug testing. By year's 
end, 1,800 to 2,000 tests will have been administered. As for testing at the 
major-league level, Giamatti said he's always found the players union willing 
to talk, yet doesn't see it as a negotiating issue. "I do hope we can talk 
about it and hopefully sometime reach an agreement," Giamatti said. 
</P>
<P>
One issue Giamatti can and will force is that of environment. Giamatti says he 
sensed a deterioration in public arenas the past eight to 10 years. "Baseball 
and every other public place for public pleasure had better start paying 
attention to parking lots, restrooms, quality of ushering, scoreboard noise 
and, at the core, alcohol," he said. "I construe this as the most serious, 
long-term business problem." 
</P>
<P>
Other duties include the ceremonial sort, such as attending everything from the 
celebration of Little League baseball's 50th anniversary to the Hall of Fame 
inductions.

SHOW MUST GO ON FOR DURAN AND LEONARD

Uno mas, con gusto? Or, here they go again, ad nauseam. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar Ray Leonard, aka The Show That Never Ends, was back on Broadway Wednesday 
to explain why, nine years after the fact, he should once again fight Roberto 
Duran, once known as "Hands of Stone" but now more of a fighting fossil. 
Appropriately, the affair was held at Roseland, the ancient midtown ballroom 
frequented by aging hoofers. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing leads to another, years go by, and things change," Leonard said. 
"This is indeed a rubber match. Roberto Duran is the only man to ever beat me, 
and he beat me fair and square. I beat him the second time, but because of the 
bizarre ending, people thought it was all a setup for a third fight. Now he 
owes me one and I owe him one." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as promoter Bob Arum said, "It is unusual in life to get a chance to redeem 
one's past mistakes. In November, Roberto Duran will get his chance." 
</P>
<P>
Arum was careful not to say exactly when or where Duran's day of redemption 
will come. As of Wednesday, a bidding war between potential sites was still 
going on. According to a Top Rank source, the bout was likely to end up in 
Atlantic City on Nov. 30, bankrolled by Donald Trump. Caesars Palace, which 
preferred a Nov. 2 date, was insisting on a two-fight package and a third 
entry, the new Mirage hotel in Las Vegas, wanted to host the fight in December. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever it winds up, Leonard-Duran III, a scheduled 12-rounder for Leonard's 
WBC super-middle-weight title, is the latest in a continuing series of overdue 
grudge matches involving boxing's Seniors Tour, consisting largely of Leonard 
(35-1-1), Thomas Hearns, Duran (85-7), and, some still believe, Marvelous 
Marvin Hagler, who has not fought since Leonard outpointed him in April, 1987. 
The Leonard-Duran saga appeared to be played out on Nov. 25, 1980, when Duran 
turned his back on Leonard in the eighth round of their rematch with the words, 
"No Mas." Five months earlier, Duran had dealt Leonard the only loss of his 
career. Now 38, Duran shocked the boxing world in February when he beat Iran 
Barkley to win the WBC middleweight crown, his fourth world title. 
</P>
<P>
"I've waited nine years to get this opportunity," said a chubby Duran through 
an interpreter. "I always hoped this fight would come. I always had images of 
it. I never lost hope that I would get Leonard again." 
</P>
<P>
Then Duran, who sported a dangling diamond earring in his right earlobe, tried 
English to get his point across. "For nine years, no happy," he said. "Me happy 
now, very, very happy. In November, I be very more happy." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard and Duran were friendly Wednesday, in contrast to their first two 
bouts, when Duran grabbed every opportunity to insult Leonard, even going so 
far as to curse at Leonard's wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of that's going to happen this time around," Leonard said. 
"We both are older now, a lot older. We need to reserve some energy for the 
fight."

The long shadow cast over the Charger organization by the availability of Bobby

</P>

Ever since Beathard left the Redskins last winter, Spanos has talked of meeting 
with him to discuss the possibility of hiring him in an unspecified capacity 
with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
There was even strong speculation inside the organization that Spanos would 
hire Beathard and relegate Steve Ortmayer, the team's director of football 
operations, to a lesser role. 
</P>
<P>
But when Spanos finally spoke with Beathard recently, Beathard told him he had 
accepted a one-year deal with NBC to do once-a-week television commentaries on 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"He just told me that's what he wants to do right now," Spanos said. "It's a 
disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
Spanos reiterated that the team's position hasn't changed on contract 
negotiations with quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver, their unsigned second-round 
draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers maintain that Tolliver's agent, Vic Vines, is asking for too much 
up front in the way of bonuses. Vines said Wednesday that the Chargers yanked 
their offer off the bargaining table just when he was beginning to think the 
two sides had a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Spanos said the Chargers will stand firm on their offer. But he refused to 
underplay the critical nature of the negotiations. "That's the most important 
one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The only other unsigned rookie is first-round pick Burt Grossman, a defensive 
end from Pittsburgh, who was blissfully unaware of Spanos' remarks Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman said one of the reasons he remains unsigned is because he took so long 
to get an agent. Actually, Grossman switched agents from Richard Woods to 
Robert Jackson about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking by phone from his home in Pittsburgh, Grossman admitted he was getting 
"antsy" to get into camp. But, he said, "I'm not getting so antsy that I'll go 
into camp for second-round money." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Lynn, the Charger defensive coordinator, is antsy to get Grossman into pads 
to observe him in live scrimmage situations. But he understands that Grossman 
has to do what he has to do.

Jay Bell, batting .128, hit a three-run pinch triple that capped a five-run 
seventh inning Thursday as Pittsburgh defeated the New York Mets, 10-8, for the 
Pirates' first three-game sweep in New York in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Bell tripled off relief ace Randy Myers as the Pirates, who wasted a 5-0 
first-inning lead, won their fifth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed something like that," Bell said. "They are a great team, and this is 
something we can build on."

The last time the Pirates swept a three-game series in New York was April 
28-30, 1981.

TEAMMATE'S BAD BREAK OPENS DOOR TO U. S. TEAM; 
</P>
<P>
HEAT FORWARD JEFF HOOKER GETS HIS CHANCE TO PLAY, COMES UP WITH MIXED FEELINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a three-year absence from the U.S. national soccer team, Jeff Hooker knew 
he would need a break, any kind of break, to play in a World Cup qualifying 
match this year. 
</P>
<P>
He got it. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a painful break for Billy 
Thompson, Hooker's running mate in the front line of the Torrance-based Los 
Angeles Heat. 
</P>
<P>
On July 2, Thompson suffered a clean fracture of his right tibia while taking a 
shot in a game between the Heat and the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks. It was a 
freak injury. Thompson was alone on the San Francisco wing ready to shoot, but 
his shin bowed when he planted, and he was lost to the Heat -- and the national 
team -- for at least six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson had been slated to be one of the forwards on the U.S. team for its 
World Cup qualifying match against El Salvador the following week. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was Hooker, then the hottest player in the Western Soccer League, 
who got the call from national team officials. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Hooker, the El Salvador game was indefinitely postponed when 
soccer's international hierarchy, the Federation Internationale de Football, 
couldn't agree on a stadium for the match. 
</P>
<P>
So Hooker replaced Thompson in New Britain, Conn., last week on the American B 
team for a Marlboro Cup tournament. But he didn't get the chance he wanted to 
show his coaches what he could do. 
</P>
<P>
He twisted his ankle in training, then played only 30 minutes of both games -- 
the first a 1-0 victory over a team from Northern Ireland and the second a 3-0 
shelling at the hands of the championship team from the Polish professional 
league. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, the U.S. team circled into a defensive shell by the time 
Hooker checked in at forward. And in the second game, the Americans were worn 
down when Hooker entered, and the hopes for a comeback against Poland -- and of 
Hooker getting any shots on goal -- were slim. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the chance I was waiting for," said Hooker, 24. "But I ended up with 
mixed feelings. I guess it worked out well for the team, but individually not 
so well." 
</P>
<P>
So Hooker is waiting for another break. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, when Hooker was 19, he was a rising star and a well-known face 
on the national team. He had been one of the most highly touted prep players in 
the nation at Walnut High School and was a dazzling forward as a freshman at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker wore the U.S. colors in the 1984 Olympic Games and again in 1985 when 
the Americans failed to qualify for the World Cup under national team Coach 
Alkis Panagoulias. In 1984 Hooker was one of only four American amateurs on the 
Olympic soccer squad -- the rest were drawn from the erstwhile professional 
North American Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
He played in front of 78,000 cheering fans at Stanford University when the U.S. 
routed Costa Rica, 3-0, in its first Olympic preliminary round match. But for 
Hooker and the rest of the American team, the Olympics ended in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
In the second preliminary match, Pietro Fanna's second-half goal led Italy to a 
1-0 victory over the U.S. at the Rose Bowl. In the third game, the Americans 
dueled Egypt to a 1-1 tie -- but the Egyptians sat on the ball for much of the 
second half and moved into the quarterfinals ahead of the U.S. by scoring more 
goals in the round. 
</P>
<P>
For Hooker, more disappointment followed. After 1985, Panagoulias was gone, 
replaced by Lothar Osiander, who brought a host of new faces with him. Hooker 
admits he let himself down -- and his chance of sticking with the U.S. team -- 
through a clash of personalities with Osiander. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been with the national team so long, I guess I took things for granted," 
he said. "I wasn't playing at the top of my game. But I also had a bad 
attitude. After a while, it didn't matter how well or how badly I played, I 
wasn't going to play for Lothar." 
</P>
<P>
Hooker's discipline slipped, and with it his standing with Osiander. He was 
snubbed time and again when invitations went around for national team berths. 
</P>
<P>
But this spring, Hooker decided to let his play speak for itself. With Bob 
Gansler, a new coach, in charge of the national team's quest for a spot in 
Italy for the 1990 World Cup, Hooker figured he might open some eyes again. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to play this season (with the Heat) with the idea of getting hot and 
getting back on the national team," Hooker said. "Scoring a lot of goals is the 
most obvious way to get noticed." 
</P>
<P>
He did just that. In the Heat's offensive scheme, Hooker is the target man up 
front, with his back to the goal, taking balls at his feet and playing them out 
to other attackers, or spinning into the box himself. He's responded with seven 
goals and five assists, and he leads the team in scoring with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the flashiest player on the team," he said. "I'm not the type of 
player who's going to step over the ball three times and put it into the back 
of the net and make the crowd go crazy. And I'm not all speed and skill like 
Billy Thompson." 
</P>
<P>
But Hooker is a solid piece of the Heat's winning puzzle. He has scored a pair 
of goals in a game twice this season -- once in 102-degree weather at Tempe, 
Ariz., against the Arizona Condors when he was battling the flu. 
</P>
<P>
The second time Hooker turned the trick was against Real Santa Barbara, and 
with his first goal of that game -- a breakaway through Santa Barbara's defense 
in the 28th second -- he scored the fastest goal in league history. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the key to our offense," said Heat Coach Bobby Sibbald. "He's what makes 
things run for us. Even though he's not very big, he's very tough to take the 
ball away from." 
</P>
<P>
Hooker is looking for another invitation to the national team -- there is 
another Marlboro Cup scheduled for Los Angeles in August and Hooker hopes his 
name will be on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideal situation would be to play well through the WSL playoffs, get an 
invitation and then play well and carry it over from there," he said.

<P>
Carol Davidson will return home to North Hollywood with three U.S. Olympic 
Festival medals, but not the one she wanted most. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson, 30, won a medal in every event -- except women's singles. Arditch 
Lonnon of St. Paul, Minn., knocked off Davidson 21-18, 9-21, 13-21, 23-21, 
21-16, in the quarterfinal round Thursday night at Oklahoma Christian College's 
Payne Field House. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson was the second-highest-ranked player in the Olympic Festival field. 
Only Li Ai of Colorado Springs, Colo., was rated higher, and Davidson had 
already defeated her once in team competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ai later defeated Lonnon to win the gold medal, 21-12, 21-14, 21-13. 
</P>
<P>
"With this field I felt I should have won the tournament," Davidson said. 
"Normally I can hit, but I played too defensive. I didn't play smart." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson advanced to the quarterfinals with a perfect record in pool play. 
</P>
<P>
She defeated Kristey Reed of Enola, Pa., 21-11, 21-8; Donna Sakai of Lanham, 
Md., 21-17, 21-14; and Kerry Terrel of Richland, Wash., 21-11, 21-15. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson, the 1986 U. S. women's amateur singles champion, has won nine medals 
-- two golds, one silver and six bronze -- in five Festival appearances. 
</P>
<P>
This year, she won a gold medal in women's doubles and bronzes in the team and 
mixed doubles events. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
For the second match in a row, the North team, with Coley Kyman at middle 
blocker, won its first game then lost three in a row. This time it was the West 
that took advantage for a 6-15, 15-5, 15-13, 15-12 victory at Lloyd Noble Arena 
in Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Kyman, a two-time City 3-A player of the year at Reseda High who will be a 
freshman at Cal State Northridge in the fall, was second on the North with 15 
kills. He also had a team-high two service aces and a stuff block. 
</P>
<P>
TEAM HANDBALL 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Fruin, Kevin Withrow and Mike Hurdle combined to score 12 goals for the 
West, but the South pulled out an 18-14 win at the State Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Fruin, from Camarillo, had five goals; Withrow, from Thousand Oaks, had four; 
and Hurdle, from Reseda, added three. 
</P>
<P>
FIELD HOCKEY 
</P>
<P>
The two teams dominated by Valley-area players -- the West and the South -- 
will battle for bronze today. 
</P>
<P>
The North defeated the West, 2-1, on a penalty stroke shoot-out at Cameron 
University in Lawton, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
The North's opponent in Friday's gold-medal game will be the East, which scored 
four second-half goals to defeat the South, 4-2, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Derek Wallace, a former Chatsworth High standout, took the loss as the East 
turned 13 hits and five errors into a 13-2 victory over the West at All Sports 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The East, which will play the North in Saturday's gold medal game, was paced by 
Doug Hecker of Wantgh, N. Y., and pitcher Rob Mosser of Oley, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Hecker went 4 for 5 with two doubles, two triples and five runs batted in. 
Mosser pitched a three-hitter and retired 18 in a row from the third inning 
through the eighth.

SAN DIEGO'S RILEY MAKES THIRD ROUND IN A HURRY 
</P>

<P>
Speed was the main topic of conversation during the second round of match play 
at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championships at Singing Hills Golf Course Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
And the talk didn't involve the greens. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Riley, a 15-year-old from San Diego, had just finished the front nine of 
his second-round match in 65 minutes. That's 7.2 minutes per hole in a sport 
that traditionally uses everything but cattle prods to get competitors to play 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
But it seems Riley's penchant for fast play is well known among San Diego 
junior circles. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit out of turn five times," Mel Skelley said of a junior tournament 
earlier this year in which he scored for Riley. "He just gets tired of waiting. 
Either he'll revolutionize the game, or someone will slow him down." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Stutts nearly stopped Riley in his tracks by rallying from a 6-hole 
deficit with seven holes remaining to trail by one going to the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
"The last hole, I couldn't believe that he was coming back," said Riley, a 
freshman on the Madison High School team that won the San Diego Section title 
this year. "I think I was forcing it. I was worrying more about him than 
playing my game." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, who defeated Rob Booth of Gladwyne, Pa., 4 and 3, in the first round of 
match play in the morning, was 4-up after his whirlwind nine holes against 
Stutts. 
</P>
<P>
Riley went 6-up after 11 holes and looked to have an insurmountable lead. But 
Riley bogeyed 12 and 13 to fall back to 4-up. 
</P>
<P>
Stutts birdied the 15th and then made two pars to cut the lead to a single 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
But Riley gathered himself on the 170-yard, par-three 18th. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw his shot go over the green," Riley said. "I just wanted to par it. If he 
birdied it from there, he deserved to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Riley didn't take any chances. His tee shot landed three feet from the pin, and 
he made the putt to advance to the third round this morning at 7. 
</P>
<P>
And having the opening tee time suits Riley just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to be the first person out on the course," he said. "I like to play 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
His morning round was completed in two hours 15 minutes, but that went just 15 
holes. Riley also lost a big lead in that match: He was 5-up, then lost three 
out of the next four holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I should slow down," Riley said. "I concentrate, but I could concentrate a 
little more. But that's just the way I am. 
</P>
<P>
"I play ready golf." 
</P>
<P>
Riley is believed by tournament officials to be the youngest player to earn 
medalist honors. He was involved in another first Wednesday when four tied at 
one-over 145 after 36 holes of medal play. All shared medalist honors. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the medalists -- Riley and Brian Gay of Daleville, Ala. -- remain 
after Thursday's rounds. The other two medalists lost in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Worth of Des Moines, Iowa, lost, 4 and 3, to Notah Begay III of 
Albuquerque, and Chris Edgmon of Edmond, Okla., was defeated, 3 and 2, by David 
Duval of Ponte Vedra, Fla. Edgmon was the first-round leader with a 68.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: THE BOWERY THEATRE FINDS 
THERE'S ROOM AT THE INN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There are love matches in corporate heaven, says Lee Julien, the Kingston Hotel 
partner who lobbied fellow investors to provide the Bowery Theatre a new space. 
</P>
<P>
Julien calls the relationship between the theater and the hotel "synchronistic, 
almost a miracle. We bought the hotel about 90 days ago. It all came together 
at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
It began when Julien inquired about arranging parking for the hotel with John 
Howard, the president of Ace Parking. Howard, then president of the Bowery's 
Board of Trustees (he's since been succeeded by Richard Madsen), brought the 
plight of the homeless Bowery to Julien's attention. Julien had pursued a 
doctorate in theater at Stanford in 1969, before he dropped those studies to go 
into real estate. The Kingston had a space; the Bowery needed one. Julien was 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
But could he persuade other general partners that it made sense to loan a 
space, worth $3,000 a month, rent-free -- and underwrite utilities costs of 
roughly $400 to $500 a month? The hotel had a history of bankruptcies and 
foreclosures under its former name, the Executive. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't hurt that the major investor was another theater buff, Malcolm 
Kingston, chairman of the West Coast drive to raise money for the restoration 
of the Old Globe Theatre in England. Kingston came to the opening of the 
Bowery's "Italian American Reconciliation" and liked it well enough to give 
Julien's idea the thumbs-up. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingston Playhouse was born. 
</P>
<P>
"The experiment to see whether private enterprise can support the arts and 
still benefit is an interesting one. A lot of people will be watching to see if 
it works out -- me among them," Julien said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
His partners "want to see some benefit," he said. "There is a benefit in 
supporting the arts, of course. We're having an increase in food and beverage 
sales. The possibility exists that we may experience an increase in room sales 
eventually. I'd like to promote our hotel as a theater hotel." 
</P>
<P>
But the best part, said Julien, who joined the Bowery's Board of Directors last 
week, is that 20 years after the doctorate he never got around to writing the 
dissertation for, he has found a way to reunite avocation with vocation. He can 
see the benefits for the Bowery, which just announced its first full season 
ever, beginning with "What the Butler Saw" in September and ending with 
"Teibele and Her Demon" in March. And he appreciates those less tangible but 
still rewarding benefits for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's proof that you can finally do what you love to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whither the San Dieguito Playhouse? The 31-year-old community theater just lost 
a succession of spaces, from its old home at the Del Mar Fairgrounds, where it 
had to strike and rebuild its stage every year around racing season, to a site 
at the La Paloma Theater, where it had to strike and rebuild its stage before 
and after each of La Paloma's daily movies. Now the St. John's Catholic Church 
in Encinitas has given it a building, but with a catch. The group must find a 
space to put it on; the 44-by-80-foot site has been sold to a developer. Escrow 
could be settled by the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
"Community theater is an endangered species," said Norma Payne, president of 
the playhouse's Board of Trustees. Given the rising price of land, most 
theaters must be underwritten to survive, she explained. Community theaters, 
which produce non-professional shows with all-volunteer staffs, often find it 
hard to compete with professional theaters for funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on the City Council agenda," said Payne, who hopes to be producing 
"Painting Churches" and "A Christmas Carol" this year. 
</P>
<P>
"All we are asking for is somewhere we can move the building. We would be 
responsible for maintenance. If we could find a donor, we would be happy to 
name the theater after him." 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: The Ensemble Arts Theatre has passed the critical point in its 
fund raising for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe '89, Aug. 13-Sept. 2. But it has 
raised enough to take only one of the two shows it initially planned on: Sam 
Shepard's "Angel City." Ensemble Arts plans to produce the second play, "Water 
Music," by UC San Diego playwright Michael Erickson, in November in San Diego, 
and has scheduled "Angel City" for a Sept. 28 opening here in a yet-to-be 
announced location. Among the Edinburgh-bound is Linda Libby, the 
longest-playing member of the "Six Women With Brain Death" cast. She left the 
ensemble Sunday after starting with the show in October, 1987. . . . Paul 
Harter, a real estate investor in Los Angeles, moved to Coronado with his wife, 
Ione, four years ago. This year, he gave a deferred gift valued at $1.2 million 
to the Old Globe Theatre. The money, according to the Globe, will be used to 
help provide rehearsal and creative space for artists and staff; to establish 
long-term support for a variety of programs, including the University of San 
Diego Master of Fine Arts program and Teatro Meta, and to help retire the 
$500,000 deficit incurred as a result of the Festival Stage fire. Recently, the 
Harters donated more than $4.75 million to the Zoological Society of San Diego. 
. . . The Sunday matinee performance of the La Jolla Playhouse's "Dangerous 
Games" at the Mandell Weiss Center for the Performing Arts will be interpreted 
for the hearing-impaired. Deaf actress Freda Norman will give a free 
pre-performance discussion at 1 p.m. Holly Boursier and Norman's husband, Rico 
Peterson, do the signing. Twenty-five discount tickets will be available to the 
hearing impaired at $8 apiece. The TDD (Telecommunication Device for the Deaf) 
number is 534-0351. . . . The military audience is up for the La Jolla 
Playhouse production of "Nebraska," the Keith Reddin play about the servicemen 
who baby-sit missile silos. The playhouse finds that a large number of people 
are asking for those $2 military discounts. . . . The Old Globe Theatre will 
begin selling tickets to the general public Sunday for the American premiere of 
"Brothers and Sisters," the Maly Drama Theater production that may well be the 
highlight of the San Diego Arts Festival in October. The tickets may seem 
pricey at $75 to 125, but the two-part, six-hour epic drama about Soviet lives, 
loves and backbreaking labor under Stalin's iron hand, should not be missed. 
Next week, the tickets will be advertised in the L. A. market. . . . Josefina 
Lopez's touching, semi-autobiographical play, "Simply Maria: Or the American 
Dream," winner of the 1988 Young Playwrights Competition at the Gaslamp Quarter 
Theatre Company, has been scheduled for broadcast from 4-5 p.m. Sept. 17 on 
KPBS-TV (Channel 15).

HANKS AND HIS DOG CHARM IN 'TURNER AND HOOCH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Tom Hanks stares testily or fondly at his co-star in "Turner and Hooch" 
(citywide), a Dogue de Bordeaux named Beasley, you can sense a real connection. 
And when Beasley stares back -- wattles matted with froth, huge red eyes in a 
Winston Churchill-ish glower -- these two actors seem to have genuine respect 
for each other's abilities. Hanks shrieks; Beasley cocks his head. Hanks pants; 
Beasley barks. Hanks kvetches; Beasley sniffs. Hanks flinches; Beasley jumps on 
him and chomps jovially at his throat. 
</P>
<P>
They work together with the seeming near-telepathic sensitivity of longtime 
vaudeville partners. It's good that "Turner and Hooch" has this chemistry at 
its center, due to the actors and to Beasley's ingenious trainer, Clint Rowe, 
because it's another movie that seems stranded without a script, somewhere 
south of the last deal and east of the fifth rewrite. Shot mostly on Terminal 
Island, it's the story of Turner, a small-town pier cop in a coastal city who 
inherits the obstreperous pooch Hooch after his master (John McIntire) is 
knifed in the aftermath of a nearby murder, leaving the faithful dog as sole 
eyewitness. 
</P>
<P>
This catastrophe binds together Turner and Hooch in a variation on "The Odd 
Couple," with Hanks the equivalent of nippy perfectionist Felix and Beasley as 
another slob Oscar: guzzling beer, swilling whiskey, expectorating, expelling 
gas, destroying cars, chasing females and otherwise behaving like Walter 
Matthau unleashed. There is another love interest in "Turner and Hooch," a 
beautiful feisty veterinarian (Mare Winningham) who pops up as if by magic; she 
also, conveniently, has a gorgeous collie. But, basically, Beasley and Hanks 
are the whole show. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, it's not a bad show at that. One reason "Big" worked well was the 
unself-conscious way that Hanks projects boyish qualities of enthusiasm, 
curiosity, petulance, candor, spontaneity. He really looks and acts like a kid 
at heart, and, in this movie, he looks like a fussbudget of a kid who needs a 
good, big, sloppy dog to warm him out. The production team behind them, with 
director Roger Spottiswoode and virtuoso cameraman Adam Greenberg ("Near 
Dark"), gives "Turner and Hooch" crispness and pace. Spottiswoode's movies are 
always beautifully edited, and there's a sheen to the images: When Beasley 
shakes his jowls, slow-motion sweat and drool fly off him like sunlit beads in 
a beer commercial. 
</P>
<P>
The basic plot of a man-dog team tracking criminals, suspiciously similar to 
the April release "K-9," with Jim Belushi and German shepherd Jerry Lee, 
suggests that modern movies don't actually influence each other but somehow 
break out all at once, like epidemics. Tender relationships like the one 
between Turner and Hooch, full of delicate interplay, compassion and robust 
fellowship, aren't really being created for men and women, "When Harry Met 
Sally . . ." honorably excepted. 
</P>
<P>
But the co-stars can distract you only so much. Three separate screen-writing 
entities -- the teams of Dennis Shryak &amp; Michael Blodgett ("Rent-a-Cop") 
and the ubiquitous Jim Cash &amp; Jack Epps Jr. ("Top Gun") plus executive 
producer Daniel Petrie Jr. -- seem to have canceled each other out. There are 
hints of Petrie's talent for zippy badinage, traces of Shryak-Blodgett's Gothic 
cop cliches. Finally, everything seems to get smoothed over by Cash and Epps, 
the great homogenizers: two writers who could probably take "Anna Karenina" and 
flatten it out into "Vronsky and Me." 
</P>
<P>
As a bunch, the film makers have created the sort of mystery story that might 
well puzzle a 12-year-old who had never read a mystery story before and wasn't 
paying attention anyway, and the sort of love story that 12-year-olds might 
throw away to read the mystery story, along with the sort of dog story many 
dogs would actually enjoy -- if the pages were edible. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily the team of Hanks and Beasley are around to save the show, tell a few 
snappy stories, dance a few licks, chase a few crooks, make you laugh, make you 
cry. Who needs writers? Hanks has his charm; Beasley has his barks. Everything 
else is counterpoint. One thing though: Speaking as an old dog-lover, 
especially of Samoyed mixes, I don't like the ending of "Turner and Hooch" 
(MPAA-rated PG, despite violence). Movies may actually be going to the dogs 
these days, but that entails certain rules and responsibilities. MICHAEL 
WILMINGTON

PREVIEW: ALWAYS RADICAL KPFK TO AIR 30-YEAR HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1959 free, public radio -- without commercials -- was a radical idea. Thirty 
years later, non-commercial radio has found large listening audiences and 
mainstream respectability, but the public station that first broadcast over Los 
Angeles airwaves in July, 1959, is still considered by many to be radical 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
Those who associate KPFK solely with the politics of the left might be 
surprised to discover that in its early days, KPFK was as likely to give air 
time to conservatives William Buckley and Howard Jarvis as to Dorothy Healy, 
head of the Communist Party in Southern California. It was also opposed to rock 
and folk music. Classical music filled the time between discussions of foreign 
policy and local politics. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sounds and the Fury," a radio documentary that airs at midnight Monday on 
KPFK (90.7 FM), reveals those early voices and more in an exploration of the 
history of the North Hollywood-based station. What emerges is a picture of 
often-conflicting words that portrays KPFK less as a bastion of liberalism than 
a station that, throughout its existence, has been committed to freedom of 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
According to observers and past and present staff members, this commitment to 
free speech -- spoken mostly by a diverse assortment of unpaid volunteers -- 
has been the strength and weakness of KPFK. 
</P>
<P>
"We were defining non-commercial KPFK at the very moment it was being 
broadcast," the voice of former staffer Mitchell Harding explains during the 
documentary. "That's still going on, and that may be why it seemed to sound 
somewhat the same throughout the years. It does have a KPFK . . . sound . . . 
not so much non-professionalism as enthusiasm. People coming in because they 
felt as though it were a movement. And that has pitfalls, but it's also the 
reason the station renews itself." 
</P>
<P>
The well-publicized pitfalls of KPFK's free radio movement have involved 
external and internal politics. During the McCarthy era, the station was 
investigated by the Senate internal security subcommittee. In the '60s, the 
station was criticized for the opinions of some of its announcers who opposed 
the Vietnam War. In the '70s, the Los Angeles Police Department searched the 
station after the news director aired a tape of Patricia Hearst (a.k.a. Tanya) 
declaring her loyalty to the Symbionese Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the station's license was threatened when the Federal Communications 
Commission objected to a sexually frank radio play about AIDS that was found to 
be obscene. 
</P>
<P>
More crippling have been the bickering and staff firings that were often aired 
publicly through the media. Listeners occasionally heard shouting matches and, 
more often, discussions and rebuttals to discussions on internal policy 
decisions. Some of these arguments are heard in the documentary. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very proud of being able to portray the station's internal conflicts 
without seeming to simply air dirty laundry," Program Director Lucia Chappelle 
said during a break from mixing the final version of the documentary. 
</P>
<P>
She also co-produced the original documentary history of the station 10 years 
ago, "KPFK: The First Two Decades," with Mike Hodel, who died in 1986. The new 
version will use much of the first documentary with updates of the events and 
struggles of the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's done in kind of a dreamlike fashion," Chappelle said. "'Some people 
aren't even identified, but you can glean their impact by what they say." 
</P>
<P>
One such unidentified person describes the station this way: "The air is full 
of voices these days, and full of sound and fury . . . you can hear almost 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sounds and the Fury" airs Monday at midnight on KPFK. LAURIE OCHOA

UNDERWATER ON A SOVIET MINIATURE SUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER CRONKITE, Former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite, 72, was invited 
to participate in a dive aboard a Soviet mini-sub on Tuesday. He wrote this 
account of his experience for the View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HAMILTON, Bermuda 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet Union oceanographers, in the latest manifestation of glasnost, are 
showing off their newest state-of-the-art mini-submarines to a select group of 
American scientists this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Russians seem to be sparing no secrets from the Americans and even talk 
freely and with pride of their tiny subs' part last May in locating the Soviet 
nuclear submarine that sank off Norway with the loss of 42 lives. 
</P>
<P>
They said that they got a good look at the sub where it lies more than a mile 
deep, at 6,500 feet, and that it appears intact with no leakage of 
radioactivity -- a matter of overriding concern to these scientists. 
</P>
<P>
The large, well-appointed mother ship, the Academician Alexander Mstislav 
Keldysh, is now cruising eight miles off this island while the two subs dive on 
the great extinct volcano called the Bermuda Sea Mount. 
</P>
<P>
Several years of informal talks between American and Soviet ocean scientists 
and a year of intense negotiations brought about this first joint oceanographic 
venture. The Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oceanology and a group of 
American scientists brought together by the National Geographic are the 
co-sponsors of this phase. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey co-sponsored the first stage, a dive a month ago on 
the Palmer Ridge midway between the Azores and Spain. The subs dove three miles 
below to study the geology of this 25-million-year-old escarpment, an almost 
unexplored region of the ocean depths. 
</P>
<P>
This week I was invited to participate in the first dive of a week-long series 
designed to further acquaint the Americans with the Soviet submarines, crews 
and systems and to test an American theory on how to better photograph and 
study the large sea creatures which live at extreme depths -- maybe even (this 
is always the hope of explorers) to find new beasts down there. 
</P>
<P>
The idea seems simple enough. The men who thought it up are Dr. Joe MacInnis, a 
52-year-old physician from Toronto, who has spent a lifetime diving to study 
human performance in the ocean's hostile environment, and Emory Kristof, a 
48-year-old bearded figure MacInnis calls the world's greatest underwater 
photographer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lure Giant Sharks 
</P>
<P>
They call it megabaiting and its purpose is to more efficiently lure into range 
of the submarine cameras those wily giant sharks and other predators cruising 
the Atlantic deep. By taking down more bait they hope to be able to hover for 
hours, silent and dark nearby, to get pictures of more animals over a longer 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
On my mission I dove to 3,600 feet to place the bait along the slope of the old 
volcano that rises 16,000 feet and whose 200-square-mile peak is today's 
Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
"We" were my co-observer, Wilbur Garrett, editor of the National Geographic, 
our Soviet pilot, Evgeny Chezniaev (Genya), and I. We were in Mir II -- Mir, 
the Russian word for "peace." 
</P>
<P>
There are two Mirs, designed by the Russians and built on contract by Finland. 
Launched two years ago, they joined one of the smallest fleets in the world and 
certainly the most exotic -- the mini-submarines capable of carrying two or 
three persons to almost four miles below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
There are only three others -- the French Nautile, which was used to reach the 
Titanic; a Japanese entry and the U.S. Navy's Alvin, the pioneer deep 
submersible now 25 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the twin Mirs are faster and more comfortable than their rivals. 
All are about the same size -- the cabins are roughly six by six feet square 
and five feet high, but the Mirs, thanks to newer, miniaturized equipment, have 
been able to leave more room for the occupants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confined Four Hours 
</P>
<P>
And comfort can mean efficiency when one is confined to such a tiny box for 
more than four hours on a simple dive. A 20-hour dive planned later would 
provide an ultimate test of the Mirs' comfort quotient. 
</P>
<P>
In Mir, in contrast to at least Alvin, one can stand almost fully erect to 
stretch one's cold-cramped legs. 
</P>
<P>
And another important factor is that the Mirs are built so that storage and 
equipment bins are fitted along the hull, providing some insulation between the 
crew and the cold, damp bulkhead against which one is forced on the Alvin. 
</P>
<P>
Two leather couches almost six feet long line two sides of Mir, and from a 
prone position on his stomach an observer can peer out of a six-inch wide 
porthole. The pilot from his chair, which also can be collapsed to form a couch 
for better viewing, looks out a one-foot wide porthole. 
</P>
<P>
These, the only windows, must be small and strong to withstand the 
1,800-pounds-per-square-inch pressure at 3,600 feet or 10,000 psi at maximum 
depth of 20,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Our dive went like this: 
</P>
<P>
9:45 a.m. A cloudy day, the sea comparatively calm, the white tile roofs of 
Bermuda barely visible on the horizon. We climb a ladder up the curving side of 
Mir II, resting in her cradle on the Keldysh's deck. We are dressed in jump 
suits with virtually nothing underneath. We've been warned that the heat will 
be intense until we get to some depth, an hour or an hour and a half from now, 
and then there will be thermal outer garments aboard if we need them. How wise 
this bit of information. 
</P>
<P>
We balance precariously at the edge of the hatch on top of the sub to take off 
our shoes, which we drop in a cardboard box held by one of the ship's crew. 
Then through the narrow hatch and down the four rungs of steel ladder into the 
sub. 
</P>
<P>
It is already intensely hot inside. With the humidity it seems much hotter than 
the 89 degrees the gauge shows. Perspiration actually bursts out. Genya passes 
out the towels. 
</P>
<P>
9:53 a.m. We have been swung outboard from Keldysh by a large derrick and now 
we are dropped gently into the water. The submarine, not meant to be stable in 
this unnatural surface environment, bobs like a cork. 
</P>
<P>
9:58 a.m. We are waiting for divers to attach onto Mir's maneuverable claw the 
yard-square, open-weave, wire-reinforced plastic basket holding our "megabait" 
-- 1,000 pounds of fresh tuna -- a lot of fish food and a fortune in sushi. The 
temperature is up to 95. 
</P>
<P>
10:09 a.m. The bait is affixed and the divers give us thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
10:11 a.m. We are on the way down, a free fall with the sub upright and no 
sense of motion except for occasional bits of white debris of some sort that 
give the illusion of ascending around us. 
</P>
<P>
10:13 a.m. We are descending at the rate of about 70 feet a minute. The sea has 
darkened gradually, and, now at almost 300 feet, it is almost black outside. We 
won't see the natural light again for hours. 
</P>
<P>
I notice a little pool of water on the sill of the porthole. A leak! I hope I 
don't look as alarmed as I feel as I point it out to Genya. He shrugs and 
shakes his head. I take that -- hopefully -- to mean no problem. 
</P>
<P>
10:21 a.m. Genya leans forward. He is frowning as he studies the instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything wrong?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
"Not. Not nothing," he answers. 
</P>
<P>
I am not assured. 
</P>
<P>
10:23 a.m. We are 900 feet down, a fourth of the way. The temperature is not 
dropping yet. Rivers of sweat are pouring down my back, a tickling trickle. 
Genya has dropped his jump suit to the waist. 
</P>
<P>
10:30 a.m. Genya tries to contact the surface by radio -- our only lifeline. If 
we had to summon help, the other Mir might be able to render some assistance. 
The crew cannot transfer from one sub to the other, but a second sub might be 
able to disentangle the stricken sub. 
</P>
<P>
His first couple of calls go unanswered. Perhaps it is only 10 or 15 seconds 
before he gets a response, but it seems a lot longer to this novice. 
</P>
<P>
Readouts on the communications equipment and instrument panels are all in 
English. Genya can't explain why. 
</P>
<P>
10:35 a.m. We are at 1,800 feet, one-half the way down. Temperature holding 
high. 
</P>
<P>
Genya is fiddling with the computer which reads "TOC Error." I hope it is 
minor. Could it mean: "Take Off Cronkite?" Or "Tell Off Cronkite." These 
computers are getting pretty smart, I realize. 
</P>
<P>
10:37 a.m. Instrument showed our heading 15 minutes ago as 101 degrees -- 
roughly southeast. Now it reads 127 degrees. We are slowly revolving due south, 
toward Bermuda, but this, like our descent, is unnoticeable. 
</P>
<P>
10:43 a.m. 2,500 feet. I feel some tilting, nose up, but Bill doesn't. No 
instrument that I can find shows that attitude. The temperature has dropped a 
couple of degrees but not much help. 
</P>
<P>
10:46 a.m. 2,700 feet. Action! A huge shark hits our bait box suspended out 
there on the grappler arm. The sub rocks almost imperceptibly. He hits it again 
in a quick pass, his body blocking the porthole as he darts past. And then he 
is gone. He doesn't like the wire-enmeshed plastic despite the tuna inside. 
</P>
<P>
10:52 a.m. I notice the smell of something like hydraulic fluid -- another fire 
hazard, like the explosive pure oxygen I assume we are breathing. Any short in 
the sub's electrical equipment could touch us off like a bomb, I reason. Bill 
says he smells it too. From Genya: "No problem." (I learned later that the 
atmosphere in the sub is ambient air from the surface, just touched up with a 
little oxygen. Nothing explosive about it. Now they tell me!) 
</P>
<P>
Temperature has dropped another couple of degrees -- not much but it feels more 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
11:03 a.m. 3,475 feet. We see the bottom -- or what will have to stand in for 
it. Actually there is no "bottom" here. This extinct volcano rises at an 
average of about 60 degrees and what we are seeing now is the side of a 
mountain, great outcroppings of rocks covered with what looks like snow. It is 
fine coral sand that over the centuries has piled onto these rocks to give them 
an appearance of an Alpine mountain. 
</P>
<P>
We are moving down the mountainside. There are little, almost level patches and 
suddenly it drops straight down and we are looking at the side of a rugged 
cliff. Here now the cliff actually becomes an overhang. The mountainside drops 
away underneath into the dark beyond the range of our lights, which is only a 
dozen feet or so. 
</P>
<P>
The first living thing floats by -- a twig-like being that looks like a 
seaborne giant praying mantis. There is life in the cliffside -- beautiful 
young coral, fan coral and something I have never seen before -- a coral that 
grows straight out from the cliff on a long, corkscrew stem before blossoming 
into an umbrella-shaped lacy bush. 
</P>
<P>
11:05 a.m. 3,600 feet. Our basket touches the cliff and Genya opens the grapple 
to place it on the slope. It sets off an avalanche, a snowstorm of the fine 
coral sand. We are caught in the blizzard. Visibility zero. 
</P>
<P>
11:12 a.m. We are waiting for the snowstorm to subside so Genya can see how the 
bait basket is situated. I wonder if we will see it again. It seems to me that 
it must have tumbled down this steep mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
Temperature down to 87 and time to zip up the jump suit. Genya is still 
bare-chested. 
</P>
<P>
11:20 a.m. Sand storm has subsided but no bait box in sight. Keldysh is asking 
us to start back. They want to get other dives in today. Genya asks what we 
want to do. Bill and I want to try to find the lost bait box and see if it has 
attracted any hungry sharks. 
</P>
<P>
Our color television monitor that gives a great picture of the scene 
immediately outside the sub has gone out. 
</P>
<P>
We bump the bottom, and another snowstorm. Another wait for visibility to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
11:33 a.m. Finally we find the bait box just below where we left it. A couple 
of eels and small fish are picking at it. 
</P>
<P>
The box is perched precariously on the cliff side and the scientists on Keldysh 
fear that any attacking sharks would knock it off, never to be found again. So 
Genya picks it up again with the grappling arm and we'll take it back to the 
surface. We won't be permitted to try again. The Keldysh wants us back. We have 
failed our one task on this dive. 
</P>
<P>
11:40 a.m. We are climbing the cliff face like an elevator and at about that 
speed. The temperature has dropped to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
12:07 p.m. Genya breaks out our Russian lunch from under the seat -- a 
three-layered dagwood. The first level bologna, the second cheese and the third 
various vegetables including tomato and lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
The most annoying problem now is condensation, which drips from the overhead on 
my notes and camera and inside my glasses. 
</P>
<P>
12:40 p.m. Genya lights the after-burners. Up to now we have been rising on the 
natural buoyancy from having pumped water from our ballast tanks. Now he starts 
the small maneuvering engines and tilts the nose up a bit. It gives us some 
small additional speed. We are now rising almost 60 feet a minute. 
</P>
<P>
12:56 p.m. We are 180 feet from the surface and the sea is brightening. 
</P>
<P>
1 p.m. We are bobbing again on the surface in the sea of beautiful bubbles from 
our venting tanks. 
</P>
<P>
1:30 p.m. The divers have recovered the bait box and we are being lifted toward 
the Keldysh. 
</P>
<P>
1:37 p.m. Back in our cradle. The Mir has landed and I take one giant step back 
aboard the Keldysh.

SAMPLE DAY AT THE MART: IT'S A SHOPPER'S BONANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bargain hunters who get even more of a thrill when they have to dig for the 
deals say the California Mart is a shoppers' nirvana. Even the size of the 
place suggests heavenly proportions. It's a rambling, three-wing, 13-story 
structure at 110 E. 9th St., with 2,000 showrooms and more than 10,000 
collections of clothing, shoes and accessories to paw through -- all at 
wholesale prices. 
</P>
<P>
Most days the building is only open to retailers, and the items they inspect 
are one-of-a-kind samples of next season's merchandise that will be delivered 
to their stores for fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open to the Public 
</P>
<P>
But then there is sample day, a once-a-month, wild and woolly free-for-all open 
to the public. It's a somewhat erratic event, scheduled on the last Friday of 
many, but not all, months. Today's is the last one of the summer, because there 
is no sample day in August. 
</P>
<P>
From the time the doors open at 9 a.m. until they close at 5 p.m., showroom 
owners will be selling off last season's goods. But because they work so far 
ahead, last season by their definition is this season for everybody else. 
Today's sale is filled with summer clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The bargains are impressive, especially considering that most of the 
merchandise is better quality and often carries a familiar label. And 
everything is right in style. At last month's sale, there were soft, colorful 
children's leather shoes from Australia for $5 a pair. Psychedelic-colored 
cotton T-shirts for teen-agers were $15. Textured suede purses were $60. One 
showroom offered cotton print camisoles and tap pants for $15 a set and slips 
for $8. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to find things because this isn't a messy madhouse. But there are no 
dressing rooms for trying on clothes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preview of Fall 
</P>
<P>
Summertime sales also offer a glimpse at what will be in stores after Labor 
Day, because that new merchandise now fills the showroom windows. On display 
are suede and leather suits by Vakko, the well-known New York label, which will 
be available in September. Shapely and tailored, they are shown in plum and 
crimson, among other colors. Look for plenty of animal-skin prints and 
Southwest motifs too, hinting at other trends to come. Hat lovers will get a 
preview of some ornately feathered creations by George Zamau'l in brilliant 
blue, raspberry and yellow that won't be in stores for several months. 
</P>
<P>
More than bargains and previews of future fashion looks, sample day is unusual 
for its ambiance. From the moment shoppers enter the expansive lobby crowned by 
a canopy of stained glass, they're in for a different experience. The ground 
floor could pass for a bustling business hotel. The jam-packed escalators carry 
shoppers up and down from the center of the lobby, and people watchers can 
catch the action while relaxing in deep, comfortable chairs. The snack shops 
around the lobby include bakeries, salad bars and pizzerias, but food and drink 
are priced at retail, even on sample day. 
</P>
<P>
You can spot the veteran shoppers right away. They're at the door before 9 
a.m., shopping bags in hand (because the showrooms don't supply bags), cash 
practically burning a hole in their purses. And cash is required. Checks and 
credit cards are not accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Well before noon, they are already pouring out of the elevators onto the 
building's upper levels, heading straight for their favorite showrooms and 
attacking the sale racks with gusto. One realtor from Hacienda Heights said she 
spends about $200 on clothes for herself and her two young daughters at every 
outing to the Mart. She flicked quickly through a rack of children's clothes as 
she spoke, found nothing of interest, and raced off to another showroom. 
</P>
<P>
Doris Deitering, a seasoned sample-day shopper and a physical education teacher 
from Diamond Bar, confessed: "I am hooked. I hardly ever buy anything in the 
stores anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Deitering and others with her considerable expertise know that every floor has 
its specialty. The third, for example, is for women's wear, the fourth and 
fifth are for boys and men, the sixth floor is for children's fashions. It's 
most efficient to plan your shopping tour to include what you most want to see, 
because it is virtually impossible to get to more than about two dozen 
showrooms without risking absolute exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the showrooms have samples for sale each month, but most carry a sign 
in the window telling whether there are items available that day. Where there 
are sales, the selection is wide, but the range of sizes is sharply limited. 
Most women's clothes and shoes are Size 6. Men's sizes are usually 30 to 34, 
with shoes in Size 8. The children's wear selection is broader, from infant 
sizes to Size 14, with shoe sizes from 1 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
There is just a sprinkling of other sizes. 
</P>
<P>
While plenty of shoppers adore sample day, the Mart owners and tenants say they 
approach it with some trepidation. To them, it can be a day of security 
problems, unruly crowds and a lack of understanding by shoppers about how the 
bargain day works. 
</P>
<P>
"Sample sales are a real thorn in our side," said Susan Morse-Lebow, a general 
partner and director of operations for the Mart. She said tenants have a clause 
in their leases prohibiting sales to the public, but "they all violate it." She 
said Mart management allows it because the event is a longstanding tradition. 
Occasionally, however, when the halls get too crowded or the public becomes too 
disruptive, she asks the Mart's security guards to gradually and politely clear 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen tenants interviewed agreed that sample day presents its 
problems. They find that some shoppers expect to find the same color and size 
selections they find at the local mall. Some ignore window signs stating that 
there is nothing for sale in a particular showroom and barge in where other 
business is being conducted. Other trials and tribulations the reps associate 
with the day include customers' failure to carry cash and their indignation 
upon discovering that shopping bags are not supplied. But reps said it was 
still worth the effort, because it allows them a way to clear out merchandise 
and generate cash. 
</P>
<P>
If sample day is a version of nirvana, it's an imperfect one. Yet the place 
always seems to be filled with smiling shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Mart Smarts 
</P>
<P>
If you want to try sample-day shopping, here are some tips to make it more 
pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
It costs $7.50 a day for parking underneath or across the street from the Mart. 
There are less expensive lots nearby, but metered parking won't give you enough 
time to explore. 
</P>
<P>
Do not bring children 13 or under or infants, in or out of strollers. Mart 
security guards will not let you in. 
</P>
<P>
Wear comfortable shoes. The Mart has three interconnected, 13-story buildings, 
and you will be walking for miles. 
</P>
<P>
Check the directory in the lobby of the Mart or near the elevators on each 
floor if you are looking for a specific brand. 
</P>
<P>
Observe the signs on the showroom doors. Showroom sales reps post a notice 
saying whether they have samples for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Bring only cash. The reps do not accept checks or credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Bring your own shopping bags. Showrooms do not have them. 
</P>
<P>
Don't try to bargain. The prices marked are final. 
</P>

DEAN: AT CENTER OF HUD MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN FESPERMAN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the longest time, Deborah Gore Dean wandered through life. She went to 
college and wandered for eight years, detouring to Ireland, to the drama club, 
to off-campus jobs and occasionally to class. Neither she nor her professors 
came away dazzled. 
</P>
<P>
She drifted through political campaigns, stumping first for her aunt, Louise 
Gore, in legislative and gubernatorial races in Maryland, then stepping aboard 
Ronald Reagan's presidential juggernaut in 1980. But she voted for no one, 
because she never registered until the summer before her 27th birthday, in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, she made her way to a job at the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, and Deborah Dean stopped wandering. In a way, she was back where 
she had begun, reborn into power and money. 
</P>
<P>
As executive assistant to agency secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., Dean took 
control, her colleagues say, and Pierce usually seemed willing to go along for 
the ride. 
</P>
<P>
But a funny thing happened. HUD itself began to wander, drifting from its 
mission of housing the poor into forays of political favoritism, waste and 
fraud. And now, as Congress and auditors try to make sense of the agency's 
misguided mess of about $2 billion in losses, many point to the 34-year-old 
Dean as a symbol of the inexperience and caprice that led HUD astray. 
</P>
<P>
Agency documents and correspondence support that assessment. Widely varying 
portraits of Dean emerged in interviews with more than 40 of her friends, 
family members and co-workers. But even the most divergent views shared common 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Portrait 
</P>
<P>
To many of her HUD colleagues, of whom more than 24 were interviewed, she 
became a manipulative, temperamental despot who demanded obedience and inspired 
fear. Those who were loyal were promoted. Those who bucked the system found 
their careers at a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
To her family and friends, she is warm, devoted and willing to go the extra 
mile, whether that means daily hospital visits to her mother, who is struggling 
through chemotherapy, or pulling together family celebrations of Thanksgiving 
and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
But both schools of thought hold that Dean has an assertive, take-charge 
attitude, an outgoing personality, a flair for the theatrical gesture, yet also 
a tendency to be insecure and naive. 
</P>
<P>
Dean is not talking to reporters these days. When she appeared last month 
before Congress, she took the Fifth Amendment, and she refers media inquiries 
to her lawyer, former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova. 
</P>
<P>
Her life has been out of the ordinary almost from the beginning. She was born 
in New York City, but in 1958 when she was 3, her father, Gordon, once head of 
the Atomic Energy Commission, was killed in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Mary Gore Dean, then moved the family to the Gore family estate in 
the Washington suburb of Marwood, Md. It was quite a place to grow up -- a 
red-roofed, 33-room mansion set on 200 acres of pastures and woodland 
overlooking a wide, sweeping bend on the Potomac River. It made a cameo 
appearance in the film "Broadcast News," masquerading as the Italian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politics in the Family 
</P>
<P>
At Marwood, politics were passed round the dinner table with the meat and 
potatoes. Aunt Louise, who never married, served in the Maryland Legislature 
and was the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1974, defeated by Marvin 
Mandel. Two of her uncles were senators, Thomas Pryor Gore of Oklahoma and 
Albert Gore of the family's Democratic wing in Tennessee (his son, Albert Gore 
Jr., is now a senator). 
</P>
<P>
When life got boring, there was always the spacious family townhouse in 
Georgetown, or the set of family apartments at the Gores' Fairfax Hotel (later 
sold and renamed the Ritz-Carlton), or perhaps a meal at the Gores' snappy 
restaurant, the Jockey Club. 
</P>
<P>
Dean's mother made a point of not spoiling her children, Louise Gore said, yet 
no one pressured Dean as she moved through Georgetown University at a leisurely 
pace. She spent eight years before graduating, barely, 507th in a class of 509, 
said Bart Naylor, who in 1987 did a background check on her for the Senate 
Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
She then turned her attention to a small local magazine, City Life, that she 
and a friend put together a year earlier. She gave that up a few months later 
to work briefly for a public relations firm, then phoned home one day in 1981 
to announce she joined the federal government. On a tip from a friend, she 
landed a job as a public relations assistant in the Department of Energy. That 
is also when she registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
After little more than a year, she moved over to HUD, becoming a special 
assistant to the secretary, which mostly involved keeping mail flowing smoothly 
through the office. Her work caught the attention of Pierce, and 18 months 
later she made the move that many people now say she was not ready for, up to 
the job as Pierce's executive assistant. Some of her friends suggested her 
ascent was eased by her connection to the late John Mitchell, attorney general 
in the Nixon Administration, who then lived with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Trifle Insecure 
</P>
<P>
In those days, her charm and wit made her well-liked, HUD officials say. Many 
thought she was a trifle insecure, but at first that showed up only in small 
ways, such as when she bought extravagant gifts for friends and co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
She stayed busy, working long hours and viewing HUD's programs idealistically. 
"I honestly think that when she first took the job her motivations were pure," 
a former senior HUD official said. "But over the years those motivations 
eroded." 
</P>
<P>
Her boss, meanwhile, was gone for long stretches. A former Pierce assistant 
whose office was across the hall recalled that she met the secretary one-on-one 
only once during her first three months, and that was at a photo session. 
</P>
<P>
Into that vacuum of power moved Dean. "It was subtle," one senior official 
said. "She just slowly realized she could get away with more and more." So, 
when people came looking for the secretary to cut red tape, Dean did the job 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a pleasure to deal with," recalled a Philadelphia developer, John B. 
Rosenthal, who needed HUD rental subsidies to help convert an old hotel into 64 
apartments for the elderly. "The people (at HUD) told us that she was really 
the key decision maker on those programs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ultimate Weapon' 
</P>
<P>
Dean's co-workers said her growing authority had the secretary's tacit consent, 
but that her "ultimate weapon" was his signature, which she commanded with an 
autopen device that scrawled "Samuel R. Pierce Jr." at the push of a button. 
</P>
<P>
So, Dean's bursts of extravagance progressed, HUD officials said, and her 
favors now came from HUD's large pocketbook of grants and subsidies, 
particularly the moderate rehabilitation program, known as Mod Rehab, that 
encouraged developers to spruce up dilapidated housing for low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Such grants were supposed to be awarded to local housing authorities, which 
sorted out the best proposals. But HUD documents show that Dean helped turn the 
process upside down, with approval coming straight from the top. Soon, the word 
was out among well-connected Republicans: If you want HUD money, see Dean. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that because of her insecurity there was almost a feeding frenzy with 
these consultants and developers," a former HUD administrator said. "I think 
they knew that if you took her to dinner once, twice, or took her to an 
important function, that Debbie would do anything for you. I think Debbie 
thought these people were truly friends . . . but you learn in this business 
that if you give out money people are only in it for their own interests, and 
the minute you lose your signing authority, hasta la bye-bye." 
</P>
<P>
Though other officials joined in, some senior staff members at HUD did not 
think this was a great way to run things, and they said so, according to senior 
HUD officials. Dean turned on them. "People seemed to think she had a hit 
list," Naylor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Invincible 
</P>
<P>
Dean proved to be invincible on most personnel decisions, officials said, and 
the results were often brutal. Among the examples cited by more than a dozen 
HUD employees: She had an employee's office furniture moved out while he was 
away, she had employees stripped of authority or moved to dead-end positions 
and she held up promotions. 
</P>
<P>
Emblematic of the cavalier treatment was her release of a confidential HUD memo 
in 1986 to an official of the Teamsters Union. The union failed to get some HUD 
grants, and one reason was a rejection by Robert Wilden, director of a HUD 
housing division. Dean gave union housing official John J. Joyce a copy of 
Wilden's critique of the Teamster proposals, and Joyce reacted by saying there 
was a "cancer" at HUD that needed to be "cut out." 
</P>
<P>
Wilden was shaken by the threat, according to a HUD investigation of the 
matter, though Dean told an investigator she did not take the remark seriously 
and laughingly replied to Joyce, "What are you going to do, put him (Wilden) in 
cement shoes?" 
</P>
<P>
Some employees became so fearful of possible retaliation by Dean that they felt 
obligated to obey without question when she asked them to help clean her 
apartment during work hours or run other errands. She borrowed one employee's 
charge card to buy a dress, then "repaid" the employee a few months later by 
dropping off the dress at the employee's desk, former administrators said. The 
employee let the matter drop. 
</P>
<P>
But as Dean solidified her control at HUD, her control in other areas slipped. 
Frequently she spent late nights out, according to employees who socialized 
with her, and they say she often showed up for work at 10:30 or 11 a.m., 
complaining of a hangover. Dean, through her spokesman, denied that. 
</P>
<P>
Her personal finances were a mess, Naylor said. She qualified for a credit card 
only by applying through HUD for a Diner's Club account. Though she signed an 
agreement not to use the card for personal expenses, she did anyway, and by 
late 1987 ran up a balance of $5,390, with $1,765 in overdue payments. When HUD 
cautioned her about the card, she said she had not read the fine print, but she 
used the card twice more for personal charges, one a payment of $206 at 
Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Workaholic' 
</P>
<P>
Friends and family members apparently did not notice any signs of trouble. Gore 
said her biggest concern then was that her niece had become "a workaholic." 
</P>
<P>
They also said Dean talked little of her work except about the agency's push 
for Fair Housing legislation, one of the few efforts for which Pierce has 
received praise. Dean organized a nationwide promotional tour for Pierce on the 
subject, but even that was tainted by disclosures that she had financed much of 
the trip with $2 million from businesses, many of which dealt with HUD. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the public began to find out about the way things were running at 
HUD. Some hints emerged in late 1987, when Dean was nominated to become HUD's 
deputy secretary, a title that would have made her the agency's official No. 2 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Dean testified at her confirmation hearing in August, 1987, "I have never given 
or approved or pushed or coerced anyone to help any developer." Nonetheless, 
the Senate held up her nomination for months, and was preparing to subpoena 
witnesses to see whether she committed perjury, Naylor said, when the White 
House withdrew her name. 
</P>
<P>
By then she had left HUD but was keeping in touch through her new business as a 
consultant. HUD officials said she used her contacts in the agency to help 
boost her early business. 
</P>
<P>
When the HUD inspector general and a congressional inquiry began prying into 
the HUD mess last spring, Dean soon achieved notoriety, and joining the chorus 
against her was Pierce, who told reporters after testifying before Congress, 
"She liked power. She liked the idea, 'I can call the shots, I can get this for 
you if I want, I can stomp on you, I can kill you.' " 
</P>
<P>
That prompted Dean's younger brother, Gordon, to say of Pierce, "He has, as 
Mark Twain put it, shown all the qualities of a dog, except loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
Family and friends say Dean has become a scapegoat. "It's the barracuda theory 
at work," said friend Michael Bayer, who was her boss at the Department of 
Energy, and now lobbies for a natural gas pipe company. "In Washington, if it 
bleeds, hit it. A lot of people are real anxious for one person to be 
responsible for what went on over there." 
</P>
<P>
Though Dean is silent for now, she may yet testify before Congress if she can 
get some immunity against prosecution. She has hinted she would pin her actions 
on Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, she is once again adrift, staying busy by supervising an overhaul of 
the family's Georgetown townhouse, consulting with her attorney and doing a bit 
of consulting, though her spokesman would not say what kind.

CANCER TRIGGER MECHANISM OF CHOLESTEROL IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time, researchers have identified a biochemical mechanism by 
which high cholesterol levels can help trigger colorectal and pancreatic 
cancers, two of the five most deadly tumors among U.S. cancer victims. 
</P>
<P>
Epidemiological studies had previously linked diets high in meat and other 
fatty foods, as well as high cholesterol levels, to colorectal cancer, but 
researchers had virtually no idea what role cholesterol played in tumor 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a UC Berkeley group has found that a chemical crucial to the formation of 
cholesterol is necessary for the functioning of a gene that triggers tumor 
formation in the pancreas, colon and rectum. Their research, reported in 
today's issue of the journal Science, suggests that diet and the use of drugs 
that interfere with cholesterol metabolism might be used to prevent and perhaps 
even treat certain forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Their research also provides a strong rationale for current efforts to prevent 
colorectal cancer by eating foods low in fat and high in fiber that reduce 
cholesterol levels. Oncologist Robert Mayer of the Harvard Medical School 
called the study "an elegant observation . . . that may provide the first step 
in linking epidemiological evidence to cancer mechanisms." 
</P>
<P>
Colorectal cancer is second only to lung cancer as a cause of death. Of the 
151,000 Americans who contract colorectal cancer each year, 62,000 die. 
Pancreatic cancer is fifth in number of deaths, and has an extremely high 
mortality rate, accounting for 25,000 deaths among 27,000 cases annually. 
</P>
<P>
Colorectal cancer occurs much more commonly in industrialized countries that 
have a diet rich in meats and other fatty materials than it does in developing 
countries whose inhabitants have only a subsistence diet. 
</P>
<P>
Two 1985 studies, one from Sweden and one from West Germany, also associated a 
high incidence of colorectal cancer with high levels of cholesterol in the 
bloodstream. One study showed, for example, that individuals with cholesterol 
levels in the highest 20% were more than twice as likely to develop tumors as 
those in the lowest 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have had a difficult time explaining the biochemical mechanisms 
involved in these findings. Currently, the most widely accepted theory is that 
high levels of fat in the colon increase the percentage of organisms there that 
might produce carcinogens. This theory, Mayer noted, has been particularly 
difficult to prove. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smoking Link 
</P>
<P>
Pancreatic cancer, in contrast, has not been strongly associated with diet. The 
only well-known risk factor for it is smoking. 
</P>
<P>
But the two types of cancer share one trait: at least 50% of pancreatic tumors 
and 90% of colorectal tumors are thought to be triggered, at least in part, by 
the ras oncogene. Oncogenes are genes normally found in cells that, when 
activated under certain conditions, trigger unrestrained proliferation of cells 
-- in other words, a tumor. 
</P>
<P>
Although researchers do not yet know how the ras oncogene operates, they do 
know one crucial fact: The protein produced from it, called the RAS protein, 
must be bound to the cell's membrane before it can signal the cell to begin 
dividing and developing into a tumor. 
</P>
<P>
Geneticists Jasper Rine and William Schafer of UC Berkeley discovered that, in 
yeast, the RAS protein is bound to the membrane by a molecule that is converted 
into cholesterol. If the molecule, called farnesyl pyrophosphate, is not 
present in the yeast, the RAS protein cannot bind to the yeast cell membrane 
and stimulate cellular proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
Because the yeast ras oncogene is very similar to its human counterpart, the 
Berkeley scientists began collaborating with chemist Sung-Hou Kim and his 
colleagues at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory to study the human gene. 
</P>
<P>
In their key experiment, they injected the human RAS protein into frog eggs and 
found that it stimulated the eggs to divide. But when they simultaneously 
injected a drug called lovastatin, which is used to reduce cholesterol levels 
in humans by blocking its synthesis, they found that the RAS protein had no 
effect on the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, Kim said, "Drugs that block cholesterol synthesis block RAS protein 
activity" and thus should block cancer cells from proliferating. 
</P>
<P>
Much more speculative is the possibility that cholesterol-blocking drugs or 
foods could kill existing tumors. But Kim suggests that because every cell in a 
tumor has to have the RAS protein anchored to the membrane, interfering with 
cholesterol synthesis could halt, or even reverse, this process and shrink the 
tumor. 
</P>
<P>
"Our finding opens new avenues for investigating these cancers and potentially 
for treating them with cholesterol-reducing drugs, which are safer than current 
therapies," which have many potent side-effects, Rine said. Kim noted that the 
group plans to begin studying this in mice in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Normal levels of cholesterol are necessary to the cell, which uses it in 
building membranes. Apparently only the excess cholesterol is used for 
anchoring the RAS protein, contributing to the formation of tumors. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Kim pointed out, one could conceivably allow the farnesyl pyrophosphate 
level to be high enough for the cell's healthy needs but low enough to rob the 
RAS proteins of their necessary anchor.

SOVIET BALTIC REPUBLICS GAIN TWIN VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union's restive Baltic republics won both practical and symbolic 
victories Thursday in their campaign for greater independence from the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
The practical victory came as the country's revitalized Parliament adopted two 
resolutions paving the way for Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to gain a degree 
of economic autonomy that the Soviet leadership had decried as unacceptable as 
recently as last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The symbolic advance was the report by a member of a state commission assessing 
the 1939 Soviet-German nonaggression pact, who told Radio Moscow that the panel 
has determined secret protocols attached to the treaty to be illegal and that 
they "should be proclaimed non-operative." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backdrop for Seizure 
</P>
<P>
The protocols, long recognized in the West but denied here, designated the 
then-independent Baltic nations as within the Kremlin's sphere of influence, 
and they formed the backdrop against which the Soviet Union absorbed Lithuania, 
Latvia and Estonia as constituent republics in 1940. The commission's 
conclusion thus supports the argument that the Baltic states were illegally 
stripped of their sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Both developments occur at a time of increasing unrest in the three Baltic 
republics, where next month's 50th anniversary of the so-called 
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is expected to trigger mass demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
During a heated debate in the Supreme Soviet on Baltic economic autonomy, 
Estonian deputy Mikhail Bronstein had warned that should the lawmakers try to 
postpone consideration of the issue, "the mandate of faith, given to deputies 
by the peoples of Baltic republics, will pass on" to others. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are generally considered to be the wealthiest and 
most Western of all 15 constituent Soviet republics, and their leaders have 
been in the forefront of those pressing for more radical reforms under 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of perestroika, or restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
By moving to give the Baltics greater autonomy, Parliament made a decision of 
"historical significance," said deputy Fyodor Burlatsky, a political writer and 
leading advocate of reform considered close to Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of a movement in the direction toward real radical 
structure reform," Burlatsky added. "It is a turning point in the consciousness 
of the deputies, which, I am convinced will be a precedent for a deeper, more 
serious approach to future reform." 
</P>
<P>
One of the Supreme Soviet resolutions endorses the right of the three Baltic 
republics to install their own cost accounting systems as of January. The other 
endorses, in principle, plans adopted by the Lithuanian and Estonian 
parliaments for virtually full economic independence. Local and republican 
authorities, rather than officials in Moscow, would decide what to produce and 
how profits would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, for example, which now controls only about 11% of its industrial 
production, expects to be operating about 70% by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Latvian Parliament is considering a similar economic independence bill. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania and Estonia had originally wanted the Supreme Soviet to pass a law 
sanctioning their economic plans, but that action was deferred until after Oct. 
1. The resolutions were a compromise, but one that Baltic officials said was 
satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
"They have given us the green light for development of economic independence," 
Estonian Premier Indrek Toome told the news agency Reuters after Thursday's 
vote. "The lack of a law will in no way hinder us. We will push on." 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomatic source who has been following the situation said in an 
interview that the resolutions amount to approval for a "very substantial 
decentralization of economic authority to the republics -- one which only three 
or four months ago the center was saying was quite unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and leading reform-minded economists here have lately been pushing 
for more radical measures to break down bureaucratic resistance to reform. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Deputy Premier Minister Leonid I. Abalkin told the Supreme Soviet during 
the debate dhat autonomy should be introduced in the Baltic republics as an 
initial step toward putting the entire country on a system of decentralized 
economic management. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foundation Before Roof 
</P>
<P>
"You have to build the pyramid from below; the foundation must come before the 
roof," he said. "We must not fall behind the deadline of the beginning of next 
year for Lithuania and Estonia." 
</P>
<P>
Greater local control over economic decision making was also a key demand of 
striking coal miners who triggered what Gorbachev described as "perhaps the 
gravest test" of his four years in power two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Baltic experiment argued that it "damaged the rights of other 
republics." First Deputy Premier Yuri D. Maslyukov said he opposed "hasty 
decisions dictated by considerations of political tactics rather than the real 
economic situation." 
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov's reference to "political tactics" was seen as a veiled reference to 
Baltic sensitivities over the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, signed Aug. 23, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev agreed under pressure from the Baltics to establish a high-level 
commission to assess the pact. Earlier this week, Valentin M. Falin, head of 
the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee, 
said on a West German television interview that there is no longer any doubt 
that the pact contained the controversial, secret protocols. The originals of 
the protocols have never been found, but Soviet historians have inspected a 
microfilm copy in the West German archives. 
</P>
<P>
However, Thursday's report by Radio Moscow was believed to be the first in 
which an official was quoted as suggesting that the protocols might be 
renounced. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that the group was concluding its work, the radio quoted commission 
member Maryu Lauristin as commenting that "comprehensive studies of an 
impressive volume of documents have shown the pact was a graphic incidence of 
violation of the Leninist principles of Soviet foreign policy. Besides, the 
commission has concluded that there are secret protocols to the pact which 
should be proclaimed non-operative because they run counter to the law."

UAW REJECTED AT NISSAN PLANT IN MAJOR DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The labor movement's prospects for organizing the rapidly expanding Japanese 
manufacturing presence in industrial America suffered a major setback Thursday 
when workers at a Nissan plant here overwhelmingly rejected United Auto Workers 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the nation's most closely watched union organizing campaigns, Nissan 
workers voted 1,622 to 711 against joining the Detroit-based union. Nearly 
2,400 production workers were eligible to vote in the federally supervised 
election, which had been expected to be close. 
</P>
<P>
In an early morning press conference, relieved Nissan executives hailed the 
results and vowed to reunite the work force in the wake of the tense and 
divisive election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Election 'Disruptive' 
</P>
<P>
"We're glad this election is over . . . it's been somewhat disruptive," said 
Jerry Benefield, president of Nissan's U.S. manufacturing operations. 
</P>
<P>
UAW officers, visibly upset by the results, refused to talk with reporters 
early Thursday. Instead, the union vowed in a statement that it will continue 
trying to organize Nissan for "as long as it takes" to win. 
</P>
<P>
But Benefield added that the election results had left him "more convinced than 
ever before that the UAW will never organize Nissan." 
</P>
<P>
The UAW's loss here means that the union still has not won a contested 
organizing election at any of the new American assembly plants of the Japanese 
auto makers, which are now perhaps the most visible Japanese manufacturing 
operations in this country. The union abandoned a 1985 organizing drive at 
Honda's Ohio plant before a vote was taken. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW does represent workers at three Japanese-managed assembly plants, but 
the Japanese firms have a unionized domestic auto maker as a partner in each of 
those plants. Those affiliations allowed the UAW to use its leverage with the 
American Big Three to win representation of workers at the plants without a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the union has so far been unable to gain a foothold at the U.S. plants 
owned and operated by Japan's Big Three -- Honda in Ohio, Toyota in Kentucky 
and Nissan here. In addition, a non-union joint venture between Subaru and 
Isuzu will be opened in Indiana this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts agreed Thursday that the surprisingly large margin of victory 
represented a significant defeat for the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Convincing Victory' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's clearly a serious blow," said Harley Shaiken, a labor specialist 
at the University of California at San Diego. "This doesn't finish the UAW at 
Nissan, but it was a pretty convincing victory for the company, and it will 
make the union's job tougher at Honda, Toyota and Subaru-Isuzu," he added. "It 
is also likely to stiffen the resolve against the UAW of many of the Japanese 
auto parts suppliers opening plants here." 
</P>
<P>
The voting, which continued from Wednesday morning until early Thursday morning 
to accommodate workers on the plant's midnight shift, followed weeks of 
aggressive campaigning by both the Japanese auto maker and the million-member 
union. The two sides had put their reputations on the line in the campaign, and 
the work force had become deeply split. 
</P>
<P>
As the high-stakes election began to take on international significance in 
recent weeks, the work force came under heavy media scrutiny; Japanese 
reporters and television crews packed Thursday morning's press conference in 
Smyrna. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Organizing Drive 
</P>
<P>
The UAW has been vowing to organize Nissan since the plant opened here in 1983, 
but only this spring did it gain enough worker support to push for a vote. In 
May, the UAW petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an election 
at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Many workers switched to the UAW side in recent months because of what they 
charged has been a mounting injury rate caused by speedups on the assembly line 
and increasing job loads. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-union workers complained that Nissan's Japanese-style "team concept" labor 
policies had been abused by Nissan's American managers in a push for greater 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
The union's charges about a high Nissan injury rate seemed to have been aided 
in the last few weeks when Nissan was cited by the state of Tennessee for 
failing to publicly release injury data. 
</P>
<P>
Both the company and union had mounted intense, last-minute drives to sway 
undecided workers. The UAW brought in 30 organizers to Smyrna and aired 
pro-union radio and television commercials. The company announced a major 
expansion of the Smyrna complex, and, in the final days of the campaign, 
managers met repeatedly with small groups of workers. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the union apparently had not convinced a majority that it could 
offer any more benefits than management. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, wages and benefits were not a central issue in the election, because 
workers' pay here already approaches that of union workers at the Big Three. 
Nissan workers even have a few benefits -- a leased car program and a 401-K 
retirement plan, for example -- not available to production workers in the 
domestic industry. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the union was forced to concentrate on the injury and speedup 
issues, which were not enough to sway many workers who had not been injured. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be injuries in heavy industry wherever you go," Danny 
Smythia, an anti-union worker, said after the election results were released. 
"The problem isn't any worse here than anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-union workers agreed with Nissan's Benefield that the vote will allow the 
company to maintain the "team concept" approach to labor relations that it 
contends it needs to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need two teams in the company," Sheikh Faye, a production worker, 
said. "Now, we can unite in one team again to build the highest quality cars in 
America." 
</P>

CONFEREES AGREE TO $166-BILLION BAILOUT OF S&amp;LS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Congressional negotiators reached agreement Thursday on an unprecedented 
$166-billion cleanup of America's savings and loan industry, clearing a final 
roadblock by deciding to add almost $50 billion in upfront costs to federal 
budget deficits over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to close or merge hundreds of insolvent S&amp;Ls, however, faces 
a potential impasse in the Senate, where a substantial group of lawmakers has 
warned that it would block the bill if it contained the on-budget financing 
plan opposed by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
It was also unclear whether the Bush Administration, which made the costly 
S&amp;L bailout one of its top legislative priorities, would follow through on 
its threat to veto the legislation over the controversial financing scheme that 
requires a special exemption from the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration, which favors keeping the initial cash outlays off-budget by 
recording the interest charges over many years, fears that ignoring the 
Gramm-Rudman deficit ceilings would encourage lawmakers to abandon fiscal 
discipline in the future. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what decision is reached on the financing plan, the S&amp;L cleanup 
marks a major turning point in the crazy-quilt system that encouraged the 
creation of thousands of separate financial institutions governed by both state 
and federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the legislation could spell the end of a separate thrift industry 
devoted largely to financing home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Under the complex S&amp;L legislation, the government would spend about $50 
billion over the next three years to shut down failed institutions and put 
thrift regulators under the supervision of the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
The $50 billion would be raised by selling 30-year Treasury bonds. The ultimate 
cost could reach as high as $300 billion, including interest payments over the 
30 years, with taxpayers being required to pay about three-fourths of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The White House estimates that the clean-up will require $166 billion in 
spending over the next 10 years, with depositors in banks and S&amp;Ls paying 
part of the cost through higher insurance fees. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, which proposed the legislation six months ago, has 
pushed hard for its tougher S&amp;L accounting standards and a host of 
regulatory changes designed to prevent another massive failure in the thrift 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The bailout is necessary because industry deregulation, wild interest rate 
swings and insider fraud have led to the failure of hundreds of savings and 
loans, bankrupting the federal government's deposit insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the conference committee has finished work on the S&amp;L 
legislation, which is generally an excellent product," Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady said. "However . . . we continue to actively oppose the House 
financing plan, which requires a Gramm-Rudman waiver." 
</P>
<P>
But any further delay in approving the legislation would add roughly $1 billion 
a month to the cost of the plan as losses at insolvent savings and loans 
continue to mount, so the Administration may decide to swallow its objections 
to begin paying off depositors and end the flow of red ink. 
</P>
<P>
After decades of coddling savings and loans, many of which developed close ties 
to key politicians through campaign contributions and favors, Congress is on 
the verge of imposing a number of tough new rules expected to cause a major 
industry shakeout over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez 
(D-Tex.) and Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman 
Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) -- although new to their posts this year -- 
surprised observers by taking control of the bargaining to prevent industry 
lobbying from weakening the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The bill establishes a new agency known as the Resolution Trust Corp. to manage 
billions of dollars in assets owned by failed thrifts. The RTC plans to dispose 
of the assets, mostly empty office buildings, condominiums and raw land, over 
the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Civil Penalties 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also increases civil penalties for S&amp;L or bank fraud and 
directs thrifts to devote more attention to financing of home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
The bill requires S&amp;Ls to maintain at least 3% of their assets as capital 
available to protect depositors against losses, prohibits thrift owners from 
investing insured depositors' funds in high-risk junk bonds and sets aside 
funds to help pay for low- and moderate-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
The new restrictions on junk bonds, which will hit particularly hard at a 
handful of California S&amp;Ls, would give thrifts five years to get rid of the 
junk bonds they now hold. 
</P>
<P>
While the bill appears to push thrifts back toward their traditional role as 
home lenders, one provision would allow banks to begin buying healthy S&amp;Ls 
and merge them with their own operations. That measure, analysts said, could 
ultimately end the distinction between banks and thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the real sleeper in the bill," said Robert Litan, a banking specialist 
at the Brookings Institution. "Fundamental economic forces are breaking down 
the barriers between banks and S&amp;Ls. What you will see is a massive 
shakeout in the thrift industry." 
</P>
<P>
The last big issue to be resolved Thursday was whether to keep the cost of the 
bailout off the federal budget, as Bush and the Senate had sought, or to leave 
it on the budget and waive Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction requirements as 
proposed by the House. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the on-budget approach argued that it would reduce by $4.5 
billion to $40 billion the cost of issuing bonds to finance the bailout. 
Because the Treasury would issue the bonds, they would carry a slightly lower 
interest rate. Under the plan favored by the Senate and the Administration, the 
bonds would have been issued by a quasi-governmental agency, which would have 
had to pay slightly higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the danger of delaying the S&amp;L cleanup, White House Budget Director 
Richard G. Darman attacked the on-budget financing plan as "an all-time phony" 
because it ignored the Gramm-Rudman ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can do it for this, you can do it for anything," Darman warned. "What 
they are doing," he complained, is "essentially . . . repealing Gramm-Rudman." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Deadlock 
</P>
<P>
The House-Senate deadlock on the funding issue dragged on through five hours. 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) broke the logjam by throwing in the towel on the 
Senate position. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, we would be facing an everlasting impasse in this conference," a 
weary Cranston said. "I am still not sure what will happen in the Senate or in 
the White House." 
</P>
<P>
Two Republican negotiators, Sens. Jake Garn of Utah and John Heinz of 
Pennsylvania, warned that Thursday's action might end up simply moving the 
deadlock to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
While House negotiators won most of the difficult battles, they acceded to the 
Senate by agreeing to let M. Danny Wall, current head of the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board, keep his job without requiring that he be reconfirmed by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Some House members accused Wall, a former top aide to Garn, of hiding the size 
of the S&amp;L crisis from Congress and wanted him to face another confirmation 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
At confirmation hearings, Wall would have been certain to face questions about 
his role in delaying regulatory action against Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
of Irvine, Calif., which has been seized by regulators and will likely require 
millions of dollars in government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Such questions would be uncomfortable for Cranston and Riegle as well because 
they accepted campaign contributions from Lincoln owner Charles Keating and 
later intervened with regulators on Lincoln's behalf. Riegle has since returned 
Keating's contribution but Cranston has not. 
</P>
<P>
The bailout bill would move the regulatory functions from the independent FHLBB 
to the new Office of Thrift Supervision within the Treasury Department, which 
Wall would lead.

DRIVE PLANNED TO SPUR RATE ROLLBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the Proposition 103 campaign, Harvey Rosenfield, announced 
Thursday that his Voter Revolt organization is launching a statewide drive to 
put pressure on Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie to order immediate rate 
rollbacks as called for in the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield accused Gillespie of "refusing to act" to dismiss what he termed 
"bogus" insurance company filings for exemptions from the rollbacks. He said 
that 1.2 million Californians would be canvassed in the next few weeks and 
asked to send Gillespie personal petitions demanding that she order the 
rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the commissioner responded angrily: 
</P>
<P>
"We are the insurance regulators. We are the professionals in this field. We 
are on the job for consumers. We are busy implementing a new regulatory system 
in California. And, quite frankly, we are tired of incessant, inaccurate and 
insulting criticism from back-seat drivers who have never been road-tested in 
regulation." 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman, Carey Fletcher, said that "the Department of Insurance has 
acted swiftly to implement Proposition 103 in a manner that best serves 
California policyholders. As outlined by the commissioner in June, final 
administrative decisions on the rollback issue and all cases filed by June 3 
will be wrapped up before Nov. 8 when the prior rate approval system becomes 
effective in the state. We are on target." 
</P>
<P>
At a May 11 news conference, Gillespie, outlining her schedule, had promised to 
make all decisions on rollbacks by Nov. 8 and that the first rulings on 
individual companies would come by late July. As of Thursday, no decisions have 
been announced. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield's sharp criticism Thursday of the pace of Gillespie's work followed 
by one day new demands on Gillespie for a stronger position against the 
insurance companies from a coalition of leading consumer and public-interest 
organizations. And just a week ago, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp came out 
with some suggestions of his own in this line. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has dismissed the suggestions with increasingly sharp words. And it 
appears that a political confrontation is shaping up on Proposition 103 
enforcement that will pit the Republican commissioner, a prospective candidate 
for the post next year, against a group of primarily Democratic critics. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher charged Thursday that there is another purpose behind Rosenfield's 
announced canvass and a $500,000 "emergency" fund-raising effort to boost the 
drive for "rollbacks now." She said the hidden agenda is to support the 
prospective candidacy for commissioner of Democrat Conway Collis, a member of 
the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
Collis, for his part, joined Rosenfield at his news conference and accused 
Gillespie of "nine months of inaction" on implementing Proposition 103 "that is 
a slap in the face of every California voter." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a group of organizations -- including Voter Revolt, Consumers 
Union, California Common Cause, the Insurance Consumer Action Network and the 
Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP -- called on Gillespie to require the 
companies to provide extensive new information on how they set their rates in 
advance of hearings she has called on auto insurance pricing for mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
In these hearings, as in those held in June, Gillespie will be seeking 
recommendations on how to implement parts of Proposition 103 requiring that a 
driver's safety record, the number of miles driven and the years of driving 
experience be the paramount factors in setting rates, rather than the 
neighborhood-based pricing that now prevails. 
</P>
<P>
The groups told Gillespie in a letter that unless she forces the companies to 
provide precise rating information, "it is unlikely that these (August) 
hearings will be any more productive than those held in June . . . (when) most 
insurers presented a series of arguments attempting to justify a 'business as 
usual' approach to rating."

BAR WON'T ACT AGAINST BROWN IN WRIGHT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Bar has decided to take no action against Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown for contacting a judge who was hearing traffic charges against the 
daughter of Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
There was "an absence of compelling evidence" that Brown, a Democrat from San 
Francisco, violated its rules, the Bar said in a terse news release. 
</P>
<P>
"Speaker Brown and the judge did speak," Michael Saleen, the Bar's assistant 
chief trial counsel, said Thursday. "However, our analysis disclosed that in 
the very short conversation that ensued there was no evidence there was a 
violation." 
</P>
<P>
The Bar's 4 1/2-month investigation was prompted by a report in The Times in 
March that Brown, who is an attorney, had sought leniency with Municipal Judge 
Herbert Curtis III of Ventura County for Victoria Wright, the assemblywoman's 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter, who has been cited for traffic violations 28 times since 1981, 
was in danger of going to jail or losing her license. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor's Allegation 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury subsequently asserted that Brown 
telephoned Curtis shortly before he was to hear a misdemeanor charge against 
Victoria Wright for driving without a license and told the judge "that he did 
not believe Victoria deserved to go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
The allegation was part of Bradbury's 97-page report on Wright's alleged 
efforts to use her political clout to keep her daughter from losing her license 
or going to jail for 28 traffic violations since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney, who did not seek charges against Wright or Brown, 
referred Brown's alleged contact with Curtis to the Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Bar's Rules of Professional Conduct generally prohibit members from 
contacting judges on a pending matter without the opposing attorney present. 
Brown was not representing Victoria Wright, but was still bound by this rule, 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bar can privately or publicly admonish, censure, suspend or disbar an 
attorney for misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Brown initially denied that he contacted Curtis but later said he "could very 
well have spoken" to Curtis, "but I have no recollection of calling him for any 
purpose." In any case, he said, "Even if I had, it wouldn't be improper." 
</P>
<P>
Saleen said that both Curtis and Brown's attorney confirmed that the 
conversation occurred, but he refused to disclose what was said. Saleen said 
that the Bar's inquiry determined that Brown initially called Curtis' clerk to 
ask about the status of Victoria Wright's case. The clerk then connected him to 
Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
The decision not to charge Brown with a violation of the rules was based on a 
lack of evidence that the Speaker sought to intercede for Victoria Wright as 
well as uncertainty that the rule about contacting judges applied to him in 
this case, since he was not representing the lawmaker's daughter, Saleen said. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the Bar's announcement, Brown's press secretary, Susan Jetton, 
said: "We're glad it's over with. This is what we expected because the Speaker 
said from the beginning he hadn't done anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury responded with angry words for the Bar. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be a case of 'Don't bite the hand that feeds you,' " he said. "They 
are directly dependent upon the Legislature and the good will of the 
Legislature. Mr. Brown is a very powerful individual and pulls a lot of strings 
in this state." 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature sets the rates the Bar can charge its members for dues. The Bar 
also sponsors laws on behalf of its members and lobbies for their passage each 
year, said spokeswoman Anne Charles. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a graduate of Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, was admitted 
to the California Bar in 1959 and maintains an active practice.

HEARINGS ON PROTECTION OF DESERT OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Launching what promises to be a bitter political struggle, a House subcommittee 
opened hearings Thursday on a sweeping proposal to extend federal wilderness 
and parkland protection to nearly 8 million acres of Southern California 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial legislation would establish three national parks east of Los 
Angeles and more than double the amount of land set aside as wilderness. It 
would greatly restrict access in these areas to tourists and automobiles, as 
well as mining, grazing and development. 
</P>
<P>
While supporters predicted that the bill has a good chance of passage in the 
House, its fate in the Senate is not clear. Similar legislation sponsored by 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) died last year, largely because Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.) strongly opposed it. Wilson's aides indicated Thursday that his 
position is unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willing to Negotiate 
</P>
<P>
But Cranston and Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), who are co-sponsoring this 
year's desert bill, said they are willing to negotiate key changes with Wilson 
and other opponents. They said the bill is an attempt to balance environmental 
concerns with the needs of people who use the desert for recreation and other 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"California's fragile desert is one of the crown jewels of America's public 
lands and it must be protected," Levine said. "The act of selecting wilderness 
is not a decision about which lands to scar. It is a decision about which lands 
to preserve." 
</P>
<P>
Levine told members of the House Interior subcommittee on national parks and 
public lands that nearly 12 million acres of publicly owned desert in Southern 
California are vulnerable to recreation, development, mining and grazing. He 
also charged that current federal policies designed to protect the desert are 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
But critics, including Wilson and four Republican congressmen who represent the 
sprawling area, blasted the measure as needless regulation that would reduce 
citizen access to the desert, cut off mining activities and threaten farmers' 
grazing rights. 
</P>
<P>
They also complained that Levine and Cranston had not conducted public hearings 
in communities affected by the measure. Although the House panel plans future 
Washington hearings, opponents said that it should travel to California to hear 
residents' views. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, the desert basically has gotten along awfully well without us 
over a long period of time, and we should be cautious about locking it up for 
all time," said Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), who is spearheading House 
opposition to the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said that only a fraction of California's desert lands are vulnerable to 
damage from tourist activities, such as the use of off-road vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the vast desert, almost nobody ever arrives," he said. "So there's 
really little need for more federal controls." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation covers a vast stretch of southeastern California, from Inyo 
County south 240 miles to the Mexican border. Most of the land is currently 
administered by the Bureau of Land Management and is open to mining, ranching 
and off-road vehicle use. 
</P>
<P>
Key sections of the bill would create new national parks in Joshua Tree 
National Monument and Death Valley National Monument, as well as in the east 
Mojave Desert. Nearly 8 million acres would be designated as wilderness area. 
The area includes open desert as well as the new national parks. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Scott, conservation director for the Sierra Club, suggested that the fate 
of the bill would be a "pivotal test" of congressional resolve to preserve 
endangered public lands. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that "vast areas of the desert have been irreparably scarred by 
off-road vehicles. And the desert is so fragile, the damage will probably never 
heal. What right have we to bequeath to generations upon generations to come 
millions of acres of scarred, eroded, lifeless desert lands?" 
</P>
<P>
However, a coalition of off-road vehicle users, farmers, miners and other 
residents of the area voiced bitter opposition. They said that a 1980 federal 
plan to protect the desert has worked well and should not be replaced by more 
restrictive legislation.

VAN DE KAMP'S STAND ON ABORTION RIGHTS GIVES PRIMARY BID A BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For months, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's political advisers have worried 
because he faces a tough Democratic primary in the 1990 governor's race against 
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, while, on the Republican side, 
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson is sailing unopposed to his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
But by charging this week that a crime initiative supported by Feinstein and 
Wilson could endanger a woman's right to abortion, Van de Kamp has suddenly 
strengthened himself with the liberal voters who dominate the Democratic 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
"At a minimum, this will have the effect of Jack Kennedy's telephone call to 
Coretta King in the 1960 presidential race," Democrat John Emerson said. "The 
word will get out quickly to the right people -- in this case those actively 
involved on the pro-choice side -- that Van de Kamp was sensitive and vigilant 
on their issue." 
</P>
<P>
Political professionals say privately that Democratic activists may now be 
swayed toward Van de Kamp and away from Feinstein on this issue even though 
both candidates are strongly pro-choice on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But there is also a potential danger in Van de Kamp's move. 
</P>
<P>
Should he wind up in the general election against Wilson, Van de Kamp's 
opposition to the crime initiative could be held up as proof that he is soft on 
crime, a deadly label with the conservative Democrats who make up a crucial 
swing vote in California elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson camp is already preparing to make such a charge, and will note that 
Van de Kamp had objected to the crime initiative long before he brought up the 
abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
"John Van de Kamp's objection to the crime initiative shows his true base -- 
the liberal left," Wilson campaign adviser Otto Bos said. "This is going to 
come back and haunt him if he makes it to the general election." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grass-Roots Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Republican strategists say that Van de Kamp may have so angered local law 
enforcement leaders and crime victims that they will mount strong grass-roots 
opposition to his gubernatorial candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Such movements can be potent in California. One cut property taxes by passing 
Proposition 13 in 1978; another helped oust former California Supreme Court 
Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Van de Kamp has found a cheap-shot way to undercut this initiative by saying 
that it could endanger a woman's right to abortion," Los Angeles County Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris said. "For him to suddenly have this objection 
after all the hard work we have put into this thing, and when his own staff was 
in on our discussions, is just outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Collene Campbell, who became a victims' rights activist after her brother, auto 
racer Mickey Thompson, was murdered, said: "We feel very bad that Mr. Van de 
Kamp has decided to oppose this initiative after the victims have been out just 
killing themselves trying to bring justice to California. . . . We are 
appalled, we are disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amend State Constitution 
</P>
<P>
The Crime Victims' Justice Reform initiative would amend the California 
Constitution if it qualifies for the June, 1990, ballot and is approved by 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
It is usually referred to as the "speedy trial initiative" because several of 
its provisions are aimed at unclogging California's courts. It would also make 
it easier for prosecutors to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, seeing the appeal to voters worried about crime, agreed to be the 
initiative's honorary chairman and to raise money for it. Feinstein, whose 
strategy is to portray herself as a tough Democrat, endorsed the measure last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
But the area where the initiative ran afoul of Van de Kamp is a section 
addressing the right to privacy, which was written into the California 
Constitution in 1972 and is a major protection of women seeking abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The crime initiative section reads, in part: "In criminal cases the right of a 
defendant to . . . privacy . . . shall be construed by the courts in this State 
in a manner consistent with the U.S. Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Privacy Guarantee 
</P>
<P>
What troubles Van de Kamp is that there is no explicit guarantee of privacy in 
the U.S. Constitution. Without that guarantee, the privacy that women have 
enjoyed since the 1973 Roe vs. Wade abortion decision could be eliminated if 
Roe is overturned. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorneys say their interest in the state's guarantee of privacy 
relates only to search-and-seizure cases. But Van de Kamp argues that the 
measure, whether intended or not, removes that guarantee and thus threatens to 
undo a woman's unqualified right to have an abortion in California. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who supports the crime initiative, said: 
"Obviously, the intent of the authors had nothing to do with reproductive 
rights, but the question raised (by Van de Kamp) is a legitimate question." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's objections could be addressed if the ballot argument for the 
crime initiative explicitly states that the intent is not to endanger the right 
to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Message of Vigilance 
</P>
<P>
But he wants to go further and remove the initiative language. The initiative's 
backers do not want to do that, in part because they would have to start all 
over gathering signatures before the Dec. 29 qualifying deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the measure is amended to please Van de Kamp, his message of vigilance 
on the issue has already been sent to Democratic primary voters in the 
governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson adviser Bos warns, however: "It's a short-term political gain."

A longtime criminal who prowled the streets of Stockholm in search of drugs and 
drink was convicted Thursday of murdering Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme in 
1986 and was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Christer Pettersson was found guilty by a Stockholm District Court panel of two 
professional judges and six lay jurors. 
</P>
<P>
The two judges said there was not enough evidence to convict Pettersson, but 
they were outvoted by the lay jurors. A simple majority was needed for 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson's attorney said he will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors accepted the testimony of Lisbeth Palme, who testified that she saw 
Pettersson, 42, standing near her husband moments after he was shot in the back 
at close range while walking home from a late movie on Feb. 28, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
An architect of Sweden's modern welfare state, Palme had been in his fourth 
term as prime minister. He cultivated a reputation as an international 
peacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
His death shocked many Swedes into the realization that their peaceful country 
was not immune to violence. 
</P>
<P>
In the years after the shooting, police looked for an international conspiracy 
in an investigation marred by public squabbles and frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
Three police chiefs and one justice minister resigned under pressure. No one 
claimed the $8-million reward that was offered for information leading to a 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, routine police work led to the verdict. Pettersson, an admitted abuser 
of amphetamines and alcohol, was questioned immediately after the slaying but 
released because he apparently had an alibi. 
</P>
<P>
A new team of investigators, sifting through previous statements, found holes 
in his story, and he was arrested Dec. 14. The trial began June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson was also convicted of endangering the life of Lisbeth Palme, who was 
grazed by a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
However, the reservations of Judges Carl-Anton Spak and Mikael af Geijerstam 
laid grounds for an appeal that could work in favor of Pettersson, who has 
maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
The murder weapon was never found. Neither Palme's widow nor any other witness 
testified to seeing Pettersson with a gun in his hand. No motive was 
established. 
</P>
<P>
In the 46-page decision, the court said Lisbeth Palme "with great certainty" 
identified Pettersson as the man she saw directly after her husband fell to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"The way she identified him at the trial is, according to the court, very 
convincing," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson testified that he was 18 miles away at a suburban train station when 
Palme was shot on a downtown street corner. One witness supported his 
testimony. Others disputed it. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson said he had left his suburban home to buy amphetamines but was on 
the way home when Palme was killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a bum," he told the court. "I belonged to the A-Team" -- a derisive 
label for drunks who sleep in parks and churchyards. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a killer but not a murderer," he said. "I did not kill Prime Minister 
Olof Palme." 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson was convicted of manslaughter in a stabbing in 1970 near the spot 
where Palme was killed. Since the age of 19, he has been convicted of more than 
60 crimes, mostly assault and theft.

71 ABOARD DC-10 DEAD IN LIBYAN CRASH 
</P>

<P>
Conflicting reports emerged Thursday over whether mechanical problems may have 
played a role in the crash of a South Korean DC-10 jetliner while attempting to 
land at the airport in Tripoli, Libya. At least 71 of the 199 people aboard 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Dense fog early Thursday, which forced another airliner to reroute its flight 
to nearby Malta only an hour before the crash, could have been another 
contributing factor, Libyan officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second crash involving a DC-10 in little over a week. On July 19, a 
United Airlines DC-10 crash landed in Sioux City, Iowa, after losing its tail 
engine and its hydraulic systems in flight. That crash, in which 111 people 
died, was the latest of several disasters involving mechanical or structural 
failures on aging civilian aircraft over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
In Seoul, Korean Air officials said the DC-10 that crashed had been purchased 
in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Airport authorities said Korean Air Flight 803 from Seoul undershot the runway 
at 7:30 a.m. Thursday. They said they lost contact with the plane about 15 
minutes before the crash. During the landing, the jet slammed into a house and 
burst into flames. Four people were killed on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Mustapha Maghrebi, head of the Libyan investigating panel, said it was not 
known whether pilot error or mechanical failure caused the crash, Associated 
Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
He said the pilot, who was among the survivors, told authorities that he was 
probably wrong to try to land with poor visibility. 
</P>
<P>
The airline earlier quoted pilot Kim Ho Jung, 54, as saying, "The airport was 
shrouded in a dense fog and visibility was poor when I approached," AP 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet Aeroflot airliner, coming in an hour before the crash, was diverted to 
Malta because of the fog, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The official Libyan news agency Jana said the plane came down about a mile 
short of the runway, grazing the top of one house, plowing through another and 
hitting several cars before breaking apart and bursting into flames in an olive 
grove. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers were South Korean workers employed on construction 
projects in Libya. However, 10 foreigners -- seven Libyans and three Japanese 
-- were also on board, Jana said. 
</P>
<P>
Television footage of the disaster site showed that the plane broke into three 
pieces upon impact, with the tail section wedged into the rubble of one of the 
two homes struck by the airliner before it exploded in flames. 
</P>
<P>
Airline officials said that the flight, which originated in Seoul and made 
stops in Bangkok and Jidda, Saudi Arabia, carried 181 passengers along with 18 
crew members. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's crash was the latest of several recent disasters for Korean Air, 
formerly known as Korean Air Lines (KAL). 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 29, 1987, a Korean Air jet exploded over the Andaman Sea near Myanmar, 
formerly Burma. A North Korean terrorist later confessed to having placed a 
bomb on the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 1, 1983, Soviet fighters shot down KAL Flight 007 after it flew into a 
sensitive Soviet military airspace. All 269 people aboard were killed.

GROUND ALL DC-10S, PASSENGER GROUP SUGGESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing "inherent design flaws," the International Airline Passengers Assn. 
suggested Thursday that the DC-10 airliner may have to be grounded "to protect 
and safeguard the lives of those exposed to the perils" of flying on the jumbo 
jet. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Long Beach headquarters of McDonnell Douglas, manufacturer of 
the jetliner, responded that the plane is a reliable, well-designed aircraft 
and called the demands of the 11,000-member airline passengers' group 
"ridiculous." The plane has long been certified as safe by the Federal Aviation 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The association's petition to the FAA -- and McDonnell Douglas' response -- 
came a few hours after a Korean Air DC-10 crashed while attempting to land in 
Tripoli, Libya, killing at least 71 of the 199 on board. Unconfirmed accounts 
indicated that the pilot had reported engine trouble before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Iowa Crash Recalled 
</P>
<P>
Just eight days earlier, a United Airlines DC-10 crashed while attempting an 
emergency landing in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 111 of the 276 aboard. 
Preliminary reports indicate that one of the plane's three engines exploded 
during that flight, knocking out the jetliner's hydraulic control systems. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation sources were quick to point out that McDonnell Douglas does not build 
the engines used in its planes -- the engines in various models are 
manufactured by General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to FAA Administrator James P. Busey, association chairman James 
E. Dunne urged that the FAA take "immediate and aggressive action" to see that 
any design flaws in the DC-10 are corrected. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the crash at Sioux City, in which fragments from the exploding engine 
caused the plane's three, redundant hydraulic systems to fail simultaneously, 
Dunne recalled an earlier IAPA recommendation to the FAA, which read, in part: 
</P>
<P>
"The various parallel hydraulic and electrical systems of the DC-10 should be 
sufficiently separated from each other by structure or distance, so that in the 
event of accidental damage to one system, it would be unlikely that the other 
backup systems could be affected by the same source of damage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manufacturer Responds 
</P>
<P>
Dale Warren, a McDonnell Douglas vice president, responded Thursday afternoon 
that the problems at Sioux City did not result from a lack of system 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
Warren said the three systems were cut in three different places -- separated 
by at least five feet -- in the tail section of the plane when shrapnel from 
the exploding engine flew in all directions in what federal investigators have 
said was an extremely unusual disintegration of virtually the entire engine 
shaft assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say the loss of hydraulic fluid from all three systems meant the 
pilots could no longer use the plane's normal control surfaces -- rudder, 
ailerons, horizontal stabilizers, flaps, slats and spoilers -- and had to rely 
solely on the two remaining engines to control the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Warren said McDonnell Douglas has ordered no changes as a result of the Sioux 
City crash, but he said the company is studying possible ways to better protect 
the hydraulic systems. 
</P>
<P>
Warren noted that DC-10s have carried more than 745 million passengers more 
than 7 billion miles since they went into service in July, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"McDonnell Douglas believes the overall safety record of the DC-10 is worthy of 
public confidence," Warren said.

HOUSE DEFENSE BILL SHIFTS WEAPONS FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
CUTS IN NUCLEAR ARMS SPENDING CALLED 'MICHAEL DUKAKIS' BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The House Thursday passed a $305-billion defense spending bill for fiscal 1990 
that takes money from President Bush's nuclear weapons programs to continue 
funding several conventional systems that the Pentagon does not want. 
</P>
<P>
The House-passed bill, adopted by a vote of 261 to 162, has drawn strong 
opposition from the Administration on grounds that it upsets the priorities 
that the President and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney set for the military in 
the fiscal year begining Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Even House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) acknowledged: 
"We have pretty well shredded George Bush's strategic program. . . . We got a 
Michael Dukakis defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We got no Midgetman, no rail MX, big cuts in SDI and a slowdown of the B-2," 
he said, referring to two high-profile missile programs, the Strategic Defense 
Initiative and the B-2 Stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of House action, the President is looking to the Senate to bring 
the final legislation back into line with his policies. The Senate, usually 
more supportive of the President's military proposals than the House, is 
expected to complete work on a fiscal 1990 defense spending bill before 
Congress begins a summer recess late next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate demonstrated its willingness to support the President Thursday night 
by voting, 50 to 47, to defeat a proposal offered by Sen. J. Bennett Johnston 
(D-La.) to slash $558 million from the Strategic Defense Initiative. The 
amendment would have cut funding for the program to about $4 billion, or about 
$800 million less than was requested by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before passing its version of the defense spending measure, the House 
agreed by voice vote to eliminate all funding for the single-warhead Midgetman 
missile program. Republicans initiated the move in retaliation for the House's 
decision Wednesday night to trim $502 million for deployment of the 10-warhead 
MX missile on railway cars. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether this vote would permanently scuttle an agreement 
negotiated earlier this year between the President and Democratic congressional 
leaders to proceed with both the Midgetman and MX rail deployment. Bush had 
agreed to continue funding for Midgetman, which the Democrats prefer, in 
exchange for continued Democratic support for MX. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Bush's decisions to proceed with production of the Stealth bomber and 
to continue development of the so-called "Star Wars" nuclear defense system 
were also sorely challenged in the House. Liberals as well as a few fiscal 
conservatives questioned why Bush is investing in these expensive systems at a 
time when the United States appears to be on the verge of an arms control pact 
with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Under the House measure, funding for the Stealth bomber would be halted until 
the Pentagon comes up with a way to scale down the estimated $70 billion total 
cost of the program; "Star Wars" research would get $3.1 billion, or $1.5 
billion less than the Administration requested, and the MX rail garrison 
program would be slowed down by the $502 million cut. 
</P>
<P>
But the money saved by these cuts would not be returned to the Treasury. 
Instead, it would go to purchase a number of weapons that the Pentagon is 
trying to cancel -- including the F-14D Tomcat fighter plane, the V-22 
tilt-rotor helicopter and the National Aerospace Plane. 
</P>
<P>
On all of these procurement issues -- with the possible exception of the 
funding for "Star Wars" -- the Senate appeared ready to take the opposite view 
and adhere to the Administration's position. As a result, it is doubtful that 
all of the changes made by the House in Bush's proposed Pentagon budget will 
survive in the final legislation.

BLOCH REPORTED TELLING FBI OF PAY FROM KGB

Felix S. Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspected of spying for the Soviet Union, 
told FBI agents he had been paid "a lot of money" by the Soviet KGB security 
and intelligence agency during a relationship of "many years," the New York 
Times reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch's reported admissions came in his one brief interview with the FBI on 
June 22, the newspaper said, citing an "official involved in the case" as its 
source. 
</P>
<P>
Informed of this report, three Administration sources familiar with the Bloch 
case said in Washington on Thursday night that they had not been told of such 
admissions. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch reportedly refused to discuss with the FBI any possible spying activities 
or his motives.

UAW DEFEAT SEEN AS SIGN OF DISINTEGRATION OF ORGANIZED LABOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crushing defeat suffered by the United Auto Workers at Nissan's Smyrna, 
Tenn., plant shows that traditional industrial unionism remains in decline in 
the United States, and labor organizations must look beyond the factory if they 
are to remain a force in American life, labor relations experts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although pro-union observers emphasized the steep odds the UAW had faced in 
trying to organize at Smyrna and portrayed the election as an isolated case, 
others said that the defeat was just the latest in a long string of events -- 
including the ongoing Eastern Airlines strike -- that could ultimately lead to 
the disintegration of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
"It contributes to the increasing spiral of anger and mistrust," said Charles 
Heckscher, a professor of human resource management at Harvard Business School, 
"and one possible outcome is the vanishing of organized labor from the national 
scene. Another possible result is major conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Heckscher said that those outcomes might occur simultaneously, with increasing 
militancy among local activists combining with eroding union power at the 
national level. "It's a discouraging sign in terms of working out a positive 
outcome to the current decline of the labor-relations system," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel J. B. Mitchell, director of the Institute for Industrial Relations at 
UCLA, observed that "traditional union organizing, in terms of the number of 
elections held, plummeted in the early 1980s, and it never revived again." 
</P>
<P>
Stepped-up efforts to organize workers in the service sector as well as 
attempts to develop a new, more collaborative style of labor-management 
relations in the factory have failed to stem the decline in union power. The 
only growth in recent years, Mitchell said, has been among government workers, 
and he is not optimistic that unions can further capitalize on that success in 
the white-collar area. 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Freedman, an economist with the Conference Board in New York, said that 
organized labor must recognize that wage-oriented demands will not be met in an 
era of global competition, and unions therefore must meet the needs of other 
workers in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were a labor leader -- which I never would be because I'm a woman -- I 
would be figuring out what it is that unorganized service workers and clerical 
workers really need," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She advocated a union philosophy that draws on the collective self-help 
traditions of unionism, one which would be far more concerned with health, 
child and personal security issues and would provide working people with a 
"communal group." 
</P>
<P>
Freedman said the Eastern strike showed how unions have failed to adjust. 
Eastern workers were "striking against the economic realities of a deregulated 
industry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Rosow, president of the Work in America Institute, agreed that unions 
have "not caught up with the needs of women and white-collar workers." 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing for (the UAW) is to broaden (its) base," he said, and 
he contended that the UAW was doing it. 
</P>
<P>
But Rosow said that the Smyrna vote was always an "uphill fight" and that it 
would be "making a mountain out of a molehill to read into it broader meanings 
about the UAW or the union movement." He pointed to the recent victories by the 
steelworkers' union as evidence that, in industries that are organized, unions 
remain a dynamic force.

ATLANTIC CITY MAYOR, 12 OTHERS ARRESTED ON CORRUPTION CHARGES

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor James L. Usry, a reformist candidate swept into office on the heels of a 
political corruption scandal, was arrested Thursday on charges of bribery, 
conspiracy and official misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve other people, including the City Council president, the chairman of the 
zoning board and the former housing authority director, also were arrested 
after an investigation that one official said showed this seaside resort was 
"up for sale." 
</P>
<P>
"Our investigation uncovered the deplorable circumstances in which corruption 
has reached the highest levels of Atlantic City municipal government," the 
state police superintendent, Col. Clinton L. Pagano, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Usry, 67, a former Harlem Globetrotter and city teacher, was elected mayor five 
years ago after his predecessor was implicated in an influence-peddling scandal 
and lost a recall election. Usry is also president of the National Conference 
of Black Mayors. 
</P>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. Peter Perretti Jr. said none of the charges or investigations 
against Usry and the other city officials involve the casino industry. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal complaint against the suspects, including a 14th person not yet 
arrested, alleged five separate but overlapping conspiracies. Among them was an 
attempt to gain control of a lucrative Boardwalk electric cart business and a 
gift shop franchise at the Atlantic City International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Usry was charged with bribery, conspiracy, official misconduct and accepting 
unlawful gifts. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican mayor said nothing in court during a bail hearing; neither he 
nor his attorney acknowledged reporters' questions afterward. Usry and the 
other city officials were released on their own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grand Jury Bound 
</P>
<P>
The city officials do not have to forfeit their offices on the basis of a 
criminal complaint, Perretti said. Attorneys from the state Division of 
Criminal Justice are expected to present a case to a state grand jury within 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Before state police began their roundup Thursday morning, they first went to 
Usry's home with a search warrant. Police confiscated $6,000 in cash, alleged 
to be conspiracy money, Pagano said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests resulted from an investigation that began in November, prompted by 
a complaint by Atlantic City businessman Albert Black, the attorney general 
said. Black said some city officials had demanded a bribe from him to get a 
business proposal approved by the zoning board.

KHASHOGGI FREED ON $10-MILLION BAIL; FINANCIAL DRAIN DISCLOSED

Adnan Khashoggi, the grounded jet-setting financier, was freed on $10-million 
bail Thursday, traveling by rented limousine from his jail cell to his heavily 
mortgaged Manhattan penthouse where he will be monitored electronically by a 
special bracelet he must wear at all times. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that the courts have granted me bail," Khashoggi said as he stood 
in a wrinkled leisure suit outside the federal courthouse. "I am anxious to 
begin work on my defense and look forward to clearing my name at trial. I 
assure you I will be here for the trial." 
</P>
<P>
The short, balding arms dealer, a smile fixed to his face, then tried to walk 
down the steps. He was engulfed by shouting, pushing photographers. Several 
people were knocked to the ground. In the melee, television cameras bumped 
Khashoggi's shoulders. Lenses crowded within an inch of his face. Finally, a 
wedge of U.S. marshals helped him to his car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charged in Marcos Case 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi, 54, who was a key middleman in secret White House arms sales to 
Iran, is charged with fraud and obstruction of justice in connection to claims 
he helped Ferdinand E. and Imelda Marcos plunder Philippines national assets. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Judge John F. Keenan granted his application for bail Thursday over the 
strenuous objections of prosecutors who argued Khashoggi had ample resources to 
flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
As a condition of bail, the Saudi businessman -- once regarded as the world's 
richest man -- had been required to disclose details of his financial empire. 
It provided a rare insight into an empire in decline. 
</P>
<P>
Although Khashoggi's financial statement claimed a net worth of $54 million, 
$46 million of that amount is listed as equity in real estate subject to 
foreclosure proceedings in New York and Malaga, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi's statement revealed that dozens of his companies around the world 
are in trouble -- bankrupt, dormant or abandoned. Many of his bank accounts, 
scattered around the world, have only pennies. Some are overdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Account Overdrawn 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures surprised one of his former business executives who said that 
in recent years Khashoggi "could have written a million dollar check" against 
any of his bank accounts. Today, however, his balance in Monte Carlo's Bank of 
Credit &amp; Commerce, for example, was listed as only 47 cents. And his 
account at the Champs-Elysees branch of the Credit Commercial de France bank in 
Paris was listed as overdrawn by $250.68. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi also is nearly $2 million in arrears on household expenses -- 
reportedly owing everyone from the maids to the lawn mower repairman -- at his 
homes in Marbella and Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi's statement for the court, listing assets of $141.8 million and 
liabilities of $88 million, also showed personal credit card debts of $81,000. 
It also listed "cash in hand" of $5 million and cash in banks of $643,746. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Khashoggi's brothers Essam and Amr posted two $5-million checks 
drawn on Barclay's Bank for bail. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan set March 14 as the trial date.

NORMAN KAPLAN; BEGAN GROUP FOR BLIND YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norman Kaplan, who 36 years ago founded a nonprofit foundation seeking to 
integrate blind children into a seeing society, died Wednesday night of heart 
failure at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The founder and executive director emeritus of the Foundation for the Junior 
Blind was 65 and had retired in 1985 while remaining a spokesman and adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan had entered the public relations business after Navy service in World 
War II and through a client became aware of a lack of recreational facilities 
for blind children in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Using a $5,000 grant, he began a nonprofit foundation that in its initial year 
of existence served 15 children. 
</P>
<P>
Today that effort involves 400 to 500 children a year in a variety of special 
education classes, outdoor trips and the foundation's best-known activity -- 
Camp Bloomfield -- a summer program for blind individuals of all ages in the 
Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
As Kaplan's foundation grew to its present 5.5-acre facility near Los Angeles 
International Airport, its founder kept pace by attending special education 
classes. In 1976 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of 
Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, his foundation -- which today also serves blind adults -- 
sponsored river-rafting trips to the Colorado River, day journeys to farms 
where blind children helped harvest crops and outings to the San Bernardino 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"Blind people are normal people," Kaplan once said. "Blindness is a nuisance, 
not a handicap." 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Nadia, two daughters, two grandchildren and two 
sisters. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m Sunday at the foundation, 5300 Angeles 
Vista Blvd. In lieu of flowers, the family is asking donations to the 
foundation.

FRANCES CLARKE SAYERS, 91; AUTHOR OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frances Clarke Sayers, librarian, teacher and author who was known nationally 
for her efforts to improve the quality of children's literature, has died at 
91. 
</P>
<P>
The former UCLA lecturer suffered a stroke and died Monday at her Ojai home. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Sayers' work, said Dorothy Anderson, an assistant professor at UCLA's 
Graduate School of Library and Information Science, "changed the consciousness 
of several generations of people involved in children's literature." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Sayers, known for her outspokenness, once even publicly chastised Walt 
Disney for making commercial use of children's stories. She also warned 
librarians not to become "cherished Queen Bees and warm and comfortable fairy 
godmothers." 
</P>
<P>
She was the author of five children's books, including the popular "Bluebonnets 
for Lucinda" (1934) and was co-editor of "The Anthology of Children's 
Literature" (1958 and 1970.) 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the Carnegie Library School in Pittsburgh, she joined the New 
York Public Library in 1918 and served there until 1923 when she came to 
California and married. She was children's librarian at the Los Angeles Public 
Library in 1923-24 and at University Elementary School in 1924-25. She also 
lectured at college and university library schools throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
She returned to the New York Public Library as superintendent of children's 
literature in 1941, remained there until 1952 and then joined the UCLA 
Department of English as a lecturer in children's literature. 
</P>
<P>
When the UCLA School of Library Service opened in 1960, she was asked to join 
the faculty by founding Dean Lawrence Clark Powell. She retired in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
In the forward to her "Summoned by Books: Essays and Speeches by Frances Clarke 
Sayers," Powell wrote of her "gift of celebration, of stamina, scholarship and 
vision, the passion for people, especially young people, and for books, old and 
new. . . ."

RULING OPENS OFFICERS' RECORDS TO DEFENDANTS; 
</P>
<P>
DIVIDED SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS DECISION LIMITING ACCESS ON BRUTALITY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A closely divided state Supreme Court on Thursday refused to limit the ability 
of a criminal defendant to find out whether an arresting officer has been 
previously accused of brutality. 
</P>
<P>
With a key vote from newly appointed Justice Joyce L. Kennard, the court held 4 
to 3 that defendants may obtain such information from confidential police 
personnel files without presenting proof they or others were victims of 
excessive force by the officer. 
</P>
<P>
The justices reversed a Court of Appeal ruling that had held a defendant 
seeking file access must offer eyewitness accounts of his arrest or have 
"personal knowledge" of the previous complaints against the officer. In an 
opinion by Justice Marcus M. Kaufman, the Supreme Court said access could be 
obtained if the defendant asserts a "reasonable belief" prior complaints may 
have been made. Such a belief could be based on the circumstances of his own 
arrest, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
Any file data that is released must be privately screened first by a judge and 
is usually limited to the name, address and telephone number of previous 
complainants, the court noted. 
</P>
<P>
Such a process, Kaufman wrote, "strikes a fair and workable balance between the 
need of criminal defendants for all relevant and reasonably accessible 
information and the legitimate concerns of peace officers to shield from 
disclosure confidential information not essential to an effective defense." 
</P>
<P>
The decision reflected an unusual split among the five conservative justices 
appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian. Kennard and Kaufman joined two liberals, 
Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard, to form the majority. The other 
three Deukmejian appointees formed the minority. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Justice Edward A. Panelli, joined by Justice David N. Eagleson, 
observed that demands for police personnel file information now have become 
routine for defendants accused of resisting arrest or battery on a peace 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ruling, he said, will further invite defendants to attempt "fishing 
expeditions" into confidential files without an adequate basis to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"Good cause (for obtaining access) is certainly not satisfied by an unsupported 
statement that the police officers involved used excessive force in the past or 
by a defense counsel's reiteration of the defendant's self-serving story that 
the officers used excessive force in his arrest," Panelli wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate dissent, Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas expressed concern the 
ruling would lead to "burdensome demands" for file information and joined 
Panelli and Eagleson in urging the Legislature to review the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Samara C. Marion, a Santa Cruz attorney representing the defendant in the case, 
welcomed Thursday's ruling as a reaffirmation of the rights of criminal 
defendants. "There is no reason to prevent the public from knowing about an 
officer with a history of police brutality," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marion said also she is "very happy" that Kennard, who joined the court only 
last spring, had voted in the majority. "I'm excited about her," said Marion. 
"She has great potential." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald D. Bowden, an attorney who represented the city of Santa Cruz in urging 
tighter restrictions on file-access, said the ruling would allow police files 
to be opened based on "nothing more than unfounded rumor" of excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be very demoralizing to police officers who will know now 
that anything in their personnel file will be turned over to the very people 
who beat them up," Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
William B. Sage of Huntington Beach, an attorney for the California Police 
Officers Assn., voiced dismay over the ruling and said the organization may ask 
the Legislature to draft a new law better protecting police personnel files. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in December, 1987, when police in Santa Cruz responded to a 
report of a man brandishing a knife. According to the police report, a struggle 
ensued after the suspect, Howard Kennedy, became agitated when the two officers 
sought to search him. Kennedy swung his fist and missed and an officer 
responded with a punch of his own to the suspect's face, the police said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy was charged with resisting arrest and exhibiting a knife. In pretrial 
proceedings, his attorney sought access to the officers' personnel files, 
submitting an affidavit saying he was "informed and believes" the police used 
excessive force against Kennedy and that other complaints against them "may 
have been filed by members of the public." 
</P>
<P>
The process, authorized under a 1978 state law, is also used in civil rights 
suits alleging police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
A trial court judge upheld the request but a state Court of Appeal in San Jose 
reversed that ruling, saying the lawyer must have "personal knowledge" previous 
complaints existed. Attorneys for Kennedy, noting that the decision conflicted 
with other appeal court rulings, took the case to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, overturning the appeal court decision, concluded that the law 
did not intend to require first-hand knowledge of previous complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, noted Kaufman, an Assembly committee at the time had 
dropped the personal-knowledge requirement from the legislation, pointing out 
that if a defendant "already had the particulars of the records, he would not 
need" to seek access to police files. 
</P>
<P>
In Kennedy's case, the court said, even though the facts of the arrest were not 
firmly established, it was "altogether fair and rational" for the suspect's 
lawyer to seek access to the officers' records in view of Kennedy's assertions 
he had been forced to defend himself against excessive force.

NANCY REAGAN TO HELP DRUG CENTERS; 
</P>
<P>
PLAN FOR GRANTS IS ANNOUNCED DURING VISIT TO PACOIMA CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former First Lady Nancy Reagan launched a new phase of her anti-drug crusade 
during a visit to a Pacoima drug rehabilitation center Thursday, her first 
visit to a Los Angeles drug center since leaving the White House in January. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with women clients and their children at Via Avanta drug center, 
Mrs. Reagan announced that her foundation -- formed in January -- soon will 
distribute grants to similar centers in the Los Angeles area. The grants will 
be small this year, but Mrs. Reagan said if people will contribute, the amount 
available may grow to support programs across the country. 
</P>
<P>
However, she indicated that she is unlikely to become involved with another 
Nancy Reagan Center project similar to the one proposed for nearby Lake View 
Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
"That center is gone, finished," she said. Asked whether she would consider 
founding a Nancy Reagan center at another site, she said, "I'll be busy with 
the foundation." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors' protests that the proposed 210-bed rehabilitation, research and 
training center would draw more drugs and crime to their area prompted Mrs. 
Reagan to withdraw from the project in May. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing I wanted to do was upset a community," she said Thursday, 
reiterating her reasons for backing out after more than a year of negotiations 
to finance, buy and renovate the former Lake View Medical Center buildings. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials of Phoenix House, the nonprofit company that hoped to make 
the center the hub of Mrs. Reagan's "Just Say No" crusade, insist that they are 
continuing to look for another site for her center. 
</P>
<P>
About $4.3 million in cash and pledges was collected for Phoenix House in Nancy 
Reagan's name, according to Suzanne Marx, the national campaign chairman. Use 
of that money is "still under negotiation," said John Gustafson, executive 
director of The Nancy Reagan Foundation. But Gustafson said it probably will 
never be distributed under the grant program announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Gustafson said, drug abuse treatment and education centers around Los 
Angeles are being reviewed as possible grant candidates. He said requests for 
proposals will go out by the end of the week. He refused to disclose how much 
money the foundation has raised since January. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a Nancy Reagan Center eventually materializes, Gustafson said it would 
be just one small piece of Mrs. Reagan's overall battle against drugs. Mostly, 
he said, the foundation plans to concentrate its resources on supporting 
existing programs rather than trying to start new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot going on out there," Gustafson said. "The most important thing 
in foundation work is not to duplicate efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Although Via Avanta is not under consideration for a grant this year, Gustafson 
said the unusual nature of the program led Mrs. Reagan to choose it for her 
visit. The live-in center is one of a handful in California that caters to 
women who have children or are pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen this kind of a program before . . . they tell me there are a 
couple of others," Mrs. Reagan said. "I think it's very important, especially 
for young mothers." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan spent nearly an hour with residents Thursday, asking them about 
their backgrounds and hopes for the future. She admonished them to try to break 
the addiction cycle by keeping their children off drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Later, she said she was amazed by the severity of abuse, neglect and family 
drug abuse the women said had led them to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The residents were equally impressed that Mrs. Reagan chose them. One 
26-year-old woman, who said she was a gang member and PCP user for the past 11 
years, said, "I've watched her make history and here she comes along and she's 
interested in us." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the mothers living at Via Avanta have had their children taken away by 
authorities because of drug abuse. During the nine- to 18-month program, the 
center tries to retrieve the children from foster homes and other court-ordered 
placements once the staff decides the mothers are ready, said Christine 
Westfall, clinical coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The children come to live with their mothers at the center, which provides day 
care, a nursery school and classes for elementary school children. Older 
children attend nearby public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Program Director Marcellus Robinson said 76% of the women who complete the 
program remain drug-free for at least a year and only about 20% of them drop 
out. Robinson attributes the high success rate largely to the motivating 
influence of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Via Avanta is run by the Didi Hirsch Mental Health Center, which operates five 
other drug or mental health centers in Los Angeles. The organization was 
founded in 1942 by the United Hostesses of Beverly Hills, a charitable group. 
It continues to be funded by the hostesses and by United Way and Los Angeles 
County.

SWEEPER GETS THE BRUSHOFF; 
</P>
<P>
SAN PEDRO RESIDENTS SAY A CLEAN STREET IS NOT WORTH THE PARKING TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Betty Kraker has been getting her San Pedro neighbors worked up these days 
about street sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, the self-described "busy landlady" has unwittingly earned her 
neighborhood a peculiar place in Los Angeles history. The six-block collage of 
crowded apartments, duplexes and bungalows this week became the only 
neighborhood in the city to insist on surrendering its "No Parking" signs. 
</P>
<P>
The signs ban parking for two hours twice a week so that street sweepers can 
swerve close to the curb and grind dirt and grime from the gutters. But Kraker 
said they also invite pesky parking enforcement officers who ticket their cars 
with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials say the signs are a hot commodity from Sylmar to 
Wilmington because posted streets get swept weekly rather than monthly. Only 
25% of the city's 6,400 miles of streets have the signs but none have been 
added since 1975 because of a money shortage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It Took a Year 
</P>
<P>
It has taken Kraker and her neighbors along the 500 and 600 blocks of 18th and 
19th streets and the 1800 and 1900 blocks of Grand Avenue a year to convince 
city officials that they really do not want the signs. This week the Los 
Angeles City Council, following harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores' 
reluctant lead, voted to move the signs to Wilmington, where residents have 
complained for years about dirty streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a couple requests a week for these things," said an incredulous Curtis 
Bianchi, who heads the city's street sweeping operations. "I've never heard of 
a neighborhood asking to remove them." 
</P>
<P>
Well listen up and listen good, Kraker says: The signs aren't all that they're 
cracked up to be. 
</P>
<P>
"People are getting too many tickets," she said this week. "We have a parking 
problem here, and they come and ticket your cars before the sweeper comes. 
Sometimes the street cleaner never shows up, but the ticketing comes every week 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Kraker and her neighbors say they would rather take brooms to the streets 
themselves than awake every Monday and Tuesday morning dreading an encounter 
with a parking enforcement officer. Most houses don't have driveways and those 
that have garages have filled them with cars or junk. The street is their only 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get up 10 minutes too late, everybody else has moved their cars," said 
Mary Samaras, who lives two houses down wind-swept 19th Street from Kraker's 
duplex. "So you get to walk in your pajamas or bathrobe two blocks away, or 
park all the way on Pacific and look like you are from a halfway house." 
</P>
<P>
While the city does not keep records on how many tickets it issues in the 
neighborhood, residents say virtually no one has escaped unscathed. Dee Barron, 
who lives on 18th Street, said at last count she had accumulated 17. 
</P>
<P>
City officials acknowledge enforcement has been strict, but say there is no 
other way to assure the streets are clear for the sweepers. Flores described 
the enforcement as "avid." 
</P>
<P>
"There was no laxness," she said. "If you just stopped your car for awhile 
because you forgot your lunch or something, you got a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
At $28 a shot, residents say, they were getting priced out of their own 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Flores agreed to take down the signs only after receiving a petition with more 
than 100 signatures, touring the neighborhood and meeting with several 
residents in Samaras' living room. Flores said she made it clear to the group 
that once the signs are gone, the neighborhood will not get them back. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't believe it," Flores said this week. "Everybody in my district 
is screaming for these things. It is probably the No. 1 request I get from 
every Neighborhood Watch and homeowners group I go to." 
</P>
<P>
Wilmington residents were equally surprised about their spate of good luck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lucky for Us' 
</P>
<P>
"We said, 'Gee whiz, you don't want them?' " said Simie Seaman, president of 
the Banning Park Neighborhood Assn. "Gee whiz, how lucky for us!" 
</P>
<P>
Susan Prichard, Flores' Wilmington deputy, said she was greeted with a round of 
applause at a recent Neighborhood Watch meeting in northeast Wilmington where 
the signs will be posted. The area, which is in the shadow of an auto parts 
yard, has a particular problem with dirt and abandoned cars. Prichard said 
homeowners see the signs as a long-overdue solution. 
</P>
<P>
But Kraker has little patience for such talk. The former lab technician and 
nutritionist who has heralded several other neighborhood causes said she hopes 
the signs work out for her neighbors in Wilmington. But she says she knows 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"In Wilmington and places like that they don't know what the problem is," 
Kraker said. "We thought at first it was going to be good, too. But after we 
had all of these problems, ticketing and things, you realize it isn't. These 
people think that street cleaning is going to solve all of their cleaning 
problems. But it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposed to Removal 
</P>
<P>
City street-maintenance officials have opposed removing the signs all along. In 
a letter to Flores, Patrick Howard, director of the Bureau of Street 
Maintenance, warned that taking down the signs "would have an adverse effect on 
the cleanliness of the community as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
Howard said the restricted parking program was particularly effective in 
neighborhoods such as Kraker's, where intensive residential development makes 
normal machine sweeping difficult because so many cars are parked on the 
streets. Under bureau guidelines, on average at least one in four curbside 
parking spaces must be occupied when sweepers make their rounds in order for a 
street to qualify for signs. 
</P>
<P>
Yet all the talk about dirtier streets doesn't worry Kraker and her neighbors. 
They say that they are used to keeping their neighborhood picked up anyway 
because harbor breezes blow litter and other debris on their sidewalks and 
lawns. "Tuesday's filth just blows over on Monday's clean side," said Samaras. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Kraker let it be known that she was concerned others might not 
understand why their neighborhood would want to do away with a city service. 
She pointed out that she and her neighbors also fought for a "Slow-Stop Ahead" 
sign along Grand where cars were speeding through the intersection at 19th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of looks bad when you say you don't want street cleaning," she said. 
"I don't want to be known as a street cleaner or anything. It is just a normal 
thing. It is like mowing your lawn." 
</P>

HONORED 'OFFICER' TOOK A BITE OUT OF CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two dozen Inglewood police officers were jammed in the corner of Jino's Pizza 
shop honoring a legendary colleague who netted more than 1,000 arrests during a 
6 1/2-year career. 
</P>
<P>
The guest of honor, meanwhile, was sitting politely on the floor, begging for a 
piece of pizza crust. 
</P>
<P>
Welz, a 9 1/2-year-old German shepherd whose career officially came to an end 
this month, received the same send-off career officers typically get -- a 
gathering of old friends, a few war stories and a commendation or two. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever anyone retires, they should be recognized," said Detective Joe Suarez 
of the Los Angeles Police Department's Gang Enforcement Team, who was on hand 
Wednesday night to present the dog with a plaque for tracking down a 
multiple-homicide suspect May 16. 
</P>
<P>
Welz sniffed out the armed suspect, who had eluded Los Angeles police officers 
by hiding under a parked car in Inglewood. After taking a rap over the head, 
the dog subdued the suspect until officers arrived. It turned out to be his 
last arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just another day at the office for him," said Welz's handler, Sgt. John 
W. Bell. "He's been beaten, kicked and shot at. He's found criminals in the 
most unlikely places -- on (roofs), in trees, in cars, where it would take an 
army of officers to find someone, he does it." 
</P>
<P>
Welz, who was born in Germany in 1980, proved his excellence in numerous 
statewide competitions. He became the first canine with the Inglewood Police 
Department to win a gold medal in the statewide Police Olympics and a silver 
medal in the World Games, an international competition. While on duty, the dog 
was known for his fearlessness, his tracking skills and his ability to discern 
the good guys from the bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Welz was the dog that set the standard for the other handlers throughout 
Southern California," said Tony Bairos, a Bakersfield kennel operator who has 
imported German police dogs for departments across the nation. "Welz was the 
envy of many, many handlers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Gentle Side 
</P>
<P>
And while Welz (pronounced Velz) was recognized in law enforcement circles as 
the ultimate street dog, his owner is proud of the other side of his character 
-- his gentleness and "his uncanny ability to make people at ease." 
</P>
<P>
When not sprinting down city streets after gang members, Welz would spend time 
in senior citizen homes, hospitals and schools allowing just about anybody to 
pat him on the head. 
</P>
<P>
"The school kids would say, 'He only bites bad people so I must be good,' " 
Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
The dog began his career with Bell in 1983 at the age of 2 1/2. He is now 9 
1/2, a few months past the usual retirement age for a police dog, and a senior 
citizen in human terms. 
</P>
<P>
Although Welz is still a very good police dog, Bell said, he was beginning to 
slow down and show some signs of age. 
</P>
<P>
Like many who retire, it has taken time for Welz to adjust to the far less 
strenuous life style. When Bell first began leaving the house in the morning 
alone, he said, Welz seemed disappointed and would whine and cry by the front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
But Welz is becoming more mellow, Bell says. He has added a few pounds and is 
beginning to acknowledge his new role as a house pet. 
</P>
<P>
And now it's Bell, a 16-year veteran with the Inglewood police who was recently 
promoted from an officer in the K-9 Corps to a sergeant in the patrol division, 
who has the adjusting to do. 
</P>
<P>
Bell and his four-legged partner were virtually inseparable over the last six 
years. They worked together all day, worked out together on the beach on 
weekends, and on Sunday Welz would sit patiently in the back of the church. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a real steady portion of my life," Bell said. "I've told a lot of 
things to him I wouldn't tell another human being. . . . Who knows? Maybe I'll 
try to sneak him into the office." 
</P>

FLORIDIANS TELL ROHRABACHER TO MIND HIS OWN BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A foray into Florida politics by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) has ruffled 
the feathers of Sunshine State Republicans, who have advised their California 
colleague to mind his own business. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher piqued the Floridians by leading an endorsement drive in Congress 
for a conservative Cuban-American businessman, Carlos Perez, in an Aug. 1 
primary. Perez was associated with the Reagan Administration, which Rohrabacher 
served in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida primary will pick the GOP standard-bearer in a special election to 
fill the Miami-area House seat left vacant by the death in May of Rep. Claude 
D. Pepper, a liberal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refrained on Purpose 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to House Republicans, all 10 of Florida's GOP congressmen said they 
had purposely refrained from endorsing any candidate in the hotly contested 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
"We have now been placed in the untenable position of remaining silent while 
other members, from outside the state, and not being conversant with the local 
political situation, have allowed their names to be associated with one of the 
Republican candidates," the Florida congressmen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"The Florida delegation would greatly appreciate no further interference by 
outsiders in this Republican primary," the letter concluded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approach 'Derailed' 
</P>
<P>
Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Fort Lauderdale, who wrote the letter, said Tuesday: 
"We had decided probably the best thing to do was let that particular race run 
its course. . . . Our whole approach was somewhat derailed, or at least got off 
on a bumpy track, when we found out Mr. Rohrabacher had spearheaded an effort 
to get congressional endorsements" for Perez. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher persuaded 12 congressmen to endorse Perez. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said he is simply standing up for an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's standard operating procedure that when somebody has a friend, or 
an ideological soul mate, running someplace for Congress, that they help them 
out," said Rohrabacher, who was a speech writer in the Reagan White House. "I 
had no idea that it would cause anybody any problem anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Close Race 
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for the support of members of Congress outside of California, 
Rohrabacher said, he might not have won his first congressional race in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, a millionaire fruit importer, arrived in the United States nearly 30 
years ago as an impoverished immigrant fleeing Fidel Castro's revolution in 
Cuba. He was once mentioned by President Reagan in a State of the Union address 
as an example of the success that immigrants can achieve. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1984 presidential race, Perez headed a Latino-oriented campaign 
organization called Viva Reagan. He is also chairman of the Concerned Citizens 
for Democracy, organized in 1987 to raise money for medical treatment for 
anti-government forces in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
In the Republican primary in Florida's 18th Congressional District, Perez is 
challenging front-runner Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida state senator who is 
also a Cuban-American and a political conservative.

SANTA CLARITA COUNCIL VOTES TO HIRE LOBBYIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council, saying it wants to build up the young city's 
political muscle, has hired a lobbyist to represent the city in Los Angeles, 
Sacramento and -- if need be -- Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed Tuesday night to retain Capital Representation Group, a 
Sacramento-based firm, for $5,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first issues the lobbyists will tackle will be proposals by a refuse 
firm and the city and county of Los Angeles to open a dump in Elsmere Canyon, 
two miles east of Santa Clarita.

RESIDENTS ANGRY AS AIRPORT ADDS A FLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD OF FEDERAL EXPRESS TALKS, NEIGHBORS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Some neighbors of Burbank Airport are angry that the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena 
Airport Authority has granted Federal Express permission to operate one flight 
per day from the airport beginning Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Paterson of the Valley Village Homeowners Assn. in North Hollywood said the 
public should have been made aware of negotiations between the airport and 
Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been kept very quiet," Paterson said of the negotiations, adding that 
Federal Express "could have been kept out if there been public discussion about 
this from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Federal Express' application to fly from the airport was unanimously approved 
by the authority on Monday. Company officials said that beginning Aug. 7 the 
carrier will dispatch a Boeing 727 each weeknight at 7 p.m. from Burbank to 
Memphis, Tenn., where packages handled by the carrier are sorted and forwarded. 
</P>
<P>
The airport handles a daily average of 65 jetliner departures. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials acknowledged that they had been negotiating with Federal 
Express for more than a year, but said they had no legal obligation to inform 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not operating in some park," said Thomas Greer, director of Airport 
Services. "This is part of the national air transportation system. If Federal 
Express complies with the noise rules instituted by the authority, there's no 
way the authority can keep them out." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, who is on the airport board, said 
she was unconcerned by one daily flight by Federal Express, as long as the 
package carrier does not add more. 
</P>
<P>
Paterson said he plans to send a letter to Federal Express officials inviting 
them to meet with area homeowners next week to discuss flight patterns, 
aircraft safety and future plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to find out what they're up to, what their long-term plans are for 
Burbank," Paterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Close of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. said his group also would 
like to meet with Federal Express officials. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time there's no way we can keep them out," Close said. "We 
don't have the power to keep them out. We just want to work with them to be 
good neighbors because the fact is, every new airline at the airport creates 
new problems and safety risks." 
</P>
<P>
Federal Express officials declined to comment on whether they would meet with 
the homeowners. "We've been approved by the airport authority, and that's about 
all we can say," said Armand Schneider, corporate spokesman for Federal 
Express.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH SURRENDERS AFTER 4-HOUR STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teen-ager with a loaded handgun barricaded himself in a Canoga Park house for 
four hours Thursday before surrendering when Los Angeles police fired four 
tear-gas canisters inside, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager, who was not identified because of his age, was arrested on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon after the incident in the 21000 block 
of Valerio Street, said Police Lt. George Rock. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who was on home probation following a burglary conviction four 
months ago, allegedly was under the influence of cocaine and armed himself with 
a handgun at 11:40 a.m., Rock said. When his older brother tried to take the 
gun away, the suspect assaulted him and chased him out of the house at 
gunpoint, Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called and nearby homes were evacuated. The gunman, a Mexican 
national, refused to comply with orders -- in Spanish and English -- to 
surrender and the standoff continued until 3:30 p.m. when members of the 
Special Weapons and Tactics unit fired tear gas into the house. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager then came out of the house with his hands behind his head, but 
still holding the handgun. After repeated orders to drop the weapon, he 
complied and was arrested. Rock said he would be turned over to juvenile 
authorities following the investigation.

Wynn's International Inc. reported a 42% increase in net income for the second 
quarter, to $1.7 million from $1.2 million for the like quarter last year. 
Sales decreased 13%, to $70.5 million from $80.6 million. The company 
attributed the decline to significantly lower sales at its automotive 
air-conditioning subsidiary, due to the nationwide drop in new car and truck 
sales. Net income for the first six months totaled $4.9 million, which included 
a gain of $1.4 million from the sale of the company's interest in a joint 
venture. For the first half of 1988, net income was $990,000, which included a 
charge of $1 million for costs associated with management changes and 
termination of the company's Supplemental Retirement Plan. Net sales for the 
first six months of 1989 dropped 5%, to $143.6 million from $150.8 million for 
the comparable 1988 period. Wynn's, headquartered in Fullerton, is a supplier 
of automotive air conditioners, O-rings, seals, molded rubber products, 
petrochemical specialties products and builders hardware.

The Hammond Co., a Newport Beach mortgage banking firm, posted a net loss of 
$513,000 for its fiscal first quarter, ended June 30, more than double the 
$243,000 loss reported in the same quarter last year. Quarterly revenue fell 
10% to $4.5 million this year from $5 million last year. Thomas T. Hammond, the 
company's president, attributed the quarterly loss to reduced sales of 
loan-servicing rights. He said the company expects to recoup the loss and turn 
a profit in the second quarter. Hammond directors also elected William P. Foley 
II as a director, expanding the board to eight members. Foley is chairman of 
Fidelity National Financial Inc. in Irvine, which bought a 16.3% stake in 
Hammond last month. That stake grew to 20% after the company completed a tender 
offer to retire one-fifth of its shares.

David Mamet's "Speed-the-Plow" will have its Southern California premiere next 
season at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, running June 8 to July 15 on the 
Mainstage. The three-character play originated at New York's Lincoln Center and 
ran on Broadway last year with Joe Mantegna and Ron Silver as a couple of 
sleazy movie producers and Madonna in her stage debut as an office temp. "Since 
it's set in Hollywood, I'm a little surprised that we're the first theater on 
the West Coast to get the play," South Coast artistic director Martin Benson 
said Thursday. "If I were running a theater in Los Angeles, I would have been 
all over it. It's delicious, delightful and bitchy -- everything that makes 
good, trenchant theater." ALEENE MacMINN

A BARRAGE OF ONE-LINERS IN 'TROLLOPE'

<TEXT>
<P>
Did Paul Revere invent Revereware? Did his wife ever wish she had married Mr. 
Tupper instead? If the 1812 Overture had been written in 1774, would it have 
been futuristic? 
</P>
<P>
Fractured footnotes, puns and jocular jibes. That's all you get from "The 
Scandalous Adventures of Sir Toby Trollope," at San Diego Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one expects too much from Low Moan Spectacular, the crackerjack team of 
Ron House and Alan Shearman that brought us "El Grande de Coca Cola" and 
"Bullshot Crummond." 
</P>
<P>
But after the smoke of one-liners, consummately delivered, has cleared, one is 
left wondering what was that masked play that streaked across the stage in 
three -- yes, three -- hours and two intermissions. The uncomfortable feeling 
is that dessert would be much improved with a main course. 
</P>
<P>
The plot, such as it is, takes Sir Toby Trollope, a low-life confidence man in 
1774, and sets him on a journey to gain his fortune by marrying off his 
half-wit son, Bartholomew, to Fanny, an impressionable young woman of wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Fanny, who relies on the advice of her lascivious aunt and an imaginary friend, 
comes from a family of Tories. Trollope, whose plans inevitably backfire, flees 
after offending the father, and falls into the hands of Revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
He ends up in the cross fire without a point of view other than a desire to 
make a buck. And, sadly for the play, a point of view is something he never 
obtains -- at least not convincingly. It's almost as if the British and 
American team of House and Shearman canceled out whatever positions they might 
have on the American Revolution. And without a sense of underlying humanity to 
flesh out the roles, the jokes have little resonance or force. 
</P>
<P>
The actors -- marvelous all -- play a variety of parts, although most excel at 
one. Rodger Bumpass steals the show as the priggish Jonathan Pitcairn 
(Bartholomew's mewlish rival for Fanny's hand) and the henpecked Paul Revere 
(who has one of the best comic bits as the fast-talking pots and pans salesman, 
throwing in a Minuteman Knife free if you act now to place your special order). 
</P>
<P>
House and Shearman provide a solid backbone to this horseplay with their 
portrayals of Trollope (House) and Bartholomew (Shearman). They offer 
everything comedically, except heart. Melinda Peterson alone manages to blend 
in poignancy with irresistibly vivacious comic delivery as the hapless Fanny. 
Ron Vernan flusters and blusters with feeling as Gov. Percival Pettifogg-Leafe, 
the man who runs to France to escape Colonial unrest because, after all, 
"revolution is so declasse there." 
</P>
<P>
Anna Mathias is nothing less than delicious as the amply endowed aunt with the 
wandering hands. William Dennis Hunt is at his prickly best as Fanny's 
bloodthirsty father, who is positively let down when a foe dies before he has a 
chance to personally liberate his blood from his body. 
</P>
<P>
Under Steven Rothman's direction, the best moments come when the ensemble uses 
synchronized motion on the handsome, versatile Colonial set by Fred M. Duer and 
Alan K. Okazaki. Bouncing together on a deftly arranged pile of boxes, they 
convey everything from a swaying ship to a racing carriage. Then, just below 
the main stage, a spread of blue sheets part for a man to fall in and later be 
rescued at sea. 
</P>
<P>
The lighting by John B. Forbes enhances each effect. In David Kay Mickelsen's 
elaborately comic costumes, male preening matches female preening bow to bow, 
powder to powder and wig to wig. 
</P>
<P>
But the sound design by Jon Gottlieb sometimes gets ahead of itself. Discordant 
music pipes in between scenes, before the narration explains that Bartholomew 
writes horrible music -- which, in essence, puts punch line before setup. 
Still, the confusion is minor considering that hardly anyone in this play, 
beyond Toby, has much of a reason for doing anything. 
</P>
<P>
This paucity of purpose ultimately leaves "The Scandalous Adventures of Sir 
Toby Trollope" as nothing more revealing than Ron and Alan's excellent 
adventure. It's about as subtle as a kick to the groin -- of which there is no 
shortage. And while their tale of the American Revolution gets laughs, that's 
all it gets. 
</P>
<P>
As they say in the play, start this revolution without me. 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Diego Repertory Theatre, Horton Plaza, in San Diego, Tuesdays 
through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m., with matinees Saturdays and Sundays 
at 2. Ends Aug. 19. Tickets: $14-$22; (619) 235-8025.

BARRY DOUGLAS IN HOLLYWOOD BOWL RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barry Douglas is a slippery one. After hearing the prize-winning Irish pianist 
four times in the past year, one still has difficulty getting a clear picture 
of what kind of musician he is. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, Douglas' second local recital, this time outdoors at Hollywood 
Bowl, also failed to bring the 29-year-old pianist into focus. 
</P>
<P>
He is without doubt a thoroughly equipped virtuoso. He has power, speed, 
accuracy, a palette of pianistic colors and varieties of touch -- more, perhaps 
than a number of other recent winners of international competitions. And his 
technical resources, coupled with an emerging temperament, make him an 
articulate performer. 
</P>
<P>
His musical tastes apparently run to the eclectic -- but with greater depth 
than one might expect from one of his particular generation, a generation known 
for its shallow versatility. 
</P>
<P>
In moments, Douglas shows the promise of great beginnings. He did so last 
September, when, on one of the hottest, dryest nights of the year, he played 
Tchaikovsky's First Concerto with the Pittsburgh Symphony in Cahuenga Pass. He 
achieved a similar impression at his indoor recital at the South Bay Center for 
the Arts in March. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, before 7,625 listeners sharing a cool evening at the Bowl, he gave a 
mixed performance, one which alternated impassioned moments with indifferent 
ones, probing musicality with dutiful water-treading. It was confusing. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest confusion may not have been Douglas' fault. It came in 
Tchaikovsky's massive, but justifiably neglected, Sonata in G, a work of 
dubious value and limited appeal through which he sailed admirably, but 
apparently without being able to manage to add to its mostly nonexistent 
charms. 
</P>
<P>
Like comparable piano sonatas by Grieg and MacDowell, this is a minor work by 
an important composer, a work to be heard once, to satisfy one's curiosity. 
Douglas played it with relish, and surmounted all its obstacles. But he could 
not rescue it from its own, built-in aridity. 
</P>
<P>
Chopin's F-minor Ballade, the one holdover from the pianist's March program, 
emerged this time highly convincing, well-shaped, passionate of statement. One 
suspects Douglas is a Chopin player, above all: He has the poetic instincts, 
the command of detail and, most important, the heroic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
If one had not heard Alexander Slobodyanik produce an awesome, virtually 
definitive, live reading of the original piano version of Mussorgsky's 
"Pictures at an Exhibition" last October at Ambassador Auditorium, Douglas' 
admirable, highly colored and compelling performance on Wednesday might have 
restored our faith in that overfamiliar and hackneyed work. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Douglas made it more attractive and kaleidoscopic than most other 
pianists. For that, one had to be grateful. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the loud approbation of his Bowl audience, Douglas played one 
encore: Schumann's "Traumerei."

STRAWBERRY CREEK FESTIVAL OFFERS PREVIEW CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A warm-up concert Wednesday for the Strawberry Creek Festival -- which 
officially begins Sunday evening at Pepperdine University -- appropriately 
showed off the expertise of many of the festival's spotlighted participants. 
Although the three chamber works presented at the Schoenberg Institute at USC 
served largely as an appetizer, at least one performance hit a bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Hindemith's Quartet for clarinet, violin, cello and piano deftly 
blended several varied performance styles among the players, producing a 
remarkably satisfying result. The sophisticated, intricate writing sang out 
with a warmth and rapture that unflaggingly measured every moment. 
</P>
<P>
Clarinetist Mitchell Lurie and violinist Eudice Shapiro provided tireless, 
meticulously calculated playing. Pianist Val Underwood's diligent approach 
carefully crafted the undulating, precise passages. Peter Rejto's work on cello 
pleasingly applied expressivity more passionate and wrenching than his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
A lighter undertaking for oboe, viola and piano, Two Rhapsodies by Charles 
Loeffler, represented the evening's only example of gushy Romanticism. Again, 
the careful work of Underwood fueled a performance that aggressively examined 
all aspects of the flowery music. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard Reuter supplied not only overflowing melodies on the oboe accompanied by 
heavy body-swaying, but an unintentionally comic reading of the poem that 
inspired Loeffler's piece. As it turned out, the music has very little to do 
with the grotesque images of death and ugliness in the poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the program was a dutiful performance of Schoenberg's "Ein 
Stelldichein," a short fragment for oboe, clarinet, violin, cello and piano. 
The static, pre-Expressionist study found few moments of virtuosity, although 
the presentation proceeded intelligently and without noticeable flaw. GREGG

Evergon is a Canadian photographer who goes by a single name and conceives of 
his work as "homo-baroque" in style. Mockingly theatrical, his large-format 
Polaroids poke into various corners of art history. 
</P>
<P>
"Jacob Wrestling With the Angel" borrows from Caravaggio's sharply lit, 
teasingly homo-erotic figures who are pushed smack up against the 
picture-plane. The "angel," a guy in a white headband trimmed with baby's 
breath, pokes his head over the torso of nude Jacob -- who writhes as if caught 
up in a particularly steamy dream -- and contrives to hold his hand. One 
translucent wing brushes Jacob's thigh, slyly in keeping with the biblical 
image in which the angel "touched the hollow of (Jacob's) thigh." 
</P>
<P>
Two small, gauze-wrapped boys with crumpled tinfoil at their feet pose in 
"Cupid," a diptych. One child holds a big album, the other balances a globe. 
This set piece seems evocative of the sentimental sort of Victorian photography 
that predated the Photo-Secessionists. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Evergon's figurative work seems cleverer than his still lifes. 
The most subtly insidious of these is probably "Squash," a close-up view of the 
cut-open fruit resting on a white tablecloth, contains a fleeting memory of the 
17th-Century still life masters as well as a voluptuous delight in the fruit's 
interior tangle of seeds and membranes. Dangling dried chilis on the wall add a 
lascivious, quirkily South-of-the-border touch. (Glenn/Dash Gallery, 962 N. La 
Brea Ave., to Aug. 26.) CATHY CURTIS

In 1903, when photography was still knocking timidly on the imposing front door 
of art, Alfred Stieglitz began publishing Camera Work. In its 14-year lifespan, 
the quarterly magazine would make a big case for the aesthetic possibilities of 
the medium, aided by the most scrupulous printing methods available and 
far-ranging essays on art and photography. 
</P>
<P>
The images in the journal, displayed individually in this exhibit, are 
hand-pulled photogravures usually made from the original negatives and printed 
on Japanese tissue to retain the delicate gradation of tone. Robert Demachy -- 
whose 1904 photograph, "Speed," shows a roadster disappearing down a soft gray 
road lined with trees -- noted wryly that "For the initiated or perhaps for the 
insane . . . there is a most exquisite pleasure in the contemplation of fine 
shades" of black "independently of form." 
</P>
<P>
Form in the works on view generally takes on a dreamy aura, bearing out the 
Photo-Secession group's belief that a photograph ought to possess the evident 
artistry of a painting rather than utilitarian sharp focus. (Stieglitz's views 
on this matter changed radically by 1917, when he was a champion of "straight" 
photography, but the show emphasizes Camera Work's early years.) 
</P>
<P>
Karl Struss' "The Landing Place" peers down at a gentle summer scene: a 
graceful stone balustrade and shady tree overlooking a lake with a lazy rowboat 
and barge. In "Ploughing," Stieglitz finds a glorious palette of grays in the 
sky above a farmer and the black and white flanks of his horses. Theodore 
Hofmeister's "Dachau" brings today's viewer up short with a placid view of 
white houses and tall trees. (The photograph predates by 29 years the 
concentration camp established on the outskirts of this picturesque German 
town.) 
</P>

Along with nature, young women were favorite subjects. Stieglitz's "Miss S.R." 
introduces a moodily attractive femme fatale in a pert hat. As an emblem of 
"Spring," he choose a toddler in a bonnet and flaring coat, planted in profile 
on the grassy meadow like a giant flower. In George H. Seeley's "The White 
Screen," a slender woman in a long gown and flowing shoulder wrap is bathed in 
light-dappled shadow.

Other Camera Work photographers whose work is sampled here include Baron Adolf 
de Meyer, a specialist in luminous portraits and still lifes, and the 
mid-19th-Century duo of David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson, revered by 
members of Photo-Secession as early masters of the photographic portrait.

A timely -- if unrelated -- centerpiece for a group exhibit of work by young 
Los Angeles artists is a stained and faded flag. In 1965, an otherwise obscure 
artist named Marc Morrel tied the flag into the squat shape of a bolster to 
protest the Vietnam War in 1965. The following year, when the piece was 
exhibited in a New York gallery, dealer Stephen Radich was convicted of 
violating the city's flag desecration statute. After a prolonged court fight, 
the conviction was finally reversed in 1974 by a federal district court. 
</P>
<P>
The newsworthiness of Morrel's piece, of course, lies in the recent hullabaloo 
over presumed flag desecration -- outraged responses to the recent Supreme 
Court decision on flag burning and to a flag piece displayed earlier this year 
at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. But distanced from the era that 
inspired it and separated from the rhetoric that swirled around it, the bundled 
flag itself seems a calm and sober piece. A quiet little parcel, it suggests 
repression and constraint -- a national symbol made musclebound and dumb and 
humble. 
</P>
<P>
Of the other 13 artists in "Fresh Art from Hollywood," the most familiar name 
is that of Judy Fiskin, whose tiny black-and-white photographs offer crisp 
glimpses of the quietly distinctive personalities of Southern California homes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most distinctive pieces in the show is "Posing Threats," Kevin 
Miller's large painting of three silhouetted soldiers in uniforms of different 
vintages. Although the doughboy's rifle is easy to make out, it's anyone's 
guess as to what objects the other two are holding, and perhaps that mystery 
(suggesting the ultra-specialized aspects of modern-day warfare) lies at the 
heart of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Painter Judy Kameon looks afresh at a number of familiar objects, most 
rewardingly in "Large Honeycomb," in which the irregularities of the artist's 
touch and the brushy color deliberately fight the serial rigor of the magnified 
grid pattern. 
</P>
<P>
James Trivers' down-home canvases are filled chock-a-block with little 
vignettes (key moments from the life of Elvis Presley in "Elvis, What 
Happened?") and overlaid with big images that pop out when viewed with 3-D 
glasses. Nicholette Kominos' pale paintings with odd bobbing shapes are most 
appealing when regular patterns of texture and quirky form unite, as in 
"Periods of Water No. 3." 
</P>
<P>
Of Lauri Sing's mixed-media works, the most ambitious is "Boots, wood plank, 
cup and two figures," in which blocks of color, a real wood plank and objects 
rendered as if in imitation of print techniques suggest a puzzling yet oddly 
intense form of rebus. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Wheeler offers several enigmatic wall pieces, the most formally 
satisfying of which is "Utterance (III)," a tall plaque with a thermometer-like 
slit, attached to a low-slung vessel containing a wax deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists with work in the show are Paul Knotter, Chris Wilder, Peter 
Zecher, Kevin Miller, Darcy Huebler and Tomas . G. Henry III. (Newspace, 5241

Stephen Westfall, New York art critic, author and artist, has curated a show of 
New York sculpture called "The Milky Way." Gallery literature says, "this name 
conjures qualities of luminosity, cosmology, eroticism, delicacy and good 
humor." The idea is that these sculptures occupy that limbo land preserved for 
the Surrealist object: things of this world but not quite in the world. The 
artists appropriate or manipulate the everyday, jostling traditional 
associations and contexts so that objects become something new, strange and, in 
those works that hit their mark, intensely provocative. 
</P>
<P>
Timed to coincide with "The Dada and Surrealist Word-Image" at the County 
Museum of Art, Westfall's show implies a connective link between Dada 
progenitors and contemporary Surrealism. Sick of war's brutality, Dada's 
currency was the irrational, absurd and anarchistic. Later Surrealists cast off 
social and political aspects of Dada, fixing on the absence of reason in the 
subconscious where sex, mystery, violence and personal poetry prevail. The 
works in "Milky Way" mix and match both traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Duchampian spoofs nuanced with commentary about the foibles of the real world 
and the art world can be found in Lindsay Walt's wall-bound spinoffs of mute 
domestic bric-a-brac, in James Thomas' industrial metal gizmos with no function 
whatsoever, in Dan Devine's concrete slabs with machine parts embedded in them. 
Andrew Masullo's glass boxes holding old photos and loose metal letters invite 
you to pick them up, shake them like children's toys, and a final small group 
pulls in the lyrical side of Surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Shaver assembles an aged found picture frame beside a statuette of a bird 
and nothing happens, while Bill Barrette's sensual, remarkably allusive 
construction and Patrice Caire's strange cast objects all but carry the show 
with their resonant readings. (Shoshana Wayne Gallery, 1454 5th St., to Sept.

Administrators at what Playboy magazine once labeled the nation's top party 
college are considering policies aimed at reducing students' alcohol intake. If 
the new policies take effect at 16,000-student Cal State Chico this fall, there 
no longer will be beer company-sponsored keg rolls for charity, advertisements 
for alcohol in the student newspaper or drinking mugs in the bookstore. 
University President Robin Wilson suggests that such actions would "meliorate 
the effects of Chico State's sad reputation as a bibulous institution." He was 
referring to publicity about a riot by drunken students at the university's 
annual Pioneer Days celebration in the spring of 1987, which was preceded by 
Playboy's designation of CSUC as the nation's top party school. Wilson, a 
former CIA agent, later canceled further celebrations of Pioneer Days in the 
interest of improving the university's tarnished reputation.

The beleaguered tanker Exxon Valdez will probably be towed into San Diego Bay 
for repairs on Sunday after tests are made to determine whether the ship is 
leaking any more significant amounts of oily discharges. The Exxon Shipping Co. 
and the state of California have agreed that the ship cannot leak any more 
before entering the harbor, but the state has said it will be "reasonable" 
about leakage and the Coast Guard has said it will permit any discharge that 
can be contained by cleanup equipment surrounding the ship. Oily discharges 
have come sporadically from the ship's hull since it was towed here from Alaska 
after a collision with a reef that dumped 11 million gallons of oil along a 
once pristine shoreline.

A dissident South Korean student trying to return from an unauthorized visit to 
North Korea was turned back after marching to the border. Im Su Kyong, 20, and 
a dissident South Korean priest led about 500 others in a rally in the truce 
village of Panmunjom, about 35 miles north of Seoul, demanding that the 
marchers be allowed to cross the border. The village is in the demilitarized 
zone separating the two nations. Im and her group of peace marchers finally 
turned back and marched north, with Im saying she would not cross the border 
unless she is met by relatives and friends, officials said.

Canadians began returning home to salvage what remains from fires that 
destroyed 3.7 million acres of forest in three central provinces. Some 
roadblocks in Manitoba were lifted, and a group from the Cross Lake Indian 
Reserve returned to their homes a few hours later. They were among the 27,000 
people forced from their homes by the fires in northern Manitoba, Saskatchewan 
and Ontario. No injuries or deaths were reported. Scattered rain and cooler 
temperatures helped bring some fires under control, but hundreds of others were 
still burning.

An Israeli commando unit swept into a Lebanese village by helicopter during the 
night and captured a leader of the radical Hezbollah militia and two of his 
relatives and flew them to Israel, Israel Radio reported. It said the elite 
unit broke into the house of Sheik Abdel Kareem Obeid in the village of 
Jibshit, about 20 miles north of the Israeli border. The report said the 
commandos, armed with silencer-equipped pistols, killed one of Obeid's 
bodyguards and tied up the sheik's wife. Obeid, his nephew and another relative 
then reportedly were taken to the helicopter and flown to Israel. Hezbollah, or 
Party of God, seeks an Iranian-style Islamic republic in Lebanon.

The Senate Judiciary Committee postponed until next week a vote on whether 
William Lucas should head the Justice Department's civil rights agency so that 
a key member, Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), could study new material. Heflin, 
considered a pivotal vote, did not say what the new material was, and committee 
workers involved with the nomination declined to comment. Republican members 
tried to force a vote so that the nomination could be brought to the full 
Senate before Congress' Aug. 5 recess but Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), 
chairman of the committee, rescheduled a vote for Tuesday. Lucas, 61, has met 
opposition from some civil rights groups and liberal lawmakers who question his 
qualifications and his knowledge of recent Supreme Court decisions they 
consider anti-civil rights.

PICKFAIR; 
</P>
<P>
FAMED HOLLYWOOD MANSION WILL GET AN ITALIAN LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Pickfair, that most glamorous of Beverly Hills movieland estates, is about to 
be transformed into a Renaissance-style Venetian palazzo by its celebrity 
owners, Pia Zadora and her multimillionaire husband, Meshulam Riklis. 
</P>
<P>
The name will stay the same, but little else apparently will. 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to mind, however, that the famed estate of Douglas Fairbanks and 
Mary Pickford will hardly be recognizable once the couple has finished with 
planned renovations costing upwards of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Beverly Hills Planning Commission officials who gave preliminary 
approval to the plans Wednesday night said no one raised objections to the 
project. Pickfair, everyone seems to agree, took its fame from its owners, not 
their architects. 
</P>
<P>
"The house has been changed through the years a number of times so that it no 
longer is the original Pickfair," said Paul Selwyn, chairman of the Planning 
Commission. "It's going to be made into much more of a special kind of 
property." 
</P>
<P>
Vacant for the last two years, Pickfair had become dusty and run down. Zadora 
and her husband, who have at least four other residences, bought it last year 
for $6.675 million from Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss. 
</P>
<P>
Plans presented to the Planning Commission called for extensive exterior and 
interior renovation that would add approximately 2,754 square feet to the 
existing 13,421 square-foot structure. There will also be a formal terraced 
garden, fountains and reflecting pools, a dog run and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
Winston Millet, past president of the Beverly Hills Historical Society, said he 
saw no reason to object to the changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Pickfair was a product of the p.r. firms of Hollywood," he said. Even the 
name, which evokes images of beautiful people playing croquet on the rolling 
lawn, was the invention of the popular press. 
</P>
<P>
"The grounds are kind of fun because of the name, but otherwise it's nothing 
spectacular," Millet said. "It's just a house. And it wasn't a spectacular 
house to begin with. I'm sorry it doesn't give you the angle that we're angry 
about it, but we're not," he told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Zadora was not available for comment. She is busy at the Disney studios making 
"The Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme," a TV movie in which she plays the part of 
Little Miss Muffet. 
</P>
<P>
But Tino Barzie, her manager, said that the Riklises plan to hold onto 
Pickfair, poised atop a knoll on a three-acre site near the corner of Summit 
Drive and Pickfair Way. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is expected to last two years, but the Riklises and their two 
young children, have several other residences to stay at in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
They are now living at a home in the Truesdale section of Beverly Hills, but 
they also have a beach house in Malibu, an apartment in New York and a 
penthouse at the Riviera, their hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows yet just how many rooms the new Pickfair will contain, although a 
decorator for a previous owner estimated the estate had space for anywhere from 
25 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New Face 
</P>
<P>
The redone mansion will have tile roofs, leaded windows, balconies, verandas 
and a new, Italian-style front entrance, made up of two tiers of flanking 
stairs ascending from a driveway at the eastern end of the property. 
</P>
<P>
And it will be private. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't be able to see the house much," Barzie said. "She's in show business 
and he's a successful businessman, but they're quiet kind of people. There's 
not going to be a neon sign saying 'Pia and Rick live here."' 
</P>
<P>
The name will not be changed, according to Riklis. He sent word through a 
secretary that "Pickfair will be called Pickfair." 
</P>
<P>
Built as a six-room hunting lodge in 1910, the estate came into the public eye 
when Douglas Fairbanks bought it for $35,000 in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
The dashing star of early motion pictures soon married Mary Pickford, the most 
famous actress of the day and they lived together in their house on the hill. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first of the showplace movie star estates, where actors and 
actresses could be themselves and entertain their friends, safe from the prying 
eyes of unwanted fans. Yet Pickfair was also a stage set where Doug and Mary 
acted out their well-publicized private-life roles for millions of their fans," 
wrote Charles Lockwood and Jeffrey Hyland in their book, "The Estates of 
Beverly Hills," republished this year. 
</P>
<P>
The guests were as famous as their hosts. Charlie Chaplin lived next door and 
often came over for dinner and a movie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Famous Guests 
</P>
<P>
So did Lilian Gish, Pickford's friend from childhood, and Jack Dempsey, Albert 
Einstein, Amelia Earhart, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry Ford, Babe Ruth and H.G. 
Wells. 
</P>
<P>
The hunting lodge had grown over the years, but the additions did little for 
the looks of the place, and Fairbanks and Pickford called in Wallace Neff, a 
prominent architect. 
</P>
<P>
"Neff recounted in later years that he urged the famous couple to pull the 
building down and start all over again, but they did not go along with this 
idea. The residence was transformed as much as possible into an English 
Regencyhouse," according to "Wallace Neff, Architect of California's Golden 
Age," a study edited by Neff's son, Wallace Jr. 
</P>
<P>
This was in 1932, but Fairbanks did not stay long long to enjoy the new look. 
</P>
<P>
The couple divorced in 1936, and Pickford stayed on at Pickfair with Buddy 
Rogers, the singer and actor who was her third husband, until her death at age 
76 in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pickford became a recluse in later years, Rogers frequently hosted 
charity events at the mansion. So did the next owner, sports mogul Buss, who 
bought Pickfair for $5.4 million in 1980.

BUCKEY DENIES ALL 53 CHARGES AGAINST HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Buckey, the key defendant in the McMartin Pre-School trial, denied Thursday 
each of 53 separate allegations of molestation and conspiracy against him, 
completing in two days of testimony his rebuttal of accusations that have hung 
over him for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Briskly led by his attorney through the lengthy and often graphic charges, 
involving 11 children who attended his family's Manhattan Beach nursery school, 
the 31-year-old Buckey remained composed, confident, and terse, often giving 
one-word answers to long questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing improper ever happened at the preschool," he said adamantly at one 
point, raising his voice, as defense lawyer Danny Davis recited each count of 
rape, sodomy, oral copulation, and other criminal acts described by nine of 11 
of Buckey's alleged victims, asking each time, "Did you do that?" 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said it wants to hear more. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Buckey was very carefully led by his lawyer to answer simple questions 
with 'yes' and 'no,' " said Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin, after court recessed 
for the day. "It's going to take a long time to explain the real bases for his 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey insisted that he was never even present at the nursery school when many 
of his accusers attended and that he never touched youngsters in his care in 
any manner that could be misconstrued as sexual. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he wore shorts without underwear, as prosecution testimony has 
indicated, but said he never intentionally exposed himself to children. He said 
that after a mother of a girl on a soccer team he helped coach complained about 
his genitals being visible in short shorts, he began wearing sweats during 
warm-up exercises. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't worn underwear for years," he explained. "It was a habit I picked up 
living at the beach playing volleyball." Denying any sexual penchant for 
children or "kiddie porn," Buckey acknowledged that he used adult pornography 
for sexual gratification. The pornography issue surfaced when Davis showed 
Buckey a collection of sexually explicit photographs seized during a search of 
his parents' home five years ago. Buckey admitted trying to flush the pictures 
down the toilet, and said he threw some out a window. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secretly Stored 
</P>
<P>
He said he had secretly stored them under his dresser and the mattress of his 
bed. Buckey said he had tried to dispose of them, both on the advice of his 
attorney and because he believed the Manhattan Beach police detective 
investigating the case would "make a big issue of my having adult pornography." 
</P>
<P>
"She'd (already) made a big thing about my having a Playboy magazine," he said. 
"I didn't think she needed any help in fabricating a case against me."

<P>
Buckey testified that during a two-day period in 1984 he shared a cell at Men's 
Central Jail with convicted felon and informant George Freeman. The pair talked 
for several hours after lights out, Buckey testified, but answered "no" when 
his lawyer asked whether he had discussed with Freeman "anything about your own 
sexual activities." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, a self-admitted perjurer, testified earlier that Buckey admitted that 
he had sodomized a 2 1/2-year-old boy whose allegations sparked the 
investigation that led to his arrest, and described other perverted sexual 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's co-defendant in the case is his 62-year-old mother, Peggy McMartin 
Buckey, who ran the school. She already has testified, denying all counts 
against her. Five others associated with the school initially had been 
implicated, but the district attorney, citing weak evidence, declined to 
prosecute. But the bulk of the children's allegations centered on Ray Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regular Duties 
</P>
<P>
The lanky, tanned defendant said he began working regularly at his mother's 
school in January, 1981, after several months of observing on Fridays and 
Mondays while still enrolled at San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like a time I thought I'd like to be a preschool teacher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't you see something wrong with being a male working a preschool?" Davis 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"A male? No, not at all," Buckey replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Couldn't you have gotten a better job?" Davis pressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Better how?" Buckey countered. 
</P>
<P>
"More appropriate for a male," Davis suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything inappropriate for a male to be working with children." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's mother, in her testimony, described her son as a misfit who was always 
uncomfortable with his peers and adults, preferring the company of children. 
She said he was inexperienced and unable to control the class she eventually 
assigned him to, but that she felt he had potential. 
</P>
<P>
The tenor of most of Buckey's testimony under direct examination was 
straightforward and subdued.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRACKDOWN ON LOUD CAR STEREOS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council has voted unanimously to send a letter to the state 
Assembly endorsing a bill that would cite drivers who play car stereos too 
loudly. 
</P>
<P>
The decision follows a letter to the council from a group of residents near 
Torrance Beach who said they are annoyed almost daily by noisy car stereos. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman George Nakano had asked the city staff last week to study ways to 
regulate or cite drivers with "boom box" stereos. The staff recommended council 
support of a bill authored by Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) that 
would make it a violation of the state Vehicle Code to play a car stereo louder 
than 82 decibels. (Noise from a busy street may be rated 70 to 80 decibels.) 
</P>
<P>
Irene Ishizaka, an aide to Isenberg, said the bill is being held in committee 
because the decibel limit is difficult for police to enforce without a sound 
meter, and the bill leaves unclear what the penalty would be for a violation. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said the city is aware of the bill's problems but 
supports it in principle.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RTD UNION TO APPEAL FOOTHILL ZONE RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the 5,000-member union representing the Southern California 
Rapid Transit District drivers said the union will appeal last week's court 
decision allowing the Foothill Transit Zone to compete in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Transit, a partnership between 20 cities and the county, contracts 
with private bus companies to provide service. Unions representing RTD drivers 
and mechanics challenged the transit zone's creation, arguing that it 
threatened union jobs and was an illegal breakup of the RTD. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill was approved by the county Transportation Commission, which oversees 
county transportation policy, in late 1987 as a low-cost alternative to the 
RTD. Since December, it has operated express routes from Diamond Bar and 
Glendora to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Eli Chernow upheld Foothill 
Transit's continued operation, which includes taking over up to 20 of the RTD's 
San Gabriel Valley lines by mid-1990.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHEVRON FIRES 8 IN DRUG-USE PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A company investigation of drug use at the Chevron refinery in El Segundo has 
led to the termination of eight Chevron employees and 11 employees of a 
contractor being barred from working at the sprawling facility, a company 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Private investigators hired by the oil firm uncovered the use of small amounts 
of cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana, according to Chevron spokesman Rod 
Spackman. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we received this information, we felt it was important to act 
quickly and promptly. This all developed in the space of a couple of weeks," 
said Spackman. 
</P>
<P>
The Chevron employees, who had worked at the refinery from one to 13 years, 
were either maintenance or security personnel, he said. None of the workers, 
who were paid from $9.50 to $16 an hour, were supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was announced in a July 20 memorandum to all employees from 
Mike Holmes, general manager of the refinery.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH GIVES UP AFTER 4-HOUR STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teen-ager with a loaded handgun barricaded himself in a Canoga Park house for 
four hours Thursday before surrendering when Los Angeles police fired four tear 
gas canisters inside, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager, who was not identified because of his age, was arrested on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon after the incident in the 21000 block 
of Valerio Street, Police Lt. George Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who was on home probation after a burglary conviction four months 
ago, reportedly was under the influence of cocaine and armed himself with a 
handgun at 11:40 a.m., Rock said. When his older brother tried to take the gun 
away, the suspect assaulted him and chased him out of the house, Rock added. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called and nearby homes were evacuated. The standoff continued 
until 3:30 p.m., when members of the police Special Weapons and Tactics unit 
fired tear gas into the house. The teen-ager then surrendered.

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN FATAL STABBING OF TV COMPOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER and JOHN H. LEE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspect in the killing of a Hollywood composer was arrested in Riverside on 
Thursday, driving the dead man's car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Juanito Pascua Purugganan, 29, had been sought in the stabbing death of Doug 
Timm, whose body was found Wednesday at the bottom of a stairwell in his home 
in the 6900 block of Camrose Drive in the Hollywood Hills, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Timm, 29, a rising composer of themes for television series, was killed either 
Friday or Saturday, and his partially decomposed body was found by a security 
guard summoned by his landlady after she became concerned about him, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Purugganan's wife, Michelle, 20, also a suspect in the murder, and the couple's 
two young children were not with him when he was arrested at about 6 p.m., 
police said. Their whereabouts were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
An all-points bulletin had been issued for the couple after the discovery of 
Timm's body. 
</P>
<P>
"Riverside police were stopping the vehicle just as our detectives had called 
them to clear up a question on a Teletype," Los Angeles Police Lt. Ed Hocking 
said late Thursday. "Apparently several citizens had called in saying they had 
seen the vehicle. We have the car, the male suspect and a second male." 
</P>
<P>
Hocking said investigators had not determined the identity of the other man or 
if he played any role in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
The Purugganans had recently met Timm and with their children "were invited 
guests in Timm's residence," Hollywood Division Detective Rick Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
Police allege that the couple killed Timm "for the purpose of" robbery, the 
detective said. They took stereo equipment and Timm's black 1987 Toyota MR-2 
sports car, and fled with the children, a 2-year-old and a 10-month-old infant, 
according to Swanston. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors told police that Timm had run an advertisement to sell electronic 
equipment and speculated that whoever killed him had answered the ad with the 
intent to rob. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Remote Possibility' 
</P>
<P>
"But we haven't verified that," Swanston said. "We have heard that he did that 
in the past and people are assuming that that's what happened here. It is just 
a possibility; a remote possibility." 
</P>
<P>
The Purugganan family was last seen Monday in Riverside, Juanito Purugganan's 
hometown, detectives said. The family had returned to Southern California 
several months ago from Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Purugganan did not resist arrest, though relatives who live 
in the Long Beach area had told police that the suspect previously had 
threatened to kill himself or his children. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Chicago, Timm studied music and film composition at Boston's 
prestigious Berklee College of Music on a full scholarship, said his manager 
and longtime friend, Richard Emler. 
</P>
<P>
"He was friendly, open and a gentleman -- and I mean a gentleman, a classy 
young guy who was on the path to being very successful," Emler said. "This is a 
terrible loss, a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very diversified composer with a lot of styles and skills. He was 
young but very well-liked and well-respected." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Spiegel, a friend and neighbor, said Timm had built a studio in his home 
and spent most of his time working there. 
</P>
<P>
He said the composer, who was engaged to be married, was "easygoing, creative, 
outgoing, but not overly talkative -- a nice guy. Doug was a hard-working 
composer who was busy with his music and very successful." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just devastating, just senseless," said David Grossman, director of 
program music at Columbia Pictures Television. "On top of being talented, he 
was just a hell of a nice guy -- very easy to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman said he and Timm had worked together on several series, including 
"Designing Women" and "The New Mike Hammer." 
</P>
<P>
About an hour before he learned of the murder, Grossman said, he had put Timm's 
name up for a television "Movie of the Week" project. 
</P>
<P>
Timm was "very talented -- kind of an innocent for Hollywood," said his agent, 
Stan Milander. "He had movie star good looks and was very easy to work with. 
Producers and heads of music at the various studios have nothing but great 
things to say about him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great talent who people won't get to hear anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Timm's projects also included scores for such programs as "Dolphin Cove," and 
TV adaptations of "The Dirty Dozen" and "The Man Who Fell to Earth."

DEFORMED BOY WINS LAWSUIT; 
</P>
<P>
JURY AWARDS HIM $3.9 MILLION IN LEAD SPRAY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-year-old boy born with severe deformities has been awarded $3.9 million by 
a jury that found his problems were caused by lead spray from a manufacturing 
plant that contaminated his mother's home-grown vegetables in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The award handed down Wednesday will pay for lifetime medical bills and 
caretaking that Marcos Franco will need and will compensate him for his lost 
earnings, said his attorney, Roger L. Gordon, who called the award "fair and 
reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
"He can't take care of himself. . . . He'll never know the value of a dollar; 
he'll probably never work," Gordon said of Marcos, who now lives with his 
family in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos suffers from damage to his brain, nervous system and heart, Gordon said. 
He is deaf, blind in one eye and has to wear a back brace, the attorney added. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the defendant, O'Hommel Co. of Pittsburgh, said he will seek to 
have the verdict overturned. The suit in Santa Monica Superior Court was filed 
in 1984 against O'Hommel and Duraspan Inc., a now-defunct West Los Angeles 
mirror manufacturer that settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fuses to Glass 
</P>
<P>
O'Hommel Co. manufactures frit, an enamel-like substance containing lead that 
Duraspan used in its products. Sprayed onto glass, frit fuses to the glass and 
makes it opaque. The glass is then installed on the outside of office 
buildings, for instance, to cover up electric lines and tubing between floors, 
said Richard Foxx, O'Hommel's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Duraspan operated a plant on Carmelina Avenue until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, it was cited by city, county and state authorities for excess lead 
emissions and ordered to pay for a cleanup of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
It was then, when Marcos was 4, that his parents first became aware of the 
emissions and suspected that they might be to blame for their son's birth 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
"We put two and two together. . . . There was no other reason for it happening 
to me," Rosalie Franco, 35, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Duraspan later changed its spraying processes to contain the emissions, Gordon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Franco said that she, her husband, Salvador, and son, Anthony, moved into a 
house on Wellesley Avenue, one block from Duraspan, in 1977. After the move, 
she had two miscarriages before giving birth to Marcos. All the while, she 
said, she was eating tomatoes, zucchini and other vegetables from her back yard 
but did not suspect anything was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't notice anything. We just lived our everyday life," she said. "We 
didn't expect anything like that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Healthy Children 
</P>
<P>
After Marcos' birth, she was busy caring for the boy and "I just let (the 
garden) go," Franco said. She later gave birth to two healthy children. 
</P>
<P>
Duraspan settled the case before trial, Gordon said, agreeing to pay Marcos 
$2,000 a month, starting when he turns 18. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said he is not aware of any other cases in which a jury has found that 
"major congenital malformations" resulted from a mother's ingesting lead. 
Lawsuits are pending in Massachusetts and New York against lead paint makers, 
charging that they have failed to use safe substitutes or post warnings. 
</P>
<P>
Foxx said that he will file motions to overturn the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no evidence that indicates lead is in any way implicated" in Marcos' 
deformities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense experts contended that Marcos suffers from a rare cluster of congenital 
defects known by the acronym CHARGE, whose cause is unknown. Foxx said O'Hommel 
has never before been sued over lead in its products. 
</P>
<P>
Franco said the verdict shows that "the companies have to care about what 
they're working with . . . about their use . . . and what it can cause and what 
it can do." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy for my son's future," she said. "The system works. Maybe it'll 
make things better for everyone."

NOT-GUILTY PLEA IN SHOOTING; 
</P>
<P>
WOMAN ACCUSED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER OF ALLEGED RAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elizabeth Gooden, the Los Angeles woman who police say shot a neighbor eight 
times after the district attorney's office refused to prosecute him for 
allegedly raping her, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a charge of attempted 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
At her arraignment before Los Angeles Municipal Judge Glenette Blackwell, 
Gooden, 26, listened impassively. Similar charges against her brother, LeRoy, 
31, who, according to police, took the gun from Gooden after the shooting 
Tuesday night, were dropped earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the victim, Wilson Picquet, 38, a school bus driver, remained in 
serious condition at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell set bail at $25,000 for Gooden, who is unemployed, and scheduled a 
preliminary hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court for Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Norm Shapiro told the judge that he did not expect a long 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret what happened," he told reporters after the court proceeding, 
pointing out that there were at least three eyewitnesses to the shooting 
outside the apartment building on Coco Avenue in the Crenshaw District where 
Gooden, her brother and Picquet live. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro added that, regardless of the motive Gooden may have had for shooting 
Picquet, "this was a premeditated shooting. As far as the law is concerned, 
this is not a justified situation." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor noted that, according to police reports, Gooden was waiting for 
Picquet outside the apartment building when Picquet returned home Tuesday night 
after his release from jail, where he had been held for investigation of rape. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that Gooden shot Picquet in the chest at point-blank 
range and, after he fell, shot him seven more times. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor added that the rape allegation "does not excuse what she did." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said that a central issue in the case is whether a victim is justified 
in shooting her attacker, even after days have passed and the authorities have 
intervened. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Robert J. LaBau, who represented Gooden on Thursday, 
declined to comment on the case or on Gooden's account of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Before the shooting, Gooden had expressed frustration and disapointment to 
police and to neighbors over the refusal of the district attorney's office to 
file charges against Picquet, whom Gooden accused of raping her at his 
apartment last Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office concluded that there was not sufficient evidence 
to file the rape charges.

TORRANCE POLICE ON TRIAL IN CRASH FATAL TO TEEN-AGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An off-duty Torrance police sergeant appeared drunk about 15 minutes after his 
pickup truck and a motorcycle collided, killing its rider, a witness testified 
Thursday in a civil trial against the Torrance Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses in the first day of testimony said Sgt. Rollo Green was not at 
the scene immediately after the accident on Aug. 30, 1984, that killed 
19-year-old Kelly Rastello. The testimony seemed to support contentions by his 
family's lawyer that Green may have fled the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations against Green are part of a Los Angeles Superior Court suit 
filed by Rastello's family that seeks unspecified monetary damages from 
Torrance and alleges that Torrance officers covered up for their colleague. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Rastello family have said they will attempt to show that Green, 
who was never charged, was responsible for the accident and that the cover-up 
was part of a pattern in which Torrance officers habitually concealed 
wrongdoing by fellow police. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, witnesses testifying later in the trial are expected to review more 
than two dozen citizens complaints against police about drunkenness, sexual 
assault and other abuses that allegedly have been covered up, said Rastello's 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is being widely watched for the unprecedented view it is expected to 
offer of the police department in Torrance, a city that has long prided itself 
on resolving its disputes in-house. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to last several weeks, the trial promises to provide an exhaustive 
review of alleged acts of misconduct over several years by the county's 
third-largest police department. Before the proceedings, the city was forced to 
turn over 500,000 pages of documents, most of them police files. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Green and the city dispute the allegations. They have told the jury 
that Green was not drunk and that Rastello was speeding when he crashed into 
Green's pickup truck while it was making a left turn. The city's lawyers also 
say allegations of police misconduct are thoroughly reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Key testimony came Thursday from a San Pedro man who happened on the scene of 
the accident, at the intersection of Rolling Hills Road and Whiffletree Lane. 
He said he talked to Green 15 minutes after the accident, which occurred just 
before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Uneasy on His Feet' 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed very uneasy on his feet," said Tony Andrie. "I would use the word 
queasy. He was swaying back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
Andrie, who said he had worked as a bartender, testified: "If he was a customer 
at my bar, I would not have served him another drink. . . . That's the level of 
sobriety he was at." 
</P>
<P>
Green's lawyers attacked Andrie's credibility, repeatedly asking him why he had 
not come forward until more than four years after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not want to cause any more grief for the family," Andrie said, adding he 
did not know how important his observations were until his mother had a chance 
meeting this year with Rastello's grandmother, who mentioned the upcoming 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Andrie also testified that he helped to mop up gasoline from Rastello's 
motorcycle and that he spoke to two women who had stopped at the accident site. 
</P>
<P>
The women, returning home from a night of dinner and dancing, said they were 
the first to arrive at the crash scene. Rosalie White testified that she tried 
to comfort Rastello. "I told him that he shouldn't be afraid," she recalled. 
"That help was coming and that he shouldn't worry." Then she began to pray, she 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
The women corroborated Andrie's testimony that Green, who lived a block from 
the intersection, was not at the crash site for at least 15 minutes after the 
accident. They said that when Green did appear, to the rear of a group of 
onlookers, he did not come forward. 
</P>
<P>
Green's lawyer, Will J. Pirkey, suggested in questioning that the women might 
simply have overlooked Green because they were busy tending to the youth, who 
later died at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Shock, Bleeding 
</P>
<P>
Green was in shock and bleeding from a cut on his face after the accident, 
Pirkey said during the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance police officers have said they observed Green's behavior, performed an 
eye-gaze test and decided that he was not under the influence and should not be 
arrested. The Police Department never sampled Green's breath, blood or urine to 
determine the sergeant's blood-alcohol level. Green admitted he had been 
drinking but said he was not drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Abby Soven estimated the case will go to the jury in about five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The list of potential witnesses to be called to the stand includes Police Chief 
Donald Nash, Mayor Katy Geissert, City Manager LeRoy Jackson and several 
current and former members of the City Council.

REDS' MANAGER SAYS A FAIR HEARING BEFORE COMMISSIONER IS IMPOSSIBLE

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose reached into the huge jar of antacids on his desk, pulled out a 
handful and shoved them into his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
His stomach has bothered him for two years, but the pain is worse than ever. He 
acknowledges that he has lost weight, but refuses to say how much. He 
acknowledges that he has difficulty sleeping, but won't say how little sleep he 
gets. 
</P>
<P>
His only sanctuary is the ballpark. For 24 years as a player and five as a 
manager, it has been home. Now the game he so long has loved is tormenting him 
to an extent that he never thought possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Reds finally won a game Thursday, 6-1 before 18,072 fans at 
Riverfront Stadium, in the city where Rose has spent 21 1/2 years as a player 
and a manager. 
</P>
<P>
Camera crews and reporters funneled into his office, asking how he felt 
shedding a 10-game losing streak, the longest the Reds have endured in 23 
years. He provided glib answers, entertaining the media mob as only he can. 
</P>
<P>
When they had filtered out, Rose was nearly alone. And he talked, revealing 
everything that had been churning inside for five months. 
</P>
<P>
Rose stands accused of not only betting on baseball, but on Reds' games. The 
penalty could be a lifetime ban. The man who once relished the glory and 
attention, now loathes it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on the cover of Sports Illustrated three times since this . . . 
investigation started," Rose said, his voice starting to rise, "and I haven't 
gotten a hit. And I'm in fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on the cover of Time. It took me 4,256 hits to get on the cover of 
Time. It took me 24 years to get on the cover of Time. And all of a sudden, I'm 
accused of betting on baseball, and I'm on the cover again. 
</P>
<P>
"The easiest part of my job is coming to the ballpark. It's harder to relax at 
home watching those TV shows. I've had friends call me and thought I died 
because they saw me sitting there watching Tom Brokaw on NBC News, and all of a 
sudden, my picture's up there. They hear him say, 'He may have managed his last 
game.' They say, 'What happened to him, his plane crash or something?' 
</P>
<P>
"No, they think he bet on a baseball game." 
</P>
<P>
The office of Commissioner Bart Giamatti notified Rose in February that 
Giamatti wanted to see him in New York. He was told that an investigation had 
begun into his gambling activity. The next day, word leaked out about the 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's office was expected to reach a decision in March. It wasn't 
until May that Giamatti informed Rose that a hearing had been scheduled. Two 
months later, the only hearing that is scheduled is Monday's, when it will be 
decided in a Columbus, Ohio, court whether Rose's case will be heard in a 
federal or district court. 
</P>
<P>
Rose and his lawyers have sued, claiming that Giamatti is biased because he 
wrote to a federal judge on behalf of a convict who testified against Rose. 
Others have accused Rose of everything from racketeering to cocaine 
distribution. And always, there are the daily pleas from fans for his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been called everything in the world for the last three months," Rose 
said. "Al Capone wasn't called as many names as I've been called. Al Capone 
didn't do as much as I supposedly did. It becomes ridiculous. I mean, they're 
talking about cocaine stored at my house, and me breaking kids' legs; that was 
the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a kick out of people who say that I'm ruining baseball. This guy's 
ruining me with this . . . report. Because he believes a bunch of felons. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, all I want is just a fair shake, that's all I want. If he (Giamatti) 
didn't write that letter to the judge and make some other statements, we 
wouldn't have done all this. I got a kick out of the commissioner at the Hall 
of Fame the other day. He's making statements how he's tired of this thing 
lingering on. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean it took him three . . . months to do an investigation, and he's tired 
of it lingering on, like it's my fault because I initiated the . . . lawsuit. 
He made me initiate the lawsuit by writing a . . . letter to a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody in their right mind knows you don't send any kind of thing to a 
federal judge. A federal judge? An appointed federal judge? And tell him to 
keep it sealed? Oh, man. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, this has cost me an arm and a . . . leg just to have the opportunity 
to be fair. And everybody thinks I'm trying to hurt baseball. I'm not trying to 
hurt baseball. I love baseball." 
</P>
<P>
How much? 
</P>
<P>
"More than anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Enough to step aside until the investigation is completed? 
</P>
<P>
"No. no. I would never do that. A lot of people in my corner think stepping 
down is like saying you're guilty. I'm not saying that. I would never do that. 
People will have to get rid of me. I'll never rid myself here. This is where I 
belong." 
</P>
<P>
Does Rose believe he will be suspended from baseball for any period of time? 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I could ever get suspended for -- and this would be going way 
out on a limb, I think -- they could say I hanged around undesirable 
(characters)." 
</P>
<P>
Do you regret those friendships? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I do, but what can I do? I disassociated myself when I knew who they 
were. People don't realize that when these guys got in trouble, they weren't 
with me. They weren't hanging with me when they were in trouble. They all got 
busted for cocaine. They weren't doing that when they were with me. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, if you're hanging around people you're not supposed to hang around with, 
they ought to at least warn you, shouldn't they? (Former Commissioner) Happy 
Chandler warned (Leo) Durocher three times; that's why they suspended him. They 
warned him three . . . times." 
</P>
<P>
The most troubling aspect of the investigation, Rose says, is how everyone 
suddenly seems to have turned on him. Bookmakers that he gambled with began 
talking to investigators. Former friends and associates have lied, he said, 
trying to hurt him. Former teammates such as Johnny Bench have turned their 
backs on him. The game of baseball, he says, has a vendetta against him. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you something," Rose said. "Two years ago at the winter meetings 
in Dallas, Giamatti (then National League president) had me up in his room. He 
had me in his room. For an hour and 15 minutes. And never once said anything 
about gambling to me or anybody I hang around with. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he wanted me to help him clean up the clubhouse, make sure that people 
weren't in the clubhouse who didn't have a pass. I said fine, whatever your 
rule says, that's what we'll do. And I cleaned up the clubhouse, memorabilia 
people and stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had a problem with me gambling, he should have said something right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But if Giamatti now wants trouble, Rose says, he will gladly deliver. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me ask you a question," Rose said. "How many times is the commissioner 
going to appeal before he realizes the truth is there? How many judges have 
heard this now? (Common Pleas Court Judge Norbert) Nadel heard it. The appeals 
judge heard it. Now the federal judge. Do they have to go to the sixth 
district? Then where's the next one? 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, how many people have to tell him that he shouldn't have wrote the 
letter -- that he was biased -- before he believes it? He carries the letter 
with him. He's obsessed with it. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's going to exhaust all his appeals, he shouldn't complain how much money 
it's costing him. Or how long it's taking. I mean, he had me in three courts in 
10 days. Hey, I wish the . . . thing had never started. I didn't start the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"He had me come to New York, and I told him the . . . truth the first day he 
asked me. And they started digging into other things. They started believing 
these two . . . felons. I can't control that. 
</P>
<P>
"But I see the tide going the other way. They run out of firepower. Once they 
throw that biased, . . . (225-page investigative report) at you people (the 
media), they don't have no more fireworks." 
</P>
<P>
Rose not only believes that he will manage the rest of the season, he 
anticipates returning to the Reds in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried, to tell you the truth," Rose said. "I believe in the rules of 
baseball. I've abided by the rules of baseball for 24 years as a player, and 
now my fifth year as a manager. I got suspended for 30 days and fined $10,000 
last year (for shoving umpire Dave Pallone). I appealed it, like you have the 
right to; I lost the appeal. I shook hands with the commissioner and said, 
'Thanks for the opportunity.' 
</P>
<P>
"OK, so I don't agree with the DH every other year in the All-Star game, and 
some little things like that, but the rules of baseball I agree with. And I 
abide by them. But if I abide by that, the guy that sets forth the rules has to 
abide by them, too, and in my estimation, (Giamatti) did not abide by the 
rules. He was biased. And he prejudged me. And he can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been happy to go in front of the commissioner, but I couldn't go 
in front of the commissioner once he made me believe he was biased. I couldn't 
do it. I just couldn't do it. Because he's sitting up there with a guillotine, 
waiting to cut my . . . head off. I knew it. That's the way I felt, and you 
would, too, if you read that report." 
</P>
<P>
Rose might have swayed the public toward him from the outset by simply denying 
that he gambled on baseball. But he steadfastly refused. And once he was caught 
lying about a Pick Six ticket worth more than $240,000, of which he was 
part-owner, there were many who prejudged him. 
</P>
<P>
"People say I'm guilty because I lied about the Pick Six," Rose said. "I didn't 
lie about the Pick Six. It wasn't the commissioner's business if I hit the Pick 
Six or not, in my mind. I didn't have no hand on no bible when I told him this. 
I'm trying to protect the guy who owns the racetrack, who's my partner, who 
just gave me just half of the Pick Six, or the third of it. He just gave it to 
me. Because I got there late, he gave it to me. So I'm trying to protect him 
from that, not from anything illegal, it's just that he's in the situation 
where they want him to bet because he owns the track, but they don't want him 
to win." 
</P>
<P>
And why won't he deny beting on baseball? 
</P>
<P>
"Because it ain't going to help me by telling you that I'm not guilty," Rose 
said. "I told the right people I didn't bet on baseball. I told the 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"The best comment was no comment. A lot of people assumed I was guilty because 
I said no comment. Why ain't he denying these allegations? Why ain't he denying 
this? Why ain't he denying that? Well, I didn't want all the stuff in the 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's put Marge (Schott, owner of the Reds,) in a tough spot. She can't 
really take sides in this thing, and if she takes sides, she's going to take 
sides with the commissioner because that's baseball. And I agree with her. She 
says, 'I believe what baseball believes,' and I do, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a stout supporter of baseball, but I also have to watch out for No. 1, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Rose glanced at the clock in his office. It was 4:30; he already was a 
half-hour late for an appointment with his lawyers as he walked toward the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped to grab another handful of antacids, looked at the clock again and 
said: "It's amazing, isn't it? You bust your ass for 24 years as a player, 
entertaining people, having fun. 
</P>
<P>
"And then you got to spend most of it paying for lawyers trying to get the 
opportunity to have a fair hearing."

SAFETY TEST; 
</P>
<P>
NEWSOME STICKS HIS NECK OUT AGAIN IN RAMS' SECONDARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can't hang a price tag on two lost seasons in Vince Newsome's football 
life, seasons stolen by troublesome twists of fate and neck. Time past is 
nonrefundable. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few days before the Rams' opener, in August 1987, Newsome's father, 
Thomas, was killed in a freak carpentry accident. Vince mourned, and played on, 
though his heart wasn't quite in it. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, his mind cleared somewhat, Newsome strode head-on into tight end 
Jay Novacek of the Phoenix Cardinals at Anaheim Stadium. Newsome thought he'd 
pinched a nerve in his neck, an occupational hazard known to National Football 
League strong safeties as a "stinger" or "buzzer." 
</P>
<P>
Newsome rested a game but played four scorching quarters two weeks later 
against San Francisco, after which doctors discovered he had actually herniated 
a disk in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Newsome won't soon forget the test, called magnetic resonance imaging, that 
ultimately determined the extent of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
"They laid me on my stomach and shot dye up into my spine, which gives you an 
excruciating headache," he said. "I said, 'Can people die from doing this?' and 
they said, 'Yeah, there was a case.' You have to sign a waiver." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, a CAT-scan was administered. 
</P>
<P>
"You're laying in that CAT for a couple of hours," he said. "They strap you 
down and you're going around and around (in circles), and you're going, 'What's 
going on here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Newsome didn't know whether he was being tested or skewered. 
</P>
<P>
The news could have been worse, though -- wheelchair worse. But he would only 
miss the rest of the season, 11 games in all, and doctors assured Newsome he 
would return at full strength for the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, considering that it was his neck on the line, Newsome wasn't so trusting. 
He requested another MRI last May, painful as it would be. Doctors told him 
another test wasn't advisable. 
</P>
<P>
Newsome was examined by Dr. Robert Watkins in the spring, however, and his neck 
was pronounced healed. Newsome actually was cleared at the end of the 1988 
season, but the Rams decided against activating him for precautionary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't fair to him to put him back in a game," trainer Jim Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Newsome had not been allowed any rehabilitative work during the 
layoff. No weightlifting, no running. Nothing. Rest was the only cure. 
</P>
<P>
Newsome was restless to the point of embarrassment. It was difficult explaining 
an injury for which there was no scar or crutch to hide behind. 
</P>
<P>
"After a month, it was like, if you looked at me, you'd say there was nothing 
wrong with the guy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Newsome's recovery is more psychological than physical. Doctors say he's 
OK. Newsome won't know for sure until his helmet cracks another. He has long 
been one of the team's hardest hitters. 
</P>
<P>
"In football, it's a danger zone," Newsome said. "You can mess with a knee, 
rebuild a knee and come back. But when you mess up a neck, you can suffer 
paralysis." 
</P>
<P>
Newsome spent an entire month of the off-season pushing himself through a 
battery of tests, including full-contact drills against a body bag. 
</P>
<P>
"I told myself in May that if I felt anything, if there was anything, I would 
just stop playing," he said. "I would stop playing, no matter what point in my 
career it is, because it really isn't worth it. . . . But (now) I don't think 
about it at all. If I think about it, then it's going to take away from my 
game." 
</P>
<P>
His game was rounding into fine shape three years ago, before misfortune 
stripped Newsome of perhaps the best seasons of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"It essentially feels like I've had two years off," Newsome said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he led the Rams in tackles with 113, linebacker numbers from a strong 
safety. Though he's just 28, Newsome finds himself fighting again for his niche 
in the secondary, a battle he had already fought and won against veterans Nolan 
Cromwell and Johnnie Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Now the tables have turned. Cromwell and Johnson are gone, and Newsome stands 
alone, a veteran surrounded by eager young guns. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like I was caught in the middle of the waves," Newsome said. "The young 
waves and the old waves." 
</P>
<P>
An NFL secondary stands still for no man. Newsome must earn his place beside 
Michael Stewart, who filled Newsome's spot last season, and second-year 
safeties Anthony Newman and James Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to see him play," Coach John Robinson said of Newsome. "He's not 
had a good couple of years. Vince, at his best, we think is very good. We want 
to see him come back. All four will play. I don't see that he has a position 
that no one will take away." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the competition, Newsome said he owes younger players the benefit of 
his experience. It's a rite of passage in the Rams' secondary. Cromwell once 
handed the torch to Newsome. 
</P>
<P>
"Nolan used to do that," Newsome said. "He used to teach me all the time, even 
though he knew I could possibly play his position. Nolan did it, and I 
respected Nolan for that. That's why I knew I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Or course, there are limits. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you tell everything," he said, laughing. "I don't think anybody 
tells everything." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of offensive linemen has become serious enough for the Rams to 
sign center-guard Navy Tuiasosopo, who played with the team during the players' 
strike of 1987. These are desperate times for desperate coaches. The four 
holdout linemen -- tackles Robert Cox and Irv Pankey and guards Duval Love and 
Tony Slaton -- are threatening to disrupt preparations for the exhibition game 
against the San Francisco 49ers Aug. 6 in Tokyo. The plane leaves Monday. "If 
things don't change, we have to begin to find solutions," Coach John Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of linebacker Frank Stams' contract: He will receive a $250,000 
signing bonus with base salaries of $160,000, $185,000, $210,000 and $240,000 
the next four seasons. His package average is $261,000 a year, less than the 
two Ram second-rounders drafted below him. Linebacker Brian Smith got $270,000 
and cornerback Darryl Henley $275,000. Henley came out the big winner, taking 
up the Rams' promise to pay the highest salary to the second-rounder who signed 
first, not predicated on draft order.

CHRISTENSEN TRIES TO REGAIN WEIGHT, HIS RAIDER POSITION

In the heat of the noonday sun, Todd Christensen, all alone on the field, 
straps weights to his ankles and high-steps toward an uncertain future 
</P>
<P>
Uncertain? 
</P>
<P>
Todd Christensen? 
</P>
<P>
Curly-haired, erudite, omnipresent, photogenic, unsinkable Todd Christensen, 
the man to see on third and eight, or when you've forgotten the author of "The 
Fountainhead," or how many home runs Babe Ruth hit in 1928, could be in 
trouble? 
</P>
<P>
That's with a capital T and that rhymes with D, and that stands for Dyal. Mike 
Dyal is an unknown player from Texas A&amp;I who spent last season on injured 
reserve but is suddenly being projected as a possible starter at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
Dyal, a 240-pounder, is described as a blocker. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Shanahan seems to prefer large, blocking tight ends to smaller 
pass-catchers of the Christensen-Trey Junkin mold. Shanahan was hurt by the 
loss of bulky Andy Parker to free agency and may be looking for another hulk. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen is 33 and coming off an injury-truncated 1988 season during which 
he caught 15 passes. 
</P>
<P>
His off-season was even worse: Two major operations, the last of them 10 weeks 
ago for removal of his gall bladder. He isn't scheduled to begin contact work 
until early August. 
</P>
<P>
He earns $750,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The last two Raider seasons, as another great Raider might have put it, have 
been distinctly unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
Can or will Al Davis pay that much to a backup? 
</P>
<P>
Todd Christensen, backup? 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever beat me out," Christensen says. "I got injured. So I'd like to 
think, if I came back whole, I'd be the guy. But I suppose that remains to be 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
Does he sense the danger? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, always." 
</P>
<P>
This season more than ever before? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, 1981 was pretty bad -- but you have to go back a long time." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, he was three years into his pro career and still known chiefly as a 
bomb squad hero. The Dallas Cowboys, who drafted him No. 2 out of BYU in 1978, 
asked him to switch from fullback to tight end, but he refused. The Cowboys and 
the New York Giants released him in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
For the Raiders, he made the switch. He also made the Pro Bowl five straight 
times, caught at least 80 passes a season in 1983-87 and went over 1,000 yards 
three times, missing a fourth by 13 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the wreckage of the '87 season, with the strike and Rusty Hilger at 
quarterback, he dropped to 47 receptions but made it back to the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Christensen partially tore a knee ligament, then developed a cyst 
behind the knee. He missed nine games before returning on what he figures was 
"60% of a leg" for the finale against the Seattle Seahawks at the Coliseum, the 
game that determined the AFC West title. 
</P>
<P>
If that is to go down as his last Raider game, he went out in style. In a 
dramatic late-game drive, Jay Schroeder found Christensen for four straight 
completions. Some people told him that he was what had been missing all season. 
Since the Raiders completed an awful 44% of their passes without him, you might 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
But the hard times weren't over. One day in the off-season, he "woke up 
yellow." 
</P>
<P>
How yellow? 
</P>
<P>
"Fluorescent," says Matt Millen, who visited him. 
</P>
<P>
It was first treated as hepatitis, then by removing his gall bladder. 
Christensen's weight, which he had just built up to 229, dropped to 209. 
</P>
<P>
He started over. He's back to 222 and working as diligently as always. One of 
the last three Oakland Raiders -- with Millen and Howie Long -- and having seen 
the champions turned upside down, Christensen hates the thought of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, I don't see a depreciation of skill," Christensen says. "I see it as 
the fact that I was unfortunate enough to have an injury and I had a difficult 
off-season. If I'm being objective and looking at myself, I say I'm a risk. But 
I know myself. I know I'm not a risk." 
</P>
<P>
He remembers that ecstatic dressing room in San Diego in 1980, after the 
Raiders shocked the Chargers in the AFC championship game to send them on to 
the Super Bowl, and wonders where else he could ever find exhilaration like 
that. 
</P>
<P>
He keeps on high-stepping. On the golf course that overlooks the practice 
field, players stop to watch the solitary figure doing the curious drill. Maybe 
they recognize the head of curls. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen keeps going. A day of reckoning is coming, and he aims to be ready.

MORNING BRIEFING: SIMPLY GETTING TO MEET ON TIME IS HIGHEST HURDLE FOR TRACK 
STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonie Campbell, scheduled to compete in the 110-meter high hurdles in the New 
York Games last Saturday afternoon, boarded a bus in Rovereto, Italy, at 5 that 
morning. The bus took him to Verona, where he caught a plane to Rome. In Rome, 
he caught a 10:45 a.m. flight to New York, arriving at 2:30 p.m. During the 
flight, he changed into his track clothes. 
</P>
<P>
A car met him at JFK airport and took him to Columbia University, scene of the 
meet. He arrived at 3:45 p.m. and competed at 5 p.m. He then took a cab back to 
JFK, where his TWA flight had laid over. He re-boarded the plane at 7 p.m. and 
took off for home, arriving at LAX at 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
And how did all of this travel affect his performance? 
</P>
<P>
He ran second to two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom in 13.24 seconds. It 
was his fastest time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Add Kingdom: Asked about the exodus of athletes to Europe to compete, he told 
Newsday: "You can have meets here the quality of those in Europe. It can be 
done tomorrow. It's a matter of who's willing to sponsor it. Like the Jack In 
The Box meet in L.A. (Aug. 6.) They're offering $500,000 for a record in the 
long jump. Man, I want to long jump." 
</P>
<P>
"He was drooling," said Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the only Angel to hit home runs in the club's three home 
parks -- Wrigley Field, Dodger Stadium and Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Six-shooter: Sports Illustrated reported that the Montreal Expos have added 
Antonio Alfonseca, a 16-year-old pitcher with six fingers on each hand, to 
their Dominican Republic organization. 
</P>
<P>
Said one reporter: "You've heard of the split-fingered fastball? This kid has a 
six-fingered fastball." 
</P>
<P>
Said another: "He's going to be twice as good as Mordecai (Three Finger) 
Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Defense rests: Is Johnny Bench the greatest catcher ever? Maybe all around, he 
is, but former big league outfielder Art Shamsky, who played with Jerry Grote 
on the Miracle Mets, told Stan Hochman of the Philadelphia Daily News: "I 
played with Johnny Bench when he first came up. I played against him later on. 
I played against a lot of catchers, and I believe Jerry Grote was the best 
defensive catcher I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Add Grote: New York traded him to the Dodgers, with whom he played as a backup 
on the National League championship teams of 1977 and '78. He then retired but 
returned in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
He said: "Two years ago, I retired from baseball to be closer to my family. 
Last October, my wife left me." 
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian: How can a manager insult an umpire without talking to him? When a 
gang of Montreal Expos advanced on an umpire while Gene Mauch was managing, he 
told them, "The first guy who lays a hand on this blind, old man is fined 50 
bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be told Dept.: Said Lee Trevino, reflecting on his U.S. Open win in 
1968, his first victory: "You know what my greatest enjoyment was? I was in the 
scorer's tent when Arnold Palmer came in. He had been placed in the final 
threesome because of television. My greatest enjoyment was meeting Arnold 
Palmer. That was a bigger thrill, at that moment, than winning." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Bob (Buck) Rodgers, now managing the Montreal Expos. He hit two 
homers at Wrigley Field, two at Dodger Stadium and seven at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Angel reliever Greg Minton, on going to arbitration while with the 
San Francisco Giants: "I knew I was in trouble when the arbitrator asked what 
we meant by such symbols as IP, BB and ERA."

ORIOLES LOSE MORE GROUND IN DEFEAT BY TWINS

<P>
The Baltimore Orioles' longest losing streak this season reached eight games 
Thursday night when Kent Hrbek drove in three runs and led the Minnesota Twins 
to a 10-6 victory at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles' Americsn League East lead was narrowed to four games over Toronto 
and Cleveland, their smallest margin since June 17. Baltimore has lost the 
first seven of a 14-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore begins a three-game series in Kansas City tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Hrbek, who hit two home runs in the Twins' 5-4 victory Wednesday night, hit a 
two-run double in the first inning and had a RBI grounder in the third to make 
it 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Smith (6-4) did not give up a run although he faced a bases-loaded, no-out 
threat in the first inning. He yielded seven hits, including Craig 
Worthington's two-run home run in the seventh, in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins chased Pete Harnish with four runs in the sixth. Kirby Puckett got 
his third hit of the game, a two-run single, and Brian Harper had an RBI 
single. Gary Gaetti drew a bases-loaded walk from reliever Mark Thurmond for an 
8-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 7, Kansas City 2 -- Kevin Romine had a double and hit his first homer of 
the season as the Red Sox ended Royal Tom Gordon's seven-game winning streak at 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon (11-4) gave up five runs on eight hits and four walks in 5 1/3 innings. 
It was his first loss since May 28. 
</P>
<P>
John Dopson (9-5), who allowed three hits and seven walks in five-plus innings, 
was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
With a 4-0 lead, Dopson walked three consecutive batters at the start of the 
sixth and was replaced by Rob Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy struck out two, but Willie Wilson hit a two-run double before Kevin 
Seitzer grounded out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox took a 2-0 lead in the first on two walks and singles by Danny Heep 
and Nick Esasky. 
</P>
<P>
Romine led off the third with a double and scored when Matt Winters bobbled 
Mike Greenwell's single. The hit extended Greenwell's hitting streak to 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"Batting third and hitting a home run was the furthest thing from my mind a few 
weeks ago," Romine said. "I was just hoping I'd get called up again." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 11, Detroit 1 -- Rob Deer's fourth career grand slam capped a six-run 
sixth inning as the Brewers won at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Yount had two singles, extending his hitting streak to 17 games and 
matching a streak by New York's Don Mattingly as the longest this season in the 
AL. Ozzie Guillen of Chicago equaled it Thursday night against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Hudson, the second Detroit pitcher, gave up eight hits and eight runs 
in three innings. Starter Paul Gibson (2-5) went five innings. He last won on 
May 21.

A state judge refused to issue a temporary injunction that would have halted 
all Little League playoff games in Texas pending the outcome of a lawsuit. 
State District Judge Arthur Lesher denied the requested freeze, meaning the 
games will continue as scheduled, attorney Blaise Heaney said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed by James R. King Jr., father of a player, who was upset that 
another team was not disqualified from the playoffs even though a team member 
was not eligible to play.

An investigation into Howard University's football program from 1983 to '88 has 
uncovered violations of both National Collegiate Athletic Assn. and Mid-Eastern 
Athletic Conference rules, said Carl Anderson, the university's vice president 
for student affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry, began in March, prompted by the discovery that nine of the team's 
starters played after their eligibility had expired. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the alleged violations, if proven, could cost the school its 1987 
conference championship. An internal investigation of the program also revealed 
irregularities in the financial aid program.

A Miami-area man accused of operating the largest clandestine steroid 
laboratory in the country was sentenced to 22 months in federal prison. U.S. 
District Judge William Hoeveler also put Justin Rogers Routt, 29, on probation 
for three years and fined him $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Routt pleaded guilty shortly after his April arrest to conspiracy, mail fraud 
and adulteration and misbranding of prescription drugs. The Food and Drug 
Administration charged that Routt produced both steroids and inert substances 
that were sold as steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents who raided Routt's lab and warehouses found about $2 million 
worth of bulk and finished steroid products and labels for shipping nationally.

IRS OFFICIALS SAY THEIR AGENCY'S INTERNAL POLICING WORKS WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top officials of the Internal Revenue Service defended the agency Thursday 
against charges of unethical conduct, telling a House subcommittee that their 
own internal policing system is working well and that ethical lapses by 
employees are "isolated." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Doug Barnard Jr. (D-Ga.), the subcommittee chairman who has been 
directing a yearlong investigation of the tax collection agency, angrily 
responded that IRS officials cannot "gloss over" repeated instances of 
misconduct uncovered by his panel. 
</P>
<P>
Among the matters under consideration by the panel are allegations that a 
former director of the agency's Los Angeles regional office for criminal tax 
cases extended favorable treatment to friends and and thwarted internal 
inquiries into his activities. 
</P>
<P>
Barnard said he was "astounded" that newly appointed IRS Commissioner Fred T. 
Goldberg and others had expressed general satisfaction with the agency's 
internal inspection methods. "You're not dealing with ignoramuses on this 
committee," he shouted at one point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angry Reaction 
</P>
<P>
The normally low-key, courtly Barnard exploded in anger after Michael J. 
Murphy, senior IRS deputy commissioner, said that "isolated instances" of 
potential wrongdoing "should not detract from the overall integrity of our work 
force." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy added that "all of the cases reviewed by the subcommittee have been 
investigated by IRS and, when appropriate, referred for prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe you would come here and gloss over 12 months of investigation 
by this subcommittee," Barnard told Murphy, his voice rising. 
</P>
<P>
He said the House Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and 
monetary affairs had "admitted on the first day of these hearings" that the 
majority of the agency's 110,000 employees are ethical, law-abiding citizens. 
But Barnard said Murphy's statement that the agency is policing its own misfits 
was typical of "the career attitude of the IRS that 'we can do no wrong.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a real world that you described today," Barnard said, noting that his 
panel has heard testimony that IRS inspectors find it difficult to gather 
evidence against unethical agents because potential whistle blowers "have a 
fear of retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, team loyalty often is stressed to keep the agency's image 
untarnished, Barnard said. He said many agents have been led to believe that 
"if you're not a team player, you're off the team." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg testified that "we must be willing, and we are, to address openly and 
candidly the challenges that face us as an agency." 
</P>
<P>
But the new IRS chief, who took office earlier this month, said the agency's 
inspection division is functioning well. "I can see little to be gained from 
dwelling on the details of each matter considered by the subcommittee," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused of Favoritism 
</P>
<P>
Much of the House panel's investigation has focused on the IRS office in Los 
Angeles that handles criminal tax matters and its former chief, Ronald Saranow. 
Witnesses have described Saranow, who resigned from the IRS last year, as an 
overbearing official who brooked no dissent and tried to monitor an internal 
investigation into his activities. 
</P>
<P>
Although no charges were recommended against Saranow by the IRS, the 
subcommittee has found that he developed an unusually close relationship with 
the founders of Guess? Inc., a Los Angeles jeans manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Saranow has also been accused of favoritism for allowing a group of tax evaders 
represented by Richard Trattner, a former IRS lawyer and friend, to escape 
prosecution by paying taxes anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Saranow's tax amnesty procedures for Trattner's clients, Goldberg 
remarked, "We're going to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy and other officials said that, although they had no personal knowledge 
of the practice during the 10 years it existed, it did not appear to be illegal 
or even irregular. They said the agency has often followed unwritten and 
"informal" procedures to get delinquent taxpayers to pay back taxes in return 
for an IRS pledge of no prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Tax lawyers said the procedures were described in official IRS manuals and thus 
were sanctioned by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the subcommittee has received evidence of abuses outside the Los 
Angeles area, including misuse of government funds, acceptance of gratuities by 
IRS agents and special treatment in hiring relatives of IRS officials in such 
cities as San Francisco, Chicago, Brooklyn and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deeply Troubled' 
</P>
<P>
Barnard asked Goldberg what action he contemplated in response to allegations 
that some IRS officials in Los Angeles who were loyal to Saranow had tried to 
help him "control" the inspection division's investigation of him. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS chief replied that he was "deeply troubled" by such charges but he made 
no specific promises. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot give you a precise answer or be specific about what I'm going to do," 
he said. "But this matter will be given my personal attention." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, responding to allegations that Saranow had sought to develop a close 
relationship with Debbie Jones, a Los Angeles supervisor in the inspection 
division, replied: "The problem we encountered is that everybody knew rumors 
but nobody knew facts." 
</P>
<P>
He said the relationship may have been totally professional, but since Jones 
was the first woman field manager in the IRS inspection division, some 
observers possibly adopted a more sinister view of the friendship.

State Has Until Noon to Challenge Bond: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 
has given the state until noon today to challenge a $16.3-million bond 
requirement for a U.S. Supreme Court appeal of the merger of the Lucky and 
Alpha Beta market chains. The court told California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp 
to verify his decision not to post the bond and to state the reasons he 
considers the bond requirement illegal. For the moment, the court left in place 
an order blocking the $2.5-billion consolidation of the chains, which have a 
total of 550 stores. The order was signed by Judges Cecil Poole and Diarmuid 
O'Scannlain. Van de Kamp challenged the merger last year, saying it would 
reduce competition and cost California consumers $400 million.

FIBBING BY JUST A HAIR, ADS FOR OGGI DO GET OGLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone asks the same question: Is it really her hair? 
</P>
<P>
If the truth must be bared, the answer, alas, is no. These are not real-life 
Lady Godivas who have appeared in provocative print ads for Oggi, the Beverly 
Hills hair-care products maker. The extra hair has simply been weaved into that 
of the models. 
</P>
<P>
But never mind. No one ever said that the purpose of advertising is to present 
reality. The purpose, of course, is to get attention and sell products. And 
certainly these ads -- created by an obscure Los Angeles ad firm that employs 
just nine people -- have done that for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, last week one of the most respected names in advertising research -- 
Starch INRA Hooper Inc. -- said that these ads for Oggi ranked among the top 
dozen print ads of 1988, as measured by consumer recall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Male Ads Next 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for an ad agency that was set up just three years ago when its chief 
executive took a $4,000 advance on his credit card. "This is just the 
beginning," said David MacEachern, president of David/Scott Advertising. 
"Within the next year, we expect to run these same ads -- with men." 
</P>
<P>
Men? That's right, men wrapped in several yards of hair, just as nine models -- 
including socialite Cornelia Guest -- have done before them. Though MacEachern 
won't reveal who the men are, he said that several of those being considered 
are "very masculine" TV and film celebrities. Meanwhile, he said, 
representatives for a number of top female celebrities have also inquired about 
how their clients can become "Oggi girls." 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone want to pose for an ad clothed only in hair? Well, for one 
thing, the ads get noticed. Oggi -- which is sold only in beauty salons -- 
spent less than $6 million on its ad campaign last year. But in the Starch poll 
it ranked higher in consumer recall in the hair-care category than did 
second-place Clairol, which spent many times that to advertise one of its 
brands of hair-care products. Nearly 71% of consumers surveyed remembered the 
Oggi ad, while only 65% recalled the Clairol ad. 
</P>
<P>
"They simply hit on a fascinating way to show the product in use," said Philip 
W. Sawyer, editor of Starch Tested Copy, a newsletter distributed by the 
Mamaroneck, N.Y.-based research firm. "Keep in mind, these guys went up against 
some really big manufacturers who not only hire major ad agencies, but spend 
lots of money on their advertising." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the "Lady Godiva" ad campaign actually came from a photographer 
who was shooting photos for an article on so-called hair extensions for a trade 
magazine. Oggi liked the concept so much that it began running the ads even 
before its hair-care products were ready for mass distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"We created incredible demand," said Ramon Abi-Rached, president of Oggi, which 
means "today" in Italian. Sales, which exceeded $15 million the first year, are 
expected to surpass $30 million this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selling Fantasy 
</P>
<P>
Although few question the effectiveness of the ad campaign, at least one 
advertising executive was miffed to hear that the hair in the ad is actually a 
prop. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept is arresting," said Nancy Shalek, president of the Shalek Agency, 
a Santa Monica ad firm. "But if the hair on these models is fake, that's not a 
real reflection of what the product does, and that's disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone objects to the fake hair. "The ads aren't selling hair care, 
they're selling fantasy," said Brandon French, executive vice president and 
creative director at the Los Angeles office of Evans Communications. "The ads 
say to all women, 'Try this product, it is a man-pleaser.' " 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the ad has caused Oggi and its ad firm plenty of headaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say this ad isn't good for kids to see," said MacEachern, whose ad 
agency has picked up several new clients who have been impressed with the Oggi 
ads. "But I wonder what's worse for a kid to see -- this ad, or turning on the 
nightly news and watching the same plane crash 50 times?"

PARAMOUNT AGREES TO SELL FINANCE UNIT TO FORD; 
</P>
<P>
$3.35-BILLION DEAL MAY HELP FIRM BUY MORE COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Paramount Communications, taking the last step to becoming a pure media and 
entertainment concern, said Thursday that it has agreed to sell its big finance 
arm to Ford Motor Co. for $3.35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Associates Corp., the nation's third-largest independent finance 
company, will bring Paramount net proceeds of $2.7 billion and an after-tax 
profit of $1.3 billion, Paramount said. Much of the money may soon be used to 
carry out Paramount's plans to expand by acquiring other communications 
companies, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is "the last step in our strategic development into a pure 
communications company," Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis said in a 
statement. "It is our intention to aggressively build these core businesses and 
accelerate our growth worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
The deal will greatly expand Ford's financial services operations, a goal that 
the auto company has had for some time. With plenty of money to spend and 
growing confidence about its abilities to manage a financial service firm, Ford 
has lately considered a number of big acquisitions in the financial services 
area. 
</P>
<P>
While Associates is largely a consumer finance business, analysts noted that 
its commercial finance operations are heavily involved in providing loans for 
large trucks and trailers. In this, it will fit well within Ford's Financial 
Services Group, which also has emphasized truck financing. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Ford Chairman Donald E. Peterson said Associates has an 
"excellent strategic fit with our existing financial services business and 
provides the basis for meaningful growth through an expanded product line." 
</P>
<P>
The Associates' current chairman, Reece A. Overcash, will continue in the post, 
reporting to Kenneth Whipple, president of Ford Financial Services Group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price in Middle 
</P>
<P>
The Associates' consumer business includes real estate secured loans, bank 
credit cards, direct installment and revolving credit loans, mortgage banking 
and home relocation services. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the price was in the middle of the expected range. At a meeting 
in June, Paramount's Davis told analysts that an estimate of $2.5 billion was 
too low and that $5 billion was too high. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an OK price," said an investment banker who was familiar with the 
transaction but did not represent either party. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just three days after Paramount gave up a bitter, 
seven-week quest to take over Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In Paramount's court battle with its target, Time released a confidential 
document in which a Paramount investment bank, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., 
speculated that the sale of Associates could bring proceeds of $2.66 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street sources said four to six companies made firm bids for Associates. 
Among those that looked the finance firm over were domestic and Japanese 
insurance companies, the credit arms of more than one auto maker and General 
Electric Co., the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
GE Capital is the largest U.S. finance company, followed by Household Finance. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount has recently been rumored as a possible takeover candidate, and the 
extra cash from the deal may make it more attractive to a would-be acquirer. 
</P>
<P>
J. Kendrick Noble Jr., analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said he had 
expected that Paramount might wait until it was prepared to make its next 
acquisition before it sold Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's stock rose again in composite trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, closing Thursday at $59.25 a share, up $1.125. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operating Income Tripled 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Associates reported gross revenue of more than $2 billion and 
operating income of $373 million, or 46% of Paramount's total. The company 
posted record income for 12 years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Dallas, the firm was founded in 1918 and acquired by Paramount in 
1968. It has provided Paramount -- formerly called Gulf &amp; Western -- 
insurance against downturns in Paramount's more volatile entertainment 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1982 and 1988, operating income more than tripled -- to $372.4 million 
from $99.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Davis had also expressed frustration that Wall Street had not valued 
Paramount's stock as high as he believed it deserved because the company was an 
amalgam of financial services and communications properties.

Chrysler Announces Cost-Cutting Plan: Chrysler Corp. said it plans to cut its 
white-collar staff by about 2,300 people as part of a $1-billion cost-reduction 
effort designed to restore its competitiveness in a soft U.S. auto market. The 
job cuts represent about 8% of Chrysler's U.S. corporate staff of 31,000, and 
the auto maker said it hoped the reductions would be done mainly through early 
retirements and attrition. In addition, Chrysler said it set up a special bonus 
program for its top 2,000 managers, who will invest up to 10% of their annual 
salaries over the next 15 months and be repaid only if the company meets its 
cost-reduction goals. "Car and truck business in the United States is 
undergoing a dramatic and permanent transformation that puts enormous pressures 
on all manufacturers to get their programs and costs in line," said Chairman 
Lee A. Iacocca.

Paine Webber to Pay Damages: The American Arbitration Assn. panel has made an 
award totaling $1.85 million against Paine Webber Inc. for breach of fiduciary 
duty to client Leonard A. Aaron during the 1987 stock market crash. Aaron, a 
co-founder of the Aaron Bros. art supply stores in Los Angeles, alleged lack of 
supervision on his account and said he was not told of the extent of the risks 
to which he was exposed. Aaron is to receive $500,000 in compensatory damages 
and is relieved of $1.35 million of debt and interest claimed by the brokerage 
firm. Aaron had sought $3.3 million in compensatory damages, but the panel held 
that, as a knowledgeable investor, he was partly responsible for his losses.

<P>
GM PROFIT SLUMPS 3.9% IN QUARTER; FORD'S FALLS 15.6%

<TEXT>
<P>
General Motors Corp. said its second-quarter net income dropped 3.9%, and Ford 
Motor Co. posted a 15.6% quarterly profit decline Thursday, evidence of a 
softening U.S. vehicle market and the costs of buyer incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies said the results reflected a weakening car and truck market and 
the cost of incentives they used in efforts to boost sales, a trend industry 
analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
GM earned $1.45 billion during the three months ended June 30, compared to 
$1.51 billion during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
GM revenue, which includes sales by the GM Hughes Electronics Corp., Electronic 
Data Systems Corp. and General Motors Acceptance Corp. subsidiaries that 
reported earnings Wednesday, rose 1.3% during the quarter to $33.6 billion from 
$33.18 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, the nation's second-largest auto maker, reported that it made $1.4 
billion during the quarter this year, compared to $1.66 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ford revenue rose to $25.9 billion from $24.96 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings from Ford's financial services group fell 19.9% to $173 million, due 
to lower net interest margins, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp., the nation's third-largest auto maker, is to report its 
second-quarter earnings on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's U.S. profits softened due to expensive incentive programs and reduced 
profit margins, said David M. McCammon, Ford treasurer and vice president for 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives pose a double threat for auto makers' profits. When sales slump, 
profits generally do too. To boost sales and profits, companies gamble a bit by 
offering incentives that are costly in the short-term but designed to produce 
increased consumer interest and more buyers in the long-term. 
</P>
<P>
But when interest wanes, as recent sales declines apparently indicate, returns 
on incentive costs may come later, if at all, and that cuts into short-term 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
GM's domestic car and truck sales through the first half of this year were 7.7% 
behind last year's pace and Ford's were down by 3.6%. 
</P>
<P>
McCammon said incentives during the second quarter cost Ford between $600 and 
$700 a vehicle, up sharply from the $200 to $300 average cost during the first 
quarter of this year and the second quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
GM spokesman Terry Sullivan said per-car incentive costs for the quarter were 
unavailable. However, GM spent about $715 per car last year on incentives and 
said costs for the programs would be higher this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's two largest auto makers also said their overseas operations 
continued to do well, making up for profit shortfalls in their North American 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"GM's North American automotive operations continue to improve their operating 
efficiencies, while overseas earnings in 1989 are exceeding the record levels 
achieved in 1988," said a joint statement by GM Chairman Roger B. Smith and 
President Robert C. Stempel. 
</P>
<P>
"They both had good first halves of the year in Europe," said analyst Joshua 
Harari, of Standard &amp; Poors Corp. in New York. "This plays an important 
part in supporting their earnings -- it has for the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of the year, GM earned $3.01 billion, up 15.7% from 
$2.6 billion during the first six months of last year. Revenue during the 
January-June period this year rose to $59.63 billion from $56.34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's earnings for the first half of 1989 fell 7.6% to $3.04 billion from 
$3.29 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose to $51.76 billion from $48.15 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
GM and Ford said they were continuing cost-cutting programs to improve their 
profitability in the face of a softer economy and forecasts of lower vehicle 
sales next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market surged to another post-crash high in brisk trading Thursday as 
the latest drug industry merger and optimism about the chances for lower 
interest rates brought buyers flocking into the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials closed at a new post-crash high of 
2,635.43, up 22.38, producing a gain of 52.35 for the past two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Various measures of activity in the broader market reached record levels. The 
composite index of all common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange rose 
2.08 to 190.22, an all-time high. The American Stock Exchange's market value 
index also set a record. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume surged to 213.68 million shares from 188.27 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 2 to 1 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,021 up, 496 down and 
483 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The market built on the buying momentum triggered Wednesday by signs that the 
Federal Reserve Board is allowing more money to feed into the banking system in 
an apparent bid to pump up economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
The view that the economy needs the stimulation that lower interest rates would 
provide was bolstered by a Commerce Department report showing that the gross 
national product, the broadest gauge of economic activity, expanded at a feeble 
1.7% annual rate in the April-June quarter. 
</P>
<P>
John D. Connolly, chairman of the investment committee at Dean Witter Reynolds 
Inc., said the GNP reading wasn't bad enough to fan recession fears. 
</P>
<P>
"It was weak, but we're not talking negative," he said. "Just under 2%, that's 
not particularly frightening." 
</P>
<P>
Besides upbeat feelings about interest rates, a number of forces helped carry 
the market aloft. Drug and health-care stocks attracted significant investor 
interest, sparked by a surprise announcement that Bristol-Myers and Squibb have 
agreed to merge in a stock-swap deal. 
</P>
<P>
Squibb soared 24 3/4 to 112 1/2; Bristol-Myers dropped 2 3/8 to 49 1/2 and was 
the most heavily traded stock on the Big Board with more than 4.5 million 
shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
Other gainers among drug and health-care stocks included: Upjohn, up 1 5/8 to 
33; Abbott Laboratories, up 2 to 64 7/8; Pfizer, up 2 1/2 to 63 3/4; Warner 
Lambert, up 1 to 108; Syntex, up 1 3/4 to 50, and Merck, a Dow industrial 
average component, up 2 1/4 to 77 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Another blue chip gainer that helped boost the Dow industrial index was USX, 
which jumped 2 to 37 1/8 on volume of about 2.68 million shares. Elsewhere 
among blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph added 1 1/4 to 40 5/8, 
International Business Machines gained 1/2 to 113 and Eastman Kodak rose 1 1/2 
to 48 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler, which announced a $1-billion cost-cutting program because of sagging 
sales, fell 1 1/4 to 24 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors moved ahead by 3/8 to 45 1/8 despite reporting a 3.9% drop in 
second-quarter income. Ford, which said its earnings were off 15.6%, rose 3/8 
to 50 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific was among the most heavily traded NYSE-listed issues and 
closed 1 1/8 higher at 51 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices on the Tokyo stock exchange rose across the board to a new record 
high as investors snatched up stocks in heavy trading. The 225-share Nikkei 
index gained 269.45 to close at a record high of 34,785.28. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stock prices were sharply higher as the market drew inspiration from 
a strong pound, a robust performance on Wall Street and a renewal of 
speculative buying interest. The Financial Times 100-share index added 19.2 
points to 2,283.7. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices surged, strengthened the Commerce Department's report on the drop 
in the GNP. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose nearly one point or $10 per $1,000 in face 
amount. Its yield dropped to 8.02% from 8.10% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Credit market strategists said the Commerce Department's report confirmed other 
evidence that the economy has slowed, allowing the Federal Reserve to relax its 
grip on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers that came out this morning on the second quarter were very 
positive for the market," said Mary Clarkin, senior vice president at the 
fixed-income division of Nikko Securities Co. International in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Bondholders generally welcome such news because a slowdown in the economy 
implies less demand for goods and services, easing the risk of inflation which 
erodes the value of their investment. 
</P>
<P>
Slower growth also encourages the Fed to take steps that would lower interest 
rates to encourage borrowing and stimulate the economy. Lower rates make 
fixed-income investments such as bonds more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9%, up from 8.50% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said there was no special significance to the rise because the 
Wednesday figure was an aberration, coinciding with the final day of a period 
for banks to report on their reserves. On Tuesday, the rate was 9.063%. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of coffee futures sank to their lowest level in more than 13 years on 
New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange as a market shakeout stemming 
from the suspension of export quotas continued. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, soybean futures rallied, ending a five-day slide; crude oil 
futures fell for the fifth straight session; precious metals retreated, and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Green, unroasted coffee beans settled 1.22 to 1.93 cents lower, with the 
contract for delivery in September at 83.44 cents a pound, the lowest price for 
a near-month coffee futures contract since early 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the price drop reflected aggressive new selling of coffee by 
Mexico, Brazil and Indonesia in a bid to increase their shares of the recently 
freed market and empty warehouses before new-crop coffee hits the market. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of coffee futures have fallen more than 25% since July 3, when the 
74-nation International Coffee Organization suspended export quotas and coffee 
became a free market. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the world's largest coffee-growing nations have fought for market 
share by dropping their asking prices and encouraging exporters to sell as much 
coffee as they can. 
</P>
<P>
During this week alone, Colombia announced subsidies enabling exporters to sell 
Colombian coffee at prices below production cost and Mexico said it planned to 
sell 3.4 million 132-pound bags of coffee in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the quota system they would have sold around 1 million bags," said 
Esther Eskanasy, a coffee market analyst in New York with Cargill Investor 
Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"With the new crop coming in less than two months, most producers are trying to 
make up volume instead of price," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most prices of grain and soybean futures advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade 
in a modest, technically inspired recovery from steep declines earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The rally marked the first day-to-day advance in the soybean market in more 
than a week. 
</P>
<P>
But experts said the rally had no basis in supply and demand reality, and that 
rainy weather forecasts for the Midwest and signs of a slowdown in grain 
exports would probably press prices back into a downward course. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 1.50 to 6 cents higher, with September at $3.8975 a bushel; corn 
was 3 to 4.75 cents higher, with September at $2.325 a bushel; oats 1.50 cents 
lower to 0.25 cent higher, with September at $1.43 a bushel; soybeans were 3.25 
to 6.25 cents higher, with August at $6.68 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil futures fell to a five-month low amid persistent pessimism on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange. The market rallied early with the September 
contract's price climbing as high as $18.64 a barrel. But prices plunged in a 
late selloff that accelerated when September fell below $18.25. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 to 18 cents lower, with September 
at $18.12 a barrel; heating oil was 0.23 to 0.53 cent lower, with August at 
49.26 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.03 to 0.64 cent higher, with 
August at 51.98 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver futures edged lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, wiping 
the modest gains of the previous session.

SUN MICROSYSTEMS FORECASTS LOSS; FOUL-UP BLAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sun Microsystems, the nation's largest manufacturer of powerful computer 
workstations, announced Thursday that it expects to report a fourth-quarter 
loss next month of as much as $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-year-old Silicon Valley company, a fast-growing firm that until recently 
had been a favorite on Wall Street, said it could not assure that it will be 
profitable in its current quarter, which ends Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Sun has blamed its downturn partly on an internal data-processing foul-up that 
hampered its ability to track incoming orders and production rates. As a 
result, analysts said, the company did not detect early enough that order rates 
for its new line of computers introduced in April fell below initial 
expectations. That, in turn, caused Sun to make too many machines of some 
models and not enough of others. 
</P>
<P>
Sun's control problems may have been heightened by the recent loss of two 
top-level members of the company's inner management circle. Bernard Lacroute, 
executive vice president and second-ranking executive, resigned abruptly in 
April and is currently working as a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. Two 
months later, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Graziano left for a similar post 
at Apple Computer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Revenue 
</P>
<P>
Despite its problems, the company said it would report revenue of $1.75 billion 
to $1.77 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, a jump of about 65% from 
the prior year. Revenue for the fourth quarter, it said, would be in the range 
of $425 million to $435 million, up about 16% to 19%. Losses in the fourth 
quarter, the company said, would range from $20 million to $26 million, 
contrasted with a profit of $25.3 million in the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Although a loss for the final quarter had been widely expected since the 
company warned Wall Street of its problems in early June, the scope of 
Thursday's announcement still surprised some analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is most distressing," said Peter Rogers of Robertson, Colman &amp; 
Stephens, a San Francisco brokerage. "The problems are deeper than people 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said he was specifically concerned that fourth-quarter revenue was in 
the range of $425 million, rather than the $500 million that company officials 
had told analysts in early June. Further, he said he was dismayed that the 
company has not entirely fixed its internal computer and financial controls 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical Time 
</P>
<P>
In its announcement, the company acknowledged that "some data management and 
financial analysis and reporting tasks are not yet fully functional although 
the integrity of the system is improving rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
The problems come at a critical time for Sun. Competition in the workstation 
industry, always stiff, has intensified in recent months. Digital Equipment 
Corp. has introduced a new product lineup that challenges Sun's aggressive 
pricing and Hewlett-Packard acquired Apollo Computer to strengthen its position 
in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The next six months are critical for Sun," said Bruce Jenkins, vice president 
of Daratech, a Cambridge, Mass., market research firm. "The company can't 
operate on flair alone anymore. It has to improve its credibility with its 
customers and improve its operations and its internal controls."

SECURITY PACIFIC GETS STAKE IN MITSUI UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a reversal of a trend, Security Pacific Corp. agreed Thursday to buy a 20% 
stake in Japanese-owned Mitsui Manufacturers Bank of Los Angeles for $38 
million, strengthening international ties between Security Pacific and Mitsui 
Bank Ltd. of Japan 
</P>
<P>
The deal with Mitsui, the world's ninth-largest bank, is only the latest 
transaction between the two banking giants and fits with Security Pacific's 
strategy to pursue the growing "middle market" of California business customers 
who are the mainstays of Mitsui Manufacturers' business. 
</P>
<P>
For Security Pacific, which has a Tokyo office and ambitions in Japan, the deal 
further cements a relationship with Mitsui. Last month, Security Pacific agreed 
to sell the Japanese bank a 5% interest in its commercial and consumer finance 
unit for $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The deal "is an adjunct to our middle market strategy . . . in view of the fact 
that they (Mitsui Manufacturers) have a number of relationships with Japanese 
companies," said Robert H. Smith, president and chief executive of Security 
Pacific National Bank. "It gives us an opportunity to participate in those 
relationships," including loans that may exceed Mitsui Manufacturers' limits, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts saw the deal as unique. "It's kind of a first," said George Salem, 
senior banking analyst with Prudential-Bache Research in New York. "In the 
past, it's been the foreigners buying the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
The deal affords Mitsui Manufacturers access to Security Pacific's computer and 
operations technology and management expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific will provide one of its own executives to become president and 
chief operating officer of Mitsui Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help in Tokyo 
</P>
<P>
Current President Yutaro Hayashi will retain his other title of chief 
executive, said Takao Umino, a senior vice president with Mitsui Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Mitsui Bank agreed to help Security Pacific's Tokyo office by 
providing operational and technical support -- a way for the American bank to 
get a leg up in the notoriously insular Japanese market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The two banks will also exchange operational and product support and referrals. 
Mitsui Manufacturers' customers include Japanese corporations doing business in 
the United States, companies that are normally difficult for U.S. banks to woo. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsui and Security Pacific have cooperated in the past, including a joint 
venture last year in private banking. 
</P>
<P>
Acquisition of the Mitsui Manufacturers stake coincides with Security Pacific's 
recent decision to form a middle market bank of its own, designed to go after 
the growing population of businesses with $2 million to $25 million in annual 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsui Manufacturers Bank was formed in 1981 when Mitsui Bank of California 
acquired the old Manufacturers Bank, formed in 1962 to service the garment 
industry. In the first six months of this year, the bank reported $5.7 million 
in earnings on assets of $1.4 billion. The bank has 12 branches, mostly in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific Corp. is the parent of Security Pacific National Bank, with 
550 branches statewide. In terms of assets, Security Pacific is the nation's 
fifth-largest bank holding company and California's second largest.

HOME TECH: DIGITAL TAPE COMPROMISE SEEN AS A SIGN OF CHANGING AUDIO TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 20 years, there will be no threat of digital audio tape (DAT) moving in on 
the compact-disc business because there will be no digital audio tape and there 
will be no compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
That is the assessment of music retailers, audio engineers and others involved 
in the recording industry upon hearing this week about a truce between record 
companies and Japanese audio equipment manufacturers in the two-year-old war 
over the future of DAT. 
</P>
<P>
"The no-moving-part product will be the next major breakthrough," predicted Bob 
Barrett, owner of the Compact Disc Center in Los Alamitos. "You'll just go out 
and buy a chip, snap it in place and all the information will be downloaded 
into your stereo system -- which will essentially be a computer system." 
</P>
<P>
In the short run, however, Barrett sees no threat to his business. Compact 
discs will be preferred over DAT or anything else, at least through the 
mid-1990s, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
Word leaked out earlier this week from Athens, Greece, that threatened to rein 
in the burgeoning compact-disc business in the United States. At a summit 
between U.S. record companies and Japanese audio-equipment manufacturers, 
negotiators reportedly reached a compromise agreement over introduction of DAT 
technology into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the announcement has been embargoed until today, but sources have 
already revealed that the compromise calls for inclusion of a special audio 
chip in all DAT machines imported from Japan. The audio chip would permit 
compact disc owners to record their discs on the high-quality, state-of-the-art 
digital audio tape, but would prevent DAT-to-DAT dubbing -- a possibility that 
has driven fear into the hearts of major record-company executives who believe 
that the fine reproduction quality of DAT could lead to widespread pirating and 
erosion of record sales. 
</P>
<P>
"But they have to know that it's the nature of technology to strive to improve 
fidelity," said Don Palmquist, president of La Mirada-based Yamaha Electronics. 
"It won't end with DAT. 
</P>
<P>
"The next generation we'll probably see by the mid-1990s will be a recordable 
compact disc," he continued. "The technology is still in its infancy in the lab 
now, but by then we will see a disc you can erase and record again and it'll be 
for both audio and video." 
</P>
<P>
Since Japanese stereo manufacturers such as Casio, Marantz and Pioneer first 
attempted to import DAT players in 1987, the Recording Industry Assn. of 
America has attempted to block DAT marketing. The RIAA, which acts as the 
federal lobbying arm of the six major U.S. record labels (Warners, Capitol, 
MCA, RCA, CBS and Polygram), argued on Capitol Hill for a device that would 
prevent DAT recorders from dubbing one cassette to another. 
</P>
<P>
RIAA representatives claimed then, and now, that the sound-reproduction quality 
with digital tape is so good that consumers who bought DAT recorders could 
illegally reproduce recorded music, thereby cutting into the profits of 
artists, distributors and manufacturers in the $5-billion-a-year recording 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
But the audio-equipment manufacturers' lobbying arm, the Electronic Industry 
Assn., countered by forming the Home Recording Rights Coalition. The ad hoc 
organization clashed with the RIAA before several congressional committees, 
arguing that any device that prevented dubbing would infringe on consumers' 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting battle split the recording industry, with artists ranging from 
Roberta Flack to Don Henley siding with the RIAA and the major labels it 
represents, and Stevie Wonder and several of the smaller independent labels 
siding with the EIA. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened was this idea that Mr. and Mrs. America would say, 'Holy smoke! 
I could do digital recording at home! I'm a recording engineer!,' " said 
Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
"That scared the music industry into pushing legislation. But what that 
produced was that people got overexposed to DAT without having it readily 
available to them and they got bored with the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers who grumble about the latest upgrade in audio software each time they 
visit their local Wherehouse or Tower Records store will be grumbling into the 
21st Century, according to Palmquist, Barrett and others. Five years ago, 
prerecorded tape cassettes replaced the old vinyl LP albums as the top-selling 
item in record stores. Today, many stores have stopped stocking LPs altogether 
with the advent of compact discs, which are fast overtaking cassettes as the 
top-seller in record retail chains. 
</P>
<P>
"Four or five years from now, DAT players may replace cassette players the way 
that compact discs are now replacing LPs, but the recording industry will have 
to build up a library of pre-recorded tapes first," said Palmquist. "There's 
also the question of pricing. DAT machines now cost $2,500 to $10,000. If 
(Japanese manufacturers) go into quantity production, they could drop to the 
$1,000-$1,500 price range in a year or two." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it will be several years before DAT catches on to the same degree as 
compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the very long term, DAT will replace analog (conventional tape) 
cassettes," said Barrett. "But it won't happen any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that we hear all the time is people saying they're not going to buy 
a compact disc because DAT is coming out next year and the CD is a transitional 
product. Well, what isn't a transitional product? There's always going to be 
something in the works that will replace what you got. I mean, look at the 
eight-track tape. It was here and gone in ten years. I'd guess the CD will last 
another 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
And after that? 
</P>
<P>
"You'll be able to buy an album over the phone," said Barrett confidently. 
"You'll use your (computer) modem to call Warner Bros. records and punch in 
your credit-card code. They'll download the new Don Henley album into your 
computer and either bill you on your phone bill or over the computer on a 
monthly or quarterly basis."

HOME TECH: CRAVING A RERUN FIX? OLD SERIES APPEARING ON VIDEO

<P>
Don't worry if you don't remember "Amos 'n' Andy," "Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C." 
"Racket Squad" or "The Lone Ranger." 
</P>
<P>
These TV series probably don't mean a lot to the younger generation, but they 
were staples back in the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
And there are enough zealous fans of these old series to keep a small 
home-video market flourishing. "In this market, you do well to have sales of 
15,000-25,000 per cassette," said Arny Schorr of Rhino Video, which markets 
"The Lone Ranger," "Sgt. Preston" and "Death Valley Days." 
</P>
<P>
That's not much, considering companies routinely ship 300,000-400,000 copies of 
a hit movie. But, noted Blockbuster Video chain executive Ron Castell, "it's 
still a strong, steady market -- a cult market actually. It's small, but it's 
consistent." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the biggest titles include Paramount's "Star Trek" series and MPI's 
"Honeymooners" and "The Prisoner." Among the new releases: "Gomer Pyle" (Forum, 
$14.98 each), "Navy Log" (Forum, $19.98 each) and Kodak's three-cassette, 
$19.95-each series featuring highlights from Milton Berle's "Texaco Star 
Theater," one of TV's early hits. 
</P>
<P>
According to Schorr, the biggest audience for TV series on video is the over-35 
crowd who watched these shows when they were kids. "Watching these shows make 
them feel comfortable," he said. "It takes them back to a more innocent time, 
when things were less stressful and more fun." 
</P>
<P>
Generally video companies market one-hour cassettes, featuring a one-hour show 
or two half-hour shows. Some sell for $19.95, but most go for $10-$15. A few, 
like Concord's "Racket Squad" -- the early '50s cop series starring Reed Hadley 
-- sell for $8. 
</P>
<P>
While not pointing the finger at any company, Schorr indicated that some of the 
under-$10 tapes may have been recorded at the slowest speed, which saves tape 
and cuts costs. At that speed, though, the picture usually isn't very sharp. 
</P>
<P>
"On the very inexpensive tapes, the profit margin is so small that companies 
have to take shortcuts to make a profit," Schorr said, adding that Rhino's $10 
tapes are all duplicated at the fastest speed. 
</P>
<P>
There's been a lot of talk in the industry lately about TV programs on video -- 
generated mostly by two series, one that's suddenly available and one that's 
not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
The one just released, by CBS-Fox, is four cassettes -- each containing two 
episodes -- of "I Love Lucy" at $14.98. CBS-Fox hadn't planned to market these 
videos yet -- they were previously available only by mail order -- but they 
were rush-released because of the interest created by Ball's death in late 
April. 
</P>
<P>
The talked-about TV series not in home-video release is "Batman." With the 
country in the throes of Batmania, tapes of these '60 shows would be an instant 
smash. Also, their success might motivate some retailers to stock tapes of 
other TV series. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing tapes of TV series isn't easy. Video retailers, who mostly stock 
rental copies of hit movies, stock few -- if any -- TV series. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining the importance of getting the titles in the stores, CBS-Fox 
marketing vice president Bruce Pfander said: "When people buy tapes, research 
shows that half the purchasing decisions are made in the store. If the tapes 
aren't on the shelves, how can people make a decision to buy them? It's that 
simple." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, TV series videos have enjoyed a new outlet: mass 
merchandisers such as K mart and Target. 
</P>
<P>
Pfander estimated that 60%-70% of his company's TV series tapes were shipped to 
mass merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't as open to videos a few years ago. They want cassettes they can 
sell at $15 or less. The old TV series fit that price category. Video companies 
can get shelf space for their product that they can't get at video retail 
outlets." 
</P>
<P>
If you can't find a TV series at a video retailer or at a large store, you 
might check some of the major mail-order catalogues, traditionally a major 
outlet for these videos. MPI vice president Jaffer Ali said 40% of his 
company's TV series' business is mail order. 
</P>
<P>
Some series are in the public domain -- meaning any video company is free to 
market them without purchasing the rights. But often a company interested in 
marketing a series has to track down the owner of the rights and negotiate a 
deal. The rights of some TV series are owned by major video companies that just 
haven't bothered to put the shows on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Series due out in the next year: "Peter Gunn," the '50s detective series 
starring Craig Stevens and featuring the music of Henry Mancini (Rhino); 
"Twilight Zone" and "MASH" (CBS-Fox); "Dark Shadows," the campy horror soap 
(from MPI this fall). 
</P>
<P>
Now available on home video: "Amos 'n' Andy" (Earl Blair, Concord or Showcase 
Productions, $9.99-$29.95); "Dragnet" (Concord and Horizon Entertainment Group, 
$7.99 and $9.95); "The Avengers" (Concord and Horizon Entertainment Group, 
$9.99); "The Outer Limits," the '60s sci-fi anthology (MGM/UA, $14.95); "Secret 
Agent" (MPI, $19.95); "Medic," the '50s series starring Richard Boone (Concord 
and Horizon Entertainment Group, $7.99 and $9.95).

HOME TECH: VANGUARD RELEASES CHICAGO BLUES CD SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Otis Spann, Johnny Shines and Johnny Young never enjoyed the recognition that 
fellow bluesmen Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf or John Lee Hooker have among rock 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
But those and other bluesmen -- many of whom played in Muddy's bands over the 
years -- contributed greatly to the vitality of the Chicago blues scene and 
they teamed up in 1965 for a three-volume series of albums for Vanguard Records 
that showcased that spirit quite marvelously. 
</P>
<P>
The series -- "Chicago/The Blues/Today!" and produced by author-musicologist 
Samuel Charters -- has just been released on CD by Vanguard, now part of the 
Welk Record Group family. These recordings still offer a rewarding sample of 
the music of the era. Each volume is sold separately as part of Vanguard's 
budget "Mid-line" series. 
</P>
<P>
There is an intimacy and sense of spontaneity to the music that suggests it was 
recorded in the wee hours in a Chicago club. The absence of crowd noise makes 
it more likely that they took place in a studio. 
</P>
<P>
Volume 1 features five selections each by groups led by Junior Wells, J.B. 
Hutto and Spann, the extraordinary blues pianist. Volume 2 contains five 
numbers each from groups fronted by James Cotton (then known as "Jimmy") and 
Otis Rush plus four tunes featuring Homesick James Williamson. Volume 3 
consists of six numbers by Young's South Side Blues Band, four by the Johnny 
Shines band and three by Big Walter Horton's Blues Harp Band with Charlie 
Musselwhite. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE WAY: That David Bowie box set "Sound + Vision" coming from Rykodisc -- 
and containing unreleased material as well as hits and selected album tracks -- 
now has a scheduled release date: Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Howard's Santa Monica-based ICE newsletter, now in its second year as the 
nation's most helpful overview of CD software, reports that Geffen Records is 
releasing in September a John Hiatt compilation, drawn from the 
singer-songwriter's Geffen albums and MCA albums. 
</P>
<P>
PolyGram, meanwhile, is putting together a 20th anniversary edition of Derek 
&amp; the Dominoes' "Layla" for the fall of 1990, complete with a remix of the 
original album as well as some additional jams. 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET REVIEW: The O'Jays' "Collector's Items" (Philadelphia International) -- 
In such key tracks as "Back Stabbers" (1972) and "For the Love of Money" (1974) 
the R&amp;B vocal group matched the powerful combination of social observation 
and imaginative arrangements that the Temptations achieved in the late '60s and 
early '70s. But the O'Jays sometimes resorted to mushy sermonizing ("Family 
Reunion" and "Survival") and unduely lush arrangements. This budget package (a 
double album on a single, 74-minute disc) contains the highs and the lows.

PHILIP GLASS TO TEACH AT CAL STATE ARTS FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICOLE ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Composer Philip Glass will talk about his music and the collaborative elements 
of text and musical composition this weekend at Humboldt State as part of 
California State University's fourth annual Summer Arts Program. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the 20 Cal State campuses, the monthlong arts festival on the 
Arcata campus features professional performances and instruction by artists in 
the fields of theater, dance, music, visual arts, film/video, creative writing 
and new technology. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule includes workshops in chamber music, master classes in baroque 
flute, and demonstrations in sculpture firing and environmental dance. Guest 
artists include the Limon Dance Company, sculptor Italo Scanga, New York 
Metropolitan soprano Marvis Martin and saxophonist John Sampen. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 guest artists, faculty members and as many as 550 students have 
participated in this year's program. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been extremely well received this year. We're now attracting students 
from all over the country and the world," said Diane Vines, executive director 
of CSU's Summer Program. When the festival started in 1986, 350 enrolled, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vines points to the variety of disciplines offered and the small 
teacher/student ratio as reasons behind their success: "Our program is quite 
unusual. We offer something unique for people on the West Coast. We provide 
what most people do in one year in only one month. The interaction is more 
intense than a lecture or a workshop. Students also get a chance to study with 
people they never could have studied with otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
The Garth Fagan Bucket Dance group will perform Saturday and the Fine Arts 
Brass Quintet will play Sunday. The festival ends Aug. 5. NICOLE ATKINSON

Two men impersonating police officers held up a jewelry store on the French 
Riviera and escaped with at least $10 million worth of gems, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
They said the robbers cleaned out the elegant Van Cleef and Arpels boutique in 
Cannes on Wednesday, leaving behind only one necklace valued at $156,000. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men entered the shop at midday and presented a purported French 
police identity card, saying he was investigating a planned robbery on the 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
He was joined by a presumed colleague, who feigned a conversation with his 
associate and then produced a pistol and an Uzi submachine gun, ordering shop 
owner Jean-Pierre Quemard, his wife and five employees to the floor.

CENTENNIAL'S LEGACY: A BOOST FOR LOCAL HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert A. Slayton, an assistant professor of history from Chicago who hired on 
recently at Chapman College, was taken aback by what he couldn't find in 
libraries about Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Slayton, who says he was accustomed to libraries full of local history books 
and manuscripts, discovered "a real lack of historical writings" about Orange 
County. "These people are hungry for their history, and there just isn't that 
much of it here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Slayton and other historians in Orange County say things are looking up, 
thanks to the less spectacular side of the yearlong centennial celebration, 
which ends Tuesday, the county's official 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Eclipsed by fireworks shows, mass bicycle rides and music festivals, some of 
the Orange County Centennial Committee's efforts to stimulate local history 
research have had some success. Both historians and centennial organizers say 
that could wind up being the centennial year's longest-lasting legacy. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Sleeper, who has published numerous books and almanacs on Orange County 
history and is generally considered the dean of local historians, said much of 
the local history published during the year has been "largely pictorial, 
celebratory and sanitized in nature." 
</P>
<P>
"This past year's output should have been sufficient to collapse any coffee 
table, not to mention any potential reader," Sleeper said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there have been developments that have been widely praised in local history 
circles: 
</P>
<P>
* A huge bibliography listing virtually every local historical source in every 
library in Orange County is nearing completion and will be published by the 
Orange County Historical Society as a hard-cover book later this year. The 
bibliographical listings now cover 600 computer-printout pages, and a detailed 
index will cover perhaps 200 more. 
</P>
<P>
"If the bibliography fulfills its purpose, it will serve the next generation of 
researchers as an indispensable starting point for Orange County studies," 
wrote the compiler of the bibliography, Roger Berry, head of the UC Irvine 
Library's department of special collections. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the service to scholarship that the Orange County Historical Society 
wishes to provide as a legacy of the centennial," Berry wrote. 
</P>
<P>
* Chapman College and the county historical society, using a $2,000 grant from 
the centennial committee, held the Conference of Orange County History at 
Chapman in Orange last October, and it proved so successful it has become an 
annual event. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 professional and amateur historians plus local history buffs attended 
the sessions, and the college history department published a 300-page volume 
containing the approximately 40 historical papers submitted. Slayton said the 
college plans to continue holding the conference and publishing its papers. The 
second conference is scheduled for Sept. 23 and 24, free to all comers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's conference "was the first time all the academics and historical 
societies had come together in one place," Slayton said. "That gelling, that 
really sets up the basis for Orange County history in a somewhat more cohesive 
way," he said. "If you did this in New York or Chicago, it would be no big 
deal, but here it really fills an important niche. It's breaking ground, 
definitely." 
</P>
<P>
* KOCE, the public television station at Golden West College, is producing 
90-minute videotapes of its three-part history, "The Story of Orange County," 
for distribution to every county school. Included will be instructional 
materials that suggest class activities and field trips. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Metzger, president of Orange County Centennial Inc., said students were 
the primary concern of the committee's board of directors from the outset. Even 
before the centennial celebration began last July 31 with a fireworks show and 
a tour along county streets that attracted 13,000 bicyclists, the board had 
raised enough money to set aside $300,000 for scholarships, Metzger said. 
</P>
<P>
The community events and shows "were fun, very enjoyable, but I expect most 
people have forgotten about them now. That was a year ago. But people will not 
forget about our scholarship fund," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scholarship Fund 
</P>
<P>
The surplus from the committee's $1.6 million in revenues -- $1.4 million of 
which was donated by corporate sponsors -- will also go toward the scholarship 
fund, although Metzger declined to specify the amount. He said the committee's 
ending revenue and expenditure figures will be announced Tuesday, when a time 
capsule will be buried at the Old County Courthouse in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
According to Metzger, scholarships will be awarded to seniors graduating from 
an Orange County high school who have attended three of the previous four years 
in the county. Scholarships will be awarded according to academic and 
student-activities achievements and will not be based strictly on need. 
</P>
<P>
Scholarships may be used at universities, community colleges and technical 
schools, Metzger said. Students born in 1989, the centennial year, will be 
eligible for extra funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't build a monument. We don't have a statue of John Wayne or me or 
whatever. Our board wanted to contribute to things of lasting value," Metzger 
said.

STATE PANEL AWARDS COUNTY $124 MILLION FOR FREEWAY PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Transportation Commission on Thursday voted to spend $124.2 
million in federal funds next year for six crucial Orange County 
freeway-widening and interchange projects, most of them concentrated along the 
heavily congested Santa Ana Freeway corridor. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's action came during a meeting in San Francisco on how to divide 
about $177 million in federal funds that are earmarked for California freeway 
improvements next year. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Orange County captured the lion's share of the money comes as no 
surprise because its freeway projects are top priorities in the state's 
five-year plan for freeway improvements and were ready to go out for bid, said 
Bruce Nestande, a state transportation commissioner from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"The significance for Orange County is that the Orange County transportation 
program is still on schedule," Nestande said. 
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the commission's action on Thursday shouldn't leave the 
impression that Orange County no longer needs a half-cent sales tax increase to 
fund additional transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plan for the sales tax is built upon receiving these (funds) from the 
state and federal government" in the first place, Nestande said. 
</P>
<P>
The projects approved by the commission on Thursday are: 
</P>
<P>
* $47 million for the second phase of construction on the interchange between 
the Santa Ana and Costa Mesa freeways. The second phase would build direct 
connectors and so-called flyover ramps at the interchange to replace the loop 
ramps that now result in traffic backing up there, said Walt Hagen, chief 
deputy district director for project management in Caltrans's Orange County 
office. 
</P>
<P>
* $30 million for widening the Santa Ana freeway from the Costa Mesa Freeway to 
its confluence with the San Diego Freeway, known as the El Toro Y. The project 
would double the size of the current six-lane stretch to 12 lanes in all, said 
Hagen. Construction of the project could begin in January, he added. 
</P>
<P>
* As part of that widening project, Caltrans also will pay the county $6.8 
million to put in a drainage system upstream from the roadway to prevent 
flooding of the freeway, said Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
* $35.3 million for widening the Costa Mesa Freeway along a two-mile stretch 
from 19th Street to Wilson Street. Excavation of this part of the freeway was 
done 20 years ago, but the paving project was never undertaken, leaving the 
road width only three lanes in either direction, said Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
* $4.3 million for construction of on- and off-ramps from the Santa Ana freeway 
to Beach Boulevard in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
* $900,000 for additional sound walls along the San Diego Freeway, where 
Caltrans crews are finishing up new high-occupancy vehicle lanes. The new lanes 
will stretch 24 miles from the San Gabriel River Freeway to the El Toro Y.

OFFICIAL BOTHERED BY PRIVATE PLANNER'S PRESENCE ON BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The selection of a development firm planner to help interview finalists for the 
job of Costa Mesa's public services director gives the appearance of a conflict 
of interest, a City Council member charged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis said that choosing Malcolm Ross, an executive with 
C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons, a major development firm in Costa Mesa, to be a 
member of the interview board raises the potential for conflict because the 
firm will need to deal with the new public services director in the course of 
its business. 
</P>
<P>
Ross joined three public employees on the interview board for the position, 
which has not yet been filled. 
</P>
<P>
Genis said she will bring up the conflict issue at the council's Aug. 7 meeting 
in hopes of changing the city's policy to preclude similar situations in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really concerned about the kind of message this sends out to the job 
applicants for this position and other positions in terms of who really 
controls this town and (who) they have to keep satisfied," said Genis, who was 
elected last year on a slow-growth platform. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the message is you have to keep the developer pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Ross could not be reached for comment, but City Manager Allan L. Roeder denied 
that there was any conflict of interest in the selection of Ross to help 
interview finalists for the public services position, a job paying up to 
$75,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had varying individuals sit on different oral boards depending on 
qualifications," Roeder said. "I believe it's healthy for us to have people 
from the private sector involved in the interview process because we do 
interact frequently with the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
And including a member from private business along with three public employees 
on the interview board was important to give diversity of experience and 
expertise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he works for the development firm, Ross is a specialist in 
transportation issues with the city's Chamber of Commerce, Roeder said. Also, 
he said Ross was chosen as one of the panelists because the new public services 
director is expected to work extensively on improving transportation in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Roeder said the panel interviewed seven job hopefuls, which were then pared to 
three. He said the group made no decisions, only recommendations for him to 
consider in making the final selection in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
While the development firm and its executives and subsidiaries have given 
campaign contributions to council members, Roeder said, council members have 
"absolutely no involvement in who is on that panel." 
</P>
<P>
Roeder said he does not object to Genis' suggestion that the city change its 
policy regarding who is appointed to selection boards. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand her concern. Even if there is no actual conflict, I think she is 
concerned about the perceived conflict." If the rest of the council feels 
similarly, he said, "let's adopt a policy . . . and live by it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle said she does not see how the naming of Ross to 
the panel could present a conflict of interest. The council, she said, makes 
development decisions regardless of whether the Segerstrom firm deals with the 
new public services director. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither Mr. Ross nor the public service director have final authority on what 
happens in the city," she said.

TIRED OF LONG HOURS; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS, INTERNS STAGE UCI SLEEP-IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
About 20 medical residents and interns staged a "sleep-in" in front of UCI 
Medical Center on Thursday to protest the long hours -- sometimes 36-hour 
shifts and 100-hour workweeks that have been the traditional regimen of 
physician training. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can crash a car, I can certainly make mistakes in the operating room," 
said Gina Angiola, a third-year resident in obstetrics who joined with 20 other 
residents and interns in a short protest. Angiola said she fell asleep while 
driving home after a 36-hour shift in April and smashed into a utility pole in 
Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tom Nelson, an associate dean of the medical school, said he sympathized 
with the protesters and noted that the institution was moving toward 
controlling the number of hours they are forced to work. 
</P>
<P>
"An 80-hour week is what we're working toward and we are already there in all 
the specialties, except obstetrics and gynecology and surgery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Artificial Caps Called Difficult 
</P>
<P>
Placing artificial caps on the working hours of surgeons is difficult, Nelson 
said, because they often have to be at the operating table for many hours. 
</P>
<P>
"If a law says they have to leave after a 12-hour shift, it leaves no 
flexibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Brill, executive director of the California Assn. of Interns and 
Residents, said California should follow the lead of New York, which this month 
put regulations into effect that limit a single shift for young doctors to 24 
hours and a workweek to 80 hours, averaged over four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The University of California, the California Medical Assn. and the Hospital 
Assn. do not want this legislation," Brill said. "Last year they stonewalled 
it."

JURY CONVICTS MAN OF MURDER FOR RUNNING OVER VICTIM 3 TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dallas Keith Carter, the driver who killed a young man by running his car over 
him three times, collapsed into tears Thursday after a Superior Court jury 
returned a first-degree murder verdict against him. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 19, was so distraught that he had to be helped from the courtroom by 
deputy marshals after jurors left the courtroom in Santa Ana. Carter's mother 
crumpled to the floor in the hallway outside the courtroom and had to be helped 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Carter now faces a prison sentence of 25 years to life for the death of 
26-year-old Javier G. Sarabia of Garden Grove on May 15, 1988. Sarabia had been 
riding home from a family barbecue with his brother, Alex, on a motorcycle when 
Carter and two friends chased them down in a car and confronted them, 
brandishing a gun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Crescendo' of Violence 
</P>
<P>
The three men, who had been drinking heavily, had similarly harassed two other 
men earlier that night in separate incidents. Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey L. 
Robinson argued that Carter, who had the gun, was building up to a "crescendo" 
of violence and was going to hurt anyone who got in his way. Sarabia, unlike 
the earlier victims, had confronted the three men chasing him, which led to a 
scuffle with Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Carter ran over Sarabia with his car, then made U-turns to run 
over him twice more. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they could hear shouts from the car of "hit him again!" as 
Carter revved up the motor and aimed his car at the man lying on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
"It was that third time that did it," one juror said later. "If he hadn't 
turned the car back to go after (the victim) again, we would probably have 
returned a verdict of manslaughter." 
</P>
<P>
The jurors deliberated less than one full day. One woman juror, visibly shaken 
at Carter's reaction, began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Difficult Job 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan thanked the jurors for their service, and 
told them he knew what a difficult job theirs was. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to sleep well tonight," the judge told them. "We understand 
that. But we thank you for what you've done." 
</P>
<P>
After the jurors and Carter had left the courtroom, Sarabia's parents, Hector 
and Aurora Sarabia, stood up to thank the judge and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
"At least others who might ride motorcycles, if it's on business or just to 
ride, might be a little more safe, thanks to the justice done here," Hector 
Sarabia told the court in tears. 
</P>
<P>
He took exception to the defense's contention that his son had contributed to 
the confrontation with Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a skinny little kid," the victim's father said of his son. "He 
served his country (in the military). He was a good boy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helped Kill Case 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who testified on his own behalf, said that he was disoriented that 
night from drinking and wasn't sure what had happened. But he said that when he 
learned that he had run over Sarabia, his recollection was only that he might 
have run over a speed bump. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought he was a liar," a second juror said afterwards. "It was his own 
testimony that helped kill his case." 
</P>
<P>
The two men in the car with Carter, Ernest J. Busto, now 21, of Garden Grove, 
and Sergio Sanchez, now 19, of Santa Ana, both pleaded guilty to lesser charges 
of assault with a deadly weapon and are awaiting sentencing. Each could face up 
to four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ryan set Carter's sentencing for Aug. 18.

FOCUS IS ON INDIGENT; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY IS WARNED OF HEALTH-CARE CRUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Orange County is racing toward catastrophe in health-care services because it 
has placed more emphasis on buildings and highways than medical care, health 
care representatives warned the Board of Supervisors on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The emergency care system in Orange County is near collapse," said Peter 
Anderson, director of emergency medicine at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital 
and Medical Center. "The ability of hospitals, physicians, mental health 
clinics and county medical clinics to continue to offer medical care to the 
indigent is nearing its breaking point," he added. 
</P>
<P>
During a second day of public hearings on the county's $2.9-billion, 1989-90 
tentative budget, the supervisors listened to speakers who focused on the lack 
of health care for those without medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indigent Alcoholics Cited 
</P>
<P>
Jean Forbath, director and founder of Share Our Selves, a Costa Mesa 
organization that provides food, housing and medical assistance to the needy, 
said the current budget crisis left many low-income and poor people with few 
options. 
</P>
<P>
Among the programs suffering because of inadequate funding, she said, was one 
that provides treatment for indigent alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that an alcoholic indigent has the slightest chance of making 
it in Orange County," Forbath said. 
</P>
<P>
Chauncey Alexander, chairman of the United Way Health Care Task Force, told the 
board that the county's human-services funding has been inadequate compared to 
other areas. The task force is composed of representatives from 45 
organizations that concentrate on health-care issues. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said the budget for welfare payments and health care to the poor, set 
for $79.7 million, has dropped in the past 11 years from 32% of the total 
county budget to just 19% today. The funding for the health-care program has 
grown only 16% in the last two years, while other department budgets have grown 
from a range of 23% in education to 228% in public facilities, a category that 
includes street improvements and new roads, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
To compensate for this, Alexander said, the board should provide more money for 
health-care services from the county's discretionary funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to back them into a corner," Alexander said after the meeting. 
"But the county must know that there is a lack of money where it is most 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
John J. Rette, executive director of the Orange County Medical Assn., told the 
supervisors that they must show leadership on health-care issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to remind society of its responsibility in health care," Rette said. 
"We can't sit back and allow the system to collapse." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said that the board had to look at its resources 
and place more priority on health needs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been dealing with bricks. Now, we have to deal with bodies," Wieder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said during the hearing that other departments, 
such as the Environmental Management Agency, benefit from other revenue such as 
fees and fines. He pointed out that the social services and health care agency 
budgets depend almost entirely on state and federal funding, which the county 
cannot control. 
</P>
<P>
"What's critically important to know is that Orange County has been on the 
short end of the receiving line for federal and state funds based on the 
perception that the county is all affluent," Vasquez said.

CHAVEZ SHIFTS HIS GOALS SO HE CAN KEEP DREAM OF GLORY INTACT; 
</P>
<P>
BOXER LOST OLYMPIC CHANCE BUT PROGRESSES AS PRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ernie Chavez has learned all that's gold doesn't necessarily glitter. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two years, Chavez thought of nothing but winning the Olympic gold 
medal in Seoul. It was a dream that vanished in March of 1988 when he came up 
one victory short of making the Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not so much an end as it was a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez has turned his thoughts of gold into cash. He started his professional 
career last October and is unbeaten in five fights, winning three of them by a 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the 27-year-old welterweight will have his biggest bout to date as he 
faces Daryl Colquitt in the main event at the Marriott Hotel in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel fantastic, except for the usual nervousness that I have before a 
fight," said Chavez, a graduate of Westminster High School. "The workouts have 
been great. I'm in the best shape of my life. And I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
It has been a year of good fortune for Chavez. There are no scars -- physical 
or otherwise -- from his attempt to reach the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Chavez chatted about his love-at-first-sight meeting with his wife 
Emma, whom he married in April. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez also is excited and apprehensive. Not about his upcoming fight, but 
about moving from his apartment in Huntington Beach to a condominium in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said he will miss running on the beach. It has been a source of security 
ever since he was struck by a hit-and-run motorist while jogging in Beaumont, 
Tex., in 1986. He spent five days in the hospital with a broken leg and 
lacerated kidney. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little schizo about running on the street after that," Chavez said. 
"But we need the tax break. I'll run against traffic or maybe in the park. I'll 
adjust." 
</P>
<P>
There have been a lot of adjustments for Chavez this year. But going from 
amateur to pro -- even bachelor to husband -- has been easy for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I had the talent to fight as a pro and I wasn't going to let the 
opportunity slide by," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As an amateur, Chavez built an impressive record. He was the American Boxing 
Federation California welterweight champion from 1984 to 1988 and was the 
state's Golden Gloves champion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
He competed in Goodwill Games in Moscow in 1986, winning one of two fights. He 
has fought in several national tournaments and was considered one of the United 
States' top amateur welterweights. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of 1986, Chavez had a 26-7 record and was talking about not only 
competing in the 1988 Olympics, but of winning the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez even did a commercial for a beer company. This guy was on the move. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect he'll make either the U.S. Pan Am team (in 1987) or the Olympic 
team," Dick McCarthy, his trainer, said in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Chavez made neither. He concentrated his efforts on the Olympics, but 
it was a goal he would not achieve. 
</P>
<P>
He lost to Paul Vaden in the final of the western regional and went home. 
</P>
<P>
"I beat him up pretty good, but that doesn't count for much in amateur boxing," 
Chavez said. "He was a tall guy and he had a longer reach. He kept jabbing me 
and scoring points. By the third round, he began to tire. I creamed him." 
</P>
<P>
But the judges awarded Vaden the victory on points. Chavez accepted the 
decision, although he believed Vaden had received far more punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"He left the ring bloody," Chavez said. "He had the fat lip. He had the bloody 
nose. But under amateur rules, he had won the first two rounds and the fight. 
But I'd love to get him in a 10-round fight." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who began boxing at age 7, re-evaluated his career after the loss. At 
27, he was getting old for the amateur ranks and time was dwindling to start a 
professional career. 
</P>
<P>
He also realized that his skills were better suited for professional fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"I rely more on strength," Chavez said. "In amateurs, you score more points 
with the pity-pat style. You don't get extra points for beating someone up, 
unless you knock him out. 
</P>
<P>
"I debated a long time on what to do next. My age had a lot to do with the 
decision. Most guys are turning pro when they're 20." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez signed with Jackie McCoy, who manages several talented fighters. McCoy's 
stable includes Tony Perez, one of the top junior middleweight contenders. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 8, Chavez won his first professional fight in a four-round decision. He 
won his next, again in a four-round decision. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite his success, Chavez said McCoy was not pleased with his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me to relax in the ring, that I was too tense," Chavez said. "I never 
thought you could relax when you fight. It sounded crazy to me." 
</P>
<P>
But it worked. In his next fight, Chavez won on a fourth-round knockout. He won 
the next two fights with knockouts in the third and fifth rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I relax and fight now," Chavez said. "It sounds silly, but it works." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez pointed to the balcony at his apartment and a box of trophies. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what married life will do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the housecleaning, Chavez gives plenty of credit to Emma for his 
success as a professional. He said that she has given him stability, not to 
mention improving his diet. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to always eat out at fast-food places and sometimes get sick," Chavez 
said. "She's got me eating a healthy diet now. It's made me much stronger. She 
also takes care of the apartment, which gives me more time to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez works full time for a beer distributor in Garden Grove. He also plays 
guitar and sings, something he hopes to do professionally after he's done 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, a friend asked Chavez to come down to a bar in Anaheim and sit in 
on a set. Emma, who was visiting from England, was also there that night and 
literally knocked Ernie off his feet. 
</P>
<P>
That's something no boxer has been able to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw her when I walked in, but didn't do anything," Chavez said. "Some of my 
friends were telling me to go over and say hello to her, so I walked over and 
pretended to trip." 
</P>
<P>
Said Emma: "That's not true. He fell down and it wasn't on purpose. He tells me 
now it was intentional, but it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
What ever the circumstance, the two hit it off. They met the next day and, a 
little more than two months later, decided to get married. 
</P>
<P>
They originally planned to be married in September. But because Emma's visa was 
about to expire, they pushed the date up to April. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been great," Chavez said. "She runs with me and sometimes comes down to 
the gym to watch me train. She keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
Emma has no concerns about her husband's boxing. In fact, she's more worried 
about his motorcycle, which she says is going to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
"I know if Ernie got hurt boxing, he'd give it up," she said. "But he's not 
going to get hurt. He's quite good, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez figures he will continue boxing until he is in his early 30s. Then he 
will concentrate on music; he already has made five demonstration tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is something I can always do," Chavez said. "But right now, boxing makes 
me happy."

NASH RIVERA BRINGS HIS WIT AND WISDOM TO BASKETBALL COURTS AS SANTA ANA COACH

Anastacio (Nash) Rivera, the new varsity boys' basketball coach at Santa Ana 
High School, is doing what he does best -- teaching. He does it in the 
classroom, on the basketball court, any place will do, and anyone can be a 
pupil . . . even a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this, a perfectly good pen that somebody threw away," Rivera said, 
striding around the new campus. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is bend down and pick it up. Kids don't bend down enough 
anymore," he said, pulling out a piece of paper to test the pen. "This will be 
good for marking papers, because I have to grade a bunch of papers." 
</P>
<P>
He pocketed the pen. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera is part basketball ambassador, part philosopher -- a 54-year-old, lean, 
5-foot-10 package of energy and motivational phrases he bounces around like 
basketballs. 
</P>
<P>
After five years as an assistant to UCLA women's basketball Coach Billie Moore, 
Rivera says he has "recharged his batteries" for high school coaching and 
returned to Orange County. He is one of the hot topics at summer basketball 
leagues and tournaments among those old enough to have experienced his teams 
first-hand in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the guys know Nash is back," Westminster Coach Dick Katz said. "A lot 
of the younger coaches don't know what Nash did at El Dorado because that was 
15 years ago. A lot of those guys, back then they were 15. I don't think the 
name Nash Rivera has the same meaning as it does to a coach of my 
(generation)." 
</P>
<P>
What Rivera did was win Southern Section 2-A titles at El Dorado in 1974 and 
1975. El Dorado won five Orange League titles, made the playoffs nine times and 
had a 206-145 record Rivera's 14 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He then coached the girls' team at El Dorado for three years, taking them to 
Empire League title in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
During the '70s, Katz, then in his early 30s, was a sophomore coach at Orange 
and a junior varsity coach under Bob Schermerhorn at Canyon when Rivera was 
pushing the up-tempo game at El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more of an admiration thing . . . myself, an aspiring varsity coach, 
wanting to learn from the masters per se and Nash was one of them," said Katz, 
who has been Westminster's coach the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
What impressed Katz, he said, was the unselfishness of Rivera's players and the 
pressing style. "His teams back then did not have the super-dominant one 
player," he said. "They were never the kinds of teams you would shake and 
shiver to go in and play because of their athletic ability, but they were great 
teams . . . super disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
"The players always seemed to know their roles. They played full-court pressing 
and I love that. They could really run the break and just did a lot of smart 
basketball things on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"They were an excellent program, the finest in Southern California. Nash's kids 
would come in with blazers and cropped hair and sit in the bleachers as a team, 
show pride and class. The moment they walked in the gym, you knew they were a 
team to be reckoned with both on and off the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Schermerhorn, 46, was Canyon's varsity coach for five seasons. He competed 
against Rivera's teams when both schools were in the Orange League. "We used to 
have some real wars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"His teams would press after every basket. Offensively, they would run and 
shoot. That was a great league in those years. Gene Lloyd at Brea, Tex Wallace 
at La Habra. We all kind of played the same way, but Nash was kind of a step 
above all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Schermerhorn will coach at Riverside College this year. He finished last season 
as interim coach at Arizona State, leading the Sun Devils to a victory over 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
After that game, a reporter asked if it was the biggest victory of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her when I was at Canyon High School one year and we beat El Dorado at 
El Dorado and the kids threw us in the swimming pool," Schermerhorn said. "That 
was as big a win as beating UCLA this year to me." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Danley, who coached against Rivera for five years while at Anaheim High 
School, calls Rivera's return to the county exciting. 
</P>
<P>
"Nash was one of the forerunners and one of the outstanding coaches of the '60s 
and '70s and probably will be well into the 90s," Danley said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Heenan played on Rivera's championship teams at El Dorado. He went on to 
play at Cal State Fullerton and was drafted by the Golden State Warriors, but 
decided to play for Athletes In Action. 
</P>
<P>
Of all his coaches, he said he enjoyed playing for Rivera most. 
</P>
<P>
"Thinking back over all the years -- playing for all the coaches I've played 
for and being in real estate investment today -- the things that Rivera taught 
me have stuck with me the most of anybody. He used to say, 'Hard work and you 
can always hustle.' "If you made a mistake it was like, it's over with. Worry 
about correcting it later, but play your game now. That was the big thing." 
</P>
<P>
Who is this man who has earned the respect and admiration his players, his 
peers and John Wooden, UCLA's legendary former coach? Wooden sent Santa Ana 
Athletic Director Bill Ross a hand-written letter recommending Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera was an all-state guard in Raton, N.M., where he was born in 1935. After 
graduating from high school in 1953, he spent four years in the Air Force, 
mostly at March Air Force Base in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
He played for the base team and earned a grant to play at Chapman College, 
where he was team captain in his senior year, 1961. He graduated with a degree 
in physical education, spent a year coaching junior high school sports in 
Fullerton before going to Mater Dei, where he was the varsity basketball coach 
for three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He lives in Anaheim with his wife, Betty, and daughters, Elizabeth, 19, and Ann 
Marie, 13. 
</P>
<P>
He is the kind of coach who believes winning is a by-product of building 
character and self-esteem. He is a tireless optimist, a pied piper of 
basketball who instead of creating followers with music, does it with 
motivational phrases -- sometimes corny, sometimes cliched, often original and 
always catchy. 
</P>
<P>
Billie Moore said she hated to see Rivera leave UCLA, but understood his desire 
to run his own program. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of Nash from a player's standpoint," Moore said, "not just from 
teaching and enthusiasm, what you think of is he always has so many 
motivational little sayings," Moore said. "(That) and the sense of humor he 
has, if you have been around him very much, that is something you notice right 
off and that is what makes him unique." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera says he has seen how young people respond to repetitive catchy 
advertisements for fast-food restaurants, so he creates his own and motivates, 
cajoles, teaches, instructs, chastises, teases and bombards his players with 
them. It is his method of teaching his players the concepts and philosophies of 
basketball and life. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have time to do it right, when are you going to find time to do 
it over? 
</P>
<P>
 If it's worth doing, it is worth doing right. 
</P>
<P>
 Guts, determination and a bounce pass. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're good, you could be better. If you are better, you can be the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to prepare is preparing to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to play hard and smart. If you're only playing hard, you're playing 
dumb. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Nash is the coolest coach," said Althea Ford, a senior at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"If you made a stupid mistake and were really angry, he would say something 
like, 'Don't be bitter. Reconsider.' 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of his stupid sayings: We would be at practice and the ball 
bounces off your head. He would say, 'That's the way to use your head, Althea.' 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a big game or something you're looking forward to, he would say, 
'Like the monkey said when he got his tail caught in the door, it won't be long 
now.' " 
</P>
<P>
He got in his best jibes during preseason conditioning, Ford said. Rivera, who 
is in excellent physical condition, always led the pack during the Bruins' 3- 
and 5-mile runs. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing was, he would rub it in," Ford said. "He would come by and run with 
you for a little while and say, 'Are you doing all right? You're barely running 
faster than a dead person.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rivera coaches because he was born to coach. He is constantly showing, 
illustrating and demonstrating. 
</P>
<P>
"He is someone who just loves the game of basketball," Moore said. "I think he 
is probably happiest when he's teaching." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera can't say enough about how fortunate he feels to have landed a high 
school coaching job in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"In the coaching profession, I think I have the unique opportunity to come in 
contact with young people," Rivera said. "I think back to my coaches, the first 
coach I ever had when I was 12 years old, Coach Nuss. I think of the great 
influence that my coaches have had on me as coaches and as teachers. I really 
believe I have a unique opportunity to impart some carry-over values in life to 
these young people. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who choose to coach are unique, especially those of us who stay in 
it a long time. I think how many individuals have been helped through the 
vehicle of athletics. It is a great opportunity to teach a lot of things to 
these young people that are going to help them in the future. I know I have had 
so many individuals help me along the way." 
</P>
<P>
One saying stands out in the memories of those who know Rivera: It's tough to 
be important but it is more important to be tough. 
</P>
<P>
"By tough, I mean physically strong, being able to cope with changes life is 
going to bring, being able to cope with failure and cope with success," Rivera 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe we are here for a purpose, a reason. Mine is to touch these 
people, to help these people, to motivate them, to be a role model for them."

ALMANAC / SURVEY OF COUNTY OFFICE SPACE: CENTRAL COUNTY LEADS AIRPORT AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Central Orange County edged the John Wayne Airport area in net absorption of 
office space in the first half of 1989, according to a Grubb &amp; Ellis 
survey. The two regions accounted for 72% of the county's first-half total of 
1.7 million square feet of absorbed space, which the broker defines as square 
footage occupied by tenants minus square footage vacated. 
</P>
<P>
But while developers are busy providing new space in the airport region, 
hammers and saws are gathering cobwebs in the central county. Grubb &amp; Ellis 
said only 81,155 square feet of office space is under construction in central 
county, contrasted with 3.3 million in the airport region and 5.1 million 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of construction in central county will "further tighten the 
availability of space in the near term," said Tom Stilley of Grubb &amp; Ellis' 
Anaheim office. Still, the central county's 23% vacancy rate was higher than 
the countywide rate of 21%. The central county has been a focal point of office 
construction in recent years. And the broker said more than 5 million 
additional square feet of space is planned for that region -- nearly half the 
10.3 million square feet planned countywide.

A Connecticut investor, whose $9.50-per-share offer was rebuffed last week by 
Newport Electronics, has sweetened his offer for 35% of the company's stock to 
$11 per share. 
</P>
<P>
In documents filed Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Milton B. Hollander upped his original offer to increase his holdings in the 
Santa Ana maker of electronics instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander -- both individually and through a holding company called High 
Technology Holding Corp. -- currently owns 13% of Newport's shares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Board Rejects Offer 
</P>
<P>
On July 19, Newport's directors rejected Hollander's $9.50 per share offer in 
favor of two offers it has received from Sensor Control, a Sunnyvale maker of 
heat and pressure sensors. 
</P>
<P>
Sensor Control has made a tender offer of $9.75 for 43% of Newport's 
outstanding shares, said Norman Gray, a Newport board member. In addition, the 
Sunnyvale firm has made a merger offer to buy the remaining Newport stock at $9 
per share, if the tender offer goes through, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after rejecting Hollander's $9.50 offer -- but before the $11 offer 
was made -- Newport's directors voted to recommend that shareholders tender 
their shares to Sensor Control, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Action on New Offer 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't taken any action on (Hollander's latest) offer as far as modifying 
our recommendation," Gray said Thursday. "I'm not sure if it's a possibility. . 
. . Everybody's considering meeting. No meeting has been called yet." 
</P>
<P>
According to the filing, Hollander will seek the resignations of all of the 
company's current directors, except for Barret B. Weekes, Newport's chairman 
and president, if he gains control of the company.

DEALER IS ACCUSED OF ROLLS-ROYCE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES STROUSE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Costa Mesa car dealer was arraigned Thursday on felony charges that he bilked 
15 owners of Rolls-Royces and two banks out of more than $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Garry Concannon, 39, was charged with 15 felony counts, including grand theft 
and altering motor vehicle titles. He was unable to post $500,000 bail and was 
returned to Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Concannon nor his lawyer, Michael Kenney of Santa Ana, could be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"This looks like the largest case of automobile fraud in Orange County 
history," said Robert Duval, a senior special investigator for the California 
Department of Motor Vehicles. "We started getting complaints in March, and it 
just got bigger and bigger until we had received about 50." 
</P>
<P>
The car owners complained to police that Concannon had sold their cars on 
consignment without reimbursing them or that he used the cars as collateral to 
obtain loans, said Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Rob Smith. Only the 15 strongest 
cases were submitted for prosecution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Concannon obtained loans of more than $400,000 from Wells Fargo and American 
Interstate banks, using titles as security, said Theodore A. Johnson, a deputy 
Orange County district attorney prosecuting the case. He then forged 
applications for duplicate titles and sold the cars without telling the bank or 
the owners, according to the criminal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
From his stylish Red Hill Avenue office, Concannon offered to refurbish and 
sell the English cars on consignment at a premium, the complaint alleges. 
</P>
<P>
But he began having financial problems about three years ago when several 
business deals went sour, the criminal complaint states. He started peddling 
cars without telling the owners and took out loans on others that he didn't 
own, the complaint states. 
</P>
<P>
"He (persuaded) people to sign over the pink (title) slips," Johnson said. 
"When you sign off on one of those, you are very vulnerable to the seller." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that in one case, Concannon promised a Newport Beach man up to 
$160,000 for his 1988 Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible. Concannon then sold it 
to a Walnut Creek auto dealer for $140,000, but never turned over the proceeds 
to the original owner, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Concannon is claiming this was just poor business management, that he had 
no criminal intent, but I find that hard to believe," the prosecutor said. "The 
false applications to the DMV (for duplicate titles) show criminal intent." 
</P>
<P>
Concannon filed a bankruptcy petition in March and told creditors that he would 
pay them back after the business was liquidated. But bankruptcy documents show 
more than $2.5 million in debt and few assets. The court will sell four cars 
that still belong to Concannon later this summer, Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing on the case was set for Aug. 8.

A DIFFERENT KIND OF GROOVE; 
</P>
<P>
BLACK DAPHNE MELDS JAMES BROWN RHYTHMS, GUITAR POP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG ARELLANES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the members of Black Daphne seem to be enjoying their music more these days, 
James Brown deserves some of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
Their guitar-oriented pop has been hard to pigeon-hole, with influences ranging 
from Echo &amp; the Bunnymen to King Crimson, but lately the band has been 
taking some of its musical cues from the Hardest-Working Man in Show Business. 
</P>
<P>
Vocalist Kevin Utsler "got a James Brown CD, and it's just a whole different 
kind of groove than what we've played," bassist Wes Jackert said recently 
during an interview in a Long Beach cafe. "We're starting to write stuff more 
around a groove, concentrating more on the rhythm of a song." 
</P>
<P>
As tribute to "the godfather of soul," Black Daphne now covers Brown's 
popcorn-funk workout "Superbad." That in itself is something of a change in 
attitude for the band, whose on-stage demeanor until recently was rather 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a serious band, but we're not afraid to have some serious fun," bassist 
Wes Jackert said. "We're taking off our shoes -- but not literally." 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach-based quartet, which includes Jackert, lead guitarist Martin 
Beal, Utsler and his brother Keith, on drums, will headline a show Friday night 
at the Meadowlark Country Club in Huntington Beach. Also on the bill are Orange 
County bands Smiling Face Down and Redhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision to play more rhythmic stuff came out of a common affection for 
the groove," said Keith Utsler. When Black Daphne first emerged, both sound and 
lyrics had strong folk-music influences. Instead of scuttling their trademark 
ethereal guitar sound, however, they have rearranged their songs to feature 
tighter rhythm. "There's a very large dynamic range in the music. It's rock 'n' 
roll -- very catchy rock 'n' roll, but it incorporates so many different types 
of sounds," Beal said. 
</P>
<P>
The band has completed a second demo tape, the five-song "Across the River," 
and is trying to drum up interest in a record deal. "We've got some 
distributorship interest. We have some very tentative label interest. . . . If 
that doesn't work out, we'll save up enough money to put it out ourselves. It's 
very important that one way or another it gets out," Beal said. 
</P>
<P>
To raise money for the recording sessions, the band members collected musical 
equipment and miscellaneous cast-offs contributed by friends and fans and then 
held four garage sales at Jackert's parents' home. At the sales, Black Daphne 
would play acoustic sets on the back porch while shoppers perused the items. 
</P>
<P>
Once they raised the funds, the band found more than its share of trouble 
recording "Across the River." While in the studio, the tape recorder containing 
two days' worth of mixes "spontaneously combusted," rendering two songs 
unsuitable for their demo tape. "It'd be fun to put those out on a B-side, 
though," Kevin Utsler said. 
</P>
<P>
Black Daphne's members consider themselves "pop" musicians, but they use the 
term reluctantly because of negative connotations the term carries in a scene 
that values non-commercial attitudes. "We've never been a garage band. We've 
never been thrash or trashy. We've always done intricately put-together pop 
music," Beal said. 
</P>
<P>
The members of Black Daphne, who derive their name from a brand of Greek 
after-dinner wine, believe their increasing emphasis on the rhythm section will 
help set them apart from other local bands. "Everyone is concerned about vocal 
melody and relative tightness, but there aren't a whole lot of bands who can 
add a solid groove underneath that," Jackert said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a mean kind of groove. We play with a smile rather than a growl" Beal 
said, drawing the distinction between Black Daphne and such Southland funk-rock 
bands as the Red Hot Chili Peppers or Gherkin Raucous. 
</P>
<P>
Although the band's sound is evolving, Kevin Utsler hasn't changed his penchant 
for impressionistic lyrics, long the linchpin of the band. 
</P>
<P>
"I concentrate on conveying a certain attitude," Utsler said. "If a song has 
particular characters, like in 'Mrs. Baker' (a song that appears on both of 
Black Daphne's demo tapes) I try to sing in such a way that you have an idea of 
what is going on in the character's mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Black Daphne, Smiling Face Down and Redhouse play tonight at 9:30 at the 
Meadowlark Country Club, 16782 Graham St., Huntington Beach. Tickets: $6. 
Information: (714) 846-3391.

SNORTING FANS SIGNAL RETURN OF COMIC ALLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comedian Tim Allen -- something of a phenomenon in that many stand-up fans 
haven't even heard of him while others consider him one of the funniest comics 
around -- returns to Orange County for a stint at the Laff Stop that has been 
extended through tonight and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he's returning to the area might even surprise a lot of folks who 
didn't know -- or care -- that he performed on the "Five O'Clock Funnies" show 
in May at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are far more comedy fans unfamiliar than familiar with the 
Detroit comic, most probably didn't feel any compelling need to go see him in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, those who did attend not only knew Allen, but were nuts about 
him. He had barely taken the stage when many in the audience starting uttering 
his trademark pig snort. (We'll get to that shortly.) 
</P>
<P>
Even though it technically wasn't his show -- he was one of four comics sharing 
equal billing -- he drew a much more vocal, fervent response than some of the 
big-name comedians who have played the Celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
What's the explanation? 
</P>
<P>
First, he has developed pockets of support through selected television 
appearances, including the recent Rodney Dangerfield HBO special "Opening Night 
at Rodney's Place" and multiple shots on "Comic Strip Live," a nationally 
syndicated show filmed at Igby's in Los Angeles -- as well as heavy radio 
exposure on KLOS-FM's weekday feature, "The Five O'Clock Funnies." 
</P>
<P>
The other explanation: Allen is refreshing and very funny. Early in his 
performances, he sets up the premise that "men are pigs," punctuated with a pig 
snort. He then extends this notion -- and the snort, though it ends up sounding 
more simian than porcine -- throughout the remainder of his show. 
</P>
<P>
He also pairs this idea with another running theme: that men love tools, 
sometimes to the extreme of rewiring everything from the vacuum cleaner to the 
garbage disposal to make them more powerful. The approach is unusual, amusing 
and is rapidly winning Allen new fans. At this rate, it may not be long before 
Tim Allen becomes a household name. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Allen appears tonight at 8:30 and 10:30 and Saturday at 8 and 10 p.m. at 
the Laff Stop, 2122 S.E. Bristol, Santa Ana. Show times: 8 and 9:45 p.m. 
Tickets: $12.50. Information: (714) 852-8762.

CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS SPEND A WEEK HAVING FUN AT 'A MAGIC PLACE' JUST 
FOR THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Every summer, Bob Crabb tells himself he's not going back to summer camp. And 
every summer, he goes anyway. 
</P>
<P>
For 18 years, Crabb has volunteered as a counselor at the Cystic Fibrosis 
Summer Camp, where children ages 6 and older stricken with the incurable 
disease can experience a carefree week away from hospitals and painful 
reminders they are different from other youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a magic place," Crabb said. "It's not like a normal summer camp because 
life is more precious. Most of these kids don't make it past the age of 18." 
</P>
<P>
That magic keeps Crabb and other volunteers returning to camp year after year 
-- many sacrificing their own vacations to be with the children. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think, 'I can't do that anymore,' " said Crabb, a Seal Beach 
resident and teacher at Santiago High School in Garden Grove. "The outside 
world starts taking precedence. I say, 'I can't go. I have to paint my house.' 
Then I come anyway, and I remember why I came." 
</P>
<P>
He remembers that most of the children look forward to the camp all year long. 
He remembers, too, that this is the one week they can be with others who share 
their problems. They won't be teased because they have skinny legs and they're 
not as big as healthy children. They won't have to explain why they cough so 
much or take so many pills. 
</P>
<P>
For one week, ending last Saturday, the children could say, "Who cares if I'm 
sick?" They were "normal," thanks to the efforts of Crabb and about 30 
volunteer counselors and 10 unpaid doctors, nurses and physical therapists. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Kaup of Anaheim, a 9-year-old with long red hair, has come to the 
camp for four years. 
</P>
<P>
"The others understand me, and they're strange like me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, her reasons for wanting to attend are the same as any 9-year-old's: 
</P>
<P>
"You get to see your best friend and get away from your parents." 
</P>
<P>
About 80 children, most of them patients at Childrens Hospital of Orange 
County, traveled by bus along a narrow dirt road to Lazy W Ranch Methodist 
Camp, tucked away in the shrub-covered hills of Hot Springs Canyon in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon they assembled on the concrete tiers of a small amphitheater for 
the "anything goes" competition. Crabb stood before them, looking perfectly 
ridiculous in a blue swim cap he had pulled over his bald head. The children 
hooted and hollered. 
</P>
<P>
Crabb had invented a game, the kind of silly activity campers love. The object: 
Land water balloons on a nail protruding from the top of the swim cap. Campers 
took turns wearing the cap and being pelted with balloons by their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
The children screamed with each direct hit. Except for an occasional cough, 
there was no sign of the illness that dominates their lives the rest of the 
year. Then Crabb and camp director Bob Cook turned the balloons on the 
audience. Boys and girls scattered. Later, Crabb hugged a small boy who was 
trampled in the melee. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to get them away from the hospital, to get them sort of dirty," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the camp was no different from any other. The children swam, 
played games, made crafts and sang around campfires. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have a schedule," said Bob Flanagan, a writer and actor from Hollywood. 
Flanagan, 37, has cystic fibrosis and has been a counselor since he was 18. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's organized chaos. It's just a hanger to hang our silliness on." 
</P>
<P>
Music played throughout the camp at all hours. Jimmy Buffett blared through 
speakers during crafts time. 
</P>
<P>
Crabb, Flanagan and a few volunteers formed their own band, which jump-started 
campers awake in the morning. At night, they chose one girl from each cabin and 
serenaded her, all the while shining a flashlight in her face. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers say spontaneous activities work best. At the camp's traditional 
Wednesday night dance, Flanagan once rented a tuxedo and a limo. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1984, when Los Angeles played host to the Olympics, the 
counselors decided to hold their own games. Some campers wore togas, and a boy 
named Todd who died this year was chosen to carry the torch into camp. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a joke at first, but he took it seriously," Crabb said. "I can still 
see him coming over the hill with his oxygen tank on, holding the torch." 
</P>
<P>
Moments like these keep volunteers coming back, summer after summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Most feel their effort really counts," said Dr. Ivan Harwood, professor of 
pediatrics and director of the cystic fibrosis center at the University of 
California Medical Center in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood has volunteered for the camp's medical staff for 15 years. "The kids 
really look forward to these camps. It's the one time of year when having CF is 
normal. . . . Yesterday, a little boy walked up to me and asked, 'Do you have 
CF?' When I told him I didn't, he said, 'Then what are you doing here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Away from their parents and friends, children speak more freely about their 
illness and death. Said Harwood: 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I stood behind two 10-year-old boys as they watched a busload of 
children pull into camp. I heard one of them say, 'I wonder if so-and-so will 
be here?' And the other one said, 'No, he won't. He was too sick last year.' 
Camp is the one place they can talk about these things." 
</P>
<P>
Angela Melick of Corona, an 18-year-old with large blue eyes, finds the campers 
support each other. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like family," she said. "Yesterday, I was talking with one of my friends 
who had a gallbladder operation. I might have to have one, too, so she told me 
what it was like. We can talk about our problems with each other." 
</P>
<P>
Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease, affecting about 1 in 1,600 people, 
Harwood said. It primarily attacks the digestive tract and lungs, causing 
severe respiratory infection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like having permanent pneumonia," Crabb said. 
</P>
<P>
Some campers rebuild their strength by inhaling oxygen from a tank at night, 
and one child wore a tank at all times. 
</P>
<P>
They take medication that helps their bodies digest food, and a few get 
nourishment through an intravenous tube. 
</P>
<P>
Before each meal, a bell rang and campers filed into a makeshift medical center 
where the staff had filled a table with shoe boxes. Their parents had packed a 
week's worth of medication into the boxes. Children picked a red or blue cup 
filled with their "meds." When having cystic fibrosis is the norm, they don't 
feel embarrassed about taking pills the way they do in school, the kids said. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers don't disguise the reality of the disease, however. Some campers 
have had brothers and sisters who have died. 
</P>
<P>
On the last night of camp, they met around the campfire for an unusual ritual. 
A counselor read the names of former campers who died during the year. 
Sometimes they toss a songbook or poem into the fire in the children's memory. 
Everyone cried. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the counselors questioned whether the week should end so sadly. But 
they and the children find the ritual uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the older boys who has since died said, 'This is the only way you know 
you'll be remembered. You can't not do it,' " Harwood recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Yet campers also learn they have a future from adult counselors who have cystic 
fibrosis. At 37, Flanagan has lived longer than most. His sister died of the 
disease 10 years ago at the age of 21. 
</P>
<P>
"I give them a sense of hope because I've been around so long and they see I'm 
living a full life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of more aggressive treatment for the disease, some victims' life 
expectancies have been extended to 30, although most still die in their teens. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were teen-agers, there was nobody much older than us" who had CF, said 
volunteer Jennifer Frantom, 29, a Rancho Cucamonga resident and office manager 
at the Chino airport. 
</P>
<P>
"And the few who were around were too sick to get around much. The attitude 
was, 'You'll die by the time you're 25.' " 
</P>
<P>
Frantom watched three girls sitting at a picnic table braid friendship 
bracelets from colored string. By her presence, she lets the girls know they 
can have a longer life. 
</P>
<P>
"They're always surprised to find older people with CF. It's also good for 
parents to see us. It's a big boost. We're not dead and we're in our 30s." 
</P>
<P>
Frantom works year-round to help raise the $20,000 in private donations to run 
the camp. There's no charge to the kids. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a choice between a free trip to Hawaii or here, I'd come here," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The medical staff works with cystic fibrosis children all year, and yet they 
volunteer for camp because it allows them to be around the children when 
they're not sick, Harwood said. Seeing them having fun "reduces burnout in 
professional people." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most loyal volunteers, however, have no ties to cystic fibrosis 
outside camp. Cook, the camp director, works as vice president of a computer 
cable company. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great time," he said simply. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Schachtschneider travels here from West Germany to be a counselor. She 
began volunteering 17 years ago when she heard about the camp from a mutual 
friend of Crabb. She returned this year, even though she now has two children 
and is pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"They're part of my family," she said, watching two boys go at each other with 
water pistols. "Here, they can be open. They can be wild. It's a chance for 
them to be themselves because a lot of them are really sheltered." 
</P>
<P>
Crabb served as the camp's first director in 1970 after Dr. Gene Litwer, a 
private physician in Santa Ana, decided children with cystic fibrosis and their 
parents needed a vacation and helped organize the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Crabb's 21-year-old daughter, Anjie, and 17-year-old son, Kyle, accompany him 
to camp. Anjie, now a counselor, began coming when she was 6. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted CF," she said. "The kids were treated so special, and I got 
teased for not having it." She quit her job as a waitress to make it this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an addiction," she said. "You get so attached to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The children count on the volunteers' addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Said Flanagan: "I have a feeling camp prolongs their life."

AUTHOR'S SEMINARS HELP PARENTS IN COPING WITH STRESSES OF THE '80S

<P>
"It's never been harder to be a teen-ager or the parent of a teen-ager than it 
is in the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
With this statement, Peter Buntman began his recent seminar, "Parent's Survival 
Course," at the Yorba Linda Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
In the spacious community room sat anxious and eager parents of teen-agers. 
Some were seeking answers on how to handle their trouble-making children, while 
others were there simply because they cared enough to be. 
</P>
<P>
This free seminar was one of 81 that Buntman puts on during the year throughout 
Los Angeles and Orange counties in affiliation with the Community Educational 
Program sponsored by College Hospitals of Cerritos and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Buntman is a co-author of a self-help book entitled "How to Live With Your 
Teen-Ager -- A Survivor's Handbook for Parents" and is a licensed clinical 
social worker who has been counseling teen-agers and their parents for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
During his seminar, Buntman insisted that being a teen-ager in today's society 
is more difficult than it used to be because of the prevalence of drugs, peer 
pressure concerning sex and the increasing number of single working parents. 
</P>
<P>
He gave examples of typical adolescent behavior, saying it is quite common for 
a teen-ager to not want to be with his parents, "to have this incredible 
ability to be completely selfish and to have a need to rebel." 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager's effort to rebel is the most important behavior for a parent to 
understand, according to Buntman, who grouped rebellious behavior into unsafe 
and safe categories. 
</P>
<P>
Unsafe rebellion, he said, manifests itself in such activities as cutting 
school, not working to ability in school, involvement with drugs, sexual 
activity, any criminal involvement and not listening to parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Safely rebelling includes being messy and dirty, wearing your hair the way 
your parents don't like, wearing clothes your parents don't like or listening 
to music your parents don't like," Buntman said. 
</P>
<P>
He gave an example of a safe rebellion from his own experience, remembering 
when his daughter went through a phase of painted acrylic nails that went from 
red to green to yellow to black. "She knew I hated the black ones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buntman stressed the importance of knowing the difference between the two types 
of rebellion. "What I see happen so often is that parents come down so hard on 
the safe ways to rebel, they literally force their kids into unsafe rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
To handle the resulting problems, Buntman advises: "Parents need to be firm, 
strict, set limits and hold to their limits." 
</P>
<P>
As punishment for going beyond these limits, Buntman recommends parents start 
by taking away privileges -- access to a car or the phone -- for a period of 
time. If this doesn't work, grounding should be the next step, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And should grounding not persuade the teen-ager to cease and desist, Buntman 
suggested taking the door off its hinges. Yes, the teen-ager's bedroom door. 
And if all else fails, then everything in the teen-ager's room should be taken 
out, except such necessities as the bed, a couple of changes of clothes and 
books, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But where do you store the furniture and personal belongings? Anywhere, Buntman 
said -- the garage, the attic, the neighbor's garage . . . . "You will be 
amazed at how helpful neighbors you hardly know can be," he said. "If they have 
teen-aged children, too, they will sympathize with you." 
</P>
<P>
Buntman said there are five skills that parents need in order to have a better 
relationship with their teen-aged children: 
</P>
<P>
First is building their adolescent's self-esteem. Research conducted at the 
Center for Family Life Enrichment Inc., where Buntman works, showed that 
parents, on the average, give their teen-ager one half of one compliment per 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"Give your kid one compliment every day," Buntman advises. "If you do just 
this, you will be doing 14 times better than the national average." 
</P>
<P>
The next skill is called "attentive listening." Parents need to listen to their 
teen-agers without being judgmental or critical because by being those things, 
they are putting their child down, Buntman said. 
</P>
<P>
Third, instead of getting angry and resorting to name-calling, the parent 
should use the "I" message. 
</P>
<P>
The formula is simple: "I" plus "how you feel" plus "describing the situation 
without using the word 'you.' " An example: "I get angry when people say 
they'll do something and then they don't." This, Bunting says, is an 
alternative to: "You are so stupid -- how many times must I tell you to clean 
your room? If I told you once, I've told you a hundred times!" 
</P>
<P>
The final two skills, Buntman said, are often referred to as "T&amp;T." The 
national average for time -- the first "T" -- spent talking alone between 
parent and teen-ager is seven minutes per week. The second "T" stands for 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
"Spend seven minutes a day talking to each of your kids," Buntman advised, "and 
in some way, touch your kids every day." 
</P>
<P>
Buntman also warned parents about teen-age suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"You always will see some kind of a warning sign," he said. These signs range 
from a noticeable change in eating or sleeping habits; withdrawal from friends, 
family and regular activities; violent rebellious behavior and radical 
personality changes to the more obvious, such as running away or putting 
affairs in order by giving away personal belongings. 
</P>
<P>
There may also be verbal warnings, such as "life isn't worth living," "I'd be 
better off dead" or "I can't go on anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Another possible sign may be when a teen-ager is depressed for a very long 
time, possibly several months or even years, and then suddenly becomes 
cheerful. "He may have made a decision to check out on us," Buntman warned. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many things in life for which you get a second chance," he said. "If 
the kid is on drugs, he can quit. If the kid drops out of school, he can go 
back. But if the kid kills himself, that's it. There's no second chance." 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you see a (warning) sign in any kid, immediately rush him to a 
therapist to see how serious it is. Suicide is a major problem for teen-agers. 
To a therapist who does nothing but work with teen-agers all day, this is 
scary."

HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: HIGH LIFE: A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
BICYCLE HELMETS CAN SAVE LIVES BUT KIDS RESIST THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year, more than 600 children under age 15 die in bicycle-related crashes, 
research shows. And in more than 80% of the cases, head injuries are involved. 
Still, bicycle helmets remain a hard sell. Fewer than 5% of young bikers wear 
them, several studies suggest. 
</P>
<P>
To find out why, Boston researchers interviewed 42 fourth- through 
sixth-graders. Their findings were published recently in the American Journal 
of Diseases of Children. The students say they often don't associate head 
injuries with bike crashes, thinking more often about the possibility of cuts, 
scrapes and limb injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Few students expressed positive attitudes about wearing helmets. They said 
others would make fun of them or think they're "a weirdo." But their comments 
changed when asked what they thought of other helmet-wearing children, whom 
they called smart, safety-conscious or good. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the most significant findings were that children did not hold negative 
attitudes toward other children who wear helmets and that children were not 
resistant to the idea of mandatory helmet use," says Jonathan Howland, a Boston 
University School of Public Health assistant professor and study co-author. 
"Parents and pediatricians need to tell kids it's OK to wear helmets, that 
other kids are going to secretly admire them." 
</P>
<P>
Other advice on helmet purchase and wear: 
</P>
<P>
Give the child a say. In the Boston study, certain colors and styles were 
preferred. Black was hot, as were teardrop styles seen in the movies; white 
helmets were out. 
</P>
<P>
For maximum safety, pick a hard over a soft shell, suggests Dr. William Boyle, 
a pediatrician in Hanover, Mass., and a member of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics' Committee on Accident Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipate savings soon. The price on children's bike helmets, now ranging from 
$17 to $50, may decline in the next few months, partly because of promotions by 
manufacturers and consumer groups, Boyle says. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was an unwanted baby when I saw my bath toys were a toaster and a 
radio."

SINGLE LIFE: HARRY, SALLY KNOW IT -- THAT AT BEST, LOVE IS OFTEN RANDOM, 
UNEXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, Susan Christian is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
Can a man and a woman be best friends -- platonically? If so, can that once 
passionless friendship develop into romance? Does sex ruin friendship? Does 
marriage ruin sex? Unless you devote every single (as in "unwed") moment to 
finding a mate, might you end up spending the rest of your life knowing that 
your spouse is married to another person? 
</P>
<P>
Such are the questions posed by director Rob Reiner's new film, "When Harry Met 
Sally . . . ." And, judging by audience reaction, they are recognizable 
musings. After waiting in long lines, viewers laugh and applaud throughout the 
movie -- cheering as well as grimacing over the familiar chords that it 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Why, by all appearances, do so many people embrace this latest tale of modern 
romance? "Since time began, we were made to find the right person," said Tustin 
psychologist Amy Stark. "There is a lot of pain involved in that process, so it 
is something everyone can relate to: not having a date on New Year's Eve, 
longing for a past relationship, having your feelings hurt by a lover. The 
movie captured all of that." 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of singles who saw "When Harry Met Sally . . ." last weekend in 
Newport Beach offered various theories about its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the underlying question: Can men and women be friends without -- as 
Billy Crystal's character, Harry, referred to it -- "the sex thing" 
interfering? Most of the singles said, "maybe." 
</P>
<P>
However, 39-year-old Bob Clark pointed out, girls and boys are conditioned as 
early as junior high "to view each other sexually." 
</P>
<P>
"When you are a teen-ager, you are under a lot of pressure to date rather than 
spend time in groups of mixed company, where you can learn to be comfortable 
with the opposite sex," said the Laguna Beach carpenter. "In high school, 
dating is a matter of conquest, rather than of getting to know and appreciate 
the opposite sex. That carries into adulthood, and sometimes people don't have 
an understanding of how the opposite sex thinks until they're already married." 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough for men and women to be friends," said Corona del Mar resident 
Ticole Richards, 19, a sports equipment buyer. "A male friend and I became so 
close that it seemed like the natural next step in our relationship was 
intimacy. We tried it, and it didn't work. There was some awkwardness for a 
while afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still good friends, but our friendship changed a little. But I still 
feel that I can talk with him about boyfriends and whatever. It's really 
helpful to get a man's point of view, instead of always getting a female 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, Richards added, friendship would be the best way to begin a romance. 
"If it did work out, you would have the perfect relationship," she said. "You 
would understand the other person in a different way. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the movie, they love each other's faults as well as their good 
characteristics. When people date, they get an idealized image of the other 
person. But sooner or later, real life sets in, and they find out each other's 
idiosyncrasies, which we all have. I think that's what pulls people apart." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Sucher, 31, a film director in Mission Viejo, believes that men and women 
can foster close friendships. But, he said, "I think if people have been 
friends for a long time it would be hard to make the transition to a sexual 
relationship. You'd be taking the risk that you might ruin the friendship. It 
would be a lot harder to end a relationship that started out as a friendship 
because you have so much invested in it." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the movie-goers agreed, the film made a positive statement about 
marriage. "Everyone in the movie sought to be married," observed Yorba Linda 
resident Carolyn Phillips, 47, a divorced mother of two. "Remember the scene 
where Carrie Fisher (Maria) turns to her boyfriend (Jess, portrayed by Bruno 
Kirby) and says, 'Tell me I'll never have to be out there (in the dating world) 
again'? 
</P>
<P>
" 'Out there' says it all. 'Out there' is having to be strong by yourself; 'in 
there' is having someone be strong with you. 'Out there' is a lonely place to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
In the film, Sally expressed her and her ex-boyfriend's fear that marriage and 
children would hinder their romance. Footloose and fancy-free, she said, the 
couple could fly off to Rome on the spur of the moment. Then one day Sally 
realized that they had never flown off to Rome impulsively, and decided that 
she would trade her freedom for the responsibilities -- and joys -- of a 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, a marketing consultant, reflected on that scene: "When you have 
children, you aren't missing anything -- you're giving. If you want to acquire 
children the way you would acquire a BMW, they'll get in your way. Certainly my 
priorities changed when I had children, but my kids were the best thing that 
ever happened in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Also a divorced parent of two children, Bob Clark said that children and 
marriage do indeed transform a relationship. "Marriage takes away some of the 
mystique of dating," he said. "You can fall into routines and bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids keep you busy right up until bedtime. You're tired from work, so, sure, 
children have an effect on your sex life. Couples have to plan special times to 
be together." 
</P>
<P>
Even with its shortcomings, Clark said, he plans to try marriage again -- with 
his live-in girlfriend. "Just living together indefinitely, like Meg Ryan and 
her ex-boyfriend did (in the movie), is not a lofty goal," he said. "If you can 
instead make a commitment to shoot for 50 years together, it gives you much 
more permanence in your life." 
</P>
<P>
Will the fact that Harry and Sally exchanged vows after a close friendship make 
their marriage last? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably not," said Martin Sanchez, 41, a manufacturer's representative in 
Mission Viejo. "They were both unconventional people, so why would they have a 
traditional marriage?" 
</P>
<P>
"Given the two personalities, it's always going to be a stormy relationship," 
Clark said. "But they'd done their best to explore each other's personalities, 
both the good and the bad traits, so I feel they have a good chance of staying 
together for a while." 
</P>
<P>
That Harry and Sally recognized one another's quirks -- and fell in love anyway 
-- made an impression on Phillips. "In romantic relationships, we are very 
afraid that if someone knows us well, they will leave us," she said. "So we try 
to stay on the surface. Especially here in Southern California, appearances and 
material possessions are important. But that's not where love is." 
</P>
<P>
Brief conversations with longtime married couples are interspersed throughout 
the film, with each pair reminiscing about how they met. Therapist Stark saw 
the device more as a salute to the randomness of love than to marriage itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Before she met her boyfriend, Carrie Fisher (Maria) had a desperate quality to 
her that made her unappealing," Stark said. "She had the Rolodex full of men's 
names; she was always trying to make something happen rather than just let it 
happen. I see so many people like that, approaching love like they would a 
business deal. But the moment Maria relaxed a little, the moment she wasn't 
looking, she met someone. 
</P>
<P>
"The statement I think the movie makes is that relationships are random. You 
can try and try and try to meet the right person, and then the one time you're 
not trying, there they are."

Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber of Akron, Ohio, reported a second-quarter profit of 
$27.1 million, compared to a $134.9-million profit in the same period a year 
ago. The company said its profit was affected by the sale of its South African 
subsidiary, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $52 million. Proceeds from 
this sale are expected to total $41 million when the sale is completed in the 
third quarter.

"Oh! Calcutta!" will close Aug. 6 after a Broadway run of 5,959 performances by 
the nude revue, executive producer Maria Di Dia announced today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an exciting ride, and I'm sad to see it end," Di Dia said. "But I'm 
also happy because no one ever expected this show to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
The current edition of the show opened Sept. 24, 1976, at the Edison Theater. 
It was the second major incarnation for the revue, which premiered in 1969 at 
off-Broadway's Eden Theater, moved in 1971 to Broadway's Belasco Theater and 
ran there until the following year. The show has been seen by more than 85 
million people in 18 countries and has grossed more than $350 million.

The owner of a janitorial service was gunned down in the driveway of his Van 
Nuys home and Los Angeles police were searching today for one of the victim's 
employees, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Norris, 49, was shot to death about 10 p.m. Thursday after he walked 
out of his garage and spoke briefly to a man in a car that stopped in front of 
his home in the 7100 block of McLennan Avenue, detective Jim Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
Norris was hit once in the chest by a gunshot and died on the driveway. The 
car, a 1971 Ford station wagon, sped away. Descriptions of the car and suspect 
provided by neighbors led police to begin looking for an employee of Norris' 
firm, which cleans such businesses as office buildings, restaurants and bars. 
</P>
<P>
Vojtecky said no motive for the shooting was known.

A three-month undercover investigation has resulted in the arrests of a 
supervisor and four workers at the McDonnell Douglas aerospace plant in 
Huntington Beach on suspicion of dealing drugs, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach narcotics officers worked in conjunction with McDonnell 
Douglas security on the investigation that resulted in the arrests, which were 
made July 20 but not disclosed until today, police said. All the suspects were 
arrested at work except one, who was taken into custody at her Stanton home, 
Police Lt. Ed McErlain said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation "was a result of a combination of (company security 
officials) coming to us with the suspicion there could be a problem, coupled 
with intelligence information we received," McErlain said. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the supervisor arrested as Robert Paul Hawes, 31, of Anaheim, 
who was arrested on suspicion of selling cocaine. Workers arrested were James 
Michael Todd, 28, of Long Beach and Robin Michelle Vaughan, 26, of Stanton on 
suspicion of selling cocaine and David Henry Munoz, 27, of Los Angeles and 
Judith Kay Winslow, 47, of Garden Grove on suspicion of selling marijuana.

BUSH TO FIGHT HOUSE CUTS IN ARMS BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush today deplored votes by the House of Representatives to cut four 
major defense systems but predicted that his view will prevail by the time 
Congress finishes work on his military budget. 
</P>
<P>
At a wide-ranging news conference, Bush adopted a soft-toned approach to the 
House's defense bill slashes, but he said it was "not the House's most 
memorable moment." 
</P>
<P>
The President said he will not accept further cuts in the "Star Wars" budget to 
protect his other defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiations Noted 
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to negotiate with the Soviet Union without as many cards in my 
hands as possible," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also said he still has confidence in William Lucas, his embattled nominee 
to become chief civil rights enforcer in the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that much of the criticism (against Lucas) is pure gut American 
politics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he was working hard to save the nomination. Critics say Lucas lacks 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
And on a third controversy in Congress, Bush disputed critics who contend that 
his attempt to amend the Constitution to prevent the desecration of the 
American flag will wind up weakening the rights of all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I feel so strongly that a very carefully drawn amendment can solve this 
problem that I don't worry about it," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say if he would sign a Democratic bill that would make the act 
of destroying the flag illegal but stops short of making it part of the 
Constitution. A House committee approved such a measure Thursday with 
bipartisan support even though many Republicans agreed with Bush that a 
constitutional amendment is the proper solution. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he felt no "disrespect" for members of Congress who want to go the 
legislative rather than the amendment route to deal with the flag desecration 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called the news conference to ballyhoo the decision by Arkansas Rep. Tommy 
F. Robinson to switch from the Democratic to the Republican fold. (Story, Page 
2.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislative Setbacks 
</P>
<P>
But the focus of the news conference was on the legislative setbacks that Bush 
has suffered in the last few days. 
</P>
<P>
If he had to rate Congress' record so far, Bush said, "I wouldn't give it very 
high marks." He said that just because he is not attacking Congress "in a 
personal way does not mean I'm happy with the legislative calendar." He said 
Congress had discarded his appeal to act on the S &amp; L crisis within 60 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bush told reporters, "I think we will prevail for most of what we want." 
He pointed to the forthcoming defense battle in the Senate, which he hopes will 
rescue his defense program. 
</P>
<P>
Bush foresaw ultimate victory in his fight to keep $50 billion of the cost of 
rescuing the savings and loan industry out of the budget -- and the deficit. 
House-Senate conferees voted Thursday night to reject Bush's plan and make the 
cost of the bailout reflected in the deficit and reduce the long-term interest 
cost.

The former geisha whose tales of infidelity brought down Japan's prime minister 
said today she cried tears of happiness when she saw Sosuke Uno announce his 
resignation on nationwide television this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Victory at last," was Mitsuko Nakanishi's first reaction when Uno told the 
nation Monday he would resign. "Tears came running down. I felt like an athlete 
who just won a game." 
</P>
<P>
Uno, 66, who served only seven weeks as prime minister, was unable to put to 
rest Nakanishi's allegations he paid her $21,000 for a four-month, extramarital 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had not spoken out, he would still be prime minister today," Nakanishi, 
40, said in her first interview with a foreign correspondent since Uno's 
resignation announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I set out to get him and I got him," said Nakanishi.

Pet store employees identified former Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes as the man 
who stole a $17.25 bag of dog food in June, a detective testified today. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes, now a municipal judge in Cleveland and possible candidate for mayor 
this fall, has claimed he became involved in a dispute with a cashier and 
returned later to pay for the dog food. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes in January admitted taking a $2.39 screwdriver from a Bedford store and 
paid $50 restitution in exchange for a promise not to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
Shaker Heights police detective Gerald Jankowski testified today in municipal 
court that Stokes' picture was included in a photography spread after store 
employees gave him their description of the suspect. The employees then picked 
Stokes' picture and he was charged with shoplifting.

A Soviet Navy vessel picked up three Cuban refugees adrift in an inner-tube 
raft off the Florida coast today and helped them seek political asylum in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets lowered a life raft into the water, picked up the refugees, then 
radioed the U.S. Coast Guard and asked them to pick up the Cubans, the Coast 
Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees said they left from Santa Cruz, Cuba, last Saturday aboard a 
12-foot boat that later capsized and sank. The three were taken to Jackson 
Memorial Hospital, where they were in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard spokesman said Soviet crewmen had questioned the Cubans and were 
aware the Cubans were fleeing the Communist island.

The opposition leader in Myanmar, formerly Burma, has been on a hunger strike 
since the country's military leaders placed her under house arrest eight days 
ago, Western diplomats said today. 
</P>

They said Aung San Suu Kyi, secretary of the National League for Democracy,

conditions as supporters who were arrested as part of a crackdown on her party 
last week. 
</P>

The 44-year-old daughter of assassinated independence hero Aung San has taken

state. Diplomats said Aung San Suu Kyi's British husband, Michael Aris, was 
also at the house.

Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said today he has asked 
the Food and Drug Administration to consider major changes in government food 
labeling standards. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is expected to propose a federal rule on the various aspects of food 
labeling early next year. The agency has long required labeling listing 
ingredients, net weight and nutritional information on foods. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said there is no comprehensive, mandatory food labeling requirement 
for nutritional labeling for all foods, despite the government's efforts to 
improve food labeling. 
</P>
<P>
"Interest in food labeling has never been higher," Sullivan said in a 
statement. "Food labeling bills have been introduced in Congress. Consumers are 
watching what they eat more closely."

<P>
The House today approved a one-year suspension of a tax rule on health plans 
that business groups claim is so costly and complex to administer that it 
threatens the ability of some companies to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers' 376-26 approval of legislation containing the suspension of 
so-called Section 89 is unlikely to be the last word on the subject from 
Capitol Hill. Later this summer or fall, Congress plans to act on legislation 
that would simplify -- but not repeal -- the rule's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Section 89 establishes a series of tests that employers must go through to 
prove that their health plans do not favor higher-paid workers. The goal of the 
requirement, enacted in 1986, is to expand the number of employees covered by 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Many business groups have claimed that the rules are so hard to follow that 
some companies would be forced to drop health plans altogether. The rules were 
to take effect last Jan. 1 but became such a source of controversy that the 
Treasury Department delayed their implementation until Oct. 1.

DOW STEADIES AFTER 2-DAY ADVANCE, CLOSES OFF 0.19%

The New York stock market steadied today after its strong advance over the past 
two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The market's performance was unsurprising: many Wall Street watchers had 
expected stocks to bump into some profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in some ways today was kind of a day off," said Hugh Johnson of First 
Albany Corp. "It was a day of rest after the good days we've had recently." 
</P>
<P>
Trading slowed in the afternoon as market participants closed out positions 
ahead of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished almost even on the day at 
2,635.24, off 0.19. It ended the week with a gain of 27.88 points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advances Lead Declines 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 800 up, 663 down and 497 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 180.61 million shares, against 213.68 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.16 to 190.38. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index declined 0.84 to 374.51. 
</P>
<P>
A government report showing U.S. personal income edged up 0.3% in June while 
consumer spending fell slightly after adjustment for inflation boosted bond 
prices, sending interest rates lower, a movement which was welcomed by the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
"Good things happened in the bond market and because good things happened in 
the bond market the stock market was able to handle the profit taking that 
occurred very easily," said Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 1/2 point, or about $5 per 
$1,000 in face amount late this morning, after gaining nearly one point in the 
previous session. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 7.98% from 
8.02% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
rose between 5/32 and 3/16 point by late morning, intermediate maturities 
advanced between 9/32 point and 3/8 point and long-term issues gained 5/16 
point to 9/16 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
trading at 8 15/16%, down from 9% late Thursday.

The U.S. dollar rose sharply today against all major currencies in thin 
European trading while gold prices fell more than $4 a troy ounce.

<P>
Dealers said the dollar steadied in early trading as European dealers digested 
U.S. economic growth data released Thursday, squared their dollar positions and 
then withdrew from the market. 
</P>
<P>
But the dollar strengthened later when U.S. traders, who had earlier bet on a 
decline in the dollar, also squared their positions and generated dollar 
buying.

Betting parlors operated by Caliente Race Track in Tijuana will soon begin 
accepting wagers on U.S. professional and collegiate sports, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Caliente, which operates sports books in four cities and plans to expand, was 
recently granted permission by Mexican government officials to conduct sports 
wagering, according to a report published today in the San Diego Union. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials said the betting, illegal throughout the United States except 
in Nevada, will begin in Tijuana as soon as computerized equipment needed to 
monitor the wagering is installed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just waiting for them to tell us their start-up date," said Rafael 
Martinez, an official with the Ministry of Interior, in a telephone interview 
Thursday from Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
An unnamed source described as a leading member of the Las Vegas gaming 
industry said Caliente officials have contacted an odds maker concerning the 
establishment of betting lines to be used for U.S. events, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana is 15 miles south of downtown San Diego and about 130 miles south of 
Los Angeles, two areas that provide Las Vegas with much of its betting 
clientele. 
</P>
<P>
The source, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, said Caliente 
officials have indicated that sports betting in Mexico will be limited to Baja 
California and Baja California Sur, the two states composing the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Caliente operates race books in Tijuana, Rosarito Beach, Tecate and Mexicali 
that handle bets on horse and dog racing. Expansion plans call for new betting 
parlors in La Paz, Loreto and Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico claims a 1% tax on existing race wagering and will presumably deduct the 
same tax on sports betting. 
</P>
<P>
Caliente officials, possibly worried that early publicity and recent shifts in 
local political power might kill the new betting plans, declined to confirm the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anything to really, solidly say," said Caliente General Manager 
Arturo Alemany. "For 40 years, this has been a rumor. . . . I just want to tell 
you that anything that gets out on this could hurt us more than it would help 
us." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 12.5 million people live within 130 miles of Tijuana, about 2.5 
million in San Diego County, at least 8.5 million in the rest of Southern 
California and 1.5 million in Tijuana itself. 
</P>
<P>
In Las Vegas, where the population is fewer than 1 million, during the fiscal 
year ending June, 1988, $962.7 million was wagered in Clark County's 41 sports 
books, according to Charles Anderson, a financial analyst for the Nevada Gaming 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
From the $962.7 million, Anderson said the "hold," or what the betting parlors 
had left after paying off winning wagers, was $25.4 million, amounting to about 
2.6%.

BOOK CLAIMS PLAYER ABUSE;

'SUGAR DADDY' TIED TO NORTH CAROLINA DRUGS

"Personal Fouls," the book about North Carolina State basketball, alleges that 
Chris Washburn used cocaine as a player and that a "sugar daddy" gave the team 
gifts and substances to mask drug abuse, the Charlotte Observer reported. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which obtained an advance copy of the book Thursday, also said 
author Peter Golenbock quoted an unidentified player as saying Coach Jim 
Valvano knew Washburn was using cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The book, the Observer said, quotes an unidentified former teammate as saying 
the following about Washburn: 
</P>
<P>
" 'Wash' would play games on coke. The first half he'd play great, and then the 
coke would wear off, and in the second half he wouldn't do a thing." 
</P>
<P>
Washburn, who left North Carolina State after his sophomore year, has been 
banned for life by the NBA for substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The book also says "sugar daddy" supplied players with money, clothes, stereo 
equipment and substances to mask drugs in urine tests, according to the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano, North Carolina's basketball coach and athletic director, could not be 
reached for comment. His lawyer, Art Kaminsky, said neither he nor Valvano 
could comment until they read the book. 
</P>
<P>
"A quick review of 'Personal Fouls' by university officials indicates the book 
is a work of fiction and has no relationship to the reality of the fine 
basketball program at NCSU," Albert Lanier, vice chancellor for university 
relations, said in a statement read by a university spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore the university does not find any reason to further address the book, 
point-by-point or in general." 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock quoted former Wolfpack Manager John Simonds extensively but did not 
identify many of the players he claimed to have interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock referred to that practice as "something I hate to do but in many 
cases the only way I could impart the information and at the same time protect 
the source. Almost every conversation I had, I taped. The tapes are in a safety 
deposit box." 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Schuster announced in February that its Pocket Books division had 
dropped plans to publish the book. It was published by Carroll &amp; Graf 
Publishers. 
</P>
<P>
The original dust jacket, distributed in January, accused Valvano of exploiting 
his players and claimed wrongdoing in academics, drug testing and finances, 
among other things. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano and Chancellor Bruce Poulton denied the claims. Valvano said Golenbock 
did not contact him about the book.

Greg LeMond, newly crowned Tour de France champion, will skip the next two 
World Cup cycle races in Britain and Canada, his team director said today. 
</P>
<P>
Team director Jose de Cauwer said the American will miss Sunday's Summer 
International in Britain and next week's Grand Prix des Ameriques in Canada 
because he wanted to take it easy for a while after his thrilling Tour de 
France victory last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of riding the Summer International in Newcastle, LeMond will take part 
in a small race in Bilzen, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
De Cauwer said LeMond will return to the World Cup circuit Aug. 12 for the San 
Sebastian classic.

<P>
NASCAR driver Rusty Wallace has filed papers in a North Carolina Superior 
Court, asking that his contract with the Blue Max Racing team be declared void. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents prepared by Wallace's attorneys say Blue Max breached the 
contract with repeated late payments of earnings due Wallace. They say Blue Max 
is thwarting Wallace's efforts to change teams for 1990, even though "Blue Max 
has agreed privately and has admitted to Wallace and others that Wallace is 
under no obligation" to drive for his present team next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I bear absolutely no ill will toward Raymond (Beadle), and our disagreement is 
strictly business-related," Wallace said in a statement issued through Don 
Miller, his business manager for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, in Talladega, Ala., preparing for Sunday's Diehard 500, told the 
Charlotte Observer that he "would have preferred that the court papers hadn't 
come to light until after the race."

A former Howard University football coach at the center of a growing scandal 
over players who apparently played after their four-year college eligibility 
had expired has said he never intentionally used ineligible players. 
</P>
<P>
As many as one-third of the players on the Howard team have been told they have 
one less year of eligibility than originally thought going into the 1989 
season, school officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
The eligibility foul-up apparently affects about 30 players recruited for the 
Bison under former coach Willie Jeffries, Howard deputy counsel Francis Smith 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffries, contacted Thursday, said he was told he was told three players Howard 
attorneys have asked him about were eligible. 
</P>
<P>
"The records we were shown indicated they had not played before" 1984, he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he went to Washington in mid-June to give a deposition to Howard 
attorneys, "they asked me about the three players and the financial aid 
irregularities," he said from his Orangeburg, S.C., office. 
</P>
<P>
"The records we were shown indicated they had not played before. We thought 
they were redshirt freshmen. To our knowledge they only played four years. They 
said they had not played in 1983." 
</P>
<P>
The school has said it is investigating irregularities in the Bison football 
program under Jeffries over four years.

<P>
A 28-year-old Canadian woman, suffering fatigue and hallucinations, had to 
abandon her efforts to swim from Santa Catalina Island to the mainland for 
charity early today. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Keith, abandoned her quest after 19 hours in the chilly ocean waters. She 
had covered about 21 miles of the nearly 24-mile crossing but had to give up 
when strong currents kept her from her goal. 
</P>
<P>
"My body just wasn't ready for it," she told her mother by phone after 
abandoning the swim. 
</P>
<P>
Keith said the hallucinations occurred when she blinked and thought she saw a 
huge tanker in her path as she swam. When she blinked again, the ship was gone. 
</P>
<P>
She attributed the hallucinations to lack of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Keith, a powerful athlete from Toronto, planned to use only the butterfly 
stroke as she crossed the San Pedro Channel in a fund-raising event for a local 
children's charity. She began her swim in Santa Catalina's Emerald Bay about 8 
a.m. Friday and had hoped to reach Cabrillo Beach, about 26 miles south of Los 
Angeles, early today.
