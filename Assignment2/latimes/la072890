SACRAMENTO FILE: LAW MANDATES TREATMENT FOR CAMPUS RAPE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Gillam, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has signed into law a bill (AB 3098) to require public 
and private colleges and universities to provide counseling and treatment to 
students, staff and faculty members who become rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation resulted from a 1989 interim hearing held at UCLA where 
testimony revealed that some higher-educational facilities do not have a system 
in place to assist rape victims, according to Assemblywoman Lucille 
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), the sponsor of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Research also showed that rape occurs four times more frequently among young 
female college students than the overall rate for women, the chairwoman of 
Select Committee on Assistance to the Victims of Sexual Assault said. 
</P>
<P>
"Colleges swept the seriousness of this issue under the carpet for fear it 
could bring bad press and consequently declining enrollments," she said. 
"College rape victims were not receiving adequate care or counseling -- and 
many cases are not even reported to the police." 
</P>
<P>
Effective Jan. 1, the new statute will require colleges and universities to 
adopt written procedures on sexual assault to deal with cases that happen on 
campus and at school events. 
</P>

ANGER OVER MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for The Times' continuing coverage of the malathion spraying issue in 
our neighborhoods and the concern for public health. As a resident of Echo Park 
for six years, I have been through many rounds of Medfly spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Local news reported that the city had presented insufficient evidence to 
warrant the cancellation of the spraying. The news also reported that the judge 
who ruled in favor of the state asked that samples be gathered on July 12, 
1990, to be submitted to the court for reevaluation. At 9:00 p.m. that night, 
the spraying began and I watched while the helicopters flew over downtown and 
Echo Park. In the past, the spraying over my apartment building has involved 
numerous and repeated passes by the helicopters, often taking as long as 30 
minutes in one small area. I was surprised that night, however, that the 
helicopters passed one time only over my house. With this in mind, I am 
concerned that the information based on the samples submitted to the court 
would be misleading and a misrepresentation that would possibly damage the 
credibility of the city's and individual claims against the malathion 
applications ordered by the State of California. 
</P>
<P>
Although the toxic-substances testing measures parts per thousand, it would 
seem that this inconsistency in application during a period ordered by the 
court would allow for a greater chance of inconclusive sampling data -- and 
this means more spraying.

<P>
The malathion spraying doesn't eradicate Medflies, and there's overwhelming 
evidence that this toxic rain is dangerous to our health and devastating to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
I can only conclude that the spraying isn't about Medfly eradication at all. 
It's about the arrogance of government in this "democratic" country to do 
whatever the hell it wants to do, and the taxpayers be damned. In a perfect 
expression of naked power and contempt for the citizens, the officeholders in 
Sacramento and Washington poison us, then hand us the bill to pay for it.

Jefferson was right. We do need to have a revolution ever so often.

John Vornholt's letter (letters, July 14) is but the latest attempt to 
discredit malathion spraying on the basis of an unproven threat to human 
health. The city of Los Angeles tried to use similar arguments in its suit to 
stop the spraying, and the judge rejected the suit while noting that the toxic 
content of dirt was higher than that of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry Friedman's adjacent letter, like recent Times' editorials, 
criticizes spraying on the basis of the program's effectiveness. If spraying is 
to be discontinued, this is the point that must be stressed. The infestation is 
real; the possible danger from spraying is largely hypothetical. The force of 
the former will almost always refute the latter. Moreover, other parts of the 
country accept aerial spraying as simply an inconvenience that goes along with 
insect control and eradication. We should do the same, unless, of course, we 
can show that such spraying does not work. And evidently, it does not. The 
statistics of the last 10 years are not at all encouraging, and suggest that 
another approach is needed. 
</P>
<P>
It is time that we stop trying to halt spraying by frightening the public with 
imagined consequences that may never come, and start demanding more 
cost-effective ways to control a pest that is already here.

CHARGES OF RACISM IN FILM INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Black people are collectively fed up and feel that it is time for negative 
portrayals of blacks in films and on television to cease. Black people of 
conscience throughout the nation applaud Clegg for having the wisdom to 
recognize the seriousness of this issue, for having the courage to speak out 
against it, and for having the decency and sense of reason to request a forum 
to discuss a resolution of same. 
</P>
<P>
Clegg's request for a summit between blacks and Jewish producers does not 
constitute prejudice; but rather, it demonstrates the actions of a reasonable 
man who is seeking racial harmony in an effort to restore the dignity of his 
people.

QUAKE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm writing to express my family's and my neighborhood's most vigorous 
opposition to any bill aimed at creating mandatory earthquake insurance. It 
doesn't matter whether the bill covers every county or just those at risk from 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter if the bill covers personal belongings or merely structural 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of the state government collecting additional moneys through the 
insurance companies and simply holding it for possible use in the event of an 
earthquake is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
There will be pressures to use the money for minor earthquakes, 
earthquake-related projects, and (eventually) general expenditures. The 
insurance companies will claim a portion of the money as their administrative 
fee. The money will be available for deposit in banks that are favored by the 
governor and his treasurer. The money will be removed from the general economy 
and will reduce economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
It's far better to borrow when needed than to tax in advance of need and let 
the money lie fallow, possibly for decades. 
</P>
<P>
When the time comes for proper disbursement of state funds for earthquake 
relief, the voters will happily approve a bond issue or other borrowings, as 
necessary.

<P>
By DANIEL B. BOTKIN, Daniel B. Botkin, professor of biology and environmental 
studies at UC Santa Barbara, is the author of the recently published book, 
Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the 21st Century. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We learned about the Santa Barbara Painted Cave fire from BBC television news 
in London. A few phone calls later, friends told us that our house lay in the 
path of the fire if the winds shifted and continued to blow, and we took the 
next plane home. 
</P>
<P>
Helpless for 10 hours at 30,000 feet, I had plenty of time to think about risks 
and our environment in Southern California, risks that we all face. After we 
reached home and discovered that the winds had died in time and our house was 
standing, we talked with friends and acquaintances who had lost their houses in 
the fire, a tragedy that has affected everyone in Santa Barbara. One of the 
most poignant aspects was how many people seemed surprised and shocked that 
they lived in a high-risk area. 
</P>
<P>
People who come to Southern California seem to assume that society -- the 
government or some institution -- has determined that the house they buy is in 
a safe location. People who have moved here from the urban East have told me 
that it never occurred to them that their house would be in danger. But those 
of us who study the environment can read the terrain and see that there are 
plenty of homes in Southern California in high-risk locations. 
</P>
<P>
We live in a Mediterranean climate where the native vegetation -- the scrubby, 
dense bush called chaparral -- has evolved to endure in a fire-prone habitat. 
If it does not burn, chaparral vegetation eventually becomes old, its growth 
slows or ceases and the plants die back. Only a fire rejuvenates an area, 
promoting new root-sprouting and allowing seed germination, so chaparral plants 
produce an abundance of fuel that tends to promote fires on an average of every 
several decades. 
</P>
<P>
So we know that we live in an area where fire is natural and where its natural 
rate of occurrence in any one spot is about every 30 to 50 years. A house high 
up the hillside, surrounded by chaparral, is a higher fire risk. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Manalis, a physicist at UC Santa Barbara and a specialist on wind energy, 
says that the landscape also determines where the windiest spots are likely to 
be. Air, like water, flows downslope, following low-lying canyons. The Painted 
Cave fire spread this way, moving rapidly downslope, more or less along lower 
channels in the topography. A house in one of these airsheds is also at higher 
risk for fire. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us don't have the expertise or the time to learn how to read the 
landscape when we shop for a house. But house-buying in California requires a 
complete disclosure of defects by the seller. We could add to the list of 
disclosure items the relative environmental fire risk, on a scale from one 
(almost none) to five (very high). The fire department or another government 
agency with expertise would determine the rating. 
</P>
<P>
People have asked me whether there should be zoning or regulations to prevent 
house construction in high-fire zones. My answer is: We need to divide the 
risks we face into two categories -- risks that affect only us, and risks that, 
if we accept them, also impose additional risks on others. For example, if we 
choose to build a house well up in the mountains, far from other houses, then 
the risk is pretty much ours alone. As long as homeowners understand it, and 
can obtain insurance, then we can justify allowing people to take such risks. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, suppose you build a house in a high-fire neighborhood and insist 
on cedar shingles. This imposes additional fire hazards on your neighbors as 
well as yourself. It would seem fairest to use zoning regulations to prevent 
that non-voluntary sharing of risks. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, fires are not the only environmental risks we face in southern 
California. Three other important ones are flooding, mudslides and earthquakes. 
When I first came to California I was amazed to see houses built on small flood 
plains in tight canyons where, if an infrequent flood occurs, houses would be 
rapidly inundated and residents would have little chance of escape because of 
the steep sides of the flood plain. I was also amazed to see houses 
cantilevered out on on unstable slopes. Disclosure during house buying should 
also rate the risk of flooding and mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
Some may ask why we can't eliminate the risk of chaparral fires. I suppose we 
could, if we were willing to pave the hillsides, but then why live here? Didn't 
most of us choose this part of the world in part because of its beauty? 
</P>
<P>
We can't realistically eliminate the risk of chaparral fires. But we can 
increase awareness and develop policies so that each citizen knows the risks. 
</P>
<P>
Let us hope that it is a long time until the next fire, and that during that 
time we improve the ways in which we approach the risks that are part of the 
environment in Southern California.

DEBATE CONTINUES OVER NEA GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 years ago, Walt Whitman, arguably America's greatest poet, became 
the victim of the kind of narrow-mindedness that Sen. Jesse Helms and the NEA 
now seek to impose upon us. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Sillen in his "Walt Whitman, Poet of American Democracy" noted that: "A 
few months before Lincoln's death, Whitman had been appointed to a clerkship in 
the Department of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
One day, the bigoted secretary of the department, James Harlan, snooped around 
in the clerk's desk, found a copy of 'Leaves of Grass,' threw up his hands in 
horror, and fired the author of 'an indecent book.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sillen added that "Leaves of Grass" received more national attention than it 
would have received without this act of intolerance. In those days, apparently, 
not everyone in the Administration felt compelled to clone each other 
politically. Whitman moved from the Interior Department to the attorney 
general's office, enabling him to live and continue writing.

PAVING OVER THE CIVIL WAR

BRANDY STATION, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One after another, the Civil War battles that determined America's future are 
being refought, with money and political influence instead of muskets and 
cannon. As Washington, Richmond and other cities in the theater of that war 
sprawl outward, development pressure is intense. Multimillions are at stake. So 
is the heart of American history. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, up the road at Manassas, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan announced a 
federal program to resist commercial intrusion on these battlefields. Earlier, 
Congress stepped in to buy threatened land there for more than $100 million. As 
Lujan said, that is "the worst way to do it . . . We don't have enough money 
just to go off and buy all these sites." 
</P>
<P>
He named 25 Civil War battlefields where the National Park Service wants to 
help stave off development. Among them is this one, Brandy Station, not a clash 
on the scale of Manassas but a tactical turning point in the war because here 
the Federal cavalry finally fought a large-scale stand-up battle against the 
vaunted Jeb Stuart and got away with its pride intact. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of more than 5,000 acres of the battlefield site has applied to build 
an industrial park and housing complex. If local officials approve the 
development, there is no way the government can buy the whole battle site as a 
national shrine. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan's idea is to spread around a mere $15 million as seed money to encourage 
private preservation efforts. He cites the Richard K. Mellon Foundation's 
donation of 10 important parcels to the park service through the Conservation 
Fund as an example of what he hopes will follow. 
</P>
<P>
But at least one park service historian bemoans "the visionary notion that 
partnership can cure all the ills of the modern world." Considering the stakes, 
the most an ambitious developer is likely to volunteer in the way of 
battlefield preservation is a plaque noting that so many thousand Americans 
died in a battle fought beneath the pavement of his latest shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan wants to encourage zoning, easements, land-banking and historic 
designations. He would help publicize threatened projects. His department will 
start a national Civil War commission as a clearing house, which would support 
state commissions and battlefield studies. 
</P>
<P>
Only an ingrate would see this as a low-cost public relations gesture, empty of 
substantive meaning in the big-money world of zoning and development.

CUTS IN L.A. COUNTY SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that Joe Domanick ("L.A. Turns Its Back on Its People," Commentary, 
June 20) has difficulty coping with the reality that Los Angeles County simply 
does not have the funds to be everything to everyone, and taxpayers do not want 
to pay more property taxes for more services. The county budget has not been 
the same since voters gave us a clear message a dozen years ago when California 
became the birthplace of the taxpayers' revolt. Domanick shows a lack of 
information or understanding of county financing, which leads him to make 
erroneous conclusions that mislead his readers. 
</P>
<P>
Domanick presents himself as a defender and voice of the people, and protests 
cuts to health services. Ironically, he criticizes the Board of Supervisors for 
their aggressive and forward-thinking action of including Proposition 99 
(tobacco tax) funds in the county's 1988-89 budget, an action that basically 
"saved" the health-services system. In July, 1988, to avoid severe 
health-services curtailments, the board courageously, and correctly, 
anticipated the voter's subsequent approval of the Proposition 99 initiative. 
Los Angeles County budgeted the use of these funds in 1988-89 for 
services/programs included in the initiative and in accordance with the initial 
enabling legislation, AB 75. At issue with the state is subsequent legislation, 
AB 1154, enacted in April, 1990, 10 months after the close of the 1988-89 
fiscal year, which states that Proposition 99 funds could not be used prior to 
July 1, 1989. The county is in negotiation with the state regarding this issue, 
which may result in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticizes the Board of Supervisors for allocating funds for jail 
construction at the same time mental health clinics are proposed for closure. 
This is a comparison of apples and oranges and leads readers to believe that 
jails are expanding at the expense of mental health programs, which is not the 
case. Jail construction is financed through state and local bonds -- funds 
approved by the voters -- and these funds cannot be used for any other purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Domanick also notes funding increases for the Sheriff's Department amounting to 
125% since 1982-83. He fails to mention that the County Jail inmate population 
has increased 136% during the same period, and that the already overcrowded 
jail system, which has a capacity of 15,528, has consistently had to deal with 
a population in excess of 20,000 during the past few years. The Sheriff is 
mandated to house all pre-sentenced inmates and inmates sentenced to a year or 
less in the county of Los Angeles, and is currently under a federal court order 
to provide facilities to ease overcrowded conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Domanick contrasts increases in the budget for the Sheriff's Department to the 
needs of the poor and indigent, which he says have been "contemptuously 
dismissed." The fact is, since 1982-83, indigent aid has grown from $69 million 
to $168.8 million, a 144.6% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Domanick also mischaracterizes the mental health budget, placing primary 
responsibility with the county. Mental health is a state program -- the county 
is only the agent of the state required to provide a match to state dollars. 
The mental health program in Los Angeles County is not a $29-million county 
program; it is a $242-million program funded 85-90% with state funds, as 
required by law, with a 10-15% county match. The reduction in funding is not 
caused by county reductions but by the state's failure to fund the program 
adequately. Costs for mental health services have increased and the number of 
mentally ill has increased, but state funding has basically remained the same 
for the "grime-encrusted souls" referenced by Domanick. 
</P>
<P>
Every year for the past four years, the Board of Supervisors has 
compassionately taken up the responsibility of the state and allocated 
considerable amounts over and above the legally required match to state funds 
to maintain critically needed mental health services for the chronically and 
severely mentally ill in this county. In 1989-90 alone, the board allocated 
over $8 million more for mental health services than was required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Domanick would be well-advised to focus his complaints on the funding 
responsibility at the state level. Realistically, we must, however, also 
acknowledge the critical budgetary problems facing the state -- there is not 
enough money to meet all the needs. Something has to give and difficult choices 
must be made.

BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE, BUT MANY SAY HE STILL HAS A PLACE IN THE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As big a fan as I am of both sports and the writing of Mike Downey, I found 
myself incredibly angry after reading his comments about the Pete Rose 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter that Pete Rose was a brilliant baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
That's a given. It doesn't matter that his managerial talents are 
extraordinary. I think he belongs in the Hall of Fame, because accomplishments 
off the field, no matter how dubious, have nothing to do with what goes on with 
the leather, the wood and the lineup card. 
</P>
<P>
I struggle with enough take-home dollars to pay the bills, like most folks. I'd 
love those deducted dollars back every week. But if I don't pay my taxes, I go 
to jail. Just like Pete Rose. And to feel sorry in any way, shape or form for 
his image or his situation is, in my opinion, just as big a crime.

How ironic that on the day when Pete Rose is sentenced to jail, Richard Nixon 
is honored with his new library. I predict Pete will be the next great comeback 
and be sent straight from the Hall of Shame to the Hall of Fame.

Pete Rose doesn't belong in the Hall of Fame. He is a liar, cheat, and most of 
all, a first-class jerk. 
</P>
<P>
On the list of criteria to being elected to the Hall is integrity "on and off" 
the field. I was at a card show a few years ago when Rose started to get loud 
and use foul language in front of the kids until someone told him to keep it 
down. 
</P>
<P>
He might have had a few more hits than anyone, but he played twice as long as 
the normal player. He lied to his fans and he lied under oath to the courts. He 
shouldn't be allowed to step in another ballpark, as a player, coach or fan.

Shell Oil Co.: The nation's sixth-largest oil company said its second-quarter 
earnings plunged 63% to $161 million on revenue that slipped 12% to $5.2 
billion. Houston-based Shell said the results reflected weakness in all three 
of its businesses -- exploration, oil products and chemicals -- and a writeoff 
of unproductive offshore oil properties.

'THIRTYSOMETHING' FLAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to Howard Rosenberg for his accurate sentiments in his July 19 column 
"ABC Pulls Plug on a Rerun of 'thirtysomething.' 
</P>
<P>
" 
</P>
<P>
The rejected show, which had a scene of two men conversing in bed after having 
sex, was one of the stronger ones, and the actors made it funny as well as 
real. 
</P>
<P>
It might very well be true that by not running it now, the producers can do 
equally strong shows in the future, but somehow I don't believe that. It is 
cowardice (and probably not effective business) to let the extreme right wing 
of this country dictate television content.

FACES . . . : GORDANA RASHOVICH REKINDLES OBIE-WINNING 'SHAYNA MAIDEL' ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I thought I would find it all very distracting and too pretty to concentrate 
on the Holocaust here in West Hollywood," says actress Gordana Rashovich. "But 
I went to the Simon Wiesenthal Center and I watched a show about Hitler on TV, 
so there was no problem refocusing." 
</P>
<P>
Rashovich is repeating her haunting, Obie Award-winning performance in Barbara 
Lebow's acclaimed drama "A Shayna Maidel," currently playing at the Tiffany 
Theater in West Hollywood. Set in New York City in 1946, "Shayna Maidel" tells 
the story of two Jewish sisters, one brought up in the United States and the 
other a survivor of a Nazi concentration camp in Poland, and their father, who 
reunite after a separation of 20 years. Rashovich plays Luisa, the fragile, 
painfully thin and ghostly pale survivor, haunted by the memories of her dead 
mother, baby daughter and best friend, and obsessed with finding her missing 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
The actress originated the role of Luisa five years ago at the Hartford Stage 
in Connecticut and appeared in the hit Off-Broadway production for nearly a 
year. Rashovich finds working with a new cast and director (Deborah LaVine) 
stimulating. "It's like visiting an old friend in a foreign country, someone 
you don't get to see on a daily basis. You go back and the same things are 
rekindled, the same kind of friendships, the same kind of bonds." 
</P>
<P>
Rashovich prepared for her role by reading books and watching films on the 
Holocaust. "I am a little shy about asking direct questions to survivors," she 
says. "If they are interested in telling me things, I will sit there. But 
reading is private. You can do it at home and you can personalize it." 
</P>
<P>
She also drew on her European trips as a youngster (her father is Yugoslav, her 
mother American). "I always heard war stories there," she remembers. "These 
people didn't forget World War II. It was in their back yard. I will never 
forget those stories -- how people had to hide in the forest and eat wood to 
survive. I think that left an indelible impression upon me." SUSAN KING

FACES . . . : PENELOPE ANN MILLER: FRESHMAN UP AGAINST BRANDO AND DENIRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"The Freshman's" Penelope Ann Miller has, mercifully, but a single scene with 
the feisty, tail-snapping, eight-foot Komodo dragon-impersonating lizard around 
which the plot revolves. The downside is that Miller must share the screen with 
a far more terrifying presence: Marlon Brando. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't intimidated by him at all," says the L.A. native of the legendary 
actor. "In fact, I found him to be very friendly and sweet. When I met him, he 
gave me a big bear hug. . . . He cracked a couple of my ribs." 
</P>
<P>
She had the gumption to darken her hair for the audition. You see, a sandy 
blonde just doesn't cut it portraying the daughter of New York "importer" 
Carmine Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>
Miller has done plenty in features, TV and on the stage, but she is still 
enough of an unknown to be in an American Express commercial. Not for long, 
though. The daughter of actor-filmmaker Mark Miller is teamed with Robert 
DeNiro and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the soon-to-be-released "Awakenings" and 
"Kindergarten Cop." 
</P>
<P>
"You never really know how you're gonna feel when it happens," says Miller of 
the fame thing that seems to loom. "I don't get recognized very much because I 
look so different in my movies. I'd rather be acknowledged for my work than for 
me as a personality." 
</P>
<P>
There was a familial atmosphere on the set of this little comedy. Because of 
that, Miller, like almost everyone else, was floored when Brando called it 
"terrible, a stinker," soon after production ceased. Brando later withdrew his 
critique, but damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
"I was definitely shocked. I mean, everybody was," says Miller. "Nobody 
expected it, because that wasn't our experience. That wasn't his experience, so 
we didn't understand what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought: 'Is this a joke?' " DAVID PECCHIA

Re Chuck Philips' "Trial to Focus on Issue of Subliminal Messages in Rock" 
(July 16): I cannot believe anyone could rightly blame the music of Judas 
Priest or of anyone else in the self-inflicted shootings of two youths whose 
parents are now suing the band and CBS Records. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming a rock song is, I'm sure, far easier for the parents than facing 
reality, but saying that Judas Priest made them do it is like blaming William 
Shakespeare if someone killed himself after reading the romantic double-suicide 
tale "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how many people commit suicide after listening to Frank Sinatra or 
watching reruns of "Laverne and Shirley"?

JORGE AND ROSS GO ON THE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kleber Jorge has finally taken matters into his own hands. Despite the recent 
highly visible presence around town of the expatriate Brazilian 
singer-guitarist-songwriter, a record contract has been an elusive goal. So 
Jorge and partner Rachel Ross invited a bunch of friends and fans to the cozy 
environs of Studio City's La Ve Lee Restaurant on Tuesday night, booked a 
mobile recording unit, and made their own recording. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge's musical lineage traces in a direct line to the jazz-tinged rhythms and 
rich harmonies of Antonio Carlos Jobim and Dorival Caymmi. Few of the nine new 
works on the program revealed any of the rock and fusion influences that have 
crept into the work of Jorge's contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Desculpe Caymmi," for example, a warm, sensuous song that provided a superb 
setting for Jorge's dark-toned voice, used a Caymmi phrase as its starting 
point. Other pieces -- "Belfort Roxo Street," "Brother" and "Freeway to 
Saudade" were good examples -- matched Jorge's arching melodies with Ross' 
multiplaned, storylike lyrics. In the best tradition of Brazilian popular song, 
they combined the oddly complementary elements of dance, passion and social 
awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge was at his best, soaringly lyrical on the ballads, bracingly energetic on 
the rhythm tunes. For this program, at least, his excellent guitar playing took 
a back seat to the accompaniment of Brazilliance. Jorge has made the group -- 
with Bill Cantos on keyboards, Glen Garrett on saxophone and flute, Arnou De 
Melo on bass, Teo Lima and drums and Kevin Ricard on percussion -- into the 
perfect vehicle for his music. 
</P>
<P>
The only remaining question is whether or not any of the major record labels, 
so lax thus far in recognizing Jorge's potential, will take a closer listen to 
his self- produced recording. They'd be wise to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Kleber Jorge and Brazilliant will also appear Wednesday at St. Marks in Venice, 
and every Sunday in August at Lunaria in West Los Angeles. DON HECKMAN

A TRIO IN THE NAT KING COLE TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of Triple Treat, who converged on Catalina's Bar &amp; Grill on 
Thursday for a four-day run, had not played together in three months, yet from 
the first two-bar riff of Horace Silver's "Sister Sadie" it was as if they had 
never been apart. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was simple: The men are Monty Alexander, Ray Brown and Herb Ellis, 
mature veterans (at 46 Alexander is the youngest) who, after years of 
intermittent collaboration, have achieved the precision of a Swiss watch. The 
metaphor may be a trifle misleading, since there is no semblance of 
clockworklike rigidity in their uniquely loose, consistently swinging 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
As is often the case with piano-guitar-bass groups (a jazz tradition that began 
half a century ago with the Nat King Cole Trio) the pianist seemed to be the de 
facto leader, yet there was not a tune in which Brown's bass and Ellis' guitar 
failed to contribute significantly. 
</P>
<P>
The blues seemed often to be a centrifugal force that drew them together, even 
when the 12-bar idiom was not precisely followed, as in an Alexander original, 
"Think Twice," routined with tempo changes and a darting solo interlude by the 
composer; and again in a double-time blues that sounded like a variation on "Hi 
Heel Sneakers" that brought the set to a gospel-tinged finale. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when so many groups shamelessly plug their albums, it was a surprise 
to observe that Triple Treat goes to the other extreme; not a word was spoken 
from start to finish, leaving listeners to wonder whether this or that tune was 
a standard or an original, and why certain numbers seemed vaguely familiar. The 
latter speculation may have applied to the delectable waltz "Always," to which 
Alexander applied additions and redefinitions far beyond the harmonic 
imagination of Irving Berlin, who wrote this basically simple melody in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
Other chestnuts in the first set were Ray Noble's "The Very Thought of You" 
(1934), with a spellbinding Ray Brown solo; and "I Want to Be Happy," a Vincent 
Youmans ditty to which the trio appended one of those repeated-riff tags that 
seemed to imply a reluctance to stop. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, for whom this instrumentation is second nature (he and Brown toured 
together for five years with Oscar Peterson), soloed with his accustomed 
age-proof, blues-informed ease. In short, Triple Treat lives up to its name and 
to the illustrious reputations of its components. The gig ends Sunday. LEONARD

WRYLY COMICAL VIEW OF THE OLD WEST IN 'EL DIABLO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There haven't been many inspired comic Westerns -- "Cat Ballou" and "Blazing 
Saddles" are notable exceptions -- but HBO's two-hour "El Diablo" (which 
premiered last Sunday and repeats at 3:30 p.m. today) is offbeat and off-center 
enough to be surprisingly diverting. 
</P>
<P>
Right off the top we know our young protagonist by the way he stumbles out of 
his hotel in a small, dusty town, runs into a chicken and tells the rooster 
he's sorry, and means it. As this mild-mannered schoolteacher from Boston, who 
can't ride a horse or shoot a gun, Anthony Edwards (who was the cocky young 
pilot in "Top Gun") manages a sublime stretch of acting. 
</P>
<P>
The other star is Louis Gossett Jr., a crusty, aging gunslinger who teams up 
with the greenhorn to chase down a raping, pillaging Mexican gang that has 
kidnaped a faint-of-heart damsel who was the tenderfoot's student. When they 
find her, she's become the sultry lover of the entitled devil (the dashing but 
not at all hammy Robert Beltran). 
</P>
<P>
The writers (Tommy Lee Wallace, John Carpenter and Bill Phillips) also dispatch 
a quick point dramatizing how Western literature historically ignored the black 
cowboy. In a grubby cantina, the Gossett character complains to Kid Durango, a 
popular writer of pulp Westerns (a fey, wonderful performance by Joe 
Pantoliano) that he never writes about cowboys being black. The author waves 
off the remark by implying his stories wouldn't get printed if he did. 
</P>
<P>
(Remember when Sidney Poitier, in the 1966 Western "Duel at Diablo," literally 
introduced most of America to the black cowboy?) 
</P>
<P>
"El Diablo," directed with jaunty irreverence by Peter Markle, is full of sly 
quirks: The bespectacled hero, a clumsy rider, frequently shoots down his 
horses by accident because he can't hold a gun, and Gossett, who loves his 
horse, is always stuffing its ears with cotton before a gunfight because the 
animal is sensitive to noise. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot of wholesale mayhem -- guys you like die -- and even this gives 
the movie a tangy edge.

POP BEAT / SOUL: KIPPER JONES' 'ORDINARY STORY' IS ANYTHING BUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smash hits by M.C. Hammer and Bell Biv Devoe are saturating the black and pop 
airwaves, and Mariah Carey is giving Lisa Stansfield a run for her money in the 
best white soulster of the year category. But when it comes to up-to-the-minute 
freshness and innovation in soul music, only a few other artists have delivered 
the goods in recent weeks. Two of them -- Kipper Jones and Kwame &amp; a New 
Beginning -- top the list this week in a roundup of new soul releases, rated on 
a scale of one star (poor) to five (a classic): 
</P>
<P>
**** Kipper Jones, "Ordinary Story," (Virgin). Jones was in the L.A.-based 
group Tease, a vintage-suit-wearing band that was a killer on the local club 
circuit but was ignored by radio. Jones' debut solo album draws from areas that 
are obviously important to him: racial pride, religious convictions and an 
abiding affection for unvarnished funk of the James Brown-Sly Stone-George 
Clinton variety. 
</P>
<P>
The album's eclecticism may keep Jones one of the best-kept secrets in soul, 
but it's a textbook example of how to draw from different sources to arrive at 
a sound that is wholly your own. Jones' musical instincts are as razor-sharp as 
the late R&amp;B giant Donny Hathaway's, and he is as original in his thinking 
as Steve Arrington, another neglected urban innovator who is still on the scene 
today. Probably no one but Jones, though, would think to embellish a fiendishly 
funky message song like "My House" with brief snippets from "The Lord's Prayer" 
and the Staple Singers' "I'll Take You There." It would be a disaster in less 
competent hands, but from the first track to the last, Jones makes all of his 
ideas pay off. 
</P>
<P>
*** Kwame &amp; a New Beginning, "A Day in the Life -- A Pokadelick Adventure" 
(Atlantic). Seemingly hellbent on being this year's De La Soul, Kwame has a 
calculatingly quirky delivery that's largely hit-and-miss for most of this 
album -- although opening each track with a "message" from his answering 
machine is a funny ploy. What lifts this debut effort above many of your 
standard hip-hop offerings is the earnestly sweet-and-sour singing of group 
member Tasha Lambert on "Ownlee Eue" and "Oneovdabigboiz." The latter is an 
expression of Kwame's desire to become one of rap's big boys on the block. With 
an album this raw and imaginative, his wish is probably on the way to becoming 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 The Chimes, "The Chimes," (Columbia). This racially mixed, British soul 
trio owes a heavy stylistic debt to Soul II Soul, but you could play 
name-that-influence with most of the songs here, including the Marvin Gaye-ish 
"Love Comes to Mind" and the Chaka Khan-inspired "Heaven." Lead singer Pauline 
Henry sings with more passion than tonal precision, and it's tough going trying 
to decipher all the lyrics on her handling of U2's "I Still Haven't Found What 
I'm Looking For." Still, it's easy to understand why group founders James Locke 
and Mike Peden added her to their lineup. Passion can compensate for a lot of 
stylistic shortcomings, and this is a vibrant young group whose best work 
appears to be still ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 Lakeside, "Party Patrol," (Epic/Solar). If partying is your priority, 
you're better off with M.C. Hammer and Bell Biv Devoe. Lakeside's forte here is 
music for those quieter, one-on-one encounters. "Sailing" and "Let the Moon 
Shine" are polite little boudoir ballads that never break into a nasty sweat, 
while the breezy, island appeal of "Talk About Love" is reminiscent of Natalie 
Cole's '70s hit "La Costa." Not a great album, but respectable. 
</P>
<P>
** Barbara Weathers, "Barbara Weathers," (Reprise). When Sharon Bryant departed 
from Atlantic Starr several years ago, replacement Weathers gave longtime fans 
of that pop/soul unit a good reason not to jump ship as well. An excellent 
singer, Weathers is stymied here by tunes that are relentlessly reined-in and 
stodgy. The worst moment is on the dirge-like "Our Love Runs Deep." Weathers' 
operatic range is impressive, but this track sinks under the weight of its own 
serious intentions. Weathers' talent is as substantial as Lisa Stansfield's or 
Mariah Carey's, but what she lacks is what they've got: memorable, standout 
songs.

SCRIPPS MEMORIAL AND SCRIPPS CLINIC PLAN TO MERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a whirlwind courtship, Scripps Memorial Hospitals and Scripps Clinic 
&amp; Research Foundation have agreed to unify next Jan. 1, leaving Sharp 
HealthCare as the jilted party in a health-care triangle. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise union announced Friday will create the largest health-care concern 
in San Diego County, an $820-million-a-year conglomerate that will be the 
county's No. 2 non-governmental employer. 
</P>
<P>
It also effectively scuttles Scripps Clinic-Sharp HealthCare merger talks that 
had been going on for a year. There had been reports in the health-care 
community over the last month that those talks had broken down. 
</P>
<P>
A Sharp spokeswoman tersely said Friday that Sharp was surprised by the move. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't participate in the (Scripps-Scripps) deliberations, nor were we 
advised of them. We had continued our discussions with the clinic regarding 
development of joint clinical programs literally until today," said Cindy 
Cohagen. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had no comment on the future of the joint organ transplant program 
that Sharp and Scripps Clinic inaugurated last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was publicity in early June about the potential Scripps 
Clinic-Sharp merger that helped bring about the union of the two Scripps 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
After reading about the Sharp merger talks, trustees of the two Scrippses began 
talking informally later in June, said Ames S. Early, president of Scripps 
Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions quickly snowballed. Over the last two weeks, administrators 
entered the talks, and the deal was set, Early said. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions moved so quickly, he added, because Scripps Memorial and Scripps 
Clinic share a common corporate culture from their roots in the philanthropy of 
Ellen Browning Scripps. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper heiress established both the hospital and the research foundation 
jointly in 1924, but they split in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
Participants rapidly became engaged and enthusiastic as the merger talks 
progressed, Early said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tended to share many similar values over the years, so culturally we 
tend to be very much alike," he said. "Once you can step above the daily 
situations, you can see the appropriateness and the potential of this 
reunification. People very rapidly became convinced that it's the right thing 
to do and that it would really be a loss if every attempt were not made to 
bring this result about." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said the average patient won't notice any differences in 
services at either institution as a result of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Like Scripps Clinic and Scripps Memorial, Sharp's hospitals are nonprofit and 
rooted in private philanthropy. However, Sharp over the last several years has 
consolidated into what is regarded in the health-care community as one of the 
most rigid, bottom-line medical organizations in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Charles C. Edwards, president of Scripps Clinic, downplayed the idea that 
corporate culture influenced the decision to pursue a merger with Scripps 
Memorial instead of Sharp. He emphasized instead the longstanding community 
spirit of La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong feeling in La Jolla and surrounding areas for these two 
institutions," Edwards said. "This gained enthusiasm and moved as fast as it 
did because it made so much sense -- to our joint constituencies, (to) our 
trustees it made immediate sense." 
</P>
<P>
The alignment of the two Scripps institutions with each other will create the 
largest health-care conglomerate in the county. 
</P>
<P>
It also will improve the chances of both institutions maintaining a steady 
supply of patients in a very competitive environment. Some analysts believe 
hospital closures are inevitable as San Diego's health-care industry realigns 
itself for this tight marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind that this is the direction of the way 
health-care is going to go," Edwards said of the merger. "I think this is going 
to be a prototype that is going to be watched very closely around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Early noted that the two facilities will be able to share costly new machines 
instead of both buying the same ones. 
</P>
<P>
The merger between the two institutions also positions both of them for the 
competition expected when UCSD opens its Thornton Hospital, being built less 
than a mile down Interstate 5 from Scripps Memorial -- La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards would not comment on that, but added, "I think that a combination of 
Scripps Memorial and Scripps Clinic is a far bigger and stronger institution 
than either one of them individually and can better compete together than 
independently, regardless of what the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Early noted, however, the spirit of cooperation is even extending toward UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps Memorial officials are in active discussions with UCSD on the 
possibility of running cooperative programs when the new hospital opens, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a large private biomedical research institute, Scripps Clinic 
operates a 173-bed hospital and seven outpatient clinics. More than 350 
physicians are affiliated with these operations. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps Memorial operates a 456-bed hospital in La Jolla, a half-mile away from 
Scripps Clinic, as well as acute-care hospitals in Chula Vista and Encinitas, 
and convalescent hospitals in La Jolla and Encinitas. It is planning another 
hospital in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Early and Edwards said discussions are not final on how to meld the two 
institutions, particularly since both have research institutes. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps Clinic scientists are at the forefront of a variety of biomedical and 
genetic engineering research. At Scripps Memorial, the Whittier Institute has 
been established to research basic science issues in diabetes and related 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement announced Friday is a letter of intent, not the final unification 
agreement. Further negotiations will continue, with the goal of completing the 
union by Jan. 1.

EL CAJON FIRM EXPECTED TO PLEAD GUILTY IN DEFENSE CONTRACT CASE; 
</P>
<P>
OVERPRICING: AMETEK-STRAZA, A SUBMARINE SONAR MAKER, HAS AGREED TO A PLEA 
BARGAIN IN THE FRAUD CASE AND WILL PAY THE GOVERNMENT $5.1 MILLION IN DAMAGES, 
SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An El Cajon submarine sonar maker is slated to plead guilty Monday in San Diego 
federal court to two criminal counts of defense contracting fraud and, in a 
related civil case, pay the government $5.1 million in damages, sources close 
to the plea bargain confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ametek-Straza is due to plead guilty to two counts of overpricing in connection 
with the 1986 bids for sonar systems used on two classes of Navy nuclear 
submarines, sources confirmed. The systems work but were sold at inflated 
prices, sources confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The civil case involves charges of overpricing on labor from 1983 to 1987, 
sources said. Like the criminal case, it arose from a tip from a disgruntled 
former employee -- who stands to pocket $765,000 of the $5.1 million under a 
novel anti-fraud federal law designed to reward "whistle-blowers." 
</P>
<P>
The criminal case will result in a $110,000 fine, sources said. Ametek's 
eligibility for future defense contracts remains to be resolved, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Ametek is scheduled to agree to the plea bargain Monday morning before District 
Judge Gordon Thompson Jr., according to documents filed late Friday at the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The bargain was struck after repeated and intense negotiations that dragged on 
for much of this year, sources said. The company retains the ability to back 
out of the pact until Monday's court session. 
</P>
<P>
Alan J. Ludecke, the San Diego lawyer for the former Ametek employee who tipped 
federal agents to the case, declined Friday to comment on details of the deal. 
But he called his client, who remains anonymous, a "sort of a hero." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people like my client have to make a living and they have to support a 
family," Ludecke said. "To do so and work in the (defense) industry, obviously 
they jeopardize their ability to provide for their family" by coming forward 
with allegations of overpricing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes great courage, I think, to make that kind of allegation and provide 
proof," he said. Ludecke declined to offer any other details about his client. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Phillip L.B. Halpern, who prosecuted the criminal case, 
declined to comment Friday on the case. Ametek's Los Angeles-based lawyers 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Ametek officials did not return a call late Friday to company offices. The 
company's Straza division now appears in the phone book as Ketema -- or Ametek 
spelled backward. 
</P>
<P>
Sources, who asked to remain unnamed, said the plea bargain explains a 
September, 1987, raid at the El Cajon offices by about 2 dozen agents from the 
Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Naval Investigative Service. 
Agents toiled 12 hours to pack and cart away files in a 2 1/2-ton truck. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal case involves the sale price on two submarine sonar systems used, 
in part, for navigation 
</P>
<P>
under ice, sources said. The Navy uses one system, called the AN/BQS-15, in its 
Los Angeles-class nuclear attack subs, while it deploys the other one, the 
AN/BQS-6, in its Trident nuclear attack subs, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law for the bidding under which the systems were sold to the Navy 
requires a contractor to provide up-to-date data detailing production costs, 
sources said. The Navy then uses that information to determine how much it will 
pay, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy uses this bidding system in single-source contracts -- that is, those 
where no other company stands ready to offer a competitive bid because no other 
firm makes the product. 
</P>
<P>
The first criminal count deals with pricing information supplied in April, 
1986, while the second dates from June, 1986, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
If Ametek had supplied more current information, the government would have 
saved money, sources said. They did not disclose the amount of the potential 
cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit, meanwhile, was brought in Ludecke's name on behalf of the 
former Ametek employee. Under the 1986 revision to an 1863 law called the False 
Claims Act, a private citizen may file a civil suit in the name of the 
government alleging fraud by a contractor and share in any financial recovery. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the suit against Ametek charges overpricing of labor 
charges from March, 1983, through September, 1987, on electronics contracts 
with the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $5.1-million settlement, the anonymous employee stands to recover 15%, 
or $765,000, sources said.

Two 8-year-old Escondido boys, believed missing since early Thursday, were 
still missing Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boys, Dominic Navarro and Ricardo Sanchez, were last seen when their 
parents dropped them off for school at Central Elementary.

<P>
They were not reported missing until the parents returned to pick them up and 
learned they had not attended class that day, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called at 11 p.m. Thursday, after parents checked with family and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
Both boys are Latino, 40 inches tall and weigh 60 pounds. They have black hair 
and brown eyes.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL TRUSTEES REAFFIRM SUPPORT OF READING 
SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawndale School District trustees have unanimously reaffirmed their support for 
the "Impressions" reading series, despite a review panel's conclusions that 
some of the material is inappropriate for grade-school pupils and that some 
readings need to be handled with caution. 
</P>
<P>
The board, which adopted the controversial series published by Holt, Reinhart 
&amp; Winston, agreed to convene a panel of teachers, parents and 
administrators after receiving complaints from some parents and members of a 
conservative Christian organization that the stories are satanic and filled 
with morbid themes. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-member panel concluded that the books are generally acceptable, but that 
five selections in the teachers' books are inappropriate and that 21 selections 
in all four series books need to be handled with sensitivity.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old Rancho Penasquitos man who killed a teen-ager in a gang-related, 
drive-by shooting was sentenced Friday to 20 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
John Michael Mizicko was also ordered to pay, from his prison wages, $6,000 to 
the family of Raymond Jose, 17, of Mira Mesa, to cover burial and funeral 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge David Gill granted a defense motion to place Mizicko in 
the California Youth Authority until age 25, when he will be transferred to an 
adult prison to finish his term. 
</P>
<P>
Jose was shot Nov. 18, 1989, near a Mira Mesa taco stand. 
</P>
<P>
Mizicko testified June 6 that he fired the gun because a crowd of gang members 
began rushing toward his car, and he feared he would be injured if he didn't 
fire to scare them away. 
</P>
<P>
The jury convicted Mizicko of second-degree murder June 8. 
</P>
<P>
Gill imposed a sentence of 15 years to life for the murder and an additional 
five years because the shooting was committed from a moving vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of Mizicko's car, Lawrence Rowe, 18, also of Rancho Penasquitos, has 
been ordered to stand trial for murder as an adult and may be arraigned next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
A Juvenile Court judge ordered that Rowe and fellow passenger DeVon Brumfield, 
18, of Rancho Penasquitos, stand trial for murder as juveniles, but the 4th 
District Court of Appeal overturned the decision on Rowe, and he will be tried 
as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Brumfield's case in Juvenile Court is pending. He and Rowe are in custody.

PANEL EXPECTED TO OK FUNDING REQUEST

<P>
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors is expected Tuesday to approve an 
application for $150,000 in federal funds for a project designed to reduce gang 
and drug involvement in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"Gang activities in the county have been increasing, but compared to places 
like L.A., we have nothing," said Sharon Clark, supervising deputy probation 
officer at the Colston Youth Center. 
</P>
<P>
The center, a division of the county Corrections Services Agency, is proposing 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
In the category of funds that Ventura is applying for, Clark said, only 10 
projects nationwide will be granted funding. But, she added, the county does 
have a fighting chance. 
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the proposed project are to provide support groups for 
incarcerated youths who are involved with gangs and drugs, to fund 
presentations by former gang members and former drug users and to offer parents 
gang and drug awareness education. MAJA RADEVICH

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: WATER RATE HIKE PLAN QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ojai officials are skeptical about a water company's attempt to revise its 
billing rates to encourage water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously this week to notify the state Public 
Utilities Commission of several concerns about a rate increase proposal 
submitted by Southern California Water Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based company has held a franchise to provide water to the city 
since 1948. It serves 2,688 customers in and near Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Council members agreed that the revised plan is an improvement over the 
company's original proposal, which did not provide residents with economic 
incentives to save water. But they questioned whether customers will conserve 
enough for the company to achieve a 20% reduction in the amount of water it 
sells, the goal set in justifying the proposed rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert McKinney, a consultant for Casitas Municipal Water District, 
said a voluntary 20% cutback over any length of time is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
The council instructed City Manager Andrew Belknap to ask the Public Utilities 
Commission if a 20% reduction seems feasible and also to question whether the 
company needs to spend $346,000 to reduce the manganese level in its well 
water, which already meets health standards. 
</P>
<P>
The city also will ask whether the company should be allowed to increase its 
revenues from Ojai by almost 47% over the next three years, as the company 
proposes. 
</P>
<P>
Susan L. Conway, the company's rate adjuster, said Thursday that the commission 
will not allow higher rates unless the increase is needed to meet expected 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Conway said the revenue is needed to cover inflation costs, repair leaky 
waterlines and carry out a new conservation awareness program. The manganese 
filters, she said, are needed because customers complain that well water 
occasionally looks dirty. THIA BELL

DENTAL FILES SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY REMAINS

Coroners trying to identify the skeletal remains of an Ojai woman they believe 
drowned in a 1969 flood have been unsuccessful in locating dental records to 
confirm her identity, a Ventura County deputy coroner said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The bones and teeth discovered earlier this week on a hillside below an Oak 
View road may be those of Jeanetta LaBelle, a 39-year-old woman who police 
believe was drowned in a Jan. 25 flood 21 years ago, said Mitch Breese of the 
Ventura County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
To confirm her identity, a dental comparison needs to be made with the five 
teeth that were found and old X-rays, Breese said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need somebody who has done dental work on her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coroners located one area dentist who had treated LaBelle, but the records had 
been lost, Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate said. Wingate said that although it is 
unlikely that another dentist will come forward, the case will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
"We always hope that something will turn up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While rescuing a driver whose car had plunged off California 33 Monday, rescue 
workers discovered a skull about 60 feet down the steep hillside on the 
southeast corner of the highway's intersection with Creek Road. 
</P>
<P>
After the rescue, about 10 members of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department's 
Search and Rescue Squad, four detectives and the coroner combed the area and 
found some leg, finger and rib bones, as well as the five teeth. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, records indicate, one woman drowned in the San Antonio Creek in Oak 
View and the floods killed another 11 people in Ventura County, said Francis 
Rugin, a librarian for the Ventura County Museum of History and Art. The storms 
began Jan. 18 and flooded area rivers and streams including the Ventura and 
Santa Clara rivers, and caused about $15 million in damage, she said. KIRSTEN

PASSERS-BY PULL WOMAN FROM BURNING VEHICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol on Friday credited several passers-by with saving 
the life of a woman whose car rear-ended a truck and was engulfed in flames on 
the Golden State Freeway near Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
The passers-by left their cars on the freeway and quickly pulled Lisa Webb from 
her burning Volkswagen "beetle" after the 8:30 p.m. accident Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer A.J. Torres said Webb, 27, of Bakersfield suffered second- and 
third-degree burns over 30% of her body and was in serious condition Friday at 
Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said Webb is being investigated for driving drunk but had not been 
arrested because of her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Webb was driving south at a high rate of speed on the freeway's downslope near 
Castaic when she passed a slow-moving car and crashed into the back of a 
tractor-trailer going about 40 m.p.h., Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
The Volkswagen became caught under the rear of the trailer and was dragged 900 
feet until the truck driver, Kenneth Angel, 28, of Whittier could pull to the 
shoulder. Angel was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
"The dragging caused sparks which caught the Volkswagen on fire," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
At least four passers-by ran to the burning car, authorities said. They were 
identified at the scene as Rick Howton of Santee and Christopher Margulas, Lisa 
Davis and Anthony Dohrman, all of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Passers-by saw what happened, stopped and pulled her out of the burning 
vehicle," Torres said. "Judging by the injuries she had, they probably saved 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Webb was flown by helicopter to the hospital. None of her rescuers were 
injured, the CHP said.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT EXTENDS ORDER TO STOP HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court commissioner Friday extended for three years a restraining 
order that prohibits a woman from harassing Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich and his family. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich had obtained a temporary restraining order against Eileen Kristovich 
on July 6 after he accused her of threatening to kill him, his sister and his 
sister's family. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor and Kristovich met many years ago when their parents were 
business partners. In the past, Antonovich complained in court papers, 
Kristovich has followed him on dates, dumped red paint on his car and damaged 
it with a can opener. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Virginia Chernack signed papers forbidding Kristovich from 
threatening Antonovich and his family, following them or calling them. She also 
must not go within 100 yards of their homes, places of work or school. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich did not attend the court hearing in Burbank, but his sister, 
Madeline Pangborn, and her two daughters did. No one testified during the 
proceeding, which lasted no more than two minutes. Pangborn declined to comment 
after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Kristovich was admitted to a psychiatric ward at County-USC Medical Center 
after allegedly making the death threat to Pangborn on July 2. She has since 
been released.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE RAZES GAS STATION AND INJURES MECHANIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale mechanic was burned and a service station destroyed Friday when a 
gas tank he had removed from a car ignited, touching off a blaze that sent a 
towering pillar of black smoke over the city. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Fire Department spokesman Chris Gray said the mechanic, Albert 
Sanchez, 46, apparently dropped the gas tank, breaking a shop light which 
caused a spark that ignited fumes in the service bay. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez was treated at Glendale Memorial Hospital for first- and second-degree 
burns on his forearms. 
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed the Mobil Station at the corner of Glendale Avenue and 
Colorado Street and also damaged three cars in its service bay. However, the 
station's gas pumps and underground tanks were never in danger, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials estimated the damage at $250,000.

THANKS FOR HELPING A LADY IN DISTRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are kind, helpful young men in our society! 
</P>
<P>
While driving alone the morning of June 26 on the San Diego Freeway through the 
Santa Monica Mountains, my car suddenly stopped. 
</P>
<P>
After several cars and trucks went around me, a young man pulled up in front, 
offered to call the CHP on his phone and immediately drove off. Next a van 
stopped, three young men jumped out and pushed my car across an on-ramp to the 
shoulder. They jumped back into their vehicle and off they went. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP arrived and called the Automobile Assn. of America, which took care of 
my problem. 
</P>
<P>
I'll be forever grateful to these exceptional men who helped a lady in 
distress.

A PICTURE OF WASTED WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently you printed a picture of two small children relaxing in a puddle 
caused by sprinklers in Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Park. While I can certainly 
appreciate their need to "Cool Off" during our recent heat wave, I would ask 
these questions: 
</P>
<P>
Why are the sprinklers on during the heat of the day? Why were they left on 
long enough to cause puddles this large? Water is evaporating very quickly in 
this heat, but there was still enough to cause puddles. 
</P>
<P>
Why are they watering cement instead of grass? 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that an extreme amount of water was wasted. This is just one 
park out of how many in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Come on Mayor Bradley. If you want to conserve water, maybe you should start 
with the government usage. Seems to me if you cut back by 10%, it would be a 
major step towards conservation. Only a combined effort will make the 
difference.

FED UP OVER PORTER RANCH PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a resident of the Porter Ranch area and I am appalled by the actions of 
our City Council. The council couldn't care less about the people of the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
All they want is the tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
They have given our land away to developers with complete disregard for the 
wishes of the public. Imagine if you can the beautiful rolling hills of 
Chatsworth leveled, and not only a Century City there, but also 3,400 
residential units. How much can you put into a 1,300-acre parcel of land? 
</P>
<P>
Many in the Chatsworth-Porter Ranch area are against this project and yet the 
City Council approved it. Is it any wonder the people of the Valley are fed up? 
They have our hands tied because we cannot incorporate as a city as the Santa 
Clarita Valley has done and Calabasas is voting to do. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Hal Bernson is concerned, I hope he has received his 30 pieces of 
silver. He has done his job for Nathan Shapell well.

CLOSING OF ICE SKATING RINK OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are only three full-size ice rinks in the Los Angeles area and only two 
with seating for events. 
</P>
<P>
One is going to lose its lease shortly, one is likely to be sold to settle 
family differences, and the third is Pickwick in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
That a rink that has served the public by providing wholesome activities for 30 
years suddenly is hopeless is unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
Please join the Save the Ice Committee in helping to keep sports available by 
doing whatever you can to keep Pickwick open.

BEMAN TAKES 1-SHOT LEAD OVER PALMER, PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PGA Tour Commissioner Deane Beman shot a 4-under-par 66 to take a one-stroke 
lead over Arnold Palmer and Gary Player after the second round of the Seniors 
British Open Friday in Turnberry, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Beman, who retired 16 years ago, had a 133 after two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, who shot a 68 Friday after tying for the opening-round lead with a 66, 
is seeking to win a pro tournament in a fifth decade. 
</P>
<P>
The best round on this blustery day was turned in by Player, whose 65 included 
an eagle 3 on the seventh hole. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Bob Charles was two shots off the lead with 135, one shot 
ahead of American Larry Mowry and Englishman Brian Waites. 
</P>
<P>
Beman, 52, had six birdies in Friday's round and said he battled to maintain 
his concentration after being away from competition for so long. 
</P>
<P>
Hale Irwin, who last month became the oldest player to win a U.S. Open, shot a 
nine-under-par 63 and Don Pooley shot a 65 to take a two-stroke lead, 12 under 
par, in the Buick Open at Grande Blanc, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Green also shot a 63 over the 7,014-yard Warwick Hills course. Green was 
tied at 134 with U.S. Open runner-up Mike Donald, Billy Andrade and Mike 
Sullivan. Fuzzy Zoeller and Dave Barr were at 135. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin, who took the Open from Donald in a playoff at Medinah, Ill., birdied six 
of the final seven holes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm swinging well," Irwin said. "I'm not putting superbly, but I don't have to 
putt too well because I'm hitting it so close." 
</P>
<P>
Green birdied seven successive holes, the fourth through 10th, one shy of a PGA 
Tour record shared by many. 
</P>
<P>
Dewey Arnette was the last to make eight in a row, in 1987 at Warwick Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I goosed No. 11. I got ahead of myself," Green said. "That's what happens when 
you start thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Donald, playing the back nine first, started with a bogey but birdied 12 
through 16 to get to 11 under. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Ertl shot a four-under-par 67 and took advantage of a quadruple bogey by 
Rosie Jones to take a two-stroke lead after two rounds of the LPGA 
Championship, in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Jones led by five strokes until her seven on the 195-yard, par-3, 16th hole. 
That helped give the lead to Ertl, who had six birdies and two bogeys for a 
five-under 137 total. 
</P>
<P>
For Ertl, 32, it was the first time she led a round since the du Maurier Ltd. 
Classic four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was at 139 and Cindy Figg-Currier and Cathy Johnston were tied for third 
at 140. 
</P>
<P>
They were the only players under par after two trips over the 6,246-yard 
Bethesda Country Club course. The cut, at 150, left 77 players to vie for a 
share of the record $1-million purse.

ANDERSON FINALLY WARMS TO TASK FOR U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: AMERICANS BEAT BRAZIL, 112-95, AND ADVANCE TO SUNDAY'S GOLD MEDAL 
GAME AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be no rematch. Mike Krzyzewski can stash his Valeri Tikhonenko file 
away for another day. 
</P>
<P>
The basketball final of the Goodwill Games will go on without the Soviets, who 
apparently had one gold medal performance in them and spent it early. In one 
respect, Krzyzewski was dead-on accurate: In this tournament, it is better to 
lose before the semifinals than during them. 
</P>
<P>
Jarred back into reality -- or at least a minor preoccupation with defense -- 
by Tuesday's round-robin loss to the Soviet Union, Team USA weathered the most 
dangerous one-man tempest in international basketball, Brazil's Oscar Schmidt, 
in a 112-95 victory Friday night and advanced to Sunday's gold medal game. 
</P>
<P>
There, Yugoslavia awaits, after its 84-78 triumph in Friday's other semifinal. 
As gifts to America go, this ranks as Yugoslavia's finest since the Lakers' 
Vlade Divac was allowed to wriggle out of military duty. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which had made only 11 of 44 three-point attempts entering 
the game against Brazil, made six of nine in the first half and 10 of 16 for 
the game. Kenny Anderson, who was one for six on three-pointers entering the 
game, made two in scoring 17 points in the first half. He finished with 25 and 
Billy Owens added 22. 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski had to be ecstatic. No more three-pointers by Tikhonenko. No more 
bristling at questions that associated the words national and embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the record, when someone asked if he was disappointed about missing a 
second chance at the Soviets, Krzyzewski played it low-key. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said, "because then we'd be playing for the bronze." 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski had been handed the last laugh. He was in no mood for a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
"And," he continued, "I'm not embarrassed that we're not playing the Soviets. 
I'm sorry. We were going to throw the game but, I'm sorry, we decided to go to 
the gold medal game." 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski said he didn't want to have "a Soviet fetish." "I don't know if 
losses can help a team," he said, "but I believe in losses not destroying a 
team, especially our team. . . . We learned from the Soviet game. We learned we 
had to play fewer people, eight or nine players, and we had to define roles 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"That and the fact Tikhonenko can shoot." 
</P>
<P>
With Tikhonenko's rapid-fire jump shot a thing of the past, Krzyzewski's team 
had to focus on the present -- Oscar Schmidt, the Big O of Brazilian 
basketball, the Larry Bird of the southern hemisphere. The Americans knew the 
face. In the 1987 Pan-American Games, Schmidt scored 46 points against Denny 
Crum's U.S. squad and brought Brazil back from a 20-point deficit to win the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
The stage for a repeat was set again Friday, with Brazil trailing, 58-45, at 
halftime. Two minutes into the second half, Schmidt had made two quick 
three-pointers and the U.S. lead was down to eight. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Schmidt had 25 points. But his legs are 32 years old now and they were 
running in their fourth game in five days. Schmidt faded from view momentarily, 
going nine minutes between baskets, after which time those legs did a lot of 
catching up. 
</P>
<P>
One good thing about inexperience: Youth doesn't tire so fast. The United 
States' full-court attack -- pressing defense, relay-sprint offense -- 
overwhelmed the Brazilians, with the U.S. breaking the 100-point mark with more 
than seven minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Anderson also had seven assists. Todd Day had 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Day was also the Americans' main Oscar-minder, although a whole starting lineup 
took cracks at him. Along with Day, Owens, Mark Randall, Christian Laettner and 
Doug Smith went after Schmidt in shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt wound up with 38 points, but had to take 29 shots to get them. He made 
13. 
</P>
<P>
And, as they say, they were a deceptive 38. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't look like that good a player when you first see him," Day observed. 
"Then you get back to the locker room and he's got 38 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was telling me, 'Good defense.' Then I look at the stat sheet and 
see 38 points. I don't call that good defense." 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski, though, called it good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine teams have tried every kind of defense in the world against him," 
Krzyzewski said. "Tonight, we had Todd and some of our bigger players on him. 
With a small guy on him, he likes to go inside and if it's close, he's going to 
get fouled. (Michael) Jordan gets the calls in the NBA. All the great ones know 
how to get fouled. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought Oscar was more dangerous going inside and getting free throws than 
by shooting three-pointers. All you can do is try to make him shoot less than 
50%, which is what we did." 
</P>
<P>
Now, on to Yugoslavia. The gold medal, left for dead Tuesday night, can fall 
into American hands with one more victory. 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski didn't want to say he told us so, but . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We're very, very pleased to be playing for the gold medal," Krzyzewski said, 
eating up the moment. "I hope we're not the only ones hungry for it. As much as 
everybody wants, and expects, us to win it, I hope the fans Sunday night really 
get behind the U.S. Team."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

STIEB OUTDUELS HOUGH FOR 1-0 BLUE JAYS' VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way Dave Stieb is stopping American League hitters, it's not surprising 
that he is being accused of illegal pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb (13-3) gave up just five hits in seven innings Friday night at Toronto, 
and Glenallen Hill hit his ninth home run in the third inning to give the Blue 
Jays a 1-0 victory over Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing managers have complained about Stieb, who has pitched well in July. 
But the veteran right-hander has survived glove, hat and uniform checks in four 
July starts to post a 3-0 record, giving up only three runs in 28 2/3 innings. 
In this game he walked four and had to work out of several jams. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't so much that I've pitched well," Stieb said. "It's more that the 
defense behind me has been so good. That makes anyone a better pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way I'll start thinking of 20 victories. My goal is to win 14. I 
would have had better success in this one if I didn't give up so many walks." 
</P>
<P>
Duane Ward pitched a scoreless eighth inning and Tom Henke struck out two of 
the three batters he faced in the ninth to earn his 21st save in 23 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Hill's second home run in the last three games, Charlie Hough (7-7) 
had his knuckleball working. He gave up eight hits and struck out six in 7 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I was lucky," Hill said. "If that had been one of his good ones 
(knucklers), I wouldn't have hit the ball at all. I just happened to get one 
that wasn't doing any dancing. That's the knuckler I like." 
</P>
<P>
Boston 1, Detroit 0 -- Tom Bolton (4-1) held the Tigers to four hits in 7 2/3 
innings at Detroit to win for the first time on the road after seven losses. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Morris (8-13) outpitched Bolton, who went into this season with a 2-7 
record. But batterymate Mike Heath's wild throw set up the only run of the game 
in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 19th unearned run this season off Morris, most against any pitcher 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers had the bases loaded with two outs in the eighth, but shortstop Tim 
Nahering made a leaping catch of Cecil Fielder's line drive to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Bolton pitched just like he has all year," Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan said. 
"He got behind hitters, but he was missing low, not high, where they could hit 
it. Then (Dana) Kiecker and Murph (Rob Murphy) did the job." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox remained just a game behind Toronto with their second victory in 
seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game the Blue Jays obtained veteran left-hander John Candelaria from 
the Minnesota Twins for infielder Nelson Liriano. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 7, Milwaukee 4 -- Carlton Fisk hit his 345th home run in a three-run 
first inning at Chicago and the White Sox moved to within 2 1/2 games of first 
place in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk has 324 of his home runs as a catcher and needs three to tie Johnny Bench, 
the all-time leader. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McDowell (6-5) won for the first time in five starts, giving up three runs 
and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Pasqua also homered for the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 9, Oakland 4 -- Catcher Brian Harper extended his hitting streak to 
16 games with a two-run double in a six-run fifth inning at Minneapolis that 
carried the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire and Felix Jose hit home runs for the Athletics, who have lost two 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Harper climaxed his big night by throwing out Rickey Henderson trying to steal 
second base. It was only the third time this season Henderson was thrown out 
actually trying to steal. Twice he has been picked off. 
</P>
<P>
New York 3-4, Cleveland 0-1 -- Andy Hawkins, who had failed to win his last 12 
starts, even losing a no-hitter, pitched a three-hitter in the opener. It was 
the first victory for Hawkins (2-8) since May 6. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game Jeff Robinson (3-6) pitched seven innings, and the Yankees 
earned a sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Kelly and Steve Balboni hit home runs in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 9, Kansas City 2 -- Rookie Ben McDonald made his second consecutive 
winning start in this game at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, who pitched a four-hit shutout in his first start, gave up two runs 
and six hits in 6 2/3 innings Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He also stopped George Brett's hitting streak at 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
Leadoff batter Phil Bradley had four hits, scored two runs and drove in two to 
spark the Baltimore attack. DAN HAFNER

ROSEANNE IS SORRY -- BUT NOT THAT SORRY; 
</P>
<P>
CONTROVERSY: ONCE SHE STARTED SINGING THE ANTHEM, SHE SAYS, SHE PANICKED. AS 
FOR PRESIDENT BUSH: 'I'D LIKE TO HEAR HIM SING IT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Comedian Roseanne Barr was full of contrition at a crowded press conference 
Friday as she told how panic set in four notes into her now-legendary 
screeching of "The Star Spangled Banner" before the start of a San Diego Padres 
baseball game Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Barr said that she and her husband, Tom Arnold, called the press conference at 
the Beverly Hilton to put a stop to the furor, likening her predicament to what 
she described as the political "witch hunt" over Jane Fonda's controversial 
junket to North Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Barr still showed flashes of her trademark feistiness. Told that President Bush 
had said earlier Friday that her performance was "disgraceful," she shot back: 
"Well, I'm sorry I didn't sing so good, but I'd like to hear him sing it." 
</P>
<P>
Barr, whose "Roseanne" show on ABC passed "The Cosby Show" this season as the 
most-watched series on television, said that the slumping Padres' owners, 
coaches and players all thought the promotion in San Diego would be "fun." 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Werner (co-executive producer of her TV series and an owner of the Padres) 
said: 'We need something to turn this team around. Maybe you coming down, maybe 
that'll do it,' " Barr said. "You know, I figured that everybody knew that I 
wasn't the world's greatest singer." 
</P>
<P>
Once she started singing, Barr said, "I thought I was OK in the beginning 
because it was 'Working Women's Night,' you know . . . and I sang about four 
notes and I thought I was OK. And then everybody started booing me and I really 
went through this panic thing and for a minute I thought about, 'Well, can I 
just get out of here? Can I just turn around and just quit?' " 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I couldn't and I knew I had to finish it," she said. "So I just did the 
best I could. I'm not looking to apologize for doing it. It was the wrong 
choice for all of us. But nobody anticipated that it would be this negative." 
</P>
<P>
She said that no one is feeling worse than she is, " 'cause nobody's (been) 
treated worse than me." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's session started out more like a circus than an orderly press 
conference. A crowd of 100 people showed up, including 13 TV and film camera 
crews, 20 still photographers and several Los Angeles-based foreign 
correspondents representing media in Japan, Greece, Germany, France and Egypt. 
Many were attending a press interview down the hall with director Spike Lee for 
his new movie, "Mo' Better Blues." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold appeared first, sternly asking all representatives from the tabloid 
press to leave. When none complied, one writer told Arnold that photographer 
Kip Rano, standing nearby, sold pictures to supermarket tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
Barr and Arnold had announced earlier this week that they are preparing to sue 
the National Enquirer in an unrelated case. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold, flushed with anger, ordered Rano to leave. When he refused, Arnold 
taunted him, yelled several profanities and threatened to call off the press 
conference unless he departed. 
</P>
<P>
The tirade lasted about 20 minutes until hotel security called Beverly Hills 
police. Three officers eventually arrived, among them Officer Paul Kramer, 
target of the celebrated slap by actress Zsa Zsa Gabor. 
</P>
<P>
Rano, who runs a free-lance photo service in Beverly Hills, said he was 
negotiating with People magazine for his photographs of Barr during her 
ill-fated ballpark appearance and was at Friday's press conference for an 
English paper and "an anonymous client." He said that the police officers 
treated him nicely and let him go with only a warning once he was outside. 
</P>
<P>
Before the press conference ended, Barr admitted that she would think twice 
about singing the national anthem in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But she added: "I represent a certain part of America that probably nobody else 
represents. And I came out of someplace, and got someplace, and I've got a 
right to sing the song."

IT'S A CHICKEN JOKE TO SOME BUT THOSE INVOLVED AREN'T LAUGHING

In the sometimes mundane world of zoning code enforcement there is nothing like 
a little chicken law to lighten moods and inspire a few cheap puns. 
</P>
<P>
So when Los Angeles County officials announced this month that they intend not 
only to ban "adult male chickens" (read it as roosters) from many 
neighborhoods, but also to limit to six the number of hens per household, the 
bromides began to fly. 
</P>
<P>
Someone suggested that neighbors had cried fowl over noisy chickens. It was 
said county officials would ruffle a few feathers with this one. And one wag 
concluded that chicken owners were sure to squawk at this half-baked idea. 
</P>
<P>
But to some, chickens are no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
In many of the unincorporated areas where the law would be enforced, homeowners 
blame sleepless nights and frazzled nerves on roosters that crow at all hours. 
They say even relatively hushed hens can fill the air with unpleasant odors. 
</P>
<P>
"Zoning problems are not as funny when you live next door to them," said John 
Calas, head of zoning enforcement for the county. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors' complaints about chickens are probably as old as the first cock's 
crow, but county planners said the problem has grown as housing tracts have 
encroached on former farming districts and as immigrants from Mexico and 
Central America bring chickens to neighborhoods that are more familiar with 
dogs. Animal control officers said the immigrants often keep the birds for 
pets, food or entertainment -- namely cock fighting, which is already banned by 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
No one keeps tabs, but the manager of the county's Carson animal shelter 
estimated that crowing complaints have increased by 20% in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken owners protest that the county ordinance -- the subject of a public 
hearing Aug. 9 before the County Regional Planning Commission -- is a gross 
overreaction to a problem that should be handled with existing nuisance laws. 
They say the proposed ban on roosters -- covering all residential neighborhoods 
and agricultural lots of less than an acre -- would kill a hobby they have 
enjoyed for years. 
</P>
<P>
The ban eventually would have to be approved by the County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"We are panicking," said Chris Maddalena of Azusa, an amateur chicken-breeder 
who lavishes attention on his black minorcas and white leghorns the way some 
people dote on their poodles. "This ordinance would devastate me and everyone 
in our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Most cities already have ordinances that limit or prohibit barnyard animals in 
residential zones. Carson, Pasadena and Torrance, for instance, ban chickens, 
regardless of sex. In the city of Los Angeles, homeowners can keep an unlimited 
number of chickens as pets, but not for commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
But in unincorporated areas of the county -- from parts of the Antelope Valley 
to Rowland Heights and from Malibu to Lennox -- the rules on chickens are not 
as clear. 
</P>
<P>
Many residential areas in the unincorporated county are zoned for agriculture, 
and restrictions on the location of chicken coops apply only to commercial 
poultry operations, Calas said. Zoning laws are usually written to outline what 
is permitted, and since the county's residential codes are silent on chickens, 
that should mean they are prohibited, Calas said. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors have told county officials they would be more comfortable going 
to court armed with an outright rooster ban, rather than having to produce 
evidence that the birds are disturbing the peace, said John Orr, an assistant 
county planner. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the chicken law, which would permit homeowners to keep a maximum of six 
hens and order that the birds be kept in pens at least 35 feet away from homes. 
Roosters would be banned, county officials said, because they make most of the 
racket. 
</P>
<P>
Without a law banning the birds, chicken opponents have been forced to depend 
on existing nuisance laws -- sometimes snapping photos, making secret 
recordings and logging the times that roosters crow to persuade authorities 
that the birds are disturbing the peace. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken owners like Maddalena said the proposal flies in the face of tradition 
in neighborhoods like his, where nearly everyone keeps a chicken or two. 
Maddalena, who has 100 birds, said he and friends in the Pacific Coast Bantam 
Club breed and show the chickens much like the owners of purebred dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"In the morning they crow, sure," said Maddalena, 28. "But you get used to it. 
It doesn't bother people who raise them." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Bantam Club and other poultry associations say they are 
mobilizing to oppose the zoning amendment. They have gained support from Walter 
Prince, a Chatsworth man who has formed a group called ROOSTER -- Rural Outcry 
Over Sexist Tactics to Exterminate Roosters -- and who is gathering signatures 
in opposition to the law. 
</P>
<P>
The chicken conflicts have been most intense in an unincorporated island of 
county territory surrounded by Whittier, Santa Fe Springs and La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the working-class district around Inez Street began filing 
complaints in 1987 against three neighbors, including one who reportedly kept 
more than 60 birds. In 1989, 45 residents signed a petition demanding removal 
of the roosters. Two of the homes, suspected of keeping roosters for 
cockfights, eventually agreed to get rid of their birds, said Lt. Fred Randolph 
of the County Department of Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
After nuisance complaints, the third chicken owner, Crispin Munoz, agreed last 
year to keep just five birds on his property, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Pat 
Brown. But Munoz had soon built his flock back to nearly 30 birds, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of like living in hell," said next-door neighbor Betty VanderHoek. 
"You would hear it day and night. One would start and then they would all get 
going." 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the district attorney's office charged Munoz with two 
misdemeanor counts of disturbing the peace. 
</P>
<P>
On June 12, Munoz pleaded no contest to the charges, paid a $150 fine and 
agreed to clear out all hens, roosters and chicken coops by July 12 in order to 
avoid 30 days in jail and a $500 fine. A hearing is scheduled Aug. 14 to 
determine if Munoz has complied with the order. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz had little to say about the conflict this week, except that he has given 
away four hens and three show roosters and is prepared to haul away the last of 
the chicken coops. "I don't have problems with anybody right now," he 
concluded.

A SLAPPER GOES TO THE SLAMMER: ZSA ZSA BEGINS 3-DAY JAIL TERM 
</P>

Zsa Zsa Gabor went to jail in a rented cell Friday to serve 72 hours for 
slapping a Beverly Hills motorcycle policeman. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian-born actress, wearing white slacks and a sweat shirt, arrived at 
the El Segundo city jail at 1 p.m. Friday to start a sentence imposed by 
Beverly Hills Municipal Judge Charles Rubin last October. She will be freed at 
1 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor's lawyer, Harrison Bull, made arrangements for his client to serve her 
time under an El Segundo program that charges $85 a day for a cell and food for 
prisoners who qualify for a weekend jail program, after a background check. 
</P>
<P>
"We found no reason to deny her," said El Segundo police records supervisor 
Fern Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
Bull escorted the 72-year-old actress as she surrendered. It was supposed to be 
confidential, he said, but when they arrived at the police station they were 
met by photographers, reporters and television crews. Bull estimated the media 
crowd at 30 to 40 people. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess with Zsa Zsa it's impossible to keep anything secret," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Gabor talked to reporters for three or four minutes before going 
inside to be fingerprinted, photographed and instructed on jail rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked around for a jail and thought El Segundo's would be appropriate," 
Bull said. "It costs about . . . the same rate as the Hilton nowadays." 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said Gabor volunteered to work and will sort business licenses while in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
The actress also said she has decided to drop her planned appeal of Rubin's 
sentence because she wants to "get this situation behind her" and "go on with 
her life," Bull said. 
</P>
<P>
"In her heart she knows she is innocent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor was convicted last September of slapping Beverly Hills Police Officer 
Paul Kramer, driving without a license and possessing an open container of 
alcohol -- a flask of Jack Daniel's -- in her $215,000 Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
She was acquitted of disobeying Kramer when she drove away from a traffic stop 
on June 14. Jurors reckoned that miscommunication may have been the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Gabor, the judge ordered her to serve three days in jail, pay 
fines and costs totaling $12,937, perform 120 hours of community service and 
undergo a psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin expressed outrage over Gabor's behavior during her three-week trial, 
accusing the former Miss Hungary of "milking" the criminal justice system for 
publicity. Gabor clashed with Rubin, calling him "that nasty judge" when he 
disallowed some of her community service time and ordered her to complete 60 
more hours.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 CONVICTED IN HUGE SEIZURE OF HEROIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three men were convicted Friday of smuggling to the West Coast more than 125 
pounds of Chinese heroin packed in a shipment of lychee nuts in one of the 
largest seizures of the drug in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
A federal jury convicted Hien Hai Hoac, Chau Ngoc Au and Choy Ngai Chan on six 
counts of conspiracy to import, possess and distribute heroin in the Dec. 21 
seizure at Long Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials found the heroin, worth more than $100 million, in a load of 
1,000 boxes of the lychee nuts from Hong Kong, Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory W. 
Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities placed surveillance devices in the shipment to track down Hoac, who 
operates an importing company in Alhambra. Hoac and Au imported the drug from 
Chan and other suppliers in Hong Kong. Chan's partner in Hong Kong is 
considered a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
All three men face maximum terms of life in prison when they are sentenced Nov. 
12.

FOOD CHAINS, UNION TALK TO AVERT STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: NEGOTIATORS FOR RETAIL CLERKS, MEAT CUTTERS AND 6 SUPERMARKETS ARE 
EXPECTED TO MEET THIS WEEKEND. CONTRACT RUNS OUT AT MIDNIGHT SUNDAY. 
</P>

<P>
Negotiators for six major supermarket chains and 80,000 retail clerks and meat 
cutters from San Diego to Bakersfield expect to continue negotiations 
throughout the weekend in an effort to avoid a strike when the current contract 
expires at midnight Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Stumbling blocks include issues of health care, wages and job security, 
spokesmen for both sides said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In balloting earlier this week, union members voted overwhelmingly to give 
their leaders authorization to call a strike. 
</P>
<P>
However, sources familiar with the negotiations said that an immediate strike 
is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
They predicted that if no contract is signed by Sunday night, union negotiators 
will probably be willing to continue talks beyond the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations involve 10 locals of the United Food and Commercial Workers 
and the Ralphs, Vons, Lucky, Stater Bros., Albertsons and Alpha Beta chains, 
which run about 800 stores in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the issues being negotiated illustrate longstanding concerns in the 
supermarket industry. 
</P>
<P>
The markets say they operate on low profit margins ranging from 1% to 3% and 
must restrain labor costs to remain competitive. That has led to low 
wage-increase offers and demands for flexible scheduling. Nearly two-thirds of 
the markets' work force consists of part-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
The 73,000 supermarket clerks earn wages of between $4 and $13.05 an hour. 
Another 7,000 meat cutters earn from $9.31 to $14.33 an hour. Both sides have 
declined to publicly discuss their wage proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations in Carson between the presidents of the 10 union locals and the 
markets, which are represented by the Food Employers Council, began in 
mid-June. Major differences that remain include: 
</P>
<P>
* The markets' desire to cut health-care costs by introducing a managed care 
system, which would reduce the flexibility employees enjoy in selecting 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
* The markets' proposal to allow more stocking and inventory work to be done by 
outside vendors who sell merchandise to the markets. The union says this cuts 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
* The union's proposal to raise the minimum work week from 16 hours to 24 
hours. The same demand was made during the last round of contract negotiations 
in 1987 but was deleted from the final compromise. 
</P>
<P>
* The markets' plan to reduce pension contributions for entry-level retail 
clerks and add the money to the salaries, which are barely at minimum-wage 
level. The markets have found it difficult to attract qualified applicants at 
the present salary range. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to ensure that employers don't take any benefits away," said 
Jerry McTeague, secretary-treasurer of UFCW Local 770 in Los Angeles, the 
largest of the 10 locals involved in negotiations. Local 770, which has 20,000 
members, is negotiating separately from the other nine locals. 
</P>
<P>
"The most significant concern for the chains . . . is their inability to 
compete with the low-priced nonunion competition that is so prevalent in 
Southern California now because of the growth of discount warehouses that are 
offering more food items," said Food Employers Council spokesman David 
Willauer. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen said Friday that the two sides have yet to discuss wages. The 1987 
contract provided annual cash bonuses and only a small increase in the hourly 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
"We have informed them we're not interested in bonuses this time," McTeague 
said. "It has to be hard cash, wages."

HOUSING WITH A TWIST: JOB TRAINING; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: WATTS-WILLOWBROOK PROJECT SITS NEXT TO COLLEGE, WHERE RESIDENTS 
CAN STUDY FOR HEALTH CAREERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A festive crowd of 200 community residents and officials on Friday hailed the 
opening of 48 townhouses in the Watts-Willowbrook area. Planners say the 
project represents a national role model for providing affordable housing and 
career opportunities to low-income working parents. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and other dignitaries dedicated the 
Willowbrook Green Housing Complex, a 3 1/2-acre project at the corner of 118th 
Street and Compton Avenue near Charles Drew University. 
</P>
<P>
"We need thousands of housing projects like this," Hahn said at the 
ribbon-cutting ceremony amid dozens of colored balloons. "This is exactly what 
America needs to solve its housing crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Willowbrook Green will be ready for occupancy in mid-August, and the developer 
by late fall will complete a 5,200-square-foot child-care center accommodating 
60 youngsters. In a unique twist, plans are being drawn up by the adjacent Drew 
University College of Allied Health to train interested Willowbrook Green 
residents for health careers. 
</P>
<P>
The $3.9-million housing complex is a project of the Drew Housing Development 
Corp., a nonprofit developer dedicated to rebuilding run-down neighborhoods in 
South-Central Los Angeles, company President Brenda Y. Shockley said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that this is a unique project because it is one of the first attempts 
to integrate child care, housing and employment together in one cohesive 
fashion," Shockley said. "This project was designed as a national role model to 
provide affordable housing for working parents." 
</P>
<P>
Each townhouse-style unit will feature carpeting, window blinds, washer and 
dryer, a stove, refrigerator and central air conditioning, Shockley said. In 
addition, every unit faces a landscaped courtyard with a toddler play area. 
There is also a community building where special events can be held. 
</P>
<P>
The apartments range in price from $575 for a one-bedroom to $850 for a 
three-bedroom unit, Shockley said. 
</P>
<P>
Curious local residents got their first peek inside the apartments Friday 
afternoon, and several said they were impressed with the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"These apartments are fabulous. They are absolutely beautiful," said Lemmarie 
McGuire of Watts, who said she would like to live in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good project," said Patricia Hardaway, McGuire's neighbor. "It is 
putting something back into our community and it will help a lot of working 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
Shockley said a management firm is screening potential tenants, who will soon 
learn whether they have qualified for a unit. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular development is reflecting the revitalization that is coming to 
the Willowbrook area," Shockley said. "It will provide something the community 
can be proud of."

WOMAN, COMPANION CONVICTED IN STABBING DEATH OF HUSBAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A Pasadena Superior Court jury spent only 7 1/2 hours deliberating Friday 
before convicting a man and a woman of first-degree murder in the stabbing of 
the woman's estranged husband, whom she lured to a park on the pretense of 
needing money for diapers. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Futrell and Wilfredo Ramos, both 28, of San Gabriel, face a maximum 
sentence of 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
A sentencing hearing is scheduled for Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial before Judge Harry Smerling, Futrell and Ramos tried to 
incriminate each other. But when they were first incarcerated, they wrote love 
notes to one another other. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert de Carteret said that when Teresa Futrell 
was asked on the stand who killed her husband, Eric Futrell, she said, "He did, 
Wilfredo Ramos." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ramos was a little more expansive. During testimony, he said: 
"Teresa did. I felt she did it to save me." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the trial, De Carteret played a taped confession from Futrell in 
which she said, "The knife went in him and it just kept going in. . . . I 
should have stopped. It was like something evil inside me just kept coming 
out." 
</P>
<P>
According to De Carteret, Futrell asked her husband last year to come to 
Vincent Lugo Park in San Gabriel to provide her money for diapers for their two 
sons, age 1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
Once at the park, the couple discussed custody and other problems concerning 
the children while Ramos played on nearby playground equipment, according to 
testimony. Ramos said he did not attack Eric Futrell, but simply ran over to 
the couple when he saw Futrell striking his wife. 
</P>
<P>
De Carteret said physical evidence indicated, however, that the two kicked and 
stabbed Eric Futrell. 
</P>
<P>
He was stabbed 13 times with a long-bladed knife that Teresa Futrell had 
concealed in a baby blanket, De Carteret said. He was also repeatedly kicked, 
and sand from the playground was thrown in his face and on his body. 
</P>
<P>
The attack was so powerful that the knife was found sharply bent and embedded 
in Futrell's body up to the hilt, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
When captured by police a few blocks away, both defendants had traces of the 
husband's blood on their bodies and clothes, testimony showed. 
</P>
<P>
De Carteret said that Teresa Futrell had first called her husband, an 
electronics firm employee, on the morning of July 9, 1989 and said she needed 
money for diapers. Instead, Futrell brought her some diapers. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, she called again saying she needed diaper money. Futrell 
agreed to meet his wife and Ramos at the park. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the two defendants did not return calls seeking comment on the 
verdict.

DROLLET WAS TRYING TO BREAK FROM BRANDO CLAN, RELATIVES SAY

<P>
Dag Drollet had been trying to extricate himself from his love affair with a 
"spoiled, unstable" Cheyenne Brando, trying to distance himself from the 
"unhappy" Brando family, when he was shot and killed in the den of Marlon 
Brando's Los Angeles compound in May, his father and stepfather say. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the 26-year-old Drollet accompanied the pregnant Cheyenne Brando to 
Los Angeles from Tahiti, Jacques Drollet said, he told his son, "Dag, stop this 
life with Cheyenne because she's not balanced . . . you will have great 
difficulties -- perhaps suicide, perhaps she can kill you, or you can die, both 
of you, because of her." 
</P>
<P>
The couple were living apart, but not soon enough, his father said. "That's why 
I'm in a mess, because I didn't do what I had to do, insist he not come," said 
the elder Drollet. "I said you're going to meet a tragedy with that girl, your 
life together smells of tragedy, it smells of death." 
</P>
<P>
Dag Drollet's father, and his mother and stepfather, Lisette and Albert 
Lecaill, planned to return to Tahiti late Friday. They had been attending the 
preliminary hearing that on Tuesday ordered Christian Brando, 32, to stand 
trial for Dag Drollet's killing. Both Drollet and Lecaill spoke to The Times 
before leaving Los Angeles.

Christian, one of Brando's nine children, was arrested May 17 after the actor 
telephoned police and told them of the killing in his hilltop house, where 
police found Drollet shot in the head. Christian later told police that 
Cheyenne had complained to him at dinner that she was being slapped around by 
her boyfriend, and that he had accidentally shot Drollet when the gun went off 
during a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man scarcely knew Christian Brando, having met him a few times in Los 
Angeles and Tahiti, the family says. 
</P>
<P>
The high-profile killing has commanded international headlines and has struck 
deep in placid Tahiti, where the two families are prominent. Brando bought the 
atoll of Tetiaroa there years ago, and Drollet, who said he served in World War 
II in a Free French naval liaison unit with the United States, is a retired 
high-ranking Tahitian official. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Brando, as an "adopted Polynesian," knows that "in Polynesia, the rules 
of hospitality are very strong, very important, very serious. When you invite 
someone into your house you have duties and obligations," said Jacques Drollet. 
"You must protect (a guest) materially, morally, physically and 
intellectually." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Brando "knew that his daughter was not very well balanced," the victim's 
father continued. "He knew that Christian Brando was bad-tempered, that there 
were arms around in the house belonging to Christian, that he knew there could 
be some friction between people in his own house, (but) he didn't protect my 
son. On the contrary, my son was just killed like a dog in his house," a house 
Drollet characterized as "a bunker with many weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Lecaill said the Los Angeles trip, on tickets paid for by the actor, was 
to be Dag Drollet's final gesture in the intense, nearly four-year 
relationship. "Two or three weeks before leaving, Dag discussed it with us. He 
said perhaps it's better they separate. What he did coming to Los Angeles was 
the last thing to help (Cheyenne), the last act." 
</P>
<P>
The young woman, who had reportedly been under medical and psychiatric 
treatment since a serious 1989 auto accident, came to Los Angeles because 
"Marlon Brando has no confidence in French doctors, no confidence in the 
clinics in Tahiti," said Lecaill. "He wanted her here for psychiatric care and 
to have her baby," and "Dag always wanted Cheyenne to go to Los Angeles to have 
her baby." 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne Brando returned to Tahiti after Drollet was killed, after only a brief 
interview with police. She gave birth to a son there last month. 
</P>
<P>
"They were living separately in Marlon's compound," where the younger Drollet 
had visited before, said Drollet. "He was sleeping on a mattress in the den 
where he was killed, and she was living in her own room." 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne had become "impossible" to live with, Drollet said his son told him. 
"I've heard her saying that she was the most beautiful girl, the most 
intelligent girl and the richest girl by her father's fortune." 
</P>
<P>
She had had "four or five boyfriends" before, "but for the first time it was 
not her who was throwing someone away," it was Dag's decision, said Drollet. 
"At that moment all her ego, all her pride was wounded." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Drollet says Cheyenne was much changed after her auto accident, at 
times "very violent in her words and her manner. She has said very serious 
things, she has hit people . . . she hit Dag, when she was in a rage." 
</P>
<P>
"We make a distinction between a slap and a blow. A blow is different. Dag 
never beat Cheyenne. Perhaps on one or two occasions when Cheyenne was in a 
rage, she was scratching him, hitting him, throwing things at Dag, perhaps he 
gave her one or two slaps, but he never beat her and nothing at all since she 
was pregnant, never," said Drollet. "Dag is too well-behaved." 
</P>
<P>
Neither family now wishes to speak to Marlon Brando. 
</P>
<P>
Lecaill said Brando telephoned them six hours after the shooting and "said it 
was an accident. We more or less accepted that it was." Once here, though, "we 
asked him to see us and he refused. It's normal if it's an accident, to visit, 
to see where Dag lived, gather his things, hear of his last hours." Later, he 
said Brando's lawyer called but by then "we knew better how it happened and did 
not want to see him." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for Christian Brando could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Both Drollet and the Lecaills said they would like tests to determine whether 
Dag Drollet was indeed the father of Cheyenne Brando's baby. He had a 
5-year-old daughter by another woman, a child who lives with the Lecaills. 
</P>
<P>
Dag Drollet's sister died in a 1973 Pan American World Airways crash in Tahiti. 
"It is strange," says Drollet, that both his children by his previous wife 
"died in the Americans' hands."

SLOWING GROWTH PUTS ECONOMY NEAR RECESSION

<P>
The nation's economy tottered to the brink of recession last quarter, growing 
at an annual rate of only 1.2%, following a revised 1.7% pace during the first 
three months of the year, the Commerce Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that the economy's actual performance may be even bleaker 
than the overall figures indicate. 
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of Friday's gross national product statistics showed declines in 
virtually every major sector: Spending by individuals and business shrank at an 
annual rate of 2.2%, net exports plunged sharply, business investment fell at a 
6.1% annual rate and home building plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
Only an unexpectedly large buildup of unsold inventories on auto lots, in 
warehouses and on retail shelves kept the nation's total output from declining 
between March and June. And analysts say a large accumulation of unsold goods 
often is a prelude to a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"These numbers make the economy weaker than even some of us bears have been 
saying," said Irwin L. Kellner, economist for Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New 
York. "Inventories are up and sales are down, and there's no sign of things 
getting better out there." 
</P>
<P>
Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co., agreed. "All the important 
factors declined, and the inventory swing is the only thing that produced a 
positive statistic," he said. "Without the inventories, the economy in this 
quarter really would be in recession." 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts suggested that the grim figures on Friday might push the 
independent Federal Reserve Board closer toward a relaxation of money and 
credit policies. The Fed has been under pressure from the White House to push 
interest rates down but so far has demurred. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the GNP price index -- the broadest measure of inflation -- 
eased during the quarter, showing inflation slowing to an annual rate of 4.1% 
during the period, down from a 6.1% pace during the first three months of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's new figures do not yet show the economy in a recession. Before any 
slowdown can qualify for that label, output must decline for two consecutive 
quarters. So far, the economy is continuing to grow, although the pace is 
somewhat slower than previously was believed. 
</P>
<P>
But revised computations showed the economy grew more slowly during the first 
three months of this year than the department initially reported -- at a 1.7% 
annual rate, rather than a 1.9% pace. 
</P>
<P>
And revised figures showed the growth rate in late 1989 actually was 0.3%, not 
the 1.1% rate that had been published in the previous report. 
</P>
<P>
The department made public also an annual revision showing that the economy has 
grown at annual rates of less than 2% in each of the last five quarters -- 
which it said constituted the longest string of very slow growth on record. 
</P>
<P>
Sinai noted that the string of slow-growth quarters, since March, 1989, is 
unprecedented since World War II. Since the first quarter of 1989, the economy 
has grown, quarterly, at annual rates of 1.6%, 1.7%, 0.3%, 1.7% and 1.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Giulio Martini, economist for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. of New 
York, took issue with the suggestion that the economy may be on the brink of a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
Martini argued in a telephone interview that, because inventories have been 
growing below the long-term trend for several quarters now, the second-quarter 
increase merely constitutes "a correction." 
</P>
<P>
Excluding agriculture, he noted, business inventories fell at annual rates of 
$29.9 billion at the end of last year and in the first quarter of 1990, and 
they declined $7.8 billion in all of 1989 and $2.2 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the last year of strong growth before the stock market crash in the 
fourth quarter of that year, inventories rose by $20.7 billion -- all after 
adjustment for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Martini suggested that some of the numbers in Friday's report on consumer 
spending seemed unlikely to be an accurate reflection of reality. 
</P>
<P>
The report, an estimate of growth based in many cases on only two months' 
statistics, suggests that spending on food declined steadily in real terms over 
the last year, even though the nation's population increased.

STATE BUDGET DEAL RAISES TAXES, FEES BY $850 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
IMPASSE: AGREEMENT BETWEEN DEUKMEJIAN AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERS CALLS FOR $2.3 
BILLION IN SPENDING CUTS. BUT PASSAGE IS NOT ASSURED AS THE LEGISLATURE BALKS.

<P>
Prolonged budget negotiations between Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative 
leaders came to an end Friday with an agreement that calls for roughly $2.3 
billion in spending cuts, nearly $850 million in tax and fee increases and 
enactment of legislation giving governors broad new authority to make budget 
cuts in future years. 
</P>
<P>
But passage of the agreement, which came on the 27th day the state had operated 
without a budget, is not assured. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Senate and the Assembly met Friday evening to consider the spending 
and tax package, contained in at least 20 separate bills. The Senate adjourned 
without action and is to reconvene today. The Assembly met into the night, with 
Republicans saying they found the tax increases hard to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached between Deukmejian and the Legislature's 
four top leaders, most of the cuts will be contained in legislation now before 
the Legislature; Deukmejian is expected to trim an estimated $400 million with 
his line-item veto. 
</P>
<P>
Among the political difficulties is the governor's insistence on freeing state 
funds to construct two Los Angeles County prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, even as he joined legislative negotiators in announcing the 
agreement, vowed that he would not sign the $55-billion state budget unless the 
Los Angeles County prison construction legislation was approved. 
</P>
<P>
But Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said he would support Los 
Angeles Democrats in opposing the measure. One potential problem was eliminated 
when negotiators decided to put the prison question in a separate bill 
requiring only a 41-vote majority in the Assembly, making it easier to win 
approval for construction. If it had been in the main budget bill, it would 
have required 54 votes, or a two-thirds majority, in order to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) accused Deukmejian of 
"blackmailing the Legislature" into voting for the prison by linking the issue 
to the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, in forging the agreement, yielded to Democrats on tax and fee 
increases and failed in efforts to cut public school spending. Initially, 
Deukmejian had insisted that the entire $3.6-billion gap between what the state 
expects to take in this year and projected budget expenditures could be bridged 
through spending reductions. One of his proposals was an $800-million cut in 
public schools funds, almost exactly the amount of the tax and fee package. 
</P>
<P>
But the Republican governor received support for an automatic spending 
reduction formula that can be used in coming years to avoid prolonged 
stalemates. It would give future governors the authority to make up to 4% in 
cuts in most state programs, including those now protected by law, whenever 
projected expenditures exceed revenues by at least one-half of 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing the agreement at a Capitol news conference, Deukmejian said the 
so-called "trigger" mechanism, had it been in place this year, would have given 
him far more flexibility in dealing with a gap of roughly $3.6 billion between 
revenues and projected state operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, (future governors and legislatures) won't be faced with it, but in 
the event that they are they will have more flexibility than we have had," 
Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
In a late development, negotiators dropped a proposal initially supported by 
Deukmejian that would have imposed the first-ever sales tax on newspapers and 
periodicals. Only 15 states currently tax newspapers, and newspaper executives 
from throughout the state had contacted their local legislators to stop the 
levy in California. 
</P>
<P>
Publishers argued that there was no comparable tax on broadcasters, that the 
tax would raise little of the money needed to close the looming budget deficit, 
and that the effect of the tax would hurt the flow of information. 
</P>
<P>
They also noted that more than $5.5 billion in sales tax exemptions are 
currently on the books and that removal of the newspaper and magazine exemption 
was the only one still being considered in the final stages of the budget 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Among those arguing against the tax was Los Angeles Times Publisher and Chief 
Executive Officer David Laventhol, who called Senate President Pro Tem David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) on Thursday. "I called Roberti just to reiterate . . . 
(that) we thought the tax was not a good thing, that it hurts newspapers, 
particularly small newspapers and that the legislation shouldn't pass." 
</P>
<P>
Laventhol said Roberti made no commitment except to say: "I hear you." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno had supported the tax, pointing to 
the inconsistency of current law, which taxes books but not magazines. "It's 
ludicrous that you can buy Playboy without paying a tax, but if you buy a Bible 
there is no way to avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
But Maddy said he backed down when the governor insisted that there be no 
increase in sales taxes or income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian downplayed the tax and fee package, noting that it does not raise 
sales, income or other general taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be some raises in revenues, which I am sure all of you in the press 
corps will call taxes, so I won't try to tell you not to call them taxes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest piece in the tax package would generate roughly $560 million a year 
in extra money for the state treasury by bringing state tax codes in line with 
changes in federal tax law enacted since 1987. The proposal contains numerous 
changes in accounting rules and tax laws, most of which affect corporations and 
partnerships by tightening up allowances and credits for such things as 
business lunches, pension fund earnings and corporate dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Various fee increases would raise entrance charges at state parks, boost the 
amount both in-state and out-of-state students pay to attend the University of 
California and Cal State schools, and tack a surcharge on vehicles being 
registered in California by persons moving here from other states. Fee 
increases would also hit water companies; new assessments would be levied 
against people living in areas protected by the state fire service, and there 
would be an increase in charges for copies of vital records. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the tax and fee proposals, the budget negotiators agreed to 
reduce contributions to state public employee pension 
</P>
<P>
funds by roughly $700 million. The biggest reduction will be in contributions 
withheld to the $33-billion State Teachers' Retirement System pension fund, 
saving the state $477 million this year but requiring escalating payments in 
future years. One lawmaker described the change as a "refinancing of the 
pension debt." Officials said pensioners will continue to receive all the 
benefits due them. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit by the proposed cuts will be health and welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
Payments to welfare recipients and aged, blind and disabled people would be 
frozen at current levels, meaning those people will be denied increases they 
were due to receive to defray the effects of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Payments to counties to help defray the costs of trial courts and health 
programs will be reduced 10% -- a reduction of about $40 million from the 
amount they received this year. The negotiators also reduced $13 million in 
financial aid given to counties for the legal defense of indigents. Various 
state programs will be cut from 1% to 5%, with the amount varying from 
department to department. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said that despite the cuts, the portion of the budget going to meet 
daily operating expenses -- including support for public schools and 
state-supported universities -- will grow by 7.6% under the plan. That is about 
$3 billion more than last year. The budget plan also contains a $1.3-billion 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the proposals for spending reductions will be contained in individual 
bills. Deukmejian said he expects to veto about $1 billion from the main budget 
bill once the Legislature approves it. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said public schools will receive all the funding they are 
guaranteed under Proposition 98, the voter-approved initiative of 1988 that 
will give schools about 42% of general state tax revenues during the 1990-91 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The budget negotiations were conducted against the backdrop of increasing legal 
and financial pressure. The only bills that have been paid since July 1, the 
start of the 1990-91 fiscal year, are those the state has had to pay under the 
threat of court order. California Department of Transportation workers and 
legislative employees, more than 5,000 in all, missed a payday July 13. The 
largest state payroll, covering about 190,000 employees, is due July 31 and 
none of the paychecks will go out without a budget. But Controller Gray Davis 
said the checks will be on time if the Legislature approves a budget by Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The mounting pressure took its toll, according to all parties. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, during his first news conference since the intense discussions 
began, conceded that "a lot of people's lives have been disrupted" as a result 
of the budget impasse. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the budget problem this year was unique because of its magnitude 
and was characterized by "major philosophical differences" between the 
Republican governor and the Democrat-controlled Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Democrats nor Republicans seemed to be pleased with the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Assembly's 
budget-writing committee, said he was kept in the dark by the negotiators. "We 
have a governor who thinks he's Pope and only talks to cardinals," Vasconcellos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, Assemblyman William P. Baker of Danville, a leading GOP 
budget negotiator who stayed close to the talks between the governor and 
legislative leaders, said he was not pleased with the reduction in pension 
payments, which he said were being "ripped off." 
</P>
<P>
"We borrowed substantially from the retirement funds based on promises to pay 
it back later," he said. But Baker indicated he would vote reluctantly to go 
along with the package. "We ran out of time." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Max Boot, Jerry Gillam and Carl Ingram contributed to this 
story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BUDGET DEAL 
</P>
<P>
The state faced a $3.6-billion gap between revenues and expenditures this year 
in a total budget of $55 billion. During the last two days, Gov. George 
Deukmejian and legislative leaders have agreed on roughly $2.3 billion in cuts 
and $850 million in tax and fee increases to close that deficit. Half of the 
cuts will be enacted by the Legislature; the governor is expected to use his 
line-item veto authority for the rest. Here are the highlights: 
</P>
<P>
Automatic Spending Cuts 
</P>
<P>
In the future, if state expenditures are projected to exceed revenues by at 
least 0.5%, that will trigger automatic, across-the-board spending cuts of 4% 
except for programs, such as education, that have constitutional spending 
protections. The cuts could be triggered only if the director of finance and 
the bipartisan Commission on State Finance agree to make them. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes 
</P>
<P>
About $560 million a year would be raised by making the state tax code conform 
with changes in federal law since 1987 by tightening allowances and credits for 
such things as business lunches, pension-fund earnings and corporate dividends. 
</P>
<P>
A plan was dropped to impose the sales tax on newspapers and periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
Fees 
</P>
<P>
Approximately $75 million would be raised by imposing a $300 one-time fee on 
out-of-state vehicles that are registered for the first time in California, and 
$10.6 million would come from increasing non-resident student tuition at the 
University of California by $617 and at California state universities by $500. 
</P>
<P>
Cost-of-Living Adjustments 
</P>
<P>
A savings of $259 million would be realized by suspending automatic 
cost-of-living increases, expected to be 4.6%, for Medi-Cal and welfare 
recipients and in-home care workers. A family of three, instead of receiving a 
$32-per-month increase, would receive only the present $726. Another $60.7 
million would be saved by suspending the cost-of-living adjustment for trial 
court funding. 
</P>
<P>
Pension Funds 
</P>
<P>
Reducing the state's contribution to three large pension funds -- Public 
Employees Retirement System, the state Teachers Retirement System, and the UC 
Retirement System -- would gain the state $700 million. The amount would be 
made up by increased contributions in the future. Pensioners are assured no 
interruption in benefit checks. 
</P>
<P>
Education 
</P>
<P>
A savings of $68 million is forecast by redefining the way average daily 
attendance at local schools is calculated and reducing state funds accordingly. 
The governor dropped a plan to reduce the 42% of the budget that schools will 
get as a result of Proposition 98. Education spending will grow by 4.7%

LOUISIANA GOVERNOR VETOES STRICTEST U.S. ABORTION BILL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer on Friday vetoed the nation's most restrictive 
abortion bill, saying the measure was insensitive to the rights of rape 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
The veto was a major setback to anti-abortion activists who had hoped the bill 
might lead to a test of the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Roemer, who describes himself as "pro-life," said the bill "does not meet even 
the minimum standards set by me long ago." And he went on to criticize the 
state legislators who rushed the anti-abortion bill through by grafting it to 
another that banned flag burning. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would have prohibited abortions except to save the life of the mother, 
and in cases of aggravated rape and incest reported to police and a physician 
no more than a week after they occured. Doctors who performed illegal abortions 
could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The veto marked yet another chapter in this state's highly-charged controversy 
over the abortion issue. Earlier in the legislative session Roemer had vetoed 
an even tougher bill that would have allowed an abortion only to save the life 
of the mother. An attempted override failed by only three votes. 
</P>
<P>
And it also marked the second time this year that anti-abortion forces have 
been thwarted by a Democratic governor they had long considered an ally. In 
March, Gov. Cecil D. Andrus of Idaho vetoed anti-abortion legislation that also 
presented a direct challenge to Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
"In both cases, we've had a betrayal by a governor who has been on the record 
as pro-life," said Burke Balch, the state legislative director of the National 
Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest anti-abortion organization. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion legislators in Louisiana said that they would attempt to call a 
special session Aug. 18 to attempt a veto override, and might even attempt to 
revive the first, tougher bill. But the majority of both houses must agree by 
mail to such a meeting, and no special session to override a veto has ever been 
held in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's (the governor) trying to play all sides and I think politically 
it will catch up with him," said State Sen. Mike Cross, a leader of the 
anti-abortion contingent in the Legislature. "He's playing wishy-washy with the 
people of this state." 
</P>
<P>
Those who favor legal abortion were elated with the veto. "There's an old 
saying that says oppression against men is a tragedy, oppression against women 
is a tradition," said Terri Bartletti, the executive director of Planned 
Parenthood in Louisiana. "By the governor's veto today he is saying that he is 
tired of that tradition and that he is ready for a new one for the men and 
women of Louisiana." 
</P>
<P>
But Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action 
League, noted that with the recent retirement of liberal Supreme Court justice 
William J. Brennan Jr., "the right to choose is really hanging by a very 
fragile thread. We won this particular skirmish, but it's a very long war." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Supreme Court indicated last year that it is willing to allow states 
more leeway in restricting abortion, 350 bills proposing new abortion limits 
have been introduced in 41 state legislatures, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Roemer said his office had been deluged with thousands 
of letters and telephone calls, and that "neither extreme served their case 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Despite protests to the contrary by anti-abortion legislators, Roemer said he 
was asking no more than he did five months ago when he outlined what kind of a 
bill he would sign. 
</P>
<P>
He said, among other things, that a seven-day period for reporting a rape was 
unreasonable and that the bill did not take "simple rape" into account at all, 
defined as situations where a woman is incapable of resisting, such as when she 
is drunk or drugged or mentally incapacitated. 
</P>
<P>
"Forcing a rape victim to report to law enforcement officials and seek medical 
treatment, all within seven days of a crime, is an onerous burden," he said. 
"Under this bill, sheer trauma or ignorance would force a woman to bear and 
give birth to a child conceived in brutality." 
</P>
<P>
Roemer also said the vetoed bill was too vague and did not answer such 
questions as who, besides the doctor, might be held liable if an abortion is 
performed. The liability could be interpreted to include relatives who, for 
instance, paid for the operation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roemer said that he came to his decision after paying more attention to what 
women were telling him. 
</P>
<P>
"They deserve to be listened to," said Roemer. "This (Legislature) did not 
listen at all." Only three of the 144 state legislators are women. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the anti-abortion bill had passed into law, both sides agree that it 
could have taken years to reach the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
In previous cases, the court has upheld relatively modest restrictions on 
abortion, but it has stopped short of overturning Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has urged restraint until the court has been 
presented with a case where "the constitutional validity of a state's abortion 
statute actually turns on the constitutional validity" of Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents conceded that, with Roemer's veto Friday, no such case 
appears on the horizon unless there is an override by the Legislature later in 
the summer.

IN THE END, JURY GAVE IN TO CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 15 days the jurors sat in a cramped room on the 11th floor of the 
courthouse, wading through reams of conflicting testimony. They weighed the 
children's fanciful flights of imagination against their testimony of 
unspeakable acts, and wrestled endlessly with unfamiliar legal and medical 
definitions, not to mention each other. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the jurors in the McMartin Pre-School case came away with more 
questions than answers -- "hopelessly and irreversibly hung on all counts" as 
to the guilt of Ray Buckey, accused of eight counts of molestation involving 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as they tried to dissect their feelings, they reached one of the few 
unanimous moments in their jury duty -- expressing frustration that they could 
not close the book on a case that has haunted so many for so long, and the 
helplessness they say they felt because there was not enough solid testimony 
and evidence to reach a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman Richard Dunham, 38, wearily summed it up: "We tried very hard. I 
feel disappointed . . . like we failed." 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference attended by all 12 and in subsequent interviews, the 
jurors described their confused and groping efforts to make sense of a judicial 
riddle that had baffled one previous jury. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dunham: "There was no blue (language) or pounding tables or throwing 
things, just raised voices. There were even a few light moments -- not anything 
to do with the case -- but to break the tension." 
</P>
<P>
But Dunham said nothing seemed to bring their divergent views together. "We had 
jurors who remained on both sides of the fence from start to finish. Some 
jumped around as late as early (Friday) morning," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all over the map." 
</P>
<P>
Most jurors concluded that children had been molested. But they were divided 
over who had done it. They said the prosecution's case was crippled by 
controversial interviews with the children, an echo of the original trial that 
also had focused on the Children's Institute International controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days of the trial, the jurors said they felt that Buckey must have 
done something. But as a parade of therapists, parents, children and the 
defendant himself took the stand, their perceptions dissolved into uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
They seemed most troubled by the way therapists interviewed the children about 
the alleged molestations -- evidence that was central to the entire case. Some 
jurors said they believed the children were coaxed into reaching the 
conclusions that they did. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept asking children questions and leading them until they got what they 
wanted to hear," said juror Lloyd Issacson, 64, a Treasury Department official. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court jurors in Buckey's first molestation trial agreed that the 
techniques of the therapists left much to be desired. But they reached a 
slightly different conclusion on Buckey's role. Most said they felt Buckey had 
molested the children, but that the prosecution's case was not proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, jurors in the first trial acquitted Buckey on 40 counts but were 
unable to reach a conclusion on the remaining 13. Ultimately, Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner decided to retry Buckey on eight counts. 
</P>
<P>
In this retrial, the jury managed to reach a verdict on two charges, both 
acquittals. However, after a rereading of testimony by a key prosecution 
medical witness, they began butting heads again, changing positions until there 
was no consensus. 
</P>
<P>
The final tally showed the jury leaning toward conviction on one count by a 
vote of 8 to 4 and split evenly on a second count. On the remaining six counts, 
the jury clearly leaned toward acquittal, casting votes that ranged from 7 to 5 
on one count, to 11 to 1 on three others. 
</P>
<P>
After 11 days of deliberations and two ballots, the jurors told Superior Court 
Judge Stanley Weisberg that they were deadlocked. He sent them back in hopes 
that another look at the evidence would break the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, after spending several days more listening to testimony being reread 
to them by a court clerk, they found themselves further apart than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We went back to deliberate and went the opposite direction. We got more hung 
than less hung," said Dunham. 
</P>
<P>
One juror, Mary Scott, 51, a medical technician, described it as 
"excruciating," especially the attempts to untangle the meaning of legal terms. 
"For one thing, we didn't know the law and had to do the best we could, which 
isn't good enough." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the jurors said they accepted the defense notion that children do lie. 
One juror, discussing the testimony of one child about bubble baths taken in a 
costume shop, noted that the child was unable to make eye contact with Buckey's 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Said juror Michael Carapella, a 25-year-old musician: "Because we did not have 
(information) we needed, I could explain away everything." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were especially appalled that the interviews conducted by therapists 
from Children's Institute International were done so badly. Some expressed 
concern that the therapists cut the children off when they were making 
spontaneous revelations. 
</P>
<P>
"The (institute's) tapes were terrible," said juror Silvia Scrigna, 30, a bank 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle arose, jurors said, during "endless and agonizing" discussions 
over the medical definition of "vaginal area." 
</P>
<P>
Issacson said he was especially troubled by the contrast between the testimony 
of the prosecution's medical expert, Astrid Heger, and the girls' own 
pediatricians. Heger said all the children showed signs of anal and vaginal 
scarring consistent with molestation. The girls' own physicians said they found 
no such evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the children testified that Buckey had used his finger to penetrate 
them. The jurors, in turn, said that during deliberations they even measured 
each other's fingers to try to determine if what was described in testimony was 
physically possible. 
</P>
<P>
During the last hours of deliberations, there was "an atmosphere of futility," 
Carapella said. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Scott added: "We had to do the best we could, and that's really, frankly, 
not good enough -- to be deciding the outcome of either side's life." 
</P>
<P>
Said Issacson in conclusion: "I don't think you could ever get 12 people 
together who could make a unanimous decision on this."

POLITICS / THE MAYOR FROM MERRILL LYNCH; 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN'S NEW YORK-TRAINED MAVERICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
IZUMO, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tetsundo Iwakuni, 54, two years ago was offered a new job for about a fifth of 
the $500,000 he was making as a senior vice president at Merrill Lynch Capital 
Markets in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
He took it. 
</P>
<P>
From the world of high finance and a luxurious condominium in New York, Iwakuni 
moved to the world of low-level countryside politics. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor of this city of 83,000 people, he is in charge of implementing an 
annual budget that, he says, amounts to "about half as much as we handled at 
Merrill Lynch in 3 1/2 minutes." Yet, he has gained greater prominence than he 
ever had before. 
</P>
<P>
Iwakuni exercised influence only within the financial circles in which he moved 
for the first 30 years of his adult life -- 21 of them in New York, London and 
Paris. Now, he has become a national hero -- a man who forsook riches and 
international prestige to repay a debt to the community that sent him off on 
scholarships to elitist Tokyo University from an impoverished childhood. Hardly 
a week passes in which he isn't featured in Japanese or foreign media talking 
about the closed nature of Japanese society, his concerns that U.S.-Japan 
economic frictions are worsening, the more active role he wants Japan to play 
in the world and the need he sees for reform in Japanese politics and 
government administration. 
</P>
<P>
THE OLD PROBLEMS: Under Japan's centralized form of government, Izumo, like 
other non-metropolitan cities, suffers from a lack of sufficient revenue. 
Nearly two-thirds of the budget comes from national and prefectural government 
subsidies -- which means that the city needs to beg to carry out any innovation 
that costs money. 
</P>
<P>
"It took 11 years to get approval to elevate the railway (that splits the 
city), and it will take 10 years to carry out that construction. One project -- 
20 years!" lamented Hideo Fukuma, president of the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"We are used to that, but Iwakuni isn't," Fukuma added. 
</P>
<P>
"The system of concentrating everything on Tokyo is very strong. . . . Iwakuni 
is trying to break that system," said Yoshio Kamata, a city councilman whose 
Socialist Party, as well as two other opposition groups, joined the ruling 
Liberal Democratic Party in urging Iwakuni to run for mayor in an election in 
March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
His first act as mayor was to tell the city's bureaucrats -- like most civil 
servants in Japan, a haughty crowd -- that "administrative service should be 
the largest service industry." 
</P>
<P>
THE NEW STYLE: Criticizing corruption and "money politics," Iwakuni declared 
that he would not attend weddings or funerals or give gifts to constituents. He 
stressed environment by employing the first municipal tree doctors in Japan. He 
boosted city subsidies to nurseries -- "even in our city, there is a shortage 
of women workers," he said -- and named more women to city advisory boards. 
</P>
<P>
"Previous mayors were bosses of Izumo and were chosen by bosses linked by blood 
relationships and school ties. Politics was carried out in closed rooms. 
Policies emerged not from the 80,000 citizens but from a handful of political 
bosses," said Kamata, whose Socialist Party holds only three of the 30 city 
council seats. Iwakuni said he found Izumo no less provincial than when he left 
it more than 30 years ago, despite a four-year-old sister-city arrangement with 
Santa Clara, Calif. True, more people are studying English, and "half of my 
(high school) classmates have been to foreign countries. Thirty years ago, the 
number was zero," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But are the people very open-minded? No. If you look at (former Prime Minister 
Noboru) Takeshita (a native of Izumo), you'll see the typical conservative 
politician in Japan," Iwakuni said. 
</P>
<P>
As a taxpayer in New York City, a visiting professor at the University of 
Virginia, a recipient "every Monday by express mail" of Merrill Lynch research 
reports and as a father of two daughters who live in the United States, 
Iwakuni's U.S. ties remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was Iwakuni's move from New York to Izumo that astonished Japan, 
his most revolutionary decision came in 1977 when he resigned from a promising 
career with Nikko Securities to join Morgan Stanley. He switched to Merrill 
Lynch in l984 and served as president and chairman of Merrill Lynch Japan -- 
winning the first seat held by a foreign firm on the Tokyo Stock Exchange -- 
before going to New York in l987. 
</P>
<P>
"Separating from Nikko Securities meant separating from Japan society. . . . 
Leaving a company? It's almost like saying goodby to God, for a Japanese," 
Iwakuni said.

POLIO'S END IN AMERICAS SEEN BY 1991; 
</P>
<P>
ONLY THREE CASES OF THE DISEASE HAVE BEEN DETECTED SO FAR THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buoyed by substantial progress in recent months, Pan American Health 
Organization officials remain cautiously optimistic that they can achieve their 
goal of eradicating polio from the Western Hemisphere by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, only three cases of the feared crippler of children have been 
confirmed -- one in Mexico, one in Ecuador and one in Peru. Another 10 cases 
are classified as "polio compatible," which means there is not enough evidence 
to definitely exclude the diagnosis. About 500 cases of polio-like illnesses 
remain under investigation; more than two-thirds are in Brazil, Chile, Colombia 
or Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Things look good. . . . People are confident that the goal will be achieved," 
said Dr. John Andrus, a medical epidemiologist with the Washington, D.C.-based 
international health agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Pan American Health Organization launched its polio eradication campaign 
for the Americas in 1985. The group hoped that announcing a concrete goal would 
spur fund-raising efforts and motivate health officials. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign could still be derailed by a number of factors, Andrus said. These 
include wars, ineffective batches of vaccine or persistent transmission of the 
virus in the areas of greatest concern -- northwestern Mexico and the northern 
Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
Through immunization, many Western nations, including the United States, appear 
to have eliminated the natural polio virus. But the virus is still responsible 
for more than 250,000 cases of paralysis worldwide each year, primarily in 
Africa and Asia, where the vaccine is not as widely used. 
</P>
<P>
For an infectious disease to be eradicated, not simply controlled, the natural 
transmission of the virus that causes it must be halted. Then, this result must 
be confirmed over several years. So far, the only human germ eradicated 
worldwide is smallpox. 
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization's goal is to eradicate polio from the world by 
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Smallpox eradication was aided by the fact that people infected with the virus 
almost always became sick and developed a rash. Polio cases, by comparison, 
must be confirmed in the laboratory, and most infections are asymptomatic. 
</P>
<P>
The polio virus can easily be transmitted through food and water contaminated 
with human feces, as well as close person-to-person contact. 
</P>
<P>
The first step toward global eradication of polio is success in the Western 
Hemisphere. The nearly $50-million campaign by the Pan American Health 
Organization has relied on several strategies: 
</P>
<P>
National vaccination days, in which health workers try to immunize each child 
up to age 5 against polio and other childhood illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Intensive surveillance of potential cases, including comprehensive reporting of 
unexplained cases of paralysis, particularly in children. 
</P>
<P>
"Mop-up" operations, in which public health workers go house-to-house in 
high-risk areas and immunize all children under age 5. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, 130 polio cases were confirmed in the Americas. But much of the 
decrease so far this year can be explained by a change to more stringent 
criteria for diagnosing cases. 
</P>
<P>
If the new classification system had been used last year, only 24 of the 130 
cases -- those in which the virus was isolated from stool specimens -- would 
have been classified as confirmed, Andrus said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if success appears at hand by December, the Pan American Health 
Organization will not certify polio eradication until three years after the 
onset of the last case.

ENOUGH ALREADY -- HUNGARY WANTS VOTERS TO STAY AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: REFERENDUM ON WHETHER THE PRESIDENT IS ELECTED OR APPOINTED WOULD BE 
THE FOURTH IN EIGHT MONTHS. 
</P>

BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new democratic leaders of Hungary are hoping that apathy emerges as the 
winner in a referendum Sunday that will determine whether the president is 
elected by the people or appointed by Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The referendum, called reluctantly by officials bored by the prospect of 
another election, asks voters to go to the polls for the fourth time in eight 
months to settle an issue that could be labeled the Socialists' last stand. 
</P>
<P>
Unless at least half of Hungary's 7.8 million eligible voters cast their 
ballots, the campaign for direct elections will fail. 
</P>
<P>
That allows opponents to have their say by sleeping in or going to the beach, 
while supporters will have to forgo Sunday outings to answer a question they 
have already been asked. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's former Parliament promised direct presidential elections last 
October, and voters endorsed the idea a month later in the first national 
plebiscite in the country's postwar history. 
</P>
<P>
Both the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum and the opposition Alliance of 
Free Democrats oppose direct presidential elections, primarily because former 
Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth, a Socialist, is considered most likely to win the 
post in a popular vote. 
</P>
<P>
Nemeth continues to rank as one of Hungary's most respected politicians despite 
political changes that have transferred power from the Socialists (formerly the 
Communists) to a center-right coalition headed by Prime Minister Jozsef Antall 
of the Democratic Forum. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that the Socialists complained was in violation of the will of the 
people, the Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats worked out a 
behind-the-scenes deal in May to install writer Arpad Goncz as interim head of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
The two biggest parties then railroaded through a constitutional amendment 
giving Parliament the power to name the president, effectively canceling plans 
for a direct public election. 
</P>
<P>
The Free Democrats had earlier pushed for popular election of the president, 
hoping, like the Socialists, to capture a position that could boost their 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
Head of state in Hungary is mostly a ceremonial post, but one that carries 
considerable prestige. More importantly, the president is seen as above the 
fray of day-to-day decision-making that in the turbulent transition to a market 
economy could backfire and discredit the governing party. 
</P>
<P>
Goncz is a Free Democrat and a respected veteran of the 1956 Hungarian uprising 
against communism, making him acceptable to all major political forces. His 
appointment May 2 served to buy the Free Democrats' support in the concerted 
effort to ensure that the Socialists do not regain any position of prominence. 
</P>
<P>
Communist reformers guided Hungary through the transition from dictatorship to 
democracy, then last fall disbanded the political party discredited by 
submission to the Soviets and reshaped themselves into the Hungarian Socialist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Although Socialists such as Nemeth and Imre Pozsgay are credited with bringing 
about Hungary's "revolution from above," the party won little public gratitude 
during the parliamentary votes in March and April. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign for direct elections is spearheaded by the Socialists and some 
independent members of Parliament who contend that voters have been cheated of 
their constitutional right to decide who will be president. 
</P>
<P>
They gathered more than 170,000 signatures on petitions demanding direct 
elections, forcing Parliament to set Sunday's date for another referendum. 
</P>
<P>
But the governing party's opposition to the renewed issue is clear in a number 
of complications. 
</P>
<P>
Zoltan Toth of the National Election Committee said Friday that the board is 
still searching for dozens of substitute workers to help with the ballot 
counting. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very bad time because everyone is on vacation," Toth said. He also 
complained that the referendum has been costly.

Israel and the Soviet Union agreed Friday to establish trade ties despite not 
having full diplomatic relations, Israeli officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We signed an agreement to establish economic relations. We will exchange 
official representatives in the form of trade offices in Tel Aviv and Moscow," 
said Dan Gillerman, president of the Federation of Israeli Chambers of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
He said Soviet officials are already in Tel Aviv to open an office of the 
Soviet Chamber of Commerce. Israeli officials will travel to Moscow next month, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Soviet ties have strengthened along with an influx of Soviet Jews, 
expected to reach nearly half a million by the end of 1992.

JAPAN PUTS 5.8% CAP ON DEFENSE BUDGET RISE; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE CEILING, IMPOSED BY PRIME MINISTER KAIFU'S CABINET FOR NEXT YEAR, 
IS THE LOWEST SINCE 1961.

<P>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's Cabinet on Friday decided to slow a boost in 
defense spending by imposing a ceiling of 5.8% on the increase in funds that 
the Japan Defense Agency can request for next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Although the move contrasted sharply with the absolute cuts in defense spending 
that Britain and West Germany are carrying out, it is the first time since 1961 
that the limit on the increase in an initial Japanese defense budget request 
has been pegged at lower than 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Based upon past practice, the final budget allocation is expected to fall 
several tenths of a percentage point lower than the limit for the request. 
</P>
<P>
The decision will moderate a policy of giving special preference to defense 
spending that former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone launched eight years ago. 
It also is expected to tone down a defense program that the Defense Agency is 
putting together for fiscal 1991-95. 
</P>
<P>
Although the agency insists that Soviet military power in Asia remains 
undiminished despite detente in Europe, Yozo Ishikawa, the agency's chief, 
accepted without protest Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's decision to cut 
the agency's request for an increase of up to 6.3%. 
</P>
<P>
"In the midst of the flow of hopes for world peace, is it all right for Japan's 
defense spending to stand out (as an exception to the world trend)? How about 
5.8%?" Hashimoto said. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be fine," Ishikawa replied. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in years that the formal meeting between the two 
ministers to finalize the budget-request limit did not produce a heated and 
prolonged argument. Ishikawa and Hashimoto met Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Also conspicuously absent was any reference to a need for increased spending to 
meet demands by the United States, Japan's partner in a military alliance. 
Recently, some Americans have expressed concern that Japan might expand its 
weaponry to become a military power despite repeated its pledges to restrict 
its armaments to those needed for its own defense. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum of 4.4 trillion yen ($29.3 billion) that the Defense Agency will be 
able to request is small compared to the $303.3-billion defense budget that 
President Bush initially proposed to Congress for fiscal 1991 -- a 2.4% 
increase in absolute spending. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu had instructed Finance Ministry officials not to approve defense spending 
that would "protrude" above other items in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Cabinet also followed through on a promise to the United States to 
raise spending on public works. An increase of up to 5.5% was approved. It was 
the first increase in the last nine years, since the Finance Ministry started 
either freezing or slashing spending on such projects as sewers, roads, 
airports and other infrastructure to cut budget deficits. 
</P>
<P>
An unusually high increase of up to 9.7% was granted for official development 
assistance, or tax-funded foreign aid.

YELTSIN OKS NEGOTIATION OF TREATIES WITH BALTICS

<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the reformist president of the Russian Federation, agreed 
Friday to negotiate treaties with the three Baltic republics, bypassing the 
Soviet government's central authority, Baltic officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the republic of Byelorussia, the parliament declared that its laws take 
precedence over Soviet law and that Byelorussia has the right to its own armed 
forces, the official Tass news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The developments came as setbacks to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
plans to glue together his country's 15 republics in a new confederation. 
</P>
<P>
Byelorussia is considered to be among the least reform-minded republics, but it 
followed Russia, the Ukraine and the Baltic republics in declaring its 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
While the Byelorussian parliament was approving its declaration of sovereignty, 
the presidents of the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia met in 
Jurmala, Latvia, with Yeltsin, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations between the three Baltic states and Russia must start 
immediately," the Estonian News Service said in a report on a statement issued 
by the presidents. 
</P>
<P>
"After the talks, treaties will be signed between each Baltic state and Russia 
on political, legal, economic, scientific and technical, and cultural aspects 
of mutual relations, on relations between nationalities and citizenship." 
</P>
<P>
The treaties should be ready in six to eight weeks, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Latvian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said recognition of the 
Baltic republics' independence by the Russian republic likely would be 
contained in the treaties, but it would not take effect until the agreements 
are completed. 
</P>
<P>
Signing of formal agreements between Russia and the independence-minded Baltic 
republics would be a strong blow by reformers to Gorbachev's efforts to draft a 
new agreement binding the Soviet republics together. The Baltic republics do 
not want to participate in negotiations on the new agreement because they have 
declared their intention to be independent countries. 
</P>
<P>
A Russian-Baltic accord would signal a serious challenge by Yeltsin to 
Gorbachev's leadership. It could lead to other direct agreements among 
republics that would exclude the Soviet government and circumvent central 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Latvia's parliament quoted Yeltsin as saying in a meeting with 
Latvian officials on Thursday that "Latvian independence definitely must be 
recognized in the first, political section of our treaty." 
</P>
<P>
A Latvian delegation was expected to go to Moscow on Monday to begin talks with 
Yeltsin's Russian government. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia, Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania and 
Arnold Ruutel of Estonia also met Friday to discuss their approach to the 
negotiations on the new agreement binding the Soviet republics. But no 
statement emerged.

U.S. EASES STANCE ON REPATRIATING INDOCHINESE 'BOAT PEOPLE'; 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration served notice Friday that it is willing to go along 
with a proposal to make it easier for Asian governments to return Indochinese 
"boat people" to their former homes in Vietnam and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced that the United States, for the 
first time, will accept a plan under which Vietnamese or Cambodians who have 
fled from Indochina will be sent home whenever they "do not object" to 
repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing at a meeting of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Baker 
emphasized, however, that the United States continues to oppose strongly any 
effort to return any of the boat people to Vietnam or Cambodia against their 
will. 
</P>
<P>
The easing of the U.S. position on Indochinese refugees came in response to 
intense pressure by Southeast Asian governments and by British officials 
responsible for Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, tens of thousands of Vietnamese and Cambodians have 
fled by boat to Hong Kong and to neighboring countries such as Thailand, 
Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. More than 110,000 Indochinese boat 
people are now being detained in refugee camps in these countries. 
</P>
<P>
These Asian governments and Britain have grown increasingly irritated with the 
refusal of American officials to accept the principle that the boat people 
should be sent back to Vietnam and Cambodia, even against their will. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration argues that no one should be forced to return to 
Vietnam until there are changes in Hanoi's hard-line Communist regime. Yet, 
other Asian governments charge that the United States is being hypocritical 
because American officials routinely ship home refugees who come to the United 
States from places such as Haiti, Mexico and El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, two days before Baker arrived here, the six members of ASEAN 
(Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Brunei) adopted 
a resolution condemning the United States by name for its refusal to accept 
"involuntary repatriation" of those boat people who have fled Vietnam or 
Cambodia strictly for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Friday's easing of the U.S. position will satisfy the 
Asian governments. But one senior Malaysian official said bluntly he did not 
believe Baker's concession went far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"What about those people (in refugee camps) who don't want to go anywhere?" the 
Malaysian official told reporters outside the ASEAN meeting. "It's got to be, 
'Everyone must go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Malaysia effectively abandoned the commitment made by it and other 
Asian governments to let Indochinese boat people land on their shores and to 
grant them the so-called right of first asylum. Since March, 1989, Malaysia has 
turned away more than 8,000 Vietnamese boat people and sent them back to sea. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Perhaps some boats (from Vietnam) are redirected, after they have been 
replenished," Albert S. Talala, Malaysia's ambassador to the United States, 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
In their joint statement this week, the ASEAN countries suggested that unless 
they get new help from the United States, they may all begin to follow 
Malaysia's example and start turning away the Indochinese boat people. Without 
some new solution, the ASEAN foreign ministers said, they would "take such 
actions as they deem necessary . . . to safeguard their national interests, 
including the abandonment of temporary refuge." 
</P>
<P>
Japan supported the Asian countries in their dispute with the United States 
over the Indochina refugees. Makoto Yamanaka, a spokesman for the Japanese 
Foreign Ministry, said Japan believes "that some form of involuntary 
repatriation should be worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Indochinese boat people being held in detention camps in Hong 
Kong and elsewhere in Southeast Asia have been divided into two categories: 
those who are willing to volunteer to return home and those who refuse to 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Only a small percentage -- slightly more than 3,000 of the more than 110,000 
being detained in the camps -- have volunteered to go home. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise proposal embraced by Baker on Friday first was suggested by 
British officials in Hong Kong and later was supported by the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees, Thorvald Stoltenberg. Under it, a new, third 
category would be set up for boat people who, while not actually volunteering 
to go home, do not object to being repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
One senior Bush Administration official said Friday that an important factor in 
deciding which refugees fall into this category would be whether some of the 
boat people can be persuaded, without the use of force or coercion, to return 
to Vietnam. Those boat people who physically resist a return to Vietnam still 
would not be required to go home, he indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Another senior U.S. official said there might be some form of "counseling" for 
Indochinese refugees in the camps to induce them to overcome their objections 
to going home. 
</P>
<P>
"If you add financial support to resettle them (back in Vietnam or Cambodia), 
there is a process that would encourage people who might not otherwise raise 
their hands to say, 'I want to go back,' " this Bush Administration official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also proposed to the Asian governments Friday that the United States and 
other countries make a new commitment to clear away all the boat people from 
the Southeast Asian refugee camps by the end of 1992, either by returning them 
to Vietnam or by resettling them in third countries. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary pointedly reminded the ASEAN foreign ministers that the United 
States has already resettled 900,000 Southeast Asian refugees inside its 
borders since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Baker said the United States 
has met its financial commitments by pledging $21 million to the U.N. High 
Commission for Refugees this year and has pledged to accept 18,500 more 
Indochinese refugees in the United States within three years. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials acknowledged that during Baker's private meetings Friday, his 
efforts to alleviate the Southeast Asian officials' anger over the Indochinese 
refugees met with quite a bit of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, some of them (Southeast Asian officials) said, 'We'll have to go back 
and think about it,' " an Administration official said.

SENATE OKS $54-BILLION FARM BILL; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: THE MEASURE WOULD FREEZE SUBSIDIES FOR MANY BASIC CROPS BUT GIVE 
FLEXIBILITY TO GROW OTHER PRODUCTS TO MEET MARKET DEMAND. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Acting under a veto threat, the Senate on Friday approved a comprehensive 
$54-billion farm bill that would freeze subsidy payments for basic crops and 
the dairy program for the next five years but give farmers greater flexibility 
to grow other products in response to market demand. The vote was 70 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a four-year phase-out of the honey program, however, farm bloc 
lawmakers and their allies preserved controversial quota and price support 
programs for sugar, peanuts, wool and mohair that critics said have raised 
consumer costs by billions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Senate and House measures would re-authorize basic provisions of the 
1985 farm law through 1990, expand conservation programs, halt the export of 
pesticides that are banned for use in the United States and increase food stamp 
benefits for 20 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Bush Administration have said they will recommend a veto of 
the legislation unless the price tag is lowered and provisions are adopted to 
make the farm program more market-oriented. But several farm-state lawmakers 
complained that the measure actually would erode farm income by not raising 
price floors to keep pace with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
This veto threat, however, may be a bargaining weapon during a coming 
Senate-House conference in September, where the ultimate shape of the nation's 
agricultural policy for the next five years will be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit, overhanging the farm program as never before, has curtailed the 
normal election-year tendency of farm bloc lawmakers to seek higher target 
prices, higher loan rates and other steps to raise incomes of their rural 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they decided to freeze government price supports at their present 
level for wheat, corn and other feed grains, rice, cotton and dairy products. 
The bill would raise target prices for oats, however, to encourage greater 
production of that crop. 
</P>
<P>
In one major change, the Senate agreed to establish a new program for soybeans 
and other oil seeds that the Agriculture Department opposed, claiming that it 
would cost $2.4 billion over the next five years. It also decided to let 
farmers receive higher payments if they idle more of their land in an acreage 
reserve program. 
</P>
<P>
Another major new provision would encourage farmers to switch to crops to 
satisfy market needs rather than to get government payments. The Senate bill 
would allow farmers "planting flexibility" on 25% of land now devoted to wheat, 
corn or feed grains, cotton and rice without jeopardizing future claims to 
subsidies on the same acreage. 
</P>
<P>
All sides in the drawn-out debate acknowledged, moreover, that farm program 
outlays probably would be trimmed back sharply later if a bipartisan agreement 
is reached on a plan to slash the budget deficit in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good, solid, progressive bill . . . within budget," said Sen. 
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Sen. J. 
James Exon (D-Neb.), however, said he would vote for the legislation 
reluctantly, saying, "I'm not satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said the bill carried on the same 
philosophy of the 1985 bill but at a lower cost because of budget constraints, 
adding that additional reductions would be made if a deficit-cutting package is 
adopted by bipartisan congressional leaders and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to come from a farm state and vote for less," Dole said, noting 
that the five-year cost of the 1985 bill would total about $80 billion compared 
to the estimated $54-billion price tag on the Senate-passed measure. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy brushed off the veto warnings, noting that the bill had to go through a 
conference with the House and would take its "fair share" of cuts if there is a 
budget summit agreement to reduce outlays across the board. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate action came as the House blocked an attempt to end government 
payments for honey producers in 1994 but then put off final action on its 
version of the farm bill until next week. During the seven-day Senate debate, 
Leahy and Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), ranking GOP member of the agriculture 
panel, defeated efforts to raise subsidies as well as other moves to reduce 
government outlays under the sugar, peanut and wool-mohair program. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Senate voted 64 to 32 to require banks that make 
low-interest loans to the Soviet Union to extend the same interest rates and 
credit conditions to American farmers. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also would authorize $50 million a year to promote farming techniques 
that would rely less on the use of chemicals and to set up the first national 
standard for "organically grown" food. Other provisions would extend protection 
of fragile wetlands from 60 million to 80 million acres and establish a new 
program to prevent contamination of ground and surface water on more than 10 
million acres. 
</P>
<P>
Major changes in the "Food for Peace" program were approved, including a new 
provision to make surplus crops available free to the neediest countries and 
forgive past debts incurred under the existing loan program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bill would authorize up to $100 million for a new "Food for 
Freedom" program to provide nations in Eastern Europe with food and such 
agricultural necessities as fertilizer and transportation.

The House moved Friday to wipe an anachronism off its rule book, kicking out a 
provision requiring Congress to adjourn by July 31 every year unless the nation 
is at war. The rule, which has been ignored for years, also faces a Senate

BUSH SAYS SOUTER HOLDS 'BROAD' SENATE SUPPORT; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE WITH THE NOMINEE, WHO STAYS SILENT, THE 
PRESIDENT PREDICTS CONFIRMATION.

<P>
President Bush said Friday he believes there is "broad support" in the Senate 
for his nomination of David H. Souter to the Supreme Court and predicted that 
the little-known New Hampshire judge would sail through the confirmation 
process "with flying colors." 
</P>
<P>
The President, who gave Souter a lift to New Hampshire aboard Air Force One, 
said the reaction to the nomination, which he announced on Monday following the 
resignation a week ago of Justice William J. Brennan Jr., had been "very 
favorable so far." However, he said the Senate reaction was hard to read since 
many in the Senate had not expressed an opinion about Souter. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with his public near-silence, Souter approached reporters at the 
back of Air Force One and said he had "one word, maybe two -- hello, goodby." 
With that, and a broad smile, he retreated to the private forward quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Although Souter concluded his introductory meetings with Capitol Hill leaders 
Friday without triggering any apparent opposition to his nomination, abortion 
rights and civil rights activists said they were undecided over how strongly -- 
or whether -- to fight the nomination. Leaders of the activist organizations 
had banded together successfully to defeat President Ronald Reagan's nomination 
of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, the groups say Souter's attitude on issues such as abortion 
and affirmative action are not as apparent as were Bork's extensive legal 
writings and judicial opinions, reducing the target for organized opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a coalition of abortion rights groups said they are wary enough 
of Souter to launch an advertising campaign within the next week or so aimed at 
persuading senators to draw out Souter's views on abortion. An early draft of 
the ad asks: "Is Judge Souter committed to protecting our individual liberties, 
including our right to privacy and our right to choose safe and legal abortion? 
We the people need to know. There is too much at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Heller Kamm, an official with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, one of the 
groups helping to pay for the ad, said the abortion rights organizations are 
preparing the message because there is a fear that some senators are being 
lobbied by the White House to confirm Souter without questioning his views on 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
However, civil rights groups that joined in the Bork fight are not supporting 
the ads. "We're not rushing to judgment," said Ralph Neas, executive director 
of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an influential coalition of 
anti-discrimination groups. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One, Bush denied that Souter had 
demanded, as a precondition to his visit to Washington and the pre-nomination 
interviews by Bush Administration officials, that he not be asked specific 
questions about the 1973 Supreme Court decision that opened the way to 
legalized abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, no," Bush replied when asked if such a precondition had been imposed 
by Souter. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), a close friend of Souter who also flew with the 
President, said the nominee, in expressing concern about being asked questions 
about how he would decide specific cases, told him that as a sitting judge he 
would be "very embarrassed" to be asked such questions because he would be 
unable to answer them and would refuse to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said he relayed such concerns to White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu. "I simply said, 'David would be very uncomfortable if there was a 
situation where anyone at Justice or the White House -- ,' I said, 'or the 
President -- would ask him directly how he might prospectively rule on a series 
of issues.' I said, 'in fact, John, on any issue.' 
</P>
<P>
"And John's response quickly to me, without a pause, was: 'That is not our 
policy. We understand that,' " Rudman said. 
</P>
<P>
Souter rode along with Rudman and the President on Air Force One to Pease Air 
Force Base, N.H. The President continued on by helicopter to Kennebunkport for 
a weekend retreat. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh expressed regret Friday that Justice 
Thurgood Marshall criticized Souter's nomination in a televised interview 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that it is a constructive type of attitude to have on the eve 
of the consideration by the Senate of the nomination of a man I consider to be 
possessed of extraordinary abilities of intellect and character," Thornburgh 
said in a speech to the American Legislators Exchange Council, a conservative 
legislators' conference. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, the remaining ideological liberal on the court, suggested on the ABC 
News program "PrimeTime Live," that someone other than Bush is "calling his 
shots" on the nomination. "I just don't understand what he (Bush) is doing," he 
said, adding he had never heard of Souter before the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Marshall's remarks, Bush told reporters as he was about to leave 
Washington that he has "great respect" for the Supreme Court and would have "no 
comment at all." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the White House elaborated on why Souter did not serve in the 
military. When his student deferments expired following his graduation from 
Harvard Law School in 1966, a physical examination revealed that one leg was a 
half-inch shorter than the other. He was therefore classified 1-Y, meaning he 
was ineligible for service except in a national emergency.

An unsuccessful Eastman Kodak Co. bid to make the Hubble Space Telescope 
mirrors called for a second company to double-check the grinding and polishing, 
a provision not offered by low bidder Perkin-Elmer Corp., the firm that 
produced the flawed mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Kodak's $99.79-million bid called for the company to make one primary mirror 
and for Itek Optical Systems to make an identical mirror at another plant. 
Kodak said that the different testing systems could be used to verify the 
prescription. Perkin-Elmer's winning bid was $64.28 million. The contract 
climbed to an eventual total of $451 million. NASA made the bid documents 
available in response to a Freedom of Information petition.

The Food and Drug Administration said it wants Cal-Ban 3000 diet tablets and 
capsules taken off the market because they can cause throat obstructions and 
their weight-loss claims are unproven. The FDA sent a letter to Health Care 
Products Inc. of Lutz, Fla., saying the agency would take legal action if the 
company does not stop distribution of the product, whose main ingredient is 
guar gum, which swells with water and creates a sense of fullness when eaten. 
The agency cited reports of 17 cases in which people experienced throat 
obstruction after using the product.

ELECTRIC CHAIR TESTED, USED IN EXECUTION

<P>
Anthony Bertolotti, 38, was executed in Florida's electric chair for the 1983 
stabbing death of a housewife, the state's first execution since Jesse Tafero 
went to the electric chair two months ago and the apparatus malfunctioned, 
requiring three surges of electricity before he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
Bertolotti was put to death in Starke, Fla., after the U.S. Supreme Court 
refused to grant a stay. The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals previously 
halted three Florida executions because of arguments that the electric chair 
was possibly not in good working order. But the state tested the chair and sent 
the results to the appeals panel, which also denied Bertolotti's stay request.

AUTOMATIC ROLLBACKS MAY NOT CUT SPENDING; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS BELIEVE IT WOULD BE EASY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO 
CIRCUMVENT THE TRIGGER MECHANISM.

Gov. George Deukmejian's proposal for automatic cuts when the state is in 
danger of running a deficit is likely to be approved by the Legislature but may 
not achieve the governor's goal of curbing spending on social and welfare 
programs, analysts and legislators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Some Democratic lawmakers blasted the governor's plan as a power ploy designed 
to decrease the Legislature's authority over the budget and cut spending on 
Democratic-supported programs that help the poor, disabled, and aged. 
</P>
<P>
"It sickens my stomach," said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), 
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. "It's an abdication of the 
Legislature's authority to protect poor people against a governor who has 
little regard for people in need of government services." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Republican lawmakers said the so-called trigger mechanism is 
necessary to control a state budget that is growing faster than revenues 
because of mandated increases such as the annual cost-of-living adjustments for 
welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
"The trigger mechanism is a step in the right direction," said Assemblyman Tom 
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks). The automatic cuts are needed, he said, because 
"automatic increases programmed into the law combined with the lower Gann Limit 
due to Proposition 111 . . . are driving state expenditures up much faster than 
the ability of the public to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
But independent analysts said that during any future budget crunch it would be 
easy for the Legislature to circumvent the automatic spending cuts through the 
same type of "smoke and mirror" budgeting that Congress uses to evade the 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, on which the governor's proposal is modeled. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that there is no such thing as an automatic trigger 
mechanism. It's impossible," said Rod Kiewiet, a Caltech political science 
professor who recently completed a study of the federal budget process. "The 
generic problem is that a majority-rule institution cannot bind itself to a 
future action. It can always be reversed by a majority in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Kiewiet compared the situation to a person who goes on a diet by locking the 
refrigerator and hiding the key. "But he knows where the key is. So has he 
really locked the refrigerator? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan leadership of both houses came out in support of the "trigger 
mechanism" after meeting Friday with Deukmejian, who agreed to some crucial 
changes in the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Deukmejian wanted the cuts to be triggered by a finding from the 
director of finance -- a gubernatorial appointee -- that expenditures would 
exceed revenues during the next fiscal year. The governor wanted the cuts to be 
limited to health and social services, such as welfare and Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
After Democratic legislators balked at those proposals, the governor agreed 
that the bipartisan Commission on State Finance would activate the trigger 
mechanism and the cuts would be across the board. 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos vowed not to support the trigger mechanism in any form, saying it 
would mean "the end of California as we know it." But other Democratic leaders 
said they would go along with the plan in order to end the state's 
record-breaking budget stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives the governor some face-saving crumb that may help the situation a 
little," said Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), chairman of the Budget and 
Fiscal Review Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is necessary to avert "a constitutional crisis that would have 
resulted if the governor or Assembly Republicans held firm" in their refusal to 
compromise on tax increases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Alquist didn't think the trigger mechanism would curb state spending. "You 
can't depend on it," he said. "Congress is not finding the Gramm trigger to 
have any importance -- it just stimulates more dialogue about the deficit."

FEINSTEIN SAYS BUDGET MAY TIE NEXT GOVERNOR'S HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat Dianne Feinstein expressed concern Friday that the budget breakthrough 
announced in Sacramento would just shift some of California's fiscal problems 
to the next administration in January, when she hopes to take office as 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
"I view it all with a great deal of caution," Feinstein said in response to 
questions at a campaign forum in Los Angeles sponsored by the Jewish Community 
Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The former San Francisco mayor also said that, if elected, she would attempt to 
balance her first budget without any tax increases. If that is not possible, 
Feinstein said, she probably would favor raising taxes on the wealthiest 2% of 
Californians, rather than on the poor and the working middle class. This would 
mostly offset tax windfalls the rich received during the 1980s, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's Republican opponent, Sen. Pete Wilson, withheld comment on the 
budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has proposed expansion of a number of state programs, but the only 
specific new source of funds she has endorsed is an increase in the state's 
share of lottery proceeds to pay for additional early childhood education. 
</P>
<P>
She expressed concern that the proposed new budget was "back-loaded" by 
shifting some costs into the next fiscal year. Gov. George Deukmejian will 
prepare his final budget before he leaves office in early January. Either 
Feinstein or Wilson will inherit that budget and then face the chore of 
revising it in line with her or his own priorities. 
</P>
<P>
For Feinstein, the challenge also would include budget reform. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to correct the structural imbalance of the budget," referring to those 
programs that are growing faster than the revenues needed to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to tie in revenue sources with problem-solving so that people also 
feel that their money isn't being frittered away," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be the governor -- nobody does -- that raises taxes on 
people," she said. "I want to be as cautious and prudent as I can. . . . What 
I'm going to do as governor is reinstitute a sense of trust that money is going 
to be used wisely and well and prudently, with no froufrou, but basic 
structural problem-solving."

STUDY LINKS UTAH LEUKEMIA DEATHS TO NUCLEAR FALLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fallout from the more than 100 above-ground nuclear weapons tests in Nevada 
between 1951 and 1958 may have been responsible for a small percentage of the 
deaths from leukemia in Utah between 1952 and 1981, according to a new study by 
researchers at the University of Utah and the USC Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which will be published next week in the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn., confirms the results of previous studies. 
</P>
<P>
Those earlier studies had found an unusually high leukemia rate in southern 
Utah, thought to be related to the Atomic Energy Commission's Nevada test site. 
</P>
<P>
But the new results may be more reliable because the researchers have estimated 
for the first time that dosage of radioactive fallout received by individuals 
who died of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe our current work is the definitive study," Duncan C. Thomas of the 
USC Medical School, one of the authors of the study, said in a written 
statement. "The findings of these earlier studies have been controversial 
because none was able to quantify the radiation doses received by the leukemia 
cases." 
</P>
<P>
The study involved a comparison of 1,177 Utah residents who died of leukemia 
and 5,330 residents who died of other causes and served as a control group. 
Residence histories and fallout deposition data provided by the U.S. Department 
of Energy allowed individual exposure estimates to be prepared. All of the 
study subjects were Mormons, so that residential histories could be 
reconstructed using church records. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington County, Utah, nearest the test site, the average dose of 
radiation to individuals' bone marrow was highest. Residents of major 
population centers, such as Salt Lake, Weber, Davis and Utah counties, which 
are farther away, had lower radiation exposures.

ALBERT BOWERS, 60; HEAD OF SYNTEX FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Albert Bowers, prominent scientist and chairman and former chief executive 
officer of Syntex, the Palo Alto-based pharmaceutical company, has died. He was 
60. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers died Thursday night at the UC San Francisco Medical Center after an 
extended battle with heart disease, the company announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the company in 1956 as research group leader, Bowers published more 
than 90 scientific papers on steroid research and originated more than 120 U.S. 
patents. Among his major accomplishments were developing methods for the 
selective fluorination of steroids, which helped create topical ointments for 
treating skin diseases, and developing a special synthesis for norethindrone, 
which permitted large-scale manufacture of that oral contraceptive agent. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers became president of Syntex in 1976, was chief executive officer from 
1980 to 1989 and had served as chairman of the board since 1981. Because of 
poor health, he had planned to retire July 31. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, Bowers received the Science Prize from the Mexican Academy of Science. 
</P>
<P>
He had served as chairman of the board of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
Assn., the industry's national trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Manchester, England, July 16, 1930, Bowers was graduated from London 
University with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and from the University of 
Manchester with a doctorate in organic chemistry. He did postdoctoral work in 
the United States on a Fulbright Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers is survived by his wife, Gwynn Akin Bowers, his mother, five daughters, 
two brothers, a sister and two grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to the Foundation 
for Medicine, which funds research on heart disease, in care of Dr. Kanu 
Chatterjee, UC San Francisco, 505 Parnassus, Room 1186 of Moffitt Building, San 
Francisco, Calif. 94143.

Tailback Marcus Allen returned to the Raiders in silence Friday, and defensive 
end Lyle Alzado departed with a knee injury, perhaps ending his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently unable to meet his request to be traded, the Raiders and Allen 
conditionally agreed on his return. He would earn the same $1.1 million he 
earned last season in the final year of a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility remains that the Raiders will trade him. 
</P>
<P>
Allen would say only: "I have nothing to say. You guys never understand." 
</P>
<P>
Allen did his best to avoid reporters who had staked out training camp. He 
slipped into the Raider clubhouse through a back door Friday morning and then 
went through a side door to take his physical examination. 
</P>
<P>
What prompted Allen to end the stalemate after missing the first week of 
training camp? 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have to ask him that," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "That's not my 
business. Every guy is an individual, and he has to make decisions as to what's 
best for him. Marcus made a decision not to report, and he made a decision now 
to come in for whatever reason. I don't want to get involved in that. I'm just 
happy to have the guy here." 
</P>
<P>
Allen infuriated Raider owner Al Davis by missing training camp last season in 
an effort to have his contract renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
After Davis refused to give Allen a three-year extension, Allen relented, 
returning a week before the regular season began. 
</P>
<P>
When the Raiders acquired tailback Greg Bell from the Rams in an off-season, 
Allen requested a trade to the Rams. But the Raiders were unable to make a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Allen still wants a trade, Shell said: "I don't know that. You 
have to ask Marcus that. . . . I'm not trying to hide anything, but I'm staying 
away from that particular situation. Hopefully, the guy will still be a Raider. 
That's what I want. 
</P>
<P>
"If he demands to be traded, the organization will take a look at it. But we 
will not trade a guy just to be trading a guy. We'll do what we feel is 
necessary to help our football team." 
</P>
<P>
Alzado underwent exploratory arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. Attempting 
to make a comeback at 41, Alzado had been held out of practice because of the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Shell, asked if this means the end of Alzado's comeback, said: "We don't look 
at it that way. The doctors will let us know exactly what the damage is and how 
long he'll be out. If he's a quick healer, it could be two weeks. It all 
depends on how extensive the damage is." 
</P>
<P>
Shell was reportedly instrumental in Allen's return. 
</P>
<P>
"I just talked with him last night and told him we were happy to have him here, 
and he said he was excited about it and was here to work," Shell said. "He said 
he was going to do all he could to make this football team better, and I told 
him that I'd never questioned that." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been hindered by injuries for the last four seasons, Allen, 30, 
can still be productive, Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's agent, Ed Hookstratten, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Marcus is in the best physical condition of his football career," he said. 
"His fractured wrist has healed. His speed is better than ever. It's just 
unfortunate that he and Mr. Davis are not better friends." 
</P>
<P>
Shell said: "He's always been an outstanding football player for us throughout 
the years, and we look forward to having him back this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's an outstanding player. He's a leader by example. Guys respect him 
wholeheartedly. He has the ability to catch the ball and run with it, and he's 
an outstanding blocker. He adds a lot to our football team. It's going to make 
our overall football team better." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jay Schroeder agreed, saying: "Marcus is a versatile player. He's a 
gamer. When the big play needs to be made, he's the guy that can make it, and 
that will be a big plus for us." 
</P>
<P>
Allen has made a lot of big plays during his eight-year NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
The 10th player selected in the 1982 draft, Allen was named the most valuable 
player in Super Bowl XVIII after rushing for 191 yards in a 38-9 victory over 
the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
He won the NFL rushing title in 1985, gaining 1,759 yards, and was named the 
NFL's most valuable player by the Associated Press, the Sporting News and the 
Professional Football Writers Assn. But Allen's rushing totals declined in the 
last four seasons because of injuries and the part-time presence of Bo Jackson. 
Still, he has been voted the Raider MVP four times by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Allen rushed for 759 yards in 1986 after injuring his ankle. Plagued by more 
injuries, he gained 754 yards in 1987 and 831 yards in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He missed half of the 1989 season because of injury, rushing for a career-low 
293 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
When Marcus Allen signs, the Raiders will have five unsigned players -- 
quarterback Steve Beuerlein, fullback Steve Smith, defensive end Greg Townsend, 
cornerback Mike Haynes and safety Vann McElroy. Townsend, who earned a reported 
$475,000 last season, may be close to signing. "I'd be surprised if Greg didn't 
make the trip to London," said Neil Allen, Townsend's agent. . . . The Raiders 
will practice this morning, then break camp. They're scheduled to leave Sunday 
for London, where they will open their exhibition season against the New 
Orleans Saints on Aug. 5. They will return to Oxnard on Aug. 6 and resume 
practice the next day. . . . Tailback Leon Perry, a ninth-round draft pick from 
Oklahoma, was waived to make room for Allen.

DOUBT GOES EARLY IN LANGSTON LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels hoped they had signed a 20-game winner when they agreed to pay Mark 
Langston $16 million over five years last winter. Instead, they could have a 
20-game loser. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly excited about his second visit to the Kingdome to face his former 
Seattle Mariner teammates, Langston was as prepared as he had ever been for a 
game. But he wasn't ready for his dismal performance Friday night, as he gave 
up six runs in 2 2/3 innings as the Mariners rocked him and rolled past the 
Angels, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I had better stuff tonight than the last time I pitched here," he said, 
referring to a 2-1 loss July 11. "I had better stuff than I had my last couple 
starts. I was very pumped up for this game. I was ready to turn it around 
tonight and it didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Mariners collected seven hits off Langston in sending him to his 
eighthconsecutive defeat and the Angels' fifth in their last six games. Erik 
Hanson (11-8) and Gene Harris held the Angels to four hits as the club's record 
fell to 1-4 halfway through its 10-game, three-city trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We were flat and got off to a bad start and it was compounded. That's it," 
second baseman Johnny Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing a flurry of transactions, the Angels announced after the game they 
had optioned third baseman Jack Howell to Edmonton and recalled infielder Kent 
Anderson. Howell had five hits in his last 35 at-bats to reduce his batting 
average to .208. Anderson, who was sent to Edmonton on June 30, hit .271 in 18 
games with the Trappers and had seven RBIs. That's six more RBIs than he 
produced for the Angels in 30 games before he was sent out. 
</P>
<P>
They also recalled center fielder Devon White, sending out relief pitcher Scott 
Bailes. 
</P>
<P>
Winless in 10 starts and eight decisions, since a 6-4 victory at Kansas City on 
June 5, Langston's 4-13 record puts him on track for the Angel record of 19 
losses, set in 1973 by Clyde Wright and matched a year later by Frank Tanana. 
Perhaps most disheartening for the 29-year-old left-hander is that each of his 
past two starts has lasted a mere 2 2/3 innings and has been marked by 
surrendering six runs. In his last six starts, he has given up 29 earned runs 
over 35 innings, an earned-run average of 7.46. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle, which Langston no-hit for seven innings on April 11 for his first 
Angel victory, batted around and scored four times in the first, an inning 
highlighted by Jeffrey Leonard's two-run double. Edgar Martinez added a home 
run in the third, and Omar Vizquel drove in the final run off Langston with a 
double to right, sending him to the dugout to the accompaniment of a chorus of 
boos and derisive cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard them like that," Langston said of the fans. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, he's never pitched like this. "It's a gut-check," he said of his 
streak. "I've never experienced anything like this, and it's very, very 
frustrating. I want to help this team, and I felt I would be able to help this 
team when I came here. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't work ahead very well, and for me to be effective and my pitches to 
work, I have to work ahead in the count. Then I can be aggressive. If I'm ahead 
two strikes, then I have some room to mess around. I threw some very good 
sliders tonight, but they laid off. They were going to make me throw strikes." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't throw many. "If you get behind, location becomes everything," catcher 
Lance Parrish said. "He's certainly not fooling people at this point, so he has 
to concentrate on his location. He's got good stuff. Most of the time a guy 
with stuff like that can get by with it." 
</P>
<P>
Bad as his ordeal has been -- and on Friday he acknowledged how he has tossed 
and turned and replayed losses in his mind -- Langston is determined not to be 
beaten mentally. "I don't thinkmechanically there's too much more I can do," he 
said. "I made one adjustment (in hisdelivery) that was a good adjustment. I 
just somehow have to break through. I will never givein. I will not give in." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
After outfielder Devon White was recalled from triple-A Edmonton late Thursday, 
he was in Friday's original lineup but scratched because of stiffness in his 
lower back. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a little soul-searching," White said of his 14-game Edmonton stint, 
which began when he was optioned on July 6. "I went down there and I did what I 
had to do. . . . I took a lot of extra batting practice and before I left, 
(Dave) Winfield gave me some pointers." White hit .364 with four doubles, four 
triples and six RBIs in Edmonton after hitting .213 for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Bailes, who will make four or five starts for Edmonton, took the news well. 
"Everyone knows I need to get in some innings, and the way it's been going I 
wasn't going to get them in here," said the 27-year-old left-hander, whose 
earned-run average had jumped to 6.37. "I was tense out there. When they told 
me, it felt like 500 pounds had been taken off my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels hired Tony Seigle, former vice president of player personnel for the 
Padres, to handle special assignments regarding scouting and player personnel. 
Seigle has also worked for the Phillies, Brewers and Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Mark Eichhorn, who has given up 16 earned runs in 9 1/3 innings in 10 
appearances since June 21, attributed his woes to bad habits he fell into after 
his successful start. "Because I'm not pitching as often as earlier, I got in a 
couple of mechanical ruts," he said. "I've looked at tapes and hopefully I can 
correct a few things." . . . Jim Abbott is featured as "One of baseball's most 
eligible bachelors" in the August issue of Cosmopolitan magazine. The article, 
entitled, "Baseball's most gorgeous hunks," describes Abbott as "tall, 
bright-eyed, strong and brave." Abbott took considerable kidding about it from 
his teammates. "It's a good thing they wrote about him because he needs all the 
help he can get," Chuck Finley said.

DODGERS STRAND 25, BEAT BRAVES IN 12TH INNING; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: SHARPERSON'S ONE-OUT, BASES-LOADED SINGLE DRIVES IN WINNING RUN IN 
5-4 VICTORY. LOS ANGELES SETS MAJOR LEAGUE RECORD FOR 12-INNING GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After 5 hours 3 minutes, after stranding a club-record 25 runners on base, 
after struggling into the 12th inning, the Dodgers finally edged the Atlanta 
Braves Friday night, 5-4, when Mike Sharperson bounced a single over the head 
of second baseman Jeff Treadway with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Sharperson's hit also ended a evening of personal frustration. He had gone 
hitless in his first seven at-bats in the Dodger Stadium marathon. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 runners left on is also a major league record for a 12-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides used a total of 41 players, issued 22 walks, accounted for 20 
hits, committed four errors and left 33 runners stranded in all. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Justice's ninth-inning home run had tied the game, much to the 
disappointment of the Dodger Stadium crowd of 40,907. 
</P>
<P>
The game began at an agonizingly slow pace, but the Braves wasted little time 
in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
After Dodger starter Terry Wells had walked Jim Presley to open the second 
inning, DaleMurphy slammed his 16th home run of the season deep into the 
left-field pavilion between the 370- and 385-foot sign to give the Braves a 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The home run was memorable for Murphy, moving him past Ralph Kiner into a tie 
with Gil Hodges and Dave Winfield for 33rd on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
But the night was anything but memorable for Wells. 
</P>
<P>
After Murphy's home run, Wells seemed to lose his control and, perhaps, his 
hope of filling that troublesome fifth spot in the Dodger rotation. The next 
two Braves got aboard. Then Wells got ahead of Atlanta pitcher Tom Glavine with 
two quick strikes, only to walk him, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hartley came on to turn the Braves back without any further damage for the 
moment, but there seems no relief in sight as the Dodgers continue their 
frustrating search for a replacement for injured Orel Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
John Wetteland, Mike Maddux, Tim Crews and Wells have all taken a shot. The 
result is a 1-7 mark over 13 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Things weren't much brighter Friday night on the Braves' side where Glavine 
also did plenty of struggling. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine gave up two runs in the third. Hubie Brooks got one home on a fielder's 
choice after a double by Kirk Gibson and a walk to Kal Daniels. Glavine gave up 
the other on a bases-loaded walk to Jose Vizcaino. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Glavine, who had walked a total of six over his last four starts, 
walked that many through 4 1/3 innings Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, he departed after giving up back-to-back singles to Juan Samuel 
and Vizcaino. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Chris Gwynn then got Samuel home on a sacrifice fly to left off 
Doug Sisk. 
</P>
<P>
Then the scoring went back and forth, the Braves getting a run in the seventh 
to tie it, 3-3, and the Dodgers going ahead 4-3 in the bottom of that inning. 
Justice's home run in the top of the ninth put it in extra innings, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Better luck last time: Tom Glavine was also the starter for the Braves last 
July 27th. That day, Dale Murphy hit two home runs behind him as Glavine 
breezed over the San Francisco Giants, 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
After being examined by Dr. Matthew Bernstein Friday, Alfredo Griffin appeared 
as a pinch-hitter later in the night, but he continues to have problems with 
his left eye, which is still sensitive to light. The eye injury is a lingering 
result of a fight in a Pittsburgh bar last weekend. Griffin will be re-examined 
Monday. . . . Pitchers Don Aase and Pat Perry, both recovering from shoulder 
problems, threw before the game. Aase pitched a simulated game for about 15 
minutes. Perry threw in the bullpen.

DIFFICULT DAYS FOR BEDROSIAN, WHOSE SON HAS LEUKEMIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURTIS EICHELBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, life couldn't have been any sweeter for Steve Bedrosian. His 
wife, Tammy, had just had their second son, Cody; Bedrosian was the National 
League save leader with 40, and he had just edged Rick Sutcliffe to win the 
closest Cy Young Award voting ever. 
</P>
<P>
At 30, his 94-m.p.h. fastball and notorious slider made him the bullpen darling 
of Philadelphia. It was the last good year Bedrosian has had -- on or off the 
diamond. 
</P>
<P>
The next season, he was on the Phillies' disabled list through May after a bout 
with pneumonia and pleurisy, and finished 6-6 with 28 saves. The following 
June, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants, and finished 1-4 with 17 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
But the toughest times came two weeks into this season, when doctors diagnosed 
that 3-year-old Cody had lymphoblastic leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a difficult three years for Bedrosian, once touted as the toughest 
closer in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors say 10 years ago, the leukemia would have meant Cody had about six to 
eight weeks, tops," Bedrosian said. "But thanks to medical research, there's a 
good chance he can beat it. And we believe in that." 
</P>
<P>
But all the hope in the world doesn't change the fact that leukemia is a 
painful disease. For Cody, it means at least three more years of chemotherapy 
and another two years of observation, at the very least. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians treating Cody's illness prescribe hope, faith and love for the 
Bedrosians. 
</P>
<P>
"I cried every night and I'm not ashamed to say so," Bedrosian said. "I love my 
son, I love all my sons. And I love my family. I hate to see them hurt. You 
just have to stay strong. He has to see us in a positive mode. If he sees you 
down, then he's going to be down. 
</P>
<P>
"When he is feeling good, Mom and Dad are feeling good, and that's just the way 
it is. I don't care who you are. It's humanly impossible not to think about 
that and say it doesn't bother you because it does." 
</P>
<P>
Teammate and fellow pitcher Mark Thurmond, who is close to Bedrosian, said his 
friend has handled it well. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people forget that baseball players double as people," Thurmond 
said. "When I was a rookie, it was a lot easier to play the game. Now, I have a 
wife and three kids who need love and a whole lot of other responsibilities. 
You're a human being with priorities that sometimes you can't fulfill like you 
want to, and it gets tougher each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve plays baseball, but he's also a father with a sick boy. . . . Now, which 
is more important?" 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Gary Carter said: "I think he's handled it like a champ. It's got to be 
difficult for him; you hate to have anything happen to a family member. When it 
hits home and involves your children, there's no way of knowing how you're 
going to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Giants were in Los Angeles for a three-game series 
against the Dodgers. Bedrosian, willing to discuss his child's sickness only 
briefly, took questions in the Giants' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the San Francisco players' children were also in Los Angeles for the 
series, and were playing baseball on the grass near the dugout a few hours 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
While watching the kids in right field, Bedrosian proudly announced: "I have 
two other sons, too. I have three sons." 
</P>
<P>
His eyes moved from the reporter to the kids, then back. 
</P>
<P>
"We just adopted a baby, which was in the planning before Cody was diagnosed," 
he said. "We thought about not doing it, but Cody was so much looking forward 
to it, we thought that if we didn't, Cody would think it was his fault." 
</P>
<P>
He looked back at the field. The kids were still playing, hollering, sliding 
into one another. He squinted, watching them intently. His eyes unabashedly 
betrayed him, his inner thoughts painted in his every expression. Whether he 
was imagining his child growing old enough to play with the other children was 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Concentration has been a major problem for Bedrosian this season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a good arm and he's got it going a little bit. But sometimes his 
mechanics are off and other times his concentration is off," pitching coach 
Norm Sherry said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, he doesn't really talk about (the cancer). I'm not sure what's on 
his mind all the time. He had it tough in the beginning of the season -- that 
was when they found out his son was sick. But he's a tough guy, and I think 
he's handling it pretty damn good." 
</P>
<P>
Through Thursday, Bedrosian was 4-5, with seven saves and a 4.10 earned-run 
average. He has given up 45 hits, 23 runs, five home runs, 25 walks, with 31 
strikeouts, in 48 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Phrases like: "Be strong" or "keep your chin up" or "hold up" can mean 
everything or nothing at all to the parent of a sick child. 
</P>
<P>
They can be words spoken by physicians, far removed from the real suffering of 
a family stricken by cancer. Or they can be words to cling to: "Be strong" for 
the children. "Keep up appearances" for your friends. "Hold up" so the 
grandparents don't worry. 
</P>
<P>
And also, there's: "Hang in there" and pitch well, the team is depending on 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, what was that count? Was it 1 and 2, or 2 and 1? . . . Check the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need him to get straightened out a bit," Giant Manager Roger Craig said. 
"We still think we can win, but we need him to do it. His mind is elsewhere 
sometimes. He's not concentrating like I know he can and hope he will." 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian's performance on the field has ebbed and flowed with Cody's 
condition. The youngster is presently in remission and is due for a spinal tap 
Aug. 7. His health has been good and he seems to be returning to normal around 
the Bedrosian household. As one might expect, Dad is beginning to come around 
on the field, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been frustrating," Bedrosian said of the last month. "I think I'm still 
throwing the ball well. But I think I need to be more aggressive with hitters. 
Sometimes I start walking people and then I try to aim, and they start whacking 
the ball.

"I think there's good baseball left in me. I think I can get back to that form 
again and produce a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian, who is 6-feet-3 with a dark beard and big hands, might appear to be 
gruff to strangers. But his voice is actually soft and reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to be an astronaut and he wants to be to a fireman," Bedrosian said 
of Cody. "The (boys) went to Marine World (Monday) and they want a whale now. 
They also want a monkey. You know, for the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, if they want to become pitchers, that's fine, and if they don't, I just 
want them to do the best they can at whatever they do. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I are just trying to keep things as normal as possible right now. 
I don't want to dwell on the negatives, but Cody would get better, and I'd 
throw the ball well." 
</P>
<P>
Bedrosian said that even through the family's most troubling times, he never 
considered leaving baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought of giving up," he said. "Yeah, I felt bad at first, and 
baseball didn't matter to me. But it is a test, and I don't think leaving the 
game of baseball is going to alleviate that problem. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I was in a situation where Cody needed me to be there all the time and 
it became a more drastic situation, then yeah, I'd leave, no question. He'd 
have to come first. But he's doing well now, and we're hoping for the best. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had our share of ups and downs and this is just something we have to 
deal with. Cody doesn't know it's life-threatening. He knows he's sick and he 
says his prayers every night. 
</P>
<P>
"You know? We're going to get through this."

NO CRIMINAL CHARGES FILED AGAINST POLONIA AFTER OAKLAND INCIDENT

No criminal charges will be filed against Angel outfielder Luis Polonia, who 
was accused Thursday of assaulting a teen-ager before the Angels' game against 
the Oakland Athletics at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Joe Readman of the Assault Division of the Oakland Police Dept. said 
Friday that after an investigation and compilation of reports from witnesses -- 
including Angel Manager Doug Rader and catcher Lance Parrish -- the district 
attorney's office declined to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
Don White, the Alameda County assistant district attorney who handled the case, 
could not be reached for comment Friday. However, Angel spokesman Tim Mead said 
the club was told charges would not be filed because both parties "shared 
responsibility" for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Polonia admitted that he gave the fan "a little push," after the youngster 
taunted him with remarks about his conviction of having sex with a minor in 
Milwaukee last year. Polonia is still on probation for that offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a punch at all," Polonia said. "It was a matter of being angry for 
what I heard, and I'm pretty sure it's not going to happen again. I really feel 
bad about it. 
</P>
<P>
"In Oakland, the fans were really mean to me. . . . People have been talking 
about my incident in Milwaukee since it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Readman said the complainant, whose name has not been made public, could pursue 
the matter as a civil case. HELENE ELLIOTT

PREP FOOTBALL / SHRINE GAME; 
</P>
<P>
THEY MADE CHANGE FOR BETTER

<P>
When UCLA-bound linebackers Bruce Walker and Nkosi Littleton were in the eighth 
grade, they probably didn't imagine being teammates in tonight's (6 p.m.) 
Shrine all-star football game at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
That's because basketball was their game. They played together on a 
recreational all-star team, along with Artesia High's Ed O'Bannon, in the 
South-Central Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Walker and Littleton both chose to attend Verbum Dei because of its basketball 
history. 
</P>
<P>
For one year, they were committed to basketball. Then it became clear that 
their size would suit them better on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Walker, who filled out to 6-feet-4 and 250 pounds, transferred to Compton 
Dominguez High and gave football a try. Littleton, who grew to 6-2 and 220, 
switched to Carson High and did the same. 
</P>
<P>
"They both have enough talent to do whatever they want to do on the football 
field," said Ken Sutch, who coached Paramount to its second consecutive 
Southern Section Division III title last season. He will coach the South 
tonight, along with Jim Barnett of Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Littleton is so good that sometimes you don't know he is here," Sutch said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like when you have an (A-student) and all you can keep telling him is 
'nice job'. 
</P>
<P>
"And Walker, all I can say is when he plays, it's phew! He is fast, big, strong 
and aggressive. He is just one dominant player." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA football fans are glad that Walker and Littleton have changed sports. 
</P>
<P>
"All of my life, I wanted to play basketball, until I realized that football 
could lead me to better things," said Littleton, who was a consensus 
All-American for the Colts from his inside linebacker position last season. 
</P>
<P>
Like Littleton, Walker knew that football could prove to be special for him. He 
gave up basketball after his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked football because it gave me an opportunity to let off a lot of 
frustration," said Walker, who also was a unanimous All-American linebacker 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I knew that football was my sport, I tried to concentrate on doing things 
that would help me in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
It did not take long for both players to make their presence felt. Littleton 
helped Carson win the 1988 City 4-A Division championship as a junior and led 
the Colts' defense last fall. Carson made it to the City finals, losing to 
Dorsey, 26-15. Littleton made 143 tackles, including 66 unassisted, and 
recovered four fumbles during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Although Walker decided to give up basketball, Littleton continued to play and 
was a two-year starter for the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to miss playing basketball," Littleton said. "I think I will always 
watch basketball before I watch a football game." 
</P>
<P>
While Littleton was a two-sport star during his prep career, Walker was a 
two-way standout in one sport. 
</P>
<P>
In playing nearly every minute of every game last season, Walker, who also 
started at fullback, made 105 tackles, including 65 unassisted; recovered four 
fumbles; had one interception; gained 1,363 yards in 170 carries, and scored 15 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I like carrying the ball, but outside linebacker is (where) I'd rather play 
now because I think I can go farther there," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker and Littleton did not plan together in choosing UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not really talk to each other much during recruiting," said Walker, who 
will room with Littleton in the fall. "We both had to make our own decision. I 
found out that Nkosi was going to UCLA before I made my decision." 
</P>
<P>
Said Littleton: "We went on our Washington recruiting trip together, and we 
called each other once or twice, but we never talked about going to school 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Littleton considers tonight's game as a sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
"When we are on the field together, it is like we both know that no one can 
come our way," Littleton said.

First baseman Don Mattingly was placed on the New York Yankees' 21-day disabled 
list, but the club said it's too early to write him off for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Mattingly's chances of playing again this season, Pete Peterson, 
Yankee vice president and general manager, said: "I certainly hope so, let me 
put it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said the team was waiting to see how Mattingly's back responded to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly, 29, returned to his Evansville, Ind., home Thursday.

The Alabama Journal of Montgomery reported that Arkansas and Florida State have 
accepted invitations to join the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State and SEC officials denied the report, but Arkansas officials said 
the school would announce a decision soon. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an unnamed source, identified as a "highly ranked SEC 
official," who said the two universities would join the SEC, bringing the 
number of teams in that conference to 12. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State Athletic Director Bob Goin said: "If the story is we have 
accepted an invitation to join the SEC, that's false. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. We have not been extended an offer, nor have we accepted one." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Zacharis, president of Mississippi State and president of the SEC, told 
Tupelo, Miss., television station WTVA that Florida State has not been issued a 
formal invitation.

PADRES BID KROC FAREWELL, RUN STREAK TO FIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixteen years and three months after a Kroc first addressed the fans in San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, another one did, for perhaps the final time. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Padres, the result Friday night in front of 20,244 paying 
fans on Joan Kroc night was quite a bit different than the one in 1974, when 
her husband, Ray, publicly apologized to the crowd for his new team's "stupid 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the Padres defeated the Houston Astros, 6-2, for their fifth 
consecutive victory, equaling their longest winning streak of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Following a 1-10 road trip, the Padres have rebounded nicely and are now 5-1 on 
this home stand, 11 games under .500 and 16 behind the Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while the setting of the evening was special -- what with Kroc 
reminiscing about the magical 1984 season -- the Padres are a long way from 
catching the front-running Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
If the Reds were to win only half their remaining games, the Padres would still 
have to go 49-16 over the rest of the season just to tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres realize this, and are taking things one step at a time. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Benes, making his first start in 10 days because of a tender left shoulder 
injured in a benches-clearing brawl in Pittsburgh, was impressive. Benes (7-7) 
scattered eight hits over6 2/3 innings and had four strikeouts with zero walks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Andy had a great outing for having missed two starts," Manager Greg 
Riddoch said. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, the Padres have now outscored their opponents, 36-9, in the five 
game win streak. 
</P>
<P>
As has been customary for the Padres this week, they got on the board first, 
scoring one run in the third on a double play, two in the fourth on Joe 
Carter's 15th home run of the season and three in the sixth on Jack Clark's 
16th homer. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, Fred Lynn lined a single to right for the first hit off Astro 
starter Bill Gullickson (6-8). Catcher Tom Lampkin followed that with a similar 
single to right, and Lynn advanced to third. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared briefly that the Padres were going to explode with one of those 
multi-run innings they've been getting the past three days, but Benes grounded 
into a double play that enabled Lynn to score but negated any hope for the big 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Again in the fourth inning, the Padres appeared to have a nice rally going, but 
it, too, was momentarily spoiled by a double play. Garry Templeton walked to 
open the inning, and Gwynn reached on a fielding error by first baseman Ken 
Oberkfell. 
</P>
<P>
Clark then hit a sharp grounder to second that Bill Doran turned into a double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
With Templeton on third, Carter ripped the first pitch from Gullickson seven 
rows into the left field stands. The home run was his first in 14 games. The 
two runs batted in gives him seven in his last six games and 70 for the year, 
third in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar led off the sixth with a single to right, extending his hitting streak 
to nine games, and advanced to second on Templeton's groundout to short. With 
an open base, the Astros chose to intentionally walk the hot-hitting Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
How hot was Gwynn? Heading into Friday's game, he had hit safely in seven of 
his last nine at bats, despite being troubled with a migraine headache and 
blurred vision that forced him out of Thursday's game in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
So with Alomar and Gwynn aboard, Clark ripped a 1-0 fastball over the 
eight-foot inner fence in left center field, just above the outstretched glove 
of center fielder Eric Yelding. 
</P>
<P>
For Clark, it was his sixth homer and 13th RBI in his past 17 games. During 
that time, he has increased his average to .257 from .215. 
</P>
<P>
"It's contagious," Riddoch said. "Once the old ripper gets the old lumber 
flying, everybody else starts getting in on the act." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Padres and Benes were being aided by a number of outstanding 
defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar made an over-the-shoulder snare of a flare headed for right 
field in the second inning, then one-upped that to begin a double play with the 
Astros threatening in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
With Oberkfell and Franklin Stubbs aboard with singles and one out, Ken 
Caminiti hit a one-hopper in the right-side hole. Alomar shuffled to his left, 
made a nice grab, turned and flipped to Templeton at second, who fired to first 
to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"How about Robbie's play?" Riddoch asked. "That's about as great a play a 
second baseman can make." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who entered the game with the second worst fielding percentage 
(.974) in the National League, did not make an error for the second consecutive 
game. 
</P>
<P>
While Benes zipped through the first eight hitters he faced, it was Gullickson 
that got to him first with a single that tipped off a diving Templeton's glove. 
</P>
<P>
Benes carried a shutout into the seventh inning, when Glenn Wilson hit his 
eighth homer of the year into the left field stands. One out later, Casey 
Candaele tripled, and Benes was replaced by right hander Greg Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Yelding, the Astros' speedy leadoff hitter, greeted Harris with a line drive to 
center that skipped by a diving Carter all the way to the wall in center. 
Candaele scored easily, but Yelding was out trying to stretch it into an 
inside-the-park homer. Gwynnrelayed to Alomar, who fired a perfect throw to 
catcher Tom Lampkin for the out. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Padres in attendance for the salute to Joan Kroc included Tim Flannery, 
Rollie Fingers, Kurt Bevacqua, John D'Acquisto, Nate Colbert, Gene Locklear, 
Dave Campbell, Gene Richards and John Curtis. .. . During his brief invocation 
that began the festivities, Father Joe Carroll asked fans to pray for the 
Padres, that they continue to play the way they have the last four days. . . . 
The San Diego Hospice will receive a 1991 Toyota Previa in the name of Joan 
Kroc from the San Diego County Toyota dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn, who left Thursday night's game in the seventh inning with a 
migraine headache and blurred vision, said he has been getting headaches on and 
off since college. But he said Thursday's was his worst, and he was still 
suffering before Friday's game. "It was worse (Thursday) 'cause I couldn't 
see," Gwynn said. "I can see today." He added, "This is the longest (headache) 
I've ever had. Usually, it's just when I go to sleep, and it's gone when I wake 
up." . . . Bruce Hurst, suffering from the flu, was sent home during Thursday's 
game and was unable to make it Friday as well. Manager Greg Riddoch does not 
expect Hurst to miss his next start on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros made a number roster moves Friday. Outfielder Javier Ortiz, who 
injured his left knee in a collision with Parent on a play at the plate 
Thursday night, was placed on the 15-day disabled list but likely will be out 
for the season with torn ligaments and cartilage. Ortiz will return to Houston 
today and undergo arthroscopic surgery Monday to have the torn cartilage 
removed and the ligaments examined to see if further surgery is necessary. "It 
was just a freak thing," Ortiz said. "(Parent) stepped forward, and I didn't 
realize it until (the collision) occurred. I was thinking slide all the way, 
but the ball skipped to his glove quickly and he stepped up the line." Ortiz 
said he knew right away it was a serious injury. "That's the worst pain I've 
felt in my life," he said. Infielder Rafael Ramirez, who had been on the 
disabled list for a hamstring injury, was activated and has replaced Ortiz on 
the roster. 
</P>
<P>
Slugging first baseman Glenn Davis, who had been on the disabled list and 
sidelined since June 25 with torn muscles in his rib cage, was sent to the 
Astros' double-A affiliate in Columbus, Ga., for rehabilitation. Part of the 
reasoning for him going there, as opposed to triple-A, is that Davis' home is 
in Columbus and the team is home for the next eight days. Davis, and his wife, 
Teresa, are expecting their third child any day now. . . . Alex Trevino, a 
Houston catcher, was placed on waivers for the purpose of giving him his 
unconditional release. Trevino declined the Astros' offer of taking a minor 
league assignment. . . . The Astros also purchased the contract of outfielder 
Mark Davidson from Tucson, their triple-A affiliate.

TEAM TURMOIL: COLTS NOW BOTHERED BY HOLDOUTS, HANGUPS AND LAWSUITS

<P>
One year ago, the Indianapolis Colts were talking about going to the Super 
Bowl. Now, they're a team in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Chandler, the starting quarterback when the 1989 season began, is in 
Seattle after suing the team for breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Dickerson, the team's leading rusher since he arrived on Halloween Night 
in 1987, is in California demanding a trade, seeking a raise and criticizing 
his offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts have threatened to suspend both players for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Center Ray Donaldson, a Pro Bowl selection the past three years, reported to 
training camp Thursday and then left for "personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Eight other veterans are unsigned and absent from camp, including three 
possible defensive starters, offensive lineman Randy Dixon and placekicker Dean 
Biacussi. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Donnell Thompson is no stranger to the franchise's problems, 
having gone through his own contract disputes and a four-game suspension in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here 10 years and I've never seen this much go on in the offseason," 
Thompson said. "You just have to deal with it. We have no control. We're just 
hired help. We do what we're told to do. I'm just here passing through and 
doing as I'm told to do." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he finds the turmoil frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real tough to play the game and more or less deal with everything that's 
going on as well, and try to win and try to have your heart in it," Thompson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many Colts are upset by management's refusal to pay Chandler $50,000 for 
offseason workouts. Chandler says the payment is part of his contract, but the 
team claims he doesn't deserve the money because he didn't do the workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they're treating Chris right now is kind of upsetting to everyone I've 
talked to," Thompson said. "It's just dischanting to everyone that's involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just hard to believe that we have all the bad guys in the league. It 
seems like we've got every bad guy that's ever played football. I find that 
hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson's criticism of the offensive line has the players choosing up sides. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had to run behind our offensive line, would you be here?" Thompson 
said. "He has to step back and think about some things. He wants to be able to 
walk five, six years from now." 
</P>
<P>
Offensive tackle Kevin Call thinks Dickerson has talked too much. 
</P>
<P>
"From the things that he's said, my personal opinion is we don't need him," 
Call said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to trade offensive tackle Chris Hinton and wide receiver Andre 
Rison to obtain quarterback Jeff George as the top pick in the draft has also 
divided the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
"You lose two great players like Chris Hinton and Andre Rison, that has upset 
the team," Thompson said. "Have you ever seen one guy come in and make that 
much of a difference? We just have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson isn't unhappy that George signed the most lucrative contract in league 
history for a rookie -- a six-year deal for $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad Jeff George got as much money as he did. He deserves every dollar 
that he got," Thompsons said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just now let's get Jon Hand in here, and some other guys who have made a 
contribution to the club. Those are the guys that I think we should be trying 
to get in camp. I guess everyone doesn't see it the way I see it." 
</P>
<P>
The club announced the signing of second-round draft pick Anthony Johnson of 
Notre Dame and veteran kicker Dean Biasucci. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who rushed for 1,512 yards in four years, was the last of the club's 
14 draftees to come to terms. The signing of Biasucci cut to seven the number 
of unsigned veterans absent from camp. 
</P>
<P>
The rookies, free agent signees and veterans who have been in camp for more 
than a week were given the morning off Friday while the club's other veterans 
took physicals and agility tests.

DODGERS HAVE 4-3 LEAD OVER BRAVES IN SEVENTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers' long, frustrating struggle to replace the injured Orel Hershiser 
continued Friday night with no end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Friday night's game against the Atlanta Braves at Dodger 
Stadium seemed, at times, to have no end sight either. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers led, 4-3, in the seventh inning and seemingly threatened to go on 
so long that Hershiser himself, not due back until season's end at the 
earliest, might have a chance to get in a few innings. 
</P>
<P>
After more than three hours of walks errors and wild pitches, the crowd of 
40,907, was just getting up for the seventh-inning stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The game began at an agonizingly slow pace, but the Braves wasted little time 
in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
After Dodger starter Terry Wells had walked Jim Presley to open the second, 
Dale Murphy slammed his 16th home run of the season deep into the left-field 
pavilion between the 370- and 385-foot sign. 
</P>
<P>
It was a memorable homer for Murphy, his 370th lifetime, moving him past Ralph 
Kiner into a tie with Gil Hodges and Dave Winfield for 33rd on the all-time 
list. 
</P>
<P>
But the night was anything but memorable for Wells. 
</P>
<P>
After losing Murphy, he seemed to lose his control and, perhaps, his hopes of 
filling that troublesome fifth spot in the Dodger rotation. Although the next 
two Braves got aboard, Wells got ahead of pitcher Tom Glavine with two quick 
strikes only to walk him, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley came on to turn the Braves back without any further damage, but there 
seems no relief in sight as the Dodgers as they continue their frustrating 
search for a replacement for Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
John Wetteland, Mike Maddux, Tim Crews and Wells have all taken a shot. The 
result is a 1-7 mark over 13 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Things weren't much brighter Friday night on the Braves' side where Glavine, 
the starter, did plenty of struggling of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Glavine surrendered the tying runs in the third. Hubie Brooks got one home on a 
fielder's choice following a double by Kirk Gibson and a walk to Kal Daniels. 
Glavine gave up the other on a bases-loaded walk to Jose Vizcaino. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Glavine, who had walked a total of six over his last four starts, 
walked that many through 4 1/3 innings Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, he departed after giving up back-to-back singles to Juan Samuel 
and Vizcaino. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Chris Gwynn then got Samuel home on a sacrifice fly to left off 
Doug Sisk. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Better luck last time: Tom Glavine was also the starter for the Braves last 
July 27th. That day, Dale Murphy hit two home runs behind him as Glavine 
breezed over the San Francisco Giants, 10-1. . . . No change in the status of 
shortstop Alfredo Griffin following an examination by Dr. Matthew Bernstein 
Friday. Griffin remains day to day due to continued sensitivity to light in his 
left eye, the lingering result of a fight in a Pittsburgh bar last weekend. 
Griffin will be reexamined Monday, but could possibly see action in this 
series. . . . Pitchers Don Aase and Pat Perry, both recovering from shoulder 
problems, threw before the game. Aase pitched a simulated game for about 15 
minutes. Perry threw in the bullpen. . . . Fernando Valenzuela (8-8) will face 
John Smoltz (7-7) in tonight's game, scheduled for a 7:05 start.

WOODLAND HILLS WEST BEGINS ANOTHER STREAK, 14-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Woodland Hills West got a fresh start Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After his team's 20-game winning streak was snapped Thursday in a first-round 
game of the American Legion 6th Area baseball playoffs, West Coach Don Hornback 
activated pitcher Sean Boldt, who had not started since July 19. 
</P>
<P>
Boldt went the distance but it was Jason Cohen's bat that delivered the 
knockout blow in West's 14-6 win over Santa Monica in a second-round 
elimination game at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The right-handed Boldt (8-1) limited Santa Monica to one hit in the first two 
innings before allowing five runs in the third. Like a rubber band, he snapped 
back and surrendered just five hits and one run over the last six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cohen was cashing in on opportunities presented him, the El Camino 
Real High graduate driving in six runs in his first four at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Six Santa Monica errors added more fuel to West's fire, although only two of 
the defending World Series champion's runs were unearned. Santa Monica 
committed three errors in the second inning but did not allow a run. 
</P>
<P>
The win moves West (24-5) into a third-round game today against Culver City, 
with the winner of that game advancing to the championship semifinal. 
Claremont, by virtue of its win over Camarillo on Friday, automatically 
qualifies for the Sunday finals based on two 6th Area wins in a row. 
</P>
<P>
West, which lost, 8-7, to Claremont in the first round, must win a doubleheader 
today and a doubleheader Sunday to claim its second consecutive 6th Area 
championship and a berth in the state playoffs in Yountville, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like we said, one in a row and we got four to go," Hornback said to his 
team in a postgame meeting, implying that winning five in a row shouldn't be 
that difficult of a feat for a team that already had run off a streak of 20. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's 4-for-5 performance -- which included two-run doubles in the third and 
fourth innings -- was a vast improvement over his one-for-five effort against 
Claremont on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an RBI machine," Hornback said. "You get guys on base and you like to see 
Jason Cohen at the plate. Without hitting the ball out of the yard, he played 
close to a perfect offensive ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
West scored a run in the first and added five runs on five hits -- four of them 
doubles -- in the third to take a 6-0 lead. Santa Monica returned the favor, 
shelling Boldt for five singles and five runs in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at his history, that's how it's been," Hornback said of Boldt, who 
allowed 10 hits and one unearned run. "He's always had one bad inning." 
</P>
<P>
History aside, Santa Monica's rally worried Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
"That was kind of scary. It shouldn't have happened," he said. "We did 
everything we had to do right except in that third inning." 
</P>
<P>
West scored two runs in the fourth and four in the sixth to take a 12-5 lead. 
In the fourth inning, Cohen's second double scored Paul Geller and Del Marine 
for an 8-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Geller was awarded first base after being hit in the shoulder by 
reliever Louis Kim. One out later, Geller scored his fourth run on Marine's 
triple into the left-field corner. Cohen singled to score Marine for West's 
second run of the inning. Bobby Kim followed and tagged Louis Kim's 2-1 pitch 
for a two-run home run to left-center. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica, the District 24 runner-up, collected two triples in the sixth but 
scored only one run. 
</P>
<P>
West, the two-time District 20 champion, scored a run in each of the eighth and 
ninth innings to account for the final score.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: NEW HOCKEY TEAM SELECTS OLD FAVORITE FOR NAME: 
GULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego obtained a new minor league hockey team on June 14. One month and 13 
days later, the team has been given a familiar name: the Gulls. 
</P>
<P>
Vin Ciruzzi, president of the International Hockey League club, made the 
announcement Friday, saying, "Our goal was to revive the essence and mystique 
of the San Diego Gulls." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego had three professional hockey teams between 1966 and 1979: the Hawks 
of the Pacific Hockey League, the Mariners of the World Hockey Association and 
the Gulls of the World Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls, who sometimes outdrew the NHL's Los Angeles Kings during their 
tenure here and routinely drew 10,000 to 11,000 fans on Saturday nights, were 
considered the most successful of the three. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego was able to use the name Gulls only after getting an OK Thursday from 
Bob Breitbard, the former owner of the WHL Gulls, who still owns rights to the 
name. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls will open their IHL season Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State's football team will play a two-game series against Arizona, 
beginning in 2000, Athletic Director Fred Miller announced. The Aztecs will 
face the Wildcats Sept. 16, 2000, in Tucson and Sept. 15, 2001, at home. 
Arizona leads the series between the two teams, 6-5, and beat SDSU, 42-10, the 
last time they played, in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Nomads battled to a 0-0 tie before dropping a Western Soccer 
League game to Colorado, 3-2, on penalty kicks in Denver. The Nomads fell to 
7-9. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
Manuela Maleeva, 23, ranked eighth in the world in women's singles, has entered 
the Great American Bank tennis tournament to be played at the San Diego Tennis 
and Racquet Club Aug. 6-12. The field also includes top-ranked Steffi Graf and 
Wimbledon champ Martina Navratilova.

MINOR LEAGUE REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
KARROS IN DODGER PLANS FOR NEW DREAM INFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell and Ron Cey were all groomed in the 
Dodgers' minor league system in the late 1960s, brought up within three years 
of each other and spent 10 years as the longest continuously intact infield in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
A similar foursome could emerge in Los Angeles sometime in the near future with 
Dave Hansen, Jose Offerman and Jose Vizcaino as three of the four new 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth, shooting for Garvey's role, is Eric Karros, a former star at 
Patrick Henry High and UCLA now tearing up the double-A Texas League for San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they talk," Karros said, "they're trying to do the same thing they did 
in the late '60s. . . . They talk about how they're going to try to bring us up 
together. It may be all talk, but who knows? Hopefully, it'll work out like 
that, but you never know." 
</P>
<P>
On the field or off, Karros has done little wrong in his part. 
</P>
<P>
At Patrick Henry, he was an All-County selection in 1985, when he led the 
Patriots to a near perfect season, their only loss, 7-2, to Mira Mesa in the 
title game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Karros says the defeat probably is 
his biggest baseball disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, he hit .454 in a limited role his freshman year, .312 with eight home 
runs and 57 RBIs his sophomore year and .415 with 17 home runs and 54 RBIs as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
He was All-Pac 10 as a sophomore and junior and a third-team All-American as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
Drafted in the fifth round by the Dodgers in the June, 1988, draft, Karros has 
progressed up the organizational ladder one year at a time, posting big numbers 
and championships at every stop. 
</P>
<P>
At Great Falls, Mont., a Dodger rookie club, Karros hit .366 with 12 homers and 
55 RBIs in 68 games while leading the team to the 1988 Pioneer League 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, at Class A Bakersfield, Karros hit .303 with 15 homers and 
86 RBIs in 142 games and led the Dodgers to the California League championship. 
Karros was also one of six Bakersfield players named to the All-Star team. It 
was the most players selected from one team since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Karros is second in the Texas League with a .338 average. He also 
has 10 home runs with 53 RBIs and a league-leading 33 doubles for San Antonio, 
which was tied for first heading into Friday's games. In the recent All-Star 
game, Karros went three for five with a home run, a double and three RBIs. 
Ricky Bones of the Padres' Wichita affiliate edged him for most valuable player 
honors by throwing three shutout innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's gone well," Karros said. "I'm happy with the way things turned 
out. I think I've got a good shot at the first base job (in Los Angeles) when 
Eddie Murray is through." 
</P>
<P>
Out of Patrick Henry, Karros had a number of scholarship offers from four-year 
schools, but UCLA was not among them. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have gone to (San Diego) State with (other Patrick Henry graduates) 
Scott Middaugh, Kasey McKeon and Eric Martinez. We all had our letters of 
intent, but I just wanted to get away. I always wanted to go to UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
So Karros walked on at Westwood with an understanding. "I could be on the team 
for fall ball. After that, no promises." 
</P>
<P>
He said the adjustment to UCLA and college life was eased by the help of 
another Patrick Henry graduate, Randy Hennis, who is now pitching in triple-A 
in the Astros' organization. 
</P>
<P>
Karros worked hard, quickly impressed UCLA Coach Gary Adams and was granted a 
scholarship before his sophomore year. But as hard as he had worked for that 
scholarship, Karros offered to give up a third of it before his junior year to 
help out fifth-year pitcher Mike Magnante, who was not receiving any aid. 
</P>
<P>
"He needed some aid," Karros says nonchalantly, "and I told Adams I'd give up 
part of my scholarship. As it turned out, they found some money from 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Magnante now pitches in triple-A for the Royals. As for Karros, he hopes to be 
the next Garv. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Carey, a graduate of Granite Hills and Stanford, was pictured among a 
series of articles titled "Down on the Farm" in the July 23 issue of Sports 
Illustrated. The issue devoted 56 pages to minor league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
When the picture was taken, Carey played for Clinton, Iowa. He has since been 
promoted to Class A San Jose.

SEXUALITY AND ERASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Leslie Carr's July 7 letter about Mike Boehm's review of Erasure's 
concert: I also attended that concert, and while I agree that Erasure put on a 
good show, I disagree completely that singer Andy Bell's homosexuality wasn't 
an issue. 
</P>
<P>
Having seen Erasure when they opened for Duran Duran in 1987, I was aware of 
Bell's flamboyant stage antics, but I considered his sexuality secondary to his 
dynamic performance. 
</P>
<P>
However, I was somewhat unprepared for the audience that Erasure drew as a 
headline act. In my opinion, their show was not a case of a straight audience 
lowering their guard to enjoy a gay performer; it was more like a gay pride 
festival. The rows around me were filled with homosexual couples openly 
displaying affection, and the fact that in the setting of Erasure's concert, 
they felt free to do so seems to me a reflection of Bell's openness about his 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
The reason that the audience wasn't making derogatory remarks about Bell's 
sexuality is that a great deal of the audience was itself homosexual -- not 
because they were straight people "overlooking" the band's sexuality as Carr 
suggested in her letter. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Erasure did put on an excellent show -- but their homosexuality was a 
prominent aspect of their concert, and it wouldn't have made sense for the 
review to pretend otherwise.

CHURCH'S RIGHT STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was somewhat disturbed in reading Mike Boehm's review of the Church's opening 
show at the Coach House ("The Right (Same) Stuff," July 14). Most distressing 
was not the essentially negative conclusion of artistic stagnation but rather 
Mr. Boehm's unbelievable abuse of similes. . . . "Like Bob Dylan. . . . Like 
Van Morrison. . . . Like the Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
Such blatant idolization of widely popular artists is deluded. Lack of monetary 
success is not "specialization," and is not the antithesis of mass popularity. 
Wake up. 
</P>
<P>
A band that has so many varied solo projects (nine) and cohesiveness is not to 
be subjected to a historical essay. I think that (Church lead singer) Steve 
Kilbey responded best the other evening to the charges, saying roughly, "It's 
as if we reached an impressive stature by immaculate conception!" Folk roots or 
no folk roots, the Church buried Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and the Beatles last 
night.

CONNICK IS NEW STANDARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sir, did you like or dislike Harry Connick Jr.'s concert? ("For Young Harry 
Connick, Old Times Are Good Times," by Mike Boehm, July 9). I couldn't tell, 
nor could anyone else that read it. 
</P>
<P>
I like Mr. Connick's work tremendously. I think he is a breath of fresh air in 
a stagnant era of music. If it takes someone to breathe new life into old songs 
to get the music world going, then I think that is wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
I must protest a comment of yours. "When it comes to the standards, Tony 
Bennett at 63 and Sinatra at 74 are better bets today, than Connick is ever 
likely to be." That's the biggest load of stuff I have read in a long time. 
Have you listened to either of those "gentlemen" lately? Comparing a 
22-year-old man, just starting out, to two aging Lotharios, is a complete joke. 
I loved Sinatra in his early years, and as for Mr. Bennett, well I won't get 
into that, but Harry Connick Jr. is someone I look forward to hearing and 
seeing more of. His stylings are unique, his stage manners zestful and I have 
fallen in love with the standards again. Now I don't have to hit the oldies 
section of the record store, I can look forward to hearing them done over, by 
someone with loads of talent.

RENZO PIANO WAS DONE IN BY NARROW-MINDED NEWPORT SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Leon Whiteson's story on the ousting of Renzo Piano's architectural plan for 
Newport Harbor Art Museum ("Why Newport Cast Off Its Architect," July 21). Oh, 
how this story so often repeats itself! Money, influence, power and deceit 
often gang up on the "creative" individuals in our society. 
</P>
<P>
(Museum board member Donald) Bren's dishonesty with an "alternative plan" 
without knowledge of Piano makes one feel compassion for Joan Irvine Smith 
(after the fact) in their dealings. Piano is lucky to escape with his fine 
sense of professionalism, which seems to escape the rich and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
And I'm sure they don't really understand his philosophical views in the 
slightest. 
</P>
<P>
Newport people (a dangerous generalization to be sure) are a special, strange 
breed. But these affluent narrow-visioned types summed up my general 
impressions of how they deal with all events -- business or social. Speaking of 
social events. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One New Year's Eve, eight of us booked the Ritz in Newport for a gala evening. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:50 the Newporters blew up their balloons, put on their hats, sent their 
streamers sailing across the room and by the stroke of midnight they were gone. 
</P>
<P>
It was "beddy" time. They did their duty by showing up for "din-din," 
celebrated as expected and left we eight diners wondering why we bothered to 
join them. Newporter mentality -- ugh.

FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP IS NIPPING AT NETWORKS' HEELS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE RULES OF THE NETWORK GAME ARE BEING CHANGED BY THE EMERGING 
"FOURTH NETWORK." NBC, ABC AND CBS SEE PROBLEMS OVER PROGRAMMING, RATINGS, 
ADVERTISING, SYNDICATION. 
</P>

<P>
The thought of the fox in the hen house makes scary images. And it can serve as 
a giant metaphor for the Fox network and what it's doing to the other three 
broadcast systems that were there first. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at ABC, CBS and NBC may not be as much scared as they are muddled 
over the voracious little Fox, which is undertaking 10 new series in the autumn 
and expanding its programming to five nights on its way to a full week. This 
was apparent during a series of sessions over the past two weeks with national 
TV reporters in their summer visit to Los Angeles for briefings on the fall 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Fox is changing the rules of the network game, in terms of program content, 
ratings competition, advertising dollars and even the future of the syndication 
business, that land where the bigger bucks live. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major battles of the fall, for example, is 8 p.m. Thursdays, 
currently in the possession of Bill Cosby and NBC. Fox has decided to pit its 
hottest series, "The Simpsons," against "The Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
The implications are vast. For one, the networks now may be forced to make 
quicker decisions on marginal shows, what with this new hot breath on their 
backsides. Bob Iger, the chief programmer at ABC, related that on a couple of 
occasions last season, ABC finished a hitherto-unknown fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a cold shower in the morning, boy! 
</P>
<P>
"Make that call to New York (for the previous night's ratings) and you realize 
that you hear three names mentioned and you're not on the list! 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, you're fourth (in that time slot) -- you know, taking up the 
rear. ABC in fourth place. Shock." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Fox, with spicy counter-programming such as "Married . . . With 
Children," has stirred controversies about the changing tastes of television. 
With "Married" climbing into the upper echelons of the ratings, the other 
broadcasters may be sensing that they likewise may need some racy programming 
to defend against this intrusion in their domain. 
</P>
<P>
It has gotten dicey, especially when Brandon Tartikoff, NBC's master programmer 
and one of the fiercer competitors in town, grumbled that Fox was pandering to 
"the worst aspects of the American television audience." Not only did the 
comment raise anew the debate about dissolving tastes on TV -- that anxiety 
never seems to go away -- but it also constituted a breach of the usual 
respectful manner in which Hollywood executives deal with one another, at least 
in public. 
</P>
<P>
Fox executives dodged the shots in their meeting with reporters. Peter Chernin, 
president of Fox Entertainment Group, was asked for his response and said that 
he didn't have any except that "I don't think that he (Tartikoff) meant it." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Sagansky, president of CBS Entertainment, under fire for matters of 
questionable taste in some of his new programs, was asked his thoughts about 
Fox: "My only opinion is that I wish I had a few of those (shows). I'd take 
'The Simpsons' and you probably wouldn't have to twist my arm too much to take 
'Married . . . With Children.' " 
</P>
<P>
During NBC interviews, taste also raised its head with Robert C. Wright, 
president and chief executive officer of NBC. A reporter reminded him of a 
similar meeting with writers a few years ago regarding "sensationalistic 
content" of NBC shows, specifically Geraldo Rivera's notorious special on 
satanism. At that time, Wright referred to "a double standard," saying that 
people rent R-rated movies or watch them on cable but have a different 
expectation for the broadcast networks. 
</P>
<P>
The new question: Isn't Fox getting away with "a lot of things that you (NBC) 
might have trouble with?" 
</P>
<P>
Wright agreed but said that the different standard is with local stations. "The 
images that have been carefully created and developed over 30-40 years at the 
NBC-affiliated station level are vastly different from the images that have 
been created at the Fox local-station level," he said. People have "different 
expectations" of the stations affiliated with the reigning networks than they 
do of the Fox stations, which tend to be much newer independents. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't do news, by and large," Wright went on. "They don't have a lot of 
community service or public affairs. And their image in the community is kind 
of flashy entertainment to begin with. So they're not a bad fit for that issue. 
Not for us, though." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Burke, president and chief executive officer of Capital Cities/ABC, saw 
serious financial problems posed by "Fox's emergence" because of most of its 
affiliates are the top-rated independent in their respective market. 
</P>
<P>
"And as they fill up more of that independent's broadcast schedule, that leaves 
a less buoyant market for off-network syndicated programming," he said, 
referring to shows that aired initially on the networks and then are sold to 
local stations for reruns. "And as network programming costs rise and there's 
less and less hope of substantial return in the syndicated market, it can 
ultimately make a significant contribution to economic problems for everybody 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
That is, TV producers typically don't cover their production costs with the 
"license fee" paid by a network and count on syndication to push them into 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
So what Burke was saying was that Fox may be taking its bite out of the bottom 
line. And that's the most painful bite of them all.

EPISCOPAL CHURCH, PRESERVATIONISTS REACH ACCORD ON SAVING BUILDING; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: DIOCESAN OFFICIALS AGREE TO MOVE THE STRUCTURE RATHER THAN 
DEMOLISH IT. THEY AREN'T HAPPY ABOUT THE COST. 
</P>

<P>
The Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles and preservationists have reached an 
uneasy compromise that will save the oldest Episcopal church in the city. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the church will be moved across the street from its present 
one-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials say the $500,000 cost of moving the building should be used 
for more worthy causes, but preservationists say the church has historic value 
as an example of the craftsman style of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Episcopal officials decided last year to demolish St. Athanasius and St. Paul, 
a small wooden sanctuary overlooking Echo Park Lake, so the site could be used 
as part of a new religious center that will include a diocesan headquarters and 
a new church. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the Los Angeles Conservancy vowed to save the 88-year-old 
edifice. 
</P>
<P>
The diocese, which oversees 151 churches in five counties, will provide the 
$8.4 million for the center and new church. Church officials hope that fund 
raisers will provide much of the $500,000 cost of moving the present 
brown-shingled structure. 
</P>
<P>
"The building is really in bad shape," said the Rev. J. Jon Bruno, the church's 
pastor, bouncing on the floor to demonstrate that termites had weakened the 
sloping foundation. "It was hard, thinking about demolishing it. But the 
reality is that half a million dollars is a lot of money for what is 
essentially a poor church." 
</P>
<P>
St. Athanasius and St. Paul is a bilingual congregation of 297 members that 
serves a low-income neighborhood. The church has an annual budget of about 
$100,000, 40% of which is used for such social services as providing groceries 
for 400 to 600 families a month, drug, alcohol and AIDS counseling, and gang 
intervention, Bruno said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really care about this community," said Bruno, 44, who was born in Echo 
Park. "I don't want the services we provide to be inhibited because we are 
sinking money into moving this building. If preservation means that one family 
goes hungry, or one kid ends up in a gang, then it's not worth it to me." 
</P>
<P>
The preservationists aren't totally happy, either. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Rounds, executive director of the nonprofit Los Angeles Conservancy, said 
that moving the sanctuary means "sacrificing the high value we put on 
preserving buildings in their original context." 
</P>
<P>
"The church is a rare representative of the craftsman style," he said about the 
rudimentary architectural design that features simple lines and exposed beams. 
"This is probably one of the only (non-residential) examples left in the city, 
and clearly it is the premiere example." 
</P>
<P>
After the church is moved, it will be used for meetings and to house 
denomination archives, rather than for religious services. 
</P>
<P>
It was founded as St. Athanasius in 1865 by the Rev. Elais Birdsall, the first 
Episcopal missionary to come West after the Civil War. He originally installed 
his congregation in a brick building at Temple and New High streets. 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, the congregation was forced to move and decided to 
construct a new building. Some members of the congregation, upset over the 
difficulty of pronouncing St. Athanasius (Ath-a-nay-shes), changed the name to 
St. Paul. Other members, angry over the switch, left the church, formed a new 
congregation and kept the old name. The congregations were separate for about 
80 years before reuniting in 1986. Thus the double name St. Athanasius and St. 
Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Although conservancy researchers were unable to find a building permit for the 
original St. Athanasius, diocese records show that it probably was completed in 
1902 and was on Custer Avenue near City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
In 1920, when the building was moved to its current site at 840 Echo Park 
Blvd., it had clapboard siding. The main entrance was on the north side of the 
building, and it had no porch. It was slightly smaller than it is now and 
contained only a few stained-glass windows. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the entrance is on the west side of the building, facing Echo Park Lake, 
and almost all of the windows are made from stained glass, including some that 
were installed in the 1950s and 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been moved and changed so many times that there is some question about 
the quality of the site," said Thomas Holland, project director for the new 
diocesan center. "It's not the same building it was at the turn of the 
century." 
</P>
<P>
But preservationists say remodeling doesn't deter from its importance. "The 
White House has been remodeled many times, and I don't think anyone would 
question its historical significance," Rounds said. "It's not like an 
aluminum-siding salesman made changes to it last week." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Rounds said, noted Los Angeles architect Arthur B. Benton is believed 
to be responsible for remodeling the church after it was moved to its current 
site. Benton, a member of the parish, was one of the architects for the Mission 
Inn in Riverside and designed the Los Angeles YMCA Residents' Building and the 
San Gabriel Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Gloria Molina stepped in to help orchestrate the compromise. 
"We tried to see what we could do to preserve the building and still meet the 
needs of the diocese," said Steve Jimenez, a legislative aide to Molina, whose 
district includes the church and who sits on the council committee that hears 
cases recommended for historical monument status. "We wanted to balance both 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
Diocesan officials, currently based in an office downtown, picked Echo Park for 
their new home because they want to stay in the heart of the city, and 
particularly in a neighborhood where one of its churches already has a 
considerable presence. 
</P>
<P>
The new center will include administrative buildings, an assembly hall, 
conference rooms, a bookstore, overnight accommodations for retreats, two 
parking lots and the new St. Athanasius and St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, said Bishop Frederick Borsch, the compromise with the conservancy 
was the only way to make the new center a reality. "It would have been a 
difficult fight that we may or may not have won," said Borsch, the leader of 
the 80,000-member diocese. "We have never had a center, and we were quite 
excited about this project. We'd like to get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Holland: "We started from the position that we wanted to demolish the 
church. But after the other parties made their position known, it seemed better 
to make the compromise. I guess you could say we're making the best of it."

JEWISH COMMUNITY RALLIES FOR EMIGRES; 
</P>
<P>
FUND RAISING: OPERATION EXODUS HOPES TO EASE TRANSITION FROM SOVIET UNION TO 
ISRAEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Operation Exodus, the worldwide project to resettle Soviet Jews emigrating to 
Israel, is catching the imagination -- and reaching the wallets -- of the 
Southern California Jewish community, according to leaders of the mammoth fund 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
The halfway mark for the Los Angeles County goal of $36 million has already 
been reached, with several more months to go in the campaign, said Ron Rieder 
of the Jewish Federation-Council, coordinating body for the Los Angeles effort. 
Meanwhile, more than $400,000 of Orange County's goal of $1.2 million has been 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
The total goal is $420 million from the United States and $600 million 
worldwide. The money is to be channeled over the next three years through the 
Jewish Agency, a body operating in Israel under an international board. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the first time in the diverse history of the Los Angeles 
Jewish community that nearly all the organizations in town have come together 
as one to support something," Rieder said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to food and housing, Operation Exodus provides scholarships for 
Soviet Jews to train for new jobs in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Soviet Union liberalized its emigration policies in the spring of 
1989, more than 50,000 Soviet Jews have flooded into Israel. Another 15,000 to 
25,000 are expected to arrive this month alone. Operation Exodus leaders 
predict the total may reach 100,000 by year's end and 500,000 within several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Area synagogues are finding creative ways to raise money for the project. 
</P>
<P>
At Pasadena's Conservative Jewish Temple and Center, fund leaders Bob and Renee 
Oran are emphasizing "saving 50 lives." That translates to a $225,000 goal 
because the estimated cost of bringing a family of four from Moscow to Israel 
and providing for their needs for the first year is $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Marvin Sugarman of Shaarey Zedek, a North Hollywood Orthodox 
congregation, has asked every member family to pledge $1,000 or "$1 a day for 
three years." 
</P>
<P>
And at Shaarei Tefila Orthodox congregation in West Los Angeles, the parents of 
a bride and groom who were recently married there gave $10,000 to Operation 
Exodus and cut down on the expenses of the wedding celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Rabbi Allan Shranz of Westwood's Sinai Temple called his 
congregation's response "overwhelming," and Reform Rabbi Harvey J. Fields of 
Wilshire Boulevard Temple said the campaign "has reached the gut of Jews in a 
very powerful way." 
</P>
<P>
It has evoked memories of Jews desperately seeking to get out of Europe during 
World War II, Fields said. "Today Jews are leaving the Soviet Union in fear of 
the rising tide of anti-Semitism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chelle Friedman, public relations director for the Jewish Federation of Orange 
County, said their "big push" for Operation Exodus will come during the high 
holidays of mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
"Congregations will work to raise $500,000 in cash to charter a freedom flight 
-- a plane to take Jews from Hungary, where they have been stranded, to 
Israel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shear Yashuv Cohen, the chief rabbi of Haifa, Israel, sees the work of 
Operation Exodus from a unique vantage point. The founder of Ariel, a group of 
Torah institutions in Israel, Cohen helps resettled Soviet Jews become 
"Jewishly connected." 
</P>
<P>
Ariel, not funded through Operation Exodus, is training 15 Russian rabbis in 
Jerusalem who "know the language and the mentality" of Soviet Jews, Cohen said 
during a recent Los Angeles visit. 
</P>
<P>
The emigrants "need to be accepted into the Jewish covenant. . . . They know 
they are Jewish, but they need help to be amalgamated back into their ancient 
religion after all these years," Cohen added. 
</P>
<P>
"An historic moment of Jewish history knocks at our door," he said. "Many 
generations have prayed for this moment, and now we have been privileged to 
live it." 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of American Jews are of Russian or East European origin, and 20% of 
Southern California's estimated 600,000 Jews have an affiliation with a 
synagogue or Jewish organization.

COURT TO RULE ON SPIRITUAL HEALING DEATHS

<P>
A panel of the Minnesota Court of Appeals has been asked to decide whether 
Christian Science parents can face criminal penalties if their children die 
after receiving only spiritual healing treatment for serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
The panel heard arguments July 11 in St. Paul on an appeal by Hennepin County 
of an April ruling by Hennepin County Judge Eugene Farrell that dismissed 
second-degree manslaughter charges against a Christian Science couple in the 
death of Ian Douglass Lundman. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old boy's mother and stepfather, Kathleen and William McKown, were 
indicted after he died of insulin deficiency May 9, 1989, in the couple's 
Independence, Minn., home. Before his death, the boy had been sick with 
flu-like symptoms for three days. The government claimed that by relying only 
on prayer to cure the boy's illness, the couple had negligently caused his 
death by creating an unreasonable risk. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell dismissed the charges on grounds that parents who rely on spiritual 
healing for their children's health care can't be punished for criminal child 
neglect when that care is less than successful. 
</P>
<P>
Hennepin County Atty. Tom Johnson told the appeals panel that while the 
parents' religious beliefs have absolute protection under the law, their 
actions do not.

CONFIDENCE IN S&amp;LS DOWN SHARPLY, POLL FINDS

The American public's confidence in the savings and loan industry has eroded 
sharply in recent months, and while only a handful say they have been directly 
affected by the S&amp;L crisis, most believe that higher taxes are inevitable 
to pay for the industry's cleanup, according to a Washington Post-ABC News 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
Only 27% of those interviewed said they had a great deal or a good amount of 
confidence in the savings and loan industry -- down from 44% in March, 1989. At 
the same time, those expressing little or no confidence in the industry 
increased from 56% to 72%. 
</P>
<P>
To measure public attitudes toward the savings and loan crisis, the Post and 
ABC questioned 1,509 randomly selected adults between July 19 and 24. Margin of 
sampling error for the overall results is plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
The public voiced more concern than in the earlier poll about the ability of 
the federal insurance system, which insures deposits to $100,000, to pay people 
who lost their savings when their thrift fails. 
</P>
<P>
Only 47% said they were confident that the government would have the money to 
cover depositors' losses, compared to 63% in a poll done in March, 1989. And 
52% of those recently questioned expressed little faith that depositors would 
get their money back, up from 35% in the March survey. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is the public confident that the government will bring to justice S&amp;L 
executives whose fraudulent business practices contributed to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the involvement of Neil Bush, the President's son, 
in a failed Denver savings and loan has not significantly tarnished the Bush 
Administration at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly nine out of 10 predicted that the government will fail to win 
convictions on most of the few cases that are brought to trial. And 58% said 
"hardly any" of those convicted will go to jail, even though more than nine out 
of 10 said savings and loan executives found guilty of fraud should spend time 
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Eight out of 10 people questioned said the mounting cost of the bailout will 
require a tax increase -- a prospect that seven out of 10 acknowledged bothered 
them "a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The depth of the public's anger suggests rough times ahead for President Bush 
and congressional incumbents, though the political implications of the scandal 
are anything but clear. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than half -- 45% -- said Bush is doing all he can to solve the savings 
and loan crisis, and 58% expressed disapproval about the way his Administration 
has handled the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The public is even more critical of Congress. Six out of 10 said Congress 
wasn't doing as much as it should. Two out of three said the savings and loan 
industry wasn't doing as much as it could.

MCDONNELL'S DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S AND S&amp;P 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KRENSAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a widely expected move, Wall Street Friday downgraded the ratings of 
McDonnell Douglas debt, citing the beleaguered aerospace firm's deteriorating 
financial position. 
</P>
<P>
The downgrading, by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's 
Corp., will affect about $3 billion in long-term debt and increase interest 
expenses on an additional $1 billion the company is expected to borrow by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The lower ratings reflect cost overruns on McDonnell's A-12 and T-45 military 
aircraft programs, hefty cash requirements for its MD-11 airliner and an 
overall decline in military spending, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The downgrading comes despite an announced $700-million cost-cutting program, a 
drastic measure to improve profitability of the ailing St. Louis company. The 
program will eliminate up to 17,000 jobs this year, including 9,000 in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen the company's balance sheet weakening and we have seen certain 
liquidity pressures," said Tassos Philippakos, aerospace analyst for Moody's. 
"It is possible that the company's balance sheet will weaken even further, at 
least in the near term." 
</P>
<P>
Moody's lowered McDonnell's senior debt rating to Baa3 from Baa1 and that on 
subordinated debt to Ba2 from Baa2. The service also downgraded McDonnell's 
commercial paper and shelf registration ratings. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Moody's lowered the debt ratings of McDonnell Douglas Finance Co., 
a financial subsidiary with $2.5 billion of debt. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P announced similar downgradings, decreasing McDonnell's senior debt to 
BBB-plus from single-A-minus, its subordinated debt to BBB from BBB-plus and 
shelf-registered debt to BBB-plus from A-minus. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P did not downgrade McDonnell Douglas Finance Co.'s senior and 
subordinated debt, but held them on its watch list. 
</P>
<P>
All of McDonnell's debt is still considered investment grade, although the Baa3 
ranking that Moody's gave the corporation's senior debt is just above its 
"speculative" grades. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the downgradings, the ratings services cited potential cost 
overruns on McDonnell's A-12 attack jet and T-45 trainer programs. McDonnell 
disclosed this month that it would not take a charge against second-quarter 
earnings for its highly classified A-12 program for the U.S. Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, McDonnell will ask the Navy to cover cost overruns on the fixed-price 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe there is a good possibility, although management has decided it 
would not take writeoffs, eventually, it may have to," Philippakos said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, McDonnell's Douglas Aircraft unit faces a short-term cash drain in 
connection with its MD-11 airliner. Citing inefficiencies, technical problems 
and delays, analysts estimate that Douglas will lose $100 million in 1990, 
following a $222-million loss in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Although orders for 157 MD-11's eventually will brighten McDonnell's cash 
position, development costs could strain the company until the new aircraft 
wins Federal Aviation Administration approval, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The company is pushing for an Oct. 31 approval, a goal that could prove 
ambitious, said Lawrence M. Harris, a senior analyst for the Los Angeles-based 
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards investment firm." 
</P>
<P>
Harris estimated that McDonnell needs to borrow an additional $1 billion during 
the rest of the year to finance inventory growth stemming in part from the 
MD-11 program. Friday's downgrading will mean higher interest costs on the 
borrowing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, McDonnell's debt, including that of its financial 
subsidiary, was $5.2 billion, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and the company predict little impact on the operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically like your kid getting a slightly lower grade in school," said 
Wolfgang Demisch, an aerospace analyst with UBS Securities in New York. "But 
it's not like he's going to drop out or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell spokesman Barbara Anderson, also predicting no disruption of 
operations said: "McDonnell Douglas does not feel its performance, financial 
condition or future prospects warrants these measures." 
</P>
<P>
Because McDonnell's debt has been on the ratings services' watch lists since 
June, Friday's announcements drew little surprise from Wall Street. McDonnell 
stock closed at $42.75 a share Friday, up 12 1/2 cents.

STAR DRUG PROZAC BECOMES LILLY LIABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS and LINDA DARNELL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prozac, a depression remedy that has been a star performer for pharmaceuticals 
giant Eli Lilly &amp; Co., has turned into a sudden liability in the wake of 
recent lawsuits targeting the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Though Indianapolis-based Lilly defends the safety of Prozac, noting that more 
than 2 million people have taken the prescription drug, analysts worry about 
the effect of negative news on a drug that is becoming increasingly important 
to Lilly. 
</P>
<P>
Two suits filed in the last two weeks blame Prozac for inducing violent 
thoughts in a New York woman, who slashed herself hundreds of times, and in a 
Kentucky man, who shot and killed seven people and wounded 13 others before 
killing himself at a printing plant in Louisville last year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Lilly, whose sales and earnings have been rising partly on the 
strength of Prozac, has been taking a beating on Wall Street. The stock dropped 
$4.375 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Before the suits hit the headlines, Lilly's stock had been moving up. It closed 
at $88.50 on July 16, the day before the first suit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly's shares inched up 87.5 cents in heavy trading Friday to close at $80.50 
on the New York Stock Exchange, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 
22.28 points. Slightly more than 1.9 million shares traded, making Lilly the 
seventh most actively traded stock on the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"I view the lawsuits themselves as a non-event. . . . There really is no 
scientific basis for the complaint. People who are depressed are suicidal 
anyway," said Rita Freedman, an analyst with Provident National Bank in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, the issue of concern to Lilly is the possibility of 
additional lawsuits and more "negative publicity" about a drug that is very 
important to the company financially. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman estimated that sales from the drug have already reached about $385 
million this year, compared to about $350 million for all of last year. 
Analysts expect Prozac sales to top $650 million this year and to hit $1 
billion in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed nail-biting time (for Lilly) because you just don't know what 
eventually will happen" in the political arena and before a jury, said Viren 
Mehta, partner in Mehta &amp; Isaly, a New York-based pharmaceutical research 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the moment there is no reason to believe that there is anything wrong 
with the way Prozac works or the way Eli Lilly has marketed Prozac," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Richard R. Stover, an analyst with the Alex. Brown &amp; Sons brokerage 
firm, "There definitely is a concern that patients who can truly benefit from 
the drug could be scared away from continuing to use it, or some physicians may 
be scared away from prescribing it." 
</P>
<P>
A Lilly spokesman could not be reached for comment Friday, but the company said 
in a statement that the murderer in the Kentucky case, Joseph Wesbecker, "had a 
lengthy history of psychiatric disturbance, including suicide attempts and 
homicidal threats prior to taking Prozac. It would not appear that Prozac 
caused this behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Since it was introduced in December, 1987, sales of Prozac have soared because 
it has fewer side effects than drugs previously available. It was the subject 
of favorable cover stories in Newsweek and New York magazines, and the National 
Enquirer called it a "wonder drug." 
</P>
<P>
But there have been complaints, most notably in an article last February in the 
American Journal of Psychiatry. Author Martin Teicher, a research psychiatrist 
at Harvard University, discussed six patients who developed intense and violent 
thoughts of suicide while taking Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
The Church of Scientology, through its affiliate, the Citizens Commission on 
Human Rights, on Wednesday sent a letter to Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee, calling for an investigation of Prozac and 
a recall of the drug. Scientology, whose members often wear shirts reading 
"Psychiatry Kills," has long campaigned against psychiatric drugs. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Dingell said the committee is not investigating Prozac.

BUYER OF COLUMBIA JUNK DEBT INCLUDES ASIAN HEAVYWEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting quickly to address doubts about its financial wherewithal, the 
investment group planning to buy Columbia Savings &amp; Loan's troubled junk 
bond portfolio for $3 billion said Friday that it is half-owned by Hong Kong 
billionaire Li Ka-shing. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure that one of the world's wealthiest individuals is involved in 
the proposed deal comes amid concerns that the transaction still carries risk 
for Columbia and taxpayers should the Gordon America partnership default on a 
loan it plans to use to finance the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
As announced Wednesday, the Canadian-led investment group will make a 
$300-million down payment to Columbia, with the troubled Beverly Hills thrift 
financing the rest by carrying a $2.7-billion, 10-year note with a 10.5% annual 
interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns have been raised by some observers and members of Congress that 
Columbia, and ultimately taxpayers, still won't be shedding their risk because 
Gordon could default on the note. If that happened, they argue, Gordon would 
walk away from the deal, sticking Columbia with the junk bonds and huge 
potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia bought the bonds with taxpayer-insured deposits in the 1980s. The 
interest payments initially produced huge profits, but the junk bond market 
collapse caused nearly $1 billion in losses. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas I. A. Allen, a member of the Gordon group, said in an interview that 
disclosure of Li's involvement through three companies he controls was made 
partly to reassure regulators and Congress that the group is solid financially. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to know who we are. We are saying we are responsible people with 
good backing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A former toy salesman, Li, 62, controls a net worth of more than $1.2 billion, 
according to Forbes magazine. One source close to the deal said Li did not want 
to disclose his interest but felt it was necessary. Allen, however, said that 
Li may have had to disclose it anyway because he controls publicly held 
companies in Hong Kong. Li's trading firm, Hutchison Whampoa, and a real estate 
firm, Cheung Kong, will each hold 20% of Gordon America, with 10% held by a 
private company of Li's. Li will also put up $150 million of the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Li's representatives could not be reached for comment, but in a newspaper 
interview last year he said he was seeking to further diversify his investments 
beyond Hong Kong, where 90% of his assets are based. China will take control of 
Hong Kong in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon America was formed by Gordon Investment Corp. Hutchison Whampoa is a 
small investor in Gordon Investment with a stake believed to be less than 5%. 
The largest institutional shareholder is Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce 
with a 26% stake, according to sources familiar with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said Gordon needed Li's added investment to make the purchase work. 
Because of the large size of the portfolio relative to Gordon's capital, the 
deal entails high risk. 
</P>
<P>
Allen downplayed the risk Gordon will default, arguing that it is a 
well-financed group that wants to hold the bonds for years. He said the 
alternative to selling the bonds to Gordon is for thrift regulators to seize 
Columbia, which is insolvent, and add the bonds to the federal government's 
nearly $4-billion portfolio. If it did that, he said, it would give up Gordon's 
$300-million down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Allen added that any future declines in the bonds' value will have little 
effect on Gordon's investment strategy because it doesn't plan to trade them. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the group realized that the sale could run into resistance from 
regulators or Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone called me the other day to congratulate me and said 'You got the 
girl,' " Allen said. "I said, 'All we got was the right to speak to her 
father.' "

Snag in PTL Buyout Bid: A Jewish-born evangelist's $52-million bid to buy Jim 
Bakker's PTL ministry and its opulent Christian retreat was in danger of 
collapse as creditors dragged their heels on finalizing the sale. "We are very 
hopeful that the trustee and the creditors can quickly come to a resolution," 
said would-be buyer Morris Cerullo, whose World Evangelism ministry is based in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"However, we made it clear that we cannot stay in this deal much longer," he 
added. Cerullo, 58, was in Atlanta en route to Fort Mill, S.C., to take 
possession of PTL, when he learned that even though the ministry's secured 
creditors had approved the sale, they were dickering over language in the sale 
contract.

Pickens Challenges Toyota: Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens, who has been shut out 
of a Japanese auto-parts firm's decision-making process despite being its 
largest stockholder, said he is switching tactics and will wage his fight 
against Toyota Motor Corp., which he said is the smaller company's real master. 
"I don't think anybody is going to argue with me that Toyota is controlling 
Koito (Manufacturing Co., the auto-parts maker)," Pickens said in a telephone 
interview from his office in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"We might as well go to the top of the organization." Toyota, Japan's largest 
auto maker, owns 19% of Koito, the country's largest auto-parts manufacturer. 
Pickens owns 26%, the largest of any single shareholder, but has been denied a 
seat on the board. Toyota refused to comment on Pickens' latest charges.

Swiss Probe Philip Morris Deal: Swiss authorities have launched a formal probe 
of possible insider trading in Jacobs Suchard AG shares before the Swiss 
chocolate and coffee group agreed last month to be bought by U.S. tobacco and 
food giant Philip Morris for $3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come across some aspects during our informal inquiries that could 
indicate insider trading," prosecutor Daniel Tewlin said. "We now want to get 
some information that we could not get through informal inquiries." By starting 
a formal investigation, Tewlin is empowered to seize documents he thinks are 
pertinent to the case. Insider trading has been illegal in Switzerland since 
1988, but no one has ever been prosecuted.

SCRIPPS CLINIC, MEMORIAL HOSPITALS TO MERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After a whirlwind courtship, Scripps Memorial Hospitals and Scripps Clinic 
&amp; Research Foundation have agreed to unify next Jan. 1, leaving Sharp 
HealthCare as the jilted party in a health-care triangle. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise union announced Friday would create the largest health-care 
concern in San Diego County, an $820-million-a-year conglomerate that would be 
the county's No. 2 non-governmental employer. 
</P>
<P>
It also effectively scuttles Scripps Clinic-Sharp HealthCare merger talks that 
had been going on for a year. There had been reports in the health-care 
community over the last month that those talks had broken down. 
</P>
<P>
A Sharp spokeswoman tersely said Friday that Sharp was surprised by the move. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't participate in the (Scripps-Scripps) deliberations, nor were we 
advised of them. We had continued our discussions with the clinic regarding 
development of joint clinical programs literally until today," said Cindy 
Cohagen. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had no comment on the future of the joint organ transplant program 
that Sharp and Scripps Clinic inaugurated last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was publicity in early June about the potential Scripps 
Clinic-Sharp merger that helped bring about the subsequent talks between the 
two Scripps facilities. 
</P>
<P>
After reading in the newspaper about the Sharp merger talks, trustees of the 
two Scrippses began talking informally later in June, said Ames S. Early, 
president of Scripps Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions quickly snowballed. Over the last two weeks, administrators 
entered the talks and the agreement was forged, Early said. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions moved so quickly, he added, because Scripps Memorial and Scripps 
Clinic share a common corporate culture from their roots in the philanthropy of 
Ellen Browning Scripps. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper heiress established both the hospital and the research foundation 
jointly in 1924 but they split in 1946.

WESTERN DIGITAL PROFIT OFF 29% DESPITE $1-BILLION YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Irvine-based Western Digital Corp. reported Friday that its net income dropped 
29% to $24.2 million for its fiscal year ended June 30, despite a strong fourth 
quarter and annual sales that topped $1 billion for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate announcement, the company said Kathryn A. Braun, 39, who has 
headed its storage businesses since 1981, has been promoted to a newly created 
No. 2 executive post. As executive vice president, Braun will be responsible 
for overseeing all manufacturing operations, marketing and research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
One Wall Street analyst and a company insider said Braun is considered a likely 
successor to Roger W. Johnson, the company's 56-year-old chairman, president 
and chief executive. But other analysts said the line of succession is unclear 
and that Johnson's retirement is not expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said in an interview that the company created Braun's position to 
improve cooperation between divisions as part of a program to better coordinate 
product design and manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
"In our businesses, the strategy is in place, and it's a function of how well 
we execute," Johnson said. "Kathy Braun has demonstrated excellent operations 
expertise." 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital also disclosed that it signed a key product development 
agreement with International Business Machines Corp. during the fourth quarter. 
Johnson said the company also expects to negotiate another manufacturing 
agreement with IBM during the current quarter that would "further strengthen" 
the company's relationship with IBM. He declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also declined to comment on persistent rumors that Western Digital will 
produce a notebook-sized computer for IBM. Wall Street analysts said they 
believe that Western Digital will make the computer, but they cautioned that it 
should not be considered a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital's sales for the fiscal year were $1.07 billion, up 8% from 
$992.1 million a year earlier. Analysts said earnings for the fiscal year were 
depressed by a $2.7-million loss in the first quarter, when the company was 
still recovering from a downturn in early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, the company earned $9.5 million, up 120% from $4.3 
million a year earlier. Revenue rose 20.6% to $293.9 million from $243.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence W. Borgman, an analyst for Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc. in New York, 
said Western Digital's fourth-quarter results exceeded expectations. "They are 
moving higher along the technology curve, with new generations of products 
coming out, especially in the disk-drive business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the result for the latest quarter "reflects the underlying 
strengths of our products and the strategies that we have been pursuing over 
the past two years." 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital's strategy has been to become a kind of one-stop shopping 
center for PC manufacturers by supplying a wide variety of components. Western 
Digital stock closed unchanged Friday at $12.375 per share in trading on the 
American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it has received a $38-million order to supply 3.5-inch 
"intelligent" disk drives to a U.S. computer manufacturer over the next six 
months. The company declined to identify the customer.

FANS, NOT ALBUMS, CARVE NICHE FOR DEPECHE MODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the years, Depeche Mode has probably broken more attendance records than 
it has sold records. 
</P>
<P>
The British synth-pop band has become this year's biggest concert attraction in 
the country, even though until recently they've never had much success on the 
U.S. charts -- which generally is what precipitates huge live draws. 
</P>
<P>
For Depeche Mode, the trend isn't new. Two years ago, the band easily sold out 
the 75,000-capacity Rose Bowl in Pasadena. At the time, it had only one Top 40 
hit to its credit, "People Are People," which had peaked at No. 13 on 
Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart in July, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
This month, Depeche Mode becomes only the second pop act in San Diego Sports 
Arena history to play three nights at the 12,000-seat venue. Neil Diamond did 
three shows in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
By the time "Violator" and "Enjoy the Silence" recently 
</P>
<P>
became the group's first-ever Top 10 album and single, respectively, the first 
two shows -- tonight and 
</P>
<P>
Sunday -- had already sold out, prompting the addition of a third date Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Depeche Mode plays simple, innocuous dance music with an infectious, though not 
overpowering, synthesized beat. The band's rhythms and melodies are as stark 
and brooding as the lyrics, which address such topics as love and growing pains 
from the standpoint of teen angst. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the band's initial live appeal was its fashionable look and image. The 
name Depeche Mode is French for "up-to-the-minute fashion" -- and, although the 
four members have since grown out of their frilly "New Romantic" stage, their 
live shows are as opulent as ever. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a ticket gets you nearly three hours of throbbing, nonstop dance 
music, with plenty of smoke machines, flashing lights, dancing and special 
effects -- including bits of movies projected onto a pair of wide screens 
flanking the stage. It's sort of like being in the world's biggest, splashiest 
disco, only the action takes place on stage rather than on the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
Depeche Mode's unusual rise from box-office star to chart sensation is not 
unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at U2 and, to a degree, INXS, the same thing happened," veteran 
San Diego concert promoter Bill Silva said. He is producing the three Depeche 
Mode shows at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"They became superstars on the basis of their live shows; they made their 
concerts such incredible experiences that their fans would run home, grab a 
couple of friends, and say, 'You've got to see their next show with me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Since the group's emergence from the London pub scene in 1981, when they signed 
with a tiny independent U.K. label, its concerts have been as studio-perfect as 
their records -- thanks to the truckload of computers, drum machines, samplers, 
sequencers and other high-tech accouterments hauled up on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest mistakes we've ever made was when we first booked them into 
the Sports Arena in 1984," Silva said. "Their agency wanted us to go with the 
whole arena, and we thought they were crazy -- so we convinced them to do the 
amphitheater configuration, with only 5,200 seats. 
</P>
<P>
"When we all but sold out the first hour, we belatedly realized that we could 
have sold a lot more, that we had really underestimated their draw. 
</P>
<P>
"I still remember when the band arrived at the arena -- they were looking 
around the place, cut down as it was, and looking at us like, 'Didn't you 
believe in us?' " 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Silva said, he brought Depeche Mode back to the Sports Arena 
-- this time to the full arena -- and the show quickly sold out. So did the 
band's full-arena encore in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"So this year, when we decided to bring them back a third time, we were the 
ones who were pushing for more," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them we wanted three nights, but they wanted to be conservative and do 
only two. Only after those two shows had sold out did they agree to do a third 
show, and, even then, it took a lot of pushing and cajoling." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets to Tuesday's concert went on sale last Saturday at 10 a.m., and by the 
time the box office closed for the day, 5,700 tickets -- almost half -- had 
already sold. 
</P>
<P>
"Since then, we've been averaging about 400 tickets per day," Silva said.

S.D. BORDER ART LEAVES FOLKS IN OHIO UNMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN ALEXANDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LANCASTER, Ohio 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The blend of art and politics is big in San Diego. But, when a group of 
well-known San Diego artists were invited to show their art here recently, 
gallery patrons in this small Ohio town of about 35,000 people greeted the 
works with curiosity and puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the works by Raul Guerrero, David Avalos, Deborah Small, Louis Hock and 
the members of the San Diego-Tijuana-based Border Art Workshop have caused 
comment and even controversy in the artists' hometown, but they didn't seem to 
bother audiences here. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibited as part of this antebellum community's annual arts, crafts and music 
festival, the artists' works focus on the border between San Diego and Tijuana, 
and include both historical material on the repression of Mexican Indian 
natives and commentaries on the problems of contemporary undocumented Mexican 
immigrants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the topical issues in the work, political art from San Diego did not 
appear to speak to Middle America. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't what Marlana Keynes, the owner of the local men's clothing store, 
expected when she and MIT's David Jocelit decided to bring the "Living on the 
Border: Art and Activism in San Diego/Tijuana" to the gallery above her store. 
She feared that the show, which runs through next Saturday, would bring out 
some strong reactions from Lancaster's predominantly conservative populace. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope they view it with an open mind," Keynes said. "They don't have to 
like it." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Schnorr, a member of the Border Art Workshop whose "The Conversion of 
Columbus" is the centerpiece of the installation, said he hoped people here 
would apply the messages in the art to their own 
</P>
<P>
lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people in Ohio may not address the larger question we deal with in 
terms of international relations, but I think it begins with interpersonal 
relations anyway," Schnorr said in a telephone interview from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody looking at it, if they give themselves the time, is going to come away 
thinking more about their own reality than they did when they walked in. Or at 
least have two or three more questions about the Mexican-American border." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Small's "California Mission Daze," for example, is a mosaic of images 
and text that attempts to debunk the image of the 17th-Century Spanish 
missionaries as benign civilizers. Another version of the same work is on view 
at the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art. Small said she hoped Ohioans would 
look at her work and "rethink our collective history and see it from more 
points of view, and not see American history as this triumphal line of 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
No such luck. 
</P>
<P>
Though Columbus Dispatch art critic Jacqueline Hall praised the installation 
and Keynes for daring to bring a confrontational exhibit to a small, 
middle-American town, few of the opening-night patrons thought the art had any 
relation to their own experience. 
</P>
<P>
They had no previous knowledge of the artists' works, including some that have 
received significant national attention. They had never heard of David Avalos' 
"San Diego Donkey Cart," which was removed from a public square in San Diego by 
a federal judge's order, or the two billboards by Avalos, Small, Hock and 
Elizabeth Sisco labeling San Diego as "America's Finest Tourist Plantation." 
</P>
<P>
Most viewers even appeared to be unaware of San Diego's immigration problems. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't really have anything to do with us here in Ohio," said Dan 
Harkins, a retired businessman from Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
"It is rather jarring. . . . I think of San Diego as a Navy town and an 
attractive retirement area. I don't think of the mixed culture at all." 
</P>
<P>
Avalos' "Father Serra's Next Miracle: Turning Blood Into Wine" brought the 
strongest reactions. The sculpture features a leather hand with the word bingo 
spelled across the fingertips and a pierced heart in the palm that pours blood 
through a funnel and into an empty bottle of Thunderbird wine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crime what has happened to the Indians," said Sandy Romano, a Lancaster 
housewife. "But this offends me as a Catholic and as a person. This is the sort 
of thing I would be against the NEA (National Endowment for the Arts) 
supporting." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Romano stressed that she did not think such art should be banned from 
the festival, and applauded Keynes for providing an opportunity to see 
something different. 
</P>
<P>
Those entering the darkened room containing a large installation titled "The 
Conversion of Columbus" appeared to be more fascinated with the medium than the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
The floor was covered with six tons of dirt spread between a photo mural of 
Tijuana's Colonia Libertad and a charcoal mural of the canyons to the north. 
The idea was to re-create the infamous Soccer Field on which would-be 
immigrants assemble before making a dash north. Four video monitors played 
scenes of some of the guerrilla theater staged on the field, interspersed with 
ominous shots of U.S. Border Patrol vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Regular audiences for events like this one prove that there is an interest in 
art in this small town. This annual festival is a chance for locals to import 
art and music denied them the rest of the year -- normally Lancaster audiences 
have to travel 30 miles to Columbus or elsewhere for culture. As a result, they 
turn out in large numbers to nearly all the events and exhibits in the festival 
and generally appear willing to accept subjects they might find objectionable 
in another context. 
</P>
<P>
But many appeared baffled by the messages depicted in the work here. 
</P>
<P>
There were exceptions. Bill and Marilynn Boone stayed to watch a series of 
artful videos about Mexican immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's made us aware of something we didn't know was going on," Bill said. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts you right there on the border," Marilynn said. "It's a shock that this 
happens in our country. What do these people do? Is there some help for them 
when they're here? I want to read some objective articles about the problem to 
learn about it before I decide how I feel." 
</P>
<P>
Informed that the cantaloupes and grapes on special at the neighborhood 
Kroger's store may well have been picked by people such as those they watched 
running cross the border, the Boones seemed stunned. 
</P>
<P>
But most reactions were in line with those of a Lancaster matron descending the 
stairs of the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," she sighed to a friend. "That was weird."

SOVIET SAILORS READY TO STRUT THEIR STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 50 Soviet sailors steaming toward San Diego have their sights set more on 
singing and dancing than military matters. 
</P>
<P>
The group, known as the Soviet Song and Dance troupe, will show their cultural 
wares at several public places around town during the brief visit. 
</P>
<P>
Dance buffs can catch up with the entertainers at 12:15 p.m. Wednesday at Sea 
World. At noon Thursday, they will be at Balboa Park's Spreckels Organ 
Pavilion, and at 6:30 p.m. that day they will perform at San Diego State 
University's Open Air Theatre. At noon Friday, the Soviets will return to the 
organ pavilion before giving a farewell performance at 7:30 that night at 
Tidelands Park in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe is aboard the Soviet naval ships that will be making their maiden 
visit to San Diego and the West Coast on Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The fleet of three ships will moor at the Naval Station in San Diego for a 
five-day stay. Soviet officers and enlisted personnel will engage in 
professional exchanges with the three U.S. fleets hosting the visit.

U.S. EASES STANCE ON REPATRIATING INDOCHINESE 'BOAT PEOPLE';

<P>
The Bush Administration served notice Friday that it is willing to go along 
with a proposal to make it easier for Asian governments to return Indochinese 
"boat people" to their former homes in Vietnam and Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced that the United States, for the 
first time, will accept a plan under which Vietnamese or Cambodians who have 
fled from Indochina will be sent home whenever they "do not object" to 
repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing at a meeting of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Baker 
emphasized, however, that the United States continues to oppose strongly any 
effort to return any of the boat people to Vietnam or Cambodia against their 
will. 
</P>
<P>
The easing of the U.S. position on Indochinese refugees came in response to 
intense pressure by Southeast Asian governments and by British officials 
responsible for Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, tens of thousands of Vietnamese and Cambodians have 
fled by boat to Hong Kong and to neighboring countries such as Thailand, 
Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. More than 110,000 Indochinese boat 
people are now being detained in refugee camps in these countries. 
</P>
<P>
These Asian governments and Britain have grown increasingly irritated with the 
refusal of American officials to accept the principle that the boat people 
should be sent back to Vietnam and Cambodia, even against their will. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration argues that no one should be forced to return to 
Vietnam until there are changes in Hanoi's hard-line Communist regime. Yet, 
other Asian governments charge that the United States is being hypocritical 
because American officials routinely ship home refugees who come to the United 
States from places such as Haiti, Mexico and El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, two days before Baker arrived here, the six members of ASEAN 
(Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Brunei) adopted 
a resolution condemning the United States by name for its refusal to accept 
"involuntary repatriation" of those boat people who have fled Vietnam or 
Cambodia strictly for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Friday's easing of the U.S. position will satisfy the 
Asian governments. But one senior Malaysian official said bluntly he did not 
believe Baker's concession went far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"What about those people (in refugee camps) who don't want to go anywhere?" the 
Malaysian official told reporters outside the ASEAN meeting. "It's got to be, 
'Everyone must go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Malaysia effectively abandoned the commitment made by it and other 
Asian governments to let Indochinese boat people land on their shores and to 
grant them the so-called right of first asylum. Since March, 1989, Malaysia has 
turned away more than 8,000 Vietnamese boat people and sent them back to sea. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Perhaps some boats (from Vietnam) are redirected, after they have been 
replenished," Albert S. Talala, Malaysia's ambassador to the United States, 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
In their joint statement this week, the ASEAN countries suggested that unless 
they get new help from the United States, they may all begin to follow 
Malaysia's example and start turning away the Indochinese boat people. Without 
some new solution, the ASEAN foreign ministers said, they would "take such 
actions as they deem necessary . . . to safeguard their national interests, 
including the abandonment of temporary refuge." 
</P>
<P>
Japan supported the Asian countries in their dispute with the United States 
over the Indochina refugees. Makoto Yamanaka, a spokesman for the Japanese 
Foreign Ministry, said Japan believes "that some form of involuntary 
repatriation should be worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Indochinese boat people being held in detention camps in Hong 
Kong and elsewhere in Southeast Asia have been divided into two categories: 
those who are willing to volunteer to return home and those who refuse to 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Only a small percentage -- slightly more than 3,000 of the more than 110,000 
being detained in the camps -- have volunteered to go home. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise proposal embraced by Baker on Friday first was suggested by 
British officials in Hong Kong and later was supported by the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees, Thorvald Stoltenberg. Under it, a new, third 
category would be set up for boat people who, while not actually volunteering 
to go home, do not object to being repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
One senior Bush Administration said Friday that an important factor in deciding 
which refugees fall into this category would be whether some of the boat people 
can be persuaded, without the use of force or coercion, to return to Vietnam. 
Those boat people who physically resist a return to Vietnam still would not be 
required to go home, he indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Another senior U.S. official said there might be some form of "counseling" for 
Indochina refugees in the camps to induce them to overcome their objections to 
going home. 
</P>
<P>
"If you add financial support to resettle them (back in Vietnam or Cambodia), 
there is a process that would encourage people who might not otherwise raise 
their hands to say, 'I want to go back,' " this Bush Administration official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also proposed to the Asian governments Friday that the United States and 
other countries make a new commitment to clear away all the boat people from 
the Southeast Asian refugee camps by the end of 1992, either by returning them 
to Vietnam or by resettling them in third countries. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary pointedly reminded the ASEAN foreign ministers that the United 
States has already resettled 900,000 Southeast Asian refugees inside its 
borders since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Baker said the United States 
has met its financial commitments by pledging $21 million to the U.N. High 
Commission for Refugees this year and has pledged to accept 18,500 more 
Indochinese refugees in the United States within three years. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials acknowledged that during Baker's private meetings Friday, his 
efforts to alleviate the Southeast Asian officials' anger over the Indochinese 
refugees met with quite a bit of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, some of them (Southeast Asian officials) said, 'We'll have to go back 
and think about it,' " an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach), who represents northwestern Orange 
County, said he is "apprehensive" about the shift in policy, however slight. 
Rohrabacher strongly opposes forced repatriation of boat people and is a 
co-sponsor of legislation that would cut off U.S. aid to Malaysia until the 
country ends its policy of turning away refugee boats. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that people would not be fleeing a communist dictatorship (in 
Vietnam) and then voluntarily want to return," Rohrabacher said. "If they 
risked their lives to get out, what makes anybody think they may want to go 
back." Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who is working to establish a 
regional holding center for boat people to take pressure off the Southeast 
Asian host nations, said he also has reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tilting toward forced repatriation," Dornan said of the Baker 
announcement. "I'm not supportive yet for this reason: Is there going to be a 
team there reading (the boat people) their Miranda rights, saying, 'All you 
have to do is speak up to object?' . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, Dornan said, he believes the Baker statement is a move by the Bush 
Administration to buy time with the first-asylum nations so that they "don't 
come back and say, 'You've come up with no solutions' . . . and then start to 
push everybody away."

Hassan and Salem, Libyan-born Siamese twins joined at the head, were 
successfully separated early Friday in an 11-hour operation, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old brothers were in "relatively good condition" and are expected to 
recover fully, said Dr. Wolfgang Koos, chief neurologist at Vienna's General 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital did not release the boys' surname. 
</P>
<P>
Koos said the fifth and most difficult operation on the twins severed a common 
artery that supplied blood to the brains of both and "decided life or death" 
for the boys. 
</P>
<P>
Hassan and Salem were flown to Austria shortly after birth and have spent their 
entire lives in the Vienna hospital. 
</P>
<P>
After a recovery period, each will undergo cosmetic surgery to construct a new 
section of skull, using bone, skin and hair from other parts of the body.

The environmental health division of Orange County's Health Care Agency 
performs routine unannounced inspections of the county's more than 6,000 
restaurants, markets and other food establishments. When conditions violate 
state law or applicable county and municipal codes, inspectors can issue 
notices of violation. If inspectors find during an announced recheck that 
conditions cited in the notice have not been rectified, they can effectively 
close the business by suspending its health permit. Inspectors can also issue a 
summary health permit suspension during a routine inspection if they find an 
immediate health threat. In all cases, health permits are reinstated as soon as 
the situation is rectified.

<P>
RIFT REPORTEDLY LED TO PETERS' DEPARTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rift between the Huntington Beach City School District board and Supt. Diana 
Peters contributed to her resignation announced this week, according to 
district records released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A nine-page resignation agreement, worked out during six closed-door sessions, 
states that there was a "controversy between the board and Dr. Peters over her 
employment relationship" that would likely result in legal disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Peters nor district officials would discuss the exact reasons for her 
departure, however. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the district to pay Peters $126,952 in exchange for her 
promise not to sue the district for dismissing her before the end of her 
contract, which expires in June, 1993. Peters' resignation will be effective 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Since Peters' departure was announced Wednesday, officials have remained 
tight-lipped about the matter because the resignation agreement includes a gag 
order forbidding board members and Peters from publicly discussing the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Board members . . . and Dr. Peters shall not make any disparaging or 
derogatory remarks, comments or statements regarding each other," the terms 
state. And, both sides "agree to report publicly that this agreement is an 
amicable resolution of philosophical differences between Dr. Peters and the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
District officials have said only that differences developed between Peters and 
the board just a year after it gave her a glowing review and extended her 
contract. She has been superintendent for four years. 
</P>
<P>
The document lends support to many teachers' and parents' claims that the board 
requested Peters' resignation under pressure from the teachers' union. Leaders 
of the Huntington Beach Elementary Teachers Assn. blame Peters for labor 
tensions that have deepened in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
During 1989-90 contract talks that were stalled for nearly a year, teachers 
frequently berated Peters and trustees at board meetings. Union leaders said 
they had been planning a campaign to oust three board members scheduled to face 
reelection Nov. 6 if they continued to support Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees and Peters have refused to comment on what role the union might have 
played in her resignation. 
</P>
<P>
The payment to Peters is not related to salary compensation, the agreement 
says. It represents the amount of the remainder of her contract. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the district is scheduled to deliver the full payment to 
the outgoing superintendent by Aug. 15. A 10% annual interest charge would be 
tacked on to any amount that remains unpaid at that date. 
</P>
<P>
Peters praised the district after her resignation and talked only about "the 
many positive things" she believes occurred in the district during her tenure. 
</P>
<P>
As for her future plans, Peters, 44, said this week that "I'll be open to 
everything," although she hopes to continue living in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to take my time and be very open about my possibilities," she said. 
"Of course, it helps having an agreement that takes care of me financially for 
awhile." JOHN PENNER

ARGENTINIAN AWAITS MARROW TRANSPLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERYLANNE BEALER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oksana Hural had never been to the United States before, but since arriving in 
Orange County this week, the 19-year-old Argentinian's view of America has been 
limited to hospital rooms, examination tables and laboratory equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Hural is set to undergo a bone marrow transplant at St. Joseph's Hospital in 
Orange on Tuesday. Her doctors have said that the transplant is the only cure 
for her three-year bout with leukemia. After the operation, Hural will spend 
three to six weeks in the hospital and another month here as an outpatient, 
said her doctor, Winston Ho. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she wants to go to Disneyland when this is all over with, but until 
then, she has to take it very easy," said Maria Perez, a fellow Argentinian who 
is caring for Hural at her San Clemente home. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, a member of the San Clemente Sister City Assn., has led a countywide 
fund-raising drive for Hural's hospitalization and medical expenses. Ho is 
performing the transplant for free. 
</P>
<P>
So far, $50,000 in donations has been received, including a $10,000 grant from 
the Buena Park Firefighters' Assn. The money came from a trust fund for an 
18-year-old Buena Park girl, Noemi Serrano, who died before receiving a heart 
and lung transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Perez started the drive in April after residents of San Clemente's sister city 
in Argentina, San Clemente del Tuyu, wrote asking for help for Hural. The 
letter explained that Hural's mother was dead, her father was ill and the tiny 
village had exhausted all of its charitable resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Argentina is very poor. They're in need of everything," Perez said. "The 
doctors there just can't do this kind of operation." 
</P>
<P>
Hural will undergo an "auto-transplant," an operation using her own bone marrow 
rather than that of a donor. On Friday, doctors removed a bone marrow specimen, 
leaving small lesions on Hural's collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not scared at all," said Hural, who speaks only Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The thin, pale teen-ager was once given one month to live by her Argentinian 
doctors, but chemotherapy treatments and medicine have since put her disease 
into remission. 
</P>
<P>
But Hural credits her family for seeing her through her illness. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister came to give me strength," Hural explained, holding tightly to the 
hand of her 23-year-old sister, Maria, who accompanied her on the long plane 
ride from Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
If the transplant is successful, Hural said she hopes to return to Argentina, 
finish her remaining three years of high school and attend college. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very grateful to everyone here who has helped me," she said. "But I am 
very homesick." CHERYLANNE BEALER

JOBS PLUS HELPS OUT LOW-INCOME YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 300 students from 10 North County cities are working for government and 
nonprofit agencies as part of the Summer Youth Employment Program operated here 
by Jobs Plus. 
</P>
<P>
The $600,000 program offers jobs to youths ages 14 to 21 who meet the federal 
government's low-income requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs Plus director Linda Daughters said most of the workers receive minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs Plus can also make job referrals for youths who do not come from 
low-income families, said Vicky Casillas, a program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're 17 or 18 years old and have good transferable skills, we try to 
place them in the private sector, whether they are eligible for the program or 
not," Casillas said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to La Habra, the summer employment program serves Brea, Buena Park, 
Cypress, Fullerton, La Palma, Placentia, Rossmoor, Los Alamitos, Stanton, Yorba 
Linda and part of La Mirada. Daughters said summer school students are not only 
eligible but are paid for attending classes in many cases. 
</P>
<P>
Recruitment for the program began in the spring, when counselors visited 
schools, held career days and posted flyers in libraries and other public 
places. 
</P>
<P>
The application process requires prospective workers to make two trips to the 
Jobs Plus office in the basement of La Habra City Hall. Then they must go for 
at least one job interview. A final visit to the office to pick up paper work 
is required before reporting to work. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows us if the kid will be responsible," Casillas said. "If a youngster is 
willing to make three or four trips to City Hall before starting work, he or 
she is likely to be a reliable employee." 
</P>
<P>
Casillas said one of the objectives of the program is to show participants "the 
importance of how education and work experience go hand in hand." 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters interested in competing for one of about 20 remaining openings may 
contact the Jobs Plus office at (213) 905-9744. DAVID F. BURKE

RESIDENTS LOBBY FOR THEIR SMALL TOWN

<P>
At this week's Town Hall meeting, concerns that Brea's small-town atmosphere 
was under siege overshadowed discussions about the city's traffic, noise and 
glut of office space. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker after speaker and caller after caller, the later watching at home on 
Brea's cable TV channel, addressed the City Council about what they considered 
to be the adverse impacts of the city's ambitious redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Councilman Ron Isles' remarks that downtown redevelopment represented a 
"heart transplant" for the city, several residents were more concerned about 
what would happen to the old heart -- the downtown merchants whose shops have 
lined Brea Boulevard for years. 
</P>
<P>
"Small merchants add a special feel to the small-town atmosphere," Bev Perry 
told the council and audience of about 75 people. "I'd hate to see Brea become 
a city of franchises." 
</P>
<P>
Another caller asked the council and the rest of the city to remember the 
loyalty and support these merchants have shown the city. 
</P>
<P>
Both residents were assured that the new downtown would have a place for the 
mom-and-pop establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Not so easily answered were questions regarding the financing of downtown 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers and callers wanted assurances that the redevelopment agency 
had the funds to pay for the entire project and to pay for the debt that would 
be incurred. 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, resident Bill Vega asked how much the project would end up 
costing taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to know what percentage (of the price tag) is the developer's money 
covering. How much is put into redevelopment bonds? How much is going to be 
paid down the line (by taxpayers)?" Vega asked. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wayne D. Wedin said the city could not reveal cost information now 
because it is still negotiating an agreement with the developer. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that the figures would be available in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Of equal concern to residents was development in general, which has been 
chipping away at Brea's small-town atmosphere -- the very thing that attracted 
them to the city in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
A caller who identified himself as W. C. Larry asked bluntly: "Why haven't you 
stopped all the building?" 
</P>
<P>
Others echoed that sentiment, complaining about increased traffic and noise. 
More residential and commercial development will only add to those problems, 
they said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

EX-UCI LECTURERS FIGHT DISMISSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. PIERRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defending two UC Irvine lecturers of Chinese language who were notified in May 
that their contracts would not be renewed, a representative of the American 
Federation of Teachers charged Friday that the university acted in an 
"arbitrary and capricious" manner. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this was total disregard for equal opportunity," said Daniel C. 
Tsang, vice president of AFT Local 2206, after a grievance hearing before the 
dean of the School of Humanities. "Neither of them received an interview for 
the positions." 
</P>
<P>
Tsang is seeking the immediate reinstatement of Richard Liao and Jennie Hu, 
both of whom filed grievances with the university after three new lecturers 
were hired to replace them in the newly formed East Asian languages and 
literature department. 
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that if the current grievance is unsuccessful, he will appeal to 
William Parker, acting executive vice chancellor. A decision is expected within 
the next 10 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Tsang said he believes Liao and Hu were treated unfairly, the university 
maintains that both were treated appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the applicants are not required to receive an interview," said 
university spokeswoman Linda Granell, noting that each year there is a new 
hiring process for all one-year positions, provided those positions are 
continued the following year. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, these lectureships were advertised and applicants were sought 
from across the country and people were selected to fill those positions," 
Granell said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a waste of taxpayers' money to do a national search for year-to-year 
appointments when you have qualified people locally," Tsang said, suggesting 
that Liao may have been let go because he would have been eligible for an 
extended three-year contract during the 1990-91 school term. 
</P>
<P>
After six years, lecturers become eligible for extended contracts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The university does not operate like that," responded Granell. 
</P>
<P>
Both Liao and Hu received letters on March 27 notifying them that the 
university was interviewing applicants for the lectureships and both indicated 
their interest. But neither of them was contacted for an interview, Tsang said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very suspicious," he said, noting that Liao was shocked when his contract 
was not renewed as it has been for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Liao "assumed that since he had never had to go through this before, everything 
was fine." 
</P>
<P>
Granell said interviews are done in some cases but are not mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Liao, who holds two master's degrees in Asian studies, received consistently 
favorable reviews from students and university observers, according to his 
personnel file. 
</P>
<P>
Evaluations for the six courses taught by Liao during the fall, 1987, and 
winter, 1988, terms, show that 63% of his students rated his classes as "one of 
the best," while another 32% rated his class as "above average," according to a 
listing for the 1988-89 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this job," Liao said, noting that because of budget limitations he 
often purchased teaching materials with his own money. He is currently teaching 
part time at Santa Monica City College. 
</P>
<P>
Hu, who taught at the university for three years, is a native of China and 
received a bachelor's degree in Chinese literature. 
</P>
<P>
She was out of the country Friday and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three people recently hired as lecturers for the upcoming term, one 
holds a doctorate degree and all are natives of China. 
</P>
<P>
Granell said she could not release the names of the three until they officially 
become UCI employees when school begins in September. ROBERT E. PIERRE

FREE DAY CARE FOR SPECIAL FOSTER KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like most mothers with babies, Karen Harvey laughs at the idea of free time. So 
when Advanced Resources for Foster Kids in Anaheim offered her four hours of 
free day care on Friday afternoon, she jumped at the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to lunch with my husband, hopefully down by the beach, something 
romantic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, like other mothers dropping off infants and toddlers at the center, 
brought more than a diaper bag for her 7-month-old foster son. She also brought 
a machine that feeds the blue-eyed baby one drop of formula at a time through a 
tube into his stomach, plus special instructions for burping and changing the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Other mothers brought breathing machines and more special instructions. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters are foster children, the majority of whom were born to 
drug-addicted mothers, who need round-the-clock attention, said Liz Lafferty, 
executive director of the center. 
</P>
<P>
For Harvey, that means feeding a baby son whose digestive system is so troubled 
that it takes him two hours to drink and digest 4 ounces of formula. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's offer of free day care for foster children with special needs begins 
what center operators hope will be a new service available on a monthly basis. 
</P>
<P>
The center offers regular day care twice a week for foster children, but 
mingling the medically sensitive kids with the others was "overwhelming for the 
volunteers," said Lafferty. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Kaminski, who works at the center, decided to organize a special day 
just for the kids with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
One nurse and three volunteers, plus Lafferty and Kaminski, joined forces to 
give the moms a day off and the kids a place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"When a foster parent gives up, that child's life is hell," said Lafferty. "We 
want to look at the foster parent and say, 'How can we help? What can we do?' 
If a foster mother wants to go off and take a bubble bath, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Baths and lunches with friends were high on the foster parents' list of 
priorities Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Darden, who dropped off her four foster children -- all of whom had been 
drug-addicted infants -- said she couldn't believe the center's offer. 
</P>
<P>
She said her free time would be spent "going to the hospital to look at another 
baby. And to have a nail fixed." LISA MASCARO

AIRPORT PROJECT CONTRACTOR FILES 2ND LAWSUIT AGAINST COUNTY 
</P>

The John Wayne Airport expansion project's prime contractor, which has already 
sued Orange County for stripping it of a $25-million parking lot and road 
contract, filed a second lawsuit Friday claiming that the county's agreement 
with another company to complete the job is illegal and void. 
</P>
<P>
The contractor, Taylor Woodrow Construction California Ltd., claims in the 
lawsuit that an indemnity agreement absolving the new parking lot contractor, 
McCarthy Brothers construction company, from liability on the project, violates 
state law in part because it places too much potential liability on the 
county's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
The company also claims that the county's agreement to pay McCarthy Brothers as 
much as $1.6 million to complete the project violated state competitive bidding 
requirements, and asks the court to order work on the parking lot halted and 
allow Taylor Woodrow to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow lost the parking lot project in May when the County Board of 
Supervisors voted to strip them of the contract because of construction delays. 
The company sued the county for breach of contract and is seeking $7.2 million 
in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, county supervisors awarded the contract to complete the job 
to Irvine-based McCarthy Brothers, even though Taylor Woodrow claimed that it 
could finish the job for one-fourth of the $1.6 million the new contractor was 
asking. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow remains the prime contractor on the $62-million airport terminal 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the county could not be reached Friday, but Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton called the suit "a defensive move" intended to assuage the concerns of 
Taylor Woodrow's prospective clients. 
</P>
<P>
"They're probably going to leave this one on the books for years," Stanton 
said. "They can . . . say the Orange County situation is unresolved because 
it's in litigation."

COUNTY AGENCIES SUE SOCIAL SECURITY OVER AID FOR MENTALLY ILL 
</P>

<P>
Several Orange County agencies that aid the poor filed suit Friday in federal 
court against the Social Security Administration, contending that the agency 
gives insufficient help to poor people with mental disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of all people in Orange County who might qualify 
for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, demands that Social Security mount a 
massive outreach program to identify potential SSI beneficiaries and help them 
get through the complicated application process. 
</P>
<P>
Although the complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
attorneys said it was assigned to U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler, 
who sits in Santa Ana. Lawyers in the case are not seeking any immediate court 
orders to change Social Security's practices, but they expect that a full trial 
on the issues will be held before Judge Stotler. 
</P>
<P>
A Social Security spokesman said the agency is trying to improve its outreach 
programs for potential SSI beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we feel that everyone out there knows and has the chance to apply, we're 
not going to be satisfied," said Eddie Cooksey, Social Security's deputy 
regional public affairs officer in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
He said the agency is considering using $3 million recently allocated by 
Congress to pay local mental health agencies to get the word out to the 
mentally ill that they might qualify for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Cooksey said there are claims representatives in each Social Security office 
who can help people complete the forms. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants must complete a three-page form. Then, if they appear to qualify for 
benefits, they must return and finish a 10-page form, he said.

WEIGHT-LOSS PRODUCT CAL-BAN IS EMBARGOED AT ORANGE WAREHOUSE

<P>
State health investigators staked out a warehouse early Friday, then placed an 
embargo on more than 8 million capsules and tablets of a weight-loss product 
called Cal-Ban 3000 that is suspected of causing intestinal obstructions. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from D&amp;F Industries, a health-products manufacturer with offices 
in Anaheim and Orange, could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But Dan Walsh, a spokesman for the state Department of Health Services' food 
and drug branch, said D&amp;F appears to be a major national manufacturer of 
Cal-Ban 3000, a weight-loss product advertised and distributed by Health Care 
Products Inc., also known as Anderson Pharmacals of Lutz, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
D&amp;F's records show that from Jan. 1 to July 17, it shipped more than 177 
million tablets and capsules with a retail value of $9.3 million to the Florida 
distributor, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Irvine attorney Lawrence Eisenberg disclosed that he had sued 
Health Care Products for negligence after a Huntington Beach man who took the 
product last year required emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Scherze, 48, was taking Cal-Ban 3000 as a diet aid, Eisenberg said, but 
"in the course of trying to swallow the tablet, it lodged in his esophagus and 
remained implanted." 
</P>
<P>
Scherze was rushed to the emergency room at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital 
and Medical Center last July 31, where he required esophogeal surgery to have 
the tablet removed, according to Eisenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenberg said medical experts have described Cal-Ban 3000 as "an inherently 
dangerous product. It can expand on the way down the throat." 
</P>
<P>
State health director Ken Kizer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the 
Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services all claim that the 
product, which sells for about $25 a bottle, is a health hazard and have 
ordered retailers to remove it from their shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Its main ingredient, a plant derivative called guar gum, swells when wet. 
Although guar gum has been used safely in small amounts to thicken foods, when 
taken in 500-milligram tablet or capsule form for weight loss, it can block the 
esophagus, stomach or intestine, health officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA has reported 20 cases of internal obstructions associated with Cal-Ban 
3000 and Florida's health services reported more than 100 adverse reactions to 
the product. Also, an Arkansas resident who took Cal-Ban is reported to have 
died from complications after surgery to remove an esophageal obstruction, 
California health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said Health Care Products' files have revealed at least 22 complaints of 
adverse reactions from Californians, including a June, 1989, complaint of 
"esophogeal obstruction" from a Huntington Beach man and a report of a "stomach 
ache" from an Irvine man this June. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to embargoing 456,000 tablets, 7.9 million capsules and 9,748 
unlabeled bottles of the guar gum product at D&amp;F's Orange warehouse and 
packing plant Friday, health investigators who searched the firm's Anaheim 
manufacturing plant Thursday placed an embargo on another 3.35 million capsules 
and 4 million tablets, Walsh said.

NEWPORT BEACH SEEKS WAYS TO FURTHER REDUCE BALBOA CRUISING

<P>
To help control the growing popularity of a Balboa Peninsula shopping plaza as 
a hangout for teen-agers, police, retailers and property owners are considering 
more ways to reduce cruising in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ruthelyn Plummer said the City Council will also address the issue at a 
future study session. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's meeting, council members heard renewed complaints about noise 
and congestion in the shopping center at 32nd Street and Balboa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Plummer said there needs to be more effort by the city to limit cruising. Among 
other things, City Manager Robert L. Wynn said, the city has asked Carl's Jr., 
the anchor restaurant in the plaza, to shorten its weekend hours. The request 
is being evaluated by restaurant management. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions between the city and business owners about the problem have been 
ongoing, said Sgt. Andy Gonis, a police spokesman, who added that the Police 
Department is "dealing with the problem as best we can." 
</P>

Currently, barricades are erected at the shopping center's parking lot every 
Friday and Saturday night, and a private security firm has been hired to 
control access to the plaza.

<P>
Police regularly patrol the lot, issuing citations for curfew and alcohol 
violations. Gonis said the department receives an average of two calls a week 
about noise disturbances in the area.

Joan Kroc knows. Being the owner of a major league baseball team is not all 
champagne, cheers and excitement. It also comes with headaches and heartaches. 
</P>
<P>
I hope she warned Tom Werner. 
</P>
<P>
I hope she told him owning the Padres was more than sharing the team's 
experience of winning the National League Championship Series and Tony Gwynn's 
experiences winning batting titles and Mark Davis' experience winning the Cy 
Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
Downs come with those ups. 
</P>
<P>
In her tenure as owner, she also had to deal with losing two players to drug 
problems, listening to a star player complain that her hamburgers were 
poisoning the world and watching as her club president saluted hecklers with a 
most inappropriate finger. 
</P>
<P>
And none of those problems were even of her own doing, except maybe hiring that 
particular club president in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The new owner, or at least the chairman of the new ownership by committee, did 
a very wise thing upon assuming command. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Werner announced that Joan Kroc would be honored with a night of her own. 
It would be July 27. Last night. The gesture was nice, and it was fitting. The 
woman had ruled this franchise with grace and elegance since her husband, Ray, 
passed away in 1984. The community loved the Krocs, who made it easy by being 
the way they were. 
</P>
<P>
However, being loved isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Werner knows. 
</P>
<P>
Now. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, does he know. 
</P>
<P>
In the same week he was honoring Joan Kroc, and in the same week he should have 
been enjoying a remarkable upswing by his theretofore struggling team, he got 
hit in the face and eardrums by a public relations nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Roseanne Barr. 
</P>
<P>
His Roseanne Barr. 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine two women so totally different in class and style at the same 
microphone in the same stadium in the same week? This is like one of those 
vulgar rap groups opening for a Neil Diamond or Barbra Streisand. It would be 
like hanging a pre-school finger painting next to a Renoir, except it would be 
denigrating to a 4-year-old to say he or she couldn't paint as well as Barr 
sang. 
</P>
<P>
Barr, as everyone from here to Maine knows by now, attempted to sing the 
national anthem Wednesday night. What she did was screech the anthem, hitting 
every note imaginable . . . but none in the right places. 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine the chagrin of the guy in Detroit who was awakened by Barr's 
star-mangled banner on his clock radio Thursday morning? He probably thought 
there was a cat fight in his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
And that's right, Barr's version of the anthem got air time on virtually every 
radio station in the country, plus all major television networks. Dan Rather 
had it, for heaven's sake. 
</P>
<P>
And that was just the audio. 
</P>
<P>
The visual was worse. 
</P>
<P>
When she finished, she grabbed her crotch and spit. I understand this was 
supposed to be a parody of what ballplayers do. Sorry, Roseanne, but that's 
even tasteless when the ballplayers do it. 
</P>
<P>
What was she doing there? 
</P>
<P>
Tom Werner invited her. 
</P>
<P>
Uh-oh. 
</P>
<P>
She works for Werner. She is a comedienne with one of the top-rated shows on 
television, which is sad testimony to the garbage people will watch. And she is 
not a singer. 
</P>
<P>
But Werner asked her to sing between games of a doubleheader on what was billed 
as Working Women's Night at the ball park. Working women deserved much better. 
And I'm not sure Lassie wouldn't have been better, if Werner was compelled to 
bring a star to his new community. 
</P>
<P>
So Tom Werner is to blame? 
</P>
<P>
Surely, he did not expect to get what he got. No way in the world. He had to 
think she would prepare herself to make a sincere effort. You just don't mess 
with the national anthem, not here or any place else. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Werner, the accountability is his. He is the chairman of this 
ownership group. He's going to have to answer for batters who don't hit and 
pitchers who don't pitch, and those things are realistically beyond his 
control. Thus, he is even more accountable for situations he can control or 
should have recognized as potentially explosive, and you have to remember that 
this person, Barr, mooned the crowd at a World Series game last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Kroc once took over the stadium microphone to apologize for the play of his 
team. 
</P>
<P>
This might have been an occasion when Tom Werner should have taken over the 
stadium microphone and apologized for his star. And don't tell me it would have 
embarrassed her. I don't think that would have been possible. 
</P>
<P>
Right, Joan? 
</P>
<P>
By the way, congratulations on your night. 
</P>
<P>
And I hope you had a few words of advice for Mr. Werner.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: DENTICARE BEGINS TALKS WITH STATE OVER HMO, INDEMNITY 
INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Officials of National Health Care Systems Inc., responding to the state's 
forbidding its Denticare of California subsidiary from selling indemnity 
medical insurance or enrolling new members in its health maintenance 
organization, said this week's state action is unjustified and may be 
unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
However, the company added in a prepared statement, "for the benefit of the 
company's enrollees and to avoid the expense and uncertainty of litigation," 
Denticare on Thursday began negotiations with the state Department of 
Corporations, the state agency that oversees HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the department accused the company of illegally marketing 
indemnity insurance without authorization from the state Department of 
Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-1988, Denticare has been offering employers what it calls a 
"dual-choice option" -- both an HMO and traditional indemnity medical 
insurance. But the company said Friday that only about 9,000 of its 240,000 
members are enrolled in plans that have indemnity coverage.

Jobless rate: Orange County's unemployment rate bumped up a notch in June to 
3.3%, from 3.2% in May, as thousands of high school and college students looked 
for summer jobs. But the jobless rate remained one of the lowest in the state 
-- trailing only Marin County's 2.9% and San Mateo County's 3%. The June rate 
was also unchanged from June, 1989, while the total number of unemployed, 
46,100, was almost 3% lower than the year-earlier tally of 47,500.

Pittson Co.: In an unusual move, Pittson Co. has elevated two executives in its 
Burlington Air Express subsidiary in Irvine to serve as joint chief executives 
of the international air freight firm. The move follows the promotion earlier 
this month of David L. Marshall, Burlington's chairman and chief executive 
since 1987, to the posts of vice chairman and chief financial officer of 
Connecticut-based Pittson. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Marshall as Burlington's joint chief executives are Roger I. 
MacFarlane, president of Burlington's U.S. subsidiary for the last two years, 
and Peter Thorrington, head of the company's international unit since mid-1988. 
Marshall will remain chairman of Burlington. A Pittson spokesman said Friday 
that this is the first time the company has named joint CEOs at a subsidiary.

GARDENING;

<P>
WINDOW BOXES ADD COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Window boxes are something the British whip up exceptionally well. They brim 
with a kaleidoscope of color: lavender lobelia, red-and-white stripped 
petunias, pink pelargoniums, orange geraniums, magenta china asters, and, of 
course, sprigs of English ivy. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you live on massive acreage or in a small apartment, window box 
dressing gives a special kind of gardening pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that there is no magic in creating your own showcase window 
box. All you need is a container, soil, a small variety of flowers and some 
foliage imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Simple containers are the most versatile; they blend with most architectural 
styles and don't detract from the plants growing inside. Neutral colors -- 
gray, beige, brown, natural wood, white -- are the best complements. 
</P>
<P>
Boxes are made of wood, metal, stone, fiberglass, plastic or clay. 
</P>
<P>
Wood -- either redwood, pine or cedar -- is the "traditional" choice for window 
boxes. A 24-inch-by-12-inch redwood box costs about $25. Redwood resists 
rotting and adds a touch of country. Painted white, it offers a traditional 
look. 
</P>
<P>
Clay boxes are romantic and whimsical. Italian terra cotta clay containers 
blend well with almost any floral selection. They can be bought or painted 
white for a dressier look. There is a new plastic window box that looks like 
clay. 
</P>
<P>
Metal and stone boxes are more modern and sleek. Exotic chiseled stone boxes 
are hard to find, difficult to maneuver and expensive -- but elegant. 
Fiberglass boxes are durable in hot and cold weather and are relatively 
inexpensive. One popular model sold by numerous mail-order garden-supply 
companies looks like white-painted wood. Fiberglass boxes are also easy to 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
Where to put your flower boxes? Find a spot where they can slip in easily -- 
fitting onto a windowsill or doorway ledge. If your windowsill is wide enough, 
a window box can simply rest upon it. Anchor the box with rocks in the back to 
make sure it does not slide or blow off the sill. If your window sill slopes 
forward, as many do, place wedges of wood under the front of the box to level 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Few tools are required for window box gardening. You will need a cultivator to 
aerate the soil and scratch in granular fertilizers, a watering can, a hand 
sprayer for misting and feeding, pruning shears for trimming shrubs and 
clipping dead flowers, a small trowel for digging planting holes and a dibble 
for planting seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Coloring your window box with flowers is where you get to be as wild or as 
timid as you wish. You can go neon-rainbow with bright, mixed color, or 
monochromatic for a serene color scheme. 
</P>
<P>
If you want soft harmony, plant analogous or related color schemes, those close 
to one another on the artist's color wheel, like pink and purple; red, orange 
and yellow; or pastels. White flowers or silver foliage can be added to lighten 
and brighten the effect. 
</P>
<P>
A monochromatic box idea would be to set pink chrysanthemums and rose 
pelargoniums inside English ivy. Or purple china asters, pink and white 
petunias and lavender lobelia. Try different shades of lobelia, from deep 
purple to palest lavender with impatiens in rose and light pink amid cascading 
Swedish ivy. 
</P>
<P>
The English cottage garden look requires more contrasting color. Let your 
imagination run riot with polychromatic color schemes. The appeal of window box 
gardening is that you can rarely make a bad choice with too much color. 
</P>
<P>
Red petunias, yellow marigolds, pink pelargoniums, blue china asters, white 
nasturtiums, lavender lobelia, stripped sweet Williams, scarlet snapdragons -- 
or any combination of color -- gives a window box a charming 
"the-more-the-merrier-look." 
</P>
<P>
My favorite window box sat outside my dorm room in London -- a white wood box 
filled with lavender, pink and red lobelia, Swedish and English ivy, scarlet 
impatiens, rose and pink geraniums, red wax begonias, white petunias and sweet 
Williams. How do I remember it so well? Some memories you carry with you like a 
photograph. 
</P>
<P>
When making your plant choices, consider the plants' height and width since a 
good mixture makes for a more pleasing box. 
</P>
<P>
Dip your hand into some unusual plants. For height, experiment with 
lavender-blue catmints, white candytufts, wish-bone flowers (lavender flowers 
with deep purple markings and a yellow spot), rosy speedwell or sapphire 
flowers (good for front-of-window boxes). For width, try Kolomikta vine (leaves 
splashed with pink and white), dusty miller, silver-lace (lacy silver foliage), 
love-in-a-mist, snow-on-the-mountain (white-edged green leaves) or lovingstone 
daisy (neon-like colors). 
</P>
<P>
There are three options for putting plants in window boxes. You can plant 
directly in the boxes, plant removable liners that fit inside the boxes, or 
plant in individual pots sunk into peat moss inside the boxes. Regardless of 
the method you use, every box and liner need drainage holes in the bottom. In 
stone trough containers in which you cannot drill drainage holes, put a layer 
of gravel in the bottom of the box to improve drainage. 
</P>
<P>
Soil mixes for window boxes are the same as those for your houseplants and 
other outdoor containers. Start with packaged potting soil and mix it with a 
source of organic matter -- compost that you have crumbled into small pieces or 
pressed through a sieve, peat moss or leaf mold. To lighten the soil's texture, 
add some vermiculite, perlite or builder's sand. A good all-purpose formula is 
three parts soil; two parts compost, leaf mold or peat moss; and one part 
vermiculite, perlite or sand. If you are growing flowers from bulbs, add some 
bone meal for extra phosphorus. 
</P>
<P>
When planting, leave enough space between plants to allow them to grow to their 
full size. Many people make the mistake of crowding the roots during planting. 
</P>
<P>
If you are transplanting, dig holes large enough to accommodate all the roots. 
Set the transplants at the same depth they were growing in their previous flat. 
Leave the soil level about an inch below the top of each box, to allow room for 
watering. 
</P>
<P>
Window boxes need regular fertilizing and watering. In hot, dry weather, water 
once or twice a day, whenever the soil feels dry an inch or two below the 
surface. Make sure the soil is moistened all the way through and all the roots 
receive water. 
</P>
<P>
Window boxes are not just for flowers. Herbs such as dill, garlic, chives, 
thyme, sage, basil and parsley can be grown in these rectangles. For a little 
lettuce crop, plant the romaine cultivar "little gem," and small-rooted carrots 
such as "little finger" are successful in a box. 
</P>
<P>
The grandest thing about window boxes? For the little amount of time and effort 
you expend on them, they'll bring sparkle to your garden, and hours of pleasure 
each time you peek outside your window. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A WINDOW BOX SAMPLER 
</P>
<P>
Selecting the flowers to fill a window box requires consideration of color, 
height, width and design scheme. A monochromatic color scheme would use flowers 
with similar colors, like pink chrysanthemums and rose pelargoniums. A 
polychromatic scheme mixes a combination of color, like red petunias, yellow 
marigolds, pink pelargoniums, blue china asters, white nasturtiums, lavender 
lobelia, stripped sweet Williams and scarlet snapdragons. 
</P>
<P>
A good mixture of height and width adds to the appearance of a flower box. The 
rule of thumb: Plants such as pelargoniums, geraniums, china asters, 
snapdragons add height. Lobelia, phlox, impatiens, petunias add width and 
depth. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of plant choices: 
</P>
<P>
Ageratum: Flat, fuzzy clusters of violet-blue flowers cover this foot-tall 
plant, which can be used as a good filler. 
</P>
<P>
Alyssum: It grows in low mounds of white, pinkish purple or dark purple 
flowers. Dwarf kinds are dense and stay under 4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Aster: Growing to various sizes, flowers come in white or shades of blue, red, 
pink, lavender or purple, mostly with yellow centers. 
</P>
<P>
Begonia: Planted for texture, the multicolored foliage has saucer-size flowers 
and/or lacy clusters of smaller flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Cabbage, flowering: It is used for its highly ornamental, highly colored leaf 
rosettes that look like giant peonies in deep blue green marbled and edged with 
white, cream, rose or purple. 
</P>
<P>
Calendula: Besides familiar orange and bright yellow double, daisylike 
blossoms, there are more subtle shades of apricot, cream and soft yellow. The 
leaves are aromatic leaves and they grow one to two feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Candytuft: Low-growing mounts of narrow, deep green leaves are completely 
obscured by short spikes of white flowers in spring and early summer. Snowflake 
is an especially dense variety. A good filler among taller perennials, most 
grow a foot tall or less. 
</P>
<P>
Catmint: Soft, gray green, undulating mounds of lavender-blue flowers grow to 
two feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Celosia: There are two kinds, crested cockscomb with bizarre, contorted flower 
heads, and plume celosia with feathery plumes. There are varieties of each that 
grow from 1 to 3 feet tall and both come in outrageous shades of yellow, 
orange, gold and crimson. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysanthemum: Available in many flower forms, plant and flower sizes, they 
also come in a variety of colors including pink, white butter, yellow, red, 
orange, bronze, purple, lavender and multicolors. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlia: Miniatures stay under 1 1/2 feet and offer superb shades of yellow, 
orange, red, pink and white. 
</P>
<P>
Dusty miller: A coarse plant with distinctively cut gray leaves and pale yellow 
flowers, it grows to two feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Fuchsia: This popular, showy flowered plant comes in hundreds of varieties and 
colors. The California fuchsia spreads to form loose stands of 2-foot flower 
spikes splattered with red in late summer. 
</P>
<P>
Geranium: Not to be confused with pelargoniums, geraniums have snowflake leaves 
with deep purple, bright pink or blue flowers that grow from under a foot to 2 
feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Gerbera: These South African plants produce huge daisylike flowers in deep, 
warm shades of yellow, orange, red and pink. Clumps of dark green foliage stay 
under a foot tall. 
</P>
<P>
Golden fleece: A very dainty daisy flower with fine, threadlike foliage and 
soft, chamois-colored blossoms, it never grows taller than a foot. 
</P>
<P>
Impatiens: A varied group of striking bright flowers comes in a bewildering 
variety of colors from scarlet and deep purple to stripes or splashes of color 
mixes. Single-flowered kinds cover themselves neatly with a mass of flowers; 
doubles have attractive flowers like little rosebuds. 
</P>
<P>
Love-in-a-mist: A pretty flower with thorny-looking leaves, it grows 20 inches 
tall, 12 inches wide. 
</P>
<P>
Lobelia: Six-inch-tall plants, often with dark reddish foliage and bright blue 
to violet flowers, it is a good filler that contrasts nicely with summer's many 
golden flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Marigold: The tiniest are the 8- to 10-inch signet marigolds that have almost 
ferny foliage and delicate little flowers in vivid yellow, orange or crimson. 
The mid-sized French marigolds come in single or double flowered forms, in 
yellow, orange and crimson, often marked with maroon. All are neat and tidy and 
low-growing, 8 to 14 inches tall. The taller American or African marigolds grow 
1 1/2 to 3 feet tall with the biggest flowers on sturdy stems. Most are shades 
of yellow or orange. 
</P>
<P>
Nemesia: These foot-tall plants are covered with yellow, orange or red flowers, 
and just about every shade in between. 
</P>
<P>
Pansy: Dark contrasting markings bloom in shades of blue, purple, yellow, 
maroon and apricot. 
</P>
<P>
Petunia: Best grown early in the season before summer's heat and smog descend, 
there are single- and double-flowered forms. Grandifloras have large flowers 
and multifloras have more, smaller flowers and a neater appearance. Both come 
in shades of pink, red, salmon, purple, white and even pale yellow. All are 
under a foot tall. 
</P>
<P>
Portulaca: These low-spreading succulent plants have brilliant, shimmering 
flowers in shades of yellow, orange, red, cerise, coral and white. 
</P>
<P>
Salvia: Some new introductions from South America have shocking red or deep 
purple flowers and grow to three or four feet. 
</P>
<P>
Snapdragon: Available in an array of heights, types and colors, they grow from 
6 inches tall to 3 or 4 feet, in every color but blue and some that don't 
"snap." 
</P>
<P>
Speedwell: There are many kinds, and most have graceful blue spikes and grow no 
more than 2 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Stock: In muted lavender, pink and white, the flowers are sweetly scented on 1- 
to 2-foot-tall plants with grayish foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet William: These foot-tall carnation relatives have a decidedly 
old-fashioned look, with big clusters of flowers in shades of red, rose, pink 
and white. 
</P>
<P>
Verbena: These low-spreading plants have rounded clusters of white, pink, red 
or violet flowers and grow under a foot tall. 
</P>
<P>
Zinnia: The brightest of summer flowers, zinnias come in many sizes, forms and 
colors. The newest are dwarfs, most notably the foot-tall Peter Pan series, 
though there are zinnias even smaller. Tall zinnias reach about two feet tall. 
There are giant double types (the best known), giant tetra types (dahlialike 
flowers), and giant cactus types (lots of narrow, pointed petals). All come in 
brilliant shades.

<P>
Don't let that comradely, 500-watt, slopping-over-with-hospitality smile that 
cookbook authors press onto their faces for the dust cover photo make you lower 
your guard. These people are sadists. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the lists of ingredients at the top of the recipes make you get all 
Pavlovian, and you leap straight for the stove to lash together the perfect 
herb-chicken saute. But, as the $10-a-bottle olive oil and the clarified butter 
sizzle in the pan, and you turn back to the cookbook with dried herbs in hand, 
ready to follow the directions and sprinkle the supremes de poulet with 
preserved greenery, you read this: "Do not, under any circumstances, use dried 
herbs in this dish! If you do, the chicken will taste like floor sweepings and 
anyone who eats it will choke and die. Also, you will be revealed to the world 
as the villainous cook you really are. All herbs must be absolutely fresh!" 
</P>
<P>
At this point you can 1) continue using the dried stuff, phoning the book 
publishers in mid-saute to tell them the author is a pompous blowhard; 2) sling 
a little Marsala wine into the pan and save the day with the best booze-chicken 
combo ever invented, or 3) pluck a fistful of fresh herbs from your own 
personal herb garden and defiantly press on. 
</P>
<P>
You don't need a lot of handy space if you want to go with that last choice, 
just a lot of available sunlight, which, conveniently, is plentiful around 
here. You can grow them in any sunny plot of ground, but it's also possible to 
grow a tasty crop in an outdoor window box, said Kent Taylor, owner of Taylor's 
Herb Gardens in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
(You can grow your herbs indoors, Taylor said, but "they do their best outside, 
in an outside box or something where you can give them plenty of light and 
water.") 
</P>
<P>
"I've taken planter boxes about 1 foot by 1 foot by 20 inches long and put in 
six or eight herbs, which is really crowding it," Taylor said. "But you can do 
that, and it'll be good from now until about Christmas, when they'll start to 
crowd each other out. Generally, you want to put them about a foot apart." 
</P>
<P>
Commercially available potting soil works well in the outdoor box, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he said, all the herbs generally need is direct sunlight and 
plenty of water. And, about six weeks after you start the plants in the box, 
you'll be ready to harvest the sprigs of most herbs and toss them over that 
chicken you've been dying to cook. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said his nursery can supply seeds or plants for 130 varieties of herbs, 
both annuals and perennials, at a cost of about $1.35 for each plant. Here are 
a few of the more common ones that are worth considering: 
</P>
<P>
Basil. Since America went crazy for pesto sauce, people can't seem to get 
enough of this one. And many cookbook writers become almost fanatical about the 
use of fresh versus dried leaves. It's an annual and thrives, in a truly happy 
coincidence of nature, at almost exactly the same time that tomatoes become 
their ripest. Plant the basil and tomatoes at the same time, and you'll never 
have to walk more than a few steps for the freshest of all pasta sauces. 
</P>
<P>
Dill. Another trendy yet worthy herb. Plant it in full sun, water it well, and 
you can harvest it throughout the spring and summer. This one is relatively 
short-lived, but it's easy to grow from seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Tarragon. Another spring-and-summer herb, you can buy this plant from a garden 
center or nursery. It should be watered only during summer dry spells. 
</P>
<P>
Thyme. A perennial, similar to tarragon, that should be watered in about the 
same way. 
</P>
<P>
Oregano. Another essential in Italian cookery. It needs full sun and lots of 
water and can be harvested from spring to winter. 
</P>
<P>
Parsley. Buy this one in plant rather than seed form. Plant it in the early 
spring, keep it well watered, particularly in summer, and harvest it from late 
spring to late fall. 
</P>
<P>
Coriander. If you love Mexican food, you also know this one as cilantro. It's 
another one that is easy to grow from seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Some good news: Southern California weather is generally kind to herbs of many 
sorts, and plants such as rosemary, which is an annual in the northern states, 
can be grown and harvested for longer periods here. 
</P>
<P>
More good news: Take a look at those recipes that call for herbs, and you'll 
notice that many of them also include garlic. According to Taylor, garlic does 
well in planter boxes alongside herbs. Even though it's a bulb, garlic is small 
enough that it won't crowd the herbs in the box if planted properly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still more good news: You may find yourself heading for the herb garden instead 
of the medicine chest. Eucalyptus and thyme tend to loosen dry coughs, lavender 
oil rubbed on the temples can soothe tension headaches, and garlic can protect 
the respiratory and digestive systems against infection and help lower high 
blood pressure. Mint can also be a digestive aid. 
</P>
<P>
The inevitable drawback: a window box full of irises beats heck out of a box 
full of chives as a thing of beauty. But if your dinner guests wrinkle up their 
noses at your herb garden, put a little cream-of-daffodil-petal sauce on their 
salmon fillet. Stiff 'em on the fresh dill.

MEDIUM OF KNICKKNACKS RISES TO FINE ART

<P>
Back East they probably have a joke about Californians who live in glass 
houses. No doubt the punch line involves earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
And though Eileen Kremen has lived in a glass house of sorts for 17 years, she 
says she isn't worried. As owner of the Eileen Kremen Gallery in Fullerton, she 
knows that glass doesn't always live up to its fragile image. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sensuous and tactile," says Kremen, fingering the edge of a sculptural 
piece she has just installed for her summer show. "But it's not fragile. It 
doesn't frighten me." 
</P>
<P>
Since she began stocking glass paperweights and kaleidoscopes to show along 
with the painting and sculpture that characterized her gallery, Kremen's 
interest in glass art has grown with its supply. She beams about the current 
glass renaissance that has lined every available pedestal in her place with 
glass objects. The paperweights and kaleidoscopes have been relegated to a 
cabinet in the gift shop, and the paintings are gone. 
</P>
<P>
"Glass art has changed in the last two decades," Kremen says. "The artists have 
become more experimental, courageous and diverse, and they're integrating 
things like wood, metal and stone into their work." 
</P>
<P>
The art glass movement began in the early '60s when Harvey Littleton, an 
engineer working with a large commercial glass manufacturer, devised a 
small-scale method of producing blown glass. Littleton then had a show of the 
first crude vessels he produced, along with the furnace, tools and formulas he 
created to bring glass art into the realm of the individual artist. Suddenly, 
it seemed every artist was working in glass. 
</P>
<P>
Studios sprang up throughout the country using Littleton's technique. Among 
them was Correia Art Glass, a Santa Monica studio that produces original 
hand-blown glass for gallerys such as Lippe/Waren Fine Crystal in Laguna Beach 
and Pacesetters in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Sharp of Lippe/Waren says a problem for the collector of art glass is 
that old dichotomy: does one buy art for art's sake, or should the art object 
be capable of holding a fruit salad? He admits that the most popular glass art 
for the consumer is functional. 
</P>
<P>
So many glass artists choose lamps, goblets and vases as structures for their 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Joan Irving of San Diego has gained some notoriety for her hip 
functional art glass -- coffee tables, picture frames, bowls and bottles that 
have been cut, polished, slumped, sand blasted and then reverse-painted. 
</P>
<P>
"Magical things happen with glass," says Irving. "I'm fascinated by the quality 
of light that reflects from it and through it. It's very, very seductive." 
</P>
<P>
And as the vanity makes a comeback in home furnishings, so do the little 
perfume bottles that are displayed there, and Irving makes a lot of those. But 
this is only one way to collect glass, says Efrem Zimbalist III, chairman of 
Correia. 
</P>
<P>
"Glass should be collected like any fine art, because you love the piece -- 
because you respond to it. Not for its investment value," says Kremen. 
</P>
<P>
Zimbalist agrees, especially since art glass is generally not regarded as a 
mature art form. Though its presence on the secondary market is usually 
represented by Lalique crystal vases, Zimbalist says glass art can fetch as 
much as $100,000 in the galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Which would indicate that glass's status as a serious art form is indeed 
beginning to mature. Another indication could be the recent move of New York's 
premier glass dealer, the Heller Gallery, from its uptown Madison Avenue spot 
to Soho, the ephemeral downtown district where new art is being made and shown. 
You might say glass art is on the cutting edge. 
</P>
<P>
Artists and collectors alike are beginning to see new potential in glass, says 
Zimbalist. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology today is far superior to earlier glass art that is turning up 
at (major auction houses) Sotheby's and Christie's," he says, referring to the 
works of such glass heroes as Tiffany, Carter and Daum. The artist must grasp 
the physical properties of glass to manipulate its color and form. "Today's 
glass artist has to be both an aesthete and a technologist," Zimbalist adds. 
</P>
<P>
Glass is basically sand heated to its melting point, then cooled, a process 
discovered about 3,500 years ago. Its first applications were utilitarian, but 
the artistic possibilities inherent in blown glass resulted in decorative 
touches almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Sculptors like Toland Peter Sand use a high-tech coating on glass originally 
developed as lenses for heat-seeking missiles. Dichroic glass has been coated 
with thin metals that reflect certain wavelengths of light while allowing 
others to pass through, resulting in a color that is constantly changing. 
</P>
<P>
Artists and collectors are realizing that the play of light and color make 
glass a versatile and original material for art. And today's art patron is more 
sophisticated, opting for the wire/corrugated steel of a Frank Gehry design 
rather than the overwrought stained glass of building materials past. As an 
architectural element, glass can sometimes stand up to earthquakes.

REPLACING A FAULTY ELECTRICAL BREAKER SWITCH ISN'T AS TOUGH AS IT LOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. I have to replace a faulty breaker switch in my condominium and I've heard 
it's a relatively easy job. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
C.F., 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
A. "It looks tougher than it is, but you have got to know what you're doing," 
says Hector Carmona of Martenet Hardware in Anaheim. "Shut off the main power 
switch, then remove the panel that covers the breakers on your fuse box. The 
switches are either wired or clipped. Use a screwdriver to undo them and pull 
out the one you want. Take the broken switch to a hardware or electrical supply 
store so they can match up the correct one. Then replace it the same way it 
went in, replace the cover and turn on the power." 
</P>
<P>
Q. I'm afraid that my dog and cat don't mix with my new flower beds in the back 
yard. I've tried odor-causing repellents that work on my pets but also on me. 
Is there another way, short of ugly fencing, to keep pets out of the flowers? 
</P>
<P>
D.M., 
</P>
<P>
Brea 
</P>
<P>
A. "One fairly crude way is to sprinkle a substance such as Cayenne pepper 
around the bed," says Charles Kyle, manager of Nurseryland in Fountain Valley. 
"The pets sniff it, sneeze and decide to stay away from there. There's also a 
product called Tanglefoot that is a sticky, sappy substance used to keep ants 
and crawling insects off of fruit trees. You might place that around the bed 
since it makes the pet feel like it's stepped in gum. If your problem is only 
cats you might use just plain water. Watering your plants in the morning and 
keeping them moist would repel a cat since they like dry 'sandbox' soil." 
</P>
<P>
Q. In order to install a furnace thermostat, do I need to precisely level it 
for it to work properly? 
</P>
<P>
C.P., 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
A. "It should be level but you don't necessarily have to be exact," says Bill 
Elmore of P &amp; M Heating and Air Conditioning in Santa Ana. "You can simply 
use a carpenter's level or check the mercury bubble on those that have them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really not much to installing them, just check the furnace to see if 
you need a 24-volt thermostat or a millivolt thermostat. Usually, a forced-air 
attic furnace is a 24-volt system." 
</P>
<P>
Q. A neighbor of mine used rollers to paint the exterior of his stucco house 
and it took him about a day to complete. I've heard that using a sprayer is 
faster but also messier if you're not familiar with the machine. Which is best 
for the novice? 
</P>
<P>
J.H., 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 
</P>
<P>
A. "People have stopped using rollers for the exterior as paint sprayers have 
become easy to use," says Jim Livingston of Livingston Paint and Paperhouse in 
La Habra. "When you roll paint on, you're making it thinner and thinner and 
you're not painting an even coat. 
</P>
<P>
"When you use a spray gun, you're getting even coverage into all of the cracks 
and crevices. The airless spray equipment you can rent at your paint store is 
very easy to use, a novice could complete an exterior job in half a day. You 
just have to follow the directions, make sure the paint is properly thinned, 
that you have the right spray tip and that the guy you're renting it from goes 
over all of the features with you beforehand. Expect to pay about $45 to $60 
per day for the sprayer rental." 
</P>
<P>
Q. We recently bought a 4-year-old house that has some ugly oil stains on the 
concrete driveway. I've tried the chemical cleaners available at the hardware 
store, as well as going to my hands and knees with steel wool and a wire brush, 
and I still can't get rid of them. What are my options, short of building a new 
driveway? 
</P>
<P>
N.J., 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
A. If you've tried cleaning it by hand and you're still not satisfied, you're 
only other option is to call in a professional. "We clean concrete with 
superheated water combined with a biodegradable cleaner that's forced out of a 
nozzle at 3,000 pounds per square inch," says Jon Graves of Jon's Pressure 
Cleaning in Tustin. "That usually does the job. Then to save it or protect a 
new driveway, you might want to apply a sealer that will make oil and grease 
easier to remove. The rate to clean a driveway starts at about $100." 
</P>
<P>
Q. I'd love to install decorative glass blocks in a partition wall in our 
house. Is there anything I should know before tackling it myself? 
</P>
<P>
H.G., 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
A. "This isn't an easy job to do it yourself," says Michelle Wagner of Del Piso 
Tile in Anaheim. "The tiles are expensive, $4 to $21 a piece, so you have to 
know what you're doing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're building a free-standing wall, you have to use horizontal 
reinforcing rods to help support them, and if you're cutting a hole in a wall 
to create a window of glass blocks, you have to make sure it's the exact size 
you need, since you can't cut the blocks to fit. There's a special mortar to 
use as well that you can pick up where you buy the blocks." 
</P>
<P>
Q. I've seen a product in the store that attaches to your clothes dryer vent 
and supposedly uses the hot air when your running the dryer to help heat your 
house. Would something like this work? 
</P>
<P>
F.F., 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
A. "It will work," says Bill Couts of Couts Heating and Cooling in Anaheim. 
"It's just that the dryer has to be located in the house, not the garage, and 
it has to be electric, not gas. You also have to have a pretty good filter on 
it or you're going to get small lint particles around the house. But a clothes 
dryer would help warm up a house and it would provide humid air, which is 
needed since most furnaces provide dry heat."

THIRSTING FOR A GOOD DRINK? TRY TAPPING A SOURCE OF BOTTLED WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Distributed by AP Newsfeatures. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cracked cup that held his daily ration of water during World War II 
accompanied novelist Somerset Maugham on his travels. He kept the cup as a 
reminder that the best things in life are the simplest -- and the least 
appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Today, water is no longer simple or unappreciated. As regulations tighten, more 
people are learning to pay closer attention to drinking water. That attention 
starts with checking the safety of water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
For water that proves to be less than perfect, Better Homes and Gardens 
magazine reports the alternatives are bottled water or a home water treatment 
system. The choice depends on the types and levels of unwelcome elements, taste 
and budget. 
</P>
<P>
Bottled drinking water may offer a quality advantage over tap water. Suppliers 
who are members of the International Bottled Water Assn. voluntarily follow 
stricter standards than those set for public water systems and must also 
undergo unannounced plant inspections. In addition, each state either assigns 
one of its health agencies or allows Food and Drug Administration officials to 
monitor bottlers. 
</P>
<P>
Another difference in bottled water may be the taste. Even the safest municipal 
and private water supplies can contain substances, such as chlorine, that 
disinfect the water but can affect flavor. Many bottled water suppliers 
disinfect water with an environmentally safe form of ozone, because it leaves 
no aftertaste or odor. 
</P>
<P>
Bottled water may also contain minerals, such as calcium and magnesium, that 
keep it from tasting flat. Others come with no sodium. Several brands contain 
fluoride, which children may need for dental health. 
</P>
<P>
Bottlers may indicate on the label when minerals are added, although they are 
not required to do so by law. Even with the addition of certain minerals, the 
flavor distinctions between brands of bottled water are so subtle one may not 
be able to detect any difference. 
</P>
<P>
Tapping into bottled water is as easy as visiting the supermarket, where the 
water can be purchased in several sizes. Or, there are suppliers who will 
deliver water right to a person's door. In either case, make sure the bottler 
is a member of the IBWA (about 90% of all U.S. bottlers). This organization is 
a trade association and has no federal enforcement powers, but it does require 
its members to test for more than 200 possible contaminants (public supplies 
test for fewer than 100). If there isn't an indication of membership, ask the 
bottler.

ROOM TOO DARK AND DREARY? THE SOLUTION MAY LIE OVERHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
SKYLIGHTS: A HOLE IN THE ROOF CAN PROVIDE A SENSE OF OPENNESS AND LIGHT TO LIFT 
THE SPIRITS. INSTALLATION CAN BE RELATIVELY PAINLESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Home Design. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul and Marta Sheffield were so sure about what they wanted in a house they 
could sum it up in three word: openness and light. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started house-hunting a year and a half ago, we told the realtor we 
only wanted to see houses with cathedral ceilings," Paul says. 
</P>
<P>
When she first walked into the house they eventually bought in Huntington 
Beach, Marta was so discouraged she wanted to turn around and walk right back 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a huge, open cathedral ceiling in the living room, "It was so dark 
you couldn't believe it," Marta says. 
</P>
<P>
"But it had so much potential," Paul says. 
</P>
<P>
The house was right in every other way, so they bought it, moved in, and 
ordered skylights for that dark living room. 
</P>
<P>
"When the installers opened up the roof, the sun came pouring in, and it was 
just like walking into heaven," Paul says. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheffields chose two skylights in the most popular size, 2 by 4 feet, made 
of opaque white acrylic, which maximizes the light while protecting carpets, 
curtains and furniture from the fading that direct sunlight can cause. 
</P>
<P>
"The living room now behaves as an atrium during the day," Paul says. 
</P>
<P>
"The light is so uplifting. It changes your whole emotions," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Marta says she appreciates the skylights most when she gets up in the morning. 
"I leave the house every day by 5:30 in the morning. Now when I walk through 
the living room, I can see light. It doesn't seem quite so early. And it's 
still light when I come home too. 
</P>
<P>
"Darkness really depresses both of us," says Marta. 
</P>
<P>
Marta's potted palms have benefited from the increased light too. "They're 
growing like crazy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Skylights are an easy way to make a change in the way a house feels," says 
Judy Weston of Skylights by Weston in Fountain Valley, installers of the 
Sheffields' skylights. 
</P>
<P>
And Paul says the installation was relatively painless. "It only took a day." 
</P>
<P>
One reason it went so quickly, Weston says, is that cathedral ceiling 
installations are the simplest and least expensive. If there is an attic, a 
light shaft must be constructed as well. And in some cases, electrical and heat 
connections must be rerouted, which also adds to the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Roof type is also a factor, Weston says. Composition roofs are the easiest to 
cut into, while wood shake and concrete tile roof make the job somewhat more 
difficult. But skylights can be installed in any kind of roof. 
</P>
<P>
Fixed skylights are less expensive than openable panels, and glass costs 
slightly less than acrylic, according to Dan Gomes of Bristolite Skylights in 
Santa Ana, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of skylights. 
</P>
<P>
Because each installation is different, costs vary, but Weston says a 2-by-4 
skylight could range anywhere from $600 to $1,800. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from cost, Weston says the most common question she hears is, "Will it 
leak?" 
</P>
<P>
"And I say, yes, it will if it's not installed properly. During the winter, we 
get calls all the time from people who had skylights installed by 
handyman-types or who did it themselves. We spend a lot of time repairing other 
people's leaks," she says. 
</P>
<P>
With skylights, as with other home improvements, it's important to make sure 
you're dealing with a licensed, bonded contractor. "Ask for references. Ask if 
they carry liability insurance," says Cherie Patch, also of Skylights by 
Weston. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to install a skylight yourself, Gomes says. Bristolite sells to 
individual homeowners as well as professional installers, and also provides 
installation instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he says, too many people follow the wrong sequence. "A lot of 
people go ahead and cut the opening in the roof and then hope it's a standard 
size." If it isn't, they need a custom skylight, which costs more, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The best application for the do-it-yourselfer is a self-flashing unit on a 
composite roof," Gomes says. "You peel the roofing back, place the skylight on 
the actual tongue-in-groove or plywood, put the roofing material back over it 
and apply sealants." The other most common installation, a curb mount with a 
frame supporting the skylight, is most often used on tile or wood shake roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Before you decide what type of skylight to install, Gomes and Weston recommend 
thinking about how much light you want to let in. Opaque white, such as what 
the Sheffields chose, transmits more light than a clear skylight, while bronze 
or gray tinted skylights let in a more subdued light. Bristolite offers three 
different whites, with different levels of opacity. White skylights also block 
ultraviolet light, which can attack drapes, carpets or whatever is below. 
</P>
<P>
Ultraviolet blocking was another reason the Sheffields chose white skylights. 
They wanted more light on the paintings in their living room, but they didn't 
want to risk damaging them. 
</P>
<P>
"The actual objective can differ," Gomes says. "Think about whether you're 
trying to access light or see out of the skylight." 
</P>
<P>
Patch chose a bronze skylight for her bedroom, which lets in muted light during 
the day but allows her to see the stars on clear nights. 
</P>
<P>
Glass skylights are becoming more popular, Gomes says. "Architects are 
specifying glass more and more," he says. "It costs less because of the amount 
of labor involved in manufacturing the unit, and it's easier to keep clean." It 
is less sensitive to scratching than acrylic, and can be tinted any color. 
</P>
<P>
Another choice that is becoming more popular is the roof window, which fits 
closer to the roof and is installed between the rafters rather than above them. 
"They've been used more on the East Coast, and have just been introduced here," 
Gomes says. "Aesthetically, roof windows are better looking. They have a low 
profile." 
</P>
<P>
Even a small skylight can make a big difference, Weston says. "Since we started 
in 1977, we've installed skylights just about everywhere. Some people want them 
in closets. We've put little 2 by 2 skylights in small bathrooms in (Seal 
Beach) Leisure World. They were just like caves before we put in the lights." 
</P>
<P>
Skylights do have some disadvantages. If they are fixed and uninsulated, they 
can bring up indoor temperatures on a warm day. And on a bright day, there can 
sometimes be too much light. "We were watching the World Cup soccer matches and 
I was teasing my wife that we needed sun visors to block the glare," Paul 
Sheffield says. "But it really isn't a problem. We can just use the TV in the 
bedroom if we want to watch during the day." 
</P>
<P>
Sunlight shades can help with both glare and heat problems, Weston says. "We 
thought about getting shades," says Paul, "But for now, we just want to let in 
as much light as possible."

ACTOR GOES FROM RINGMASTER TO 'BARNUM' MUSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Our guess is that you would buy a used car from this man. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I'm a hustler all right," admits Kristopher Antekeier, currently playing 
the lead in "Barnum," a musical based on the life of P. T. Barnum, at Anaheim's 
Grand Dinner Theatre through Sept. 2. "I could sell anything. An actor is a 
salesman. You walk into an audition, you open your suitcase and say, 'Are you 
buying today?' There's no feeling of rejection for me in auditions -- they're 
either buying or they're not." 
</P>
<P>
They were certainly buying in 1985, when the producers of Ringling Brothers and 
Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus picked Antekeier (that's An-te-kire), then 27, to be 
the youngest ringmaster in the history of "The Greatest Show on Earth." E. P. 
Dutton, the book-publishing company, bit when Antekeier offered to write a 
behind-the-scenes look at the circus after his year in the center ring. And all 
this experience was a great selling point when he auditioned for "Barnum." 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't want to be pigeonholed as a ringmaster, you know?" says the tall, 
affable Antekeier, who describes himself as "larger than life." "I don't walk 
around like this" -- he affects a smooth baritone -- " 'Ladeez and gentlemen, 
children of all ages. . . .' I'm a character actor." 
</P>
<P>
A character actor, it seems, with a sense of adventure. Antekeier went out for 
the circus job after reading an ad in Backstage, the New York trade paper for 
actors. "I do a lot of Plimptonesque things in show business. I love that I did 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"But there wasn't anything romantic about it," he says. "You only read and see 
the fantasy end of it. You never get to see reality." 
</P>
<P>
In his role as P. T. Barnum, there are moments that are "very real," Antekeier 
says. And those truly curious about what it's like to run away with the circus 
can pick up his autobiography / expose, "Ringmaster!" 
</P>
<P>
It's on sale in the lobby, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barnum" continues through Sept. 2 at the Grand Dinner Theatre, 1 Hotel Way, 
Anaheim. Seating times: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 6 p.m.; Fridays, 6:30 p.m.; 
Saturdays, 11:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.; Sundays, 11:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. 
Admission: $25 to $42, includes meal. Information: (714) 772-7710.

ART AND SURVIVAL: THE TRIALS OF DAVID WOJNAROWICZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artist David Wojnarowicz can scarcely keep from cracking a smile at the memory. 
Days before the start of a court hearing last month in a lawsuit he brought 
against a right-wing group headed by the Rev. Donald Wildmon, Wojnarowicz 
caught himself in a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Counting down the days before his appearance at the U.S. District Court in New 
York City, Wojnarowicz said, he let his imagination get the better of him: "I 
saw myself, when I saw Wildmon walking up to the witness stand. Despite all the 
work and preparation (for the case), I thought it would be so great if I could 
leap over the railing and start strangling the guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd definitely lose. Everything would be thrown out the window. But it would 
be such a hilarious moment in time." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Wojnarowicz and Wildmon both testified without incident -- 
calmly and as dispassionately as they could in a lawsuit bearing on 
homosexuality, fundamentalist Christianity and art, and the ways that their 
combination could conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Not inconsequentially, Wojnarowicz won an injunction against Wildmon's 
Mississippi-based American Family Assn. barring further use of a mailing that 
relied on unacknowledged, drastically cropped reproductions of Wojnarowicz's 
images. A final ruling is expected in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Wojnarowicz (pronounced "wahn-uh-ROW-vich") recalled his courtroom fantasy a 
few days ago on the sun deck of a friend's apartment near Venice Beach. He had 
flown in just three hours earlier and -- predictably for someone with AIDS -- 
the trip took a great deal out of him. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't just been the political controversy on top of the illness that has 
drained him, or even so many friends dying in the epidemic. (Wojnarowicz is so 
fatalistic that he jokes about still smoking because every friend who quit and 
otherwise cleaned up his life has contracted the disease and died within months 
after doing so.) 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said, it's the constant strain of events -- from AIDS and the 
National Endowment for the Arts crisis to such disruptions as a hostile note 
from his landlord, slipped under his East Village door two days before he flew 
here. It notified him that he would have to clear out of his apartment for two 
months for "renovations" that the artist suspects are related to a dispute 
between tenants and the building's owner. 
</P>
<P>
He had come for the opening of his show, "Tongues of Flame," at the Santa 
Monica Museum of Art. The exhibit runs through Sept. 5, and is part of the Los 
Angeles Festival. It is the same show that appeared at Illinois State 
University in Normal, Ill., this year, attracting the attention of right-wing 
congressmen and Rev. Wildmon. It was Wojnarowicz's second foray into the NEA 
controversy. The show includes a variety of photographic images and paintings 
that involve explicit sexual -- particularly homosexual -- themes. 
</P>
<P>
In November, it was other images and a catalogue essay by Wojnarowicz that 
figured in the blowup that ensued when NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer canceled 
a $10,000 grant to Artists Space, the New York gallery that proposed to show 
the work in an exhibit called "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing," which focused 
on the AIDS epidemic. The furor ultimately forced Frohnmayer to restore the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with his proclivity for playing artiste provocateur, Wojnarowicz had 
described -- in the NEA-funded catalogue -- New York Roman Catholic Cardinal 
John O'Connor as a "fat cannibal" and detailed a fantasy in which Wojnarowicz 
dreamed of throwing California Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) off the 
Empire State Building. Frohnmayer's actions didn't surprise him, Wojnarowicz 
said, "because I couldn't foresee any of these people having the guts to back 
freedom of expression as it pertains to work like mine. 
</P>
<P>
"Whole elections are won on absolutely nothing. (Honest politicians') fears of 
their opponents' 30-second commercials are real. That's the state of the 
country. It's enraging that these people can't deal in any way with reality in 
a way I can respect." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the sun in Venice, however, Wojnarowicz, 35, recalled that -- with 
the greatest irony, as things have turned out in his life -- as a child, he 
constantly fantasized about invisibility. He describes it as a self-image of a 
ray gun in which he could zap his enemies -- real and imagined -- but never 
himself be seen. 
</P>
<P>
As he sat and dispassionately described growing up, it was difficult to 
understand how Wojnarowicz ever survived his childhood. One of three children 
of a mentally disturbed merchant seaman, Wojnarowicz grew up in New Jersey, but 
when his parents divorced when he was 8, the father -- denied custody -- 
kidnaped the three youngsters and spirited them to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
In Michigan, Wojnarowicz recalls years of basement beatings -- with chains and 
two-by-fours -- and constant shuttling between relatives who grudgingly cared 
for the children during their father's frequent absences. The paternal 
relationship was so bad, Wojnarowicz has consciously tried to free his memory 
of the year his father finally committed suicide -- he thinks he was 20 or 21 
at the time, but isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
Back eventually in New York and living at least nominally with his mother in 
Hell's Kitchen, Wojnarowicz led the double life of a High School of Music and 
Art student by day and male prostitute by night. "I'd run away for a week or 
two, or sometimes an entire summer," he said. "But even when I was on the 
streets, I continued drawing, even if it was a ballpoint pen on a piece of 
cardboard. I'd do this staying up all night in West Side restaurants, hanging 
out with gangs of street people, hustlers and transvestites." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he talked his way into a residential arrangement with a prison 
halfway house, later working as a janitor before finally finding a way to both 
express himself and make a living through art. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I've always done and always gotten flak for," he said of the 
deliberately provocative nature of much of his art -- not just the sexually 
charged material, but a larger body of work that is generally political 
broadside. "It was the only way I could make it through the world. 
</P>
<P>
"In all those years since then, I've slowly stripped away the defenses, trying 
to deal with things openly. There is absolutely no reason the human body should 
be taboo. To separate politics from anything that happens in this country is 
absolutely impossible." 
</P>
<P>
And so Wojnarowicz continues to fight, despite AIDS and the constant drain of 
political events. It is a determination that left him impassive during the 
hearing on the injunction against Wildmon while a witness called by 
Wojnarowicz's lawyers testified that the episode of the cropped images was 
especially damaging to Wojnarowicz's career. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Wojnarowicz, as we all know, has AIDS," the witness said, "and I don't 
think he's got the same kind of time to apply to building his career as an 
artist." 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I'm dealing with all the time," Wojnarowicz said. "It's weird. 
It's strange to watch that (issue) be made use of in terms of the court stuff 
and yet it's part of what I'm dealing with. 
</P>
<P>
"I abstract death, just like everybody else does, if I'm going to keep working 
and keep moving. There are moments that I'm terrified. I have very mixed 
feelings in terms of what I've been seeing in the world that I've lived in. It 
gets very surreal."

<P>
Brian Ballard believes there is a formula for success in trap shooting: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 90% visual skill -- the "instinctive" ability to point. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 8% technique. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 2% luck. 
</P>
<P>
He said 98% should come easily for him at the 45th World Shooting Championships 
in Moscow, U.S.S.R., next month. "Realistically, if I can go in there and have 
that 2% luck for three days, I'll come back with a medal," Ballard said. 
</P>
<P>
Luck is important in a sport in which the 4 1/4-inch width of a single flying 
clay targetcan be the distance between top honors and middle of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Only three targets were the difference between the 1988 Olympic gold medalist, 
who hit 195 of 200, and Ballard, who placed 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard, 29, began developing shooting skill and technique at age 8, when his 
father in Cul-de-sac, Ida., taught him how to use a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard began competing at 10, and after he graduated from Lewis-Clark College 
in Lewiston, Ida., the Army gave him the opportunity to work full time on 
refining his shooting skills with the Marksmanship Unit at Ft. Benning, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed with the Marksmanship Unit -- the one responsible for training most 
world-class American shooters -- for seven years, but left to avoid serving 
overseas as an infantry staff sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
His reputation as a trap shooter got him another job offer -- this time to 
manage the Coto Valley Country Club Hunt Lodge in Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard believes just about anyone can develop some skill as a trap shooter. 
</P>
<P>
"I can take anybody who has decent eyesight and decent hand-eye coordination 
and make them into a recreational trap shooter." he said. The "mental game" 
required of a world-class shooter, however, is a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard's mental game has improved in recent years. He went into the last 
25-target round of the '84 Olympic trials needing to hit 23 to make the team. 
He hit 22. "Looking back on it, I was scared," he said. "I just choked." 
</P>
<P>
But at the '88 trials, where Ballard found himself in a similar situation, he 
was ready. "I remember I had a smile on my face when I walked out on the field 
for the last round," he said. "I had been in that situation before and I knew I 
could deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Ballard also finished second at the national championship in 1988, has shot on 
five U.S. national teams and is the current California state champion. 
</P>
<P>
Though he has made a livelihood of standing up to the pressure of competitive 
trap shooting, Ballard said he is more comfortable hunting dove or giving 
lessons at the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
He said the ranges he competes at are "like my office." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not all fun," Ballard said of the four months each year he spends 
traveling to and participating in trap-shooting tournaments. "It is (fun, 
sometimes) or I wouldn't be in it. But it's my job. . . . It's something I want 
to excel in like anyone wants to excel at their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the competitiveness in me that keeps me doing it. It keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
The National Rifle Assn. is one of the governing bodies for U.S. trap shooting 
and often uses competitive events to raise money to support political lobbying 
against gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Just by telling people what he does for a living, Ballard is often forced into 
discussions he sometimes finds tiresome. "Of course I'm pro-gun," he said. "I'm 
not into the politics that much. . . . Again, I'm just a competitor. I don't 
think the politics should be involved in it. . . . I'm just a guy trying to 
have some fun." 
</P>
<P>
Off the shooting range, Ballard can let go of his competitive edge. "When I'm 
hunting with my friends, if I miss a shot, I'll get ribbed a lot," he said. 
"But I'll laugh right along with them."

ED EMSHWILLER, 65; ARTIST, CALARTS DEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Emshwiller, an abstract Expressionist and video artist who was dean of the 
California Institute of the Arts' School of Film and Video, died Friday. He was 
65. 
</P>
<P>
Emshwiller, who signed his paintings and award-winning science fiction 
illustrations "EMSH," died of cancer at the Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed Emshwiller was a wonderful man and an exceptional artist," college 
President Steven D. Lavine said. "As much as any one person, he embodied the 
spirit of CalArts. This is a tremendous loss for us all." 
</P>
<P>
The versatile artist and administrator studied art at the University of 
Michigan, the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and at the 
Art Students League. He became dean of the CalArts film school in 1979 and 
served as provost from 1981 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Praising Emshwiller's "extraordinary gifts" as an artist, former CalArts 
President Robert J. Fitzpatrick once commented: "To his own surprise and our 
great benefit, he has shown a special talent for administration and leadership. 
. . . He is the only person I know who could successfully combine triple 
careers of artist, dean and provost." 
</P>
<P>
Always trying to extend the limits of film and video, Emshwiller at the time of 
his death was working with composer Morton Subotnick in what he called 
"interactive and three-dimensional performance with sound/image generation and 
various controlling devices." 
</P>
<P>
The new work was to create changeable images in the same way that the two men 
had created constantly changing sound in the electronic video opera called 
"Hungers," which they created for the 1987 Los Angeles Arts Festival. "Hungers" 
employed live performance and interactive devices that changed the sound of the 
music according to the environment, so that no two performances were ever the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
To Emshwiller, the innovative technique was merely a way "to get film out of 
its can." 
</P>
<P>
A pilot for the last three years, Emshwiller was also planning a video project 
that involved mixing airplane-view images of the Mojave Desert with computer 
graphics and a voice-over. 
</P>
<P>
Emshwiller's experimental films, including "Relativity," "Totem," "Three 
Dancers" and "Thanatopsis," have been screened at film festivals in New York, 
London, Berlin, Edinburgh and Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
His multimedia productions were exhibited at Lincoln Center, the Museum of 
Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York, as well as at the Los Angeles 
Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Emshwiller won grants for his work from the NEA, the Rockefeller, Ford and 
Guggenheim foundations and the Corp. for Public Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
He served on boards of the American Film Institute, the Filmmakers Cooperative, 
the Assn. of Independent Video and Filmmakers and the Independent Television 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Carol, three children, Eve, Susan and Peter, and a 
brother, Maclellan. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled for 7 p.m. Sunday in the Graduation Courtyard 
of the CalArts campus in Valencia.
