Savings from the sale of the Episcopal cathedral in downtown Los Angeles 10 
years ago have nearly doubled to $9.2 million, indicating that a new cathedral 
"is an increasingly valid option" to consider, says the newspaper for the 
six-county Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
However, said Bishop Frederick H. Borsch, "this is not the time to make the 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Borsch recently told church officials that the decision last year to build a 
new diocesan headquarters and parish-size church on a site overlooking Echo 
Park takes precedence in diocesan plans. The present headquarters property was 
sold a week before Borsch was elected bishop in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We must have a place for our offices. . . . We can wait on a decision about a 
cathedral," Borsch told the Episcopal News, the diocesan paper. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he was not against the idea of designating an existing parish 
church as the cathedral, Borsch indicated that none is now large enough to seat 
a representative portion of the diocese. Because of increasing property and 
building costs, he added, "the whole diocese really needs to be a party to the 
decision" on whether to construct a new edifice. 
</P>
<P>
The site of the old St. Paul's Cathedral, which was fated for demolition a 
decade ago because it did not meet city earthquake codes, was sold for $4.7 
million. The diocese's Cathedral Corp. put that sum in a trust for a future 
cathedral. Meanwhile, part of the interest earned has gone into an ongoing 
grants program benefiting church projects from Lompoc to Laguna Beach to 
Needles. Of $3.2 million disbursed to date, one-third has gone to ministries 
categorized as urban ($982,000), Latino ($462,000), Asian ($312,000), youth 
($133,000), justice issues ($59,000) and AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, ($59,000). 
</P>

PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Carol L. Anderson, a priest prominent in national Episcopal Church 
matters, has been elected rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in Beverly 
Hills -- the first woman to become pastor of a major parish in the Los Angeles 
diocese. The Beverly Hills parish has more than 2,300 baptized members, second 
in size only to All Saints Church in Pasadena. She will succeed the Rev. M. 
Gregory Richards in September. Anderson, 44, most recently founder-director of 
the Institute for Clergy Renewal in Fairfax, Va., has served two New York City 
parishes, was a delegate to three national conventions and is on the 
denomination's boards for evangelism and theological education. She is only the 
second clergywoman to be named a rector in the diocese; the first was the Rev. 
Carole Herzog at St. Stephen's in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. John Killinger, senior minister at the imposing First Congregational 
Church of Los Angeles since September, 1986, has resigned that post to become 
distinguished professor of religion and culture at Samford University in 
Birmingham, Ala. Killinger, who taught at Vanderbilt Divinity School for 15 
years, will assume his new position at the Southern Baptist-related school in 
late summer. Killinger was pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Lynchburg, 
Va., for six years before moving to Los Angeles. He was a founding member of 
both Project Literacy Los Angeles and Hope-Net Inc., a multichurch agency to 
combat hunger and homelessness in the Wilshire District.

Mazon, the nationwide Jewish anti-hunger organization based in Los Angeles, 
announced that it has allocated $700,000 this year to nonprofit groups. Grants 
from Mazon have steadily risen since its founding four years ago. Its income 
comes primarily from Jewish families who agree to donate 3% of the cost of 
their "joyous occasions" -- weddings, bar and bat mitzvahs and other events. 
Among the grants made this year were $12,000 to El Rescate in Los Angeles, 
$7,500 to Harbor Interfaith Shelter in San Pedro and $4,000 to the 
South-Central Family Health Center in Los Angeles.

As many as 6,000 Filipino-American members of the Church of Christ, known as 
Iglesia Ni Cristo in the Philippines, are expected to see and hear their 
Manila-based spiritual leader, the Rev. Erano Manalo, via satellite television 
today in a church celebration at Aviation Park Auditorium in Manhattan Beach. 
The 75-year-old denomination, which began establishing U.S. churches in 1968, 
has 14 congregations in Southern California with nearly 10,000 members, 
according to a spokesman, the Rev. Teody Samson. JOHN DART

RESONANCE IN THE BALTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In moves so harmonic they seemed orchestrated, the Soviet government admitted 
Thursday that the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were 
illegally stripped of their sovereignty in 1939, and the Soviet Parliament 
decided to give some of it back. These developments promise a brighter future 
for these republics, the Soviet Union as a whole and for U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1939, dictators Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler made an agreement that 
essentially gave a green light to the Soviet Union's forced annexation of the 
independent countries the following year. The Soviets have consistently denied 
the very existence of the protocols, insisting that "progressive forces" within 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania asked that their republics be incorporated into 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This falsification of history has 
vexed Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians ever since. Fifty years later, the 
record has finally been set straight. 
</P>
<P>
But this was a historical vexation, not a contemporary one, so it is entirely 
fitting that the Soviet Parliament responded to a current grievance at the same 
time, giving preliminary approval to Estonian and Lithuanian economic autonomy. 
The Baltic republics, by far the most prosperous of the Soviet Union's regions, 
have long felt that their economic know-how was being exploited by 
less-prosperous regions. They have been forced to conform to economic dictates 
from Moscow, often at the expense of their local interests. The proposals for 
economic autonomy, which still need to be worked out in detail, will both 
harness the full economic potential of the the region and grant the republics a 
measure of control over their own affairs that is historically justified and 
long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
Economic autonomy for the republics will benefit the Soviet Union as a whole. 
Leonid I. Abalkin, a Soviet deputy prime minister, told the Supreme Soviet 
Thursday that autonomy should be introduced in the Baltic republics as an 
initial step toward achieving an entirely new, decentralized system of economic 
management for the entire country, a system that should be far more efficient 
and responsive than the Moscow-dictated production quotas currently in place. 
Finally, the moves are beneficial to the United States, soothing old 
irritations in U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, in a pattern that would be monotonous if it were not exhilarating, 
Gorbachev has taken a revolutionary step in his campaign of liberalization, one 
that was inconceivable just a few months ago. Rarely do historical wrongs and 
contemporary rights converge with such resonance.

LIKUD PARTY'S PEACE PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been quite the spectacle. Nothing to match the chariot race in "Ben 
Hur," to be sure, but it is not every day -- as it was in the aftermath of the 
decidedly internal wrangling within Israel's Likud party over the terms of the 
peace process Israel launched two months ago -- that ostensibly seasoned 
political observers the world over greet purely internal posturings within a 
political party with the aplomb of men about to have their thumbnails snatched 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Within Israel, of course, the resolutions passed by the Likud caused some 
concern, most of it now obviously premature, regarding its readiness to adhere 
to the terms of its coalition agreement with the Labor alignment. Some even 
sensed in Likud's pronunciamentos the impending death-knell of the Israeli 
initiative and, consequently, of the national unity government. Others, fueled 
largely by an inherent malice toward the Jewish state, went so far as to insist 
that the terrorist commandering and subsequent wrecking of an Israeli civilian 
bus on the Tel Aviv/Jerusalem highway, which resulted in scores of civilian 
dead and wounded, was directly attributable (this despite the fact that this 
act of terror turned out to have long been in the planning) to the Likud's 
alleged reneging on its initially publicized terms. 
</P>
<P>
This, anyway, was the contention of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, his aides Abu 
Iyad and Abu Sharif, and some lamentably prominent American political 
cartoonists and editorialists, all of whom have been understandably loath to 
point out that the peace plan the Likud had allegedly "torpedoed" was one that 
neither the PLO nor a single Palestinian Arab leader welcomed for a minute to 
begin with. 
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter, however, is that despite the appearance of backtracking 
by the Likud, that party's resolutions merely formalized positions which are 
not -- not for a moment -- binding on the government of which it is a part. 
Indeed, it has been widely recognized that significant differences do exist 
between Labor and the Likud with respect to a number of issues related to the 
peace process, as well they might given the democratic nature of the state of 
Israel and the challenges it faces to its existence. The critical point, 
however, is not the position adopted by a single party or individual leaders, 
but, rather, the policies that formally have been agreed upon by the Israeli 
government. In that sense, the four-point Israeli initiative has not been 
abrogated or amended and continues to be the policy of Israel until such time 
as the government acts to change it or dissolve itself. 
</P>
<P>
And at this juncture -- and both Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Israeli 
foreign minister Moshe Arens have conveyed this to the Bush Administration and 
the State Department -- the only binding position on the government of Israel 
remains the proposal adopted by it on May 14, and subsequently presented to the 
United States by the premier himself. This was, in fact, understood by the 
State Department after some initial misgivings, and recently, Richard Boucher, 
its spokesman, reiterated that the United States regards the Shamir plan as the 
most promising route to a just solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, and 
called upon the Palestinians to accept the election proposal and to "enter into 
a dialogue with the Israelis to flesh out the details of the initiative, and to 
make elections and negotiations work." 
</P>
<P>
Israel stands unswerving in its readiness to pursue a dialogue with the 
Palestinian people and the warring Arab states of the Middle East based upon 
free and democratic elections for the occupants of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza 
district in an atmosphere devoid of violence, threats and terror. 
</P>
<P>
It stands ready, as it did when it signed the Camp David Accords with Egypt and 
the United States in 1978, to end the state of war between itself and its 
neighbors, and to participate in an international effort to resolve the Arab 
refugee problem. It is prepared to negotiate over the fate of the territories 
under its control since it was attacked in 1967 without preconditions. 
</P>
<P>
If the Palestinians remain convinced that this is a ploy -- that Israel is, as 
they have argued, eminently comfortable with the prospects of a Palestinian 
rejection of these terms -- they really ought to put the Jewish state to the 
test and agree to the Israeli initiative in its original form. If they do not, 
the train they derail this time may well be their own. A shame, really -- 
they've missed so many of them before.

REBECCA SCHAEFFER'S MURDER: THINGS THAT WENT WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One might say actress Rebecca Schaeffer's life was worth only about $5, as that 
is all the money it took to legally obtain her home address from the California 
Department of Motor Vehicles, with the issuance of such directly leading to her 
death (Part I, July 22). 
</P>
<P>
Accused murderer Robert John Bardo then allegedly used this address, which was 
obtained by a private investigator hired by him, though anyone could easily 
obtain it from the DMV with a valid reason, to hunt her down and kill her. 
</P>
<P>
It is painfully self-evident that new laws need to be immediately enacted to 
protect the privacy and safety of individuals by making it considerably more 
difficult for someone to obtain a person's home address from the DMV or any 
other source in order to prevent future such tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
Another disturbing aspect of this murder is that due to severe cutbacks in 
mental health funding, individuals like Bardo, who are seriously disturbed and 
need to be confined in mental institutions, are out there freely roaming the 
streets, veritable walking time bombs, just waiting to explode and kill or 
seriously injure someone.

REBECCA SCHAEFFER'S MURDER: THINGS THAT WENT WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lonely man worships and adores a beautiful, distant woman. She's the only 
brightness in his life. Then, one day he shoots her. We react in disbelief. Who 
can fathom such behavior? Who can explain it? Finally, we content ourselves 
with a resigned "there is no explaining it." 
</P>
<P>
But of course that's nonsense. The behavior is entirely fathomable, it's easy 
to explain. It's the behavior of a jealous child who takes his friend's new toy 
and breaks it -- it's "If I can't have it, no one else will." It's selfishness, 
only selfishness taken to the most awful level. 
</P>
<P>
What is unfathomable is our part in this. We let it get to that awful level. We 
provide the gun. 
</P>
<P>
Year after year America puts guns in the hands of sick men who are no better 
equipped to manage them than those jealous children would be. Then we react in 
disbelief when tragedy results. We make it easy to get guns and we make it easy 
to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Gun control makes it harder. America still can't understand that. That's the 
only thing there truly is no explaining.

THE SAT TEST FAILS TO MEASURE FAIRLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Crash Course," The Times misrepresents the basic message of the Princeton 
Review. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone talks about the SAT, but rarely does anyone actually look at it. We 
prepare over 25,000 students a year for the SAT; we know this test intimately. 
As far as we can tell, it neither predicts college grades nor measures anything 
of importance. 
</P>
<P>
Its biases (60 points against women, 110 points against blacks) make it even 
less useful. Of white men, 1% don't reach the NCAA's SAT cutoff; of black 
women, 50% don't reach it. 
</P>
<P>
Students miss questions on the SAT for two reasons: The lack some basic math 
and reading skills, or the idiom of the test itself makes it difficult for them 
to show their ability. We feel that the quality of an exam depends on how 
little testmanship it requires. 
</P>
<P>
The SAT, a relic of a time when every college student was a white, 
upper-middle-class man, requires much more than most students learn in school. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to find a new test, one that's not biased, that promotes real 
educational values, and that correlates to college performance. Until the NCAA 
uses that test, we will continue to lift students over the arbitrary hurdle of 
the SAT better than anyone else (as The Times reported, our results are 
unquestioned.) Reebok should be congratulated for helping athletes over this 
hurdle, and for helping create a better test.

Those of us connected with the USC football program are disappointed with the 
comments of Bob Belyeu, general manager of the Shrine All-Star game, which 
appeared in The Times July 22. 
</P>
<P>
Belyeu said he was upset with the way USC handled the situation, claiming that 
"USC just ignored us, like the game means nothing. They did not even show the 
courtesy to contact us; no phone call or anything." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Trojan Coach Larry Smith has always encouraged recruits to play in 
all-star games. However, Smith was not contacted about the Shrine game date or 
practice schedule until about a month ago, when Belyeu called to alert him of 
the conflict. Although Smith was on vacation, he called Belyeu back that day 
and offered to put him in touch with the bridge program's administrator to see 
if something could be worked out. Belyeu declined this offer.

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MURRAY NOT FOUND IN THIS GOOD BOOKIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gee, the pulpit's still warm. Jim Murray must have just left. 
</P>
<P>
Why not throw a few bucks Oregon's way? Because of some long-ago ignored edict? 
Do we, the people, bury our heads in the sand and wish away gambling? 
</P>
<P>
I have a cousin who happens to be a Catholic priest. Each year, he and I wager 
on who will finish higher in the standings, the Angels or Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Is he a sinner now, morally inept? Does Father Murray proclaim himself more 
righteous than my cousin? 
</P>
<P>
My point is, gambling is a victim-less "crime." There are quite a few of us who 
are able to function every day and keep betting in its place. 
</P>
<P>
Why should Oregonians gamble and see their monetary losses driven out of the 
state to Nevada. This way, it all stays home and the losses help the state 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
I excuse the vicar of The Times for calling me a low life.

ONE PITCH WASN'T WORTH MOORE'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donnie Moore's tragic shooting of himself and his wife seemed to stem from his 
pitching career -- actually, the negative side of his career. 
</P>
<P>
The fans should not have booed for the over-dramatized home run by Dave 
Henderson. Moore threw with a sore arm. He would not have been in that 
situation if: 
</P>
<P>
1. Gary Lucas had not hit Rich Gedman with one pitch. 
</P>
<P>
2. Mike Witt had not given up a home run to Don Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
3. The Angels had scored more runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels still could have won the game in the bottom half of the inning with 
the bases loaded and one out. Moore should have been rewarded for his service 
with the Angels. His only reward was a new contract, which was the focus of 
Mike Port's criticism of Moore's performance later.

By STEVE HARVEY, From staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest, and perhaps most subtle, commentary on the gridlock wars of 
Southern California is a Los Angeles City-issue "2-Hour Parking" sign that 
someone has replanted -- along the eastbound on-ramp of the Santa Monica 
Freeway at Centinela Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there's a revenue-raising idea here. 
</P>
<P>
As the morning jam-up worsens behind the metered on-ramps, the city could take 
the prankster one step further and install parking meters in the lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than complaining about the traffic, Brian Roberts and Richard Schwadel 
scheme to avoid all 504 miles of freeway in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
They've compiled their tips into "L.A. Shortcuts," a $14.95 compendium of zigs, 
zags, dots, dashes, loops, jogs, dog-legs, detours and occasional bursts 
through mini-mart parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Their 90 secret routes feature such forgotten alternates as Alameda Boulevard 
(instead of the Harbor Freeway), La Cienega Boulevard (as an access route to 
Los Angeles International Airport from the north), and the old Franklin 
Avenue-Serrano Avenue-Los Feliz Boulevard-Glendale Avenue route from Hollywood 
to Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The authors also offer such general tips as "if it's wide enough, drive it" 
(alleys, driveways, parking lots, etc.), "don't mess with the pros" (truck and 
bus drivers use company-owned vehicles, they point out) and "respect the 
locals" in residential areas or you may be ambushed with rotten leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, when Vincent Rogers visited his son, Michael, a Hollywood 
musician, the elder Rogers was amused to see that Michael had purchased a 1948 
Packard. 
</P>
<P>
"Can't you afford a new car?" the father needled him. Then he mentioned that 
he'd once owned a 1948 Packard himself. That got them to talking. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Rogers remembered that he'd had some repair work done on the right 
fender. The son's Packard bore similar marks. When Vincent went home, he 
checked his records and found that the engine number on his old Packard (which 
he sold in 1950) matched that of Michael's. 
</P>
<P>
"My Dad has since passed away," Michael Rogers said. "But I'm just glad that I 
had this (accompanying) photo made." 
</P>
<P>
Get me to the slide on time . . .

John Saffelo, 23, and Clara Deets, 20, are scheduled to be married this morning 
in the Bermuda Triangle attraction at the Raging Waters park in San Dimas.

Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) took a female companion to see the film 
"When Harry Met Sally . . ." in Westwood the other day. And what happened? Not 
only does Carrie Fisher make a reference in the movie to Jane Fonda, Hayden's 
estranged wife, but the theater also showed a preview of "Old Gringo," 
featuring actor Jimmy Smits in bed with Fonda.

'PHILOSOPHICAL BAGGAGE' OF EVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest your July 19 story on how the "battle over the teaching of 
evolution" is heating up again. I spend some time on that issue in my course in 
science and modern culture at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Darwin, the creation-evolution issue has been like an underground 
fire that erupts every so often. Could the problem really be that people are 
trying to resolve things by arguing them out within the arena of science 
itself? 
</P>
<P>
When you dig down to the roots, don't you find the philosophical issue of 
whether or not a God somehow superintended whatever processes brought life into 
existence on this planet? What if I won the California lottery, or had an 
amazing recovery from some catastrophic illness, and then asked science to tell 
me whether or not divine providence was involved? Do you really think it could? 
</P>
<P>
The problem with evolution is that, at least in the minds of a great many 
people, it seems to carry so much philosophical baggage along with it. If the 
word "evolution" is taken to embrace a satisfying explanation for the existence 
of all life on this planet, then the philosophical implications are absolutely 
enormous! 
</P>
<P>
I sometimes fantasize of a time when we could simply just stop using the word 
evolution in scientific contexts. We could create other terms with more 
precisely defined scientific meanings. The reason this is unacceptable to so 
many scientists is that they like the philosophical baggage carried by the term 
evolution. Why not find a way to teach just science in the K-12 science 
classroom and leave the philosophical baggage out!

<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' editorial "Evolution Only, Please" (July 21) failed to comprehend 
the educational, scholastic and political issues at hand in Sacramento. Forced 
teaching of creation is not the issue. The Times used a non-issue as a smoke 
screen to twist public opinion and cover up the real issues. 
</P>
<P>
The issues are: 
</P>
<P>
1) The proposed science framework states that evolution is a fact and places 
this as a foundation for the entire work. The state Board of Education twice 
asked for its removal but framework authors have refused to make the changes 
the board has the authority to require. 
</P>
<P>
2) The theory of evolution is presented in a dogmatic way, without applying the 
scientific standards of testing, verifying, modifying and refuting. It thus is 
presented as a "compelling belief," putting it in the category of de facto 
religion, even if it is the religion of secular humanism. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, material should be included in the textbooks that gives students 
information by various credible scientists. Yes, there are scientists who do 
not accept evolution (Michael Denton, a renowned Australian biologist, is one), 
who say that evolution, particularly macro-evolution, cannot be substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
3) In addition, this commission is suppressing the First Amendment rights of 
students and teachers. The Supreme Court in Edwards vs. Aguillard ruled that 
teachers have always had the right under the Constitution to discuss creation 
in their classes. Honig and this commission are trying to remove these rights.

This will by no means be the only response to your editorial. Since evolution 
is only a theory, and cannot be proven, why would teaching the creation theory 
be confusing science with religion," as you say? If God created everything, as 
we "fundamentalists" believe, then true science and the Bible agree totally. If 
you were to study with a biblical science scholar you would realize this. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the evolution theory is taught in the schools, the creation theory 
should be allowed also. After all, if evolution were a fact, it would also be 
God's doing, so you would still be confusing science with religion, would you 
not?

According to Christian orthodoxy, faith is a gift given by grace, by God. That 
which can be proven does not require faith, which is the cornerstone of 
Christianity. One is "saved" by grace -- not by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Fundamentalist Christians indulge in idolatry by demanding that the state 
perform a function which doctrinally belongs only to their God. 
</P>
<P>
If fundamentalist children have their faith torn down "by talking about 
evolution as fact," their parents should address the problem to their God 
rather than to state curriculum commissions.

PAUL LINKE DRAMA ON BIRTH AND DEATH MOVES TO HBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home birth. Home death. Home Box Office. 
</P>
<P>
"Time Flies When You're Alive," Paul Linke's moving monologue about the home 
births of his children and the home death of his wife, arrives on Home Box 
Office Sunday at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Stock up on handkerchiefs. 
</P>
<P>
The piece was nurtured at the Powerhouse and Tiffany theaters, in Santa Monica 
and West Hollywood, and the staged version, directed by Mark C. Travis, was 
indeed a little powerhouse. But it's even more of one now, in Roger 
Spottiswoode's screen version. 
</P>
<P>
The show celebrates the idea of marking life's most important passages, 
surrounded by your loved ones in your own environment. So it's perfectly 
appropriate that people should watch it in their living rooms, surrounded by 
family. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not a trendy tribute to the cocooning of couples and families. Its 
fundamental subjects are elemental. And Linke's presentation is spellbinding. 
</P>
<P>
The screen version opens with an exterior shot of Linke's Mar Vista house. The 
same image is later used as a framed background during the studio-shot 
monologue. But before we see Linke himself, John Bailey's camera (Bailey also 
shot the Spalding Gray monologue "Swimming to Cambodia") moves slowly through 
Linke's house. We see objets d'art and signs of children, but no people. 
Ravel's "Pavane Pour Une Infante Defunte" plays in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the house, we enter a stage on which Linke stands before an audience. 
He welcomes us "to an evening with me," which may strike those who haven't seen 
his show as self-indulgent. Who is this Paul Linke? 
</P>
<P>
As he begins talking, however, it quickly becomes apparent that Linke's story 
is a human interest story in the best possible meaning of the term -- if you're 
human, you'll be interested. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Linke announces that the story ends with the death of his 
wife, Francesca, in 1986. She realized, too late, that the lump in her breast 
was not related to breast-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
But it's also the story of a couple trying to support each other through a 
crisis and occasionally failing, of a woman's aversion to conventional medicine 
and her search for alternative treatments, of children's attempts to comprehend 
the incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
It even includes an amusing side trip back to the 
</P>
<P>
day when Linke bought himself a colonic for his birthday. Throughout, Linke is 
never far from self-deprecating humor. Nor is he ever far from gut-wrenching 
passion. 
</P>
<P>
Although Linke's words never sound arty, his performance is definitely artful. 
He is an actor. This is not a rambling therapy session. Yet the authenticity is 
unmistakable. It helps that the sight of the studio audience disappears after 
the first few minutes, never to return. Although it's only an illusion that 
Linke is speaking to each of us personally, it's an illusion that becomes 
harder to avoid, as the show goes on. 
</P>
<P>
His performance has been expertly choreographed, lit and shot. Sometimes Linke 
speaks quickly, literally commanding "jump cut" as he switches scenes. 
Sometimes he pauses to allow the impact of his words to sink in. When he utters 
the doctor's initial verdict, he is flooded with harsh, intimidating light; the 
birth of his child brings on another kind of glow. 
</P>
<P>
The visual virtuosity (and some trimming of the text) imparts an urgency to the 
performance that surpasses the stage version. 
</P>
<P>

I've found the most obscene TV shows have been produced by the likes of Jim and 
Tammy Faye Bakker, Oral Roberts and Jimmy Swaggart. "Knots Landing" can't even 
compare to the avarice and greed, stories of illicit sex and homosexuality, 
air-conditioned doghouses, fraud, deception, tearful confessions on TV that 
these hypocrites have engaged in. 
</P>
<P>
At least when I watch "Midnight Caller" I know I won't be harangued by someone 
who wants me to send them my money.

RICK CARROLL

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning Claudia Puig's article on Rick Carroll, the radio programmer who 
died this month ("Carroll Brought Luster, Listeners to KROQ-FM," July 14): I 
was a deejay for 17 years, many of those working with or for Rick Carroll. Rick 
was able to instill a feeling of true security and protection, while making you 
feel like the world revolved around you. The feeling he gave you transferred to 
the performance you gave on the air and consequently to positive results in the 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
This ability, combined with his brilliance in music selection and programming, 
made him a genius.

A REDESIGNED MONK BY MAGRUDER'S MONKTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The setting was perfect. The Sculpture Garden of the Long Beach Museum of Art 
has to be one of the most pleasant places to hear jazz on a summer night. With 
the lights of the Queen Mary sparkling in the distance and the setting sun 
glowing through a rainbow of colors . . . who could ask for anything more? 
</P>
<P>
Great. But how was the music, you say? Ah, well, Wednesday night it seemed to 
have possibilities. Composer John Magruder's Monktet was on stage with a 
nine-piece band all primed to play new arrangements of the music of Thelonious 
Monk. Not a particularly new idea, but an interesting one, nonetheless. The 
opening piece, "Well, You Needn't," raised a few questions, however, the most 
obvious of which was, "What would Monk make of this?" Magruder had somehow 
managed to reduce all the disjunct accents and quirky rhythms to the smooth and 
well-rounded dimensions of what was once called "West Coast jazz." 
</P>
<P>
"52nd St. Theme" and "Ruby, My Dear" suffered similar fates. Magruder's 
variations on these classic pieces were extremely well-crafted; the ensemble 
played them with nearly flawless technique. Yet the net results had little to 
do with the music of Monk because they failed to acknowledge the importance of 
melodic shaping in his lines, the significance of his very specific harmonic 
voicings, and the singular way in which he used a single accent or two to make 
a phrase come to life. 
</P>
<P>
On a few of the pieces -- notably "Bemsha Swing" and "Epistrophy" -- Magruder 
was more successful, largely because he stayed with both the interiors as well 
as the exteriors of the Monk pieces. But the Monktet's best outings came on a 
number of Magruder originals. Clearly, his own loose and easy lines provided 
the most appropriate vehicles for Magruder's arranging style. 
</P>
<P>
Of the soloists, only alto saxophonist Ron Singer and, to a somewhat lesser 
extent, pianist Alan Steinberger, seemed to clearly understand the special 
demands of the Monk pieces. Guitarist Mack Dougherty, working quietly in the 
background, constantly found ways to sneak in appropriately dissonant fragments 
of sound. DON HECKMAN

JIMMY AND STACY ROWLES MAKE MUSIC A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jazz fans who can bear the echoing din of Linda's, a loft-like eatery on 
trend-stricken Melrose Avenue, have a special treat in store for them on 
Thursday nights when the father-daughter team of Jimmy and Stacy Rowles hold 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by substitute bassist Larry Gales and joined briefly by the club's owner, 
singer Linda Keegan, the two Rowleses matched wits and chops in a pair of 
too-short sets Thursday evening that were simply divine. 
</P>
<P>
"Birk's Works," a tune by Dizzy Gillespie, got things going in an easily 
swinging tempo that provided an apt backdrop for Stacy's understated 
fluegelhorn. Gales, as he would on a couple of occasions, soloed deftly by bow, 
with the elder Rowles gently accenting the proceedings with his poignant 
glimpses of melody. 
</P>
<P>
"Prelude to a Kiss," from the Ellington songbook, had the pianist working the 
ballad with only bass accompaniment. Though slowly paced, Jimmy implied 
tremendous melodic movement, his uniquely voiced harmonies supplying 
exceptional interest to the tune. 
</P>
<P>
"Local Motif," a tune by bassist Gales, was an oddly rhythmic piece whose muted 
trumpet lines by Stacy lent a '50s Miles Davis feeling. 
</P>
<P>
But the young trumpeter is hardly a clone of Davis or any other figure in jazz. 
She has, in recent years, clearly come into her own. Possessing fine chops and 
extraordinary sensibilities (is it genetic?), she lent spirit, grace and beauty 
to each of her outings. None, however, was better than her reading of "Old 
Folks," a gentle ballad in which daughter and father shone. 
</P>
<P>
On the swing side, her muted trumpet work on "All the Things You Are" was 
lively and inventive. 
</P>
<P>
Thursdays at Linda's are a must for jazz fans. Go early (the sets begin at 8 
p.m.) and sit close to the piano.A. JAMES LISKA

POP BEAT: PIXIES AT THE PALACE: NO LEAP INTO GREATNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Pixies' music were a movie, it would be scripted by William Burroughs 
and directed by David Lynch, with a score by the Velvet Underground. (Still 
photographer: Robert Mapplethorpe.) 
</P>
<P>
As rock 'n' roll, the Boston foursome's ongoing encounter with obsession, dread 
and the struggle of the flesh and the spirit yields an unruly, intriguing clash 
of harsh minimalism and soaring escape. 
</P>
<P>
For a band with so many identifiable antecedents, the Pixies do a remarkable 
job of forging an original vision, and their blend of experimentation and 
accessibility has brought the group to the forefront of the alternative market. 
But at the Palace on Thursday, the Pixies didn't take the leap into greatness 
that seems in their range. 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing slick or compromised about the no-nonsense, no-frills, 
down-to-business performance, but the Pixies threw out the personality with the 
pandering. Remote and reticent, they acted as if contact with the audience or 
flamboyance on stage would somehow cheapen the act. Or maybe they're just shy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of enlarging on their music, they chose to distill and concentrate it 
into a thick, hard attack. The taut but free-swinging sound repeatedly gained 
and lost momentum, and the set was more monochromatic than the current 
"Doolittle" album, which boasts an amazing scope. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Black Francis likes to create deranged characters with his assortment of 
growls, whispers, pants and shrieks, which can get labored and self-conscious. 
Solution: more leads from bassist Kim Deal, whose vocal on the cult hit 
"Gigantic" (winningly pronounced gi-gayan-tic and riding a "Sweet Jane"-like 
riff) was one of the show's high points. RICHARD CROMELIN

POP BEAT: FREDDIE JACKSON AT GREEK: HIP-THRUSTS, GOOD WILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freddie Jackson is a cuddlesome charmer, no doubt, and that's the core of his 
appeal. When those wild vocal notes start flying all over the map -- some of 
them making their destination, some not -- it's easy to start wishing for the 
precision and soul-assured technique of a Luther Vandross. And when Jackson 
starts to dance, thrusting his pelvis hither and yon like a Chippendale's 
dancer who's fallen off the Pritikin diet wagon, well, it's not exactly a 
lust-inducing sight. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday night at the Greek Theatre, Jackson -- resplendent in baby-blue 
sequins and satin -- put on a show that engendered so much good will among his 
audience that it was easy to overlook a few out-of-control notes and overly 
zealous hip thrusts. 
</P>
<P>
When Jackson let a hyperventilating woman in the front row wipe his sweaty brow 
with a towel and then gleefully crowed, "I messed her up!" it didn't sound like 
smug arrogance -- he seemed genuinely awed that he could have that kind of 
effect on someone. 
</P>
<P>
Opening act Vesta Williams is another performer in the give-'em-more-more-more 
mold. Dancing so exuberantly at one point that she busted a bra strap, the 
L.A.-based vocalist was undoubtedly raw. She also could grow into the kind of 
singer mentioned in the same breath as Patti LaBelle and Aretha Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also plays the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim tonight. CONNIE JOHNSON

A LANDSCAPING SHOWROOM AT THE FULLERTON ARBORETUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three predominant impressions came to mind as I completed a recent tour of the 
Fullerton Arboretum, located on the campus of Cal State Fullerton: This is a 
very practical arboretum; it is a historically fascinating place; there is 
something here for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to be a horticultural aficionado to enjoy and benefit from a 
visit. It is a most practical place to observe plants and determine how they 
will fit into your particular home landscape or gardening situation. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, do you want to know how a particular rose will look and perform 
under Southland growing conditions? Visit the Rose Section; chances are the 
rose you are interested in will be there in full bloom, along with many other 
modern roses and a fine collection of old-fashioned ones. 
</P>
<P>
What about growing fruit trees in Southern California? Wander through the 
Subtropical Fruit Grove and check out fruit trees designed for our climate. A 
visit right before harvest time will demonstrate which peach, apple, apricot, 
plum, etc. varieties produce the best. Urban gardeners will be particularly 
interested in the Dwarf Fruit Section, which features a selection of 
space-saving dwarf fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rare Fruit Collection 
</P>
<P>
Within the Subtropical Fruit Grove is a marvelous collection of rare fruit 
trees maintained by the California Rare Fruit Growers, whose headquarters is at 
the arboretum. Exotic cherimoyas, papayas and guavas are just a few of the rare 
fruit varieties growing here, most of which may be suitable for planting in 
your own yard. Incidentally, you can sample some of these rare fruits in season 
by purchasing them at the arboretum gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
Xeriscaping (landscaping with drought-tolerant plants) is a subject of 
particular concern in our semi-arid climate. Visit the various collections and 
specimens in the Arid Zone Section of the grounds and pick out plants that 
might fit into your particular landscape. 
</P>
<P>
The arboretum sponsors a Community Garden Area, consisting of 48 garden plots 
each planted and maintained by dedicated individuals. These people have done a 
marvelous job with their vegetable and flower plots. Browse through the area on 
a weekend and chat with these enthusiastic gardeners. They'll proudly show you 
their garden and perhaps supply you with a few gardening tips. In addition, 
there is a new organic demonstration garden where you can view vegetables being 
grown organically. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
19th-Century Ambience 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the Historic Section of the arboretum stands Heritage House 
with its surrounding gardens and structures that take you back to the 1890s in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Heritage House was built in 1894 by Dr. George C. Clark, a pioneer Fullerton 
physician. It was both his home and office and has been lovingly and 
authentically restored as a museum depicting Southland family life in the late 
19th Century. It is a prime example of Eastlake Victorian architecture that was 
prevalent in Orange County at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Of special interest are the surrounding gardens, which are reproductions of the 
gardens tended by the doctor's wife. Included here are a kitchen garden 
featuring heirloom vegetable varieties, a cut-flower garden with flowers of the 
era, a culinary herb garden and a fascinating medicinal herb garden like the 
one the doctor utilized to produce the medicines he dispensed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orange County Oranges 
</P>
<P>
In close proximity to Heritage House is the Historical Orchard, devoted to 
fruit trees that were important to the early development of agriculture in 
Orange County. Among trees included here are Bacon, Hass and Furete avocado 
trees grown from the original budwood, and the Olinda Valencia orange tree, a 
variety that contributed so much to Orange County's early economy. 
</P>
<P>
Apropos of orange trees, scattered throughout the various orchard sections are 
specimens of the original trees dating back to the time when the land now 
occupied by the arboretum and university was a working orange grove. 
</P>
<P>
Among other diverse and interesting attractions at the Fullerton Arboretum is a 
working apiary containing beehives maintained by three CSU professors. Honey 
from the hives is on sale at the gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
A stream containing native chub and stickleback fish meanders through the 
beautiful grounds and includes a small waterfall and a lake. 
</P>
<P>
Additional horticultural adventures include a carnivorous-plant bog, an 
extensive cactus and succulent garden, conifer and palm collections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deciduous Display 
</P>
<P>
Homesick for fall foliage? If so, plan to visit the Occidental Section during 
autumn. It is full of deciduous trees adapted to Southern California growing 
conditions, many of which put on a beautiful fall foliage exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are many other plant collections, plant areas and 
interesting individual plant specimens. In the Tropical Section, I was 
delighted with the monkey-hand trees, which got their name from the hand-shaped 
interior of their large red flowers. Incidentally, the tree is pollinated by 
bats. 
</P>
<P>
If you would like to get educationally or culturally involved, the arboretum 
offers many opportunities by providing lectures, tours and demonstrations. 
There is a Heritage House tour on selected Sundays, when the authentically 
furnished interior of the home can be viewed. A Victorian Christmas celebration 
centers on the house during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
A good selection of plants displayed at the arboretum is available at the 
weekend plant sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Endeavor 
</P>
<P>
The arboretum was established in the 1970s by students and faculty at the 
university, along with the City of Fullerton and various community groups. 
</P>
<P>
My tour was conducted by Celia Kutcher, the resident curator-taxonomist, and 
Rico Montenegro, the assistant director. They are part of a small but dedicated 
professional staff that relies heavily on the 800-member Friends of the 
Arboretum support group for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Arboretum is at the northeast corner of the university campus. 
Take the California 57 to Yorba Linda Boulevard. Turn west on Yorba Linda and 
go to the first stoplight, at Associated Road; turn south onto the campus. The 
arboretum is open from 8 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. daily except major holidays. 
Admission is free, but donations are appreciated. Phone (714) 773-3579 for 
information.

FAMILY SPOTS: COMIC BOOK/SCI-FI SALE AIMS AT YOUNG COLLECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN MELINKOFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If a brand-new Batman T-shirt or Batman bubble gum from 7-Eleven no longer is 
enough to satisfy the collectible urge of 10-year-olds, Sunday's show at the 
Los Angeles Comic Book and Science Fiction Convention may do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
The dealers' room at the Shrine Hall will be filled with Batman memorabilia 
spanning five decades (lunch pails and cards from the 1950s). Jerry Robinson, 
one of the artists of the Batman comic books in the 1930s and 1940s, will be on 
hand from noon to 1 p.m. to talk about his experiences. At 1:30 p.m., he will 
present a slide show on old comic books, then move back to the table for 
further discussion in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The day is sort of a Batman-meets-Freddy occasion. Show producer Bruce Schwartz 
has planned a slide preview of "A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child" 
for 2 p.m. Speakers will include Freddy's makeup man, David Miller, and 
visual-effects supervisor Alan Munro. There also will be an exhibit of Freddy 
props. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the Batman/Freddy axis will be dozens of dealers with toys (Star Trek, 
Roger Rabbit), comics, posters and cards -- some rare and expensive and some 
priced just right for a 10-year-old's back pocket (quarter comics). 
</P>
<P>
Show hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $4. The hall is at 700 W. 32nd 
St., around the corner from the Shrine Auditorium. Information: (818) 954-8432.

DAY HIKE: FROM PALMS TO PINES ON MT. SAN JACINTO TRAMWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palm Springs Aerial Tramway makes it easy for hikers to enter Mt. San Jacinto 
Wilderness Area. Starting in Chino Canyon near Palm Springs, a tram takes 
passengers from 2,643-foot Lower Aerial Tramway Terminal (Valley Station) to 
8,516-foot Upper Aerial Tramway Terminal (Mountain Station) at the edge of the 
wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss-made gondola rapidly leaves terra firma behind. Too rapidly, you 
think. It carries you over one of the most abrupt mountain faces in the world, 
over cliffs only a bighorn sheep can scale, over several life zones, from palms 
to pines. The view is fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the tramway was opposed by conservationists who pointed out 
that Mt. San Jacinto slopes were totally unsuited to its stated purpose -- 
skiing. First proposed in the 1930s, the project was finally completed in 1963 
after approval and funding from the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
Now, most nature lovers enjoy witnessing flora and fauna changes equivalent to 
those viewed on a motor trip from the Mojave Desert to the Arctic Circle in 
just minutes. In pre-tramway days, John Muir found the view "the most sublime 
spectacle to be found anywhere on this Earth!" 
</P>
<P>
For an introduction to the Alpine environment of Mt. San Jacinto State Park, 
take the short nature path that begins at Mountain Station, then join Desert 
View Trail for a superb panorama of Palm Springs. After enjoying the view of 
the arid lands below, you can extend your hike by looping through lush Round 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From California 111 at the northern outskirts of Palm 
Springs, turn southwest on Tramway Road and drive 3 1/2 miles to the tramway 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: From Mountain Station, walk down the paved pathway to the signed 
beginning of the trail to Desert View. You join the nature trail for a short 
distance, cross the path used by the "mule ride" and soon get the first of a 
couple of great desert views. The view takes in Palm Springs, Tahquitz and 
other palm-lined canyons of the Agua Caliente Indian Reservation, along with 
the basin and hills of the Coachella Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Continue on Desert View Trail, which makes a full circle and junctions with the 
path back up to Mountain Station. For a longer hike, walk through the Long 
Valley Picnic Area to the state park ranger station. Obtain a wilderness permit 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Continue west on the trail, following the signs to Round Valley. The trail 
parallels Long Valley Creek through a mixed forest of pine and white fir, then 
climbs into lodgepole pine country. Lupine, monkeyflower, scarlet bugler and 
Indian paintbrush are some of the wildflowers that add seasonal splashes of 
color. 
</P>
<P>
After passing a junction with a trail leading toward Willow Creek, another 
three-tenths mile of hiking brings you to Round Valley. There's a trail camp 
and a backcountry ranger station in the valley and splendid places to picnic in 
the meadow or among the lodgepole pines. The truly intrepid hiker will head for 
the summit of Mt. San Jacinto, a 3 1/2-mile ascent from Round Valley. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative to returning the same way is to retrace your steps three-tenths 
of a mile back to the junction with Willow Creek trail, take this trail a mile 
through the pines to another signed junction and follow the signed trail north 
back to Long Valley Ranger Station. This alternative adds only about a 
quarter-mile to your day hike and allows you to make a loop.

MT. LAGUNA SELECTED AS SITE FOR JOB CORPS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A second Job Corps center will open in San Diego County, federal officials 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The facility to train economically disadvantaged youth will be at a former Air 
Force communications station on Mt. Laguna in the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole announced the Mt. Laguna site selection 
along with other new centers for Gadsden, Ala.; Minot, N.D., and 
Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) hailed Dole's choice of the Laguna site, 
pointing out that, if the facility had been in operation during the recent 
Cleveland National Forest fire, which burned 4,600 acres in the area, "two 
strike teams would have been available without delay" to fight the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The Mt. Laguna Job Corps Center will accommodate 250 to 300 men and women from 
16 to 21 years old in residential units, giving them intensive basic 
educational instruction and skills training in fields in which jobs are 
available, Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Silva, Job Corps chief of program management and review, said Friday that 
it is too early to estimate the cost of redeveloping the isolated Air Force 
site into housing and classrooms. The existing buildings have been vacant for 
several years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Job Corps programs are designed to train participants for jobs in the area for 
which there is a demand, Silva said. The facility will not open for several 
years, she added. 
</P>
<P>
The county's first Job Corps center, located at a former helicopter base in 
Imperial Beach, opened in 1979 and has trained thousands of Southern California 
youths in skills such as masonry, bricklaying, culinary arts, welding, business 
office skills and electronics assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Training at the 107 Job Corps centers nationwide is aimed primarily at youths 
who are doing poorly in school or who have dropped out without obtaining 
necessary job skills. 
</P>
<P>
Trainees receive room and board, books, supplies and a small living allowance, 
part of which is paid after the participant has successfully completed the 
course. Job Corps members may stay in the program for up to two years, but the 
average student leaves after eight months.

ZIGGING AND ZAGGING IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
PAIR OF RESEARCH VESSELS READY FOR '89 DOLPHIN COUNT 
</P>

<P>
The courses plotted for the research vessels David Starr Jordan and McArthur 
seem to be more the meanderings of drunken sailors than routes to be followed 
by members of a reputable scientific expedition. 
</P>
<P>
Still, early this morning, the two ships will begin a 10,000-mile voyage to 
nowhere. On Dec. 8, they will return to San Diego, having repeatedly 
crisscrossed a 5-million-square-mile patch of ocean off the coast of Central 
and South America. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 scientists and 51 crew members on board the two vessels will stop for 
provisions and fuel at ports in Mexico, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and 
Clipperton, a tiny dot of an island that sits 1,800 miles west of the Panama 
Canal. But, after each port, the ships will return to the zigzag course that 
seems torn from a log compiled by the mythical Flying Dutchman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fourth of Six Cruises 
</P>
<P>
The seemingly chaotic course is actually a carefully plotted sea voyage, the 
fourth of six annual cruises that the National Marine Fisheries Service is 
conducting to count dolphin populations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration ships are carrying scientists affiliated with the Southwest 
Fisheries Center in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
The zigs and zags built into the course are designed to give scientists an 
annual look at dolphin populations close to shore and in the middle of the vast 
eastern tropical Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Congress authorized the population counts to help marine biologists determine 
how many dolphins are being drowned after becoming trapped in nets that 
commercial fishermen set to catch yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 19,712 dolphins died in the eastern tropical Pacific after being 
snagged by nets set by U. S. fleets. Federal law confines U. S. fishermen to 
the "incidental take" of 20,500 dolphins each year. Foreign countries that 
export tuna to the United States are now required to adopt similar limits. 
</P>
<P>
The research expedition "is a relatively long cruise," according to Doug 
DeMaster, a Southwest Fisheries marine biologist who is serving as chief 
scientist for the expedition. "It's comparable to the Antarctic cruises, which 
last from spring to the end of summer." 
</P>
<P>
Each summer, scientists try to follow a course that is "as identical as 
possible" to the previous summer's voyage, DeMaster said. From San Diego, the 
two research ships will head toward southern Mexico, a three-day trip that 
"will let everyone get their sea legs," said DeMaster, who will remain in San 
Diego during the voyage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Scan for Schools 
</P>
<P>
The ships will then head toward Central and South America. They will work their 
way to the west, toward the Hawaii. They will then double back and crisscross 
the eastern tropical Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Trained observers will use high-powered binoculars to scan the ocean for 
dolphin schools. Scientists aboard a helicopter to be launched from the Jordan 
will verify estimates of school sizes gleaned from shipboard observers. Those 
researchers will also collect physical and biological data that will be used to 
determine how environmental factors affect the distribution of dolphins in the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
However, scientists affiliated with the Southwest Marine Fisheries won't 
release data gathered during the voyage until after the six-year project is 
completed. "We just won't have enough data to say realistically what the 
populations are," DeMasters said. "The longer the time period, the better the 
reliability." 
</P>
<P>
With the data accumulated during six years of study, changes in population of 
about 10% per year can be detected, DeMaster said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists will also use the four-month cruise to study the genetic composition 
of various kinds of dolphins, as well as their "vocalization patterns." They 
will study the diet of sea turtles and the distribution of flying fish, and 
monitor the population of fish, mammals and birds. 
</P>
<P>
Aleta Hahn will be cruise leader on the Jordan, and Liz Edwards will be the 
scientific leader on the McArthur.

LAKE MIRAMAR IMPASSE; 
</P>
<P>
CITIZENS GROUP TO UNDERTAKE NEW BALLOT INITIATIVE TO HALT DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major builder and a citizens group attempting to agree on a compromise that 
would govern development of the picturesque hills north of Lake Miramar have 
reached an impasse, a circumstance that virtually guarantees another bitter 
ballot initiative campaign for control of the land. 
</P>
<P>
The Save Miramar Lake Committee said Friday that it has little choice but to 
begin a second initiative campaign after a task force of community 
representatives Thursday night endorsed McMillin Communities' revised plan for 
developing the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
"All they've done is make cosmetic changes, in our opinion, to the old plan," 
said J. Gary Underwood, co-chairman of the citizens group. "You're just looking 
at bigger boxes," he added. "The same amount of acreage goes under the plow." 
</P>
<P>
In a surprising victory in April, the citizens group forced the City Council to 
scrap a "development agreement" with BCE Development calling for construction 
of 3,360 homes on 1,200 acres north of the lake known as Miramar Ranch North. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Qualified Initiative 
</P>
<P>
With a small budget but a sizable volunteer force, the group -- which opposed 
just 658 of the homes, an industrial park and a four-lane road slated for 
construction immediately north of the lake -- qualified an initiative for the 
ballot calling for repeal of the development contract between the city and the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, they bested BCE, which spent $450,000 to collect signatures 
favoring the project and lost three court battles over the legality of the 
citizens group's effort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scrapped Agreement 
</P>
<P>
But rather than submit the initiative to the voters, the council scrapped the 
agreement at the request of Councilman Ed Struiksma, a longtime backer of the 
project who represents the district. The plan was sent to a task force 
nominated by Struiksma, a group that even some council members contended was 
stacked in favor of the developers. 
</P>
<P>
In so doing, the council ensured that voters would not decide the referendum on 
the same day as they voted on Struiksma's bid for a third term in this 
September's election. Although the timing is difficult to predict, it is 
possible that the Miramar Ranch North project may not come back to the council 
before the Sept. 19 primary election in which Struiksma faces three opponents 
who already are criticizing him for a pro-development record. 
</P>
<P>
Underwood said his group is considering endorsing Struiksma opponent Linda 
Bernhardt, who helped the group plot strategy in its early days. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma declined to comment Friday on the compromise offered by McMillin 
Communities, which has agreed to purchase the Miramar Ranch North site from 
BCE. The sale is still in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Review Plan 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Scripps Ranch and Miramar Ranch North planning groups must now 
review the new plan, Struiksma said, "I don't think I want to try to influence 
the process at this moment." 
</P>
<P>
Steve McGill, senior vice president for McMillin Communities, said the new plan 
contains major concessions to the citizens group. They include building 205 
fewer homes; adding 12 to 14 acres of open space; scrapping a city-approved 
plan for an industrial and office park at the western edge of the lake in favor 
of a smaller industrial park and single family homes; and moving a four-lane 
road farther from the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The developer still will build a badly needed east-west route through Scripps 
Ranch, and the Mercy Road interchange with Interstate 15, McGill said. In 
addition, the company is willing to provide a library, parks and schools 
promised in the earlier development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Sides Far Apart 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the two sides are far apart. The Save Miramar Lake Committee 
wants virtually no building in the landscape north of the lake and is demanding 
that the four-lane road be routed behind a ridge, despite city engineers' 
recommendation that such an alignment would be dangerous. Another alternative 
it presented called for the city to sell bonds to purchase the land as open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Kaufman, a task force member who voted for the McMillin plan, said she 
sympathizes with Underwood's aims, but criticized him for refusing to 
negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"There were never any real answers (from Underwood)," Kaufman said. "Rather 
than trying to work things out or trying to compromise, he would just stick to" 
alternatives he proposed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could say that there would be absolutely no development up there, that's 
what I would vote for," Kaufman said. "But I don't have that choice" because 
the land is privately owned, she added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Outlined 
</P>
<P>
Though the initiative is not yet written, Underwood said he is considering a 
plan that would make it illegal to build near Lake Miramar, Lake Hodges and 
Lake Murray, the three reservoirs situated within the city limits, to protect 
views and water quality. An initiative aimed solely at Lake Miramar might be 
struck down by a court because it would target land owned by one developer, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma, however, noted that much of the land surrounding Lake Murray and 
Lake Hodges is either developed or outside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's either an example of a not very well-thought-out plan or it's just a 
backdoor approach to accomplishing something that they've been trying," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McGill said that McMillin Communities is prepared to mount an opposition 
campaign centered on the benefits the project would provide to Scripps Ranch 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's their initiative, I think they're going to have not just McMillin 
Communities and BCE to contend with," he said. "They're starting to define a 
broader issue that affects others as well."

AFTER SEEING SIGHTS, GRAF TO GO TO WORK

<P>
They stood wide-eyed, clutching undersized rackets and waiting patiently for 
the woman who plays tennis better than the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf, besieged by an staggering number of requests for her time, still 
gave some to eager young fans Friday morning at the San Diego Tennis &amp; 
Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
She smiled. She laughed. She posed for pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Then the official tournament superstar quickly gathered her gear and was 
whisked away in an official tournament vehicle to another destination, another 
commitment, another demand. 
</P>
<P>
"She'll be back at 3 this afternoon," said Graf's agent to no one in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
Graf is the top-seeded player and the top draw of the Great American Bank 
Tennis tournament, to run Monday through Aug. 6 at the San Diego Tennis &amp; 
Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
According to Phil de Picciotto, Graf's agent of nine years, he has received at 
least 40 requests for interviews, excluding press conferences such as the one 
she addressed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I get over 1,000 requests a year," said de Picciotto. "I could easily have her 
calendar filled every day of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Graf, 20, is about to enter her third year as the No.1-ranked player in the 
world. She arrived in San Diego from her second home in Boca Raton, Fla., 
Wednesday night. Here, she has been granted somewhat of a reprieve from the 
attention she receives in her native West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
She is recognized, but she is not bombarded. 
</P>
<P>
"(The recognition) is not as much as anywhere else," Graf said. "In Germany, 
for example, it's not possible to walk around like I do here. They do recognize 
me (here), but it's enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
This is Graf's first tournament appearance since she won Wimbledon three weeks 
ago. After a short vacation to Spain, Graf and her family returned to Bruhl, 
West Germany, for a few days before arriving in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Graf bypassed the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles -- which starts Aug. 7 and 
includes Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and Gabriela Sabatini -- to play in 
this event. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's been telling me (San Diego is) the best place," Graf said. "This is 
the first time I've been here. I was really looking forward to this. I like the 
mountains and the beach. It is much better than L.A. There's not the smog." 
</P>
<P>
Her rigorous schedule has her practicing twice a day with her coach and 
practice partner, Pavel Slozil. Still, Graf is taking advantage of her first 
visit to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't usually get a chance to play in tournament's you've never played in 
before," Graf said. "This is different here. You want to see something new." 
</P>
<P>
All her energies will be focused on tennis beginning with her first-round match 
against Canada's Renee Simpson Monday, but Graf is still allowing time for 
non-tennis interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going deep-sea fishing," she said. "And everyone's telling me to go to Sea 
World. I've been to the one in Miami, but they say the one here is much better. 
I'm sure I'll find a couple more things I can do. Do you recommend any others?" 
</P>
<P>
Opponents would gladly send her on an all-expenses paid tour of the city, 
anything to keep her off the courts. Graf has appeared in 10 consecutive Grand 
Slam finals and won six of them. 
</P>
<P>
But she doesn't keep count. There is no number of tournaments she hopes to win, 
no performance that marks the pinnacle of achievement. She strives, she says, 
simply to do more. 
</P>
<P>
"I never set myself any goals," she said. "I'm always just trying to play the 
best I can. That's what I go for. That's my goal. I hope to reach it someday." 
</P>
<P>
Graf said she is constantly challenging herself to reach new heights in her 
game. She insists she is never bored, just as her rise to this position was 
never easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's been too easy," she said. "I don't think it ever was. Even 
if opponents aren't that strong, you have to try to play better yourself. It's 
never boring." 
</P>
<P>
Graf didn't welcome the suggestion that the tournament's draw isn't enough of a 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not such an easy tournament," she said. "There's Lori McNeil, Zina 
Garrison and Claudia Kohde-Kilsch. It's not like it's going to be that easy. 
It's a great tournament, especially with the U.S. Open coming up." 
</P>
<P>
It has become standard procedure for Graf to rest a week after a tournament, 
giving her body and soul a chance to revive. 
</P>
<P>
Said Graf: "I keep my adrenaline if I take one week off, play in another 
tournament, take a week off. I think this is the best preparation to have. It 
gets your mind away again, gets you ready for the next tournament. I think it's 
the best way to do it, for me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Graf said that while being Steffi "is not easy. I'm getting more and more used 
to it. It could be easier," she never had the chance to fold under the 
inevitable pressure of countrymen simultaneously winning Wimbledon (Boris 
Becker was the men's champion). 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good thing I was leaving right away to Spain," she said. "They 
couldn't catch me really. My father tried to keep everyone away as much as he 
could." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf will play Renee Simpson of Ontario, Canada, Monday at 6:30 p.m. 
"She's an all-around player," Graf said. "I don't know her too much. I haven't 
seen her play." The winner of that match plays the winner of the Betsy 
Nagelsen/Dianne Van Rensburg match Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. . . . Qualifying rounds 
begin today at 11 a.m. to fill the four remaining spots on the main draw. These 
matches are free and open to the public. . . . Four San Diego players are 
entered in the main draw and begin play Monday. Wimbledon quarterfinalist Ros 
Fairbank of Rancho Bernardo, seeded eighth, meets Coronado's Angelica Gavaldon, 
at 15 the youngest player entered. Gavaldon is the two-time defending San Diego 
Section singles champion and is one of two wild-card entrants. Another 
Wimbledon quarterfinalist, San Diego's Gretchen Magers, meets Pascale Paradis 
of France and Robin White, currently of San Diego, meets third-seeded Susan 
Sloane of Lexington, Ky. . . . Rosie Casals, 41, of Sausalito, winner of nine 
Grand Slam events in doubles, is the other wild card player. . . . Zina 
Garrison of Houston, seeded second, meets Australia's Jenny Bryne. . . . 
Baltimore's Pam Shriver will play doubles only.

Chris James and Tony Gwynn stood at the batting cage Friday afternoon 
commiserating. They had each come out for extra batting practice and now, 90 
minutes before gametime, they felt as bad at the plate as if they had spent the 
time reading comic books. 
</P>
<P>
They talked about their struggles and why nothing has seemed to go right 
lately, then stopped. Neither said a word, but each knew what the other was 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
They glanced toward the Dodgers' dugout and grimaced in unison. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
Orel Hershiser, 1988 Cy Young winner and World Series MVP, was pitching 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
James shrugged, smiled and said to Gwynn, "Well, I guess it's up to the 
left-handed hitters to pick us up tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn: "Oh, no, you don't. Hey, he's tougher on lefties than righties." 
</P>
<P>
James, a right-handed hitter, laughed, and said: "You know, you're right. But 
damn, I can't hit these guys, and Hershiser just eats me up." 
</P>
<P>
So Friday night at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, guess who was the most 
surprised when James scored the tying run after one double and knocked in the 
winning run with another in the Padres' 2-1 victory over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you what," James said, "no matter what I did tonight, I still hate 
facing those guys. That's a team you just don't look foward to hitting again. 
With that rotation? Come on, there's no easy guy in there." 
</P>
<P>
Is that the pitching staff that gives you the most trouble? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I know so." 
</P>
<P>
James entered the game with a career .183 batting average against the Dodgers, 
having hit just one homer with nine RBIs in 109 at-bats. And instead of showing 
signs of improvement, he was six for 40 (.150) against them this season. Even 
worse, he owned a career .091 average (one for 11) against Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
"God, I hate facing that guy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine now what Hershiser (12-8) must be thinking of James. 
</P>
<P>
He was pitching in the sixth inning with a 1-0 lead, courtesy of Mickey 
Hatcher's home run in the top of the inning. He had yielded eight base-runners 
in the first five innings, with runners in scoring position in every inning but 
the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
But what did it matter? Eight times the Padres batted with runners in scoring 
position, and eight times they failed. Matter of fact, the only time they even 
managed to hit the ball out of the infield with a runner in scoring position 
was James' two-out fly ball in the third inning, stranding runners at first and 
third. 
</P>
<P>
But then came the sixth. James stroked a curveball just past Jeff Hamilton at 
third base. It caromed off Hamilton's glove and rolled down the left-field 
line. By the time he picked it up, James was standing at second with a double. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to third when Mike Pagliarulo grounded to first baseman Eddie Murray, 
and the Padres broke their 10-inning drought when catcher Mark Parent hit a 
sacrifice fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, it was the Dodgers' turn to blunder their way to a scoreless 
inning. Willie Randolph hit a one-out double to right and was standing at third 
after after Bruce Hurst's wild pitch. All they needed was a base hit or fly 
ball. And they seemingly had the right man at the plate, Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Mickey Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
He may come off as the clown of baseball to most, posing trouble to opposing 
pitchers mostly with his practical jokes, not his bat. But to Hurst, Hatcher 
has seemed every bit as real as Roy Hobbs. 
</P>
<P>
This was a guy who stepped to the plate with a .486 career average against 
Hurst, with 17 hits in 35 at-bats. Heck, he can't even do that during batting 
practice, but against Hurst, he's looked like a Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching oh so carefully to Hatcher, knowing that he could still walk him with 
first base open, Hurst threw a changeup. Hatcher was expecting the fastball. 
Strike three. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened," Hurst said, "I missed his bat, that's all I 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray posed the last threat to drive in Randolph when he slammed a 
zero-and-two pitch down the third-base line. There was Mike Pagliarulo, 
knocking the ball down with his chest. He picked the ball up from the ground, 
fired to first, and beat Murray by a step. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad he's finally on my side," Hurst said. "He did that a lot of times 
against us when I was with Boston. Those are the kind of things that can change 
the whole complexion of the game." 
</P>
<P>
James did just that in the bottom of the eighth. Marvell Wynne singled to right 
field, and with James at the plate, Padre Manager Jack McKeon ordered a 
hit-and-run. All James was trying to do, he'd say later, was hit the ball on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he drove a fastball to the right center-field fence. Right fielder 
Mike Marshall hurriedly picked it up, but too late. Wynne came across the plate 
with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
And just like that, the Padres (50-53) were winners over the Dodgers for the 
sixth time in seven attempts this season. 
</P>
<P>
It also ended a night where it appeared that both teams were daring each other 
to score. 
</P>
<P>
Those fun-loving Dodgers allowed six Padre baserunners in the first three 
innings alone, at least one in the first five innings, and then giggled in 
delight watching the Padres blunder each opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"We sure had our opportunities," McKeon said. "We blew a lot of chances early. 
But hey, we'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Carmelo Martinez celebrated his 29th birthday Friday, but it felt like just 
another day at the ballpark for Martinez, spending it on the bench. He has not 
started a game since July 7, and has just one hit in 21 at-bats since June 25. 
. . . Padre shortstop Garry Templeton was diagnosed Friday morning as having a 
pulled tendon behind his left knee. The doctors at the Scripps Clinic told him 
that he'll likely be out four days and miss the three-game series with the 
Dodgers. Bip Roberts replaced him in the lineup. . . . Catcher Benito Santiago, 
who suffered a bruised left hand when hit Wednesday night by Cincinnati pitcher 
Rick Mahler, was kept out of the lineup Friday with a swollen hand. His status 
is day-to-day. . . . Pitcher Eric Show, who was eligible to come off the 
disabled list Friday, still has not been given clearance to begin working out. 
Troubled by a bulging disk in his back, Show was scheduled again Friday night 
to see doctors. "It's getting better," Show said, "but I just don't know how 
much. I'd like to know what's going to happen. I feel like just testing it, and 
if it goes out again, I'll have it operated on two months early." . . . 
Reliever Dave Leiper, who remained in San Diego during the Padres' trip to 
Cincinnati for further tests on his fluctuating rapid pulse, said that a 
medication for his condition has been prescribed. He began taking it after 
three hour's worth of testing Wednesday and says that he believes the worst is 
behind him. . . . Padre Manager Jack McKeon said he's not interested in picking 
up pitcher Bob Knepper, who was released Friday by the Houston Astros. . . . 
The 37-game hitting streak of Las Vegas Stars second baseman Joey Cora ended 
Thursday against Albuquerque. It was the 13th-longest hitting streak in 
minor-league history but still 24 games shy of Joe DiMaggio's minor-league 
record of 61 games. Cora went zero for three in the game, which was suspended 
Wednesday and completed Thursday. He grounded to shortstop, struck out, flied 
to shallow center and was intentionally walked. . . . Dodger outfielder Kal 
Daniels, who has eight hits his his past 20 at-bats (.400), was given a day off 
to rest his ailing knees. . . . Don Schulze (0-0) and John Wetteland (2-2) are 
the scheduled starters at 7:05 tonight in the second game of the three-game 
series.

FUTURE APPEARS BRIGHT FOR U.S. FIELD HOCKEY THANKS IN PART TO SUCCESSFUL 
VALLEY-AREA PROGRAMS

<P>
LAWTON, Okla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's new wave of sports heroes are being trained in our local schools. 
</P>
<P>
They are young, organized and armed. 
</P>
<P>
They carry sticks. Field hockey sticks. 
</P>
<P>
Dare we question the validity of their movement? 
</P>
<P>
After all, a little more than a decade ago there were those who thought AYSO 
were the call letters for a new-wave radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say we're in the same position AYSO was about 15 years ago," said Matt 
Robbins, a member of the U. S. national field hockey squad. "When I first 
started playing soccer, no one really knew about it. Now, in four years, we're 
going to have the World Cup in L. A." 
</P>
<P>
If field hockey spreads in a similar fashion, it will do so from a base in the 
Conejo and Simi valleys. Or so it would seem. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 60 players invited to participate at the U. S. Olympic Festival this 
week at Cameron University, 24 are from Simi Valley, Moorpark, Thousand Oaks, 
Newbury Park, Camarillo or Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
This did not happen by coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
About eight years ago, a man named Tom Harris made a tour of the elementary and 
junior high schools at Ventura County's east end. 
</P>
<P>
He brought along recruiting posters and enough players to give a short 
exhibition at each stop. 
</P>
<P>
Give me your small, your weak and your bored -- as long as they can run a 
little, he seemed to say. 
</P>
<P>
And they came. Not in droves, but in trickles. 
</P>
<P>
The sport's fast pace gave it a certain appeal for those with youth and an open 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Harris took the most dedicated and the best players -- usually they were one 
and the same -- and formed club teams. The best club players formed all-star 
teams and the best of the all-stars made national squads. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Barakat and Alvin Pagan of Simi Valley joined the sport's youth 
movement on the ground floor and advanced quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Barakat, 22, was unwillingly introduced to the sport at the age of 12. He had 
seen an exhibition at school, but came away unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
When it was time for recess, soccer and basketball were his games. 
</P>
<P>
But when he grabbed a ball and got ready to play, no one else came around. 
</P>
<P>
"All my friends went and played field hockey," Barakat said. "I figured since I 
couldn't beat them, I might as well join them." 
</P>
<P>
Five years later he was playing in the Olympics, an experience he says was "the 
highlight of my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Pagan, 22, took up the sport at the around same time and was invited to the 
Olympic Festival that first year. 
</P>
<P>
"The sport itself hooked me, and the fact that I could improve so fast," Pagan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Travel opportunities are certainly a positive factor. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Amar, 17, from Camarillo, started playing field hockey four years ago. 
Next month, he will be going to Malaysia as a member of the U. S. junior 
national squad. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, he has been to Europe twice to play field hockey, 
something that he says is not lost on his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Through my travels and leaving school, a lot of my friends who had never heard 
of field hockey have noticed it now," Amar said. 
</P>
<P>
Internationally, field hockey's top teams are from Europe, followed by squads 
from Argentina, Canada, the Soviet Union and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, it's a national sport," Pagan said. "Basketball and baseball aren't 
as popular, so they get the players who are tall, bulky and versatile, whereas 
we still have athletes who maybe can't make it in other sports." 
</P>
<P>
Barakat sees that situation changing, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing more young, talented hockey players with more skill than ever 
before," he said. "There is an undying optimism. When we go overseas we are 
inspired by our good play. We believe we're on our way to seeing the kind of 
international results we are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just going to take some time." 
</P>
<P>
That time may be coming soon. The average age for men's players at the Olympic 
Festival is 18, and Mike Lee of Simi Valley is the oldest at 24. 
</P>
<P>
Players from the Valley area have an advantage in terms of development because 
the interest already exists here. 
</P>
<P>
"If I lived somewhere else it would be hard to get motivated to train and their 
wouldn't be a game tempo to train against," Amar said. "But back home, against 
people who want to train hard and play at the top level, you're definitely 
going to improve your skills." 
</P>
<P>
A recently formed program called "MINKEY" -- the first three letters from 
"miniature" and the last three from "hockey" -- is expected to have a positive 
impact on field hockey's development. 
</P>
<P>
MINKEY involves more than 3,000 Valley-area children, providing them with field 
hockey instruction and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We go from school to school and the kids come out for 30 minutes at a time and 
we go all day," Robbins said. "It is the only program of it's kind in the U. S. 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
MINKEY has its origins in Australia, which has one of the world's top teams. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all related to the junior programs they have there, too," Robbins said. 
"And now Southern California has the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
A greater awareness of the need for additional U. S. training facilities for 
all amateur sports also has aided the field hockey movement. 
</P>
<P>
Amar, one of the nation's most promising juniors, has already benefitted from a 
six-month residence camp at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play hockey twice a day, every day, for about six months, you have no 
choice but to improve," Amar said of the experience. 
</P>
<P>
All of which leaves U. S. field hockey enthusiasts all the more confident about 
the country's future in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
And players from the Conejo and Simi Valley areas are leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no fluke that so many of us are from that one area," Robbins said. "It's 
all by design. Some day soon we're going to provide the U. S. with some of the 
best hockey players in the world."

SOUTH TO DRAW ON A VERSATILE CAST IN SHRINE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The team of the future will give an old-fashioned flavor to the Shrine high 
school all-star football game this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Shrine game often features the college and professional stars of tomorrow, 
but the South team has a number of throwbacks to an earlier time, a group of 
modern-day Jim Thorpes who excel on both sides of the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
In these days of specialty football and situation players, the South team, with 
its plethora of two-way players, may seem about as modern as a Model-T, but it 
runs on a turbocharged engine of speedy athletes. 
</P>
<P>
South Coach Bill Redell, the former Crespi High coach, will explore a number of 
combinations when the game kicks off today at 6 p.m. in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"It does give you a lot of versatility," Redell said. "One of the problems in 
an all-star game is giving them the opportunity to play. . . . From an 
offensive standpoint, what we have to do is take advantage of the players we 
have and get them loose in the secondary." 
</P>
<P>
While Redell enjoys a wealth of backfield talent, his options have been 
curtailed somewhat by injuries to a pair of Cal-bound standouts, tailback 
Russell White and quarterback Perry Klein. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, who led Carson to the City Section 4-A title last season, hurt his back 
during practice this week. White, the state career rushing leader at Crespi, 
has tendinitis in his right knee and spent most of the week in therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"He made some very fine progress this week," Redell said of White. "We think 
he'll be able to go, but we won't know until he warms up. He won't start." 
</P>
<P>
Even with White and Klein playing limited roles, Redell will still draw on a 
capable backfield corps. 
</P>
<P>
Jet-quick quarterback Curtis Conway of Hawthorne will be at the throttles for 
the South. The South co-captain was the state 100-meter champion in the spring 
and his speed may also be employed at wide receiver and tailback. 
</P>
<P>
Backup quarterback Ron Redell of Crespi is slated for extra duty at defensive 
back. Strong safety Tommie Smith, also a South co-captain, could play a few 
series in the offensive backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to work him in at tailback," Redell said of Smith, who played at 
Antelope Valley. "A lot of it depends on if Russell can go or not. Tommie may 
be the best tailback we have." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's Sean Burwell may play running back at Oregon but will play 
cornerback for the South. Brian Allen of Hart will start at tight end. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura's Carrick O'Quinn has impressed the South coaching staff and will start 
at inside linebacker. Rick McCathron of Thousand Oaks will back up Palmdale's 
Jim Nevelle at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
The Shrine game matches Northern California's best players against Southern 
California's finest. Southern California leads the series, 17-14 with five 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
This is billed as the 38th Shrine game but is only the 37th time the game has 
been played. It was cancelled in 1984 because of a scheduling conflict.

CLARK IS COSTIC TO PITCHERS IN 12-3 PANORAMA CITY WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adam Clark has always admired the talent of Tim Costic, his former teammate at 
Monroe High and now a fellow member of the Panorama City American Legion 
baseball team. Clark batted behind Costic all season at Monroe and was in the 
same position in Friday's second-round Area 6 playoff game against 
Westlake-Agoura at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, it seemed nobody wanted to pitch to Costic, while they were 
practically lining up to take a shot at Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Clark came through to lead Panorama City to a 12-3 win and into a 12:30 
p.m. showdown today with District 20 rival Woodland Hills West, also unbeaten 
in two Area 6 playoff games. Westlake-Agoura (28-5-4), the District 16 
champion, was eliminated after being outscored, 23-3, in two games. 
</P>
<P>
With a runner on second and Panorama City (23-6) trailing, 2-0, in the fourth, 
Costic was intentionally walked. Clark followed with a two-run double off the 
center-field fence. In the fifth, Costic was thrown four unhittable pitches -- 
amounting to another intentional walk -- and Clark again doubled, driving in a 
run to give Panorama City a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"When they walk a guy ahead of me like that, I get pumped up to hit," Clark 
said. "I really just try to put the ball in play." 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Roland De La Maza (8-0) threw a nine-hitter, struck out 10 and 
walked none and Joe Cascione had four hits for Panorama City. STEVE ELLING

DE LA CERDA TO SIT, THEN RUN AT NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter De La Cerda, a former Granada Hills High track standout, has signed a 
national letter of intent with Cal State Northridge, according to Bob Augello, 
an assistant cross-country and track coach at the university. 
</P>
<P>
But the signing, which was announced Thursday, comes with a hitch. Under 
provisions of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Proposition 48, De La 
Cerda must skip both his freshman cross-country and track seasons because he 
failed to score at least 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
De La Cerda placed 14th in the 3,200 meters at the state championships in June 
and recorded personal bests of 4:01.9 and 9:20.88 in the 1,500 and 3,200 as a 
senior at Granada Hills. De La Cerda, who transferred to Granada Hills for his 
senior track season, was the Del Rey League cross-country champion for Alemany.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: FORMER AZTEC QUARTERBACK BARRICK WILL PLAY FOR 
PALOMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Barrick, who quit the San Diego State University football team before 
spring practice in April, will play for Palomar College this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Barrick, a 1987 Fallbrook High School graduate, said he was contacted Wednesday 
evening by Palomar Coach Tom Craft. The two met Thursday, and Barrick will be 
on the field when Palomar begins practice Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working out with friends who I played high school football with, but 
I was working out with no purpose other than to keep in shape," Barrick said. 
"They were all getting ready for the season, and I missed that." 
</P>
<P>
Barrick, 6-feet-3, 205-pounds, started SDSU's final four games last fall as a 
redshirt freshman. He said he will continue to attend classes at SDSU and take 
enough hours at Palomar to keep him eligible to play football. 
</P>
<P>
Haywood Mathis and Paul Victoria, two freshman linebackers who were redshirted 
last season, will not return to San Diego State University this fall because of 
academic difficulties, according to John Rosenthal, SDSU sports information 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Mathis will enroll at Grossmont College. 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
The Primetime 3-on-3 USA basketball tour will be held Aug. 5 and 6 outside of 
the San Diego County Administrative building on the Embarcadero. The cost is 
$60 per four-person team, $50 if all four players are under 16. Each 
participant will receive a ticket to the Seagram's Coolers All-Star Basketball 
game Aug. 8 at the San Diego Sports Arena. In addition to the 3-on-3 
tournament, players will be able to participate in a slam-dunk contest, a free 
throw contest and a three-point shot competition. For information call 
1-800-888-DUNK.

Lucy Casarez of Bonita had RBI singles in the third and fifth innings as the 
West defeated the North, 5-0, to win the bronze medal in the U.S. Olympic 
Festival women's fast-pitch softball competition at Oklahoma City. The game was

COMPROMISE ON HOLLYWOOD REDEVELOPMENT PANEL URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge, impatient with feuding over efforts to 
redevelop Hollywood, told Los Angeles city officials and a contingent of 
Hollywood residents Friday that they should form a compromise citizens' 
advisory committee to oversee the renewal. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't order you to do it, but I urge you to," said Judge Kurt Lewin. 
"Because I will tell you right now, neither side has a slam dunk at this time 
in this court." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's proposed solution during a court hearing on the makeup of the 
citizens' committee caught both sides by surprise. The city was looking to 
affirm the City Council's right to appoint a new committee, while residents 
hoped to force the city to recognize a 3-year-old, mostly elected panel that 
the council voted to disband in May. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton J. Price, an attorney for the residents, told the judge that he was 
eager to talk compromise, but several residents were less enthusiastic in 
interviews after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always been open to talking," said Robert Nudelman, chairman of the 
officially defunct Project Area Committee. "But I am not thrilled with the 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood-area Councilman Michael Woo persuaded the council to do away with the 
panel after two years of increasingly hostile relations between him and the 
group. He said the panel, dominated by critics of Woo and his plans for 
Hollywood, had become "an official forum for wacky behavior," a reference to 
the group's reputation as rowdy. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the city and the Community Redevelopment Agency said their next 
move will be dictated by the councilman. Woo did not attend the hearing, but he 
said in a telephone interview that he sees "no basis for that kind of 
compromise." 
</P>
<P>
"Today's court hearing has no impact on my intention to announce by next week 
the new citizen participation process for the Hollywood redevelopment program," 
Woo said. "It is hard for me to see how to work out a compromise with a 
committee that essentially doesn't have any legal basis for existence in my 
view." 
</P>
<P>
The judge acknowledged during the hearing that he may ultimately be forced to 
decide whose committee will survive, but he reminded the two sides that a 
compromise would avoid a lengthy and expensive court battle. As a start, the 
judge proposed a committee with an equal number of appointed and elected 
members. If the two sides are unable to reach an agreement, he ordered them 
back Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"If you undertake the resolution of the matter with a focus on who did what to 
whom in history and past perceived insults . . . nothing will ever be 
resolved," Lewin said. "There may be some room for compromise. That can only be 
achieved if the parties sit down together without focusing on what has gone on 
before. Maybe we can turn a new page here." 
</P>
<P>
The city and a core of Hollywood residents have been at odds for several years 
over the 1.7-square-mile Hollywood project. Residents fear that the 
$922-million face-lift of the once-thriving movie capital will lead to unwanted 
construction and widespread evictions. 
</P>
<P>
A residents' group and the redevelopment agency have been locked in a separate 
court battle for several years over allegations that the redevelopment plan was 
illegally written to favor big business interests over those of small 
businesses and homeowners. A Superior Court judge in January ruled in favor of 
the agency, but an appeal last month has kept frozen more than $2 million in 
property tax funds earmarked for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the city and its critics in Hollywood worsened in May when 
the City Council voted to do away with the Project Area Committee and replace 
it with a committee appointed by Woo. 
</P>
<P>
But most Project Area Committee members refused to yield and have continued to 
meet unofficially. They claim that the council's decision was aimed at 
squelching voices of opposition after redevelopment critics, including several 
involved in the lawsuit over the drafting of the redevelopment plan, gained a 
majority on the committee for the first time in elections last December. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one of the committee's 25 members were elected by residents, businesses 
and community groups in Hollywood. Woo appointed the remaining four. The 
appointed members and several elected members resigned from the group after the 
City Council dissolved it in May. 
</P>
<P>
The Project Area Committee was established to review various aspects of the 
renewal effort, including proposed traffic and urban design plans as well as 
some individual construction projects. It has made recommendations to the 
redevelopment agency but has no official decision-making powers. Woo has said 
his new appointed panel would assume many of the same responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, defiant Project Area Committee members challenged in court the 
council's May vote, arguing that the redevelopment plan requires the city to 
consult with the committee throughout the implementation of the plan, which 
could cover its entire 30-year life span. The committee asked Lewin to force 
the city to recognize it and to start paying some disputed bills. Lewin 
postponed last month's hearing until Friday to let the city and the CRA 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
City and CRA attorneys contend that under state law, the agency is required to 
consult with the Project Area Committee for three years after adoption of the 
redevelopment plan. After the three-year period -- which ended in May -- the 
City Council can either extend the life of the committee or let it expire, they 
argue. 
</P>
<P>
At the Friday hearing, Lewin said "either side could prevail" in the case but 
he expressed bewilderment at the city's preference for appointed, over elected, 
committee members. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to explain to Americans that . . . individuals directly elected by 
their neighbors ought not to participate in their government," he said.

The state of California kicked off a campaign Friday targeted at blacks, women 
and teen-agers about the dangers of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The $300,000 campaign, coordinated through AIDS Project Los Angeles, features 
public service announcements with actress/director Debbie Allen, rap artist LL 
Cool J and boxer Henry Tillman, winner of a gold medal at the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Messing around with drugs and unsafe sex is like boxing without your gloves 
on," Tillman said in one of the announcements. 
</P>
<P>
The campaigns, announced at a press conference at the Community Youth Sports 
and Arts Foundation in Los Angeles, focuses on the free and anonymous testing 
for the HIV antibody available at the state's 90 test sites.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 KILLED, 5 WOUNDED IN GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gang gunmen who approached their victims on foot instead of the usual 
slow-moving car killed two rivals and wounded five in two unrelated attacks 
within 20 minutes of each other on South Los Angeles streets, police said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The first attack occurred about 8:30 p.m. Thursday as a group of people stood 
talking near the intersection of 74th Street and Broadway, Lt. Bob Kimball 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One or more gunmen walked up and began firing, hitting four people. One, Alonzo 
Williams, 26, died soon after at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Three people in their mid-20s, including a woman, were hospitalized. All were 
believed to be gang members. None was identified. 
</P>
<P>
In the second attack, about 20 minutes later on West Vernon Avenue, a gunman 
walked up to a group of people, opened fire and then ran away. One of the three 
people hit, Troy Shaw, 20, a gang member, died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 
Detective Patrick Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Two men, one 19 years old and the other 36, were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball said the attacks involved separate gangs and were not related.

POLICE ARREST WIFE OF MAN SUSPECTED OF KILLING COMPOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A woman whose husband was arrested in the fatal stabbing of a Hollywood Hills 
television composer has also been taken into custody in connection with the 
murder, Los Angeles police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Purugganan, 20, was arrested late Thursday night in a Riverside motel 
room she was sharing with the couple's two small children. Riverside police 
found her at the Arlington Motor Lodge only four hours after her husband, 
Juanito Pascua Purugganan, was arrested in connection with last week's slaying 
of 29-year-old composer Doug Timm, said Detective Rick Swanston of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Their 2 1/2-year-old daughter and 10-month-old son were being cared for by 
grandparents in Santa Ana, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple is being held without bail on suspicion of murder. They are expected 
to be arraigned next week, but no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Juanito Purugganan, 29, was arrested Thursday about 6 p.m. while driving Timm's 
sports car through Riverside, but Michelle and the children were not with him. 
Swanston said Purugganan directed police to his wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
The detective alleged that the couple killed Timm to rob him of the expensive 
recording equipment the composer kept in his two-story home. He said police are 
also investigating the possibility that the suspects may have been involved in 
similar crimes in Los Angeles County and surrounding areas, but he declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The detective said the partially decomposed body of Timm, who worked on scores 
for television programs such as "The New Mike Hammer" and "Designing Women," 
was found Wednesday at the bottom of a living room stairwell in his home in the 
6900 block of Camrose Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said Timm was stabbed several times in the upper torso -- probably 
with a 12-inch butcher knife recovered from his home -- either on July 21 or 
July 22. 
</P>
<P>
Timm, who lived alone but was engaged, had invited the Purugganans to his home 
following a "chance meeting" in Hollywood, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like he had known them for a very short period of time, probably less 
than a week," the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the Purugganans were arrested, Swanston said, police officers 
recovered "several thousand dollars worth" of the dead composer's keyboards and 
digital recording equipment from the Long Beach home of an acquaintance of the 
suspects. The man said the Purugganans sold him the items, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The man who bought the equipment became suspicious about the circumstance and 
started making inquiries," Swanston said. "Eventually, he and the police made 
contact." 
</P>
<P>
After Timm's body was found, the man's statements helped police track down 
Juanito, who was arrested Thursday as he drove Timm's black 1987 Toyota MR-2 
sports car. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston described the couple as drifters who had recently returned to Los 
Angeles after living for several years in Hawaii, where they worked as a waiter 
and waitress. 
</P>
<P>
"They seemed to be very transient," Swanston said Friday. "Apparently, in the 
last few months, they have just been street people." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Purugganans were married three years ago -- when Juanito divorced 
Michelle's mother to marry her. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been with Michelle's mother for about six or seven years," Swanston 
said. "He was (Michelle's) stepfather for a period of time, but he left her 
mother for the daughter."

INS WORKS ON SPRUCING UP PUBLIC IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ofelia Morales had arrived early in the morning at the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service office in Los Angeles to inquire about getting her 
parents admitted into this country from Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
"They make you wait and wait and wait," she complained later in the day when 
she still had not been helped. 
</P>
<P>
"Home of the brave and land of the free? Ha! . . . Land of the forever 
patient," she scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
Described by some critics as the most discourteous arm of the federal 
government, INS officials have decided to try to spruce up their tarnished 
image under the slogan "How are we doing?" 
</P>
<P>
Beginning as early as next week, visitors to any INS office in Southern 
California and the rest of the agency's Western region will be encouraged to 
fill out forms evaluating immigration personnel and the information they 
received, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
And if the need arises, visitors are free to file complaints alleging rudeness, 
unnecessary delays in getting assistance or other problems. These complaints 
will be thoroughly investigated, officials promised. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, INS district offices in the region -- which includes 
California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam -- will be assigned community 
relations staffers to conduct outreach programs and work with local ethnic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the initiatives ordered by Robert M. Moschorak, who was 
recently named to temporarily replace Harold Ezell as INS Western regional 
commissioner, seem simple enough. Most federal agencies have public evaluation 
questionnaires and conduct outreach programs to publicize their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But for the INS, which enforces the nation's emotionally tinged immigration 
laws, such efforts have been largely overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
While INS officials for years pushed for more Border Patrol officers to fight 
illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, few resources were sought for 
the agency's front counters, where overworked staffers sought to deal with the 
deluge of routine requests, ranging from replacing a lost "green card" to how 
to bring a naturalized U.S. citizen's parents into the country. 
</P>
<P>
In some INS offices, critics contend, visitors routinely waited two and three 
days for information that could have been obtained in less than 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 'Black Hole' 
</P>
<P>
At the INS' large public-assistance office at the downtown Los Angeles Federal 
Building -- dubbed the "black hole" by some critics -- so many complaints were 
received that the INS in 1986 instituted an appointment system to handle the 
hundreds of people who jammed Room 1001, the INS' public-assistance office, 
each day. The program met with some success but resources were eventually 
siphoned off when personnel were reallocated to handle amnesty applications. 
</P>
<P>
Moschorak, aware of the bitter criticism, is determined to improve the agency's 
standing with the general public. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this program is absolutely necessary," said Moschorak, an INS veteran 
of nearly 25 years. "That image of ours has to be cleaned up." 
</P>
<P>
Moschorak said courteous personnel can help reverse the bad image INS has with 
the general public, especially with Latinos. INS officials are fond of pointing 
out that despite the reservations many immigrants have about the agency, nearly 
60% of the 3 million aliens who came out of the shadows and applied for amnesty 
were from the INS' Western region. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the evaluations could help influence pay raises and career 
advancements for INS office workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Efforts 
</P>
<P>
The critiquing was one of four special areas of emphasis recently announced by 
Moschorak. In addition to assigning community relations specialists, he also 
ordered sustained efforts to apprehend and deport criminal aliens and to 
complete Phase II of the amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
Success for these initiatives may also enhance Moschorak's chances of 
permanently succeeding Ezell, his former boss. At a recent gathering, Moschorak 
was surprised by 200 INS staffers who sported "Commissioner Bob Fan Club" 
badges. "I won't soon forget the feeling in that room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials have called Ben Davidian, chairman of the 
California Agricultural Labor Relations Board, the leading candidate to succeed 
Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
While Moschorak was optimistic about the public-critique program, visitors to 
Room 1001 late Wednesday were roundly derisive about it. 
</P>
<P>
"These people don't care about us," said Felipe Soto, a Mexican immigrant who 
was there seeking to replace a stolen legal residency card. "I don't even want 
to tell you what they told me . . . jerks."

ANGRY BUCKEY IS GRILLED ON HIS BEHAVIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McMartin Pre-School teacher Ray Buckey was cross-examined for three hours 
Friday about his drinking problem, reports of nighttime screaming bouts, his 
disdain for underwear and his collection of adult pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 31, dressed smartly in a pink shirt and gray suit, told Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Lael Rubin that he did not dispose of the sexually explicit pictures he 
had carefully cut from magazines -- despite advice from his lawyer's 
investigator to get rid of them -- "because I still used them" for sexual 
gratification. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was not until the police "started banging on the door" of his 
parents' home just before his arrest that he "panicked and went to get them and 
tried to flush them down the toilet and threw them out the window." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temper Flares 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's temper flared as Rubin hammered away at the life style he admitted to 
on direct examination earlier this week -- skipping college classes to play 
volleyball and "hang out," deceiving his parents, drinking heavily and being 
convicted of drunk driving, and showing a preoccupation with pictures of a 
specific sexual act that he kept under his pillow or mattress. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from those pictures, Rubin asked, "did anybody ever give you any advice 
about getting rid of or destroying any other piece of evidence?" 
</P>
<P>
Buckey took issue with the word "other." 
</P>
<P>
"Is it your belief that those exhibits in front of you . . . are not evidence?" 
she asked him. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidence of what? That I masturbate?" he said angrily. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidence, Mr. Buckey," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it's any relevant evidence at all," he protested. "What's that 
got to do with allegations of molesting children?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you asking me?" Rubin countered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Intervenes 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders halted the heated exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was a rhetorical question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said he had no knowledge of any evidence being removed from his family's 
Manhattan Beach home or nursery school just before a police search. 
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said, outside the jury's presence, that Buckey was present at a 1986 
hearing before another judge when several items removed by the investigator 
were discussed. Some were turned over to the prosecution and others were 
determined to be an invasion of Buckey's privacy and withheld, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders said he would study the transcripts before deciding whether Rubin can 
pursue the issue in front of the jury. The defense investigator who allegedly 
removed the items committed suicide on the eve of his scheduled testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, who is charged with 53 counts of molestation and conspiracy involving 
11 children, took the witness stand Wednesday for the first time since his 
arrest nearly six years ago. He denied any wrongdoing, blaming the case against 
him on inept interviewing methods and misguided adults. 
</P>
<P>
He testified that he was not working at the school when some of his accusers 
attended, and was seldom alone with the others. 
</P>
<P>
He verified school records, however, that show he was the only teacher on duty 
the afternoon of Aug. 11, 1983, the day that a 2 1/2-year-old boy reported he 
was molested, triggering the investigation. He said 10 children stayed for 
afternoon care and that all but two parents had picked up their children by 4 
p.m. when the youngster left.

HEALTH CARE COSTS CREATE EPIDEMIC OF CONCERN IN MANY DENOMINATIONS

While thanking this summer's General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church 
(U.S.A.) for a "wonderful year," outgoing Moderator Kenneth Hall also ended on 
a worried note -- one of enormous practical importance for many small and 
average-size churches. 
</P>
<P>
"Health care costs have become a burden on our churches," Hall said, then 
warned that congregations with fewer than 200 members may no longer be able to 
afford (the salary and benefits of) a full-time pastor. 
</P>
<P>
Hall could have been speaking for most of America's mainline denominations.

Virtually all of the major churches have been hit hard by ballooning costs and 
view the medical coverage situation as critical. 
</P>
<P>
Denominations are groping for ways to contain insurance costs while still 
maintaining benefits. But with national health care expenditures rising about 
9% annually for much of the past decade, it is an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, most churches employ one of two basic methods for providing 
coverage. Some use commercial insurance companies for ministers and other 
workers. Others use denomination-based health plans. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, an array of variations available. For instance, some 
denominations provide national plans that are mandatory for all clergy. In 
other churches, participation in medical plans is optional. Still others 
provide coverage by region or district and, in some cases, individual ministers 
are responsible for providing their own coverage based on a congregation's 
ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what form is used or how well the funds are managed, the churches 
have no control over the never-ending increases in medical costs that are 
causing nightmares for providers of health care coverage in every segment of 
society. 
</P>
<P>
But the one big disadvantage for the churches, as one church executive points 
out, is that denominations, unlike businesses, cannot increase the price of 
their product to meet the rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
The churches have taken some action aimed at bringing costs under control by 
increasing premiums and deductibles (the amount the insured must pay before the 
insurance plan takes effect) and by cutting back on coverage. But those 
measures represent only the first steps up the mountain of costs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the hardest hit by the crisis are some ministers of smaller congregations 
who have begun to divert funds from their pension plans in order to pay for 
limited medical coverage. And denominations fear that others may be left 
unprotected, forced to drop medical insurance altogether because their 
congregations cannot generate enough income to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Few churches have gone unaffected by problems of escalating medical costs, as a 
survey of denominations illustrates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH (U.S.A.) 
</P>
<P>
In hope of gaining some control over steadily rising costs that contributed to 
a major medical fund net loss of $18 million during 1988, the church has been 
casting about to find a company that will take on the church's troubled 
self-insured medical plan. 
</P>
<P>
However, as of mid-July, none of the 12 insurance companies contacted would 
touch the plan, which hit local congregations with a 3% increase on the 
pastor's salary and housing in 1988 and a 2% increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia B. Smith, vice president of benefits for the church's Board of 
Pensions, said experts in the field are not optimistic that the church will be 
able to find an insurance company willing to operate a churchwide program that 
gives members any better deal than they now have. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, to Smith the future looks grim: "There will continue to be increases 
and/or benefit reductions as long as the rate of inflation continues to go up 
each year. That's just simple mathematics." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the premium rate increases in the last two years, the 
Presbyterian plan, effective last Jan. 1, increased the deductible charged to 
members on the family plan from 2% of salary to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
"Our experience . . . is practically identical to what is happening in the 
American economy in general," said Smith. "We are facing the same tough 
decision as every other entity out there." 
</P>
<P>
But there is one critical difference between the way rising medical costs 
affect churches and the businesses that produce a product, she noted, 
explaining, "We can't add on to the cost of another widget." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST 
</P>
<P>
At its General Synod earlier this summer, the United Church of Christ approved 
a resolution noting that premium rates for the church's self-insured medical 
plan escalated by 40% in 1988 and "are quickly moving beyond small churches' 
and retired clergy's financial ability to participate, and may leave many 
persons uninsured and at risk." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution encourages all UCC churches and national bodies to participate 
in the church's voluntary plan as a strategy for reducing premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Joan F. Brannick, administrative vice president of the United Church of Christ 
Pension Boards, said UCC policy requires churches to provide medical benefits 
to clergy, either through the church's plan or other options. 
</P>
<P>
While she said she knows of no situation where ministers are going without 
benefits, Brannick would not rule out that possibility, saying, "My guess is 
that there are as many variations as you can imagine because there are very 
small churches feeling the pinch." 
</P>
<P>
Not only have premium rates for the church-sponsored medical plan escalated by 
40% in the past year, but deductible amounts have been increased as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UNITED METHODIST CHURCH 
</P>
<P>
The United Methodist Church's Board of Pensions last week authorized a task 
force to examine the feasibility of establishing a church-wide medical benefits 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, each United Methodist "annual conference," or regional body, 
oversees its own medical program. But cost increases averaging about 20% 
annually in the last several years and the disparity in benefits provided from 
conference to conference have created "an incredible amount of discussion" 
within the denomination, prompting establishment of the task force, according 
to the Rev. Tom Marston, director of the board's Benefits Department. 
</P>
<P>
Marston said the church finds itself in "a very fluctuating situation," as some 
conferences consider dropping plans provided by insurance companies in favor of 
their own self-insured plans, while other conferences proceed in the reverse 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're trying to take the best-educated guess," said Marston. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH IN AMERICA 
</P>
<P>
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, formed in 1988 from a merger of 
three predecessors, paid $38 million in medical claims out of its medical plan 
in 1988, and without changes in the church's plan those costs are expected to 
increase to $45 million this year and to $53 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
At its Churchwide Assembly to be held in August, the church is scheduled to 
consider recommendations by its Board of Pensions calling for optional coverage 
for spouses and dependents and an increase in member costs from the current 10% 
to 20% of eligible expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn A. Barrus, vice president for medical/dental administration for the 
Board of Pensions, said, "It is unfortunate that the ELCA started out at a time 
when medical costs were increasing tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
During the young denomination's first year, she reported, rising costs forced 
the church to increase medical premium charges from 8.1% to 9.9% of employee 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
According to Barrus, contribution rates are likely to increase from 9.9% of 
employee compensation to 13.5% if the Board of Pensions recommendations are not 
approved by the Churchwide Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION 
</P>
<P>
John Dudley, senior vice president of insurance services for the Southern 
Baptist Convention, which is enrolled in an Aetna Life and Casualty plan, said, 
"I would say it's approaching the critical point. . . . We're greatly concerned 
about our churches continuing to be able to afford these rate increases." 
</P>
<P>
Under SBC policy, medical coverage is not required for clergy or lay workers. 
While 37,000 Southern Baptist churches, or roughly half the denomination total, 
participate in the Aetna plan, Dudley said he believes many of the smaller 
churches simply do not provide medical coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"The salaries of the pastors and the congregations just don't allow for that," 
Dudley said. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, he said, employees are diverting contributions away from 
their pension plans in order to maintain health benefits. "I suspect we're 
going to see greater numbers dropping by the wayside if this thing continues," 
Dudley predicted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 
</P>
<P>
Sister Christine Matthews, executive director of the Roman Catholic National 
Assn. of Church Personnel Administrators, noted that each Catholic diocese in 
the country decides its own medical coverage policy. 
</P>
<P>
While Sister Matthews said she had not noticed any patterns in the ways 
dioceses are responding to increasing medical costs, she did say one thing is 
clear -- the situation is critical. 
</P>
<P>
Among some of the options being explored are statewide plans that would include 
more than one diocese, "cafeteria" plans that give employees more choices on 
the kinds of coverage they can purchase, and raising deductibles. 
</P>
<P>
"Dioceses are looking for ways to use the money wisely and still keep the best 
benefits for employees." Commenting on the general health care cost crisis, she 
said, "I think something has to be done in this country to help cope."

CALGARIANS FAN SPIRIT OF OLYMPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
CALGARY, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans were announced during the recent Calgary Exhibition and Stampede to take 
what residents call, "The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth," on the road to 
Toronto and, perhaps, other outposts of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
It would be better, some think, to give the Calgary Stampeders a one-way ticket 
to anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Stampeders are the hapless Canadian Football League entry that has been 
doing little to elevate Calgary as a major sports center. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two years ago, this was the host city for the most successful Winter 
Olympics. Organizers maintain that the Games drew about 180 million spectators 
-- fans who went to more than one event were counted at each event -- and 
turned a profit of $260 million, most of which was distributed to the 
International Olympic Committee and national sports associations. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Calgary Flames, after selling 18,000 season tickets, brought 
hockey's Stanley Cup to town -- the city's first major sports trophy (the 
Stampeders won the CFL championship in 1971). 
</P>
<P>
And the Stampede, dating to 1912, goes on and on as a frolicking fixture of 
frontier tradition. It hit a peak of 1,213,646 in attendance in '88. 
</P>
<P>
The Stampeders drew only 197,775 for nine games last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame burns on at Canada Olympic Park on the west end of town. But 
after the flame, and after the Flames, does Calgary turn back into a cowtown 
again? 
</P>
<P>
Many Canadians don't consider it to be a cowtown at all, but most of them live 
west of Toronto, the cosmopolitan center of commerce in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary lies on Trans-Canada Highway 1, about 150 miles north of the U.S. 
border on the rolling plains of southern Alberta. With 670,000 people, it is 
Canada's fourth-largest city, after Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Vistors to Canada generally are better acquainted with the three other cities 
-- or were until the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Frank King, the businessman who chaired the organizing committee for the Games, 
said, "It isn't often a city is given the chance to show its stuff and stage a 
world-stature event. A lot of people were surprised when they came here. They 
found it's not only a modern city but a friendly city. Our people are natural 
hosts. They still have a pioneer spirit." 
</P>
<P>
With that spirit, they were undaunted by the prospect of staging the Games. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Mitchell, a Calgary lawyer and a former CFL commissioner who assisted with 
the city's bid for the Winter Olympics, said, "I haven't seen a city with the 
extent of volunteer spirit that puts on the Stampede every year. 
</P>
<P>
"The same spirit was there for the Olympics. There were more volunteers than 
jobs for them." 
</P>
<P>
King said that IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch told him, " 'The Olympic 
spirit was reborn in Calgary.' " 
</P>
<P>
Samaranch also was pleased when $110 million of the profits -- the first turned 
by any Winter Olympics -- went to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
But that might be about as good as it gets. There won't be another Winter 
Olympics here soon, the Flames won't win the Stanley Cup every year, and the 
Stampeders -- winless in two practice games and two regular-season games until 
upsetting British Columbia at Vancouver Thursday night -- seem doomed to 
mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary does have a highly successful minor league baseball operation, the 
Cannons, a Seattle Mariners farm club that attracts about 4,000 a night to 
7,500-seat Foothill Park with low prices and effective, family-style 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
"The games are secondary," said Tom Keyser, a Calgary Herald columnist. "The 
players are from somewhere else and want to be somewhere else -- the majors. 
But the franchise has a fabulous success story." 
</P>
<P>
There also are the Calgary 88s, who are regarded as a model franchise in the 
World Basketball League for players 6-foot-5 and shorter. The club averages 
about 3,500 in attendance in the Saddledome. 
</P>
<P>
Although Toronto and Montreal have had major league baseball for years, not 
even Calgary's most enthusiastic boosters believe it has much hope of obtaining 
a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
The city lacks a major league stadium and, given its climate, would certainly 
need a dome. 
</P>
<P>
"But the stadium would be the least of the problems," King said. "I think the 
fans would support it, but realistically, it's not in the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
King said he asked Peter Ueberroth -- his counterpart with Los Angeles' 1984 
Olympics and later the commissioner of baseball -- about the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"(Ueberroth) said, 'It's a nice thought, but quite frankly, there are many 
other cities (more qualified).' " 
</P>
<P>
There was a thought that an Alberta franchise could nearly double its base of 
support by sharing a franchise with Edmonton, a 3 1/2-hour drive north. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't work," Mitchell said. "Too much rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
Do you think Edmonton was jealous when Calgary staged the Winter Olympics? Do 
you know what Edmontonians said when Calgarians bragged about their Stanley 
Cup? 
</P>
<P>
"We've won four," they said. 
</P>
<P>
The CFL's Edmonton Eskimos also have won six Grey Cups and qualified for the 
playoffs 18 straight seasons, while the Stampeders have reached postseason play 
only four times since '71. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mitchell: "One thing (Calgarians) can't stand is losing to Edmonton." 
</P>
<P>
It happened again in a CFL game last week, 54-4, at Calgary. And with five 
Stampeder starters out with injuries, the outlook for the rest of the season is 
dreadful. 
</P>
<P>
The club changes coaches with every shift in the weather, but it probably 
doesn't need a coach as much as it needs a Sgt. Preston to lead it out of the 
wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Or they could use another franchise fixer such as Jim Finks, who was general 
manager of the Stampeders in the '60s. Finks, president and general manager of 
the New Orleans Saints, might soon be tied up in a new job as commissioner of 
the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report, the current -- and curiously popular -- general manager, 
Normie Kwong, was considering addressing the sad state of affairs by leaving 
town for three weeks next month. Kwong also is a minority owner of the Flames 
and could accompany the hockey team on its trip to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon Stadium, site of the Olympics' opening and closing ceremonies, got a 
$15.8-million face lift for the Games but remains a relic, open to Arctic winds 
at both ends. And with an average of only 21,975 a game showing up for the 
Stampeders last season, there is no demand to enlarge its 38,000-seat capacity. 
</P>
<P>
King said: "I just joined the board of the Stampeders to see if I could help 
solve that problem. I think one problem is that the fans are very selective 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Worse, the Stampeders, community-owned and run by a board, seem to live under a 
curse -- they lost their top two quarterbacks in their first two exhibition 
games -- and haven't helped themselves with effective organization or 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Maki, a sports columnist for the Herald, said the club operates from "a 
blueprint for disaster. As soon as the Flames came to town (from Atlanta in 
'83), the Stampeders' problems began. (The Flames) were doing things the Stamps 
never did." 
</P>
<P>
Keyser, though, thinks the potential is apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"Calgary is a fanatical sports town," he said. "When they won the Grey Cup in 
'48, some of the yahoos went down to Toronto and rode a horse into the Royal 
York Hotel." 
</P>
<P>
But it's that same high-spirited, uninhibited attitude that glitzy Torontonians 
don't seem to understand about Calgarians. 
</P>
<P>
When the Toronto folk heard that a limited version of the Stampede was headed 
their way, animal rights groups there immediately protested the whole idea of a 
rodeo for inflicting pain and abuse on innocent creatures. 
</P>
<P>
True, horses have been killed in the popular chuck wagon races, a calf's neck 
was broken this summer in the roping competition, and a bull rider lost an eye. 
</P>
<P>
But they accept those things. One cowboy competing here suffered a broken leg 
-- and didn't know it for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the bull rider's accident, the rodeo announcer said, "Thank God 
it's only the loss of an eye. He'll probably be back with a patch, riding, in a 
couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Mitchell grew up in Calgary, lived in Toronto for five years when he 
was CFL commissioner and returned to Calgary last January. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw some changes when I came back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Stampede hadn't changed much -- the midway was bigger and louder than ever, 
featuring every hokey attraction from high divers to thrill rides to country 
music to a guy playing, "I Love Paris," on a tuba. 
</P>
<P>
But is this what Calgary wants to be? 
</P>
<P>
Maki said: "The city is caught between its Stampede image and a desire to be 
upscale cultural. I think the city is still trying to find its image." 
</P>
<P>
Surely, after every Stampede the cowboy hats and boots go back into the closet 
for another year, replaced by three-piece suits and pumps. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this has to be the yuppie capital of Canada," Keyser said. "The 
business section of our paper is the No. 1 read. A lot of these people came 
from Toronto because they couldn't afford to buy a house there. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Calgary is pretty sophisticated. We all watch David Letterman. All the 
silly American trends come up here." 
</P>
<P>
Also a lot of silly Americans. About 10% of the city's citizens are from south 
of the border. They came for the oil business and to follow the shift of 
corporate headquarters for related enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil is what makes us tick," said Paul Rosenberg, publicity and promotion 
manager for the Stampede, pointing out that Calgary is more than cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
And, Rosenberg said, the Stampede is "more than just a rodeo. We're not taking 
the Stampede to Toronto. We're taking some of the most interesting elements, 
such as the rodeo and the free pancake breakfasts." 
</P>
<P>
But some locals expressed fear that the city will be misrepresented. A Herald 
editorial said: "It's almost certain to turn out badly . . . (because) it can't 
recreate the entire mood of a city," and snooty Torontonians would be given new 
fodder for jokes about their country cousins from the West, confirming their 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
But a town with main thoroughfares named Deerfoot Trail and Crowchild Trail 
might have trouble convincing anyone it's sophisticated enough to support major 
league sports. 
</P>
<P>
Can pro football make it big here? 
</P>
<P>
"I think this city would go crazy if it had a competitive team," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
A larger question is, would Calgary be willing to shed its cowtown image to go 
big league? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody is kind of secretly proud of it," Keyser said.

MORNING BRIEFING: AS A BOXING FAN, TYSON PREFERS THE LITTLE GUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Tyson, who spent many a night watching old fight films with the late Cus 
D'Amato, told the New York Times, "I've got a lot of those guys in me. But can 
I tell you something? I'm not a heavyweight fan. I like the little guys. Joe 
Gans. Battling Nelson. Henry Armstrong. Owen Moran. Cus always thought 
Armstrong was the best fighter ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Cus loved Armstrong, and I'm crazy about Sugar Ray Robinson, but Armstrong 
could've gone 20, 25 rounds. I don't know if Robinson could. Robinson was 
dangerous when he was hurt, but overall he's not my style. I like the mean 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
He told of how Ace Hudkins stood up to the big punch of Ruby Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
"When Goldstein hit you, that was supposed to be it," Tyson said. "But when 
Goldstein hit Hudkins, Hudkins not only didn't go down, he stood there growling 
and snarling at Goldstein. That's my kind of fighter." 
</P>
<P>
Add Tyson: Of John L. Sullivan, he said, "I like his confidence, his arrogance. 
I like the way he used to say, 'I can beat any man in the house.' That's where 
I got my saying that I can beat any man on the planet. I'm not being 
egotistical, but I'm the heavyweight champion. I have no peer. I'm the only 
one."Trivia time: What was the name of the sportswriter played by Robert Duvall 
in "The Natural?" 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told-Dept. World record-holder Butch Reynolds, upset in the 
Olympic 400 meters by Steve Lewis, told USA Today that he was distracted when 
Nigeria's Innocent Egbunike called the runners together for a prayer before the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"We held hands and got down on one knee," Reynolds said. "You're supposed to 
hate your opponents before a race. I don't think Mike Tyson would do that with 
Carl (the Truth) Williams." 
</P>
<P>
Yogi knew: After Johnny Bench had broken Yogi Berra's record for most home runs 
by a catcher, Berra sent him the following wire: "Congratulations on breaking 
my record last night. I always thought the record would stand until it was 
broken." 
</P>
<P>
Spoilsports: Wrote Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Press, in a column on the 
merchandising of Bo Jackson by Nike: "As part of its scheme, Nike tried to 
persuade the Los Angeles Kings to select Bo in the final round of last month's 
National Hockey League draft. The Kings thought at first that Nike was kidding. 
Nike wasn't, but the Kings turned them down." 
</P>
<P>
Liberated Cowboy: From wide receiver Michael Irvin of the Dallas Cowboys: "It 
was out-of-hand boring last year. The difference between this year's team and 
last year's team is like heads and tails on a coin. If you flip that coin, you 
will notice that there is nothing the same on either side except the silver. 
The only thing that will be the same about this year's team is the colors." 
</P>
<P>
Keep 'em guessing: From Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening Sun: "One reason 
Danny Ferry was so shocked being selected second overall in the NBA draft by 
the Clippers is the club had Glen Rice, Stacey King and Pervis Ellison in for 
individual workouts but not him. The Clips aren't your usual run-of-the-mill 
NBA franchise, though." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Max Mercy. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Wallace Matthews of Newsday, on Mike Weaver's split-decision victory 
over Phil Brown in a dull 12-rounder Thursday night in New York: "The crowd was 
so benumbed by the lack of action that they counted down the final 10 seconds 
and gave the loudest cheer of the night to the final bell."

SUTTON, TEWELL SHARE LEAD IN MICHIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hal Sutton and Doug Tewell, two players trying to end long dry spells, shared 
the lead in Friday's second round of the $1-million Buick Open golf tournament 
at Grand Blanc, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Tewell shot a six-under-par 66, and Sutton had a 68 over the 7,014-yard course 
at Warwick Hills, about 50 miles north of Detroit. They were tied at 
nine-under-par 135. 
</P>
<P>
Tewell, who turns 40 next month, has four tour victories but none since the 
1987 Pensacola Open. Sutton, 31, won both the Tournament Players Championship 
and the PGA title in 1983 but hasn't had a victory since 1986, when he won the 
Phoenix Open and the Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
First-round leader Leonard Thompson, seeking his first PGA Tour victory in 12 
years, was one stroke behind the leaders after a 71, tied with Australian Wayne 
Grady, Mark O'Meara and Joel Edwards. Grady and Edwards shot 69s, and O'Meara 
had a 70. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Lopez and Betsy King, the dominant players on the Ladies Professional 
Golf Assn. tour this year, continued their battle for supremacy in the opening 
round of the $225,000 Atlantic City tournament at Somers Point, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez shot a three-under-par 67 to take a one-stroke lead over King, Elaine 
Crosby and Chris Johnson. Eight players were two shots back. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dent and Gordon Jones shot five-under-par 67s to share the first-round lead 
in the $275,000 Newport Cup tournament at Newport, R.I.. 
</P>
<P>
Al Kelley, a qualifier from Eustis, Fla., shot a 68. Jim Ferree, Jim Cochran 
and Dick Hendrickson were tied at 69.

TOP-SEEDED MAYOTTE ADVANCES TO SEMIFINALS AGAINST WITSKEN

<TEXT>
<P>
Top-seeded Tim Mayotte surrendered only nine points on his serve Friday in a 
6-3, 6-3 victory over Australian Simon Youl to gain the semifinals of the 
Sovran Bank tennis tournament in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Mayotte, ranked No. 11 in the world, won five of his nine service games at love 
in disposing of Youl in 74 minutes. He will next face Todd Witsken, a 4-6, 7-6 
(7-4), 6-3 winner over Jim Grabb. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, Richey Renebert will play Brad Gilbert. Renebert 
advanced with an easy 6-1, 6-1 victory over Ramesh Krishnam, while Gilbert 
struggled to a 6-7 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4 win over Paul Chamberlin. 
</P>
<P>
Mayotte, who has not lost a set in three matches this week, had little 
difficulty against Youl, ranked No. 205. Mayotte, seeking his first tournament 
title of the year, did not allow a point on his serve until he had built a 5-2 
lead in the first set. Youl used his only break of the match to pull within 5-3 
but gave the game right back when he double-faulted on set point. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering I was slow to break in the other matches, I made a point of 
getting out to a quick start today," Mayotte said. "Anything can happen in the 
tiebreaker." 
</P>
<P>
In Schenectady, N.Y., second-seeded Halle Cioffi rallied to defeat Sandra 
Birch, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, in the quarterfinals of the $200,000 OTB International 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In today's semifinals, Cioffi will play Marianne Werdel, who advanced with a 
6-4, 6-1 victory over Stacy Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Gretchen Magers won her quarterfinal match over Ann Henricksson, 
6-4, 6-3. Magers will play eighth-seeded Laura Gildemeister of Peru, who 
defeated Renata Baranski of Poland, 6-4, 6-4.

Chris Washburn played basketball games at North Carolina State while high on 
cocaine and once used a friend's urine sample to pass a drug test at the 
school, according to a new book, "Personal Fouls." 
</P>
<P>
"Wash would play games on coke," a teammate is quoted as saying. "The first 
half, he'd play great, and then the coke would wear off, and in the second half 
he wouldn't do a thing." 
</P>
<P>
The book, written by Peter Golenbock, also claims that N.C. State Coach Jim 
Valvano allowed Washburn to play even though he was flunking most of his 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
Washburn left the school after his sophomore year to turn pro. Last month, he 
was banned from the National Basketball Assn. for repeated drug violations.

NEWSWIRE: WALSH, COWBOYS AGREE TO $4.1-MILLION CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys came to terms with holdout quarterback Steve Walsh Friday 
for a total package of $4.1 million over four years, Coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who decided to pass up his senior year at the University of Miami to 
enter the National Football League's supplemental draft, will join the Cowboys 
in Thousand Oaks today. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys already have quarterback Troy Aikman of UCLA, the No. 1 overall 
pick in the regular draft, in camp, and published reports have indicated that 
Walsh might be traded. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not considering a trade for Steve at this time," Johnson said. "We plan 
for him to be here and competing for the job." 
</P>
<P>
A substantial signing bonus was included in Walsh's contract, but the amount 
was not disclosed. According to the contract, Walsh could be traded to any 
other NFL team in 1989. After 1989, he will give Johnson a list of four teams 
he doesn't wish to be traded to.

ANGEL GAME WILL START AT 7 TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It does not say so on your tickets, or even in the Angel media guide, but 
today's third game of a four-game series at Anaheim Stadium between the Angels 
and the Chicago White Sox will start at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The game was originally scheduled to be nationally televised by NBC at 1 p.m., 
the time indicated on the tickets. But when the Angels were told by network 
officials on July 20 that the game would not be televised, they changed the 
starting time, informing season-ticket holders by mail and publicly announcing 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels always prefer night games to day games on Saturdays because they 
draw bigger crowds, a club spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier for people to get here and it's more comfortable at night," said 
Tom Seeberg, the Angels' vice president of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
NBC will televise two games in the Southland today -- the New York Mets against 
the Chicago Cubs at 10:15 a.m. and the San Francisco Giants against the Houston 
Astros at 1 p.m.

RAIDERS CUT TACKLE JACKSON -- NO. 10 DRAFT PICK

The Raiders cut a draft choice, their first of the 1989 training camp, 
releasing Charles Jackson, a defensive tackle from Jackson State, Friday. He 
was their No. 10 selection. 
</P>
<P>
They also released inside linebacker Eric Snelson, a free agent from Stanford 
who was a starter all last exhibition season in the absence of holdout Matt 
Millen. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have since signed five Plan B free-agent linebackers and seem to be 
most impressed by one of the least-recognized -- Joe Costello, formerly of the 
Atlanta Falcons. Bigger names Jackie Shipp of Miami and Emmanuel King of 
Cincinnati, both former No. 1 picks, are thought to be battling to make the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Former Chicago Bear Otis Wilson, the most famous of the new linebackers, put on 
full pads for the first time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Another projected starting guard got hurt, but not seriously. Newt Harrell, who 
moved up when Dale Hellestrae broke his leg, hyperextended an elbow in 
Thursday's practice against the Cowboys and was held out of Friday afternoon's 
workout. Coach Mike Shanahan says he hopes Harrell will be able to practice in 
pads today. . . . Of the starting secondary, only Stacey Toran worked Friday. 
Mike Haynes' lawyer, Howard Slusher, wanted to take a look at his client's new 
contract before Haynes signed. Vann McElroy has a sore hip. Terry McDaniel, the 
promising cornerback who still must prove he can avoid injuries, has been out 
for a week with a groin pull. MARK HEISLER

RAMS' PANKEY REJOINS TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irv Pankey's holdout ended quickly and quietly Friday afternoon as the Rams' 
left tackle surprised everyone by signing a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
It couldn't have come at a better time for the team, which was facing an 
offensive line crisis. In three days, the Rams will depart for Tokyo and an 
exhibition game against the San Francisco 49ers Aug. 6 (Japan time). Pankey's 
signing gives the team three starters in the line to go with center Doug Smith 
and right tackle Jackie Slater. 
</P>
<P>
Still missing from the line, however, are starting right guard Duval Love, 
tackle Robert Cox and center-guard Tony Slaton. 
</P>
<P>
Details of Pankey's contract weren't revealed, but his agent said that no other 
Ram would make a higher base salary, which would put Pankey in the $450,000 to 
$500,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson said a move would be made today to clear room on the roster 
for Irv Pankey. . . . The Rams still have to sign four veterans -- running back 
Greg Bell, plus offensive linemen Duval Love, Robert Cox and Tony Slaton, and 
their two first-round picks, defensive end Bill Hawkins and running back 
Cleveland Gary. Tight end Damone Johnson is under contract but has not 
reported.CHRIS DUFRESNE

Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran will fight outdoors Dec. 7 at the Mirage 
Hotel in Las Vegas for Leonard's World Boxing Council super-middleweight title, 
Top Rank promoter Bob Arum announced Friday.

The third Leonard-Duran bout was announced earlier in the week, but the date

<P>
"The Mirage people more than satisfied my technical people," Arum said. "The 
fight will take place in a tent-like structure specially insulated from the 
wind."

Leonard, 33, ended his retirement last Nov. 7 by stopping Donny Lalonde for the

SHELLS RAIN ON BEIRUT; 13 DIE IN 'NIGHT OF TERROR'

<P>
Warring Syrian and Christian forces battered Beirut with 50,000 shells and 
rockets overnight, killing 13 people in a random bombardment that one radio 
station called "a night of insane terror." 
</P>
<P>
The eight-hour barrage Thursday and Friday sparked fires that raged out of 
control and gutted scores of warehouses, shops and apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Orange flames blazed against the night sky as residents cowered in basements 
and bomb shelters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like an Earthquake 
</P>
<P>
Almost every neighborhood in the divided capital and the Christian port city of 
Juniyah were hit "as if by a killer earthquake," said a police spokesman. "It 
was Beirut's night of horror and terror." 
</P>
<P>
He said 13 people were killed and 65 were wounded, raising the toll to 494 dead 
and 2,014 injured since the latest fighting erupted March 8 between Lebanese 
army commander Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian troops and an alliance 
of the Syrian army and Druze Muslim militias. 
</P>
<P>
It was the heaviest shelling duel in the four-month confrontation "in terms of 
firepower used and destruction wreaked," said the police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian gunners in West Beirut and northern Lebanon joined forces at 8 p.m. 
Thursday and started blasting Juniyah, East Beirut and the Christian port of 
Byblos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun's forces struck back at Syrian batteries with howitzers, but their allies 
from the Lebanese Forces militia fired an indiscriminate barrage at West 
Beirut. The shelling tapered off at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
People emerged from bunkers and jammed supermarkets, buying food and bottled 
water in anticipation of another bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this apocalypse?" asked Hisham Sinno, a Sunni Muslim grocer whose shop was 
destroyed. "I'm destroyed. I have no source of income left." 
</P>
<P>
"Let them all roast in hell, those who are roasting Beirut!" said Albert Tawil, 
a Christian bank employee in East Beirut. "I wish one day I'll drink their 
blood." 
</P>
<P>
Broken power cables dangled on streets littered with craters and glass shards. 
Hundreds of burned-out cars smoldered. 
</P>
<P>
"A night of insane terror," the Muslim-controlled Voice of the Nation radio 
said of the thunderous duel waged with multi-barreled launchers that fire 40 
rockets a minute. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being killed in our beds. . . . Beirut is being massacred, and no one in 
the Arab world or the outside world seems to care," said an announcer on 
Christian-run Voice of Lebanon, his voice choking with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
One rocket devastated the top floor of the seven-story building housing offices 
of the Associated Press and the U.S. television networks CBS and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
"The explosion blew me out of my bed. I found myself flat on the floor with 
glass shards showering me," said AP correspondent Farouk Nassar, who lives on 
the sixth floor. 
</P>
<P>
The blast shattered windows and hurled pieces of furniture down the street. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. headquarters in West Beirut and the Soviet Embassy compound also took 
direct hits, but police said no casualties were reported. 
</P>
<P>
An electric tools warehouse in West Beirut burned from midnight to midday. Fire 
engines were unable to battle the fire because of a water shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Another exodus followed the bombardment. Police estimated at least 100,000 
residents fled Beirut on Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"What have children done to be butchered like that?" asked one of the refugees, 
Alia Shami, as she loaded the family car. Hundreds of vehicles formed convoys 
carrying frightened civilians to safer areas.

BAILOUT SEEN AS ELIMINATING MANY S&amp;LS, INVITING ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thrift bailout bill approved by a joint congressional committee is a 
landmark piece of legislation that will drastically shrink the nation's savings 
and loan industry and make it far more conservative in its investments, lending 
experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the proposed legislation contains important flaws and does 
not provide nearly enough money to solve the industry's problems once and for 
all, critics say. If they are right, taxpayers may have to open their wallets 
again for what is already the most expensive bailout in U.S. government 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation -- if it is given final congressional approval and is signed by 
President Bush -- will probably put at least 1,000 savings and loan firms -- 
one-third of the industry -- out of business through closures and mergers in 
the years ahead, lending specialists believe. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts predict that the number of thrifts nationwide will fall from 
around 2,950 today to fewer than 2,000 by the mid-1990s, but it may drop as low 
as 1,000, some believe. There were more than 4,000 thrifts in the United States 
when the decade began. 
</P>
<P>
Despite approval by the conference committee Thursday, the bailout bill is not 
out of the woods. After days of negotiating, the Senate's conferees bowed to 
House demands and agreed to a financing plan that will place the cost of the 
bailout on the federal budget. The Senate had wanted an off-budget financing 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Both Senate and House must vote on the package approved by the conferees, and 
Senate opponents of on-budget financing claim to have the votes to defeat the 
bill. Also, the possibility of a presidential veto looms over the controversy. 
Bush has strongly supported the off-budget approach. 
</P>
<P>
But, if the bill finally is approved, it will create a new federal agency known 
as the Resolution Trust Corporation whose job it will be to close or merge 600 
to 700 of the nation's sickest S&amp;Ls as quickly as possible. The corporation 
already is controversial -- and it has not even been formed yet. 
</P>
<P>
Tough new capital standards, aimed at curbing high-risk lending, are expected 
to lead to waves of mergers and acquisitions as strong thrifts gobble up weak 
ones. And, for the first time, the bill allows bank holding companies to buy 
healthy thrifts and convert them into commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
"There is going to be a massive consolidation of the industry," said James B. 
Bemowski, partner in the Los Angeles office of McKinsey &amp; Co., a consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidations do not bode well for consumer pocketbooks. The added 
competition provided by hundreds of failing thrifts -- the ones now targeted 
for liquidation -- meant higher interest rates for deposits and lower rates on 
home loans. 
</P>
<P>
Once those thrifts are closed, rates on deposts will fall and mortgage rates 
will increase, some experts believe. "For the consumer, (the bill) is not 
beneficial for mortgages or deposits," said Robert Adelizzi, president of Home 
Federal Savings &amp; Loan in San Diego.

Retreat From Deregulation 
</P>
<P>
The bill marks a major step back from the deregulation legislation of the early 
1980s that allowed thrifts to make major investments in areas beyond their 
traditional expertise in home mortgage lending. 
</P>
<P>
Those laws, both state and federal, ultimately led to huge losses and the need 
for today's taxpayer-assisted industry bailout, estimated to cost about $166 
billion during the next 10 years. The U.S. taxpayer will foot about 
three-quarters of the cost, and the industry will pay for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The problems have caused a huge crack in the traditionally cozy relationship 
between Congress and the savings and loan industry. Thrift executives found 
lawmakers' doors slammed in their faces after years of access. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being treated like a bunch of scoundrels," complained Patrick H. Price, 
chief executive at San Francisco Federal Savings &amp; Loan and a leading 
industry spokesman in California. "I can't get a congressman to call me back . 
. . . I guess I resent that more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hike in Tangible Capital 
</P>
<P>
The bill has developed a new safety standard that will require thrifts to keep 
cash capital, also known as tangible capital, at 3% of assets. Tangible capital 
is the equivalent of shareholders' equity minus intangible assets known as good 
will. 
</P>
<P>
The bill will require a 1.5% capital standard at first, but regulators will not 
be required to limit the growth of institutions violating the rule until June, 
1991. The 3% rule will take full effect in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
And that will cause real problems for institutions with capital consisting 
largely of good will, the intangible value beyond an S&amp;L's cash and 
physical assets. Currently, the capital requirement is 3% of assets, including 
good will. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bill creates a separate safety standard that varies the level 
of capital according to the risk of the loan. As a result, investments in 
mortgage-backed securities and single-family homes, viewed as safe investments, 
will require less capital than money lent in riskier projects like apartment 
buildings and commercial office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that the cleanup operation will need an additional $20 billion to 
$50 billion to do the job right and say that banking regulators will have to 
return to Congress in two to four years for more money. 
</P>
<P>
"The day the ink is dry on this bill, they're going to have to start working on 
a new one," one former top federal thrift regulator, who asked not to be 
identified, warned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Increase Costs 
</P>
<P>
Executives at healthy thrifts complain that the bill will both increase their 
costs of deposit insurance to help fund the bailout and require them to raise 
more capital. The twin goals are not compatible, they argue, and may even push 
some now-solvent thrifts into insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many experts are forecasting major problems for the 
Resolution Trust Corporation. According to Daniel C. Vladeck, a public interest 
lawyer in Washington, the agency is another scandal waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
The trust corporation -- to come under the general control of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, the insurance system for commercial banks -- 
must undertake an unprecedented effort to manage and sell assets worth $400 
billion to $500 billion that will be taken over from failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the responsibility probably will be subcontracted outside the 
government, because the trust corporation will have just a comparative handful 
of workers for its massive management and disposal job. "With few employees to 
carefully monitor these transactions, this structure is an open-handed 
invitation to abuse," Vladeck said recently. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Amount of Assets 
</P>
<P>
Just the size of those assets, the equivalent of four times the real estate 
value of Rhode Island, will make the trust corporation one of the nation's most 
formidable banking organizations, lending and housing experts point out. 
</P>
<P>
The assets include an estimated $100 billion or more in problem loans and 
properties that are in foreclosure, are delinquent or have inadequate 
collateral. They range from apartments and office buildings to industrial parks 
and raw land. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be extremely difficult (to sell these properties), the 
equivalent of organizing and executing D-Day," said Donald Crocker, a real 
estate liquidation specialist who is president of J. E. Roberts Co. in 
Alexandria, Va. "It is very labor-intensive and takes highly qualified people 
to do it right." 
</P>
<P>
Many worry that the Resolution Trust Corporation will play havoc with local 
real estate markets if it sells assets at fire-sale prices. That could depress 
already depressed markets, particularly in Texas, where about half of the 
problem real estate is situated. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole problem is: Do you get rid of the assets quickly and depress the 
market, or do you hold on to them and let the losses mount?" said Robert Litan, 
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
So complex is the task that many expect the trust corporation to remain in 
business for 5 to 10 years and perhaps even into the next century. "I expect 
them to be a . . . fixture of the Washington landscape for quite a while," 
Litan said. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1980s, thrifts were largely non-controversial lenders whose main job 
was to provide homeowners with low-cost mortgage loans and keep depositors' 
money in government-insured savings accounts. It was a comfortable but 
important business that made home ownership an integral part of the American 
dream and gave thrifts enormous clout with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The relationships started to change early in this decade when soaring interest 
rates drove up deposit costs and drenched thrifts in red ink because most of 
their assets were in fixed-rate mortgage loans. The industry never did recover 
from that experience, which led to total losses of nearly $9 billion in 1981 
and 1982 and several hundred S&amp;L failures. 
</P>
<P>
Although its capital was badly depleted, the industry emerged from the debacle 
with vastly expanded investment powers that took it far afield from mortgage 
lending. This kind of deregulation was supposed to give thrifts other ways to 
make money. Instead, for many, it merely provided other ways to lose money at a 
time they could least afford it. 
</P>
<P>
As the industry enters the 1990s, it faces the prospect of its clout's being 
further eroded because its ranks will be thinned even more. S&amp;Ls in the 
worst shape will be liquidated -- and the depositors paid off -- or merged, 
with regulatory assistance, with healthy thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Healthy Firms May Merge 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of other thrifts also will be merged out of existence, including both 
healthy firms that represent good buys and marginally healthy ones struggling 
to meet the new capital requirements, lending specialists say. Many of the 
acquirers are expected to be commercial banks and large thrifts seeking to 
expand their markets. 
</P>
<P>
Price, the chief executive at San Francisco Federal Savings, estimates that 
only 1,100 to 1,200 thrifts will be in business by the mid-1990s and admits 
there is a good chance that his own financial institution will be acquired by 
an outsider wanting to enter the Northern California banking market. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a 50-50 chance we won't be around (in three to four years)," 
he said. "Not because we failed, but because we have been successful." 
</P>
<P>
Some say the bailout legislation is another step in the inexorable march toward 
elimination of the thrift industry as a separately operated and regulated 
industry. Traditionally, banks have stuck to business loans and thrifts to home 
mortgages, but that distinction has become increasingly blurred in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll be a bank analyst within five years," said Peter Treadway, a 
savings and loan analyst at the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham 
&amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if thrifts do not survive as a separate and distinct industry, there 
certainly will continue to be lending institutions that specialize in 
home-mortgage loans. 
</P>
<P>
"The function will persist, even if the (savings and loan) name doesn't," said 
Jonathan Gray, analyst for the Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. financial firm in 
New York. "Fifteen hundred to 2,000 (thrifts) will continue to operate as they 
always have -- making mortgage loans using customer deposits."

FAMILY'S RIGHTS AT HEART OF 'RIGHT-TO-DIE' QUESTION

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than six years, 32-year-old Nancy Cruzan has lain unconscious, kept 
alive by round-the-clock care and feedings through a tube surgically implanted 
in her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Since Cruzan nearly suffocated in an automobile accident, she has been in a 
"persistent vegetative state," a form of permanent unconsciousness in which she 
is able to breathe on her own. Like thousands of other patients in this 
condition, she has no awareness of herself or her surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Her face is red and bloated; her arms and legs are severely contracted; when 
she is awake, her eyes move randomly in all directions. And she may remain this 
way well into the next century, unless the U.S. Supreme Court decides 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no hope for recovery, Cruzan has a normal life expectancy. 
Her care at a state rehabilitation hospital here costs about $130,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan, like most young accident victims, had not left specific instructions 
about whether she would want to be kept alive indefinitely in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
Her parents, however, armed with strong beliefs about what their daughter would 
want if she could realize her condition, have been fighting a legal battle to 
stop her tube feedings and let her die. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy would not want to live like this," her father, Lester (Joe) Cruzan, said 
in a recent interview at the family's home in Carterville, the small 
southwestern Missouri town where Nancy was born and reared. "The last thing 
that we could do for her is to set her free." 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, Nancy would have died that night, but medicine stepped in 
and pulled her back," said her older sister, Christy White. "So now what we 
would like to see is medicine step out and let her go." 
</P>
<P>
When the Supreme Court announced earlier this month that it would review the 
Missouri Supreme Court decision that Cruzan's feedings must be continued, it 
transformed the anguish of one family into one of the nation's most important 
"right-to-die" cases. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the high court, despite four previous requests, has agreed 
to rule on the circumstances in which medical treatment can be halted, a topic 
that is routinely debated and decided in state courts, state legislatures and 
in hospitals nationwide. The case, Cruzan vs. Director of Missouri Department 
of Health, will be argued this fall. A decision is expected early next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Significant Decision' 
</P>
<P>
If the court makes a broad ruling one way or the other, it likely "will be the 
most significant decision on death and dying and overshadow even the Karen Ann 
Quinlan case," said Alexander M. Capron of the USC Law Center in Los Angeles, 
an expert on medical ethics. 
</P>
<P>
In that landmark 1976 case, the New Jersey Supreme Court granted a father's 
request to remove his comatose daughter from a respirator. The decision -- 
which the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review -- set the stage for a gradual 
expansion of the rights of individuals to determine the course of their medical 
treatment, particularly at the end of life. 
</P>
<P>
The Cruzan case raises anew some of the thorniest questions in medical ethics, 
as well as the role of the federal Constitution in shaping medical practice. 
These questions -- some of which may be resolved by the Supreme Court -- 
include: 
</P>
<P>
* Do patients have a constitutionally protected right to refuse medical 
treatment? If there is such a right, what "right-to-die" issues are still 
subject to state regulation? 
</P>
<P>
* When does the interest of society in preserving life outweigh the right of 
individuals to make decisions about their medical care? 
</P>
<P>
* Do families and physicians have the right to make medical decisions for 
permanently unconscious patients whose wishes about medical treatment are not 
known? 
</P>
<P>
* Can medical treatments be stopped for patients such as Cruzan, who are 
permanently unconscious, even if they are not terminally ill? If treatments are 
stopped, is the patient's death the result of the condition that caused the 
unconsciousness, or a form of euthanasia? 
</P>
<P>
* Are food and water administered through a stomach tube or a vein a type of 
medical treatment, similar to breathing machines or kidney dialysis, that can 
be stopped and started? Or are food and water more basic care that must always 
be given to patients? 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the Cruzan case is the interpretation of individual liberty as 
set forth in the Constitution. According to Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law 
School, the case centers on "the right to resist force-feeding in accord with 
one's own previously expressed wishes" and on the right not to "force-feed or 
otherwise artificially sustain the life of an intimate relative." 
</P>
<P>
Tribe, author of the 1988 treatise, "American Constitutional Law," said the 
case might allow the high court, outside of the bitter abortion controversy, to 
"address the fundamental question of how far the liberty clause of the 14th 
Amendment goes in protecting rights that are not explicitly stated in the 
Constitution." The 14th Amendment says in part that no state shall "deprive any 
person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." According to 
Tribe, the use of the term "liberty" in the 5th and 14th amendments is the 
basis of the widely discussed -- and disputed -- constitutional right of 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Issues 
</P>
<P>
On July 3, the day the Supreme Court announced that it would hear the Cruzan 
case, it also upheld a Missouri law restricting abortions and agreed to hear 
three new abortion cases. While some observers are struck by the parallels 
between abortion and death and dying cases, attorneys on both sides of the 
Cruzan case caution that many of the issues are quite different. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion cases involve the competing rights of mother and fetus. The Cruzan 
case involves a woman who is permanently unconscious, has no dependents and, 
unlike a fetus, "has no potentiality ahead of her," said William H. Colby, a 
Kansas City attorney representing the Cruzan family. 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri case began in the early morning hours of Jan. 11, 1983, when 
Cruzan, then 25, was driving home from her job in a cheese-processing factory. 
</P>
<P>
She lost control of her 1963 Rambler. It crashed and overturned. Cruzan, who 
was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown clear, landing face down in a field. 
</P>
<P>
The state trooper who arrived first examined the young woman and believed she 
was dead. About 15 minutes after the accident, paramedics arrived. They quickly 
turned Cruzan over and resuscitated her, restoring her respiration and 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irreversible Brain Damage 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan never regained consciousness after the accident. Her physicians 
concluded that she had suffered irreversible brain damage when her airway was 
obstructed during the time she had been face down. As a result of the lack of 
oxygen, her brain later atrophied and filled with fluid. 
</P>
<P>
The part of the brain that controls voluntary behavior and consciousness was 
destroyed but the brain stem, which controls breathing and other reflex 
behaviors, was not. This differs from "brain death," when the entire brain 
ceases to function. 
</P>
<P>
In February, when the extent of permanent brain damage was still uncertain, 
Cruzan's parents and her then-husband authorized her physicians to surgically 
implant a feeding tube into her stomach. Later, the probate court in nearby 
Carthage, Mo., approved a divorce and appointed her parents as her guardians. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 19, 1983, Cruzan was moved here to the Missouri Rehabilitation Center, 
where she remains today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Awareness 
</P>
<P>
A reporter recently visited the hospital with Thad C. McCanse, a Carthage 
attorney appointed by the probate court to represent Cruzan's interests during 
the case. Her sunny private room was adorned with cards and stuffed animals 
from family members. Lying in bed wearing a bright floral nightgown, she made 
indistinct noises and moved her arms but appeared to have no awareness of 
either her nurse or her visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the family had hopes for Cruzan's recovery. They became active in a 
head injury support group. But gradually, in mid-1986, they realized that she 
was not going to get better. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, her parents reached a decision to seek the removal of her feeding tube. 
"I read everything I could get my hands on," said Joe Cruzan, a sheet metal 
worker. "We began to focus on what would be her wishes. . . . She would be 
horrified at her existence now." 
</P>
<P>
Before the accident, Cruzan had several general conversations about death. 
According to court records, in one "somewhat serious conversation" with a 
friend she indicated that if sick or injured she would not want to go on living 
unless she could live at least "halfway normally." But she never had specific 
discussions with her family covering her current situation. As a result, the 
family relied on its sense of her "values." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fiercely Independent 
</P>
<P>
During a two-hour interview, her parents and older sister described Nancy 
Cruzan as a fiercely independent, upbeat young woman who was much loved by 
family and friends. They said she particularly enjoyed animals, children, 
holidays and the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of it stems from who she was before the accident. She was so vibrant, 
so vital, so alive," her sister Christy explained. 
</P>
<P>
The Cruzans anticipated that a court order would be necessary to discontinue 
the feeding tube. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Society for the Right to Die, a New York-based advocacy group, 
Missouri and four other states have laws prohibiting the withholding of tube 
feedings. In contrast, 10 states have laws specifically authorizing physicians, 
in consultation with patients and their families, to withdraw food and water in 
certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1986, the Cruzans set in motion the protracted series of events 
leading to the court case. They contacted the Society for the Right to Die, 
which has assisted many other families in similar circumstances. Through the 
Kansas City chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, they were put in 
touch with Colby, of the firm Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon, who is representing 
them without charge. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1987, the hospital denied their formal request to stop the 
feedings. In October, they asked their county probate court to intervene. In 
March, 1988, a three-day trial was held in the county courthouse at Carthage. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Circuit Judge Charles E. Teel Jr. ruled for the family. He held that 
Missouri's 1985 Life Support Declarations Act -- which prohibits the 
withholding of artificial feedings -- violated Cruzan's federal constitutional 
rights to decline medical treatment, including nutrition and hydration. 
</P>
<P>
The case was appealed directly to the state Supreme Court. In November, 1988, 
that court, in a 4-3 decision, reversed the trial court and upheld the state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
The majority opinion expressed "grave doubts as to the applicability of privacy 
rights to decisions to terminate the provision of food and water to an 
incompetent patient." It also discounted the significance of Cruzan's general 
statements about death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Err on Side of Life' 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri court held that "the burden of continuing the provision of food 
and water" was "emotionally substantial for Nancy's loved ones," but not for 
her. In the face of "the uncertainty of Nancy's wishes and her own right to 
life," it concluded: "We chose to err on the side of life, respecting the 
rights of incompetent persons who may wish to live despite a severely 
diminished quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the Cruzan case, it had 
captured the attention of "right-to-life" and "right-to-die" advocacy groups 
and leading medical organizations. 
</P>
<P>
This is because the Missouri Supreme Court decision clashed with nearly all 
similar decisions by courts in other states, including Arizona, California, 
Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island. Many of these 
courts had upheld on constitutional grounds the withholding of various forms of 
medical treatment, including food and water, from patients in a persistent 
vegetative state. 
</P>
<P>
These decisions likened tube and intravenous feedings to other medical 
interventions, not to the routine provision of nursing care or comfort. In a 
widely cited 1986 Florida case, an appellate court allowed the removal of a 
nasal feeding tube from a 75-year-old woman in a persistent vegetative state, 
ruling that her constitutional rights to decline treatment took precedence over 
a state law prohibiting the removal of such feedings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California Case 
</P>
<P>
California law does not specifically mention artificial feedings, although 
local and appellate courts have upheld the withdrawal of such feedings. For 
example, in a 1988 case similar to the Cruzan case, an appellate court 
authorized a relative to order disconnection of the nasal feeding tube that had 
sustained a 45-year-old San Jose man since a 1983 auto accident. Both the state 
Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case. The man, 
William Drabick, died after the tube was removed. 
</P>
<P>
Against this legal backdrop, "right-to-life" organizations were thrilled by the 
Missouri Supreme Court's decision. According to James Bopp Jr. of Terre Haute, 
Ind., general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee, the decision 
made clear that there is no constitutional right to "starve to death" the 
medically dependent and disabled, including vegetative-state patients. 
</P>
<P>
But leading medical groups, such as the American Medical Assn., the American 
Academy of Neurology, and the Missouri State Medical Assn., were sharply 
critical. They said the Missouri court had rejected many clearly stated 
principles of medical ethics, such as shared decision-making for incompetent 
patients by physicians and families and the AMA's widely accepted 1986 
statement that "it is not unethical to discontinue all means of life-prolonging 
medical treatment" for patients in irreversible comas, including artificial 
feedings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Family Has No Control' 
</P>
<P>
Unless the person has left clear written directives, "We have a decision in 
Missouri that once you become unconscious . . . the family has no control over 
your medical treatment," said Colby, who represents Cruzan's family. "Your 
doctor has no control over your medical treatment and, if you read the opinion 
literally, you simply have to accept all medical treatment possible." 
</P>
<P>
Colby's interpretation "is just wrong," said Robert Presson, the Missouri 
assistant attorney general who has argued the case for the state. Presson said 
the Missouri court had issued a more limited and "flexible" opinion that does 
not "categorically rule out the withdrawal of food and water" from patients. 
But, in Cruzan's circumstance, "they didn't find it justified." 
</P>
<P>
Already, however, the impact of the state Supreme Court's decision is being 
felt throughout Missouri, according to Gerald Sill, senior vice president of 
the Missouri Hospital Assn. Previously, there were "many instances" in the 
state where food and water were withdrawn from patients similar to Cruzan, Sill 
said. "Now, I feel confident that this has stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Legal scholars are uncertain how the U.S. Supreme Court is likely to approach 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Tribe, of the Harvard Law School, said that a "bare majority" of the court 
might come down on the side of individual liberties and set forth broad 
constitutional limits on the power of state and local officials to override 
medical decisions. But he added that it is "quite plausible and to some degree 
more likely" that the high court will use the case to further restrict 
constitutionally protected privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
"They might leave it to the states to remain 50 laboratories of competing 
approaches to this issue," he said. " . . . I certainly sympathize with both 
the individual and the family who say forcing us to keep this person alive is a 
profound intrusion, but it doesn't follow from that that it violates the 
federal Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
USC's Capron said it is possible to see a compromise decision or one "going 
either way." For example, Capron said the court might affirm a constitutional 
right of Americans to make decisions about their personal health care, 
including the withdrawal of artificial feedings, while at the same time finding 
insufficient evidence to reverse the Missouri Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Cruzans hope for a clear-cut decision that will let their daughter die. 
Visiting Nancy is "not that emotional, wrenching thing anymore that it used to 
be," Joe Cruzan said. "It isn't my daughter (at the hospital). My daughter's 
been gone for over 6 1/2 years and that is just what is left of her."

EXXON DUCKS COMMITTAL TO CLEANUP PLAN;

<P>
Under intense prodding by members of Congress, a top Exxon executive declined 
Friday to commit his firm to follow an Alaskan oil spill cleanup plan not yet 
drafted by the government, but he promised that Exxon "will put it right" in 
the oil-fouled area. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bush warned Exxon not to break its pledge to clean up the 
devastating spill, saying that he was pleased with the work accomplished so far 
but would take action if the company left the scene "prematurely." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon U.S.A. President William D. Stevens told a House subcommittee that the 
company plans to halt cleanup efforts during the harsh Alaskan winter. But, he 
said, the firm will return to Alaska in the spring to help survey remaining 
environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
The oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 
March, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil into the water and fouling 
beaches and marine environments throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the House Interior subcommittee on water, power and 
offshore energy resources, Stevens carefully hedged promises of future action 
by the firm in response to a detailed cleanup plan to be devised by the U.S. 
Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
"My expectation, based on past experiences, is that there will be no 
differences of view" that would cause Exxon to reject the plan, he said. If the 
company balked at the proposals, the government could take over the cleanup 
effort and try to bill Exxon for the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"We will follow through on any reasonable request," Stevens assured members of 
the House subcommittee. But he stopped short of pledging that the company would 
accept the government's cleanup blueprint before it is complete. 
</P>
<P>
"Exxon's decision to comply or not is theirs to make," observed Rep. George 
Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of the subcommittee. "The Coast Guard is in the 
position of the public trust at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's comments came as Exxon and the federal government are debating whether 
the cleanup could be substantially accomplished before mid-September, when 
stormy weather conditions could halt most work in the affected area. 
</P>
<P>
A July 19 internal Exxon memo from Otto R. Harrison, the company's cleanup 
supervisor, warned that Exxon would demobilize its cleanup crews for the winter 
and "our only commitment for the spring of 1990 is to survey the shorelines." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warns Against Commitments 
</P>
<P>
In the directive to Exxon employees managing the cleanup, Harrison said: "No 
commitment should be made to any private or government party on timing of 
demobilization, for winter activity or for 1990 activity." 
</P>
<P>
"The wording of Mr. Harrison's memo was unfortunate," Stevens told the House 
panel. "What we're doing every day . . . would say we will follow through." 
</P>
<P>
After months of cleanup efforts that have cost Exxon $675 million, Stevens 
said, about 600 of 725 miles of coastline affected by the spill have been 
cleaned enough to render them "environmentally stable." 
</P>
<P>
But those claims came under attack by Rep. Wayne Owens (D-Utah), who brandished 
oil-soaked rocks taken recently from a beach that had been cleaned, and from 
Dennis D. Kelso, Alaska's commissioner of environmental conservation. 
</P>
<P>
"The job's not done, and I think you're doing it in the wrong way," said Owens. 
"There's restoration here as well as cleanup. And that job hasn't been 
started." 
</P>
<P>
But the Coast Guard, the agency designated to judge the adequacy of Exxon's 
efforts, appeared willing to compromise on holding Exxon to the stricter 
standard of environmental restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll ever see it immaculately clean and restored to the 
pristine condition it had been in," said Vice Adm. Clyde T. Lusk Jr., vice 
commander of the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
When scientists and engineers return in the spring to survey remaining 
environmental damage, Lusk said, "we will probably find some scientists will 
tell us that further cleanup will do more environmental harm than good." 
</P>
<P>
While Stevens said that Exxon currently has no detailed winter demobilization 
plan, he defended the expected withdrawal of large ships and equipment from the 
spill area in mid-September. Wind speeds above 40 knots and waves over six 
meters high begin occurring regularly in September and would threaten the 
safety of workers and equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon is to present a demobilization plan to Coast Guard Adm. Clyde Robbins by 
Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
But Kelso, the Alaska environmental official, said that the cleanup could 
proceed in some affected areas well into the fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
Some equipment and personnel must be available in case winds and tides begin 
blowing large oil deposits into unaffected or previously cleaned areas, Kelso 
said.

ANTI-ALLIANCE SPEECH BLOWS UP IN NEW ZEALAND LEADER'S FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
WELLINGTON, New Zealand 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A strange thing happened to New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange after he 
returned from a trip to the United States earlier this year: He found his 
government in an uproar and his popularity down to the lowest level ever. 
</P>
<P>
Lange had traveled to Yale University to deliver the George Herbert Walker Jr. 
lecture, named -- ironically, as it turned out -- for President Bush's 
grandfather. There, in an otherwise mundane review of New Zealand's relations 
with the United States, Lange dropped a bombshell. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some concern from the United States that New Zealand might try 
and pretend that we have edged back to what is referred to as 'business as 
usual,' " Lange said. "To ensure that there is no misunderstanding, I think it 
best to say clearly that as between the United States and New Zealand, the 
security alliance is a dead letter." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treaty Undermined 
</P>
<P>
The alliance Lange mentioned is the ANZUS Treaty, signed in 1952 by the United 
States, Australia and New Zealand, which had already been undermined by Lange's 
decision to ban from New Zealand's ports ships carrying nuclear weapons. The 
United States will not confirm or deny that any of its vessels carry nuclear 
weapons, so U.S. Navy ships simply stopped calling at New Zealand ports. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Wellington, government ministers protested that they were not consulted 
before Lange's Yale speech. In the press, one newspaper commented that there 
had been a "conspicuous failure of communication" and that the prime minister 
had "shot himself in the foot." 
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll showed that popular support for Lange's Labor Party, which won 
the 1987 election with a healthy majority, had fallen to just 30% and that the 
opposition National Party was supported by 63% of those polled. 
</P>
<P>
Lange's personal popularity dropped to 11%, the lowest level recorded for a 
prime minister since poll taking began after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bolt From the Blue' 
</P>
<P>
"It came like a bolt from the blue; people were just bewildered," said Donald 
C. McKinnon, deputy leader of the National Party. 
</P>
<P>
If New Zealand was surprised by Lange's words, Washington reacted furiously. 
The Bush Administration regarded it as a personal insult to the President that 
Lange had used Bush's alma mater and a lecture funded by his grandfather to 
attack the ANZUS alliance. Lange was not invited to visit Washington, while 
McKinnon, who was in Washington on a private visit at the time, was welcomed 
with open arms at the State Department and the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Lange poured fuel on the fire by joking that he preferred not to visit the 
White House because of the "bums" who were invited there. This further enraged 
the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Just a year earlier, Secretary of State George P. Shultz had put a seal on the 
sour relations with New Zealand by remarking that "we part as friends, but we 
part." At the United Nations, Shultz received the foreign ministers of every 
country in attendance but four -- Iran, Libya, Nicaragua and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
For the 3.5 million fiercely independent and proud people of New Zealand, it 
was an unsavory rebuff. After all, this is a parliamentary democracy, and its 
people greatly admire the United States. Many thought they deserved better 
treatment. Britain, too, has stopped sending warships to New Zealand because of 
the ban on nuclear weapons, but relations have not become as strained with 
London. 
</P>
<P>
The ANZUS fiasco -- Lange said later that it had been cooked up by the media in 
New Zealand to embarrass him -- is only the latest in a series of problems 
facing Lange after five years in office. Indeed, if the opinion polls are any 
guide, Labor will lose handily to the National Party in elections scheduled for 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Lange fired Finance Minister Roger Douglas, formerly one of his 
closest confidants, because of the unforeseen strictures the country endured 
during a period of economic liberalization. Unemployment soared from virtually 
nothing to 10%. The minister of agriculture went so far as to advise farmers to 
think about going on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Lange's popularity also has been damaged recently by a dramatic rise in racial 
tension between New Zealand's whites and its 400,000 citizens of Polynesian 
origin, known as Maori. Lange's government has agreed to settle land claims 
arising from an 1840 treaty with the Maori, and this has caused a severe 
backlash among the whites. 
</P>
<P>
Lange's current woes were symbolized by a photograph on the cover of the local 
edition of Time magazine, which showed Lange lying supine in the grass. Lange 
protested that the photo was several years old, but many New Zealanders 
regarded the controversy as another example of the kind of troubles now dogging 
their leader. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sort of sullen mood," said Mike Moore, minister for external trade 
and the No. 3 man in government. "Governments get themselves in positions where 
they can't do anything right. For a long time, we couldn't do anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, more people seemed concerned about the timing of the ANZUS speech than 
about what it actually said. By coincidence, the speech was delivered on ANZAC 
day, when Australia and New Zealand honor their war dead. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's anti-nuclear stand is supported by voters across a broad spectrum 
and is regarded as more of an environmental issue than as an aspect of the Cold 
War. The primary concern is radioactive fallout from nuclear testing by 
countries such as France in the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paradox in Opinion Polls 
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls have shown that up to 70% of the public support the government's 
anti-nuclear position. Paradoxically, 70% also support ANZUS, which may help 
account for Lange's decline in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Even the National Party does not suggest overturning the ban imposed on ships 
carrying nuclear weapons. But it has said that the United States would respect 
New Zealand's wishes in this regard. Party leader James Bolger quipped that he 
trusts the United States more than Lange. 
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts speculated that Lange made the ANZUS speech to 
galvanize the disorganized Labor Party into action in preparation for next 
year's election. There was also some talk that Lange was attempting to get 
support for a plan to buy four frigates, arguing that because New Zealand had 
no one looking after its defenses, it would have to do so itself. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, relations with the United States are frozen in a state of 
non-cooperation, although trade and economic relations have not been affected 
by the ANZUS dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do U.S. ships no longer call at New Zealand ports, Washington has 
banned all defense cooperation, including military exercises, downgraded New 
Zealand from ally status, suspended ANZUS security guarantees and lowered the 
level of contacts at ambassadorial and ministerial levels. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand warships visiting Hawaii these days must stop at commercial piers 
instead of U.S. naval facilities. The New Zealand government still lets U.S. 
naval aircraft bring supplies to the small U.S. station at Christchurch that 
provides services to American facilities in Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone from a very substantial relationship to a much-attenuated 
relationship," one official said.

U.S. PROBE FOCUSES ON ALLEGED SPY PAYMENTS TO BLOCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. investigators have begun to unravel a chain of evidence pointing toward 
what they believe are large amounts of money received by suspended State 
Department official Felix S. Bloch for his alleged spying for the Soviet Union, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, investigators said the inquiry has been expanded to include 
other diplomatic personnel, particularly those who worked with Bloch during his 
foreign assignments in Austria, East Germany and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Examining the activities of colleagues is standard procedures in such 
investigations, but it is being pursued with particular intensity in the Bloch 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"There is obvious concern that he may have pulled others in with him," said one 
source. 
</P>
<P>
Another official said, "Under the circumstances, we'd be remiss if we didn't 
look at other possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
According to officials familiar with the Bloch inquiry, there is as yet no firm 
evidence of involvement by others. But one senior Administration source said: 
"We now believe that he is not the only one (spying for the Soviet Union). 
There are heavy suspicions that there are others, perhaps but not necessarily 
associated with Bloch." 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, 54, a 30-year Foreign Service officer, has been suspended from his job 
as head of the State Department office that deals with the European Economic 
Community. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have said they suspect he supplied sensitive information to the 
Soviets for about 15 years, a period in which he was a diplomatic officer in 
the U.S. Mission in East Germany and later the No. 2 official in the U.S. 
Embassy in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Enough evidence has not been compiled to arrest Bloch, who has been staying at 
his father's apartment in Manhattan and a daughter's home in suburban 
Westchester County, N.Y., since news of the inquiry was disclosed last week. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials said that they are focusing on financial inducements as 
perhaps the chief motive for his alleged spying activities. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said investigators are in the initial stages of tracking down foreign 
accounts or assets that could have been used to hide large payments that 
continued over many years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a process of looking under rocks for the evidence," said one Bush 
Administration official. "We've begun to find the rocks." 
</P>
<P>
Bloch has refused to cooperate with the investigation. The New York Times 
reported in its Friday editions that Bloch, after he was allegedly videotaped 
passing a briefcase to a suspected Soviet agent in Paris last month, told FBI 
agents that he had been working with the Soviets for many years and had 
received "a lot of money" from them. The report said he refused to elaborate or 
cooperate further after that brief interview. 
</P>
<P>
However, a government official with knowledge of the investigation said Friday 
that he does not believe Bloch ever made significant admissions to the agents. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that without a confession from Bloch, tracing money received 
from alleged spying activities could be crucial to making a criminal case 
against him. Even if espionage charges could not be supported, financial 
records could provide enough evidence for a tax evasion case, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch's 1989 financial disclosure forms filed with the State Department show 
that he and his wife, Lucille, had investments in stock and bond mutual funds 
worth at least $478,000 and perhaps as much as $1.3 million. Government 
disclosure forms require only that assets be reported within certain broad 
ranges, so a more precise estimate of Bloch's net worth is not possible. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they have more than $200,000 in equity in a luxury condominium in 
Washington's fashionable Kalorama neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
While substantial, the holdings do not appear to be beyond what a senior 
Foreign Service officer from an affluent family might have amassed. Bloch's 
father owned a New York paper exporting business before his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
As investigators are seeking evidence of other possible assets, several U.S. 
agencies are attempting to determine what confidential information could have 
been passed to the Soviets by someone in Bloch's high-ranking position. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agencies are being asked to go through their records to see what 
sensitive material passed through Austria between 1980 and 1987 during Bloch's 
assignment in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department, Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies specifically have 
been asked by investigators to cull their files for anything specifically 
earmarked for Bloch's office. Senior U.S. sources predicted that the process of 
assembling and evaluating the information could take weeks, if not months. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have said that they do not know what might have been in the 
briefcase Bloch passed to the suspected Soviet agent in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Ronald J. Ostrow and David Lauter contributed to this 
story.

EXILED STUDENT SEES NEW HOPE FOR CHINA 
</P>

<P>
Standing before a towering replica of the Goddess of Democracy, the statue 
built by students in Beijing as a symbol of their quest for greater liberties, 
student leader Wuer Kaixi fixed his audience with an intense, doleful gaze. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say the democracy movement of 1989 is over," he said. "Some say 
China is hopeless at the moment. I want to say the hope is just beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the statue that students patterned after the Statue of Liberty and 
that the military destroyed in its bloody crackdown on student protesters last 
month, Wuer told 600 Chinese students Friday in Chicago, "I believe we will be 
united and we will erect a Goddess of Democracy (again) on Tian An Men Square 
someday." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lectured Li Peng 
</P>
<P>
Wuer, one of the fugitive students most wanted by the Chinese authorities for 
his role in organizing the student revolt in Beijing, first came to the 
attention of Americans when television cameras captured him, weak from a hunger 
strike, lecturing Premier Li Peng in a meeting during the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The charismatic 21-year-old brought that same seriousness of purpose to Chicago 
on Friday. Under heavy guard, their movements cloaked in secrecy, Wuer and five 
other organizers of the Chinese protests are here this weekend to attend what 
is being called the "First Congress of Chinese Students in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
It is an organizational meeting of more than 600 activists from 200 colleges 
nationwide who want to lobby the U.S. government, raise funds and establish a 
radio station and newspaper to carry the pro-democracy message to the people of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Wuer was one of the handful of student leaders who escaped China after the 
military crackdown June 3-4 in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people 
reportedly were killed. Many of the leaders fled to Hong Kong and later to 
Paris and are now are working to rally support for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the three-day conference, the students received videotaped 
messages of support from Illinois Sens. Paul Simon and Alan J. Dixon, both 
Democrats who have supported the students' movement in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Wuer also exchanged vows of support with Hubert Romanowski, the U.S. 
representative of the Polish Solidarity movement, who attended the conference. 
Afterward, the student leader said they agreed to hold a formal meeting to 
discuss what Romanowski described as their common struggle against government 
oppression. 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference, Wuer, speaking through an interpreter, said the goal of 
the democracy movement is not to overthrow the Chinese Communist Party but to 
obtain for the Chinese people the right to choose what type of government they 
want to live under. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never said . . . we are going to overthrow communism," he said. "I have 
been repeatedly emphasizing that the primary thing we would do is give the 
people the right to choose." 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about whether the movement might eventually join the 
Chinese government, as the Polish Solidarity movement has done in Poland, Wuer 
said: "First of all, we have to struggle for the right of people to choose. As 
for the question of whether we will join the government or whether we will be 
the government, that is something for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Wuer and Yan Jaiqi, former director of the Political Science Institute of the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, were kept in seclusion after arriving in 
Chicago on Wednesday because of concern for their safety, according to Minxin 
Pei, a Harvard University student and spokesman for the conference. 
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese students at universities in the United States have faced 
harassment from Chinese officials, including threats because of pro-democracy 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rumors of Taiwan Meeting 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's news conference, Wuer also denied rumors that he met formally with 
a representative of the Taiwanese government to enlist Taiwan's aid. He 
declined to say whether they might hold informal meetings. 
</P>
<P>
China has claimed that Taiwanese agents helped instigate the student protests. 
</P>
<P>
"To us, anyone who opposes dictatorship is our friend," said Li Lu, another of 
the student-leaders-in-exile attending the conference. "Those who support it, 
our enemy."

Chinese newspapers said Friday that 12 more soldiers have been named "Defenders

June, bringing to 22 the number awarded the title.

An order signed by top leader Deng Xiaoping praised the 12 for bravery in

during the army assault on Tian An Men Square, the People's Daily said.

HONDURAS SAYS IT WILL PUSH TO DISBAND CONTRAS

This Central American nation will forge ahead with a plan for the disbanding of 
U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contras despite President Bush's insistence that the 
rebel army not be demobilized until there is democracy in Nicaragua, a senior 
official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We respect the point of view of the U.S. government, but President (Jose) 
Azcona (Hoyo) has expressed very clearly that he will follow his own 
interests," Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The 12,000 Contras camped in eastern Honduras should leave "as soon as 
possible," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Azcona said Wednesday that he will present a plan for the rapid demobilization 
of the Contras at a Central American peace summit scheduled for Aug. 5-7 in 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
The Honduran plan was drawn up under terms of an agreement reached at a Central 
American presidential summit last February which called for the rebels' ouster 
from Honduras in exchange for political reforms leading to free elections in 
Nicaragua in February, 1990.

Lopez said Honduras "eulogizes and supports" a resolution approved unanimously 
Thursday by the U.N. Security Council, including the United States, calling for 
demobilization of the Contras as part of a pacification process in Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
But in press reports Friday, Bush was quoted as saying that he had telephoned 
Azcona to assure him of continued U.S. support in the face of rising domestic 
pressure to dismantle the Contra army. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he is determined to see to it that the rebel forces would not be 
demobilized until there was genuine democracy in Nicaragua, the editors of the 
U.S. publication Conservative Digest told reporters after an interview with the 
President on Thursday.

INDIA TO BEGIN WITHDRAWING ITS TROOPS FROM SRI LANKA TODAY 
</P>

<P>
India and Sri Lanka on Friday defused a potentially bloody crisis in an 
11th-hour agreement to begin withdrawing 45,000 Indian army troops from the 
island today, the deadline Sri Lanka had set for all troops to leave its 
war-torn northern regions. 
</P>
<P>
The two countries, separated by just 21 miles of water off India's southern 
tip, also agreed to begin discussions in New Delhi today on a timetable for a 
complete troop pullout. 
</P>
<P>
As the two governments were involved in intensive negotiations to resolve the 
conflict, rioting broke out in the central city of Kandy. About 130 
demonstrators were killed when police opened fire during anti-Indian rallies 
that took place despite a strict nationwide curfew, military officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
No violence was reported in the capital city of Colombo, which has resembled a 
ghost town since the curfew went into effect at midnight Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Many other civilians reportedly were killed elsewhere in the countryside, where 
the Sinhalese insurgent movement, the People's Liberation Front, is growing in 
strength, in part by encouraging nationalist hatred for the Indian 
"peacekeeping force." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to his nation of 16 million Friday night, Sri Lankan President 
Ranasinghe Premadasa called India's pledge "an exemplary action," and Aftab 
Seth, a Foreign Ministry spokesman in New Delhi, hailed the agreement as "the 
victory of reason." 
</P>
<P>
However, the accord stopped far short of Premadasa's demand last month that 
India remove by today all troops it sent to Sri Lanka two years ago in an 
ill-fated effort to put down an uprising by Sri Lanka's minority Tamil 
community. 
</P>
<P>
India, which helped train and arm the Tamils in the early 1980s, had been asked 
to dispatch the troops by Premadasa's predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
Premadasa, a professed nationalist whose popularity has waned since his 
election last year, stunned India on June 1 with his unilateral withdrawal 
demand, which was publicly rejected by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sri Lankan president also indicated he is aware that the diplomatic 
tussle with India, a nation with an army 50 times larger than his, is hardly 
his major problem. 
</P>
<P>
During his speech Friday night, Premadasa called on his nation to launch "a 
massive peace effort" to quell a second and far more threatening 
counterinsurgency by the island's Sinhalese ethnic majority. 
</P>
<P>
"By resorting to strikes and various destructive activities . . . we are 
causing damage and great harm to ourselves," Premadasa said. About 40 people 
are killed each day in the conflict on this once-idyllic island, where the 
economy now is crippled. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the appeal, independent analysts and diplomats said Premadasa's 
seven-month-old government clearly showed signs Friday of increasing 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
In signing the agreement, Premadasa backed down from almost all his original 
demands of India. And, to keep peace on the streets Friday, he was forced to 
impose a strict, 54-hour curfew on the entire country. 
</P>
<P>
"Premadasa may have saved a bit of face in signing this agreement today," said 
one Western diplomat who asked not to be named. "But, for him, the real crisis 
is still right in his own backyard. Now that he's settled with the Indians, he 
must face his own people. And that's a problem that won't go away so easily."

BROKE RULES TO AID SEN. D'AMATO, EX-HUD OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A former regional director of the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
testified Friday that he endorsed a list of five rent subsidy projects 
requested by Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) without proper documentation and 
in violation of HUD rules. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, Joseph Monticciolo, estimated that at least half of the HUD 
decisions involving Section 8 moderate rehabilitation projects were made on a 
political basis instead of on their merits. 
</P>
<P>
Section 8 subsidies for 380 of the 655 units sought by D'Amato in March, 1987, 
were approved by top HUD officials the next month, congressional sources said. 
Of those units, 250 were in Puerto Rico and the remaining 130 were in two 
communities in Upstate New York, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"You were working hand in glove with Sen. D'Amato on the 'mod rehab' list," 
Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.) told Monticciolo, who was head of the HUD 
region that included New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 
from 1981 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing more political than this," said Rep. Christopher Shays 
(R-Conn.). 
</P>
<P>
Monticciolo, who got his HUD post with D'Amato's support and later hired one of 
the senator's former top aides to be his executive assistant at HUD, agreed 
that he supported the subsidies requested on what a HUD memo termed "Sen. 
D'Amato's list." 
</P>
<P>
The memo, written by former HUD Assistant Secretary Thomas T. Demery, said that 
there was "no record of a PHA (public housing authority) application on file" 
for any of D'Amato's requests. Under HUD rules for rent subsidy grants, 
requests were supposed to originate with local public housing authorities. 
</P>
<P>
However, previous testimony at hearings of the House Government Operations 
subcommittee on employment and housing has indicated that public housing 
authorities often submitted applications after decisions were made on 
earmarking of government funds for favored developers who had hired Republican 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from D'Amato's office on Monticciolo's testimony 
or the HUD memo indicating for the first time that a GOP senator apparently had 
benefited from top-level contacts within the housing agency. 
</P>
<P>
Monticciolo, who seemed to contradict himself at times during four hours of 
testimony, acknowledged also that, while at HUD, he made recommendations 
favorable to developers who are now his partners in a private business that 
pays him $125,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he arranged the formation of the business, Eagle Capital Group 
Ltd., during his final weeks as HUD regional director by contacting a New York 
developer, Sheldon Goldstein. As a result, Monticciolo said, he did not have to 
put up any money in return for his salary and a 15% ownership interest in the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a quid pro quo," Shays said. "I expect the attorney general's office 
to look at this. You've cashed in." 
</P>
<P>
However, Monticciolo said that his recommendations regarding HUD actions that 
eventually benefited Goldstein and others were not decisive because HUD in 
Washington had the final say. 
</P>
<P>
But Shays argued that the New York developers made a "phenomenal profit" from 
actions taken by Monticciolo involving their acquisition of HUD-owned 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
"I made recommendations to Washington that ultimately benefited individuals who 
are now my partners," the witness acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
He said also that a Puerto Rican developer who benefited from HUD subsidies 
administered by the New York regional office is now his partner in an apartment 
project. While in his HUD post, Monticciolo said, he approved the relocation of 
the San Juan HUD office to a building owned by the same developer. 
</P>
<P>
Monticciolo said that Deborah Gore Dean, the former top assistant to ex-HUD 
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., once recommended a private consultant, Los 
Angeles lawyer Thomas R. Broussard, for housing work in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Dean exercised considerable influence on the allocation of rent subsidies under 
the Section 8 program, which was designed to provide incentives for the 
rehabilitation of housing for low- and moderate-income renters. 
</P>
<P>
The former HUD regional official said that he met once with Broussard 
concerning 300 units available for rehabilitation in Puerto Rico and said that 
Broussard went there "to make his services available." 
</P>
<P>
Broussard, contacted by telephone, said only that he had worked for a client in 
regard to a moderate rehabilitation project in Puerto Rico. He refused to 
answer other questions about his activities for the client. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard said that he had spoken to Dean when she was at HUD but did not know 
her personally.

FORMER TOP PIERCE AIDE MISSES HEARING; MAY RECEIVE SUBPOENA

Lance H. Wilson, a former top official at the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development who later made millions of dollars through his HUD connections, 
failed to appear Friday to testify before a House subcommittee investigating 
the scandal-stained agency. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the panel, said that he would ask 
the subcommittee members next week to subpoena Wilson to testify on Sept. 27 
about political favoritism and other abuses at HUD. He said that he also would 
seek all of Wilson's HUD-related documents. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, described as the right-hand assistant to former HUD Secretary Samuel R. 
Pierce Jr., managed for months to avoid questioning by HUD's inspector general 
about a housing rehabilitation program that generated six-figure fees for 
favored Republican consultants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delays Panel Appearance 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also has delayed a requested appearance before the House Government 
Operations subcommittee on employment and housing since he first was requested 
to testify more than two months ago, Lantos said. 
</P>
<P>
After agreeing to testify Friday, Wilson begged off on grounds that his 
attorney had been hospitalized. Yet he was quoted in the New York Times as 
saying: "I have nothing to hide." 
</P>
<P>
Lantos said that after he left the agency, Wilson was a member of a group of 
four former HUD officials who benefited from decisions approving seven projects 
under HUD's Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
Those projects involved rehabilitation of 1,347 rental units at a cost of more 
than $133 million in rent subsidies and $29 million in tax credits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that Mr. Wilson received more than $2 million" as a result of his 
involvement in the projects through the intervention of his hand-picked 
successor at HUD, Deborah Gore Dean, Lantos said at the outset of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the chairman said, Wilson received a 15% interest in 1985 in a 
$24-million Riviera Beach, Fla., project from developer Leonard Briscoe of Ft. 
Worth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backs Briscoe Grant 
</P>
<P>
Two years earlier, Lantos said, Wilson had backed a $7-million HUD grant, also 
advocated by Briscoe, that was awarded over the objections of a HUD regional 
administrator and career government employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Wilson is a prime example of how former HUD officials made millions of 
dollars as a result of HUD connections," Lantos said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Wilson is my prime candidate for a criminal investigation," said Rep. 
Christopher Shays (R-Conn.).

The House Rules Committee has rejected an amendment that would have prevented 
the government from closing some bases unless an audit found the savings to the 
Pentagon over six years exceeds the cost of closure or reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
The move means the amendment will likely be dropped next week when the House 
considers the military construction bill. But the committee delivered a victory 
Thursday to supporters of the Presidio, a San Francisco base that has been 
ordered to close. Lawmakers will be allowed to offer an amendment that would 
keep that base open. 
</P>
<P>
Other California bases that might have benefited from the rejected amendment 
are George AFB, Mather AFB, Norton AFB and Hunters Point Naval Station.

HEARING HELD FOR BOY FACING TRIAL AS ADULT

A 10-year-old Monroe County boy accused of homicide was angry the day he took 
his father's rifle and fatally shot a 7-year-old girl, according to testimony 
during a preliminary hearing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Carr, the father of the dead girl, testified he saw Cameron Kocher leave 
a neighbor's house in a fit of anger the day Jessica Ann Carr was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"He appeared to be very angry, very upset," Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor, Richard Ratti, in whose yard Jessica was shot, testified Cameron 
went home upset because Ratti would not allow the children to play video games. 
Ratti said he told the children they couldn't play because they had left a room 
messy. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors alleged that Cameron went home and loaded his father's .35-caliber 
rifle. They said Cameron pointed the gun out his parents' upstairs window and 
shot Jessica as she rode on the back of a snowmobile in the Rattis' yard below. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses testified Friday in Monroe County Court to determine whether 
there is enough evidence to send the case to trial. The hearing, which will 
resume Tuesday, is expected last several days. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Judge Ronald Vican ruled that Cameron, who was 9 years old at the 
time of the shooting, should face trial in criminal court, rather than juvenile 
court, because the adult court is better equipped to deal with the serious 
charge of criminal homicide. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of Friday's hearing, Cameron was also charged with two counts 
of aggravated assault in connection with Jessica's death, and with recklessly 
endangering the life of Shannon Ratti, 13, who was driving the snowmobile. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron sat between his parents in the front row of the jury assembly room 
being used as a courtroom. As in other hearings, Cameron showed no emotion 
throughout the hearing.

DIVISIVENESS SIMMERS IN ST. LOUIS; 
</P>
<P>
EFFORT TO OUST BLACK OFFICIAL STIRS CONCERNS ON RACE ISSUE 
</P>

<P>
Things have quieted down around here lately. The mayor is sleeping at home 
again. The yelling and name-calling have all but faded into memory. The 
barricades have even come down at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to say things are normal, though. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in the span of 12 hours, a prominent black city department director 
found herself barred from some areas of City Hall after the City Council 
stripped her of most of her powers and staff; her former husband, a city 
airport commissioner, was arrested after he allegedly threatened white Mayor 
Vincent C. Schoemehl's life, and Schoemehl, saying the man was linked to 
dangerous reputed drug dealers, took his family on the lam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Charges Surface 
</P>
<P>
It gets stranger still. Allegations of drug use permeate the tale, and the 
still-simmering controversy threatens to further polarize an already racially 
divided city. 
</P>
<P>
Still, longtime City Hall observers say it all is politics as usual in the 
Gateway City. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Louis politics is off the wall," said Kenneth Warren, political science 
professor at St. Louis University. "It's racist. It's conniving. It's 
undemocratic. It's still machine-like . . . . It's out of the Tammany Hall 
machine era." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the events of June 23, when things went wild at City Hall, Warren 
said: "It's not that atypical." 
</P>
<P>
Since local politics is, by all accounts, awash in wave upon wave of eccentric 
occurrences, finding the start of the most recent one is about as easy as 
tracking the course of a drop of water as it makes its way down the Mississippi 
River, on whose banks this most Southern of Midwestern cities sits. But last 
Oct. 17 is as good a place to start as any. 
</P>
<P>
That was the day Billie A. Boykins, the city license collector, was arrested 
for possession of cocaine and marijuana. The Illinois state trooper who stopped 
the car she was in and arrested her contends that Boykins admitted using 
cocaine "a lot" and told him, "I'm a politician. This is really going to hurt 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Boykins was subsequently indicted on drug charges. Her trial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Since she had only been charged and not convicted, no one sought to remove 
Boykins from office over the narcotics indictment. Even her frequent absences 
from work did not get her into trouble because it was known that she had cancer 
and she claimed that she kept in touch with the office by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
But then, in March, Boykins came under fierce attack. Missouri Auditor Margaret 
Kelly issued a devastating report on Boykins' department, alleging -- among 
other things -- that the city had lost up to $9 million through Boykins' inept 
collection of a city business tax and that she had illegally invested city 
funds. Kelly said the department was by far the worst she had ever audited. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis Circuit Atty. George Peach filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Boykins 
from office on the grounds of malfeasance and neglect of duty. At the same 
time, Thomas A. Villa, the president of the Board of Aldermen, introduced 
legislation to immediately strip Boykins of most of her authority and staff. 
</P>
<P>
Because Boykins' is a county office mandated by the state charter, the board 
did not have the authority to abolish it altogether. But it moved all but two 
of her 53 employees to another department and slashed her budget by $1 million 
to $138,631. The mayor supported both moves. 
</P>
<P>
"They basically attacked her from two fronts," said Kenneth Jones, an alderman 
who supports Boykins. "It was sort of like a double whammy." 
</P>
<P>
On the night the council took action, Schoemehl had Boykins' office locks 
changed, had barricades erected separating her personal office from the rest of 
the department and instructed guards to keep Boykins and her top assistant from 
entering the building. Some City Hall employees refer to it as the night of 
"the coup." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Sad Chapter' 
</P>
<P>
Villa called the events of that night "a sad chapter. I think the whole 
situation, from day one, was not something that any of us are particularly 
proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the city's black leaders have rallied behind Boykins, a former state 
legislator who is one of the city's few black officials elected citywide. Jones 
and others accuse her attackers of racism and of waging a political vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
"She is an African-American officeholder who basically is independent and would 
not allow the mayor to run her department," said Jones, noting that the 
department was rich in patronage jobs, many of which are filled by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Boykins ran the Rev. Jesse Jackson's local campaign for 
President last year in which Jackson defeated Rep. Richard A. Gephardt in the 
congressman's own hometown. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an embarrassment for the mayor as well as other local Democratic 
Party officials" who supported Gephardt, said Jones, who accused the party 
officials of trying to pay Boykins back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competency Issue Cited 
</P>
<P>
Those who voted to oust her from office said their action stemmed entirely from 
questions of her competence. 
</P>
<P>
"The audits don't lie," said Alderman James Shrewsberry. "The problem is that 
her offenses were so flagrant that something had to be done." 
</P>
<P>
As for Jones' charge that politics is involved, Shrewsberry said: "First off, I 
would not call Billie Boykins independent. Billie Boykins is part of the old 
organization . . . . She has been a longtime part of a patronage system that 
has served both black and white politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the city's political whirl quickly enveloped the Boykins case. 
</P>
<P>
After Boykins was arrested on drug charges in October, unsigned leaflets were 
distributed in some parts of the city alleging that the mayor, too, was 
involved with cocaine. The rumor became so rampant -- even now City Hall 
employees whisper about it -- that Schoemehl released the results of a urine 
test last February during the mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement he said that rumors of a drug habit started when he was 
hospitalized in 1987 for a pinched nerve and again in November, 1988, for a 
hernia operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never even seen cocaine," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs entered the picture again, at least obliquely, on June 23, when Schoemehl 
had Boykins' ex-husband arrested. Luther Boykins had gotten into a loud, 
profane argument with two of Schoemehl's assistants after the Board of Aldermen 
took its action against his ex-wife. Schoemehl contended that his life was 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
In taking his family into hiding, Schoemehl charged that Luther Boykins, an 
airport commissioner and a former ally of the mayor, was connected to a 
religious group, the Moorish Science Temple of America, that the police 
believed was linked to drug dealing and violence. 
</P>
<P>
Allies of Boykins noted that Schoemehl, too, had once been connected to the 
group, allowing its members to campaign for him in past elections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refuses to Press Charges 
</P>
<P>
Peach, the St. Louis circuit attorney, refused to press charges against Luther 
Boykins, saying that name-calling and loud talk do not constitute a crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the circus atmosphere prevailing at City Hall should be kept over 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying to the raucousness of St. Louis politics, Shrewsberry said: "I once 
spent four days in the hospital after I'd been beaten up because somebody 
didn't like who I was supporting for office. I take any kind of threat 
seriously. But I don't think Luther is a hit man . . . . I think it was just 
emotions were running very, very high that night." 
</P>
<P>
Things have quieted down somewhat, but the controversy is far from over. 
Boykins had filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the aldermen's actions. 
After a judge dismissed it Monday, her attorney said he would appeal all the 
way to the Supreme Court if necessary. Peach's lawsuit seeking to remove 
Boykins from office altogether still is pending, as is her trial for cocaine 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
Warren, the St. Louis University professor, said he finds it mystifying that 
black leaders are rallying to the support of an official who has been as 
discredited as Boykins has. The reason, he said, can only be that she holds an 
office that has traditionally, since the start of the civil rights era in the 
1960s, been held by a black. 
</P>
<P>
If she is removed, Gov. John Ashcroft, a Republican, would get to appoint her 
successor and he may choose to appoint a white to the post. 
</P>
<P>
Jones says that has nothing to do with his support of Boykins. 
</P>
<P>
He is supporting her, he said, because she is being persecuted unfairly. "The 
facts don't bear out the audit. There are logical, clear explanations for most 
of the charges lodged against her, but the press never printed her side of the 
story as it relates to the substantive matters raised." 
</P>
<P>
As for the cocaine indictment, he said: "I feel that a person is innocent until 
proven otherwise."

OPPOSE SOLICITING AT DISASTER SCENES; 
</P>
<P>
BAR UNITS SET ROADBLOCKS FOR 'AMBULANCE CHASERS' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ambulance-chasing lawyers are finding the roads to major disasters increasingly 
blocked these days by state bar associations. 
</P>
<P>
For example, within hours of last week's deadly crash of a United Airlines 
DC-10 at Sioux City, the Iowa State Bar Assn. put up what amounted to a 
lawyers-not-welcome sign at the scene of the tragedy where 111 died. Another 
185 passengers survived. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa's unfriendly welcome to lawyers reflected new and rapidly spreading legal 
profession efforts to shield disoriented survivors and distraught families of 
victims from aggressive lawyers or their representatives who race to the scenes 
of calamities in search of clients. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers are lured to disasters by prospects of profitable litigation and big 
settlements. Although the number who engage in this practice is relatively 
small, they have a negative impact on the image of attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has perceived this kind of conduct as the blackest of the black 
conduct that a lawyer can engage in," says Jim Sales, former president of the 
State Bar of Texas. A leader in the movement to keep client hustlers from 
disaster scenes, Sales says they behave "like rabid dogs in a feeding frenzy 
around the corpses at a mass disaster. It is unseemly conduct that must be 
stopped." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything you'd dislike more than trying to deal with personal 
tragedy and have some yo-yo trying to persuade you to sign a retainer 
agreement," says A. James Elliott, former Georgia State Bar Assn. president. 
</P>
<P>
State bar associations in Iowa and at least five other states, including 
California and Texas, now have disaster response plans designed to curtail 
solicitation of business by lawyers and agents for lawyers. Most have put those 
plans in place within the last year. Bar associations in at least four other 
states are in the final stages of drafting disaster responses. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (these plans) really respond to the need to protect the public," says 
James Bascue, the State Bar of California's chief trial counsel. The 
association is prepared, Bascue says, to send investigators to the site of any 
disaster where California lawyers are engaged in questionable conduct. "We 
would have sent them to Alaska (after the Exxon Valdez spill) if there had been 
a complaint." 
</P>
<P>
That is the kind of attitude Elliot would like to see in all states. "One of 
the things we're trying to do is get bar counsels -- the lawyers who do 
discipline for bar associations -- to cooperate," he says. "That way we can say 
to a lawyer that not only do we consider we have jurisdiction but we have 
already notified the disciplinary authorities of your bar association. I think 
most people at that stage will decide it is probably just as well to pack up 
and get the hell back out." 
</P>
<P>
"Within the next 12 months every major bar in the country will have a 
contingency plan ready," said Phoenix lawyer Mark I. Harrison, chairman of an 
American Bar Assn. special committee on professionalism that is drafting a set 
of guidelines for state bar associations. 
</P>
<P>
The Assn. of Trial Lawyers of America, whose members represent disaster victims 
and their families, also opposes solicitation by lawyers at the scenes of 
tragedies, including contact by representatives of the airlines' legal teams 
and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Activities of lawyers and representatives of lawyers at recent disasters 
prompted action by the legal profession. 
</P>
<P>
Last July when a department store collapsed in Brownsville, Tex., families of 
the 14 dead and 47 injured were solicited by lawyers and agents for lawyers 
posing as Red Cross workers and clergymen. 
</P>
<P>
"They were signing them up before they had even been seen by a doctor while 
they were under this tremendous emotional stress, pain and even under 
medication," Sales said. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, after the August, 1987, crash of a Northwest Airlines plane that 
killed 156 people, a man posing as a Roman Catholic priest consoled relatives 
and steered their legal business to a Florida lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
And the Assn. of Trial Lawyers drafted its "Victims Bill of Rights" attacking 
solicitation at disasters after American client-seeking lawyers descended on 
Bhopal, India, in 1984 when a toxic gas release from a Union Carbide factory 
killed more than 3,300 people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Iowa Response 
</P>
<P>
Iowa's response to last week's crash of United Flight 232 typifies the 
reception various bar associations have planned for lawyers who rush to 
disaster scenes. Within hours of the late afternoon crash, the Iowa State Bar 
Assn. had: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arranged for an office inside the Marian Medical Center where most of the 
injured were taken and dispatched two top officials to the scene, including 
Carl Nielson, who serves as the association's executive director and secretary 
of the Iowa Supreme Court commission that disciplines lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Notified media throughout Iowa that an office was being set up to monitor 
the conduct of lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Briefed hospital personnel on what was ethical and unethical conduct by 
lawyers and explained that they were not obligated to give attorneys access to 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arranged for an eye-grabbing advertisement in the Sioux City Journal 
designed to inform victims and their families that lawyers could not solicit 
business, make recommendations to anyone who did not ask for them or use agents 
to solicit clients. The ad contained a phone number for complaints and put 
lawyers on notice that their conduct was being monitored. 
</P>
<P>
Bar associations have an obligation to police improper conduct, says 
Northwestern University professor Mark F. Grady, an expert in economics and the 
law. "But if it's simply a matter of a lawyer representing himself to be a 
lawyer and saying: 'Listen, I'd like to represent you and this is what the fee 
would be,' that's completely benign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Competitive Process' 
</P>
<P>
"This is basically a regulation of the competitive process," Grady added. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles lawyer Alan Gutman, who went to Sioux City after the crash, is also 
critical of the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"In a criminal procedure setting, a person accused of a crime has a 
constitutional right to speak to an attorney prior to being questioned," says 
Gutman, a 28-year-old Hollywood attorney. "There is a parallel in play here 
because these people have substantial interests and rights that are being 
affected and there ought to be some sort of prohibition in effect that would 
prevent the insurance investigators of the airlines from questioning any of 
these individuals about anything prior to the time they talk to a 
representative on their side." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the programs are designed to suggest to survivors and families of 
victims that they ought to go slow in dealing with anybody," says Harrison, 
"not just plaintiff lawyers. That has been a real concern in dealing with the 
problem, being even handed." 
</P>
<P>
Gutman says he made no attempt to solicit clients while in Sioux City but adds: 
"We are interested in representing people who have claims arising from the 
disaster, yet I was not interested in circumventing the laws of Iowa." 
</P>
<P>
Iowa's state bar began preparing a disaster response plan after a February 
American Bar Assn. meeting in Denver where lawyers discussed plans for 
responding to catastrophic disasters. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have some thought on it before (a disaster) ever happened," says 
Nielsen. "We had the ad ready with only a blank to fill in as to what kind of a 
disaster it was. We didn't know if we'd ever have a disaster but if we did, we 
wanted to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
So far the Iowa bar has notified Florida bar officials about questionable 
conduct by a Miami attorney and is investigating a second lawyer who is 
allegedly soliciting still-hospitalized crash survivors. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first attempts to police unethical activity by lawyers at disasters 
was in California when the State Bar sent two investigators to Cerritos after 
the 1986 collision of an Aeromexico DC-9 and a private aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a little more sophisticated plan now than we did then," says Clayton 
R. Anderson, director of investigations for the State Bar of California. "What 
we have now is a plan wherein we will have packages of information that we will 
take to the area. We will advise the people what lawyers can and can't do so 
they aren't intimidated, so they feel free to escort a lawyer out of the 
immediate area where survivors may be. We would probably set up an office and 
we are just drafting (an ad) now. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to condense the rules that pertain to solicitation down to a 
manageable form for an ad," says Anderson. "The board of governors for the 
State Bar approved all of this and they didn't get any negative comments."

STATE FILES $150-MILLION SUIT OVER DEFUNCT INSURANCE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie filed a $150-million lawsuit 
Friday against five former directors of the defunct TMIC Insurance Co., 
alleging their negligence contributed to the company's demise. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the Superior Court suit were Raymond Rodeno, TMIC's chairman and chief 
executive officer; Gary Bradford, president and chief operating officer; John 
Hoof Jr., director of sales and marketing; Robert Cohen, treasurer and chief 
financial officer, and Thomas Kennedy, senior vice president for risk 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie was appointed liquidator of TMIC in April, 1988. At the time, the 
state estimated that TMIC's assets totaled $169 million less than its 
liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The defunct company's major creditors include scores of thrifts, as well as the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., and the Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
TMIC's troubles stemmed from policies it issued on mortgages held by investors 
in a Virginia-based real estate tax shelter known as Equity Programs Investment 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1985, EPIC defaulted on $1.4 billion in mortgage loans for 20,000 
homes, mostly in the Southwest. Between 1976 and 1985, TMIC had issued 
insurance on more than 9,000 EPIC loans and was the largest single insurer of 
mortgage guaranty insurance covering mortgage loans made to EPIC, the suit 
says.

<P>
A sailboat ran aground and sank Friday off Anacapa Island, but the crew managed 
to call for help before sinking and all five people aboard were rescued, the 
Coast Guard reported. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty dramatic," Petty Officer Dennis Hull said. "They put out a 
Mayday, gave their position, and told us what was happening. Then the radio 
went dead." 
</P>
<P>
A National Park Service boat arrived quickly on the scene, just west of Anacapa 
Island, part of the Channel Islands National Park, and plucked three people out 
of the ocean, Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in the (60-degree) water 10 or 15 minutes," Hull said. "Any longer, 
and we would have had a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
The other two people swam to rocks on Anacapa Island, where they were rescued 
by a Coast Guard patrol boat.

ILLEGAL ALIENS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY COMMIT 12% OF FELONIES, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new study has found that illegal aliens represented 12% of the people 
arrested for felony offenses in San Diego County during a recent one-year 
period but that they are less likely to be accused of violent crimes or 
narcotics violations than U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Undocumented residents are thought to represent about 5% or less of the 
county's permanent population of about 2.4 million, according to U.S. 
immigration authorities. However, the county, which shares a long border with 
Mexico, is crossed by hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants headed 
for the U.S. interior every year. 
</P>
<P>
The study's sponsors, the San Diego Assn. of Governments, a regional research 
and planning group composed of representatives from each of the county's 
municipalities, called the analysis the most comprehensive ever done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Debate 
</P>
<P>
The findings -- indicating that aliens make up a proportionally higher number 
of criminal suspects than U.S. citizens -- immediately ignited renewed 
controversy about an emotion-filled issue that has been a source of debate in 
border communities for a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
"I question the methodology and the motivation of this study," said Jess D. 
Haro, chairman of the board of the Chicano Federation of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Latino groups here have long challenged the wisdom of separating out crime 
numbers involving illegal aliens, as they maintain that such comparisons 
perpetuate a negative stereotype of immigrants -- mostly from Mexico -- and 
serve little useful purposes. Moreover, critics have attacked the use of arrest 
numbers as misleading, contending that mostly white law enforcement officers 
have historically been more inclined to arrest minorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Racial Imbalance 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of study is never credible as long as 95% of the judges, prosecutors 
and cops are white and are filling the jails mostly with people who are black 
and Hispanic," Haro said. "It perpetuates the perception that we are all 
criminals." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Pennell, a co-author of the report, said the study, which took 2 1/2 
years to complete, was needed so local authorities could learn how immigration 
affected their criminal justice budgets. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-area officials plan to use the data to seek additional federal funds 
to offset the immigration-related criminal justice costs, Pennell said. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which had a margin of error of 1%, Pennell said, examined the 
one-year period between July 1, 1985, and June 30, 1986. A total of 4,431 
felony arrest reports, chosen at random from throughout the area, were reviewed 
and used as the data base. 
</P>
<P>
The study showed that U.S. citizens were more likely to be arrested for crimes 
of violence and suspected narcotics violations, while aliens were more 
frequently accused of crimes of property. 
</P>
<P>
"This repudiates the perception touted through the media that undocumented 
immigrants are responsible for more violent crimes," said Pennell, the study's 
co-author. "Their crimes tend to be income-generating, which is logical for a 
poor, disenfranchised community." 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics violations accounted for 15% of the arrests of illegal aliens, 
compared to 21% for U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Of illegal aliens arrested, the report stated, the highest proportion 
apprehended was in the larceny category, which accounted for almost a quarter 
of all arrested. Motor vehicle theft and burglary each accounted for about one 
in five of those arrested, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Among U.S. citizens arrested, the study showed, 14% were suspected of larceny, 
12% of motor vehicle theft and 17% of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
As for violent crimes, the study showed that 8% of illegal aliens were arrested 
for aggravated assaults, 7% for robbery, 6% for rape and 1% for homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Among U.S. citizen arrests, by contrast, 18% were apprehended for aggravated 
assaults, 8% for robbery, 7% for rape and 2% for homicide.

HIRING BIAS AGAINST LEGAL ALIENS CALLED WIDESPREAD

More than half a million employers follow a "pattern of discrimination" in 
their refusal to hire legal aliens and first-generation Americans for fear of 
contravening recent changes in immigration laws, the U.S. Civil Rights 
Commission charged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The commission reviewed a report by the General Accounting Office on the 
Immigration Control and Reform Act of 1986, which prohibits employers from 
hiring illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires employees to provide proof of citizenship or legal status in 
the United States. But based on an employer survey conducted by the GAO, 
employers are discriminating against potential employees who only look or sound 
foreign, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 16% of the employers said they had begun using new 
methods of screening applicants for jobs since the immigration law was 
implemented. Ten percent said they hired only U.S. citizens, and 7% said they 
asked for documents establishing legal status only from applicants who looked 
or sounded foreign. More than 80% of those reporting that they had taken these 
precautions said they feared the possibility of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the survey points to a pattern, if not a widespread pattern, of 
discrimination," said commission spokesman John Eastman, adding that Hispanics 
and Asians are the two groups most frequently discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
Eastman said the commission will ask the GAO to provide more data on 
discriminatory practices. If this data reveals widespread patterns of 
discrimination, it could lead to a change in the immigration law, including a 
provision that would remove employer sanctions, Eastman said.

A federal judge declined a request Friday to immediately order Commerce 
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher to enforce regulations designed to save 
endangered turtles from drowning in shrimp nets. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan said National Wildlife Federation 
lawyers had made a strong case for such an order and he scheduled another 
hearing for Thursday to consider more arguments from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he would rule on conservationists' request for an injunction 
against Mosbacher soon after the hearing. Mosbacher, faced with hundreds of 
angry shrimpers threatening to renew weekend blockades of Gulf Coast ports, 
issued a 45-day moratorium Monday on enforcement of federal regulations that 
require shrimp trawlers to use turtle excluder devices in their nets. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, animal rights groups called Friday for a national boycott of shrimp 
until the government enforces the excluder rules.

<P>
Embattled Mayor James Usry admitted through a lawyer Friday that he took money 
from a businessman working undercover for the state police, but said there was 
no bribe and that the cash was intended for a charity fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
Usry, 67, was arrested Thursday and charged along with more than a dozen other 
Atlantic City officials and businessmen in a series of alleged 
influence-peddling schemes. He said he was innocent of charges that he accepted 
a $6,000 bribe and that he would not step down as mayor. 
</P>

SEXUAL DISORDER CAUSED AF PILOT'S BIGAMY, COURT TOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
An Air Force pilot fighting bigamy charges in a court-martial suffered from a 
sexual disorder that clouded his mind and led him to marry a British woman 
suspected of spying, his lawyer argued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Neil Clark, 41, is accused of bigamy, immigration fraud and conduct 
unbecoming of an officer for a brief entanglement with a woman who paid him 
$2,000 to get married in a Reno wedding chapel so that she could remain in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Five Air Force officers -- four men and a woman -- make up the court-martial 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, a 19-year Air Force veteran eligible to retire next year, stands to lose 
his military pension and serve up to seven years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signed Papers 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Robert Rivkin, said in an interview before the court-martial that 
Clark, who is married and has two children, acted irrationally in marrying 
Margaret Vickerage. He said Clark never intended to defraud immigration 
officials by signing papers to allow Vickerage, as his wife, to remain in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Rivkin said Clark and Vickerage had a brief affair, and they ended up getting 
married in a Reno wedding chapel last Nov. 25. The next morning, when Clark 
awoke in a motel room after having sex with the woman, he voided the $2,000 
check and left Vickerage in Reno, Rivkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark married Vickerage because he suffered from a "sexual disorder" that made 
him promiscuous, Rivkin said. His desire for Vickerage was so strong that he 
suffered from a state of diminished mental capacity, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Rivkin contends that Vickerage had been under surveillance as a suspected spy 
by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. He said Vickerage has lived 
near several U.S. bases in England and the United States and gained extensive 
knowledge of flight operations through romantic relationships with several Air 
Force officers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Charged 
</P>
<P>
Vickerage, 46, has not been charged with espionage and is not expected to be 
called as a witness. She is now living in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials have refused to discuss Rivkin's allegations about 
espionage. Presiding Judge Col. Kenneth Randall refused to let Rivkin introduce 
testimony about spying in Clark's trial, ruling that there was no basis for the 
court to consider Air Force suspicions of Vickerage. 
</P>
<P>
Clark piloted KC-135Q aircraft, which refueled the SR-71 spy plane. Rivkin said 
Clark never provided classified information to Vickerage and fully cooperated 
with Air Force investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Rivkin said the case against Clark was "discriminatory and hypocritical" 
because adultery is widespread in the Air Force.

RAY BUCKEY CALLS PORN IRRELEVANT; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDANT ALSO TELLS OF IGNORING ADVICE TO DESTROY MATERIAL 
</P>

<P>
Ray Buckey told a prosecutor in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial 
Friday that he ignored an investigator's warning to get rid of pornographic 
pictures because "I still used them." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, who testified earlier that he used adult pornography for sexual 
gratification, said that a now-deceased private detective, Paul Bynum, advised 
him in the summer of 1984 to destroy the pornographic pictures he kept in his 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
"He said it would be best not to have them," Buckey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did you not take his advice and get rid of them?" asked Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Lael Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Still Used Them' 
</P>
<P>
"I still used them," Buckey replied. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with 64 
counts of molestation and one joint count of conspiracy stemming from the 
operation of their family owned preschool in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Their trial, now in its 27th month, is the longest and most costly in Los 
Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said he did not decide to get rid of the pornography until police 
"started banging on the door" of his parents' home just before his arrest on 
child molestation charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I panicked and I went to get them and tried to flush them down the toilet and 
threw them out the window," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Rubin placed the pictures before him on the witness stand and hammered away 
at the subject of Buckey's use of pornography, the defendant protested that the 
adult pictures were irrelevant to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it's any relevant evidence at all," he said. "What's that got 
to do with allegations of molesting children?"

FIELD OF DREAMS AT HERITAGE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY JO HILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sound of water splashing into a pond, the soft cooing of ring-necked doves 
and the cheerful chattering of finches float on the wind. 
</P>
<P>
A cool morning breeze rustles the sheltering branches of an old California 
pepper tree and whirls a windmill atop a turn-of-the-century-style white and 
green tank house. Suddenly the air seems somehow fresher, more restful. 
</P>
<P>
Ah. How nice to be in the country, away from the bustle of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
This particular Elysian field is Heritage Park, and it is tucked into a Santa 
Fe Springs industrial park east of Interstate 605. 
</P>
<P>
Heritage Park is a green oasis of Victorian Gothic ambience smack in the midst 
of a highly industrialized city with a resident population of 15,000 and a 
work-force population of 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
The six-acre park, which opened in 1987, is a re-creation of a thriving citrus 
ranch/estate that horticulturist Harvay Hawkins began there in the 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attention to Detail 
</P>
<P>
The careful attention to historic detail makes Heritage much more than a 
peaceful, beautiful park. It also is a historical site, a hands-on educational 
tool, a much-sought-after meeting place for local groups and even a setting for 
romantic weddings. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious undertaking at the park was totally rebuilding structures 
that were destroyed as the once-grand ranch fell into ruins after oil was 
discovered there in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
The elaborate carriage barn, which cost $5,000 to build in the 1880s, burned in 
1969. In its place sits an elegant replica that is a history center full of 
artifacts and exhibits on turn-of-the-century life in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the barn is an Emerson surrey, carefully restored after it 
was "found in 100 pieces in a yard in Norwalk," says Margaret Hammon, historian 
at the park. 
</P>
<P>
The carriage is part of a display on transportation. Other displays include an 
area where children can dress up in 1900s clothes or look through a 
stereoscope. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors also can imagine what it was like to be one of the barefoot children 
in overalls in the near-life-size circa-1919 photo from Santa Fe Springs' 
one-room schoolhouse or learn about early citrus farming -- "When Air Was Pure 
and When Money Grew on Trees." 
</P>
<P>
A conservatory also has been re-created. "One of the important things about 
having wealth a hundred years ago was to have a beautiful garden," Hammon says, 
"and this building is called a conservatory, a fancy name for a greenhouse. 
It's based on English design. . . . We rebuilt it the way it looked a hundred 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
While Hawkins probably used the building to nurture seedlings or exotic 
botanical specimens, the conservatory now is stocked with greenery and 
flowering plants of the season. This summer, spider plants and asparagus ferns 
hang from the roof, while pots of colorful begonias and other flowers crowd the 
shelves and floor. 
</P>
<P>
It's cool in the conservatory even on a warm day. Water spills from a 
three-tiered fountain, and a cool breeze circulates as air is drawn through the 
windows and out vents in the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby stands a new windmill/tank house. This building serves as a lesson on 
how fields were irrigated at the turn of the century and what life was like 
before modern plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can try their hands at a working pump that draws water from an 
artesian well into a concrete reservoir. In the old days, the windmill ran the 
pump and water would go from the reservoir into a "standpipe" that released it 
into ditches for irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
And visitors can climb steel steps to the top of the tank house to see the 
whole park and marvel at its surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Added attractions are: basement and fireplace ruins of the ranch house; 
English-style gardens with planters and fountains; beautiful trees old enough 
to have been planted by Hawkins himself; an aviary with doves, finches, button 
quail, cockatiels, pheasants and other types of birds; The Kitchen, serving 
sandwiches and salads from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday-Friday, and two 
archeological sites: the foundation of an 1818 adobe and its family's trash 
pit, now playfully dubbed "Rancho Rubbish." 
</P>
<P>
The land originally was zoned for industrial development when the city 
purchased it in 1984. However, as the property's history became known, the idea 
of a park took shape, Hammon says. 
</P>
<P>
First, the archeologists found the long-rumored Patricio Ontiveros adobe site 
and other artifacts. Then photos taken of the estate in the 1890s surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
"Over a period of time, the idea blossomed," Hammon says. "Originally they were 
just going to build the carriage barn, and then they decided to do the 
conservatory and the tank house; eventually the whole site was developed." 
</P>
<P>
She says the old photos were used as blueprints to take "a field of weeds" and 
turn it into Heritage Park. 
</P>
<P>
City officials quickly realized the educational potential of the park and 
placed it under the supervision of the Santa Fe Springs City Library staff, 
assisted by park rangers who provide round-the-clock security and a dedicated 
core group of docents who help conduct tours and answer park visitors' 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"History is my favorite subject and I love this," says Anita Kiesel, a 
67-year-old docent and Santa Fe Springs resident. Conducting tours for children 
is her favorite docent activity. "It's a real joy," she says. She especially 
recalls one child who told her recently, "I didn't think this would be fun and 
I enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
Docent Larry Oblea, 37, has lived in Santa Fe Springs most of his life. He 
likes conducting tours of the tank house and the adobe foundation and says "old 
Spanish-Era history" is his specialty. 
</P>
<P>
Oblea enjoys telling visitors about when Patricio Ontiveros lived on the site 
as overseer of a cattle herd belonging to Mission San Juan Capistrano. He 
explains how the land belonged to the Nieto family and that the quarreling and 
intrigue over cattle at that time "could make a good soap opera." 
</P>
<P>
Armida Boales, 42, says it was love at first sight when she saw the park. She 
lives in Los Angeles, but works in Santa Fe Springs and enjoys being a docent. 
"I love museums, and to me Heritage Park is a museum, even though most of it is 
outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
Boales says most visitors to the park are "really so proud of Santa Fe Springs 
for doing this, so it makes me feel good that I'm part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming special activities at the park include Children's Day and Friday 
afternoon concerts in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Day, Aug. 13 from noon to 4 p.m., will feature a pie-eating contest, 
scavenger hunt, a chance to wash clothes on an old-fashioned scrub board, 
storytelling, turn-of-the-century games and a puppet show. 
</P>
<P>
The concerts are each Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and feature a variety 
of music, including Smokewood (bluegrass) on Aug. 4 and Nova String Quartet 
Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Heritage Park, 12100 Mora Drive, Santa Fe Springs; open 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. every 
day. The carriage barn is open Wednesdays and Thursdays 9 a.m.-4 p.m.; 
Tuesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays noon-4 p.m.; the tank house is open 
most Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Ranger may be available for tours at other 
times. There is no admission charge. Group tours available by appointment: call 
(213) 946-6476.

CALIFORNIA OUTRIGGERS; 
</P>
<P>
PADDLE MAKES PERFECT IN THE ANCIENT SPORT OF CANOE SURF RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARILYN OLIVER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While you're relaxing on the beach this summer, you may be surprised to see 
outrigger canoes crashing through the surf. No, you're not in Hawaii or Tahiti. 
You're just witnessing a popular Southland pastime, the ancient Polynesian 
sport of outrigger-canoe racing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely a growing sport, especially in Southern California," says 
Mike D'Alessio, president of KOA, the California Outrigger Assn. (Koa is also 
the name of the wood Hawaiians used to carve traditional outrigger canoes, so 
the association took some liberty in the acronym.) 
</P>
<P>
Spectators can enjoy outrigger-canoe races sponsored by clubs from Santa 
Barbara to San Diego throughout the summer. If you're willing to devote several 
evenings a week to practice, it's not too late to join in the fun. All the 
clubs welcome new members, men and women. Several clubs even have programs for 
kids who are 8 or older. 
</P>
<P>
D'Alessio says: "Some people are attracted to this sport because of its 
cultural implications. It captures the romance of Hawaii while offering a 
recreational outlet. Others view it as a purely competitive sport. These people 
train 10 months of the year. One paddler said, 'It feels as if you're running 
the 100-yard dash for two hours straight.' There's room in outrigging for both 
extremes and for everyone in between." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ultimate Team Sport 
</P>
<P>
"This is the ultimate team sport," says Derek Harrison, a high school dean of 
students who coaches Imua Outrigger Canoe Club in Newport Beach. "We attract 
world-class athletes as well as amateurs. The trust out on the water is 
unbelievable. Trust is the component that makes the difference between a good 
and a truly great team." 
</P>
<P>
The sport takes tremendous concentration, says Craig Bluell of Offshore 
Outrigger Canoe Club, also from Newport Beach. "The team of four to six 
paddlers has to keep in time, and everyone has to pull as one." While 
Polynesians, the Vikings of the Pacific, paddled outrigger canoes carved from 
koa wood, most canoes today are made from fiberglass and resin, but their 
design remains the same. Paddlers board the canoes from the left, where the 
ama, or long float that balances the craft, is connected to the hull. 
</P>
<P>
Team members help push the canoes and paddlers into the surf, waiting until a 
wave hits to carry the crafts into the sea. The canoes are paddled to the 
starting line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really exhilarating when you're at the starting line and the official 
drops the green flag," says Jeanne de Lorenzo of Redondo Beach, who paddles on 
the novice team for Lanakila Outrigger Canoe Club. "It helps to be first off 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
At the drop of the flag, the canoes are off in a fury of paddling. In regattas, 
teams sprint around buoy-marked courses that are one-half, 2 1/2 and 3 miles 
long. The daylong regattas offer camaraderie with other clubs and basking in 
the sun between events. They end with a party at a nearby bistro or eatery. 
Trophies are awarded to all members of winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Events of the Season 
</P>
<P>
The outrigger season is made up of three parts, each featuring a different 
event. The season begins in May with "Ironman" races, teams of six paddlers 
racing 9 to 13 miles parallel to the shore. The regatta season in June and July 
features sprints. 
</P>
<P>
In August and early September, paddlers test their endurance in long-distance 
races of 20 to 40 miles or more, which can last five or six hours start to 
finish. A starting team of six paddles for the first half hour. Then three 
relief paddlers jump into the water from a nearby escort boat. As they pull 
themselves into the canoe, three tired paddlers roll out. Accomplished teams 
make the switch without missing a stroke. Switches are made every 10 to 20 
minutes during the race, which can last 5 hours or longer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a special accomplishment to paddle to Catalina," says Darlene Bible, who 
paddles for Kai Nalu Outrigger Canoe Club in Marina del Rey. The Catalina race 
is held annually in late August. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had paddlers come out three weeks before the race and participate in the 
event," says Bud Hohl of Offshore Club, sponsor of the event. 
</P>
<P>
This year, teams from California, Arkansas, Hawaii and British Columbia will 
compete. Women's teams race from Newport to Avalon on Aug. 26; men's teams will 
race back on Aug. 27. A luau, which is open to the public, will follow at 
Newport Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Team Based on Skill 
</P>
<P>
Teams are based on skill level and age. Adults who are paddling for their first 
year are in the novice category. More advanced paddlers are divided into 
freshmen, sophomore, junior and senior categories. Masters' teams are made up 
of women over 35 and men over 40. 
</P>
<P>
Each position on the six-person team plays a significant role. The stroker sits 
in the first position and sets the pace. The second seat assists the stroker. 
The third, fourth and fifth paddlers provide power. The sixth paddler steers. 
</P>
<P>
Paddling is rhythmically divided into 15 strokes. On the 14th stroke, the 
person in the second seat calls "Hut," warning that the paddlers should switch 
to the other side on the 15th stroke, when all respond "Ho." Some teams call 
"Hut, hut, ho," on the 13th, 14th and 15th strokes. 
</P>
<P>
"Most paddlers can paddle 62 to 68 strokes per minute," says Ron Harrig, 
president of Santa Barbara Outrigger Canoe Club. "The sprint stroke is shorter 
and even quicker, with 72 to 74 paddles per minute. In Tahiti, they paddle even 
faster." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benefits of Paddling 
</P>
<P>
Participants are enthusiastic about the physical benefits of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Paddling is a great workout," says Donna Fea, who paddles as a novice for 
Lanakila Club in Redondo Beach. "You can really feel it after two or three days 
of working out. Most paddlers work with weights off-season and run during the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great aerobic and anaerobic sport," says Victor DiNove of 'Uhane 
Outrigger Canoe Club in Santa Barbara. "It elevates the heartbeat and helps the 
cardiovascular system while developing upper-body strength." 
</P>
<P>
Said Karen Ingalls at a recent regatta in Santa Monica Bay: "My husband dropped 
20 pounds in about three months of paddling. It's a very time-consuming sport, 
but I will say it's great for the figure. You gain in the upper chest and lose 
around the waist. I'm joining up with the women's team." Ingalls' husband 
paddles for Newport Outrigger Canoe Club. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great physical activity, agrees Darlene Bible. "I paddled for the 
first eight months of my pregnancy last year, and three weeks after the baby 
was born, I was able to paddle in the state championships in Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exotic Competitions 
</P>
<P>
Outrigger-canoe racing has been on the Southern California scene for 30 years. 
According to Bud Hohl of Offshore Club, the sport was brought to the Mainland 
in 1959 by A. E. "Toots" Minville, considered the father of the sport. Minville 
also originated the annual 42-mile Molokai Race. Women from the Offshore team 
have won that race three times in recent years. Local paddlers participate in 
international competitions in exotic places such as Hawaii and Tahiti. In 1990, 
they will travel to New Zealand for the world sprint championship. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the benefit of body conditioning, paddlers enjoy the camaraderie of a 
sport that cuts across class and professional lines. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got bankers, city officials, real-estate brokers, construction workers, 
aerospace salesmen and landscape architects in our club. When you're out on the 
ocean, you leave that type of competition behind," says Charles Spence, a 
banker from Newport Beach. At 60, Spence is the oldest member of the Offshore 
Outrigger Canoe Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Being on the ocean humbles you," says Dee Van Winkle of San Diego Outrigger 
Canoe Club. "You hardly ever see a paddler who smokes or does drugs, and 
drinking is limited to the party after an event." 
</P>
<P>
"Paddling is a relief from my fast-paced life," says Donna Fea, who teaches 
math at Redondo High School and who has just received her MBA from UCLA. "The 
ocean breeze and the smell of the sea are invigorating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Members 
</P>
<P>
Most outrigger canoe clubs in KOA seek new members who are willing to put in 
practice time to develop proficiency in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
While you don't have to be an expert swimmer to participate, you should be 
water-safe, as canoes sometimes can tip you into the briny. 
</P>
<P>
Most clubs charge a fee for the racing season ranging from $150 to $200 per 
person. 
</P>
<P>
Clubs are listed here by their beaches. For more information, contact the club 
nearest you or KOA president Mike D'Alessio, (213) 542-8757.

600 FELINES WILL COMPETE AT INTERNATIONAL CAT SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
INCATS it's called, standing for International Cat Shows, and it returns this 
weekend to the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
It's billed as "the largest and most prestigious cat competition in the 
country," and maybe it is. Whatever, about 600 felines -- household pets and 40 
breeds of purebred prize winners -- are competing in a 16-ring program, and if 
last year's turnout is an indication, more than 25,000 ailurophiles are 
expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the main competitions for "top cat" (finals Sunday afternoon) and 
the usual grooming demonstrations, cat-product exhibits and breed-information 
center, a "Supercat" competition will be held today, noon to 2 p.m., sponsored 
by Hills Pet Products for the benefit of Actors and Others for Animals. The 
competition is open only to formerly homeless cats, adopted and/or rescued, and 
includes whimsical categories of competition (i.e. cat/owner look-alikes), 
celebrity judges, prizes and ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, also from noon until 2 p.m., Whiskas puts on a "Household Cat of the 
Year" contest with winners receiving an all-expenses-paid trip to New York for 
a final competition in Madison Square Garden. (Winner of that show gets to fly 
to London for the "Supreme Cat Show.") 
</P>
<P>
The center is at 800 W. Katella Ave. in Anaheim. Hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m. today 
and Sunday. Admission is $6 for adults, $4 for seniors 65 and older and 
children under 12. Call (818) 896-3875 for further information.

HERALD EXAMINER GOES ON THE BLOCK -- OFFICIALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Herald Examiner was officially put up for sale on Friday. The 
newspaper's parent, Hearst Corp., said it has hired New York investment banker 
Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to approach potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Hearst has been privately pursuing a sale for months. Millionaire Marvin Davis 
and the Toronto Sun Publishing Co. of Canada have already considered and 
rejected a purchase of the paper. Herald Examiner management also is 
considering an employee buyout plan. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Danzig, vice president and general manager of Hearst Newspapers, said 
the Herald Examiner does not fit with the company's "strategic direction." 
</P>
<P>
The Herald Examiner, founded 86 years ago by William Randolph Hearst, has been 
losing money for at least a decade. There has been speculation in the newspaper 
industry that the Herald Examiner might be closed if a buyer isn't found.

BANGERTER BROTHERS RESIGN TOP POSTS AT CARE ENTERPRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top two executives of Care Enterprises have resigned as part of a 
reorganization plan intended to bring the nursing home chain out of bankruptcy 
proceedings, attorneys said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Twin brothers Dee Roy and Lee Roy Bangerter on Thursday began paid leaves of 
absence that will last 60 days or until the court confirms the proposed 
reorganization plan, said David Kupetz, an attorney representing the company. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the plan calls for the brothers to be retained as consultants, and 
each would receive a salary of $250,000 a year, which is higher than their 
current $211,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Roy Bangerter was chief executive of the chain, while Dee Roy was chief 
financial officer. Their mother, Opal Winn Bangerter, founded the chain in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization plan, presented Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los 
Angeles, also would allow the company to retire its $80-million debt to 
unsecured creditors by giving the creditors an 85% equity interest in the 
company in the form of stock. 
</P>
<P>
Ownership of the firm by Care's existing shareholders, including the 
Bangerters, would be reduced to 15%. Peter Landsberg, attorney for the 
unsecured creditors, said the plan also calls for retiring Care's $40-million 
bank debt in about three years. He said the first $10 million would be paid 
"fairly promptly" and may be raised from the sale of nursing homes. Other 
payments, he said, will be made out of operating profits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Millions Saved' 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both the company and creditors said a settlement was reached in 
part to avoid a lengthy debate over various competing reorganization proposals. 
In addition, litigation was scheduled to begin Aug. 8 over a demand from the 
creditors to have the management of Care Enterprises turned over to a court 
trustee. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure there will be millions of dollars saved in administrative costs by 
avoiding extensive litigation over a plan and the appointment of a trustee," 
Kupetz said. 
</P>
<P>
Care Enterprises, one of the nation's largest nursing home operators, filed for 
protection from creditors in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Baldwin Jr., previously chief operating officer, will serve as chief 
executive until a replacement is found, Kupetz said.

American Express Apologizes to Safra: American Express Co. said it apologized 
to international banker Edmond Safra for what it called "an unauthorized and 
shameful effort" to encourage false media reports that Safra's banks had been 
involved in money laundering. American Express also agreed to pay $4 million to 
charity as part of its unusual apology. In letters released by the two sides, 
American Express Chairman James D. Robinson III said people "acting on behalf 
of American Express began an unauthorized and shameful effort to use the media 
to malign" Safra and Republic National Bank of New York, in which Safra holds a 
33% stake.

QINTEX BUYS 2 ORANGE COUNTY RESORT PROPERTIES FOR $245 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER and LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australian entrepreneur Christopher Skase's Qintex Group, which just four 
months ago agreed to acquire the United Artists movie studio, has purchased two 
major coastal properties in Orange County for a price believed to be about $245 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex, whose Mirage resorts division owns two vacation complexes in Australia 
and one in Hawaii, plans to build a "five-star integrated Mirage resort" on the 
two sites, including a hotel, spa, retail center and residential villas. 
</P>
<P>
Skase said in a telephone interview Friday that the exact plans for the two 
parcels had not been finalized and that construction would not begin for about 
two years. He said having the two properties, which together total about 350 
acres, would give the project "critical mass" and made the purchases a 
"superior economic package to what would have been possible" with the parcels 
by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
One of the parcels, known as Monarch Beach, was purchased from a real estate 
partnership that included David Stein, Barry Brief and the hotel operator 
Hemmeter Corp. for a reported $130 million. The 115-acre Dana Headlands 
property was purchased from the Chandler-Sherman Corp. for a reported $115 
million. 
</P>
<P>
James Kelley, a Newport Beach-based hotel consultant, said the high prices 
garnered for the Monarch Beach and Chandler-Sherman properties reflects a 
tremendous ongoing demand for resort sites on the coast. "There is nothing to 
indicate that demand for coastal resorts has been satisfied in Southern 
California," he said. "Offshore investors in particular have placed an 
extremely high value on coastal resorts." 
</P>
<P>
Last March, Qintex announced that two Japanese firms -- Mitsui &amp; Co. and 
Nippon Shinpan Co. -- had purchased a 49% stake in the three existing Mirage 
resorts for $350 million. Skase said Friday that it was "likely they would be 
present" in the Orange County project but there had been no final 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
Both properties have already received approvals for resort development, a key 
factor in making them attractive to Qintex. Skase also said the company was 
impressed with the enormous growth of Orange County and its proximity to major 
population centers and attractions such as Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex, which the dapper 40-year-old Skase built from scratch, owns Australia's 
largest television network and will soon complete the purchase of the United 
Artists film operations from MGM in a deal that will cost the Australian 
company $600 million.

<P>
B OF A DECIDES TO CUT ITS PRIME RATE TO 10.5%

<TEXT>
<P>
Bank of America announced Friday that it will trim its prime lending rate half 
a percentage point to 10.5% because of its own declining borrowing costs and 
further signs of a weakening economy. 
</P>
<P>
The move, effective Monday, follows that of Chase Manhattan Bank, which on July 
10 dropped its prime to the same level, the second such decline in as many 
months and the level at which the prime stood at the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect most other major banks to follow the lead of the nation's 
second-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure Increasing 
</P>
<P>
Chase took the first step when it followed bellwether Southwest Bank of St. 
Louis and cut its prime rate to 10.5% on July 10. A few of smaller banks -- 
most notably NCNB Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C. -- joined Chase, but major 
money center banks had held at 11% until B of A's move. 
</P>
<P>
When other major banks did not immediately follow Chase, analysts suggested 
that the institutions were waiting to see a more definitive step by the Federal 
Reserve to ease credit. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure has been increasing on the banks to lower their rates because the Fed 
is indeed easing credit and mortgage interest rates fell last month to their 
lowest level in more than two years, prompting a rush of new loan applications. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed signaled a looser credit policy early this week by not fighting the 
closely watched federal funds rate as it fell to 9.125%. By Friday, the rate 
was at 8.938%. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America's chief economist, John Oliver Wilson, cited the falling 
federal funds rate and signs of a slowing economy as the main reasons for its 
move. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yields Lower 
</P>
<P>
The prime rate, the rate used as a benchmark by banks for determining various 
other lending rates, is a key rate for consumers because many home equity loans 
and other consumer loans are pegged to it. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the Federal Reserve has shown signs of loosening its grip on the 
nation's money supply in reaction to a continued slowdown in economic growth 
and an easing of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting banks' continued dropping costs of funds, the average yield on 
six-month certificates of deposit fell to a national average of 8.47% last 
week, compared to 8.52% the previous week and the 8.8% range in late June, 
according to Bank Rate Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
In the bond market, another indicator of general interest rate trends, the 
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond finished at about 7.98% Friday, its first 
close below 8% since April 8, 1987.

PERSONAL INCOME EDGES UP 0.3% IN JUNE

<TEXT>
<P>
Personal income rose a lackluster 0.3% in June as consumer spending, after 
adjusting for inflation, declined for a second straight month, the government 
said Friday in a report that renewed recession fears. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, after taking inflation into 
account, edged down 0.1% in June following a 0.2% May decline. It marked the 
first back-to-back monthly declines in spending since September and October, 
1987, a period when consumer confidence was shaken by the stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, 
has been the driving force behind the record peacetime expansion, now in its 
seventh year. But economists are fearful that consumers, worried about their 
economic prospects, could begin to cut back sharply on their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department report said personal income grew a modest 0.3% in June 
following an even smaller 0.2% May increase. The gains were the weakest this 
year and reflected in part a slowdown in job growth, which has sent the 
unemployment rate edging upward. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy, here at midyear, is beginning to flirt with a recession," said 
Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. "We are seeing consumers' 
spending power being squeezed by higher inflation at the same time that pent-up 
demand for big-ticket items is pretty much exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Predicts Rebound 
</P>
<P>
The government reported Thursday that the overall economy, as measured by the 
gross national product, expanded at a sluggish annual rate of 1.7% in the 
April-June quarter, the slowest pace in almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration insists that growth will rebound in the second half of 
the year, fueled by lower interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
But Sinai said he believes that the sluggish growth will intensify, leading to 
rising unemployment in coming months and further weakening consumer confidence. 
He predicted that the economy would enter a mild recession either late this 
year or early in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Further Easing' 
</P>
<P>
David Jones, chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., said he felt 
that the country would be able to skirt through this period of sluggish growth 
without a full-fledged downturn, helped in large part by further moves by the 
Fed to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank earlier this week acted for the third time since June to ease 
credit. Jones said the rapid pacing of these interest-lowering moves 
demonstrated how worried the Fed is about a possible recession. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed is concerned that some interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, 
such as autos and housing, are still quite weak," Jones said. "This will lead 
to further easing on the Fed's part in August." 
</P>
<P>
Before adjusting for inflation, consumer spending was unchanged at an annual 
rate of $3.44 trillion in June following a modest 0.3% increase in May. 
</P>
<P>
The key income category of wages and salaries was up 0.5% in June but this was 
in part a bounce back after wage income was essentially unchanged in May.

If you own municipal bonds, watch out. You may be in for some rude shocks in 
the next two to four years, as many bonds you thought would pay you juicy 
yields for years may be "called" away from you. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't act, you may lose interest earnings or be subject to an unwanted 
tax liability. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect a record amount of municipal bonds -- as many as one out of 
every three outstanding issues -- may be called in the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, a bond is called when the municipality that issued it decides to 
redeem it -- to buy it back at a preset price -- before it reaches maturity. 
Issuers put this contingency in their bond agreements, allowing for the 
possibility of interest rates falling so low that they can float new bonds 
paying lower interest rates. That saves them money. Usually, issuers put in 
provisions allowing them to call bonds after seven to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, even though you may think your bond expires past the year 2000, it may 
really expire next year if it's called. And if you own muni bonds through unit 
trusts -- packages of bonds sold to investors in units of $1,000 or $5,000 -- 
part of your capital will be returned to you and the yield on the remaining 
investment will fall. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds most susceptible to being called will be those issued in the early 1980s, 
most at rates exceeding 8%, says C. Richard Lehmann, president of the Bond 
Investors Assn., a nonprofit organization based in Miami. Since municipal bonds 
issued today yield only 6% to 7%, it pays for the issuers to call those old 
bonds. Many municipalities have already decided to do so by floating new bonds 
to replace them through a process dubbed "advance refunding." 
</P>
<P>
Many corporate bonds also are expected to be called, but this may be less of a 
concern to you because individual investors tend not to hold corporate bonds 
directly. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a flood of bond calls is great news for Wall Street brokerages. 
They will earn sales commissions from investors seeking to reinvest money they 
receive when bonds are called. And they'll reap more profits from underwriting 
an expected flood of new issues, reviving an otherwise laggard market for new 
bond offerings. 
</P>
<P>
But for you, the bondholder, calls are bad news. First, you generally won't be 
able to reinvest in new bonds or unit trusts with yields as high as your old 
bonds carried. 
</P>
<P>
Second, it could be a hassle. If you happen to hold so-called bearer bonds that 
are unregistered with the bond trustee, you could lose interest earnings. That 
would happen if your bonds are called and you don't know about it. You'll wait 
six months to find out your interest coupons are no longer honored, and you'll 
lose the use of your money to earn interest in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
Third, you could face unwanted tax implications. If you bought bonds when 
originally issued, and thus paid face value, you may be subject to unwanted 
capital gains taxes. That's because bonds generally are called at a premium 
above the issue price (usually about 2% to 3% higher). 
</P>
<P>
However, if you bought already issued bonds, you may have paid a premium for 
them far above the face value. Then you may face capital losses. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some tips on how to cope with calls of your bonds: 
</P>
<P>
* Review your portfolio. Find the first call dates and call prices as well as 
the current market value of your bonds. Call provisions should be on your bond 
certificate. Or call your broker or bond trustee. 
</P>
<P>
* Determine if you should sell now. You might want to sell if you think 
interest rates will fall further in the next few years. Thus, you can reinvest 
your money now at current yields. You also might want to sell now if you expect 
to earn capital gains through the calls and also have capital losses from other 
investments. You can use those losses to offset the gains for tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
But keep in mind that if you sell now, most likely you will pay a sales 
commission. Waiting until your bond is called generally will allow you to avoid 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
* Make certain that you don't miss a call. If you have bearer bonds, consider 
registering them, suggests Zane B. Mann, publisher of the California Municipal 
Bond Advisor, a Palm Springs newsletter. That way you will be notified 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
As an additional precaution, you can register with the Bond Investors Assn. at 
15327 N.W. 60th Ave., No. 240, Miami Lakes, Fla. 33014. For $1 per bond issue, 
they will notify you if your issues are called. 
</P>
<P>
* Start thinking about how you will reinvest. If the idea of calls revolts you, 
consider buying Treasury securities. They cannot be called. 
</P>
<P>
What if you own bonds through mutual funds or unit trusts? There's not much you 
can or need to do, says Ralph G. Norton, editor of Muni Bond Fund Report, a 
Huntington Beach newsletter. However, mutual funds offer the least hassle: They 
will handle the calls and reinvest your money for you.

SEARCHES, DRUG USE AT POP CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been going to concerts in California at various theaters since 1965. 
Many times at concerts I attended -- especially rock concerts -- there were 
various drugs evident such as alcohol, pills, pot, etc. I was always aware of 
it and chose not to participate but rather to ignore it. (After all, I had 
spent good money to see the show and didn't want to be like Dr. Hook, who 
sings, "I got stoned and I missed it."). 
</P>
<P>
This seemed fine until this summer, when my daughter went to two different 
concerts at the Pacific Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
The first one was the Beach Boys. When she went in, they searched her bag and 
made her throw away her unopened packages of M&amp;Ms and Cracker Jack. 
</P>
<P>
The second one was Jimmy Buffett. When the lights went down and the show 
started, you could immediately smell the strong odor of marijuana in the air. 
This really surprised my daughter. Then the people in front of us began passing 
a joint, and she really couldn't believe it. She said she thought that it was 
illegal. I said yes, it was. She then asked why they weren't being arrested. I 
said I didn't know. She said she couldn't understand why they made her throw 
away her M&amp;Ms and Cracker Jack but let people in with illegal drugs and 
allowed them to use them in plain sight. 
</P>
<P>
This made me wonder about our values and what message we as responsible adults 
are sending to our children. For the past 24 years, I have turned my head the 
other way because I wasn't participating and didn't want to get involved. (Live 
and let live.) The theater owners/management turn their heads because it might 
cost them money to have a reputation that you can't have fun and do drugs at 
the Pacific. (After all, it's easier and cheaper to treat the possession of 
M&amp;Ms, rather than of drugs, like a crime.) 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement turns its head because these are just petty drug users who 
usually don't do anyone else any harm. But isn't it true that if we didn't have 
any petty drug users, we wouldn't need any big drug dealers? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe someone can explain this paradox in values to my daughter. I know I 
can't.

 A spokeswoman for the Pacific Amphitheatre responded: "Standard security 
policy at all the venues is that people may not bring food in. But in this 
case, a security guard may have been a little overzealous. As for drugs, we 
don't encourage or condone that. Security is a visual check -- they can't go 
through everything. If a patron sees someone (using drugs) and complains, 
absolutely something will be done about it."

UNSCHEDULED STOP LANDS TRASH TRUCK INSIDE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Martha Rodriguez was starting another typical day early Friday, talking on the 
phone with her mother, when she looked out her bedroom window and saw a white 
and blue garbage truck coming toward her house in National City. 
</P>
<P>
Then she heard the loud crunch and felt the shake of a huge truck smashing into 
her living room. Rodriguez threw down the phone and screamed, calling for her 
4-year-old son, who was watching television in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
But the little boy, Armando, was not hurt. Neither were his sisters, Cynthia, 
10, and Maritza, 13, who were in their bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
National City Fire Marshal Patti Schiff said the driver of the Alto Waste Corp. 
garbage truck, Juan Naverez, had just finished emptying one dumpster shortly 
before 9:30 a.m. in the apartment complex across the street and was about to 
proceed to the next one when he accidentally put the truck in reverse. Before 
Naverez, who was in the cab of the truck, could react, the truck had rolled 
down the steep driveway and into Rodriguez's living room, Schiff said. 
</P>
<P>
Next-door neighbor Raul Mendoza said he felt the ground move and heard screams 
coming from the house. He ran outside to see the garbage truck covered in 
rubble from the house and heard Rodriguez calling for her son, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While other neighbors, shouting through the window, urged the distraught mother 
to come out of the house, Mendoza and the truck driver's helper looked for the 
boy amid the debris. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mendoza, the boy was under the sofa, unharmed but scared. 
</P>
<P>
The three children are staying with Rodriguez's mother in Spring Valley while 
Rodriguez and her husband, Arnoldo, find a another place to stay until the 
house is repaired. The National City Fire Department has declared it unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that, even if the house can be fixed, she would rather move 
because a similar accident almost happened once before. About a year ago, a car 
coming out of an apartment development across the street backed all the way 
into her front yard, barely missing the front door. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think that I am ever going to sit in that living room again?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the structure and contents were estimated at $30,000, Schiff said.

CHILLING TRIP IN THE SPEED LANE

"i was born in tulsa oklahoma in 1943. when i was sixteen i started shooting 
amphetamine. i shot with my friends everyday for three years and then left town 
but i've gone back through the years. once the needle goes in it never comes 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Larry Clark, from the introduction to his photo exhibit and book, "Tulsa" 
</P>
<P>
"Tulsa," a photographic chronicle of life and death among amphetamine users, is 
not a pretty picture. But for San Diego, the country's speed capital, "Tulsa" 
may be a chillingly appropriate one. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition's unfolding series of images at the Photowest/W. Bradley Lemery 
Gallery amounts to a documentary portrait of seemingly innocent, all-American 
youths who took a wrong turn growing up and hit the speed lane. Photographer 
Larry Clark, himself an acknowledged drug abuser, made these pictures of 
friends in his Oklahoma hometown 
</P>
<P>
between 1963 and 1971. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and '70s, speed was a hot drug-culture chemical. The drug has 
become popular again, replacing crack and cocaine because of its ready 
availability and low cost, drug enforcement officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs about amphetamine use in the '60s seem to fit present-day San 
Diego County, which accounted for 25% of all methamphetamine labs seized in the 
United States in 1986, according to federal records. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine anyone not being moved viscerally by the rawness, 
intensity and ultimate tragedy of these pictures, which gallery owner Lemery 
chose to exhibit as a key example of autobiographical photography. 
</P>
<P>
"For general commercial appeal, these are not the sort of prints people want on 
the wall above the fireplace," Lemery said. "Serious collectors would be 
interested in these prints. In the Monsen collection that was shown at the La 
Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, they had two pieces (from 'Tulsa') in their 
collection. 'Tulsa' is considered one of the major works in . . . a series of 
autobiographical works that were done in the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit's black-and-white images have a relentless, unforgiving quality as 
a compilation of moments in the lives of these Oklahomans. Clark portrays young 
people sticking hypodermic needles in their limbs or, as observers, with their 
eyes gazing uncertainly at their peers. Over time, he shows the cost of such a 
life style in brutality, injuries and deaths. 
</P>
<P>
As in the accompanying book, published in 1971 and recently reissued, the 
exhibition is arranged in chronological order. The first three images are of 
bare-chested teen-age boys. Their faces look bored and tough, yet naive. 
</P>
<P>
Click. Click. Click. Clark records the dissatisfaction with life that drove him 
and his friends to enhance it synthetically. The boys turn to amphetamine, 
making fists of their hands to produce a good vein for the needle. 
</P>
<P>
In one photograph, four boys are having a party. One boy injects himself while 
another snaps a light for a cigarette. One laughs hilariously as if the other, 
who is bending over, had just told a good joke. In the background, hanging over 
a mantel, is a painting of Jesus, looking away from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
In these photographs from the early years, up to 1968, the boys are the ones 
doing the drugs. Clark shows the girls as lacking any semblance of joy. The 
young women sit hunched with legs and arms crossed, turning in on themselves, 
with brooding expressions on their faces. One, in a bouffant hairdo of the 
period, watches the proceedings, a mirthless, silent observer clutching a beer 
in one photograph, a cigarette in another. 
</P>
<P>
The tone changes between 1968 and 1971. A sense of claustrophobia envelops the 
series of photographs. Most of the images are taken inside a house where group 
members live. A crudely lettered cardboard sign, addressed to the police with 
racist comments, is a reaction of the group to an apparent raid on the house. 
</P>
<P>
Violence and death become prevalent themes. Two portraits carry the simple 
caption "dead." A fascination with handguns has pervaded the group. In a series 
of images made using a movie camera, Clark records what appears to be one 
member of the group shooting another with a pistol. In the 1971 section, one 
man carefully aims a pistol at something or someone off camera. 
</P>
<P>
Clark is on the scene when a man is accidentally wounded with a pistol. We see 
the man grimacing in pain on a bed, his pants pulled down, the small thigh 
wound, the blood stains on his trousers, a towel, and nearby, the tiny 
automatic pistol. A woman sits next to him, head bent, apparently distraught. 
</P>
<P>
The lives Clark records increasingly become oriented around drugs, violence and 
sex. Men inject bare-breasted women. One woman, who has welts on her arms in 
one photo, is shown in bed with a huge black eye and a large bruise on her 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Death comes again. A woman who looks to be nine months pregnant is shown bathed 
in the daylight flowing through a window as she applies a hypodermic needle to 
a vein in her arm. On the following page is a woman at a funeral carrying a 
flowering plant. Turn the page and there's an infant in a tiny coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Before the series concludes, Clark shows an apparent renewal of the cycle as 
new faces, younger people, cluster around, administering the needle. Their 
innocence is the same as Clark's friends portrayed in the earliest photographs. 
</P>
<P>
In exhibiting these difficult photographs for sale, Lemery, the gallery's 
proprietor, reveals a genuine passion for art that goes beyond the merely 
commercial. He could easily have found prettier, more saleable art. 
</P>
<P>
"Tulsa" makes the viewer think about the choices available to these young 
people and why they took the path they did. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit continues through Aug. 5 at the gallery, 744 G St., Suite 205.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TAXI SERVICE FOR SENIORS IS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a three-month delay to resolve insurance questions, the Torrance City 
Council voted unanimously this week to award a contract for a city-subsidized 
taxi service for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
A six-month contract for the city's Dial-a-Taxi service was awarded to 
Wilmington Cab Co., which operates similar services for Carson, Lomita, Rancho 
Palos Verdes and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The service, which was requested by senior citizens in Torrance, is expected to 
start Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The annual cost of the service will be about $210,000, with riders paying about 
23% of the cost and the rest coming from the city's share of Proposition A 
transportation funds. 
</P>
<P>
One-way tickets will cost $1.75, with low-income seniors paying 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens will be limited to 20 tickets per month. Tickets enable senior 
citizens to travel to any point within the city limits and to El Camino College 
and eight hospitals outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides that if a cab does not respond to a call within 25 
minutes, the taxi company will pay for the ride.

EMPLOYEE SOUGHT IN SLAYING OF JANITORIAL COMPANY OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a janitorial service was shot and killed in the driveway of his 
Van Nuys home, and police were searching for one of the victim's longtime 
employees as a suspect, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Norris, 49, was shot to death about 10 p.m. Thursday after he walked 
out of his garage to speak to a man in a car in front of his home in the 7100 
block of McLennan Avenue, Detective Jim Vojtecky said. His wife and teen-age 
son were at home at the time of the shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been working in the garage," Vojtecky said of Norris. "The suspect 
drove up and stopped. Norris came out and had a very brief conversation with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Following the conversation, Norris was hit once in the upper body by a shot 
fired from the car and fell to the driveway where he died. The car, a green 
1971 Ford station wagon, sped away. 
</P>
<P>
Police said descriptions of the car and gunman provided by neighbors and other 
evidence led them to look for Richard W. Bullinger, 33, of Reseda, who had an 
ongoing dispute with the victim. He had not been arrested by late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Norris owned Bob's Janitorial Service, which has been based in Canoga Park for 
17 years and serves office buildings, restaurants, bars and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Bullinger had worked for Norris at least 10 years, Detective Pat Anguiano said. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for the shooting was not known, but the two men had an ongoing 
dispute over money, possibly including finances from the business, Anguiano 
said. The two apparently argued earlier Thursday before the shooting, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, police served a search warrant at the house where 
Bullinger lived alone, but they refused to disclose what evidence was taken 
from it.

NO VOTES ON PORTER RANCH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent events regarding the development of the North Valley should disturb all 
of us! 
</P>
<P>
A huge Century City-type commercial development is seeking approval from the 
city. It would generate more than 160,000 car trips a day. Most days the air is 
nauseating. This will make our air deadly! The size of this development is 
unacceptable. Every other council member is fighting to zone down commercial 
property. The councilman is fighting to increase the zoning thirty times over. 
An effort to recall him is under way. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is bad with regard to traffic, the air, the schools and the 
quality of life here.

SCHOOL SITE LAND SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The emergence of a controversy over the sale of school lands after 11 years 
(July 7) is both amazing and amusing. As the owner of a home adjacent to the 
parcel in question, which is known as "Horse Flats," I offer a few 
observations. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness to the school board, the sale of the majority of the land seemed 
appropriate to most observers at the time. The specter of forced busing for 
racial balance was upon us. Enrollments were falling as residents shifted to 
private schools. The board contemplated elaborate transportation plans to meet 
the court requirements. The giant high school complex planned for the site 
seemed unnecessary and would surely have complicated the busing plan, as it 
would have been located in a corner of the city, in an almost all white area, 
with only one access road. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the board made some obvious errors. As should be clear from 
its name, the Porter Ranch Development Co. planned to develop the land, which 
means that everyone involved should have anticipated additional children in the 
area, and the board should have reserved sufficient land for at least an 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the issue of the sale price. The sale was not well advertised. 
The post-sale announcement, which was very small itself, came as a complete 
surprise to most local residents. Even with the negative effects of the busing 
on the attractiveness of the area, home prices were rising rapidly. Horse Flats 
was the last large parcel of essentially flat land left in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Considering both of these factors, I believe that almost anyone who was given 
sufficient notice that the land would be sold for only $1.5 million could have 
assembled the resources to purchase it. Alternatively, a well promoted sale 
would have led to a substantially higher price.

NO VOTES ON PORTER RANCH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am most concerned with the proposed Porter Ranch project. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic generated by this immense project would negatively impact not only 
the northern San Fernando Valley but also our neighboring communities, 
especially Simi. 
</P>
<P>
It is unreasonable to predict that most employees of this "regional center" 
would come from its immediate area. The homes in this area currently are priced 
too high for any but those with a six-figure income. A great number of minimum 
wage employees will be required to keep a center of this size operating. They 
won't be able to afford to live in the new residences surrounding these 
10-story office buildings, but will have to commute from somewhere else. How 
could this possibly be considered a self-contained community? 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Hal Bernson has consistently opposed opening a private segment 
of Winnetka Avenue to facilitate traffic flow because to do so would create 
damage to the rural character of the Monteria Estates area. How can he be less 
concerned about an area which is so much larger and will be environmentally 
impacted in such a major way? The suburban character of the North Valley would 
be exchanged forever for the gridlock common to the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of signatures opposing the Porter Ranch Development project have been 
collected. I do hope the City Council will listen to reasonable fears for the 
quality of life of the residents of the North San Fernando and Simi valleys and 
vote "no" before Bernson's dream of a "city center" becomes a gridlock 
nightmare.

AFTER 6 1/2 YEARS ON DUTY, POLICE DOG IS HANGING UP HIS COLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two dozen Inglewood police officers were jammed in the corner of Jino's Pizza 
shop honoring a legendary colleague who netted more than 1,000 arrests during a 
6 1/2-year career. 
</P>
<P>
The guest of honor, meanwhile, was sitting politely on the floor, begging for a 
piece of pizza crust. 
</P>
<P>
Welz, a 9 1/2-year-old German shepherd whose career officially came to an end 
this month, received the same send-off career officers typically get -- a 
gathering of old friends, a few war stories and a commendation or two. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever anyone retires, they should be recognized," said Detective Joe Suarez 
of the Los Angeles Police Department's Gang Enforcement Team, who was on hand 
to present the dog with a plaque for tracking down a multiple-homicide suspect 
May 16. 
</P>
<P>
Welz sniffed out the armed suspect, who had eluded Los Angeles police officers 
by hiding under a parked car in Inglewood. After taking a rap over the head, 
the dog subdued the suspect until officers arrived. It turned out to be his 
last arrest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beaten, Kicked 
</P>
<P>
"It was just another day at the office for him," said Welz's handler, Sgt. John 
W. Bell. "He's been beaten, kicked and shot at. He's found criminals in the 
most unlikely places -- on roofs, in trees, in cars, where it would take an 
army of officers to find someone, he does it." 
</P>
<P>
Welz, who was born in Germany in 1980, proved his excellence in numerous 
statewide competitions. He became the first canine with the Inglewood Police 
Department to win a gold medal in the statewide Police Olympics and a silver 
medal in the World Games, an international competition. While on duty, the dog 
was known for his fearlessness, his tracking skills and his ability to discern 
the good guys from the bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Welz was the dog that set the standard for the other handlers throughout 
Southern California," said Tony Bairos, a Bakersfield kennel operator who has 
imported German police dogs for departments across the nation. "Welz was the 
envy of many, many handlers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Gentle Side 
</P>
<P>
And while Welz (pronounced Velz) was recognized in law enforcement circles as 
the ultimate street dog, his owner is proud of the other side of his character 
-- his gentleness and "his uncanny ability to make people at ease." 
</P>
<P>
When not sprinting down city streets after gang members, Welz would spend time 
in senior citizen homes, hospitals and schools allowing just about anybody to 
pat him on the head. 
</P>
<P>
"The school kids would say, 'He only bites bad people so I must be good,' " 
Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
The dog began his career with Bell in 1983 at the age of 2 1/2. He is now 9 
1/2, a few months past the usual retirement age for a police dog, and a senior 
citizen in human terms. 
</P>
<P>
Although Welz is still a very good police dog, Bell said, he was beginning to 
slow down and show some signs of age. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adapting to Retirement 
</P>
<P>
Like many who retire, it has taken time for Welz to adjust to the far less 
strenuous life style. When Bell first began leaving the house in the morning 
alone, he said, Welz seemed disappointed and would whine and cry by the front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
But Welz is becoming more mellow, Bell says. He has added a few pounds and is 
beginning to acknowledge his new role as a house pet. 
</P>
<P>
And now it's Bell, a 16-year veteran with the Inglewood police who was recently 
promoted from an officer in the K-9 Corps to a sergeant in the patrol division, 
who has the adjusting to do. 
</P>
<P>
Bell and his four-legged partner were virtually inseparable over the last six 
years. They worked together all day, worked out together on the beach on 
weekends, and on Sunday Welz would sit patiently in the back of the church. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a real steady portion of my life," Bell said. "I've told a lot of 
things to him I wouldn't tell another human being. . . . Who knows? Maybe I'll 
try to sneak him into the office." 
</P>

SAN CLEMENTE TAPS CONSERVATION PLAN AS WATER USE RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Clemente residents and land developers are using water faster than the city 
can get it. 
</P>
<P>
A 10% increase in water use in San Clemente this summer has forced officials to 
launch a major conservation effort, said Greg Morehead, the city's utilities 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of new homes in undeveloped parts of the city appears to be the 
major cause of the 10% increase in water usage, compared to the summer of 1988, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a crisis, but it's a problem," said Morehead. "And when we spot a 
problem, we try to correct it before it becomes a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Morehead said the root of the problem is that water cannot be pumped into the 
Tri-Cities Reservoir, in north San Clemente, as fast as it is being consumed. 
"It's not a drought problem," he said. "The water is available to us, and it's 
coming into the reservoir at the maximum (rate)." 
</P>
<P>
But usage has increased so much that the reservoir's water level never gets 
back to the "comfortable" point, Morehead said. The city put out a 
water-conservation alert to city residents last week. 
</P>
<P>
Interim City Manager Greg Hulsizer said Friday that residents appear to be 
heeding the city's call for more cautious water use. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears we're getting cooperation," Hulsizer said. "What we want to do is 
keep it in the forefront, and do everything we can to save water. For instance, 
we're telling people that reducing the time automatic sprinklers are turned on 
by even one minute a day would be a significant help. That's something that can 
be done quickly and easily." 
</P>
<P>
Morehead said the water-shortage problem came to the city's attention about 
three weeks ago. He said the Tri-Cities Reservoir could not come back to its 
former level, despite constant pumping from the Colorado River and the state's 
aqueduct from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The reservoir, he said, supplies the San Onofre nuclear plant in San Diego 
County, Capistrano Beach, and San Clemente State Beach, as well as the city of 
San Clemente. But he said a check of water usage showed that San Clemente had 
the biggest increase in water usage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the increase in water use in San Clemente is from a number of things, 
and one component is growth," he said. "The major component is water being used 
for the development areas. It takes a lot of water to compact the soil, keep 
dust down and keep new vegetation growing in the development areas. These areas 
are inland, farther from the ocean, and so the temperature is warmer there." 
</P>
<P>
Morehead said developers have been asked to reduce water usage "and they agreed 
to cut back as much as they could without impacting themselves monetarily." 
</P>
<P>
Morehead said the overall goal is to reduce water usage throughout the city by 
10% -- the same amount as the unexpected increase in use this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting good cooperation," Morehead said. "We've even gotten calls from 
people saying 'thank you.' "

EL TORO JETS TO PRACTICE CARRIER LANDINGS AT BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fighter attack aircraft will be practicing simulated aircraft carrier landings 
near the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro in the evening hours next week, 
which may result in increased noise in surrounding neighborhoods, a spokeswoman 
at the station said. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it's something that happens all the time," said a Marine Corps 
spokeswoman. She said the FA-18 Hornet jets based at El Toro hold the practice 
sessions several times a year. They will be landing as if the runway at the air 
base were the deck of an aircraft carrier. 
</P>
<P>
The exercises are scheduled from 8:30 to 10:30 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and 
Wednesday, according to the spokeswoman.

BOY KILLED, 3 HURT IN INTERSECTION CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 6-year-old Fountain Valley boy was killed Friday afternoon in a two-car 
collision in El Toro when the car in which he was riding drove in front of a 
pickup truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Anh (Andrew) Tien Dao died at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in 
Mission Viejo, at 1:15 p.m., about 90 minutes after he was ejected from a car 
at El Toro Road and Normandale Drive, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other two young passengers and the 16-year-old driver of the car, he 
was not wearing a seat belt, police said. The two passengers also were 
seriously injured in the accident, while the driver sustained minor scrapes. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the driver, Phung Nguyen, 16, of El Toro, appears to have stopped 
at a stop sign at the intersection but then drove into the path of a Toyota 
pickup that had the right of way, police said. Nguyen's car was hit broadside, 
ejecting its four passengers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Nguyen) appears to have been at fault, no question about it," said Officer 
Ken Daily of the California Highway Patrol. As is standard procedure in such 
fatalities, Daily said CHP officers will conduct an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen suffered bruises to her face and shoulders and was treated at Mission 
Hospital, a nursing supervisor there said. The passengers, both sisters of 
Nguyen, remained in the hospital Friday night after undergoing surgery. Hanh 
Nguyen, 9, suffered head injuries and was in critical condition, while Cristina 
Nguyen, 11, sustained abdominal injuries and was in serious condition, hospital 
officials said. Dao apparently was not related to them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the pickup truck was not injured, police said.

<P>
CLERK GETS SIGNATURES ON VOSS' RECALL EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 7,000 signatures have been filed with the city clerk in a bid to 
recall Councilman Fred Voss because of his conviction last year on sex 
solicitation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk J.E. deSevren Jacquet said that after her office inspected the 
petitions Thursday, she sent them to the Orange County registrar of voters 
office for a thorough review to determine whether the signatures are valid. 
</P>
<P>
The county has 30 days to check the signatures, she said. If elections workers 
finish the job by Aug. 11, the recall issue can be added to the joint 
consolidated election ballot in November. Otherwise, she said, the matter may 
be decided in a special election in December. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Fountain Valley residents launched the recall drive against Voss, 
52, last March on grounds that his conviction this year for trying to solicit 
sex from a Santa Ana policewoman posing as a prostitute makes him unworthy to 
hold public office. Voss stepped down as mayor but has continued to serve as a 
councilman. Laurann Cook is acting mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Burnett, a leader of the drive, said 77 volunteers worked for weeks to 
obtain the needed signatures. "We were very gratified to finish it up and turn 
it in," she said. "It's just absolutely overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
DeSevren Jacquet said recall backers submitted 7,028 signatures, which exceeds 
the 6,154 required to qualify a ballot item, based on 20% of the registered 
voters in the city.

BROWN'S ATTORNEYS ARE QUITTING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Millionaire David A. Brown's attempts to have county prosecutors for his murder 
trial be replaced by ones from the attorney general's office came to an abrupt 
halt Friday when Brown's own attorneys quit his case. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Joel W. Baruch said in Superior Court in Santa Ana that he and his 
partner, Jack M. Earley, must declare a conflict of interest, but he did not 
say what the conflict is. 
</P>
<P>
It is Baruch who has vehemently argued that county prosecutors are biased 
against Brown because of his involvement in a plot from the jail to have two 
members of the county staff killed. Now it will be up to Brown's new attorneys 
to decide whether to pursue the request for new prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey, who appeared surprised by the sudden 
turn of events, said after a closed-door hearing that he was satisfied that 
there was nothing more he could do to determine either the reasons for the 
conflict Baruch and Earley had declared or to act on it in any other way. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 36, of Anaheim is accused of masterminding a plot involving the fatal 
shooting of his first wife four years ago and letting his daughter, then 14, 
take sole responsibility for the crime. The daughter had served three years of 
a murder sentence when she recanted last year, leading to Brown's arrest last 
August. Last January, Brown was accused of trying while he was in jail to hire 
someone to kill his second wife -- a key witness against him -- and also the 
prosecutor and chief investigator in the murder case involving his first wife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Involvement Admitted 
</P>
<P>
Brown has admitted his involvement in the jail plot but said other inmates had 
set him up. 
</P>
<P>
Reports had been circulating about differences between Brown and Baruch, but 
Baruch said after a court hearing that the reasons he and Earley were leaving 
the case were unavoidable but unrelated to their relationship with their 
client. 
</P>
<P>
"If he'd had any problems with us, he would have fired us," Baruch said. "But 
that's not what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Baruch told the court that the conflict had come up since the last court 
hearing, which was the Friday before. By law, lawyers in most conflict 
situations are not permitted to reveal their reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Most defendants in murder cases cannot afford their own attorneys and must, 
therefore, be represented by court-appointed counsel. Brown, who in recent 
years had been very successful in a computer-related business, hired Baruch and 
Earley on his own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speculation on Replacement 
</P>
<P>
Baruch said Brown will make his decision about hiring a new attorney soon. 
</P>
<P>
Although Baruch said he did not know who the new attorney would be, Baruch was 
seen conferring with C. Thomas McDonald, who will soon complete his duties as 
co-counsel for convicted serial killer Randy Steven Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom would certainly be a good choice for him," was Baruch's limited response 
to speculation about whether McDonald might represent Brown.

STEPPING INTO ANOTHER WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though only a stone's throw from the hurly-burly of the San Diego Freeway in 
southern Orange County, Mission San Juan Capistrano is light years away in 
terms of tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
Hordes of summer tourists visibly slow down, and even speak more softly, as 
they enter the 213-year-old mission. Brian W. McInerey, director of tourism at 
the mission, believes the Old World charm inside the mission makes the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Out there, beyond the mission walls, there are lots of developments and noisy 
progress," he said. "Inside these walls, one is transported back to another 
era. It's calm and peaceful here." 
</P>
<P>
Fountains sparkle in the sunlight, and water splashes melodically. Pigeons and 
a few swallows gracefully fly above the adobe walls. In the gardens, mature 
trees cast cool shade over visitors. 
</P>
<P>
An ancient metal-producing furnace, the first ever built in the far West, shows 
tourists how the California Indians learned that exacting trade more than 200 
years ago. A chapel frequented by Father Junipero Serra invites tourists to 
pause and meditate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a world-class historic site," said Nicholas M. Magalousis, a Chapman 
College professor who is director of archeology at the mission. "It's known 
around the world, and with good reason." 
</P>
<P>
John Loomis, an architect who is working on plans to further protect and 
stabilize the mission, said he always seems in another world while inside the 
walls of its grounds. "It's like stepping back into time," he said.

The three county supervisors up for reelection next year report raising a total 
of about $140,000 in campaign money, according to semiannual finance statements 
filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth of Anaheim, who is so far running unopposed, has the 
largest campaign fund with about $77,000. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who represents Huntington Beach, Seal Beach, 
Westminster, Cypress and Los Alamitos, reported cash resources of $56,662. 
Nobody has formally announced a challenge to Wieder's reelection, but some 
prospective candidates from Huntington Beach have expressed interest in the 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who announced his bid for reelection to a fifth 
term on Thursday, reported cash on hand of about $10,000. One possible 
challenger to Riley is exploring a campaign but has not formally announced. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's district stretches along the county's southern coast from Costa Mesa to 
San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa attorney Dana Reed had formed a campaign committee to seek Riley's 
seat. But Thursday, Reed said he will drop his bid and support Riley. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Dana Reed for Supervisor 1990 committee raised $60,249 
since January and still has a cash balance of $42,984, the records show. Reed 
said Thursday that he will return the money to his contributors when Riley 
files for his office in February. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder said she expects that her race will cost about $250,000. Roth and Riley 
have not announced fund-raising goals. They said the amounts to be raised will 
depend on the amount of competition.

'MOST CHILDREN WHO DROWN WERE LAST SEEN INSIDE THE HOUSE.'; 
</P>
<P>
COUPLE WITH 3 SMALL BOYS BUY SOME PEACE BY FILLING IN POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Gary and Bimmy Keene of Mission Viejo love to swim. 
</P>
<P>
But wary of the risk of drowning or injury for their three toddlers, the Keenes 
made a decision this summer to get rid of their back-yard pool. 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of work, the Keenes said Friday that they hope to have their 
swimming pool completedly filled with gravel and dirt by the end of this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd been thinking about doing something with the pool for some time," said 
Bimmy Keene, 35, a private-practice nurse. "Then the final straw came when we 
saw Barry, who's 3 1/2, climbing over the protective fence by the pool. We 
decided to fill in the pool." 
</P>
<P>
For the past two weeks, tons of gravel and dirt has been dumped into the pool, 
after which it will be landscaped into a regular yard. 
</P>
<P>
The Keenes, who live at 27162 El Retiro, have two other children: Grant, 2, and 
John Paul, 1. The three young boys are energetic handfuls, their mother says. 
And she adds that she and her husband have constantly worried about the danger 
posed by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Our decision to do this has been building up a long time," she said. "My 
husband, Gary, and I love to swim. He used to teach swimming, as a matter of 
fact. But we also have a recreation center pool here in Mission Viejo that's 
near enough for us to use." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Keene, 37, a teacher at Newhart Junior High School in Mission Viejo, said 
the decision has meant quite a bit of hard work. "For a while, we had 100 tons 
of gravel on our driveway, and I was shoveling and hauling that to the back," 
he said. "But we had a lot of good friends helping us. I can tell you that I 
really felt sore on one side the first day, and that's when I learned to shovel 
on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Bimmy Keene said that after she and her husband made the pool-closing decision, 
she called the Orange County Trauma Society for help and guidance. The society, 
based in Orange, is a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing 
injuries and deaths from various traumas, including drowning. 
</P>
<P>
Davine Abbott, the society's program director, said Friday that the 
organization was pleased to help the Keenes. But Abbott emphasized that the 
Trauma Society does not think all pools have to be filled in to make them safe. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our main goals is prevention of deaths by drowning," Abbott said, 
adding that already in 1989, seven Orange County children have died from 
drownings in either swimming pools or spas. "Our society recommends layers of 
protection between the swimming pool and a house," Abbott explained. 
</P>
<P>
"We recommend that sliding glass doors from the house to the pool be 
self-closing and self-latching. We also recommend that a fence be around the 
pool and that it should be five feet high on all sides, with a self-closing, 
self-latching gate. The reason we recommend these layers of protection is 
because most children who drown in pools were last seen inside their house." 
</P>
<P>
Children have ways of quickly getting out of a house and into danger, she 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Bimmy Keene said that the Trauma Society helped her and her husband find donors 
for various materials needed to fill the pool. "We've gotten some wonderful 
donations, and just this morning, the A.G. Sod Co. came to the house and 
donated sod to cover the top of the pool," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Keenes said the neighbors have been helpful and uncritical of the 
disruption during the two weeks of work needed to fill in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
There have been some crank calls, Gary Keene acknowledged. And some of the 
calls have been from those criticizing him for "wasting an economic asset" -- 
the swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that he and his wife have no regrets about their decision. 
"Basically, everything else pales in comparison when one thinks of the 
potential for tragedy that we've removed."

HOWELL KEEPS BEATING UP ON RIGHT-HANDERS; 
</P>
<P>
THIRD BASEMAN HITS 16TH HOMER, FIGURES IN WINNING RALLY WITH SINGLE IN 9TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jack Howell can't help but smile when he sees a right-handed pitcher on the 
opposing team's lineup card, or when a right-handed reliever enters a game. 
</P>
<P>
And Friday night was no exception as Howell went three for four and scored the 
winning run in the ninth inning that was charged to right-handed reliever Donn 
Pall in a 6-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Howell hit his team-leading 16th homer of the season off starter Rich Dotson, a 
right-hander, in the fifth inning to tie the score at 2-2. He also doubled off 
Pall to drive in a run and scored to key a three-run sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Howell's homer was his 15th consecutive against a right-handed pitcher. His 
only homer against a left-hander this season was against Seattle's Dennis 
Powell on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the season I was struggling," Howell said. "I was platooning against 
a lot of good left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I feel a lot better against left-handers. The key against them is 
trying to stay aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Howell, a .228 hitter entering the game, was aggressive in the ninth with the 
score tied at 5-5. He led off against Pall with a single to center, moved to 
third when Dick Schofield reached on a throwing error by White Sox first 
baseman Ivan Calderon and scored on Claudell Washington's sacrifice fly to 
left. 
</P>
<P>
White Sox Manager Jeff Torborg said he thought center fielder Dave Gallagher 
caught Howell's line-drive single in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not see the ball under the glove," Torborg said. "And I did not see the 
ball bounce." 
</P>
<P>
Television replays were inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a series of ups and downs this season where everyone contributed," 
Howell said. "It's been a team effort as well as a few breaks that have kept us 
on a winning streak." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who have won nine of their past 10 games, are 15-1 in games in 
which the left-handed-hitting third baseman has hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Howell belted a 1-2 pitch into the right-field bullpen, his second homer in as 
many nights against the White Sox. He hit a three-run homer in an 8-5 victory 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a nice feeling holding them to a tie going into the ninth," 
Howell said of Friday night's game. "That way I could be a lot more aggressive. 
I didn't have to try to hit a home run, but just get a hit and get on base." 
</P>
<P>
Howell's homer was his seventh of the month. He also has driven in 16 runs in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
And he has produced those numbers while hitting from the No. 8 spot in the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader said the bottom third of the Angels' lineup -- Lance 
Parrish, Howell and shortstop Dick Schofield -- has been productive. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason they're down there is not because they can't hit," he said. "It's 
because we're trying to play nine innings of offense. Without their production, 
you'll get only five innings of offense if you're lucky."

ONE WAVE AFTER ANOTHER; 
</P>
<P>
FIVE MCNULTY BROTHERS HAVE NEVER BEEN FAR FROM SURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe McNulty's earliest childhood memories weren't of playing on a swing set 
with his four older brothers in the back yard of their home in Capistrano 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We never even had anything like a swing set or a basketball hoop in our yard," 
he said. "All we did was surf." 
</P>
<P>
With the pounding waves of the Pacific Ocean only a few feet from his back 
door, Joe was a reluctant student of the surfing game. But to keep up with his 
brothers, he had no choice but to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really funny," said Brian McNulty, Joe's brother and a regular on the 
pro surfing tour. "We couldn't get Joe to surf. I already was surfing in 
contests. It seemed he had a vengeance against surfing. We kept bugging him and 
bugging him, but he wouldn't try it." 
</P>
<P>
But one day Brian returned from a competition and saw his brother riding a 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally gave in," Joe said. "I went out on my own and I got hooked." 
</P>
<P>
"Now he's the most hard-core surfer in the family," Brian said. 
</P>
<P>
The playful days of youth have come and gone for the McNulty brothers, but not 
their free spirit. Outsiders view surfing as the last refuge of the free 
spirit. But for the McNultys, it has been a family bond. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really easy growing up," Brian said. "We all got along pretty good. We 
all had one thing in common with surfing. We could all relate to each other 
through that." 
</P>
<P>
A product of their environment, the McNultys are to surfing in the 1980s what 
the Wilson brothers were to singing about surfing in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Brian, 25, has been in the surfing spotlight the longest. He's ranked 32nd in 
the world and is in his fourth year on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals tour. 
</P>
<P>
Sean, the oldest brother at 28, enjoyed modest success on the world tour before 
retiring in 1984. He now leases commercial real estate in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Jr., 26, a former top amateur, commutes between Capistrano Beach and 
Hesperia and works in real estate development. 
</P>
<P>
Joe, 19, and Terence, 21, represent the family's new breed of surfers. Terence 
is in his first year as a pro and Joe is a top amateur. 
</P>
<P>
McNulty family reunions are a rarity, which is why this weekend will be special 
for them. Brian and Terence will participate in the Op Pro Surfing 
Championships, which start Monday at Huntington Beach. Joe will compete in the 
Op Junior portion for top amateurs. Pat and Sean will be in town to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good time for us because the pro tour is in California," Joe said. "We 
haven't spent Christmas together for eight years. There's always one, two or 
three of us gone." 
</P>
<P>
But for many years, the McNulty household was full of surfboards and young 
surfers. 
</P>
<P>
"We grew up in a neighborhood with a lot of famous people in surfing and water 
sports," Brian said. "Hobie Alter grew up here. A lot of surf stars, like Jerry 
Lopez and James Jones, stayed at (neighbor) Gordon Clark's house." 
</P>
<P>
With the brothers off chasing waves and real estate deals, their mother, Mary, 
lives in peace and quiet in the family's five-bedroom home in Capistrano Beach. 
Brian is with the world tour eight months of the year and Joe and Terence live 
in San Clemente and are busy traveling to area contests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tough on mom," Brian said. "She isn't too happy with us right now 
because we all left and there's no one at the house." 
</P>
<P>
Mary said she's enjoying the solitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Raising five boys was a snap," she said. "Although it had its moments. I knew 
what to expect with the boys. After one or two, there were no surprises. Their 
affinity with the ocean made it much easier to raise them." 
</P>
<P>
The McNultys' interest in surfing budded from their father, the late Pat Sr., 
who was editor of Surfer magazine from 1967-69. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad was a complete water man," Brian said. "We had boards, a catamaran and 
kayaks." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Sr. died of a heart attack in 1971, leaving Mary to keep the family 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a few rough years after dad died," Pat Jr. said. "Mom took over the 
leadership. She was in charge, but we all helped out." 
</P>
<P>
Joe was 2 when Pat Sr. died. He turned to the oldest McNulty, Sean, to fill his 
father's role. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the elder statesman," Joe said. "He kept us in line when mom couldn't. 
He was at the age he knew he had take responsibility. He was the marshal." 
</P>
<P>
Brian said his mother gave the brothers "a lot of room to grow when we were 
young." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any strong curfews or strict upbringing," Brian said. "We had 
strong morals. We knew right from wrong." 
</P>
<P>
When they didn't, Mary used a variety of disciplinary actions. After one of 
Brian's worst teen-age transgressions, she exiled him to tennis camp in Big 
Bear during the week of qualifying for the world amateur surfing championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how I ever got the guts to do that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She even went so far as to ground the boys from the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"She tried that a couple of times," Brian said. "But it didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
As the boys grew older, they began to develop interests outside surfing. Sean 
went off to college for two years, then tried the pro surfing circuit. Pat was 
dabbling in real estate by the time he was 20. Joe played baseball and surfed 
with Terence as much as he could. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe and Terence were so close in age it was almost like they grew up as 
twins," Mary said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brian's surfing career began to blossom. As an amateur, he was named 
to the National Scholastic Surfing Assn. team twice. He helped San Clemente 
High School to the state surfing championship as a senior and Saddleback 
College to the state college title after becoming the individual California 
college champion. 
</P>
<P>
But his pro career hasn't developed as smoothly. His best finish was fourth at 
the Pipeline Masters on Hawaii's North Shore in 1986, his first year on the 
world tour. 
</P>
<P>
"My first year I was trying too hard to be perfect and my performance 
suffered," he said. "The second year I went for a more radical approach and I 
made a lot of little mistakes. Last year I tore ligaments in my (right) ankle, 
which slowed me down. This year I'm trying to take a little bit of each 
approach from the past and see how it works." 
</P>
<P>
Brian's finish at the Op Pro Championships could drastically affect his world 
ranking. The competition has been billed as the "Super Bowl of Surfing" and has 
drawn competitors such as two-time world-champions Tom Curren and Tom Carroll 
and defending world-champion Barton Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't broken into the top 30 yet," Brian said. "So you could still say I'm 
an underdog. It's been hard on me from a ratings standpoint. This year's really 
important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Brian can find competition in his family, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Opinions differ on who's the best surfing McNulty. Pat says Brian. Brian says 
it could be Joe or Terence, given time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're competitive with each other," Brian said of his younger brothers. "But 
it makes me happy to see them surfing so good. They have a great future." 
</P>
<P>
Terence, whose best finish is seventh on the pro tour this year, has trouble 
deciding who's best. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say," Terence said. "Sean is out of his prime now. He was 
definitely a good competitor. Brian can handle some big waves, and Joe is 
coming into his own. Joe's powerful on the medium waves. Brian is definitely 
more developed than Joe and I are. 
</P>
<P>
"We always joke around and say Pat's the businessman of the family who doesn't 
surf. But he's into what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Brian said the brothers' personalities show in their surfing. 
</P>
<P>
"Sean is really good at the large waves," Brian said. "He was one of the best 
out there in Hawaii. He had a real powerful style that worked well. Joe surfs a 
lot like Sean, he has strong legs and works on the big waves." 
</P>
<P>
Pat, Brian says, has a more laid-back style. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat doesn't rip or tear through a wave," Brian said. "He's not really flashy, 
but he's smoother." 
</P>
<P>
The question of who's the best surfer likely will rise at McNulty family 
reunions in years to come. And just what will one find at a McNulty reunion in, 
say, 30 years? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably a lot of grandchildren," Terence said. "There definitely would be a 
lot of kids running around." 
</P>
<P>
Will the brothers still be surfing? 
</P>
<P>
"You bet," Terence said. "It's more of a lifetime sport than something like 
football."

FIRST HOSPITAL CORP. SHARPLY CUTS OFFER FOR COMPREHENSIVE CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comprehensive Care Corp., the nation's largest provider of hospital drug and 
alcohol treatment services, announced Friday that First Hospital Corp. 
drastically cut the price under what it had previously agreed to pay for the 
faltering Irvine company. 
</P>
<P>
First Hospital's action forced Comp Care to look for financing that would allow 
the company to stay open in the event the merger fails. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking the financing and other things necessary to keep the company 
operating if the merger would not be approved," said Stephen R. Munroe, Comp 
Care chief financial officer. He refused to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care's stock fell $2.125 Friday, closing at $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
First Hospital, which is based in Norfolk, Va., cut the cash portion of its 
$130-million bid from $5 a share to $3 a share and said Comprehensive Care is 
free to entertain other offers. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies had announced in April their intention to merge. They were to 
become a new public company called FHC Comp Care, and plans called for Comp 
Care to move its headquarters to Virginia.

"Obviously, First Hospital got a closer look at the financial condition of the 
company," said Jeffrey Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities in Costa 
Mesa. "Comp Care doesn't have time to go out to seek another buyer. This makes 
the company very vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care reported Friday that it lost $5.1 million for the fourth quarter 
ended May 31, contrasted with a profit of $2.4 million for the same period a 
year earlier. Sales for the quarter fell 5% to $51.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the year ended May 31, Comp Care earned $502,000, contrasted with nearly $9 
million earned for fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The blame for the fourth-quarter loss was placed in part on a steady decline in 
the number of people checking into the company's alcohol and drug treatment 
centers and on the shorter stays among the people who did check in. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has been an increase in competition, something Comp Care saw little 
of for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care operates its CareUnit alcohol and drug dependency programs under 
contracts at 170 hospitals across the country. The firm also owns 23 hospitals 
in 10 states, among them facilities in Brea, Orange and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The occupancy rate in some of the Comp Care facilities fell from 66% for the 
fourth quarter of 1988 to 57% for that period this year, the company reported 
Friday. The company said further that it does not expect that figure to improve 
for the next quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care said Friday that it had agreed to sell its corporate headquarters and 
intends to sell some land it owns in Miami. The buyer for the Irvine building 
was not disclosed.

HITS 3.4% IN JUNE; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY'S JOBLESS RATE RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Orange County jumped to 3.4% in June, its highest 
reading since last July, but it was still the state's third lowest, behind 
Marin and San Mateo counties. The jobless rate was 3.1% in May. 
</P>
<P>
The state Employment Development Department reported 46,500 people out of work 
in the month, up from 42,000 in May. There were 1.17 million jobs in the county 
for June, up from 1.16 million last month. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in unemployment was probably due to the seasonal influx of 
students into the work force.

SINGER'S TURF IN SAN CLEMENTE HOSTS A GRASS-ROOTS SERIES FOR FOLK MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Dennis Roger Reed slings on his acoustic guitar Sunday and opens a free 
folk music concert in a San Clemente park, he will bring new meaning to the 
idea of playing on familiar turf. 
</P>
<P>
Reed certainly knows the terrain at Max Berg Plaza Park, the scene of the 
late-afternoon show. As park maintenance supervisor for the city of San 
Clemente, it is his job to see that the large rectangle of grass, palm trees, 
walkways and playground equipment is kept mown and litter-free. 
</P>
<P>
When he isn't overseeing the upkeep of about 80 acres of city parkland, Reed 
moonlights as a country-bluegrass singer and songwriter who has made a good 
impression locally with clever lyrics and a humorous performing style. 
</P>
<P>
As prime mover behind San Clemente's new "Summer Concerts in the Park" series, 
Reed has merged his vocation as a picker of bluegrass with his career as a 
groundskeeper. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said he first got the idea for a city-sponsored folk music series last 
winter while watching his friends in the local traditional British folk band, 
Blackthorn, play a concert at the Old Dana Point Cafe. Reed watched as some 
children, fascinated by the group's acoustic instruments, went to the bandstand 
during a break to ask questions and learn something about traditional music. 
</P>
<P>
'I figured, 'This is a nice thing that's being passed on here,' " recalled 
Reed, a tall, deep-voiced man who wears his hair in a style far more typical of 
musicians than public servants -- spiky and short on top, over the shoulders in 
back. "You don't get that on MTV or hear it on the radio dial," Reed said. "I 
thought we might try to bring people to the park for a different kind of music 
than they normally would listen to." 
</P>
<P>
Reed soon found a way to apply his idea. He was enrolled at the time in a 
special management training program for San Clemente city workers. Putting 
together the concert series was his way of fulfilling the program's required 
project. 
</P>
<P>
City officials backed up the folk-concert idea with a small budget that, 
according to Reed, is less than $1,000 for the three shows. Rather than do 
anything fancy with the concert site, Reed decided to put most of the money 
toward paying the performers he recruited. 
</P>
<P>
When the first show came about last month, Reed said, the day's headliner, 
bluegrass bandleader Andy Rau wasn't thrilled at the accommodations: for a 
stage, a flat-bed trailer borrowed from the city street department, and for a 
dressing room, the park's concrete-walled public lavatory. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'This is the stage? This is the dressing room?' I said, 'Would you 
rather have the money in your pocket?' He said, 'That's fine.' " 
</P>
<P>
About 250 people turned out for that first Sunday afternoon show, Reed said. 
Partly as a favor to him, he said, the acts this year are playing for less than 
their usual rate. Reed is playing for free as opening act for Granuaile, a 
Celtic folk trio whose members play regularly at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Reed's early exposure to country and bluegrass music came while he was a small 
boy growing up in Buena Park and Fullerton. His father, who came from Arkansas, 
would take him to see country and bluegrass bands. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my earliest memories is being held by those performers," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was in junior high school, Reed was playing guitar, but his 
inspiration came from the Beatles, rather than bluegrass bands. "At 12, the 
Beatles came over and I was embarrassed to be watching guys in cowboy hats," he 
said. But by the late '60s, bands such as Buffalo Springfield and Poco had 
shown Reed and everybody else that there was common ground between rock and 
country music. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, who settled in San Clemente 12 years ago, fronted a rock band until a few 
years ago, when he became disillusioned with the rock-club circuit. Then he 
began making contacts at the Shade Tree, a stringed-instrument shop that is a 
south county grapevine for folk musicians. At a seminar there he met Steve 
Gillette, a veteran songwriter and recording artist who encouraged Reed to 
start shopping his songs in country music circles. So far, Reed said, his 
publisher has gotten his work heard by the likes of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, 
Dwight Yoakam and New Grass Revival. For now, Reed is still awaiting his first 
"cut" -- a recording of one of his songs by an established performer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he and his band, which includes his brother, Don, on lead guitar, 
have been emerging with shows at the Shade Tree and area folk festivals and 
bluegrass contests. The group, which recently changed names from the Old 
Bohemians to the Dennis Roger Reed Band, is a fixture at the Tuesday night 
bluegrass soirees at the Old Dana Point Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
"My vacations are almost always musical vacations," Reed said of his 
double-life in bluegrass and bureaucracy. "And I'm learning that I can survive 
some times on less sleep than I should." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Roger Reed and Granuaile play Sunday at 5:30 p.m. at Max Berg Plaza 
Park, at the end of El Portal Street in San Clemente. Admission: free. 
Information: (714) 361-8264.

Don Cribb, the Santa Ana resident who formed the 16-member Santa Ana Council of 
Arts and Culture in December, has a new project in the works -- an exhibit of 
the "high-tech" works of Los Angeles artist David Hockney that will open Sept. 
2 at the Modern Museum of Art in Santa Ana. Cribb, who owns an antiques 
conservation business in Los Angeles, said he has been a friend of Hockney's 
since the late '60s. The 59 photo-collages and recent prints in the show will 
come mostly from Hockney's own collection. Included are a group of color laser 
prints of some of his paintings and experimental prints produced on a Canon 
copier and a FAX machine. The exhibit's emphasis is due to the widespread 
Orange County interest in technology and information dissemination, Cribb said, 
adding that he wanted the show to be in Santa Ana because he believes that 
"there should be a major (contemporary art) presence in central county." 
Educational materials for the exhibit will be developed by Hockney's studio, 
Cribb said. The approximately $25,000 cost of the show, which closes Nov. 6, 
will be funded by Parducci Wine Cellars.

FISHING CLUB STRESSES CONSERVATION, THE FUN OF ANGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE, Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tucked away beside the fuel dock near the Balboa Pavilion is a one-room 
cottage, so small and unpretentious that most folks never give it a second 
glance. Yet, it is home to one of the largest fishing clubs in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Balboa Angling Club was founded in 1926 by about 75 avid fishermen. During 
the 63 years of its existence, the club has grown to include 1,000 members, 
ranging from kids to senior citizens. And it has earned an international 
reputation, thanks in large part to the dozens of world records in salt-water 
game fishing held by members like Gil Kraemer, whose picture hangs in a 
prominent spot on the back wall of the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Kraemer, last year's president, caught a whopping 1,062-pound blue marlin in 
the waters off Hawaii and now holds the world record for the largest billfish. 
The club has come to expect this kind of big-league fishing from its members. 
Yet, as Helen Smith is quick to point out, there is a lot more to the Balboa 
Angling Club than bringing home a big fish. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, club secretary and official fish weigher for the past 29 years, likes to 
remind visitors that the club was originally founded to promote conservation. 
Members release most of the marlin they catch, she says. "We were one of the 
forerunners in tagging and releasing." 
</P>
<P>
The club holds one of the largest released marlin tournaments in Southern 
California -- the Master Billfish Tournament, which this year takes place Sept. 
6 through 10. The tournament usually draws about 75 boats, ranging in size from 
18-foot Boston Whalers to 95-foot fishing yachts. The range in boat sizes 
reflects the economic mix of the club membership, Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not like a yacht club. We have a lot of people who are not rich in this 
club. The little guy can compete along with the guy with a lot of money. And 
we've got lots of rich people in the club, too." 
</P>
<P>
To join the club, anglers must pay a one-time entry fee of $50 and a yearly fee 
of $80 for singles, $115 for families and $15 for juniors. Lifetime memberships 
cost $1,000. Prospective members must be recommended by a current member. 
</P>
<P>
The clubhouse, managed by Helen Smith, the organization's only paid staff 
member, is open Thursday through Sunday. Smith, whose husband formerly operated 
a commercial sportfishing boat, says she got the job nearly 30 years ago 
because she "knew fishing, knew office work and knew how to talk on the 
(marine) radio." 
</P>
<P>
At work in her small, waterfront office, with its commanding view of Newport 
Harbor, Smith fields phone calls from members wanting the latest fish reports. 
"Don't forget to look under the kelp patties for yellowtail," she told a recent 
caller. She also prepares -- and frequently updates -- a recorded fish report 
that is available 24 hours a day by dialing (714) 673-3520. 
</P>
<P>
One of her most important duties is weighing in the day's catches. "I'll even 
take their picture," she says. "Many years ago, I used to have to come down at 
1 or 2 in the morning and weigh in the fish, but my husband won't let me come 
down after 9 anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Before the permanent clubhouse was built in 1947, club members weighed their 
fish at a dock between the Pavilion and the ferry crossing. But in 1947, 41 
members bought $100 certificates to finance construction of the current 
clubhouse, pier and an official weigh station that serves all Newport Harbor, 
including non-club members. The biggest fish Smith remembers weighing was a 
600-pound broadbill swordfish. 
</P>
<P>
Every summer the club runs a junior angling tournament that is open to the 
public. The 37th annual tournament, which began June 17, will continue through 
Aug. 20 and is open to boys and girls under 16. Contest rules are available at 
the Balboa Angling Club or at most local fish weigh-in stations. (For 
information dial (714) 673-6316.) 
</P>
<P>
Smith says the tournament is designed to "get the kids out fishing" for the 
summer. One "kid" named Jock Albright began fishing with the club 25 years ago 
and is still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 9 when I joined the club," says Albright, who now serves as club 
treasurer. For Albright, the appeal of fishing is in the sport itself -- not 
the catch. 
</P>
<P>
"I like spending time on the ocean," he says. "It seems like every day you're 
out there you see something different. Different sea life, porpoises, whales. 
Every fishing day is different." 
</P>
<P>
Floating Lab -- The Orange County Marine Institute will offer two excursions, 
both open to the public, aboard its special research-oriented floating lab this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The first will be offered from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. today, and the second will 
take place from 9 a.m. to noon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The family-oriented program is offered aboard the 85-foot research vessel Van 
Tuna. Participants, who will spend three hours at sea collecting various 
marine-life specimens, should arrive at least 15 minutes before departure. Cost 
is $20 per adult, $10 per child. For information, dial (714) 831-3850 or (714) 
496-2274. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Championships -- The prestigious Governor's Cup junior match races for 
teen-age sailors will take place Thursday through Aug. 6, at the Balboa Yacht 
Club, 1801 Bayside Drive, Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six top sailors from across the United States and as far away as New 
Zealand will compete in the racing event, which is one of a half-dozen major 
junior championships in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The sailors, divided into 12 teams of three, will race in identically rigged 
Santana 20 sailboats. Races will begin at noon each day in the ocean just off 
the Newport Pier. Three races are planned each day on Thursday, Friday and 
Saturday. The final two races are scheduled Sunday. For information, dial (714) 
673-3515. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising South -- For those who have always dreamed of sailing off into the 
sunset, Orange Coast College is offering a two-night sailing seminar on 
cruising Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean by private boat. 
</P>
<P>
The program is entitled "Cruising South" and is from 7 to 10 p.m. Wednesday and 
Aug. 9 at the Orange Coast College Sailing Center, 1801 W. Coast Highway, 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Experienced cruisers John Bowman, Don and Jill Shannon and Bill McNaughton will 
be guest speakers. Cost is $39. For information, dial (714) 432-5880. 
</P>
<P>
Kids in Boats -- A beginning boating course for children is being offered this 
summer by the Orange County Girl Scouts at the Dana Point Harbor Youth and 
Group Facility, 34451 Ensenada Place, Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Round Robin Boating," the class is open to children 10 and older and 
covers rowing, canoeing, sailing and basic boating safety. Participants must be 
able to swim. Classes will be from 1 to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. Cost is 
$35 for Girl Scouts, $40 for others. For information, dial (714) 979-7900.

FAMILY LIFE: GIRL WHO SAYS SHE'S HOMELESS ASKS IF SHE CAN LIVE WITH A NEW 
FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Family Life isn't an advice column, and I'm certainly no Dear Abby. But this 
week we have an emergency on our hands in the form of an anonymous letter we 
received. 
</P>
<P>
"To whom it may concern," the letter begins. "I am 15 years old. . . . I have a 
bad family situation and a week ago I was kicked out. I have a family who will 
take me in; I've known them all my life. . . . This family would like to be my 
foster parents, but once my family finds out that I went to (them), my father 
will flip and he will either kill me or a member of (the other) family. He is 
very violent and has no common sense, obviously. 
</P>
<P>
"What can be done in order for me to stay with this family legally? I want to 
live a normal life, go to school and be somebody, which I could never do at 
home. I only feel safe with (the other family) and I don't, and won't, go with 
anyone else. What can be done? Is it possible for them to become my foster 
parents? How long will it take? Who should we contact? 
</P>
<P>
"Please help me. There has to be something that can be done, but everywhere we 
go and everyone we talk to has all the wrong answers and solutions for me and 
my questions regarding my problem and how I want to solve it. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
"Troubled Teen" 
</P>
<P>
Dear Troubled Teen: 
</P>
<P>
"To live a normal life, go to school and be somebody. . . ." It sure doesn't 
seem like too much to ask, does it? 
</P>
<P>
You didn't tell me much about yourself or your situation. I would like to talk 
to you and find out more, but all I have are your initials and the post office 
box you gave as your return address. For your protection, I've omitted a couple 
of details here that could have made you recognizable to someone who knows you. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't sure what to tell you, so I called some people who could offer you 
expert advice. It took several phone calls, and I spent almost as much time on 
hold as I did talking to people. Unfortunately, says Agnes Trinchero, executive 
director of Florence Crittenton Services of Orange County -- one of the 
agencies available to help girls like you -- there is no centralized referral 
number for the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it can be really frustrating," Trinchero says. But her agency can't 
help you, either, until you get things squared away legally. 
</P>
<P>
The hard truth, T.T., is that you might not be able to decide on your own 
solution. So says Robert Malmberg, social services director for the Orange 
County Child Abuse Registry. Being a minor, you aren't free to make your own 
decisions about where and with whom you will live. 
</P>
<P>
Under ordinary circumstances, Malmberg says, the law requires that your parents 
must not only know where you are but consent to whatever arrangements are made 
for you. But if it's a dangerous situation -- and yours sounds like it may be 
-- then legal steps could be taken quickly to protect you from your parents. Or 
if your parents still refuse to allow you to come home, then you would be 
considered an abandoned child, and they could be stripped of their parental 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Child abandonment is a misdemeanor, punishable by six months in jail or a 
$1,000 fine, Malmberg says. "But it's also illegal for (this new family) to 
have (the girl) in their home. The law says that you may not sustain an 
unrelated minor in your home if you are not licensed as a foster parent." 
</P>
<P>
You aren't breaking the law yourself in being away from home, Malmberg says. 
But you need to protect your potential foster parents from possible criminal 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
He adds, however, that you may very well be able to continue living with this 
family as long as the necessary steps are taken. 
</P>
<P>
Malmberg wants you to call him on the Child Abuse Registry's hotline at (714) 
834-5353. You can call anytime, day or night. You may have to wait on hold for 
a while, but please be patient. He is in the office during regular business 
hours, or he can be paged. "I have a beeper with me 24 hours a day," Malmberg 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can talk to one of the social workers there. 
</P>
<P>
When you call, a social worker will arrange to come and talk to you about your 
situation. Be open and honest about what's going on, and explain why you are 
concerned about your father being violent. Is this something he has done before 
to you or someone else? "If she is, of course, in danger, we're not going to 
hesitate to find a protective environment for her," Malmberg says. 
</P>
<P>
"As with most situations with adolescents, there are two sides to every story," 
he says. "But generally, when they identify themselves to be endangered, very 
rare are the cases we've found to be fictional. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to keep families together if at all possible, but only if it's in the 
child's best interest." 
</P>
<P>
You're fortunate, Malmberg says, to have another family to turn to. Most other 
kids in this kind of situation aren't so lucky. And if it's determined that it 
would be unsafe for you to return home, you "could keep staying with this 
family, but they would have to apply immediately for a foster care license." 
</P>
<P>
They would have to be fingerprinted and investigated for any criminal record, 
and the house would have to be inspected to make sure it's safe and there is 
enough room for you. "Most homes could probably qualify," Malmberg says. 
</P>
<P>
To apply for a foster care license, the family giving you refuge should call 
Carol Whelan at (714) 532-7762. Or write to her at 1517 Braden Court, Orange, 
Calif. 92668. 
</P>
<P>
If they would like some background information on what it's like to be a foster 
parent, have them call Liz Lafferty at Advanced Resources for Foster Kids in 
Anaheim, a support organization for foster families, (714) 939-0477. Lafferty 
is also willing to talk to you anonymously, but she warns that she would be 
required by law to report the situation if she knows who or where you are. 
</P>
<P>
You don't consider yourself a runaway, but if you want to relay a message to 
your parents without revealing where you are, you can call the runaway hotline 
at 1 (800) 231-6946. 
</P>
<P>
Or if you want advice but aren't ready to put yourself in the hands of the 
authorities, call Tom Shaw at the Assessment and Treatment Services Center, 
(714) 756-0994. ATSC's motto is "Arrest the problem and not the child." The 
agency is focused on helping families and children deal with their problems 
without going through the juvenile justice system. ATSC can offer counseling 
for you and your parents, if you feel that's the way to go. 
</P>
<P>
Trinchero recommends that you report either to the Orange County Probation 
Department at (714) 834-6611 or the nearest police station. You will most 
likely be dealing with the authorities at some point, and if you make the first 
move yourself, "then they're going to hear your side of the story first, and 
that could be to your advantage," she says. 
</P>
<P>
It may or may not help you to know that there are a lot of other troubled teens 
out there. "This is a fairly typical problem," Malmberg says. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sending a copy of this column to the post office box you gave me, just in 
case you don't see it when it comes out. I promised Malmberg and the other 
experts that I would let them know if I hear from you again. 
</P>
<P>
But they couldn't make the same promise to me because your case, like all the 
others they deal with, must be kept confidential. Unless you call or write 
again, I'll never know what became of you. 
</P>
<P>
So do me a favor. When things settle down and you have a minute, let me know 
how it worked out, not just because I'll be curious, but because by then you'll 
be an expert, too, and some other troubled teen may be able to benefit from 
your experience. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.

ADVICE FOR PARENTS OF CHILDREN FLYING SOLO 
</P>

Here are tips from various airlines for children who will be flying alone. 
Parents should consult with individual airlines for specific rules or 
recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, tell the child not to leave the plane under any 
circumstances unless escorted by a flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
Try to schedule flying time in the middle of the day to avoid the disruption of 
getting up at dawn to make an early flight or flying at night. 
</P>
<P>
Arrive at the airport at least an hour before scheduled departure time. Most 
airlines require forms to be filled out, and the extra time allows for relaxed 
goodbys, which put children at ease. 
</P>
<P>
Explain that flight attendants are there to make the trip easier, and your 
child should not hesitate to ask them for help. 
</P>
<P>
Brief the child about meal service. If a special meal (hamburger, peanut butter 
and jelly, or spaghetti circles) better suits a child, many airlines will allow 
you to order one 24 hours ahead of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Send along a favorite toy (a quiet one), game or book; a few of each for longer 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
Gift wrap a toy to open en route -- a bit of intrigue to occupy short attention 
spans. 
</P>
<P>
Provide the child with enough money to make phone calls should the need arise. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to filling out the airline's paper work, include on the child's 
person a home telephone number, the city of his destination and the phone 
number of the person who is supposed to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
Send along gum or hard candy for the child to chew during the plane's descent. 
Some children experience uncomfortable eardrum pressure and chewing relieves 
it. 
</P>
<P>
If a child is arriving on a flight unaccompanied, make sure to be at the gate 
on time. "It breaks their little hearts if no one is there to meet them," said 
Patti Humberger, flight attendant for American Airlines. ROBERT OSTMANN JR.

NO PLANES? WHAT ABOUT TRAINS AND BUSES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Trains and buses are not nearly as accommodating as planes to children 
traveling alone. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak has seen the same increase in the numbers of unaccompanied children 
passengers but has much tighter rules than the airlines: 
</P>
<P>
Unaccompanied children must be 8 or over. 
</P>
<P>
Children under 12 cannot travel alone on an overnight train, nor can they 
travel on a train scheduled to arrive at its destination after 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Unaccompanied children must travel to a staffed station. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a lot more of these kids, especially those traveling between 
divorced parents," said Amtrak spokesman Arthur Lloyd. "In California, we see 
them mostly on the L.A.-to-San Diego or the San Francisco-to-Bakersfield runs 
because those meet our restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said Amtrak advises parents to prepare their children for unaccompanied 
train travel just as they would prepare them for flight. He said conductors are 
notified of children traveling alone and look out for them. 
</P>
<P>
"But the most important advice of all is to tell kids not to speak to strangers 
and that if they have any trouble to find a uniformed trainman," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Children under 12 are not allowed to ride unaccompanied on Greyhound, the major 
long-distance bus line serving Orange County. ROBERT OSTMANN JR.
