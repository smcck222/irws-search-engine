HEALTH FUNDING CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County budget for public health and mental health services for 
the year 1989-90 shows a slight overall increase over the previous year, but 
that increase conceals deteriorating services because, once again, the funds 
are keeping pace with neither costs nor case loads. This is the situation also 
in Orange County, in San Diego County, in virtually every county of the state. 
But nowhere is it as critical as in Los Angeles County, because of its 
concentration of poor people, homeless people and the acutely mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
There is a prospect of some relief when the state Legislature and Gov. George 
Deukmejian complete negotiations at the end of the summer on the distribution 
of new tobacco tax revenues and on supplements to the previously agreed-upon 
state appropriations. But those additional funds will not reverse the 
deterioration. And there is a risk that the tobacco tax money, earmarked by the 
voters in Proposition 99 last year for new programs, will be lost in rescuing 
old programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health Services has come out of the county budget 
negotiations with a total of $1.6 billion, compared to $1.57 billion last year. 
In terms of cash, it is effectively a standstill. In terms of services, it 
represents a cutback because of cost increases. The dimension of the shortfall 
is best understood when the actual budget is compared with the $2 billion 
budget proposed last year. In other words, there are clear needs for at least 
$400 million more. 
</P>
<P>
Deterioration is evident at almost every level of health service. The waiting 
time last week for access to outpatient clinics at the County-USC Medical 
Center averaged more than five weeks at 39 of the clinics, and up to six months 
at three others. Virtually every use of the county system, including deliveries 
of babies, emergency room cases, outpatient clinic visits and hospital 
admissions, hit record levels in the fiscal year just ended. And matters will 
get worse unless new state funds are found because some of the outpatient 
clinics are funded only through September. There is no funding in the current 
budget to cover uncompensated care and emergency room services at private 
hospitals, increasing the likelihood of further breakdown of the trauma 
network. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Mental Health is also in crisis, requiring $8.6 million in 
additional funds just to stand still. And standing still means doing nothing to 
address the severe problems pointed out last month in a study by Coopers &amp; 
Lybrand for the county grand jury. That report underscored a gross inequity in 
state funding, because the state does not use a formula that addresses the 
severity of the mental health case load. The county last year, for example, 
received 34.6% of the state mental health funding, even though it has 42.1% of 
the most severely ill mental aid patient admissions in the state. The county 
estimates critical unmet needs in mental health at $139 million. 
</P>
<P>
These grave problems affect every person in the state, not just the poor. The 
long-term solutions will come from a better organization of the health care 
system. But in the short term, the compromise on funding education, 
transportation, health and welfare agreed on in Sacramento, and being submitted 
next year to the voters, offers an appropriate response.

SPACE GOALS VS. EARTH GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With his speech proclaiming a lunar base and a trip to Mars as goals for 
America's space program, George Bush's vision of presidential leadership comes 
into focus (Part I, July 21). It is one of Potemkin politics, a grand facade of 
great intentions thrown up to hide a paralysis of will. Although Bush cannot 
offer us a clue about how to reduce the present deficit, and while even basic 
scientific research withers on the vine for lack of funding, and the health of 
America's poor deteriorates due to decimated public health budgets, he proposes 
that we embark on an extravagantly expensive space expedition. 
</P>
<P>
We deserve more from a President than mere rhetoric devoid of reason or 
responsibility. Great visions may be part of being a great leader, but without 
the courage to make hard choices, to face national problems head on and offer 
solutions, there is no leadership at all.

<P>
In response to The Times' editorial "Beyond the Moon" (July 21): 
</P>
<P>
I share your sentiments. I would like to add a thought or two that seem 
relevant. 
</P>
<P>
The exploration (and exploitation) of the realm beyond our wafer-thin 
atmosphere is the most stupendous challenge to Homo sapiens since we ventured 
forth from Olduvai. It will, indeed must, happen. "Because it's there." Because 
it's necessary. By way of a not-too-loose analogy, consider the existence of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The second thought, directed at the Doubting Thomases out there who decry 
"throwing money out to space": 
</P>
<P>
Any manufacturing project involves miners, foundry workers, transport 
personnel, engineers, machinists, assemblers, coordination personnel, just to 
list the merely obvious. Not so obvious are banks, restaurants, farmers, and 
half a hundred other "fringe elements." 
</P>
<P>
Throwing money away? It sounds like a healthy economy to me. At least more 
healthy than nukes that we dare not use.

BENEFICIAL FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new study of foreign investments in the United States is reassuring at a time 
when both Congress and some state legislatures are considering establishment of 
new barriers to discourage the flow of foreign money into the United States. 
The study lends support to President Bush's welcome commitment to resist the 
barriers and encourage a free flow of investments in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The President told a press conference in February that "it is important if we 
believe in open markets that people be allowed to invest here, just as I'd like 
to see more openness for American investors in other countries." 
</P>
<P>
Openness is a problem that must be pressed, for there is stark unfairness in 
dealing with nations that are major investors in the United States but maintain 
critical barriers to U.S. investments in their countries. 
</P>
<P>
However, those in a panic about foreign investments in the United States tend 
to forget that American overseas investments, measured as a percentage of gross 
domestic product in those nations, exceed the investments of those nations in 
the United States in every case except that of Japan. And, even in Japan, 
direct foreign investment increased 46% last year as some restrictions were 
relaxed. In 1987, U.S. citizens' foreign investments were 18% greater than 
foreign holdings in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The new study of the impact of foreign direct investments is the work of the 
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York and is published in the June 29 issue of 
the company's World Financial Markets newsletter. It estimates that foreign 
investments of all sorts in the United States will reach $380 billion by the 
end of the year, a quadrupling in this decade but nevertheless a relatively 
small share of the economy, equal at the moment to less than 7% of the gross 
national product. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the surge of American investments in Europe in the 1960s, which drew 
warnings from some Europeans but apparently benefited all, the new Morgan study 
concludes that the foreign investments in the United States are benefiting both 
investors and the U.S. economy. "They have no genuine drawbacks for either," 
according to the study. "New inflows add to U.S. domestic investment, bring 
improved skills and technology in their training, provide stable current 
account deficit financing, and ultimately should lead to import substitution 
and export expansion that will help correct the deficit." 
</P>
<P>
The report then adds a singularly important thought: "The inflows will outlast 
the deficit, for they are fundamentally the product of global integration." 
</P>
<P>
Those pressing for restrictions on foreign investment, or for discriminatory 
reporting requirements for foreign investors, ignore the importance of the 
foreign investments. A case in point, cited in the study, is the role of 
foreign-controlled banks. They provided in 1987 only 5.3% of banking industry 
employment in the United States but, "Nationwide, they provided nearly 
one-quarter of all commercial and industrial loans." 
</P>
<P>
There are adequate safeguards in place for protecting national security. To add 
further so-called safeguards would undermine an even more important element of 
national security, the economic viability of the nation, and the ability of 
Americans to play a vigorous and competitive role in the face of "global 
integration."

ARMENIAN AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was gratifying to read the two reports on after-earthquake activities in 
Armenia -- the comprehensive roundup by Michael Parks, "Armenia Aid Gets Back 
to the Basics," and "L.A.'s Armenia Quake Relief Stuck in Pipeline," by Esther 
Schrader (Part I, July 23). The problems and setback alluded to in both pieces 
continue to be covered at length in the Armenian-American press. I am grateful 
to see that your coverage will make them widely known and that credit is 
acknowledged to all the countries throughout the world that have rushed to 
Armenia's aid in her desperate hours of need. 
</P>
<P>
It is to be hoped that the logistic problems which seem to be inherent in any 
organizational structure are now being overcome and that the massive attempts 
for much-needed assistance are bearing fruitful results. Certainly, despite 
dissension among some of the leadership, it is obvious that the heartfelt 
dedication will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Many Armenian-Americans have made several trips since Dec. 7, 1988, among them 
Dr. Armen Goenjian, a Long Beach psychiatrist, who has led a group of mental 
health specialists. Incidentally, the tug of the Armenian heritage is so strong 
that it affects and puts into action those of Armenian background who don't 
necessarily have "some connection to someone affected by the tragedy," as 
Schrader states. It is the least we can do and want to do in the name of 
humanity.

THE LEGACY OF 5 EMINENT VICTORIANS

<TEXT>
<P>
Pre-Raphaelites in Love by Gay Daly (Ticknor &amp; Fields: $24.95; 468 pages) 
</P>
<P>
No other way but to begin this review of the lives and loves of the 
Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood -- that high-living group of artistic, English 
aesthetes who thrived under the reign of Queen Victoria -- with three 
unaesthetic, unmatching truisms: 
</P>
<P>
(1) The shelf-life of an American book right now is the same as a carton of 
boysenberry yogurt -- three months. The publication date of this book was in 
January, so if you want it, you'll probably have to order it. Is it worth the 
trouble? Yes, yes, yes. 
</P>
<P>
(2) American publishing is like a night in Las Vegas -- one big metaphysical 
roulette wheel. Thus, Brenda Maddox, who wrote the biography of Nora, James 
Joyce's wife, last year, won deserved renown and fame. Diane Johnson's "Lesser 
Lives" (about wives of famous Victorian men), established the foundation of 
Johnson's fine career. On the other hand, "Pre-Raphaelites in Love" (about 
Victorian wives of famous artists), a brilliant work, seems to have come and 
gone, virtually unnoticed. The only explanation is: There is no explanation! 
American publishing is a roulette wheel. 
</P>
<P>
(3) Compared to America, England is a very small country. Throw in the 
boundaries of the class system, and the fact that in the 19th Century there 
were only two universities worth going to, and you get the effect of a society 
about the size of a public high school in the San Fernando Valley: British 
Empire High. Beyond any interest you or your friends might have in the 
Pre-Raphaelites in particular, this book is a perfect handbook to Victorian 
times in England, and the way that people related in their very small world. 
When you got sick, you went to a nursing home set up by Florence Nightingale. 
When your rebellious daughter fell in love, it might be with George Bernard 
Shaw. If someone's little nephew drifted by, it was probably Rudyard Kipling. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convenient Oversight 
</P>
<P>
A UCLA student of mine (she went on, still not getting to the actual subject 
matter here), interrupted me just this semester as I spoke of romance: "But 
what you remember is from the Fifties," she chided. "That was when people 
didn't sleep with each other until they got married." How convenient it is for 
us to forget the sexuality of our ancestors! But as Gay Daly reminds us, 
writing about the 1850s, "we imagine that we have freed ourselves from the 
baggage of the Victorian world, and in some ways no doubt we have, but . . . 
its myths of romance and marriage are still embedded in our consciousness and 
they have great power over us -- greater, in fact, when we refuse to 
acknowledge them." 
</P>
<P>
This book is about five amazingly successful Victorian artists, those 
"Pre-Raphaelites" who gave us a series of willowy, sensual, mythic female 
beauties whose cheapened descendants we see on the covers of a thousand sci-fi 
paperbacks today. It is also about the women who modeled for those mythic 
pictures, and who ended up marrying (or pining away for) those artists. But 
what this book is really about is us. In weaving together the lives of John 
Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward 
Burne-Jones and William Morris with the women who posed for them, married them 
and died for them, the author has come up with a thorny wreath -- a mirror 
image of the crown of thorns we all wear today. 
</P>
<P>
These men were youth-obsessed; they had to be, their careers as artists 
depended upon it. They hated to get married and feared sex, but when they got a 
taste, they became sex fiends! 
</P>
<P>
The women, denied the possibility of jobs, could look forward to lives as 
spinsters, whores or wives. Prescription drugs abounded: two people in this 
book die of overdoses. Couples searched in vain for contraceptive information 
but had to settle for unwanted pregnancies. Men had nervous breakdowns rather 
than face their domestic responsibilities. Everyone was in love with somebody 
else, most of the time. And yet these artists lived long, productive lives. And 
with two exceptions, their wives survived them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sex and Elegance 
</P>
<P>
Love, sex, style, elegance, wit, adventure -- all of that is in these pages. A 
wife who is still a virgin after six years of marriage! A childbirth so 
horrendous that an 11-pound baby must be "wrestled out," and emerges with a 
black eye and a broken arm! It used to be hard, as a student of English Lit, 
not to dismiss the Pre-Raphaelites as a group of sickly guys summed up in 25 
pages of somebody's tissue-paper anthology. But never again, not after you've 
read this hypnotic, intelligent, sensational book.

JACK SMITH: SMOOTH SAILING THROUGH THE LOCAL DMV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had been anxious ever since, some weeks ago, I received a notice in the mail 
that my driver license would expire on my birthday in August and that I must 
apply at a Department of Motor Vehicles station for a new one. I must be 
prepared to take a written test. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't know whether I would have to take a driving test or not. For the last 
two four-year periods my new license had come automatically on my birthday. I 
didn't know whether I was being asked to apply in person now because of my age 
or because I had run a red light a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
I felt I knew the law well enough to pass the written test, but sometimes the 
multiple-answer questions can be ambiguous or deceptive. The last time I had 
taken the test, I had missed one question. 
</P>
<P>
I dropped in at the Auto Club in Glendale and they gave me a booklet on the law 
and some sample tests. I put them on a table by my chair and had been going 
over them off and on for the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
I felt secure that, even if I had to take the driving test, I would have no 
problems. One need only know the law and drive with reasonable caution. On the 
other hand, the price of failure was unthinkable. Not to have a driver license 
in Los Angeles is like being under house arrest. I could make a dumb mistake 
and blow it. 
</P>
<P>
The application form said I could call a DMV office and make an appointment. 
When I thought I was ready I called the Glendale office and made an appointment 
for 10 a.m. Monday. My wife decided to go with me. We had breakfast at Billy's 
deli in Glendale and then drove to the DMV station on Glenoaks. We were 20 
minutes early. 
</P>
<P>
What I had dreaded most was not the test itself, but the bureaucratic 
processing. In earlier years, I remembered, there were dreary lines, weary 
clerks, and a feeling of being caught in a web. 
</P>
<P>
I want to say right here for the Department of Motor Vehicles that they run as 
efficient an operation for a public agency as I have ever seen. The man who had 
made my appointment told me to go to the yellow desk. I was reminded of the 
yellow road in "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
I did indeed see a yellow desk. There were half a dozen people ahead of me, 
standing on a line. Though I was 20 minutes early, I decided to go ahead. The 
line vanished quickly. I gave my name. A young woman looked down a list and 
found it. 
</P>
<P>
She asked for my driver license, typed something on a piece of paper and told 
me to stand on the red line. There was only one person ahead of me on the red 
line. When my turn came a young woman extracted $10 from me, asked me to take 
off my glasses and read a chart. The letters looked like nests of insects. "I 
can't read it," I said. 
</P>
<P>
She moved me down to an optical machine. I looked through it without my glasses 
and got about halfway through the test. Then I did it with glasses. "Good," she 
said. She said I would have to wear glasses while driving. I always had. She 
aimed me toward a desk called Test Correction and a man gave me a test sheet 
with 18 questions and motioned me to the test area. 
</P>
<P>
I had no trouble with the questions except one. It read as follows: "You may 
not drive faster than 55 m.p.h. (1) At any time. (2) Except to keep up with the 
flow of traffic. (3) Except on designated freeways" (the correct answer). 
</P>
<P>
I knew that on some freeways in the boondocks the speed limit was posted at 65 
m.p.h. But "designated freeways" did not say that. To me, it merely meant a 
highway designated as a freeway. It should have read on freeways posted 65 
m.p.h. I sensed a trick. I checked answer No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
I took the test back to the Test Correction desk. The man checked my answer to 
that question and wrote -1 on my test. 
</P>
<P>
"The correct answer is ambiguous," I told him, unhappy at not having been 
perfect. "Everybody goes 65 anyway," he said with a confidential laugh.

He directed me to the photo line. Only two people were in it ahead of me. I had 
my picture taken, the young woman gave me my receipt and my temporary license. 
She said my permanent license would come in the mail. The entire process had 
taken less than 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The young women who waited on me were unfailingly patient, polite and cheerful.

FINAL PROGRAM IN KALEIDOSCOPE SERIES 
</P>

Instead of once again succumbing to excess, Dance Kaleidoscope unexpectedly 
satirized it during much of the showcase series' final 1989 program Saturday in 
the Cal State Los Angeles Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Gregg Bielemeier's wry new solo, "A Place for Everything and 
Everything in its Place . . ," with its mock-serious anthology of the most 
flagrant mannerisms and cliches found in ballet, pop dance and the avant-garde. 
Emerging from the parody of choreographic styles came a bitter question very 
specifically expressed in sound and motion: Is the contemporary dancer merely a 
dog executing tricks? 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Planeix and Thomas Crocker (a.k.a. Blue Palm) seemed to answer 
affirmatively through their suite from "Dance Talks," in which the demeaning, 
lifelong duplicities inflicted on dancers were boldly articulated in speech and 
illustrated with movement. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Shrimps' inspired outdoor intermission epic "Bluff" reduced the 
preoccupation with sex-war in contemporary modern dance to a series of assaults 
by teams of morons in their underwear. Sometimes they even wielded giant, 
shockingly phallic legumes -- but don't tell Sen. Jesse Helms. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Shrimps, Blue Palm and Bielemeier didn't get around to 
satirizing some of Kaleidoscope's own programming sins. Where were they during 
Ka-Ron Brown Lehman's solo "A Piece of Sky," for instance? 
</P>
<P>
This slick, sure-fire collage of Alvin Ailey hallmarks featured the customary 
lady in a long white dress (here the valiant Jessica Vallot) doing the usual, 
frenzied circle-kicks -- accompanied, as always, by a blaring pop ballad. 
Perhaps Lehman should formally acknowledge her source by re-titling the work "A 
Piece of 'Cry.' " 
</P>
<P>
More original, though ultimately no more satisfying, Patricia Sandback's solo 
"Toward Stillness" (well danced by Debi Toth) used walking passages to 
punctuate sequences of rhythmic keening and other vividly projected gestural 
imagery. However, the components remained isolated statements and the solo 
itself a curiously incomplete experience. 
</P>
<P>
Equally fragmentary was Tina Gerstler's "Eclipse," a brief, fluid structuralist 
quartet, neatly performed, with some tentative expressive content occasionally 
evident. Gerstler aimed for a cosmic perspective on human relationships, but by 
using intense embraces merely as formal motifs -- and never suggesting anything 
about the participants -- her work looked at once overblown and trivial. 
</P>
<P>
If Dance Kaleidoscope gave a prize for reckless ambition, it ought to go to 
Antony Balcena for "Dudes." This movement-theater extravaganza not only dared 
to repudiate every vestige of gay pride in its uncompromisingly downbeat 
portrayal of homosexual relationships, it also emphasized the most horrific 
elements of the AIDS crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Balcena proved highly imaginative in physicalizing thorny socio-sexual issues, 
but his grotesque finale needs to be revised -- if only because it closely 
duplicates the ending of Gerald Arpino's apocalyptic ballet, "The Clowns." 
</P>
<P>
Completing the program: "Departure of the Youngsters," John Malashock's deeply 
personal exploration of power and manipulation, recently reviewed in these 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
A former Tharp dancer, Malashock is one of the major talents to arise in 
Southern California since Dance Kaleidoscope folded two years ago. His presence 
on the final program offered potent evidence that this newly revived series 
must continue as a means of introducing (and developing) new artists for a 
wider audience.

ABC News President Roone Arledge denied that the network intentionally faked a 
photograph in the Felix Bloch spy story and lashed out at former television 
news executives who have criticized ABC. Arledge said the incident was the 
result of a "production error," not a deliberate attempt to mislead viewers in 
the story about a career diplomat suspected of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
The network has been widely criticized for the "World News Tonight" broadcast 
July 21 that used actors to simulate the handing over of a briefcase by a 
diplomat to a Soviet KGB agent. The ABC News chief said that the production 
error occurred because the producers of the show wanted to use an artist's 
sketch of the handing over of a briefcase but that no artist was available at 
the time. Instead the producer of ABC's "World News Tonight" took a Polaroid 
shot of the simulated briefcase exchange, intending to use what Arledge called 
a "paint-box" technique to turn the photograph into a sketch. Unknown to the 
people in the control room, the photograph was shown on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Defending his network, Arledge said, "There's a difference between an error or 
a lapse of taste or whatever and a news organization like ABC having a policy 
of faking things." Arledge said the error provided "a field day, particularly 
for deposed ex-network news presidents who, generally speaking, have nothing to 
do and so they leap into print at the first opportunity without ever checking 
anything." He named Fred Friendly and Richard Salant, former heads of CBS News, 
and Larry Grossman, former NBC News chief, and said "ABC News does not need 
lectures from people like that." Claudia Puig

Actor Billy Dee Williams defended his association with Colt 45 malt liquor, 
saying criticism of liquor advertisements that target blacks is overblown. "I 
think people are getting a little ridiculous," Williams said in Detroit after 
making a donation to the Special Olympics. "When we don't know what to do we 
start picking at anything. The whole focus should be not so much on the beer 
but on how you lead your life," said Williams, a spokesman for Colt for several 
years. Black leaders in Detroit, citing studies showing more alcohol- and 
tobacco-related health problems among blacks than among whites, have been 
sharply critical of advertisements for those products in the city. "I think a 
lot of people are overreacting," Williams said. "You can't legislate morality."

Actress Linda Hunt will make her Los Angeles stage debut in Emily Mann's 
one-woman drama, "Annulla," opening Oct. 21 at the Court Theatre in West 
Hollywood. Hunt, who won an Academy Award in 1983 for her performance in "The 
Year of Living Dangerously," will play the title role of a Holocaust survivor; 
playwright Mann (whose credits include "Execution of Justice," on the 1979 Dan 
White murder trial) will direct. Claudia Puig

Two weeks after Herbert von Karajan's death, the Salzburg Festival bade 
farewell Sunday to its greatest maestro and mentor in a commemorative hour of 
music, with no speeches. "His language was music," said a footnote of the 
program to explain the lack of official tributes. Karajan, who dominated the 
Salzburg musical scene for nearly four decades, died of heart failure July 16. 
He was 81. The ceremony at Great Festival Hall was broadcast on Austrian 
television and transmitted to several other countries. The Vienna Philharmonic 
Orchestra, under the baton of Seiji Ozawa, George Solti and James Levine, 
played selections by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and Mozart. The ceremony was 
attended by Karajan's widow, Eliette, President Kurt Waldheim, Chancellor Franz 
Vranitzky and hundreds of other guests. A church ceremony was held in Salzburg 
Cathedral on July 23. Claudia Puig

JOYCE WEXLER-BALLARD AT SANTA MONICA BEACH

Contemporary Angst is the stuff of which much performance art is made -- urban 
ritual, the battle of the sexes, prejudice and alienation. Performed at Santa 
Monica Beach on Saturday, Joyce Wexler-Ballard's site-specific "Line Down the 
Middle: An L.A. Travelogue" was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
While there were eloquent moments of spoken verse and minimalist stage 
pictures, "Line Down the Middle" did not cohere. 
</P>
<P>
Wexler-Ballard failed to command the big picture: Gestures, choreography and 
multiple focuses worked against one another, and the dozen performers seemed 
each to be off in their own worlds, giving the work an unduly amateurish feel. 
</P>
<P>
Three hibachi grills rested in the sand stage area between the two sculpted 
concrete "performance platforms" adjacent to the promenade, near Ocean Park 
Boulevard. Between the grills and the platforms, a woman sat in a beach chair 
with a purple umbrella, a platter of oranges and a microphone near at hand, 
looking like a refugee from a Robert Wilson tableau. Unfortunately, what 
followed was not as pithy, but was equally mired in dated eclecticism. 
</P>
<P>
Women and men graced the platforms, striking melodramatic gestural poses to a 
sound track of oblique narratives of personal woe and social injustice. A drill 
team of women in sun togs carrying beach mats executed simple rituals in the 
space between the platforms, while three men clothed in white and holding 
oversized toothbrushes stood in the distance -- so far away, in fact, that it 
wasn't immediately clear whether they were intended to be taken as part of the 
spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
An errant barbecue chef wearing a red-checkered apron and wielding tongs, 
desperately seeking someone whose name he couldn't remember, appeared in the 
midst of all this, providing comic relief from otherwise obtuse action. Other 
welcomed (if random and unplanned) distractions emanated from the nearby food 
stand: "Number 6, your hamburger is ready." 
</P>
<P>
The event, the third in the Santa Monica Arts Festival series, was co-produced 
by the Santa Monica Arts Commission and the Cactus Foundation.JAN BRESLAUER

ORGAN TRANSCRIPTIONS OFFER MIXED RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the movement for authentic performance practice may still be in full 
swing, Jared Jacobsen longs for the days when transcriptions were the 
organist's stock in trade. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, Jacobsen offered an 
entire program of transcriptions on the 265-rank Hazel Wright organ. The 
results were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Transcriptions generate a unique set of problems. If you take a score written 
for the clarity of the piano, like Prokofiev's Toccata, Opus 11, and alter it 
for the dramatic reverberations of a pipe organ (as in the Jean Guillou 
transcription heard here), have you violated the composer's original intention? 
And if so, have you spoiled the integrity of the music or created a new work? 
</P>
<P>
Idiomatic or not, it is difficult to listen to an arrangement of a well-known 
composition without imagining it in its original form. Admittedly, the 
Prokofiev-Guillou toccata is an effective, hair-raising piece and Jacobsen has 
the virtuosity it requires. Still, its wildness balances just this side of a 
fiery blur and it is impossible to avoid comparing it to the crackling 
brilliance of the original. 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of Jacobsen's program, his own transcription of "Pictures at an 
Exhibition," engendered its own set of problems. 
</P>
<P>
Caught between Mussorgsky's virtuosic piano original and Ravel's oft-programmed 
arrangement, Jacobsen accomplished neither the brilliance of the former nor the 
colors of the latter -- and sometimes the results were downright ponderous. 
</P>
<P>
There were interesting effects, however, such as antiphonal choirs for the 
promenade that leads to "The Market Place at Limoges" and again for 
"Baba-Yaga." But the most successful use of organ was in the "Catacombs" and 
"The Great Gate of Kiev." Here, implied ties to Russian Orthodoxy clearly lend 
themselves to this devotional instrument. 
</P>
<P>
The power of the Crystal Cathedral's pipe organ beckons enticingly. Jacobsen 
wielded that power for some deafening jolts, opening with a Guillou-Jacobsen 
version of Liszt's "Fantasia and Fugue on B-A-C-H" and closing with a blustery 
toccata on "Thou Art the Rock," by Henri Mulat. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the most satisfying sections were the calmest ones. The single flute 
stop for the adagio of J.S. Bach's transcription of Vivaldi's Violin Concerto 
in A minor cloaked the sanctuary in introspection; the opening of the berceuse 
from Maurice Besly's transcription of "Firebird" eerily re-created Stravinsky's 
ominous aura.

YELTSIN, 4 OTHERS TO HEAD SOVIET OPPOSITION BLOC

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet lawmakers intent on accelerating the pace of reform elected Kremlin 
maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov and three 
other prominent activists Sunday to collectively head the first formal 
opposition group within this country's national political system in nearly 70 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Voting at the conclusion of their two-day founding conference, members of the 
self-styled Inter-Regional Deputies' Group also chose a 25-member coordinating 
committee and agreed in principle on a far-reaching platform that would give 
workers the right to buy their factories, end the state's monopoly on 
television broadcasting and provide direct election of the country's president 
by popular ballot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Coming of Age 
</P>
<P>
"What we have seen here is a demonstration of how the democratic consciousness 
of our people has come of age," former Moscow Communist Party chief Yeltsin 
told a news conference Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Formation of the rebel parliamentary group is "a very serious change in the 
political-social life of our country," added Yeltsin, who was ousted from both 
the Moscow job and the ruling Politburo almost two years ago after criticizing 
what he called the slow pace of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika 
reform program. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel lawmakers stressed repeatedly that they intend to work within the 
Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet, the standing Parliament, 
as a loyal but critical counterbalance to the ruling Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The group's members insisted that they are not forming an opposition political 
group in the Western sense, but a draft copy of their program circulated at the 
weekend convention calls for repeal of Article 6 of the Soviet constitution, 
which establishes the "leading role" of the Communist Party in all phases of 
national life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ultimate Power 
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, which won preliminary approval Sunday, the group sees 
the Congress of People's Deputies as the ultimate source of state power. 
</P>
<P>
By simply convening their meeting, members of the new group broke a tradition 
of nearly seven decades of organizational unity behind the policies of the top 
party leadership. Political "factionalism," as virtually any group criticism of 
official policy is termed, has not been tolerated within the Soviet Communist 
Party since its 10th Congress in March, 1921, and the last rival party here, 
the Socialist Revolutionaries, was suppressed in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 of the Congress of People's Deputies' 2,250 members were on hand 
for the weekend conference, and supporters said as many as 250 others who back 
their efforts were unable to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Even with more than 500 supporters in the Congress, the faction would fall well 
short of a majority needed to push through its ideas. However, the group could 
prove to be a magnet to attract swing deputies toward more aggressive change. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Yeltsin and Sakharov, the new group selected as co-chairmen 
reformist historian Yuri N. Afanasyev, prominent economist Gavriil Popov and 
Estonian academician Viktor Palm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collective Responsibility 
</P>
<P>
While the five theoretically share collective responsibility as co-chairmen, 
radical populist Yeltsin attracted the most votes among the 13 candidates for 
the senior leadership, and he has been the group's primary spokesman. 
Afanasyev, who is director of the Moscow Historical Archive Institute and a 
leading force behind efforts to fill in the so-called "blank spots" of the 
Soviet Union's Stalinist past, finished second in Sunday's balloting. 
</P>
<P>
All the co-chairmen except Sakharov appeared later at a news conference, during 
which they indicated that their top priority will be to reform the election law 
and bring forward elections for local and regional officials now scheduled for 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
They called for an extraordinary session of the Congress of People's Deputies 
in September to consider constitutional amendments related to elections. The 
next regular session of the Congress is not due until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Half-Hearted Reforms 
</P>
<P>
The rebel deputies hold that Gorbachev's reforms have so far been half-hearted 
and have therefore failed to lead the nation out of what they see as a 
deepening political and economic crisis. Widespread strikes by the country's 
coal miners in mid-July proved the growing level of social tension, they 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
Other reforms advocated in the Inter-Regional Deputies' Group's draft platform 
would mandate: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Public referendums on any proposed laws affecting the rights and freedoms 
of citizens and on any proposed constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An annual government report on its activities followed by a parliamentary 
vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A two-term maximum for the chairman of people's councils at all levels of 
government, including the Supreme Soviet now headed by Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Preliminary work to end the system of internal Soviet passports and allow 
free entry and exit to the country's citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And legalization of independent trade unions.

THE MONEY BEHIND THE L.A. SLUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE BECKLUND, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a decade, many of Los Angeles' worst old slum apartment buildings 
have been commodities on an insider's trading block. 
</P>
<P>
While immigrant tenants live in squalor in the aging structures, 
behind-the-scenes investors have developed sophisticated financial devices that 
drain the buildings of thousands of dollars in cash rents and virtually condemn 
them to further decay. 
</P>
<P>
Those who stand to make the greatest profits do not need to step inside the 
door. Often, they do not own the properties, at least not in their own names. 
They own the mortgages on them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exceed Property Value 
</P>
<P>
In a two-month examination of Los Angeles slum real estate, The Times found 
that some lenders have heaped old buildings with high-interest mortgages that 
often exceed the value of the properties. That leaves the titular owners to run 
the buildings on little cash, face creditors, and assume the liability for slum 
code violations. 
</P>
<P>
Slum traders often "sell" buildings to their own dummy corporations, giving 
themselves new "loans" each time and inflating the apparent value of the 
buildings. They then sell the buildings to paid front men, or to 
unsophisticated buyers who often do not realize their lenders are related to 
each other. Because each transaction taken alone appears to be standard, 
government agencies are unlikely to spot abuses. 
</P>
<P>
And, there are abuses: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The titular president of two slum trading corporations, Grover Black, 
apparently is a dog once owned by Westside real estate agent William Leyton, 
according to associates. Public records show that Grover Black has had two 
offices, hired at least two attorneys, signed court records, and claimed an 
interest in at least two major slum buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Leyton declined an interview. His attorney, Milton Simon, who filed a federal 
bankruptcy petition signed by Grover Black, said he "preferred not to comment" 
on the identity of Grover Black. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One of Los Angeles' busiest and most flamboyant slumlords in recent years 
was a one-time Boston bank robber named Joe Fitzpatrick who financed his empire 
of several dozen apartment buildings through numerous loans from friendly 
bankers to what he himself described as "straws" and "shell" companies. One was 
named MLUS Inc., an anagram of SLUM. A close associate of Leyton, he has been 
accused in court of naming his dog president of one of his companies. 
Fitzpatrick claimed that the company president, "Teluce Black," actually was 
his gardener. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick, who acknowledged in a court case last year that he had been 
convicted of bank robbery about 20 years ago, left town last year after 
declaring bankruptcy. But he managed to get back at least one of his old 
apartment buildings by lying to the court about his relationship with his real 
estate agent, Leyton, records show. He could not be reached for comment in Las 
Vegas, where he has recently incorporated new companies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inglewood lender Alexander Spitzer has financed many of the city's most 
infamous slumlords for more than a decade, buying and selling slum trust deeds 
among his own companies. While his companies have taken in profits from 
high-interest loan payments, his staff has treated some of his borrowers -- the 
slum owners of record -- as "managers," charges one borrower who is currently 
suing him for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the frequent property transfers, an attorney for Spitzer said they 
were "for business purposes." Through the attorney, Spitzer declined an 
interview. Several of Spitzer's business entities have recently begun 
defaulting on more than $90 million in bank loans and halted payments to 
investors. One has petitioned to reorganize under Chapter 11 of federal 
bankruptcy procedures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Civil Suit 
</P>
<P>
Leyton, Fitzpatrick and Spitzer are among 142 defendants in a massive civil 
lawsuit filed last March by the city attorney, the Legal Aid Foundation and 
Litt &amp; Stormer, a private law firm that is representing thousands of 
tenants. On July 12, the city settled its claims with 11 companies and 
individuals related to Spitzer with an unprecedented agreement that requires 
them to alter their lending practices and force their borrowers to make repairs 
on substandard buildings. They are still being sued by the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges fraud, conspiracy and racketeering by the defendants in 
connection with their ownership roles in 11 selected slum buildings over the 
last decade. It argues that lenders, through imprudent or insider loans, have 
so much control over Los Angeles slum properties that they are de facto owners 
and should therefore be held accountable for living conditions in the 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"At first we saw a conspiracy among record owners," said City Atty. James K. 
Hahn. "Then there was a whole other level underneath it that we were completely 
unaware of, and that was the lenders. . . . The lenders were essentially using 
these people as fronts . . . uncredit-worthy people who could come in the back 
door and get exorbitant loans you and I could never get." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unanswered Questions 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of questions surrounding the alleged schemes that Hahn and 
the other plaintiffs hope will be answered in court: How many of the defendants 
know each other? To what extent do slum lenders violate existing law, if at 
all? Why is it that some buildings seem to travel a slum circuit, passing from 
one trader to the next and falling deeper into disrepair with each new sale? 
</P>
<P>
A review of hundreds of real estate records, as well as other public documents 
and interviews, indicates numerous links between certain slum traders. Many use 
the same attorneys, the same notary publics and, in some cases, the same 
offices. This story focuses on one "owner" and his financiers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rooks is a small film company owner who got into the slum trade as many 
owners do, hoping to profit from an investment that required little money down. 
In 1986, he bought a 47-unit slum apartment building at 3972 W. 9th St. from a 
man who had defaulted on his loans and was headed into foreclosure. He said he 
got the property with no cash down in exchange for agreeing to assume the 
existing loans. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd buy this property and fix it up," Rooks said in an interview. "I 
didn't know what I was getting into." 
</P>
<P>
Like many owners of slum properties who think they are getting a good deal, he 
did not order a title check. That, he now acknowledges, was a "big mistake." 
The $1-million loan he had agreed to pay turned out to be a "wraparound" trust 
deed, which contained payments to several other note-holders whose identities 
were not disclosed to him at the time, he said. Over the next year, he said, 
new notes on the property kept surfacing until there were "about 11." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Note Is Sold 
</P>
<P>
At first, he made his mortgage payments to William Leyton, who controlled a 
real estate investment company called Zimo 5 Inc., at an office just south of 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he said, Leyton told him he had sold the notes to his longtime business 
associate, Alexander Spitzer, who owned several industrial loan companies at 
160 S. La Brea. Over time, Rooks said, he developed a relationship with Spitzer 
and his staff that was so close he spoke with Spitzer's staff daily and 
consulted them on major repairs he was making. 
</P>
<P>
"Spitzer told me he liked me because I was 'workable' and I could deal with 
Hispanics," Rooks said. "(He told me) how blacks weren't good to have (as 
tenants) because they knew their rights more than Hispanics who don't have 
their green cards, and pay on time." 
</P>
<P>
Black women "with lots of kids in their apartments (who) had welfare checks . . 
. and no husbands so they couldn't just move out" were also acceptable tenants, 
he said he was told. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debts Increase 
</P>
<P>
To help repair the apartment building, he took out two new loans and put up his 
$300,000 Monterey Park home as collateral. Spitzer told him that other 
buildings would become available from time to time if he wanted to take them 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his debts increased and he couldn't keep up with all the repairs on 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a pipe under the building with about 20 patches on it," he said. "It 
would have been cheaper in the long run to put in a new pipe." But, he said, he 
couldn't get enough cash to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked to lower the (mortgage payment) to fix the building and put it back 
into shape. But they wouldn't do it," Rooks said. 
</P>
<P>
The city began prosecuting Rooks for slum violations. He installed new fire 
sprinklers required by the city, he claimed. Then, he said, one of Spitzer's 
business entities foreclosed and took back the building, claiming he was in 
default. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suit Alleges fraud 
</P>
<P>
Rooks is now in court, suing several companies owned by Spitzer and Leyton for 
fraud in what he claims was an illegal foreclosure. In court records, Spitzer's 
attorneys argue that the case is a straightforward example of a lender 
foreclosing on a borrower who didn't pay his debt. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally I figured it all out. . . . I was an employee rather than an owner," 
Rooks said in an interview. "They run the loans up to the market value of the 
property. You collect the money and give it all to them. You take all the 
punishment. Mr. Spitzer didn't take the (slum) violations, I took 29 counts -- 
and then after you fix it up, they take it back." 
</P>
<P>
In all, Rooks said, he paid $10,000 in fines for his slum-related violations, 
lost his building and nearly lost the home he put up for collateral. His old 
building is now owned by another major slum investor who has taken over many of 
the buildings financed by Spitzer's A &amp; B Loan Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wonderful Dog' 
</P>
<P>
The president of one of the companies holding a $1-million note on Rooks' 
property was one Grover Black. Several sources, including Michael Medved, a 
television talk show co-host, said Grover Black was Leyton's dog. 
</P>
<P>
"Grover was a really wonderful dog," Medved said in an interview. "A black 
dog." 
</P>
<P>
Grover Black's corporate address was a rental post office box on Wilshire 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, there is no Grover 
Black licensed to drive in the Los Angeles area. And there is no registered 
voter named Grover Black in the area. Asked how to reach Grover Black, Leyton's 
attorney, Milton Simon, said: "That's a very good question. I don't know." 
Asked to describe him, he answered, "I'd prefer not to." Asked point blank if 
Grover is a dog, he answered: "I never met a dog. I don't think I can talk 
about this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complicated History 
</P>
<P>
Grover Black is still listed as president of Zimo 5 Inc., an active California 
corporation. Zimo 5 transferred one trust deed on the Rooks apartment building 
three times in less than one minute, according to attorney Abrams, who said the 
real estate history of Rooks' property was the most complicated he had ever 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they tossed this note (loan) around . . . is amazing," Abrams said. 
"You never knew from day to day who owned it. . . . They set up companies on 
the left hand so they could turn money over to the right hand." 
</P>
<P>
Such transfers are known in the slum trade as "churning." 
</P>
<P>
"There are maybe 300 or 500 unreinforced brick buildings (in Los Angeles) that 
are constantly churning," said Louis Scalise, a major investor in such 
properties until the mid-1980s, when he said he left the business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clouded Titles 
</P>
<P>
Churning is not real estate as most people know it. Properties get traded 
often, sometimes every few months. Occasionally, in a series of preplanned 
maneuvers, properties change hands several times within a minute. The 
mortgages, too, are sold often, and sometimes used as collateral on other 
buildings. Run-down old hotels that would appear to be worth next to nothing 
wind up with six, eight, or 10 mortgages. One slum hotel was weighed down with 
14 trust deeds. 
</P>
<P>
Title to the buildings becomes so clouded that only the most gullible -- or the 
most savvy -- of investors will touch them. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the owners of record, including "straws" who are paid or duped into 
taking title, are slapped with code violations, utility bills and taxes. The 
noteholder avoids the responsibility and takes in the cash, foreclosing 
whenever he wants a new "owner." 
</P>
<P>
A foreclosure sale wipes the slate clean of all debt, and the cycle can start 
all over again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Likened to Insider Trading 
</P>
<P>
"Churning is the real estate equivalent of insider trading, a method of 
creating tax-free dollars," asserted Bill Wakeland, a former slum task force 
member who witnessed it first-hand after he went to work as a consultant fixing 
up old buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"They buy distressed property and begin to manipulate its value by selling it 
back and forth to each other. After a while, nobody makes payments. It gets 
ready to go to foreclosure. Then the lender takes it back and resells it to the 
same people under a different name." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, when the city attorney's office formed its "slum task force" to 
work with fire, health, and building inspectors, officials have seen frequent 
transfers of slum buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially when we saw properties changing hands, we thought they were 
transfers in avoidance of prosecution (for code violations)," said Deputy City 
Atty. Stephanie Sautner, current head of the task force. "Later we realized the 
transactions were a means of making a few people a lot of money, that they were 
designed to inflate the property and take out all possible equity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cash Attraction 
</P>
<P>
For both the record owner and his financier, the main attraction is cash -- up 
to $50,000 a month from old buildings that are crammed with immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
There are probably as many different variations on churning as there are 
investors. Most are extremely complicated. 
</P>
<P>
By selling a building often, its value rises artificially, giving investors a 
larger tax base to use for depreciating the property and writing off their 
large profits. 
</P>
<P>
Scalise said some rents are collected in cash, permitting a further tax dodge. 
</P>
<P>
"You can also say to the IRS that you're taking in $5,000 (a month) and you're 
really taking in $20,000, so on paper you have a net loss," Scalise said. "I 
never did it. And I really took a lot of money home from these buildings anyway 
-- every month." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pecking Order 
</P>
<P>
When the person in control of the building decides it is time for 
profit-taking, the record owner is usually so delinquent on his many loans that 
the financier can foreclose at will. His companies may hold the first note, the 
third and the seventh. If he uses the third note to foreclose, the people who 
own the fourth, fifth and sixth notes lose their money. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the buildings fall further and further into decay. The aging, 
47-unit building owned by Rooks is an example. 
</P>
<P>
A Leyton-related company submitted into the court record a balance sheet for 
one month that it had owned Rooks' building. According to that sheet, the 
company took in $13,524 in rents, paid virtually no maintenance costs, and 
still listed a net loss. 
</P>
<P>
According to the sheet, $136 was spent for elevator work, $80 for pest control 
and zero for "maintenance." More than $9,300 was spent on mortgage payments. 
About $2,200 went for overhead fees: "management," "legal," "sales" and "wages 
and commissions." With utility costs, the result was a net loss of $949. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Writing Off Losses 
</P>
<P>
Innocent investors write their losses off on their income taxes. And, because 
the slum trader may have defaulted on a note held by one of his own companies, 
he is probably in a position to write his "loss" off as well. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing illegal about creating one new company after another. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with creating 100 new companies or 1,000 new companies," 
said Jim Reber, spokesman for the state Franchise Tax Board. "That's perfectly 
legal. But if you don't file tax forms, they will be suspended." 
</P>
<P>
Many of Leyton's companies are suspended for failing to file state income tax 
returns, the public record shows. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous Leyton-related corporations have filed for bankruptcy. In an apparent 
violation of bankruptcy regulations, records show, Leyton failed to disclose to 
the court on more than one occasion that he held a major interest in several 
companies that previously filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flash in the Pan 
</P>
<P>
One such corporation, PHC Finance Inc., was extremely short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
According to state records, PHC Finance was incorporated on Jan. 24, 1985. 
According to federal bankruptcy records, however, it "duly held and convened" a 
meeting of its board of directors on Jan. 23, 1985 -- the day before it came 
into existence. On that day, it decided to declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
That means it went bankrupt before it was created. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 25, it filed for bankruptcy, listing about $250,000 in debts on an 
apartment building. Its president, the busy Grover Black, listed as his 
"principal place of business" 1800 S. Robertson Blvd., Suite 384. 
</P>
<P>
The "suite" is a rented post office box in a convenience store.

FOR THE RECORD

<P>
Alexander Spitzer -- The Times reported incorrectly Monday that Inglewood 
lender Alexander Spitzer controls several industrial loan companies. The 
appropriate term for Spitzer's firms is not industrial loan companies, but 
finance companies. Finance companies, or "hard-money lenders," are less 
regulated than thrift and loans, which take deposits from the public in the 
form of investment certificates. Both are licensed by the state.

NEWBORN DRUG EXPOSURE CONVICTION A 'DRASTIC' FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SANFORD, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As newborn Jessica Nicole Johnson gulped her first breath, she also took a hit 
of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
So ruled a Florida judge who earlier this month found that Jessica's mother, a 
23-year-old cocaine addict, passed the drug to her infant through the most 
intimate of channels -- the umbilical cord. 
</P>
<P>
The first U.S. criminal conviction of a mother who has given birth to a 
drug-exposed baby threads a legal needle, focusing on the 60 seconds 
immediately after birth when infants are physically separate from their mother 
but still attached by the umbilical lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
Judge O. H. Eaton's ruling that Jennifer Johnson was guilty of delivering 
cocaine to Jessica has been hailed in some quarters as a new and legitimate 
tool to protect the unborn and attacked in others as an unconstitutional 
affront that makes pregnancy a crime for drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree, however, that with an estimated 375,000 infants tainted by 
potentially fatal narcotics in the womb each year, the trend toward such 
prosecutions will increase. 
</P>
<P>
"Arresting a mother for delivering cocaine to her unborn child may be 
considered drastic and extreme," Florida Gov. Bob Martinez said in a July 20 
speech, "but it is only a matter of time before every state in the nation feels 
the need to take drastic steps such as those we've taken." 
</P>
<P>
The landmark conviction came less than two weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court 
upheld a Missouri law that restricts abortions and amid Martinez's Florida 
campaign to make the procedure illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"The hysteria associated with the abortion question permeated this case," said 
Johnson's attorney James Sweeting, who argued that it is medically impossible 
to determine whether the drugs were passed to the infants after birth or 
before, when as fetuses they had no legal rights. "The politicians and 
prosecutors here are trying to out-conservative each other." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Paltrow, staff counsel of the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project, called 
the decision an "absurd" attempt to turn the fetus into a person under the law. 
The ACLU plans to assist Sweeting in an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only will the conviction drive the women who need prenatal care the most 
away from treatment, but it is wrong because it takes a set of laws intended to 
be used in one set of circumstances, the prosecution of drug dealers, and 
applies them to another set," Paltrow said. 
</P>
<P>
But the trial judge, who invited an appellate court review of his ruling, 
contends the ACLU has missed the point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Offers View 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution here has been an effort to establish that pregnant women have 
a responsibility to their unborn children," Eaton said in an interview. "I 
think that's true. I cannot imagine why the ACLU feels sympathetic for mothers 
who transfer cocaine to their babies." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Johnson was arrested, in part, because she sought treatment before 
Jessica's healthy birth on Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who is now in a residential drug rehabilitation center that she 
entered in May as a condition of her release from jail before trial, was denied 
admission to an out-patient drug program last fall. Officials feared potential 
liability if her fetus did not survive the stress of withdrawal, according to 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Johnson summoned paramedics twice last December and told emergency 
room doctors that she was a crack cocaine addict who feared for her fetus. Each 
time, according to testimony, she was sent home. 
</P>
<P>
"What Jennifer did wrong was try to get help," Sweeting said. "She created a 
paper trail that the prosecution used against her. She made a lot of statements 
about her addiction that came back to haunt us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspected Child Abuse 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's case, reported to police by social service officials when Jessica 
tested positive for drugs after birth, arrived on the desk of Seminole County 
Assistant State's Atty. Jeff Deen as a suspected child abuse report last March. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Deen said he had been researching state laws since November for 
an avenue to prosecute a growing number of drug-addicted mothers. He decided 
that he could fashion charges from a law barring "delivery" of controlled 
substances to a minor by arguing that narcotics could be "delivered" from 
mother to child through the umbilical cord. 
</P>
<P>
Deen said he acted in alarm over a growing number of cocaine-exposed babies in 
the largely rural county just north of metropolitan Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
State officials estimate that 10,000 drug-exposed babies will be born 
throughout Florida this year, quadruple last year's 2,512 reports. In the 
social service region that includes Orlando and Seminole County, 57 drug babies 
were reported in the first three months of 1989, compared to 97 in all of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We were seeing more and more of these cases. The question was, were we going 
to do something or not? We were looking for a good test." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Leaps Forward 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's case leaped forward from among a handful under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"She had two cocaine babies already," the prosecutor said. "We had to say to 
ourselves, 'Are we going to let Jennifer go on?' It was pretty clear she was 
either going to die or have another cocaine baby." 
</P>
<P>
By charging Johnson and winning a conviction, Deen said: "We cracked a barrier. 
Right now this is novel, but we want this to be a routine tool. Do I envision 
(a case) where a woman would go to jail? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has not yet been sentenced on the felony conviction, faces up to 
30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson herself agrees that pregnant addicts should be held responsible for the 
well-being of their unborn children. But she believes that expanded and 
possibly mandatory drug treatment, not prosecution, is the best answer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Started With Me' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think women should be found guilty, but they should be accountable," 
she said in an interview. "If people are not held accountable for what they do, 
how do they ever get a grip on the problem? I guess they started with me." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who grew up in a well-kept cinder block house on the fringe of an 
all-black and desperately poor hollow, was schooled in the Scriptures by a 
devoutly religious mother. In the rutted dirt streets surrounding her 
neighborhood, however, crack was the major industry and recreation, and Johnson 
succumbed soon after graduation from high school. She married a drug dealer at 
20 and, by the time she was arrested, had four children and a $500-a-day habit. 
</P>
<P>
"During the first two years, I chose to do drugs," Johnson said. "I liked 
getting high. But the last two years, I couldn't help myself. I tried to stay 
clean every day, but there was always drugs around." 
</P>
<P>
She said she did no drugs during her first pregnancy but will not discuss the 
second. She admits her addiction during the last two. None of the children, now 
in the care of Johnson's mother and aunt, show signs of drug impairment, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that it was wrong, but I wasn't fully aware of the damage that I could 
have done," said Johnson, who hopes that she will be given a lengthy probation 
rather than a jail term. "I knew I couldn't take care of my children. I'm an 
addict, but now I'm doing something about it. I don't want to be the person I 
was four months ago."

In the second attack on his home in two months, a man found his house defaced 
in the latest in a series of attacks on gays by assailants espousing hatred of 
homosexuals, San Francisco police said. Glen Eichelberger awoke on his 44th 
birthday to find anti-gay epithets painted on the stucco wall of his Sunset 
District house. The vandals also splashed Eichelberger's car with red paint. 
"This is terrorism," Eichelberger said. Also scrawled on the wall were the 
letters "SDI," which police say stands for Sunset District Inc., a gang of 
white youths espousing a white-power philosophy that includes hatred of Jews 
and homosexuals, among others. Eichelberger's home was attacked about two 
months ago by vandals who stole a gay pride flag and returned it half burned 
with black swastikas and anti-gay slogans written on it, police said. 
Eichelberger speculated that his work volunteering for AIDS victims may have 
motivated the vandals' action. Police said they have stepped up patrols in the

Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti won a final vote of confidence for his 
five-party government and appealed to Italians to fight the "murderous and 
corrupting" influence of organized crime. The Chamber of Deputies (lower house) 
voted 371 to 200 for Italy's 49th post-World War II government, giving it full 
powers to tackle urgent problems listed by Andreotti as the Mafia, preparation 
for the 1992 single European market, drugs and tax evasion. An official crime 
report published last week said the Sicilian Mafia and its counterparts in 
Naples and Calabria had taken the place of left and right-wing guerrilla 
violence as the biggest threat to the security of the state.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," said President 
Bush has offered no substance to back up his professed commitment to civil 
rights. He faulted Bush for supporting recent Supreme Court rulings opposed by 
civil rights leaders, for failing to strengthen the Civil Rights Commission and 
for lacking a comprehensive plan to fight drugs. Jackson assailed Bush's 
nomination of black lawyer William Lucas to serve as the Justice Department's 
chief civil rights advocate, saying Lucas lacked trial experience.

The supporters and opponents of Folsom's slow-growth initiative agree that the 
city needs a second traffic bridge over the American River. But they cannot 
agree where the bridge should be built. And the two sides are far apart in 
their interpretation of what Measure N, to be on the ballot Aug. 22, says about 
a second bridge for Folsom. Proponents said the initiative requires the city to 
study the possibility of building the bridge just below Folsom Dam. A "yes" 
vote also will prohibit the building of a bridge over Oak Avenue Parkway or 
other areas leading into residential streets. Opponents say the measure is 
confusing. Some believe that it mandates a bridge below the dam while others 
say the language in the initiative is so unclear that lawyers will be working 
overtime to interpret it.

Rescue workers in southern Chile said 21 coal miners are feared dead after a 
wall gave way, filling the mine shaft with floodwaters caused by heavy rains. 
Divers entered the mine after pumps working through the night failed to lower 
the water level in the shaft in Chile's main coal-mining region, 450 miles 
south of the capital, Santiago. Firefighters said that an adjacent, abandoned 
mine filled up with water during heavy rainfall in the last week, and the 
pressure burst a wall separating the two shafts. Only four miners who were 
working near the surface managed to escape the rush of water.

Tortilla vendors, defying strict government price controls, raised the price on 
the staple by 45% in Mexico City, the government newspaper El Nacional said. 
The paper said its reporters encountered indignation among homemakers during a 
tour of tortilla factories over the weekend. The official price of tortillas is 
275 pesos a kilo, or about 6 cents a pound. But over the weekend, tortillas 
were selling for 400 pesos a kilo in most shops, or about 8 cents a pound, the 
paper said. The price increase came in defiance of a nationwide pact on wage 
and price controls that was put in place after inflation hit a record 159% in 
1987.

More than half the men arrested in 14 major cities who volunteered for drug 
testing were found to have ingested at least one drug, the Justice Department 
said. The highest percentage of drug use, 82%, was discovered in Philadelphia, 
followed by San Diego with 80%, according to the Drug Use Forecasting study by 
the National Institute of Justice. "There should be no longer any question as 
to how much of a catalyst for crime the lust for illegal drugs has become in 
America today," Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said. "Drug users and traffickers 
will beat, rob and kill anyone for drugs and profits."

In his final days in office, Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. personally 
approved consulting contracts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, according 
to Department of Housing and Urban Development officials who contend that in 
one case Pierce overruled lopsided opposition from department experts. The two 
contracts were earmarked for firms with ties to a former Pierce deputy and a 
prominent black Republican couple, said the officials, who asked not to be 
identified. Despite Pierce's endorsement, the contracts were eventually put on 
hold by the new officials at HUD. Jack Flynn, a department spokesman, said both 
projects are being reviewed and other officials said agency experts contend the 
contracts are unnecessary and poorly designed.

ABORTION, CRIME PACK DOUBLE THREAT IN GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A combustible mix of two hot issues -- abortion and crime -- has suddenly 
engulfed the California governor's race a full year before the election. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a quickly formed coalition of women's groups will charge that Republican 
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, now running for governor, is pushing a ballot initiative 
on crime that could threaten a woman's right to abortion in California. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's aides, who have worked for years to groom his moderate image, are 
scrambling to control the damage. 
</P>
<P>
And on Tuesday, the state's district attorneys, convening in Santa Barbara, are 
expected to blast Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, also running for 
governor, for suddenly raising the abortion issue in relation to the crime 
initiative. He will attend their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's aides -- who already must fight a Republican allegation that he 
is soft on crime because he opposes the death penalty -- are trying to limit 
their damage. 
</P>
<P>
And what is striking to political strategists on both sides is that one of the 
state's most controversial figures, former California Supreme Court Justice 
Rose Elizabeth Bird, is hanging over all this -- three years after a 
grass-roots movement got her removed from the court. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of the current fury is the Crime Victims' Justice Reform Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
If it qualifies for the June, 1990, ballot and is approved by the voters, it 
would amend the California Constitution in ways directed at the Bird court's 
expansion of the rights of the accused. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would make it easier, for example, for prosecutors to seek the 
death penalty; Bird never voted for the death penalty in any decision. 
</P>
<P>
The current political controversy, however, centers on Bird's interpretation of 
the privacy clause in the California Constitution. For example, in a 1983 case, 
People vs. Crowson, she argued that California's constitutional right to 
privacy supersedes the less restrictive U.S. constitutional rules on search and 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
In the case cited, a man named Earl Bradley Crowson talked about his crime in 
the back of a police car and his conversation, captured on a police tape 
recorder in the car, was later used against him. 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable 
search and seizure, that conversation would have been permissible as evidence. 
Bird said it was not permissible under California's guarantee of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
So the crime initiative drafted by the district attorneys contains the 
following language: 
</P>
<P>
"In criminal cases, the right of a defendant to . . . privacy . . . shall be 
construed by the courts in this state in a manner consistent with the 
Constitution of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
But last week, Van de Kamp -- whose political base includes a number of groups 
who backed Bird -- announced that he could not support the crime initiative 
because that same clause aimed at search-and-seizure cases might one day be 
used to make it a crime to get an abortion in California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Privacy and Abortion 
</P>
<P>
His theory is that the privacy provision enshrined in the California 
Constitution guarantees women an unassailable right to abortion. The U.S 
Constitution, which the crime initiative would require California to follow, 
affords no such protection for women. Thus, he maintains, with the privacy 
shield removed the day could come when the Legislature passes a law 
criminalizing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
As the positions harden, Wilson is inextricably linked to the crime initiative. 
Not only is he honorary chairman and fund-raiser, but his gubernatorial 
campaign's office is next door to that of the crime initiative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson also knows that, according to opinion polls, a majority of 
California voters are pro-choice on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
And so is he. It is his advisers' major defense against the Democrats' charge 
that Wilson's strong support for military spending and his backing of 
conservative judicial appointments make him a right-winger. 
</P>
<P>
Now, today, Wilson will find himself being attacked at press conferences 
throughout the state by a coalition of women's groups that includes Republicans 
for Choice, the California Women Lawyers and the National Council of Jewish 
Women, all with members who could potentially be Wilson voters. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's problem in this controversy is that his objection to the crime 
initiative further identifies him with the left at a time when the state has 
grown more conservative, particularly on the crime issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quite a Reach' 
</P>
<P>
Even Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who shares Van de Kamp's West Los 
Angeles liberal base, thinks the attorney general's objection to the crime 
initiative is shaky. 
</P>
<P>
After considering Van de Kamp's argument about the potential danger to abortion 
rights, Reiner said in an interview last week, "That appears to be quite a 
reach." 
</P>
<P>
Although Reiner acknowledges that Van de Kamp has raised a legitimate point, he 
adds that "this initiative does not amend the Constitution as to substantive 
law, only procedural (relating to search and seizure procedures)." 
</P>
<P>
Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, Van de Kamp's opponent for the 
Democratic gubernatorial nomination, recently endorsed the crime initiative but 
now is asking the state's top legal scholars whether Van de Kamp or Wilson and 
Reiner have the strongest position on the privacy issue.

12% TO 15% INSURANCE PROFITS OK, NADER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CORONADO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the surprise and cheer of insurance industry representatives, consumer 
advocate Ralph Nader said Sunday that under the terms of Proposition 103, as 
rewritten by the California Supreme Court, companies might be entitled to a 12% 
to 15% annual profit. 
</P>
<P>
Under May's high court decision, Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie is 
supposed to assure that the companies receive a "fair and reasonable rate of 
return" when she decides on exemptions from Proposition 103-mandated rollbacks 
and approves proposed new rates submitted by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Examination of Books Urged 
</P>
<P>
Nader cautioned that, before the bottom line is calculated, there has to be 
careful examination of each company's books by Gillespie to determine whether 
it is holding excess money in reserve and whether its stated costs are 
reasonable. But his endorsement of the 12% to 15% profit heartened insurers 
attending the annual convention of the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers 
of California and appeared to cause some discomfort to Proposition 103 author 
Harvey Rosenfield. 
</P>
<P>
Nader, Rosenfield and a number of insurance industry representatives were 
appearing in a lengthy debate that marked the opening session of the convention 
at the Hotel del Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what was said had been heard many times before, but Nader's use of 
specific figures to describe a permissible insurance company profit went beyond 
what even Gillespie has been willing to do. She has steadfastly avoided citing 
any numbers as a reasonable profit. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference that followed the debate, Robert Vagley, president of the 
American Insurance Assn., said that 12% to 15% would be "a far more generous 
rate of return than the industry has seen in California" and that if Gillespie 
should adhere to such a standard, "it would put upward pressure on rates." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield, asked if he agreed with Nader, said, "I think it's a mistake to 
focus on a number." In setting rates of return, he said, regulators should 
distinguish between efficient insurance companies and the "typical slothful, 
wasteful" ones. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the few times in the long, contentious debate over insurance 
issues in California that Rosenfield had taken even mild exception to anything 
Nader has said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Vagley's prediction of upward pressure on rates, Nader said he is 
convinced that the recent insurance price spiral in California will come to an 
end even under Gillespie, whom he has criticized as too pro-industry and urged 
to resign. 
</P>
<P>
When rate regulation begins, Nader said, "there's no way rates are going to be 
as high as they would have been without regulation." 
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives, however, suggested that the costs of regulation by 
themselves may contribute to higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nader Paid $10,000 
</P>
<P>
Jerry O'Kane, executive director of the agents and brokers association, said 
Nader was paid $10,000 to appear at the convention while Rosenfield and J. 
Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, were 
each paid $2,500. Four industry representatives in the debate appeared without 
charge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In welcoming remarks to the 1,550 delegates, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), who 
plans to be a candidate for governor next year, said a New York-style no-fault 
insurance plan "is something that might be looked at in California." 
</P>
<P>
Under the New York system, lawsuits are sharply curtailed, motorists collect 
most of their losses from their own insurance companies and there is strict 
rate regulation. Benefits are quite generous, but the plan has succeeded for 
the most part in keeping price increases down in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that, as a lawyer, he believes "the legal profession is very costly 
to the consumers of this nation" and cutting their role in the system would 
save everyone money. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Tom Conneely, president of the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, 
said most estimates are that installation of a New York-style no-fault in 
California would result in only a 0% to 4% immediate decrease in prices. Its 
main advantage, he said, would be to stem future price increases.

BUILDER WON IMPROPER HUD SALE, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A key Washington official in the developing HUD scandal gave preferential 
treatment to a company headed by Newport Beach developer William Lyon, a major 
Republican contributor, by selling him 827 acres in south Orange County even 
though his bid was the lowest of four reviewed, according to a HUD internal 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, obtained by 
the Long Island newspaper Newsday and published Sunday, says Shirley M. 
Wiseman, a former acting assistant secretary with the agency in 1985, appointed 
an internal committee that recommended the sale to Lyon, despite a warning from 
HUD's general counsel "that the William Lyon Company's all-cash bid was not the 
best offer." 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of Wiseman's selection of Lyon adds to the recent spate of 
reports documenting widespread political favoritism in HUD's decision-making 
during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD report, issued several months after the 1985 transaction, concluded, 
"the bidding, negotiations and award practices appear to have been improperly 
adjusted to secure an award to the William Lyon Company." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon ended up buying Robinson Ranch, a scenic rural property near Mission 
Viejo, from HUD in 1985 for about $16 million, although HUD documents obtained 
by The Times estimate that the value of the property at the time was as high as 
$35 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon could not be reached for comment Sunday. Dale Catalde, director of 
operations for the firm, declined to comment saying that he was not involved in 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman, now president of the National Assn. of Home Builders, testified 
recently before a House committee investigating the HUD scandal and was praised 
for her refusal to obey orders from former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce and his 
top assistant, Deborah Gore Dean, when they allegedly sought approval for a 
housing project in North Carolina proposed by an influential Republican 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman, who now lobbies for developers seeking HUD projects, could not be 
reached Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overruled Opposition 
</P>
<P>
In his final days in office, Pierce personally approved consulting contracts 
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to HUD officials who say that 
in one case Pierce overruled lopsided opposition from department experts. 
</P>
<P>
The two contracts involved were earmarked for companies with ties to a former 
Pierce deputy and a prominent black Republican couple, said the officials, who 
asked anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Pierce's endorsement, the contracts were put on hold by the new HUD 
administration. HUD spokesman Jack Flynn said both projects are under review 
and other officials said HUD experts contend the contracts are unnecessary and 
poorly designed. 
</P>
<P>
HUD became involved in the Robinson Ranch property in 1981 when it gave the 
Ridgewood Development Co. of Costa Mesa a Title X loan guarantee for $35 
million to develop the site. In 1984, the property was seized by HUD when the 
project went into default. 
</P>
<P>
The Title X program was designed to encourage development of difficult 
projects, such as remote properties that require expensive preparation for 
construction. The present HUD secretary, Jack Kemp, recently stopped the 
program, partly because of the high number of defaults. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter and Confused 
</P>
<P>
Ridgewood President Harriet Harris has said she is bitter and confused about 
HUD's decision to sell the property before it considered a settlement in which 
her firm could renegotiate the loan. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD report published Sunday said Wiseman initially wanted to sell the 
property to Lyon based on his bid of $8.5 million, which was less than three 
other bids being considered. After the warning from HUD's general counsel, the 
report said Lyon submitted a second bid and was awarded the property by 
Wiseman's committee. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD report was critical of the process, because Lyon was allowed to submit 
a second bid based on a higher rate of development. It said the other firms 
were not given the opportunity to prepare a bid based on a higher rate of 
development and, if they had, their bids would have been better. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Baker, a HUD official who worked on the sale in Washington, told The 
Times that one of the other bidders -- Kaufman &amp; Broad Co. of Los Angeles 
-- protested the Lyon sale in a letter. The HUD report said the Kaufman bid 
would have been the highest if it had been modified the same way as Lyon's. The 
other bidders were Simpson/Marlboro Co. and San-Jack Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
After the sale, the report said Wiseman told one of the losing bidders that 
Lyon was selected "because it would rezone (from the original 525 units 
approved by Orange County supervisors) to 2,500 units to 3,000 and therefore 
HUD would receive more money." 
</P>
<P>
A representative from Kaufman &amp; Broad warned the Wiseman committee, 
however, that the issue of rezoning was "subjective," since it would need 
approval from the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon applied for an increase in the zoning on the property. But under pressure 
from development opponents, the supervisors only approved 530 additional homes. 
</P>

<P>
The Polish Communist Party has gone through a long, hard year, and is just 
rousing itself to a new and troubling idea: that the demands of a changing 
political world require, for the first time, a genuine submission to public 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski as their new leader Saturday, Polish 
Communists have turned to a combative and maverick politician whose principal 
job will be to promote at least the illusion that the Communists who have run 
the country for four decades have enough public support to continue running it. 
</P>
<P>
It is an uphill battle, if not altogether impossible, and Rakowski's best 
efforts may amount to little more than damage limitation after the party's 
embarrassing performance in the June elections, which brought Solidarity, the 
trade union movement, charging to the political forefront. Meanwhile, 
Communists had a hard time getting their candidates elected even when they ran 
unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the elections, and the yearlong turmoil inside the party have brought 
out suggestions that the party is in its last days and should reconstitute 
itself as a left-leaning "social democratic" party in the West European style. 
</P>
<P>
Rakowski, however, is having none of that -- at least for the moment. One of 
the wiliest political players in the country, he campaigned shrewdly for the 
top party post, drawing on his longtime loyalty to President Wojciech 
Jaruzelski, who resigned the party leadership along with his other party 
positions to devote full time to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski's endorsement was central, along with an appeal to party 
conservatives, who welcomed Rakowski's message that the party can survive 
without surrendering its Marxist principles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Turn for Party 
</P>
<P>
Rakowski's often antagonistic stance toward the opposition Solidarity and his 
appeal to hard-liners initially suggests a conservative turn in the party. 
Among his first appointments were two old-line party operatives, Manfred 
Gorywoda and Janusz Kubasiewicz, to the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps more significant were his first four appointments to posts in the 
Central Committee Secretariat, the party's executive arm, which has control 
over its day-to-day operation. Three of the new appointees, Marek Krol, 
Slawomir Wiatr and Marcin Swiecicki, are under 35 years old and such new faces 
that they were not even members of the Central Committee. The fourth, 
Wladzimierz Natorf, is Poland's 42-year-old ambassador to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
These appointments point to a recognition by Rakowski of the new importance of 
public accountability in the party's reckoning with the future. 
</P>
<P>
As the party discovered, to its shock, in the elections, there seem to be few 
Establishment Communist figures who can talk directly to the public without 
relying on the gobbledygook jargon of traditional Communist discourse. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the past, there was no real need for any plain talk, since elections 
were largely rigged affairs and competition a kind of listless charade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specter of Free Elections 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the party's long-running inability to manage the economy has 
forced it into accepting a political accommodation with the opposition 
Solidarity and -- for the party -- the even more haunting specter of fully free 
elections in four years. Without a major turnaround in its rock-bottom public 
support, free elections would effectively spell the end of the Communist Party 
as a political force in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The party is also forced, for the first time, to recognize both the power of 
the government and the National Assembly. In the past -- and yet today in most 
Communist countries -- the line between government structures and the party was 
thin or non-existent. Now, as the reawakening civil society asserts itself, the 
Communists are being forced to accept new limits to their power and influence. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee itself recognized the new reality in a resolution it 
adopted Saturday before electing Rakowski as the new party chief. 
</P>
<P>
"The party sees no return," the resolution said, "to the period when the views 
of the rank and file were disregarded, no return to the period when the views 
of the parliamentary deputies were disregarded, no return to the period when 
the views of the public were disregarded." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution amounted to both a remarkable confession as well as a pledge to 
do better. But, by itself, it is not likely to go far in winning the hearts and 
minds of Polish citizens, who have been listening to Communist "critical 
assessments" and reform pledges for years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rooting Out the Bureaucracy 
</P>
<P>
Rakowski's real battle to survive the public's demand for accountability will 
be to root out the entrenched bureaucracy well down the chain of party command 
-- in districts, cities and towns and throughout the country's industry. For, 
despite policy pronouncements at the top of the hierarchy, the party 
nomenklatura represents the most serious obstruction to reform, particularly in 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, in his new role as president, is expected today to submit his 
candidate for premier to the Sejm, the lower house of the National Assembly. 
And party sources, after Rakowski's election, were putting forward a new name 
as a likely candidate: Roman Malinowski, head of the United Peasants' Party, 
one of the parties allied with the Communists in the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion of Malinowski bears the hallmark of a Rakowski ploy. First, it 
would read well in the West, since it would mark the first time in 40 years 
that a non-Communist has headed the government. Second, it would saddle 
Malinowski with the responsibility for the serious price increases that are due 
to be enacted soon, as well as for more economic hardships over the coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
For Solidarity, the Rakowski appointment represents a challenge, for Rakowski 
has been pushing the opposition hard and has resisted the impulse, displayed by 
some party leaders, to play to the Solidarity audience. He has been advocating 
a free market for food (a radical reform step), while Solidarity, true to its 
trade union heritage, has advocated a slow transition to a free food market. 
</P>
<P>
Rakowski got his way Sunday when the government announced it was lifting price 
controls on most foods, starting Tuesday. Rakowski had argued that much of 
Poland's problem of food shortages is caused by farmers who are withholding 
meat and other products from the market because prices are insufficient. 
Solidarity, anticipating the move, said Saturday that price increases would 
bring "a danger of an outbreak of social dissatisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Direct Purchases From Farmers 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency PAP said that under the new pricing system, stores 
will be permitted to buy meat directly from farmers at a mutually-agreed price. 
Meat has been rationed since 1981 with each family member allowed to buy five 
pounds of meat from state stores at controlled prices. Poles could also buy 
meat at uncontrolled prices from private shops. 
</P>
<P>
PAP said that price controls will remain on bread, low-fat milk, cottage cheese 
and milk formula for infants. 
</P>
<P>
Rakowski's advocacy for a free market on prices signaled the likelihood that he 
will continue to be the most combative opponent Solidarity has to deal with in 
the coming months.

BLOCH WAS IN POSITION TO RECRUIT SPIES, EX-U.S. AIDE SAYS 
</P>

<P>
As the second in command at the American Embassy in Vienna, suspected spy Felix 
S. Bloch was in a good position to help the Soviet Union recruit other American 
officials to take part in espionage, a former high-level U.S. intelligence 
official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Top government officials are trying to assess the damage to U.S. security of 
Bloch's possible cooperation with the Soviet Union, and there are strong 
suspicions that his alleged actions might have been taken as part of a network 
of KGB informants. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, 54, was suspended from his State Department post in June after he 
allegedly was observed handing a briefcase to a KGB agent in Paris. U.S. 
officials have confirmed that Bloch is under investigation for possible 
espionage, but he has not been charged with any offense. 
</P>
<P>
At the time he was placed on leave, Bloch was working as director of the State 
Department's Office of Regional Political Economic Affairs in Washington. But 
his previous posting from 1980 to 1987 had been as chief deputy to the U.S. 
ambassador in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth deGraffenreid, former senior director of intelligence programs for the 
National Security Council, said that investigators are certain to be exploring 
the possibility that Bloch not only passed along government secrets to the 
Soviets but that he also helped the KGB recruit other Americans as spies while 
he was in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bloch case itself is consuming a lot of time because of the potential that 
he could have given information which would have allowed recruitments," 
deGraffenreid said on ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
"A man who's No. 1 or 2 in the embassy would know all the foibles -- who's 
disgruntled, whose wife is unhappy, the kind of little things that intelligence 
services look for when they go to recruit an American," deGraffenreid said. 
</P>
<P>
"An intelligence service would pay a fortune just for that kind of 
information," he said, "let alone the kind of specific negotiating positions, 
the feedback, that he could give them about . . . how the American government 
is reacting to Soviet moves." 
</P>
<P>
According to published reports, U.S. intelligence picked up through electronic 
surveillance a conversation in which Bloch was warned by his KGB handler that 
there was a "virus" spreading that might have "infected" him. The word "virus" 
was understood to be code for an FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph E. DiGenova, a former U.S. attorney, told ABC that the warning Bloch 
allegedly received suggests either that U.S. surveillance had been "too overt," 
even before the matter became public knowledge, or that other U.S. officials 
might have been involved in passing data to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
At present, Bloch is being tailed by a large contingent of FBI agents, Soviet 
Embassy representatives and American news reporters when he appears in public. 
The highly visible FBI surveillance is seen by government officials as a 
necessary step to prevent Bloch from possibly defecting while the investigation 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
DiGenova said that government investigators are in a difficult position because 
Bloch apparently did not divulge much information when he was interviewed by 
State Department and FBI officials on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
"And now that leaves the government with the option of figuring out how to 
prosecute him, if at all, and if not, at least to use information from him -- 
and how you get that is the next step," DiGenova said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what a defense lawyer might do in representing Bloch should he be 
charged, DiGenova replied that he would suggest that the government grant Bloch 
immunity from prosecution in exchange for his assistance in assessing the 
damage caused to U.S. national security by his activities. He noted that Bloch 
then could be imprisoned for contempt of court if he failed to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
While Bloch probably would go unpunished, he said, immunity would accomplish a 
valuable purpose. "The damage assessment is extremely important," he said.

ISRAEL SUPREME COURT RESTRICTS ARMY'S RIGHT TO DEMOLISH HOMES OF PALESTINIAN 
SUSPECTS

<P>
The Supreme Court on Sunday restricted the army's right to demolish homes of 
Palestinians suspected of involvement in the anti-Israeli uprising, saying the 
military must allow appeals before houses are destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
It was the court's strongest move to limit army powers during the 19-month-old 
uprising in the occupied lands. The practice of destroying homes has been 
denounced by the United States and other Western nations and human rights 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-page court ruling was in response to an appeal by the Assn. for Civil 
Rights in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member court ordered the army to inform owners of houses slated for 
demolition that they could appeal to a military commander and the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
It ruled that in some cases, a house may be sealed before the appeal hearing, 
"as opposed to demolition, which is irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Meir Shamgar said the army has the right to immediately 
demolish a house in case of "operational military needs," such as in combat. 
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman said 227 houses have been demolished in the occupied 
territories during the uprising. Palestinian groups say the number is higher. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department in February said the house demolitions violated the Geneva 
Conventions on human rights and ignored due process because suspects' houses 
were torn down before they were tried. 
</P>
<P>
"Israeli authorities took these actions . . . prior to trial and conviction," 
said the report. "The occupants, who are often served with the demolition order 
only hours before it is to be carried out, have no right of appeal." 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry responded by saying the measure was used "only in very 
exceptional circumstances as dictated by compelling security requirements." 
</P>
<P>
In court arguments, the state prosecutor's office and the army argued that an 
appeal period is granted automatically according to army policy, except in 
"serious and exceptional cases" that involve fatalities or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
In the occupied territories, meanwhile, five Palestinians died in the 
continuing violence and Israeli police raided the offices of Rabbi Meir 
Kahane's militantly anti-Arab Kach movement. 
</P>
<P>
A Jewish settler shot and killed a Palestinian during stone-throwing clashes in 
the Gaza Strip, three Arabs died of army gunshot wounds and another was beaten 
to death by fellow Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
In a crackdown on Jewish militants, police entered the Jerusalem headquarters 
of the Kach movement and arrested eight militant Israelis on suspicion they 
were fomenting rebellion as members of the "Free State of Judea," which calls 
for founding a Jewish nation in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
One of the five Arabs who died was killed when a settler from Rafiah Ram opened 
fire after his car was stoned near Beit Hanoun, police sources said.

HANOI OKS EXODUS TO U.S. OF FREED POLITICAL PRISONERS

The United States and Vietnam on Sunday announced an agreement for former 
political prisoners and their relatives to be resettled in the United States, 
with the first group of 3,000 expected to leave this year. 
</P>
<P>
A joint statement, released in Bangkok, said the two sides hope to begin by 
October "a program for the resettlement in the United States of released 
re-education center detainees and their close family members who wish to 
emigrate to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The Communists toppled the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government in April, 1975, 
and hundreds of thousands of people were put into the camps of manual labor and 
political re-education because of their ties to the old regime. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has sought a formal program for their resettlement since 
1982, but political bickering barred progress. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, in talks last week 
between teams led by Vu Khoan, Vietnamese assistant foreign minister, and 
Robert L. Funseth, U.S. senior deputy assistant secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
Funseth said the pact "starts healing the last big wound remaining from the 
war, which is that these people who were clearly associated with the United 
States have not been allowed to leave Vietnam and be united with their 
relatives. . . . "

SKINHEADS WHO TRY TO DO RIGHT THING; 
</P>
<P>
NOT ALL YOUTHS SPORTING CLOSE-CROPPED HAIR AND WEARING COMBAT BOOTS ARE 
NEO-NAZI THUGS, AND SOME ARE EVEN ORGANIZING TO CLEAN UP THEIR RACIST, VIOLENT 
IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Subdued in a manner belying their image, about 50 "skinheads" gathered at a San 
Fernando Valley park on a recent Saturday to listen in respectful silence to 
the words of one of their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Wear your (identity) with pride," said Todd Schwartz, glancing at his yellow 
armband. "You got to know who and what you are." 
</P>
<P>
Meet the self-described anti-racist skinheads, a breed apart from the 
better-known, hard-core variety. While they share many of the same interests of 
other skinheads, they also claim to pursue racial harmony and pacifism. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, certain elements of these youths' appearances made them readily 
identifiable as partisans of the youth subculture whose name of late has become 
almost synonymous with neo-Nazism. Nearly all of the boys and many of the girls 
sported short-cropped hair. Most wore combat boots. Many wore odd-colored 
suspenders. 
</P>
<P>
But scattered among what has come to be widely regarded as such easily 
recognizable symbols of defiance were some surprises as well. More than a third 
of the youths in the park were black, Latino or Asian. And they sported yellow 
armbands marked with the letters SHARP, an acronym for Skinheads Against Racial 
Prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
"Real skinheads aren't racist," said Iby Miranda, 16, a dark-skinned Latino 
high school student who favors short hair and black army boots. "Those who are 
are just bald punks." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the barrage of media coverage depicting skinheads as neo-Nazi thugs, this 
new voice is quietly attempting to gather strength. 
</P>
<P>
Members of these groups claim there are hundreds of anti-racist skinheads in 
Southern California. To make their points they are meeting in parks, picketing 
at concerts, distributing leaflets, recruiting members, holding rallies, 
publishing newsletters and generally conducting an aggressive grass-roots 
public relations campaign to get the word out that not all skinheads are 
racist. 
</P>
<P>
"We're providing the kids with an alternative," said Schwartz, 21. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Marine with the rank of lance corporal based at Camp Pendleton, Schwartz 
-- who is Jewish -- is the West Coast coordinator of SHARP, one of the largest 
and most visible of the loosely organized skinhead groups that call themselves 
"two-tone" to describe their racially integrated membership. Other such groups 
spotted in Southern California, police say, have included United Skins, the 
Mickey Mouse Club, the Mods, West Coast Front, Brotherhood Skins, Mad Skins and 
Anti-Racist Action. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nazis offered them a group," Schwartz said, "now we're offering them a 
group on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roots in '60s England 
</P>
<P>
The association between skinheads and racist sentiments goes back at least 20 
years to the British working-class neighborhoods in which the gangs of mostly 
white youth first began appearing. One of their favorite activities back then 
was beating up on Third World immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a general identification with the white working class, however, the 
violence never seemed attached to any particular ideology. That began changing 
a few years ago when American skinheads started mingling with organized 
neo-Nazi groups. And indeed, in the last three years law enforcement officials 
in 24 states have reported violent attacks by hard-core skinheads, whose number 
they estimate at about 3,500 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But two-tone skinheads say they are getting a bum rap. The vast majority of 
skinheads, Schwartz and others insist, are not neo-Nazi sympathizers at all. 
</P>
<P>
Largely nonviolent, these young people simply consider themselves 
nonconformists and embody a sort of ethic of individualism, they say. By 
focusing on the neo-Nazi skinheads, Schwartz said, the media have made life 
precarious for the others, many of whom have become the unwitting objects of 
ridicule and hostility that occasionally erupt into attacks on the skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
One ordinarily quiet Long Beach neighborhood, for instance, has been plagued 
all summer by violent altercations that local skinheads claim are provoked by 
more conservatively dressed youths ranging from surfers to preppies. The 
teen-age vigilantes, the skinheads said, attack them, wrongly assuming that 
they are Nazi sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
Such anti-racist claims are finding the support of a Southern California 
psychologist who studied skinheads after counseling some of them for doing 
poorly in school. After conducting random interviews with more than 150 
skinheads over several months at public gatherings in San Francisco, Boston and 
Los Angeles, psychologist Robert Butterworth said he found fewer than 10% who 
seemed to hold white supremacist views. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the sense that they are very angry toward the media," said Butterworth, 
who has offices in Downey and Los Angeles. "They feel that nobody is listening 
to their side." 
</P>
<P>
Many of them are simply young people who have a tremendous need to identify 
with their peers during the transition from childhood to independence, 
Butterworth said. "We are making them more dangerous than they really are," he 
said. "They have a hard edge, but I don't see them as hard on the inside." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials say they haven't yet seen any evidence of the 
"softer" side of skinheads. "The only skinheads who come to our attention are 
the ones that are (racist)," said Detective Michael Brandt, hate-crime 
coordinator for the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
After outgrowing the private San Fernando Valley garage in which it began 
meeting a year ago, SHARP -- whose meetings have reportedly been attended by as 
many as 200 youths -- recently moved its "headquarters" outdoors to the nearby 
park. Although the majority of members are male, there are also a significant 
number of female members who play equally active roles. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz estimates national membership at about 2,000, including 500 in seven 
California chapters. About 40% of the membership, he said, consists of 
skinheads who are members of racial and ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
But firm numbers are elusive, Schwartz admits, because the organization -- like 
the life style it represents -- remains unstructured. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all informal networking," said Schwartz, adding that meetings are 
announced by word of mouth and activities financed by special collections. 
"SHARP is more of a belief than an organization." 
</P>
<P>
While that belief officially shuns violence, many SHARP members say they will 
fight back against attackers. "We're passive aggressors," Miranda explained. 
"We won't go out and commit a violent act, but we will defend ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
That seemed evident in May when the group picketed an appearance at The Country 
Club -- a Reseda concert hall -- by the Cro-Mags, a band known to attract Nazi 
skinheads. Supported by a large crowd, some SHARP members got involved in a 
series of scuffles that drew coverage by several local television stations. And 
a protest at the Glendale Masonic Lodge resulted in cancellation of part of a 
conservative Bible study conference that the protesters considered racist. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere during the recent meeting in the park, however, was decidedly 
nonviolent. Conducted by Schwartz and Greg Lee, a black Granada Hills high 
school student who oversees the Los Angeles/Valley chapter, the meeting 
included the announcement of a proposed anti-graffiti project, discussion of an 
upcoming camp-out at Lake Elsinore and an impromptu birthday party for 
Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward the young skinheads, reveling in their camaraderie through a 
childlike game of tag, spoke of the dilemma they face. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in this," said Paula Lazear, 15, a Reseda high school student of 
Filipino and French descent. "We're getting screwed both ways. We're getting 
jumped by 'white power' and jumped by people who think that we're 'white 
power.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dan Jones, a 20-year-old Marine from Camp Pendleton, boiled his philosophy down 
to a simple equation. "Skinheads are pro-American," he said. "Nazis don't 
support America."

MAN KILLED BY GANG AS HE ADMIRES VIEW AT PALISADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A West Los Angeles man who was showing friends the view from a hillside in 
Pacific Palisades was shot and killed by gang members who were also visiting 
the popular gathering spot, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
There are no suspects in the slaying of Efigenio Vital, 20, who went to 
Asilomar Boulevard in the affluent seaside community on the Westside with 
several friends from Azusa, Los Angeles Police Detective Bill Humphry said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred early Sunday morning as 250 police officers swept through 
South-Central Los Angeles neighborhoods that are more commonly associated with 
gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
The "Operation Hammer" sweeps resulted in more than 140 arrests but could not 
prevent the death of a 22-year-old woman, who was shot as she stepped outside a 
home in the Crenshaw District. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said the Pacific Palisades shooting was an anomaly, not part 
of a gang incursion into the community. 
</P>
<P>
Vital and several friends apparently drove to the cul-de-sac at the end of 
Asilomar Boulevard above Pacific Coast Highway to enjoy the ocean view 
Saturday, Humphry said. 
</P>
<P>
Another car arrived after midnight. Its occupants called out the name of a 
gang, then fired several shots, fatally wounding Vital, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
Vital's friends drove south along Pacific Coast Highway to Santa Monica, where 
they contacted a police officer who was making a traffic stop. Paramedics 
responded, but Vital died by the side of the highway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Vital and his friends had no apparent gang affiliation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors along Asilomar said young people routinely gather at the dead-end 
north of Temescal Canyon Road to drink and socialize. The police have been 
called before, but usually for nothing more serious than littering or 
disturbing the peace. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a place where people know there's a view," said one resident, who 
asked not to be named. "There's been more of it recently than in the past. . . 
. Yes, it's unsettling." 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor woman agreed, saying: "It's getting out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Another Asilomar Boulevard resident said he does not believe that any part of 
the city is immune to gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't surprise me, to tell you the truth," said the man, who also 
requested anonymity. "This is a city where it's going to get worse before it 
gets better." 
</P>
<P>
Two hours after Vital died, Sophia Barclay, 22, was shot and killed as she 
visited with a group of friends in a home in the 5300 block of South Ruthelen 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Barclay had opened the door of the duplex to give the group some air when 
someone fired 15 to 20 shots at the home, police said. Two other women were 
injured in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Paul Mize said the motive for the shooting is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officers taking part in the gang sweeps arrested 144 people. Gang 
members made up about half of the suspects picked up for crimes ranging from 
drunk driving and drug possession to weapons violations and outstanding 
warrants, said Officer Al Civitate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just your average Saturday night out there," Civitate said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar operation was scheduled for Sunday night, police said.

RAIDERS REPORTEDLY OK 'FRAMEWORK' OF OAKLAND OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Raiders have approved the "framework" of a proposal to bring 
the team back to Oakland, an Alameda County supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the team, Oakland, Alameda County and the Oakland Coliseum will 
start face-to-face talks today that could lead to a tentative agreement by the 
end of the week, Supervisor Don Perata said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're moving into the final stages and working toward a written tentative 
agreement," Perata told the Tribune of Oakland. "The elements are there to make 
a final deal." 
</P>
<P>
Perata said talks will be based on the proposal that the city, county and 
Coliseum sent to the Raiders about two weeks ago after months of meetings to 
put together a package of cash and stadium improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor said he had contacted local officials involved in the proposal 
about the team's response, including Mayor Lionel Wilson, but none could be 
reached for comment, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
But George Vukasin, president of the Coliseum board, said he had not been 
contacted about any response from the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"If there were any validity to (the response), someone would have called me," 
he said. "I haven't heard anything from anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Vukasin added that lawyers for the Coliseum will not meet with anyone until he 
hears of it first. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders officials and spokesmen could not be reached Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Perata said that he had not seen the team's response but that it was delivered 
Friday night by the Raiders' principal owner, Jack Brooks, to Ed de Silva, a 
Hayward contractor who is a leader in the effort to return the team to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
De Silva told him "we're not at the finish line yet, but nothing in response 
from the Raiders represents an insurmountable obstacle," Perata said. De Silva 
also could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
The Tribune quoted sources that said the 100-page proposal involves paying the 
Raiders a $32-million "franchise fee." The money would be raised with revenue 
bonds issued by the Coliseum, which is owned by Oakland and Alameda County. The 
city and county would also raise up to $50 million to expand the 53,000-seat 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Sacramento and Los Angeles-area cities have submitted proposals 
to lure the team, but Perata said Oakland is the only site the Raiders are 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders moved from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982. The team's lease with 
the Los Angeles Coliseum expires after the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sacramento Union reported Sunday that construction of the Arco 
Sports Complex -- a new 72,000-seat outdoor stadium designed for football and 
baseball -- resumed in Sacramento. The Sacramento Sports Assn. is negotiating 
with Raiders owner Al Davis to bring the team to Sacramento, but no agreement 
is in place. The stadium is expected to be ready in time for the 1991 NFL 
season.

2 HEART DRUGS REMAIN USEFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two heart drugs that were dropped from a federal study earlier this year are 
still important in the treatment of patients with life-threatening irregular 
heartbeats, a Food and Drug Administration expert said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Temple, director of one of two FDA offices of drug evaluation, said 
that although the drugs encainide and flecainide are no longer recommended for 
use by patients with mild heartbeat problems, the drugs give doctors another 
way to possibly control very serious cardiac irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
"The drugs are useful for those people who are in a fairly desperate 
situation," he said in an interview. "There are a lot of drugs (to treat heart 
disease) and none of them work all the time. You need a full complement of 
drugs in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
Encainide is marketed by Bristol-Myers under the brand name Enkaid, and 
flecainide is sold by 3M Riker under the name Tambocor.

BOY STRUCK WITH BAT LEAVES HOSPITAL; PROGNOSIS BRIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joshua Garrett, the 9-year-old boy whose skull was fractured last week by 
someone swinging a bat, was released Sunday night from Children's Hospital, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua has progressed rapidly and is expected to fully recover, said hospital 
spokesman Mark Morelli. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett was struck on the back of the head as he rode to a convenience store in 
south San Diego on his sister's bicycle. A car drove up behind him, and one of 
the passengers struck him, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two teen-age boys were arrested in connection with the attack and are expected 
to appear at a detention hearing Tuesday in Juvenile Court. Prosecutors want to 
try the teen-agers as adults. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a fund has been established by a group of recent nursing-school 
graduates to defray the boy's medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt there was a need," said Marcia Miles of her decision to help set 
up the fund. "I feel like the community better start caring around here and get 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Donations can be sent to the Joshua Leon Garrett Fund, Bank of America, 1775 
Camino de la Reina, San Diego, CA 92108.

TRIAL OF DEFENDANT IN SLAYING OF THREE IN GARAGE GOES TO JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury will begin deliberations today in the trial of Hector Ayala, 36, charged 
with taking part in the killing of three men in a Southeast San Diego garage 
during a drug-related shooting in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The jury heard final arguments in the trial Friday. Hector Ayala's brother, 
Ronaldo Ayala, 37, was convicted last year in the same killings and later 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
If the jury finds that Hector Ayala is guilty of first-degree murders with 
special circumstances, because there were multiple victims, a penalty-phase of 
the trial will be held later to determine whether he should be sentenced to 
death or life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
The killings took place April 26, 1985, in a radiator shop on South 43rd 
Street. The three victims were tied, had their mouths covered with duct tape, 
and then shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Slain were Ernesto (Cha Cho) Mendez Dominguez, 30, his brother-in-law, Marco 
Zamora-Villa, 31, and Jose (Cucuy) Luis Rositas, 24. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth victim, Pedro Castillo, 42, survived and testified that the Ayala 
brothers were the gunmen. Costillo was shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo has testified that heroin was being sold out of the garage by some of 
the victims and admitted he had not always been truthful with the police about 
that aspect of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
A third defendant in the killings, Jose Moreno, 50, is to be tried following 
Hector Ayala's trial.

S.D. PRISONERS RANK HIGH IN DRUG USE TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large majority of those arrested in 14 major cities nationwide -- including 
80% in San Diego -- tested positive during the last three months of 1988 for at 
least one of 10 illegal drugs, according to the National Institute of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the men tested for drug use were arrested for felony offenses other 
than the sale or possession of drugs, said the institute, the principal 
criminal justice research branch within the Justice Department's Office of 
Justice Programs. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 14 cities, the percentage of arrested males who tested positive for any 
of the 10 drugs was as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia, 82%; San Diego, 80%; New York and Chicago, 78%; New Orleans, 75%; 
Birmingham and Portland, 70%; Detroit, 69%; Cleveland, 68%; Dallas and Phoenix, 
57%; St. Louis, 56%; and, Kansas City, 54%. 
</P>
<P>
In the District of Columbia, 68% of those arrested tested positive for drug use 
but the D.C. Pretrial Service Agency did not test for marijuana during the 
fourth quarter of 1988, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women Equal to Men 
</P>
<P>
Institute Director James Stewart said the study found that among those 
arrested, women tested positive for illicit drugs at about the same rates as 
men at all test sites. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, in some cities the percentage of females who tested positive for 
cocaine was higher than it was for men," Stewart said. "For many years, it had 
been thought that males were more likely than were women to be illicit drug 
users." 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than half of the men charged with homicide tested positive for an 
illicit drug, the institute said, while almost three-fourths of the males 
arrested for robbery in 13 cities tested positive for one or more drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The meaning of this study is twofold," Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said. 
"There should be no longer any question as to how much of a catalyst for crime 
the lust for illegal drugs has become in America today. Drug users and 
trafficker drug crimes have increased to record levels. It is equally clear 
that law enforcement alone will never win the war on drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Data for the study was derived from anonymous and voluntary urine specimens and 
interviews of samples of people arrested for serious crimes, the institute 
said. The tests looked for recent use of cocaine, marijuana, opiates, PCP, 
amphetamines, Darvon, Valium, methaqualone, methadone and barbiturates. 
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of those arrested were using drugs, they did not report 
the need for treatment, the institute said, adding that only about one quarter 
said they were in current need of drug- or alcohol-abuse treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"This suggests the need for improved supervision, monitoring, or court-mandated 
requirements for arrestees to stay off drugs and get treatment," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
The institute said the study could have public health implications, noting that 
about 25% of those tested in 13 cities reported during the interviews that they 
had injected drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"This suggests that many criminal suspects are at a risk for hepatitis, HIV 
infection, or developing AIDS -- and they are very likely to spread these 
diseases to the general population," Stewart said. "This reinforces the need to 
require defendants to remain drug-free." 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights from the report include: 
</P>
<P>
* Both long-term and short-term trends show dramatic increases in cocaine use, 
including cocaine powder and crack. Between May, 1984 and November, 1988, 
cocaine use in the District of Columbia more than tripled, rising from 18% of 
those arrested to 62%. 
</P>
<P>
* About 82% of the men arrested in Philadelphia tested positive for at least 
one illegal drug. About 75% of the men arrested in that city had been using 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
* Cocaine use in New Orleans grew from 36% to 64% among arrested males in about 
a year. Among arrested females, it grew from 30% to 52%.

JURY STILL REVIEWS KILLER'S WORDS IN SANITY TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The jury that is to decide whether Toufic Naddi was sane or insane when he 
killed five family members in 1985 will continue today to listen to testimony 
he gave at his first trial last year. 
</P>
<P>
Court reporters began rereading Naddi's testimony to the San Diego Superior 
Court jury last Wednesday . 
</P>
<P>
Naddi, 48, of El Cajon, was convicted June 8 of the first-degree murders of his 
wife, her parents, and two in-laws in El Cajon on June 1, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The first jury deadlocked 11-1 on whether Naddi was sane at the time of the 
murders. A second jury is now attempting to determine Naddi's mental state at 
the time of the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Naddi's attorney, Hodge Crabtree, argued last week that Naddi was insane, and 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bob Boles said he was sane. 
</P>
<P>
If found to have been insane, Naddi would be committed to a mental hospital for 
the criminally insane, but could eventually be released if he proved he had 
regained his sanity. 
</P>
<P>
If the jury determines Naddi was sane, the trial moves into the penalty phase. 
The jury would then decide whether to recommend that Naddi be put to death or 
be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
In this second trial, Naddi has refused to testify, so his comments are being 
read back. Last year, Naddi spent three days on the stand detailing how he shot 
each victim and why. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed his father-in-law, Habib Sabbagh, 73, was "a sex maniac" who had 
molested Naddi's wife, Aida Naddi, 26, and said he killed them as part of God's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that God had set up this situation, and it was His will that I kill 
these people," Naddi testified then. 
</P>
<P>
Naddi said his mother-in-law, Lillian Sabbagh, 58, was "involved in the incest 
matter herself," so he killed her too. 
</P>
<P>
Also shot repeatedly in the head were Michael Sabbagh, 38, a cousin, and Osama 
Mashini, 38, a brother-in-law and a comedian/actor in Jordan. The Sabbagh 
family was wealthy and well-known in Amman, Jordan.

RACING AT DEL MAR; 
</P>
<P>
ON THE LINE IS FIRST TO THE FINISH LINE IN CROSBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a pair of disappointing detours to pastures not so green, Eugene Klein's 
On the Line resurfaced Sunday at Del Mar with a breathtaking five-length 
victory in the $108,800 Bing Crosby Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Running the six furlongs in 1:08, just one-fifth of a second off the stakes 
record, the 4-year-old chestnut humbled a field that included defending Crosby 
champion Olympic Prospect and the streaking Sam Who. In the process, On the 
Line reclaimed bragging rights as the country's top sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
On paper, the Crosby shaped up as anything but a romp. But at six furlongs, 
even the fastest thoroughbred cannot afford the slightest mistake, and Sam 
Who's race was over before it began. 
</P>
<P>
Favored at 8-5 in the field of seven and trying for his sixth straight win, Sam 
Who eliminated himself at the start, stumbling out of the gate. Making things 
worse, Olympic Prospect swerved inward and sideswiped the little gelding. 
Jockey Laffit Pincay knew he had lost any chance. 
</P>
<P>
"He broke so fast, the ground broke out from under him," Pincay said of Sam 
Who. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect, the 2-1 second choice, had no excuse in terms of racing luck. 
His fate was likely determined by trainer John Sadler's decision to run just 
eight days after Olympic Prospect's 11 1/2-length win in a race at Louisiana 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
But the big gelding appeared fit and fresh, and he even had an accommodating 
lead down the backstretch. With Alex Solis sitting chilly, Olympic Prospect 
cruised along with his customary grace. On the Line, in second place, was his 
only serious pursuer. 
</P>
<P>
After a half-mile in :43 4/5, however, it was clear that Olympic Prospect was 
in trouble. By way of comparison, he ran the first half of the 1988 Crosby in 
:43 2/5 and went on to win by 1 1/4 lengths. Gary Stevens brought On the Line 
alongside at the head of the stretch and took the lead with a slingshot move 
that ended the suspense in just a few strides. 
</P>
<P>
As Olympic Prospect backed up through the field, Speedratic and Cresting Water 
came on to make it a race for second place. Speedratic, making his first start 
since Feb. 5, got the nod by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
On the Line carried top weight of 124 pounds and returned $8.60, $5.20 and 
$4.20. Speedratic paid $8 and $6.20, while Cresting Water returned $4.40. The 
exacta was worth $300.50. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who earned high marks for managing to finish fourth, beaten by just 1 1/4 
lengths for second money. Even Wayne Lukas, On the Line's trainer, had words of 
consolation for the connections of the frustrated favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt bad when he didn't break well," said Lukas, who is still wincing from 
the pain of a disk operation earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"But in my heart, I didn't think Sam Who was going to beat my horse even if he 
did break well. I think a horse was going to have to run about 1:07 3/5 to beat 
him today, and you just don't see that." 
</P>
<P>
Even Stevens was duly impressed by On the Line. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up a mount in the Kentucky Derby to ride him earlier this year in the 
Carter Handicap in New York," Stevens said. "That gives you an idea of what I 
thought of him." 
</P>
<P>
After winning three stakes races in his first four starts of 1989, On the Line 
turned in terrible races in the Metropolitan Mile in New York and in a 
Breeders' Cup-sponsored race at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"He just didn't like the grass at all in that last race," Lukas said. "I've 
never had any luck running him on the grass. But at six or seven furlongs, I 
think he's the best in the country." 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, Lukas will bring On the Line back in the seven-furlong Pat 
O'Brien Handicap at Del Mar Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dominant Dancer, leader of California's 2-year-old fillies, is coming back 
sooner than expected in Wednesday's Junior Miss Stakes at Del Mar. Trainer Don 
Harper is satisfied that her shin problem is under control, but the daughter of 
Moscow Ballet will have her work cut out. She breaks from Post No. 12 in a 
field of 12 going six furlongs. . . . Clover Racing Stable's Nediym, who 
finished a close second to El Senor in Saturday's Sword Dancer Handicap at 
Belmont, will make his next start in the $300,000 Del Mar Invitational on Labor 
Day. . . . Trainer Ross Fenstermaker and owner Fred Hooper are back together 
again for their fourth time around. Fenstermaker, who first went to work for 
the famed Florida breeder in 1953, has a fresh batch of Hooper 2-year-olds, 
while John Russell trains the rest of the California string. . . . Robbie Davis 
won two more races Sunday to maintain his lead in the Del Mar jockey standings.

NEW METHOD SUGGESTED TO PREVENT STEROIDS USE; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS SCIENTIST SAYS THAT COACHES SHOULD TRY STRESSING ETHICS WITH ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because there is no conclusive medical evidence to support the horror stories 
regarding long-term effects of anabolic steroids on an athlete's health, sports 
officials should emphasize ethics in their efforts to prevent use of the drugs, 
a leading sports scientist said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
That may not be the message many of the 75 participants in a two-day conference 
at the Amateur Athletic Foundation expected to hear from Dr. Charles Yesalis, 
professor of Health Policy and Administration, Exercise and Sports Science at 
Penn State University. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the AAF, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. and the National Federation of State High School Assns., the 
conference was advertised as the nation's "first consensus meeting on the 
dangers of steroid abuse." 
</P>
<P>
In literature and some medical journals, steroids have been linked to 
cardiovascular and liver disease, sexual dysfunction, tendon damage and other 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
But Yesalis labeled much of that information as "hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
"Some members of the sports medicine community have, with the best of 
intentions, adopted a conservative strategy and used strong, but often 
unfounded, pronouncements emphasizing the adverse, particularly permanent and 
lethal, health effects of anabolic steroids," Yesalis said. "Athletes, on the 
other hand, have simply not witnessed longtime anabolic steroid users dropping 
like flies. This aggressive health education strategy does not seem to have had 
any major impact on the use of steroids." 
</P>
<P>
Yesalis warned athletes not to mistake "absence of evidence" for "evidence of 
absence," and called for increased research. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the most significant reason for absence of action on this issue has 
been lack of awareness, until recently, by most of the medical community, 
government and the public regarding the extent of use of these drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There likely is a concern by some that if, in fact, no deleterious long-term 
effects are identified, the use of anabolic steroids would increase further, 
while the moral issue of fair play would remain. 
</P>
<P>
"Even more frustrating is the fact that in two recent national studies, the 
majority of anabolic steroid users surveyed expressed intentions to stop use if 
deleterious health effects were unequivocally established. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the lack of scientific information on the long-term health effect has 
impeded, if not precluded, the formulation of effective health education and 
drug abuse prevention strategies." 
</P>
<P>
Until that information is available, Yesalis suggested that sports officials 
educate athletes about the questionable ethics of using drugs to enhance 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
"To move toward a solution of this problem, sacrifices -- measured by fewer 
victories and lost revenues -- will probably have to be made by athletes, 
academic institutions and sports federations," he said. "Anabolic steroids work 
too well to believe otherwise."

MORNING BRIEFING: WITH PRESSURE ON, SEIFERT STRIKES BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Bill Walsh left the San Francisco 49ers to become an analyst for NBC-TV, 
he was asked how he thought the club would fare under new Coach George Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to put too much of an onus on George," he said, "but I think the 
49ers have as good a chance as anyone to repeat as world champions." 
</P>
<P>
Advised of Walsh's comment, Seifert told the Atlanta Journal and Constitution: 
"Not to put the onus on him or anything, but I'm sure he'll have the highest 
Nielsen ratings of all the broadcasters." 
</P>
<P>
Might is right: After disposing of Carl (the Truth) Williams with a left hook, 
Mike Tyson said: "My right hand is my better punch, but I never hit anyone with 
it. It's always the left hook. When I hit someone good with the right hand, 
then we'll see some action." 
</P>
<P>
By whom, the paramedics? 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What was the only World Series that matched the batting champions 
of both leagues? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Colemanism of the week: Said announcer Jerry Coleman on the CBS Radio game of 
the week when the count reached 3 and 0 on St. Louis outfielder Tom Brunansky: 
"You never want to come right down the middle on 3 and 0, no matter what the 
count." 
</P>
<P>
No joke: Said Marty Blake, NBA director of scouting, when told by the 
Sacramento Bee that Bill Russell, vice president and general manager of the 
Sacramento Kings, does not talk to the press: 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't? You're kidding. I don't understand that. What's the guy who owns 
the club think? You've got a general manager who doesn't talk to the press? 
I've never heard of anything like that. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, well, he doesn't talk to me, either." 
</P>
<P>
Just kidding: With Bart Giamatti among those in attendance, comedian Jay Leno 
got off this one at a baseball banquet: "A new survey shows that Americans have 
lost confidence in savings and loans. Sixty-three percent would rather have 
Pete Rose handle their money." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The 1954 World Series matched batting champions Bobby Avila of 
the Cleveland Indians and Willie Mays of the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Add Avila: Yogi Berra, in a discussion of the 1954 season, once said: "Bobby 
Avila had a good year for them. He got the MVP that year, I think. 1954? I'm 
pretty sure. Didn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer, of course, is no. The MVP that year was Yogi Berra. 
</P>
<P>
Netting a shark: From Ray Frager of the Baltimore Sun: "In a recent sweep of 
TV-satellite pirates in Las Vegas, one of the sports bars hit was Tarkanian's, 
as in Jerry Tarkanian, the Nevada Las Vegas basketball coach, who is viewed as 
something of a pirate by many in collegiate athletics." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Abe Lemons, Oklahoma City University basketball coach, on the perils 
of his profession: "Doctors bury their mistakes. Coaches still have theirs on 
scholarship."

MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
CHECKERED FLAG GOES UP EARLY, CAUSES CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Price Cobb of Evergreen, Colo., was leading the IMSA Grand Prix at Portland 
Sunday when the checkered flag was waved. There was one problem, though. There 
were still three laps to go in the 97-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb said he backed off, then resumed racing when he saw that Australian Geoff 
Brabham was still racing. Brabham caught Cobb two laps later and ended up 
winning by .345 of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb's Jaguar team protested, and the race will be reviewed. Official results 
are not expected until early in the week. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, a huge error was made," Brabham said. "It's not my department and 
I'm not going to speculate. My team told me it was a mistake, and the Jaguar 
team told Price it was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Labonte held off Darrell Waltrip to win the DieHard 500 stock car race at 
Talladega, Ala., by less than a car-length. 
</P>
<P>
Labonte, the 19th different winner in 21 summer races on the 2.66-mile 
Superspeedway oval, has come close before. He previously had three second-place 
finishes at Talladega, all by the narrowest of margins, and was third in the 
1981 race, when Ron Bouchard beat Waltrip and Labonte to the finish line by 
less than a yard. 
</P>
<P>
Labonte's victory in a Thunderbird gave Ford a five-race winning streak, its 
longest since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
The 188-lap race on the hot track saw 10 drivers change leads 49 times, the 
last coming on Lap 176 when Labonte drove his Thunderbird past Waltrip's 
Chevrolet Lumina. Waltrip stayed right behind Labonte but couldn't get past 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip remained second in the Winston Cup standings but gained 45 points on 
leader Dale Earnhardt, who finished 11th Sunday. Earnhardt has 2,444 points to 
Waltrip's 2,354. 
</P>
<P>
Labonte, who averaged 157.354 m.p.h., won $73,920. 
</P>
<P>
Ayrton Senna of Brazil won the German Grand Prix, finishing ahead of 
McLaren-Honda teammate Alain Prost of France. 
</P>
<P>
Senna passed Prost with two laps left in the 44-lap race on the 4.214-mile 
circuit at Hockenheim, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Senna finished the 185.41-mile race in 1 hour 21 minutes 43.302 seconds -- 
18.151 seconds ahead of Prost. He averaged 139.231 m.p.h.

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
TOLBERT SETS RECORD: 13.01 IN 100-METER HURDLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynda Tolbert of Arizona State set a U.S. Olympic Festival record in the 
women's 100-meter hurdles Sunday, winning in 13.01 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second festival gold medal for Tolbert, who also won the event in 
1987. Her time broke the mark of 13.04 set by Stephanie Hightower seven years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very hot and humid,"' Tolbert said. "I'm sweltering like a wet puppy, 
but otherwise it was OK." 
</P>
<P>
The temperature three feet above the surface of the John Jacobs track was 
measured at 103 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Tolbert, who lives in Washington, D.C., said she took it easy because of sore 
hamstrings. 
</P>
<P>
"I can go much, much faster," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonie Campbell of Ontario, Calif., the 1988 Olympic bronze medalist, pulled 
away to win the 110-meter hurdles in 13.54 seconds. NCAA champion Robert 
Reading of USC was a close second in 13.57. 
</P>
<P>
Debbi Lawrence, the 1988 Olympic trials champion in the women's 10-kilometer 
walk, won the event in 49:21.80. 
</P>
<P>
In the 20-kilometer walk, Richard Quinn of San Francisco won in 1 hour 32 
minutes 23 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Scoggin of Austin, Tex., nailed his final two dives to win the 10-meter 
platform gold medal. Scoggin trailed Scott Donie of Houston by 24 points after 
eight dives, then received scores of 86.40 and 81.60 to finish with 581.85 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Donie was second. 
</P>
<P>
The women's platform championship went to Cokey Smith of Ann Arbor, Mich., her 
first victory in a national meet. 
</P>
<P>
Bela Karolyi's gymnasts took eight of 12 medals on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Zmeskal, 13, of Houston, who won golds for the all-around and team 
competition Friday, got a gold and two silvers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Scherr, 14, of Cincinnati won the vault, and Erika Stokes, 13, won the 
balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
Only 12-year-old Shannon Miller, of Edmond, Okla., broke up Karolyi's 
Gymnastics' dominance by winning the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
"The flame is burning in gymnastics," Karolyi said. "Fifteen and 16 are the 
best years for gymnastics. These kids will all be 15 and 15 1/2 (for the 1992 
Olympics)." 
</P>
<P>
Rowing gold medals were won by Allan Green of Barrington, R.I., in men's single 
sculls; Linda Muri of Danielson, Conn., in women's singles sculls; Tim Huller 
of King of Prussia, Pa., and Tom Ferlick of Wayne, Pa., in junior men's 
doubles; Marty Patton of La Jolla and Megan Webster of Carlisle, Mass., in 
women's lightweight doubles, and David Kosicz, now living in Canada, and Stefan 
Benton of Mill Valley, Calif., in men's lightweight doubles.

MUSICIANS WHO CARE PERFORM FOR GOOD CAUSES

<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking to its roots in the '60s protest movement, rock 'n' roll is again 
becoming socially conscious, and more and more big names are getting involved. 
Live-Aid, USA for Africa, Jackson Browne's recent benefit tour for the Christic 
Institute, and Tom Petty's current tour with members of Greenpeace are just a 
few examples. 
</P>
<P>
According to Patricia Grimes, it's time lesser-known artists also get involved 
as well. Grimes, 34, is the founder and co-coordinator of Musicians Who Care, 
an all-volunteer organization with a goal of "bridging together music and 
social services." 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old group, based in Encinitas, is trying to get San Diego musicians 
to care, both about themselves and about others. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve the former, there are concerts showcasing local original-music bands 
in area nightclubs, a bimonthly newsletter to publicize these bands' latest 
deeds and accomplishments, a referral service to help them get gigs and a 
lecture series to help them gain a better understanding of the inner workings 
of the music business. 
</P>
<P>
And to achieve the latter, there are benefit concerts and fund-raisers for the 
homeless, the handicapped, local and national crisis-intervention hot lines and 
various human-rights and environmental groups, like Amnesty International and 
Clean Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is providing San Diego musicians with a multifaceted support 
network to make sure they do get the recognition they deserve -- not only by 
helping them, but by encouraging them to help themselves and become more active 
in their own community," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she added, "we're funneling some of this community activism 
we're building among local musicians -- this sense of caring we're instilling 
in them -- outside the San Diego music scene by supporting and raising money 
for charities, social-service agencies and environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not in a good place in your own life, you're not in a position to 
help anyone else," she said. "You've got your own problems to overcome, and 
without question, San Diego musicians have plenty of problems: not enough work, 
low pay, not enough exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"But once you start caring about yourself and find that by working together 
many of these problems can be overcome, you tend to start caring about others 
and their problems as well." 
</P>
<P>
The dual focus of Musicians Who Care -- working to improve the lot of San Diego 
musicians while simultaneously working to better the world around them -- is 
reflected in the background of its founder. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes, a native of Atlanta, spent the first half of her 34 years "immersed in 
music," she said. "My mom said that when I was born, I came out dancing. I took 
piano lessons, studied ballet and played flute and twirled the baton in my high 
school marching band. I even had my own rock band, playing school dances and 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
By the time she graduated from high school, however, Grimes had been 
brainwashed into believing "that music wasn't a very respectable career for a 
young Southern lady," she said. So in 1974, she moved to Los Angeles and, after 
earning a degree in community clinical psychology from Long Beach State 
University, soon found work as director of a social-services agency in nearby 
Los Alamitos.

For the next decade, Grimes continued to work in the field of social services, 
winning national plaudits for the suicide-prevention hot line she manned for a 
short time on Long Beach radio station KNAC-FM. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the top of my field, going on national speaking tours, lecturing at 
UCLA, getting tons of publicity and making tons of money, and yet I wasn't 
happy," Grimes recalled. "My first love was still music, and I desperately 
wanted to find a way to somehow combine the two -- get back into music without 
giving up my social work." 
</P>
<P>
Grimes eventually found the way in 1987 when she moved south to San Diego and, 
by chance, fell into a lengthy discussion with the manager of a local rock band 
about the lack of cohesiveness on the San Diego music scene. 
</P>
<P>
"We ended up concluding that something needed to be done," Grimes said, "and 
after getting down all the logistics, we came up with this idea of forming some 
sort of organization that would enable me to get back into music while keeping 
me involved with social services; an organization of local musicians interested 
not only in helping themselves, but in helping others. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's exactly what Musicians Who Care has become, particularly since 
(expatriate L.A. musician) Steve Saint signed on as co-coordinator a year ago 
and brought with him years of experience and know-how, both as a musician and 
as a social activist/environmentalist." 
</P>
<P>
Grimes, who is manager of the La Paloma Theater in Encinitas, said there are 
about 35 members in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"They were super when they helped us," said Frances Poe of the San Diego 
Alliance for the Mentally Ill. "They organized a concert at UCSD in May. Our 
main objective was educational, to try to get across the point that mental 
illness is a curable illness, and we not only raised a couple of hundred 
dollars, but we really raised the consciousness of everyone who attended." 
</P>
<P>
The organization has also been involved with the Muscular Dystrophy Assn., the 
Joan Kroc Center for the Homeless and Greenpeace. 
</P>
<P>
In August, on a yet-to-be-determined date, the La Paloma Theater will host a 
benefit concert for Clean Ocean. "We had a literature table at the Encinitas 
Flower Festival this past spring," Grimes said, "and across the way from us 
were the Clean Ocean people. One of our members is a surfer, so he went over 
and started talking to them, and that's how we made the connection." Sharing 
the bill will be three or four local rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
Those appearances fulfill another goal for the membership organization: 
providing notoriety for local bands. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great deal of talent down here that's not being recognized because, 
for one thing, people have the idea that you have to run up to Los Angeles to 
be discovered," said Grimes, who is focusing her energy on the organization and 
is not currently in a band. 
</P>
<P>
"We lose a lot of good musicians because of this perception, and it's 
unfortunate, because what generally happens is that they run up to L.A., they 
don't make it, and they end up working at some place like Burger King." 
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the local scene, the organization is currently sponsoring an 
ongoing "Industry Insider" lecture series. Last Monday evening, nearly 30 local 
musicians, songwriters, managers and assorted hangers-on gathered on the patio 
of the D.G. Wills Bookstore in La Jolla to hear promoter Bill Silva give a 
two-hour rundown on the San Diego concert business. 
</P>
<P>
Silva's talk, in which he touched upon such points as how acts are chosen, how 
local upstarts can get a crack at opening shows for national headliners, and 
what it takes to pull in a good crowd, was followed by another hour of 
networking. Business cards were exchanged, lunch appointments were set, 
contacts were made. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 21, the third "Industry Insider" lecture will take place at a 
yet-to-be-determined location. The speaker will be Lisa Fancher, founder and 
president of independent punk-rock record label Frontier Records. She'll be 
collecting demonstration tapes from local would-be's and discussing "what you 
should and shouldn't do when you're trying to get signed," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime in September, Musicians Who Care will release "The Care," a 
compilation album featuring songs by 10 San Diego original-music bands. The LP 
will be sent to college radio stations throughout the country, Grimes said, 
"and with a little luck, there'll be enough momentum for at least one of these 
songs to get on commercial radio and maybe even become a national hit." 
</P>
<P>
And sometime in October, Musicians Who Care will produce "San Diego Music Expo 
'89." The date and location have not yet been set, but the all-day event will 
consist of various seminars and panel discussions, performances by local bands, 
a rock 'n' roll fashion show, and exhibition booths leased by record companies, 
radio stations and music stores. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that Musicians Who Care will be around forever, long after Steve 
and I are gone," Grimes said. "Ideally, it will be a self-perpetuating thing. 
And with enough musicians expending enough time and energy to fuel it, I'm 
convinced it will be."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS;

<P>
HE DOESN'T CONSIDER HORSE OWNERSHIP A REAL HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

San Diego Union handicapper Jeff Siegel is a rarity, a handicapper who 
occasionally gets to visit the winner's circle as something more than a 
spectator. 
</P>
<P>
As most experienced horse players know, Siegel is an active horse owner, as 
well as a handicapper. Because of his dual role, he often handicaps races that 
include his own horses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it conflicts," Siegel said. "I don't know what I can do to make 
(the horses) run faster." 
</P>
<P>
More than a guy with a small share of one or two horses, Siegel owns all or 
part of 75 thoroughbreds, 35 of which are currently racing. He is also vice 
president of the successful Clover Racing Stables, producer of several stakes 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel never mentions his ownership in the "comment" section of his handicap 
column, although the information is readily available to anybody who reads the 
fine print of the Daily Racing Form. 
</P>
<P>
The main questions that arise from Siegel's ownership revolve around betting 
because the odds are established by the amount of money bet on each horse. In 
theory, Siegel could affect the odds by saying negative things about a horse. 
</P>
<P>
"We have kept an eye" on Siegel, said Bob Wright, the San Diego Union's 
executive sports editor. "The primary concern is, is the handicapper 
undervaluing a horse to allow him to bet on it? We have never seen it happen 
with Jeff." 
</P>
<P>
Siegel is just one of many handicappers and tipsters used by bettors. His may 
be one of the most prominent columns, but bettors are fickle and rarely, as a 
group, rely on any one source of information. 
</P>
<P>
"I can look at a race as objectively as anyone else," said Siegel, who supplies 
handicaps to three other dailies in Southern California, in addition to the 
Union. "I've never seen any evidence that my picks affect the odds." 
</P>
<P>
Among horse players aware of his dual role, Siegel still has the one ingredient 
essential to a handicapper: credibility. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware he owns horses," the Union's Wright said. "If he allowed his 
position as an owner to interfere with his handicapping, he would be cutting 
off his nose to spite his face. He would lose credibility." 
</P>

An hourlong comedy special featuring weatherman Larry Mendte has been put on 
hold by KFMB-TV (Channel 8). The show proposal was sent back to Mendte after 
Channel 8 officials pinpointed areas of "concern," according to program 
director Jules Moreland. A skit called the "Human Weenie Roast" reportedly was 
one of the scenes that made Channel 8 nervous. In a Letterman-like stunt, the 
script called for Mendte, dressed in a flame-resistant suit with hot dogs stuck 
to the outside of it, to walk through fire. . . .

After eight years of exposing the double-dealings of San Diego's rich and 
famous, as "the Inside Story" columnist for the Reader, Paul Krueger is leaving 
the paper. Besides being "completely burned out," Krueger said he is "unhappy 
with the way things have been going in the last year" at the Reader, 
specifically the apparent de-emphasis on hard news. Krueger, also the local 
stringer for Time magazine, expects to take a couple of months off. He doesn't 
rule out working for the Reader in the future, but he has no plans to do the 
column again. . . .

Steve Garvey adds a "thought of the day" to each of his weekday morning shows 
on XTRA-AM (690), perhaps attempting to give the show philosophical punch. It 
needs some sort of spark. The huckling of new sports guy Jimmy (The Saint) 
Christopher is not nearly enough. Given a choice between listening to static 
and listening to Garvey do mutual-admiration interviews with Rolf Benirschke or 
a scout from the Chargers at 7 a.m., static would be slightly more exciting. 
After a month of doing the show, even Garvey sounds like he's about to doze off 
during interviews. Most of the interviews are with jocks who, like Garvey, have 
little to say. Here's a thought of the day: Garvey and Co. is boring radio. . .

More than 50,000 Mozambicans jammed Maputo's National Stadium Sunday for 
British rock artist Eric Clapton and African musicians in a concert coinciding 
with the final day of a congress of the country's ruling party. Clapton, 
heading the bill that included artists from Zaire and South Africa, kept the 
crowd on its feet, taking them through his days with Blind Faith and Derek and 
the Dominoes as police and soldiers in fatigues patrolled the perimeter of the 
stadium. Scores of white South Africans, international aid workers and foreign 
embassy officials also attended the concert, which was a stop on the final leg 
of Clapton's Southern African tour (he already has played in Botswana, Zimbabwe 
and Swaziland). Claudia Puig

CURTAIN RISES ON BROADWAY AIDS DISCRIMINATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SADOWNICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what legal experts see as the first big AIDS discrimination case to hit the 
entertainment industry, a New York State Supreme Court judge has ruled that 
evidence can be presented in choreographer Michael Shawn's $2.75-million suit 
against Broadway producers Marvin Krauss and James M. Nederlander. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn's suit, filed March 1, accuses Krauss and Nederlander of firing Shawn 
unjustly from the short-lived 1988 Broadway musical "Legs Diamond" starring 
Peter Allen. Shawn alleges that they fired him after learning that he had 
tested positive for HIV, the virus believed to cause AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The producers deny that this is an AIDS discrimination case and claim that 
Shawn was fired for failing to live up to his contract. Harvey Fierstein, who 
co-authored "Legs Diamond," said that "it just doesn't make sense that this is 
an AIDS case. Marvin Krauss also produced 'La Cage aux Folles,' and whether 
people were sick or not they worked. There were other reasons besides health 
involved in Michael's being fired. And I worry that if Michael loses, it'll 
hurt legitimate AIDS discrimination cases." 
</P>
<P>
At a pre-trial hearing July 21, Judge Beverly Cohen ruled to allow evidence 
such as depositions, affidavits and letters of evidence to be presented in 
court. In April, the producers' lawyer, Les Fagan, had filed a partial motion 
to dismiss the case. Fagan asked for a summary judgment to prevent the case 
from going to trial. No action has yet been taken on that motion. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether AIDS is going to be treated differently than all other 
disabilities under the discrimination laws -- and whether producers are somehow 
exempt from those laws," said Shawn's attorney, Margaret Winter. She added that 
a trial date "is way off into the future." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it's important to punish James Nederlander and Marvin Krauss, and to 
set precedents that prevent men like this from allowing AIDS hysteria to ruin 
artists' careers," Shawn said last week from his Manhattan apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week's court date provided us, I think, with our first real victory," 
Shawn said. "I think Fagan wants to set a precedent that big-budget musicals 
should be treated differently than other places of employment when it comes to 
AIDS discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Fagan refused to comment, saying that he did not "care to litigate the case in 
the press." He added, however, that "it was nonsense to call this a case of 
AIDS discrimination" and felt "confident that the court would see no basis in 
this charge." 
</P>
<P>
Nederlander could not be reached for comment. (The Nederlander organization, 
the second-largest theater owner on Broadway, operates the Pantages and Greek 
theaters in Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
Shawn, 45, who had worked with Allen before "Legs Diamond," said that he was 
thrilled when Allen asked him to choreograph for the Broadway show. "This was 
my big break," Shawn said. 
</P>
<P>
However, in August, 1988, when auditions were over and much of the choreography 
had been set, Shawn came down with fever and a bad cough. Shawn said that only 
his close associates knew that his roommate had died from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn, who said that he never missed a day of work, took his doctor's advice 
and checked into the hospital for diagnostic tests on Aug. 10. He says that 
preproduction work had already been completed. 
</P>
<P>
According to the March 1 complaint, Krauss called Shawn repeatedly during his 
second day in the hospital, screaming, "This is a $4-million show. I want a 
guarantee that you won't break down before the opening." The next day, the 
complaint claims, Krauss added: "Jimmy Nederlander is on my back to fire you." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, when Shawn learned that his ailment was related to a sinus 
condition that could be cured with antibiotics, his doctor, Sharon Lewin, wrote 
a letter to Krauss saying that her patient was "functioning at full capacity," 
and "could return to work." 
</P>
<P>
But the letter came too late. According to the complaint, Krauss had already 
telephoned Dr. Lewin, who explained that while Shawn was HIV-positive, he was 
"functioning at close to 100% normal capacity and there was no medical reason 
why plaintiff could not perform his job." Within the hour, a letter was 
hand-delivered to Shawn, informing him that he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
(While Shawn was paid his $14,000 fee, his union, the Society of Stage 
Directors and Choreographers, is seeking the royalties his contract specified, 
which could amount to $20,000). 
</P>
<P>
An Aug. 29 letter from the "Legs" attorney to Shawn's union stated that Shawn 
"was not able to complete several scheduled work days and then he was not able 
to work at all." 
</P>
<P>
Shawn said that these allegations are "blatantly false." Mary Rotella, Shawn's 
assistant on the show, confirmed that Shawn had not missed any work days. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn has worked consistently as a choreographer and dance teacher since the 
firing, even though he admits that his health has deteriorated recently. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Karp, who handles the AIDS discrimination cases for the New York City 
Commission on Human Rights, said that while he couldn't confirm whether Shawn's 
case "was the only such one in the entertainment industry," he was certain it 
was the largest. 
</P>
<P>
Karp added that under New York State's Human Rights Law, "it is illegal for 
employers to fire disabled employees -- even if they have AIDS or HIV infection 
-- as long as they can perform their duties in a reasonable manner."

FOOTNOTES: IT USED TO BE GREATER

<TEXT>
<P>
It's official. The Greater Los Angeles Visitors and Convention Bureau is now 
the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
What does all this mean? Not too much, as it turns out. The title was changed 
to be more consistent with other bureaus, the nonprofit tourism and convention 
promoter noted. 
</P>
<P>
"The name change does not reflect any change in marketing thrust or decreased 
interest in promoting and serving members outside the Los Angeles city limits," 
President Bill F. Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Because a new logo is in the works, the bureau has yet to spring for new 
stationery, business cards and the like. Staffers are making do with the old 
stuff or are executing their own redesign with a ballpoint pen.

Pain and Gain for Soviets 
</P>
<P>
First they agree to dismantle missiles. Then they talk about withdrawing troops 
from Europe. And now the Soviets are eager to study aerobics? 
</P>
<P>
It's true. In a nation where for years the only people to "feel the burn" were 
dissident authors as they watched their works go up in the smoke, there is now 
talk -- thanks to glasnost, Reebok and two Los Angeles promoters -- of a drive 
to make aerobics the national participatory sport. Only two months ago, the 
Soviets were first exposed to aerobics with a tour by the Reebok National 
Aerobic Champions, a U.S. team organized by Karen and Howard Schwartz of Los 
Angeles, inventors in 1983 of competitive aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
This week, a Soviet team selected and trained by the Schwartzes is in town -- 
signing up as the 10th member of the International Competitive Aerobic 
Federation and, not incidentally, generating publicity for Reeboks (which 
aren't for sale in the U.S.S.R.). When the team returns home, Howard Schwartz 
says, Soviet officials expect them to train aerobic instructors from Riga to 
Vladivostok, in hopes of whipping the nation's couch pirogi into shape. 
</P>
<P>
Casey Is Still at Bat 
</P>
<P>
Casey Stengel has been dead for 14 years, but he's still pinch-hitting for a 
pinstriped team in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Valley National Bank, a Glendale-based bank that the colorful baseball manager 
and relatives founded in 1957, is running local newspaper advertisements that 
feature Stengel's picture to draw attention to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Valley National recently hired an ad agency that "thought it might be a good 
idea" to highlight the bank's connection with Stengel, especially during the 
baseball season, said bank President Joseph H. Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
Stengel, whose full name was Charles Dillon Stengel, managed the New York 
Yankees to 10 pennants and seven world titles between 1949 and 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Was Stengel's estate paid a royalty for the ad? Declining to take a full swing 
at the question, Valentine said a "token amount" likely was offered, but that 
the estate "probably waived the fee."

LET THE HIRER BEWARE: CASUAL LABOR IS TAXED; 
</P>
<P>
STATE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE CAN BE INCONSISTENT IN ITS ADVICE, SURVEY DISCOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Instead of hiring day laborers who wait on street corners around Los Angeles, 
Val Holwerda, owner of Bristol Press in West Los Angeles, frequently called the 
Santa Monica branch of the California Employment Development Department for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 and 1988, when she first opened the business, Holwerda hired more than 
100 different casual laborers, paying them about $26 a day to move boxes, put 
up shelves, collate papers, sweep floors and perform other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was simpler to do it the right way by calling the state, rather than 
paying people illegally under the table," said Holwerda, a former copywriter 
and publicity director for major department stores. 
</P>
<P>
But, to her surprise, Holwerda now faces a $3,500 to $4,000 tax bill for state 
payroll taxes she was supposed to pay for the day workers. And she is waiting 
to hear from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the federal taxes she may 
owe. 
</P>
<P>
Holwerda is angry because she insists that she asked several different state 
job service workers about the tax ramifications of hiring the casual laborers. 
And, she said, if she had been aware of the need to put each one on the 
payroll, she would have just hired one person instead of several. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told by several Employment Development Department people, 'Just pay them 
in cash -- petty cash -- and as for taxes -- forget it,' " Holwerda recalled. 
"They said these guys are just day workers." 
</P>
<P>
It appears that Holwerda is not the only small-business owner who has been told 
not to worry about paying taxes for casual laborers. A recent informal phone 
survey by The Times found that employers who call EDD branch offices in 
Hollywood, central Los Angeles and other areas are still often told to pay the 
workers in cash and not to worry about taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Several EDD tax auditors said there has been a long-running battle between the 
department's tax and job placement sections over the payroll tax information 
provided to potential employers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the problem has been brought to the attention of the Employment 
Development Department's tax chief. 
</P>
<P>
"I became aware of this issue about a month ago and took steps to communicate 
with the operations branch," said Karl Grossenbacher, EDD's deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
Grossenbacher said the department is preparing a memo to job service staff 
members reminding them that they should refer all questions about payroll taxes 
to the tax division and not provide any tax information themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Grossenbacher said employers with questions should feel free to call the tax 
offices and get the correct information, even if they prefer to remain 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"Our general theory is most employers want to do it right, because they don't 
want the hassles of doing it wrong," Grossenbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Misinformed 
</P>
<P>
He said employers do not have to pay payroll taxes if they pay someone less 
than $50 in one three-month period to do something unrelated to their business 
purpose. For example, a shop owner who hires a man to wash the shop windows on 
a one-time basis would not be responsible for payroll taxes. Most other 
arrangements between an employer and an employee require paying taxes to cover 
disability insurance, unemployment insurance, employment training fund expenses 
and personal income tax withholding. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Camarillo, supervisor of the employment tax division in the Santa 
Monica branch office, said he is "aware of inconsistencies" in the tax 
information being provided to employers by the job placement workers in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Although he declined to discuss the specifics of Holwerda's case, he said many 
small-business owners are misinformed about state payroll tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the employer community goes to the wrong source for tax information," 
said Camarillo. "If they talk to the wrong person, they will get the wrong 
information." 
</P>
<P>
He said employers believe that it is "completely burdensome" to put people on 
the payroll who work only one or two days, but nonetheless the law makes the 
employer ultimately responsible for paying the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
That explanation, however, doesn't diminish Holwerda's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Several calls to EDD labor desks in various locations revealed a lack of 
consistency. One day last week, the person answering the phone on the labor 
desk at the Central Los Angeles branch said employers usually pay the day 
workers in cash. When asked specifically if employers were responsible for 
payroll taxes, he said: "No, no, you don't have to pay any taxes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Instructed Not to Give Advice 
</P>
<P>
A supervisor in the Hollywood branch said employers are not responsible for the 
payroll taxes "if you tell them you are hiring them as an independent 
contractor." But that isn't accurate, according to state tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
A woman answering the phone at the South Gate branch said it did not matter how 
the day workers were paid. She suggested calling the state labor commission or 
employment tax division for information. "I would hate to give you the wrong 
information," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The EDD job service workers are instructed not to provide any tax information 
because it is beyond their scope of training, said Suzanne Schroeder, EDD 
spokeswoman in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, because the people like to be paid in cash, an employer might think 
that means you don't have to pay taxes," Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
Although casual laborers are those who do not work more than three days at any 
one job, they are handled just like any other job-seeker, Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year ended June 30, Schroeder said, the department placed 41,369 
individuals in jobs lasting three days or less. That compares to the 246,793 
individuals placed in non-agricultural jobs during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Like many small-business owners starting out, Bristol Press owner Holwerda said 
she relied on casual laborers when she couldn't afford to hire full-time help. 
</P>
<P>
She paid them all by check and kept track of every expense. When she asked her 
accountant about the tax implications, he told her that she didn't have to file 
tax forms until the amount reached $600. However, she later learned that the 
rule is a federal one applicable only to independent contractors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prefers Agencies Now 
</P>
<P>
Holwerda's tax audit was triggered when she decided to cut back on the work of 
a free-lance artist she was using regularly. The artist filed for unemployment 
insurance benefits, claiming that she was a Bristol Press employee. When state 
officials researched the claim, they found that Holwerda had not been paying 
payroll taxes for the woman because Holwerda considered the artist to be an 
independent contractor with a separate business. 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, Holwerda said she wishes that she had never hired any casual 
laborers or independent contractors. She now relies on outside vendors or 
workers supplied by temporary agencies if she needs extra help.

ASIAN RADIO IS A HARD SELL FOR ADS, BROADCASTERS FIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

An independent Chinese-American programming company working for KAZN-AM had 
lobbied hard to get a Los Angeles nightclub to advertise on the radio station's 
Chinese show. So the firm was stunned recently when a rival KAZN programmer 
persuaded the club to buy time on KAZN's Korean segment instead. 
</P>
<P>
"They were ready to sign up with us . . . but those Korean (American) salesmen 
are quite aggressive," said William Parker, a station employee and head of the 
independent company that programs KAZN's Chinese segment. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Byungwoo Kim, who heads the company that provides Korean programming on 
KAZN, said he did not recall the incident. But he admitted that there has been 
friction at the station among the various ethnic groups. He accused salesmen 
for KAZN's Chinese show of encroaching on other sales territories because "they 
don't have any big business in the Chinese community" to support their 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
Selling a unified Asian-American market of consumers to advertisers has proved 
problematic for KAZN -- the nation's only all-Asian language station. 
</P>
<P>
Since it went on the air in January, KAZN has tried to market six diverse Asian 
languages and cultures -- Japanese, Korean, Thai, Filipino, Chinese and 
Vietnamese -- to companies eager to reach the 2.7 million Asian-Americans 
living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Although the owners say the station is profitable, it has encountered 
resistance from some major advertisers, and neither station owners nor Arbitron 
Ratings Co. can provide estimates of how many listeners the station has. In 
addition, KAZN has experienced friction among its independent Asian-American 
producers. Meanwhile, there is concern among some experts that as Asians 
assimilate into U.S. society, they will lose the language skills and culture 
that define them as a unique market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affluent Groups 
</P>
<P>
"This is a conceptual sell, not a marketing sell," said Dwight Case, chief 
executive and co-founder of the 5,000-watt station in Pasadena. "One thing we 
know is that we are not going to have (big) ratings. We have to sell 
advertisers on the concept" of a unified Asian-American market. 
</P>
<P>
Visions of such a market have long intrigued entrepreneurs interested in 
reaching what are some of the most affluent and highly educated ethnic groups 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, 60% of all Japanese- and Korean-American households 
earn $30,000 or more, reported a study released in June by Los Angeles 
television station KSCI. And Filipino-Americans, though from a poor country, 
had the highest average annual income of all Asian ethnic groups in Los Angeles 
County, according to a United Way study of 1980 census data. Japanese-Americans 
placed second in the study. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated in 1987 that the national 
average annual household income for Latinos is $24,666 and $20,743 for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Asian-Americans are a "tremendously promising market but 90% of the major 
advertisers aren't ready for them," said David Chen, executive vice president 
of the Los Angeles advertising agency Muse Cordero Chen, Inc. "When (most) 
people refer to Asian people, they think of Buddhist temples and Confucian 
thought, but things are more complicated than that." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Case, 60, and KAZN co-founder George Fritzinger, spent nearly five 
years studying the market before they launched KAZN in January. The pair had 
been watching the economic development of fast-growing Pacific Rim countries 
such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan and were convinced that mainstream 
advertisers were not catering to the burgeoning Asian-American population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rates Are Cheaper 
</P>
<P>
To hedge their bets, however, the owners lease KAZN's 19 hours of daily air 
time to independent programmers and sell commercial spots to advertisers. 
Prices for air time range from $250 to $1,000 an hour, depending on how much 
commercial time a programmer wants to sell. 
</P>
<P>
A 60-second commercial at KAZN sells for $100 to $200, station officials said. 
By comparison, the average cost of a 60-second commercial at Southern 
California's 200-odd radio stations is about $450, according to the Southern 
California Broadcasters Assn., a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
The mix of music, news and information that KAZN broadcasts has proved to be a 
big hit with some advertisers, especially on the Korean and Japanese shows. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more than 150 advertisers," declared Kim, a former Seoul, South Korea, 
broadcaster who heads the 22-member production company that provides 10 hours 
of daily Korean language programming on KAZN. "This is a good business." 
</P>
<P>
Mayumi Shirai, president of Asahi Homecast, which produces Japanese language 
programming for KAZN, said there is already a waiting list of Japanese banks, 
brokerage firms, travel agencies and food companies trying to buy time on the 
two-hour show. 
</P>
<P>
But for others at the station, broadcasting has not been so rosy. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, for instance, Case canceled Dragon Broadcasting Co.'s two-hour 
Chinese language show after the company fell $20,000 in debt to the station. 
Dragon was unable to sell a sufficient number of ads on the show. 
</P>
<P>
Case, who is searching for replacement Chinese programming, blames Dragon's 
lack of experience in sales and marketing. But Parker, who heads the company 
and has worked as a broadcaster in Hong Kong and Tokyo, said even Case's sales 
staff was unable to sell all the commercial slots for the show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Have Faltered 
</P>
<P>
Despite some advertiser resistance, a few large retailers such as May Co. and 
the Broadway department stores as well as Korean Airlines and the Los Angeles 
Police Department, among others, have bought commercial time on KAZN. And Case 
says there is even greater demand from smaller concerns such as beauty salons, 
restaurants, grocery stores and travel agencies, although he said he's been 
disappointed that specialty food concerns and the telephone company have not 
been heavy advertisers, as he expected. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, several California-based publications and broadcast outlets 
have cropped up to serve Asian-Americans, including KSCI and Radio Pacific 
Japan in Gardena. But while KSCI, Channel 18, has had a measure of success 
serving Asian-Americans and several other ethnic groups, some media enterprises 
that have targeted the Asian-American community have faltered. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Rice magazine, a Los Angeles-based publication that targeted 
second- and third-generation Asian-American readers, folded this year, and 
broadcasters such as Radio Pacific Japan of KMAX-FM, report having financial 
difficulty because Asian companies seem comfortable with their existing 
advertising relationships and U.S. advertisers feel that they can reach 
Asian-Americans through mainstream publications. 
</P>
<P>
"The radio business is a very difficult business because the audience (that 
speaks Japanese) is very small," said Yoshioki Mizuno, president of Radio 
Pacific Japan. Mizuno, who spoke through an interpreter, estimates that only 
about 63,000 Japanese-Americans in Southern California tune into the one-hour 
evening show. 
</P>
<P>
Fred McLaren, president of Hughes Market, which the KSCI survey found was the 
second most popular supermarket among Japanese-Americans in Southern California 
behind Vons, said the chain's popularity among Japanese-Americans "is more a 
function of our location than anything else." He said that while Hughes used to 
advertise some years ago on a Japanese-language television program it doesn't 
any longer because the Japanese-American community in Los Angeles is made up of 
"mostly second- and third-generation" residents. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in native language skills concerns many who target the 
Asian-American community. While the native language skills of some groups, such 
as Koreans and Filipinos, are replenished by the influx of many newcomers to 
the United States, acculturation has eroded the language skills of other 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
KSCI's study found that while 94% of Korean-Americans said they planned to 
teach their children to speak Korean, less than two-thirds of 
Japanese-Americans surveyed in Southern California indicated that they would 
teach their children to speak Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the changing foreign language fluency of his audience, Case is 
optimistic over KAZN's long-term outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Case, who said he hopes to expand to round-the-clock broadcasting beginning in 
August, notes that Spanish broadcasters also initially encountered advertiser 
reluctance until they persuaded advertisers to ignore broadcast ratings and 
focus more on the overall demographic characteristics of the Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, you couldn't market a Spanish-language station either," Case 
observed, "but look at where the Spanish market is now."

MAXICARE AIMS TO BE IN SHAPE BEFORE SIGN-UP; 
</P>
<P>
PUSHES PLAN IN HOPES OF SHEDDING CH. 11 MANTLE BY JANUARY ENROLLMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Maxicare Health Plans Inc., which is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code, is attempting to push through a reorganization plan before 
January, when most employers will allow their workers to switch health 
insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Los Angeles-based health maintenance organization has lost 
significant membership and is moving with unusual speed in producing a proposal 
for negotiating a final plan to be approved by the bankruptcy court. "This is 
remarkable progress," said Lee Waltzer, an analyst with R. D. Smith &amp; Co. 
in New York. He said Maxicare appears to be concerned about the marketing 
disadvantage of operating under Chapter 11 during open enrollment season. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts see the proposal, which Maxicare earlier this week submitted to 
creditors for comment, as the company's first marketing move for the fall. 
Maxicare acknowledged Friday that its membership has shrunk to about 440,000, 
from about 900,000 when it made the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Claims Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the losses have been in Illinois and California, which were two of our 
strongest plans. We are looking at marketing this fall to be very important," a 
Maxicare spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare got a boost Friday when the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana again 
dismissed state regulator claims that federal law prohibited Maxicare units in 
certain states from filing under Chapter 11 because they operated as insurance 
companies. The ruling was expected, given a June decision in which the court 
ruled that HMOs are eligible for bankruptcy relief because Congress did not 
specifically exclude them in writing the 1978 bankruptcy code. Friday's ruling 
was on motions filed by Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, similar to the June motions 
filed by three other states. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare had feared that rulings favorable to the states would result in states 
taking control of the plans and liquidating them to pay creditor claims. 
</P>
<P>
Creditors said Friday that they were encouraged that Maxicare has at least made 
a proposal. The official creditors committee is "pleased" that Maxicare has 
stated the terms for an economic settlement for satisfying the debts, said 
David A. Gill, counsel for providers and other creditors excluding bond holders 
and the banks. Gill wouldn't comment on creditor reaction to specifics of the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a good starting point," said Dr. Rafael A. Amaro, president of 
Hawthorne Community Medical Group, a medical provider owed substantial sums by 
Maxicare. Amaro said providers are particularly encouraged by Maxicare's stated 
intent to give "favored treatment" to the claims of health-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
Amaro said he believes that the providers will be cooperative in negotiating a 
final plan. "The providers I speak to would like to have Maxicare stabilized. I 
believe it doesn't do anyone in the industry any good not to have Maxicare 
survive," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Street, managing director of Seidler Amdec Securities' Reorganized 
Securities Group, said Maxicare has shown some favorable trends since the 
bankruptcy filing. The group is a holder of some Maxicare bonds. Seidler 
Amdec's most recent report on Maxicare pointed to considerable cash the company 
has been able to generate since the bankruptcy filing and a decline in its 
medical expense ratio (medical cost as a percent of revenue) to 85% vs. 92% in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the improvement is because of a rate increase averaging 32% in 1989, 
the report said. The company is expected to boost rates at least 15% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Maxicare spokesman said the company had generated $55.6 million in 
unrestricted cash as June 30, up from $6.6 million in cash in March.

2 'PUDDLE-JUMPERS' MAKE IT TO THE ALTAR; 
</P>
<P>
PIEDMONT AIRLINES' LOGO TO DISAPPEAR AS IT FINALLY JOINS USAIR 
</P>

<P>
After a long engagement between two original puddle-jumpers, one of the biggest 
airline marriages will take place this Saturday, when Piedmont Airlines assumes 
the name of suitor USAir Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The union will create an airline that employs more than 48,000 people operating 
a fleet of 426 jets in 36 states, two Canadian provinces, the Bahamas and 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Figures compiled by the Air Transport Assn. in Washington show the combined 
operations would rank USAir as the seventh largest in terms of capacity. The 
two airlines flew more than 59 million passengers last year. 
</P>
<P>
The courtship between USAir and Piedmont was brief and expensive, and came at a 
time the airline market was becoming carnivorous. USAir bought Piedmont for 
$1.59 billion cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Piedmont folks expected people would have to spend a heck of a lot of money," 
said Dan Brock, vice president of marketing services for USAir and former 
senior vice president of marketing for Piedmont. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a strong feeling of self worth," he said. "We knew we were good, and 
we wanted to be good. I don't think it surprised anybody that we went for such 
a big price." 
</P>
<P>
The USAir-Piedmont merger reflected a broad move throughout the deregulated 
airline industry to gain strength through size. Delta Airlines bought Western 
Airlines, Texas Air acquired People Express and Eastern, Northwest Airlines 
bought Republic Airlines and Trans World Airlines bought Ozark Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
TWA had also wanted to buy USAir, making the Piedmont purchase more important 
to USAir's struggle to retain its identity. 
</P>
<P>
Piedmont employees are expected to miss their own identity, established by the 
company 41 years ago when it began flying out of Winston-Salem with small, 
noisy prop planes. But Brock said Piedmont isn't moving into hostile territory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birds of a Feather 
</P>
<P>
"It is a marriage to a partner who is so similar to us," Brock said. "We have 
had to struggle. So have they. We began with a role of flying from small cities 
to big cities, and USAir was much the same. We were lucky to be acquired by 
someone so much like us." 
</P>
<P>
"Employees felt a sense of loss, from the sense that (Piedmont) was more than 
just a company," he said. "The company was, and in a sense still is, a family." 
</P>
<P>
The employees have had 2 1/2 years to adjust to the idea of merging with USAir, 
which is headquartered near Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"(Company officials) didn't want to rush into the merger," Brock said. "They 
wanted to plan it out, get the issues behind us, and know where we were going." 
</P>
<P>
At a hangar at the Smith-Reynolds Airport in Winston-Salem, workers who wore 
Piedmont patches toiled in the weeks before the merger to remove the Piedmont 
name from jets and replace it with the red and blue USAir logo. 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday, Piedmont's logo will be history. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, when deregulation of the airline industry began, the logo represented 
one of only a few airlines serving the small Southeastern towns that other 
carriers decided to skip. Piedmont's main competition was USAir. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than leave these small towns, both airlines chose to branch out and fly 
elsewhere as well, as deregulation allowed them to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Our job had been to feed these people to other airlines in major cities," 
Brock said. "With deregulation, we could start trying to feed ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Merger talks began as early as 1986, when Piedmont Chairman William Howard held 
the first of several discussions with USAir Chairman Edward Colodny. Later, the 
bids began coming. Norfolk-Southern Corp., in February, 1987, offered $1.49 
billion, or $65 a share, for Piedmont. The Norfolk, Va.-based transportation 
company already owned 19.5% of Piedmont's stock. 
</P>
<P>
USAir offered $71 a share, with half the 23 million outstanding common shares 
to be purchased in cash and the rest exchanged for USAir stock. 
</P>
<P>
Piedmont wanted cash, USAir wanted Piedmont, so USAir came back with an 
all-cash agreement of $69 a share. Piedmont accepted the deal in March, 1987. 
The U.S. Transportation Department approved it half a year later, and the 
planning for a smooth merger has been under way since.

JAPANESE FIRMS TRY TO EASE TRADE TENSIONS

<P>
Japan's business leaders, apparently alarmed by the paralysis gripping their 
national government, are starting to take measures on their own aimed at easing 
trade problems with the United States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Keidanren, the powerful federation of economic organizations, decided last 
week to set up its own agency to help foreign executives experiencing 
difficulties in exporting goods to Japan. Meanwhile, major manufacturing 
companies are stepping up their own importing efforts in a bid to ease trade 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Japanese business leaders have counted on government bureaucrats 
to handle trade problems and fend off complaints from foreign competitors about 
unfair trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
However, as the country's trade surpluses have persisted despite the 
revaluation of the yen, it has become more difficult for the bureaucrats to 
satisfy foreigners. Also, the deterioration of Japan's political leadership in 
recent months has left the bureaucracy uncertain about the direction of trade 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are concerned, for example, about how to handle forthcoming 
negotiations with the United States on structural barriers to trade. In the 
current political climate, with parties trying harder than ever to appeal to 
public opinion, no one is prepared to make concessions on sensitive issues such 
as trading practices. 
</P>
<P>
At a Keidanren seminar near Tokyo last Thursday, Akio Morita, chairman of Sony 
and a vice chairman of Keidanren, noted that many foreign businessmen claimed 
that nothing was done about complaints that they made to the government-run 
Office of the Trade Ombudsman. The OTO, set up in 1982, has handled only 370 
cases to date, and only one-third of them have led to any action. 
</P>
<P>
The Keidanren accepted Morita's suggestion that their own complaints body be 
set up and that advertisements be placed in major U.S. magazines to publicize 
its existence. 
</P>
<P>
Among other signs of business concern about trade friction, a number of large 
companies are stepping up their importing efforts and avoiding any increase in 
exports, despite the yen's recent weakening trend. For example, exports of 
motor vehicles fell 0.1% in the first half of 1989 to 3.06 million, according 
to figures published last week by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Matsushita Electric Industrial, the giant consumer and industrial 
electronics group, said earlier this month that it would double its imports of 
parts and manufactured goods to $2.8 billion by 1993.

<P>
Private-sector banks, spooked by China's ruthless suppression of a 
pro-democracy movement, are showing reluctance to finance Hong Kong's ambitious 
plans for a second airport without government guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has come to rely on the private sector to develop most of the 
colony's infrastructure, but since the early 1980s it has stopped guaranteeing 
the financing of such projects, leaving the risk to investors. But financial 
sources said bankers would be unwilling to accept such conditions in the case 
of a new airport. "The situation is completely different," a European banker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if work on a new airport started next month, it would not be completed 
until after 1997, when China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong. Government 
officials in recent weeks have been pushing the project to bankers as a key 
part of Hong Kong's economic development and a major boost to investor 
confidence.

MEMO: IN THE CLOSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Companies in the closet business are finding a growing market overseas, where 
they occasionally get hung up on language problems. 
</P>
<P>
Clairson International in Ocala, Fla., for years has been manufacturing the 
Closet Maid brand of organizers, made of coated steel rods and wire and sold in 
30 countries. But when the company began marketing its product in England, a 
name change was in order. To the British, after all, closet means bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
"In England, we use Clairson Organizers," said Judith Miley, a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
California Closet Co. of Woodland Hills plans to enter the British market soon 
as California Wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
In other overseas dealings, California Closet a year and a half ago sold a 
master franchise to a Tokyo-based company called Daido Worsted Mills that is 
establishing franchises throughout densely populated Japan, where storage space 
-- or any space -- is at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
When California Closet executives first learned that they would be meeting with 
Daido representatives to explain the business, they took courses in Japanese 
culture and learned, among other things, to bow when being introduced. The 
Japanese, meanwhile, were brushing up on U.S. customs, such as shaking hands. 
</P>
<P>
When they met at Los Angeles International Airport, both sides tried to 
practice their newly mastered skills, with amusing results. "We were quite a 
group," said Mike Pedersen, California Closet's director of franchise 
development. 
</P>
<P>
During frequent trips to Europe, Charles E. Williams, the 73-year-old founder 
of kitchen outfitter Williams-Sonoma, would see clever household storage and 
organization items that he simply couldn't squeeze into his company's catalogue 
for cooks. So he started another mail order brochure, called Hold Everything, 
filled with items designed to bring order to chaos -- ranging from personal 
diaries to hat boxes to umbrella stands to wine racks to custom-cut cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1983. In 1985, the success of that catalogue spawned a retail chain 
of so-called container stores. The firm now has six Hold Everything outlets and 
plans to open five more by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Hold Everything strike such a responsive chord? "People have so many 
things," said Anne Kupper, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based 
Williams-Sonoma. "They need things to put their things in." 
</P>
<P>
For the do-it-yourself set, bookstores carry an array of volumes on home 
remodeling, including some that deal specifically with how to make the most of 
storage space. 
</P>
<P>
Hold Everything in Century City Shopping Center sells "Closets: Designing and 
Organizing the Personalized Closet," by Patricia Coen and Bryan Milford 
(Michael Friedman Publishing Group, New York: $12.95), and "Storage: Great 
Ideas for Closets, Kitchens, Kids' Rooms, Bathrooms, and Every Room in the 
House" (HP Books, a division of Price Stern Sloan, Los Angeles: $9.95). 
</P>
<P>
Both list sources for storage products and services that can help clients get 
organized. MARTHA GROVES

MURPHY BED COMPANY ISN'T FOLDING UP YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to California closet companies, Murphy Door Bed Co. just might be 
the original. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer of one of the earliest space-saving devices -- the 
fold-into-the-wall Murphy bed -- was founded by William Lawrence Murphy about 
1900 in San Francisco under the name Murphy Wall Bed Co. of California Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Murphy's grandson, Clark W. Murphy, is president of the company, which 
decades ago moved cross-country to Amityville, N.Y., and adopted the new name. 
</P>
<P>
The company still has strong California ties. In El Monte, it manufactures 
space-saving kitchens, like those found in motel rooms, under the Cervitor 
name. San Diego is headquarters for a five-store Southern California retail 
chain called Murphy Beds &amp; Custom Cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
Business is a little on the slow side, Murphy acknowledged, because of weakness 
in construction and furniture sales. But the company still sells about 5,000 
Murphy beds a year. 
</P>
<P>
Its No. 2 market is Southern California, "where real estate is no bargain" and 
customers want their guest rooms to double as offices or sewing rooms, Murphy 
said. Los Angeles-area customers often spend $2,000 or more to outfit rooms 
with Murphy beds that are incorporated into wall systems including bookshelves 
and drawers. (The leading market, of course, is New York City, with its 
thousands of dinky studio apartments.) 
</P>
<P>
Until about 1917, Murphy said, most such space-saving beds folded into walls. 
But in that year, his grandfather's company received a patent for a bed that 
folded up into a closet. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled that any bed 
that folds into a closet can be called a Murphy bed, meaning that Murphy Door 
Bed no longer has exclusive rights to the name. But the court also upheld a 
ruling of unfair competition against Interior Sleep Systems Inc., which did 
business in Florida and Georgia as Murphy Bed Co. of America Inc. The court 
said the company could not call its own wall beds "originals." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said he has spent "several hundred thousand dollars" over the past eight 
years trying to protect the name and plans somehow to continue the fight. 
Meanwhile, he wonders whether he will ever see the more than $800,000 in 
damages that Interior has been ordered to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision really hasn't affected business," he maintained, adding 
emphatically: "We still are the genuine, original Murphy bed." MARTHA GROVES

FANS HOPE 3RD TIME A CHARM FOR 2-TIME NO-SHOW STEWART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the third time is, indeed, the charm, local Rod Stewart fans just might be 
in luck. 
</P>
<P>
The British rock singer bowed out of his scheduled appearance at the San Diego 
Sports Arena Friday due to truck failure, then was rebooked Saturday and failed 
to show again because of a throat ailment. He has been booked into the arena 
Tuesday for what promoter Bill Silva hopes is the third, and last, time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really disappointed that Rod's fans have had to go through such a 
tremendous amount of hassle," Silva said. "Rod is a consummate professional, 
and Saturday night, he didn't want to give his fans anything less than a great 
show, which would have happened had he tried to perform anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"And Friday night, it was was just one of those things that happens once in 150 
shows: mechanical failure leading to the postponement of a concert." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saga Began With Phone Call 
</P>
<P>
The frustrating saga, both to Silva and Stewart's fans, began shortly after 
midnight on Friday with a phone call Silva received in his car. 
</P>
<P>
"I picked up the phone and on the other end was Rod's manager, who had just 
been informed that they (Stewart's road crew) were having a problem with one of 
the trucks leaving the Fresno show (Thursday night) and that they were unsure 
how long it would take to resolve," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
"In any event, they felt that the production (set-up in San Diego) would be 
sufficiently delayed to warrant considering moving the show from that night to 
the next (Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
"So I immediately woke up the Sports Arena manager at home and secured the 
building for Saturday night, and then put everything in gear to move the show 
-- this included notifying all the stagehands, security guards, caterers, and 
other production personnel -- by making a string of phone calls, all between 
12:15 and 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Radio stations all jumped on it and gave us assistance in notifying fans of 
the move, and on Saturday, we were off and running. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Stewart wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trouble Brewed Again 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday night, the show was completely in place, and it wasn't until we got a 
phone call from Rod's assistant at his hotel room sometime around 8 p.m. that 
we knew there was trouble brewing again," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod has this daily ritual when he's on the road that culminates with a vocal 
warm-up in which he plays a tape and sings along to it. The warm-up usually 
starts around 6 p.m., a couple of hours before the show, and allows him to 
loosen up his vocal chords in the event that they're tight and thus work out 
any potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday, however, proved to be one of the rare instances in which the warm-up 
didn't help him and, in fact, made his throat even worse. Rod's manager called 
him back and urged him to continue trying to work out the problems, but the 
situation failed to improve and at 8:30 they finally decided to cancel." 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Silva said, most of the sold-out crowd of more than 11,000 was 
already seated. He felt bad, he said, and so, apparently, did Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"So we immediately came up with a new date, Tuesday," Silva said. "We made the 
announcement, told the audience that anyone who couldn't make it Tuesday was 
entitled to a refund, and that parking would be free that night -- Rod felt so 
bad that he insisted on paying everyone's parking." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart is also paying for all the production costs for the Tuesday show that 
Silva originally incurred on Saturday, the promoter said. 
</P>
<P>
"Had he played Saturday, he would have made more than $100,000," Silva said. 
"But tomorrow (Tuesday) night, he'll be lucky to walk away with $30,000 or even 
$20,000, because we have to pay all the expenses in putting on the show a 
second time and this time, it's coming from Rod." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hamel had made plans to attend Friday's concert and his friends had even 
hired a limousine. After learning that the concert was postponed, Hamel said, 
"I was bummed." 
</P>
<P>
How did he feel Saturday night when he actually went to the arena and, half an 
hour after taking his seat, learned that Stewart was a no-show again?: "Really 
bummed." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think he was sexy and didn't want his body," Hamel said, in a spoof 
of one of Stewart's songs. "People were cursing, they were so mad.

BRUSH FIRE SKIRTS AFFLUENT SAND CANYON AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing atop a hill in the calm of dusk, surveying the blackened hills around 
Mountain Park Road, Dave and Macel Barron reflected on their good fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Their prized rose bushes were burned, the chicken coop consumed, and their 
steel tool shed melted. But their home in an affluent Sand Canyon neighborhood 
escaped unscathed from a fast-moving brush fire that consumed more than 1,100 
acres in the Santa Clarita Valley and was still burning out of control late 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
From their vantage point the Barrons, both 46, could see helicopters dropping 
water onto hot spots glowing in the distance, but Los Angeles County fire 
officials said all homes were out of danger and that they expected the blaze to 
be contained by 6 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lost Shed' 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a tool shed, the fence and the chicken coop, but the house could have 
been like that," Dave Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the closest that any fire has ever gotten to our house," Macel Barron 
said, as she snapped photos of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Although flames came perilously close to at least six homes on Mountain Park 
Road, the Barrons' tool shed and chicken coop were the only structures lost in 
the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The calm of dusk was a stark contrast to the commotion of midday, when Sand 
Canyon residents and firefighters rallied to save the expensive homes. As a 
dozen firefighters stood in the Barrons' back yard battling the blaze, Dave 
Barron ran through the house, gathering photo albums and other possessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooperation Noted 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Sand Canyon area, horse owners worked to evacuate the many 
horses that live on the canyon's ranches. As flames raced within 200 yards of 
the Arabian Pleasure Horse Ranch, six horse owners led the 22 animals stabled 
there to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"They got kind of nervous but they were pretty eager to jump in the trailers 
and get out of here," said Don DeGroote, of Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of several homes on Warmuth Road took their animals to neighboring 
homes and ranches. Members of the Arabian Horse Society sent trailers to help 
transport horses out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people were urged to leave homes that were threatened by flames. 
But most chose to stay and protect their luxury Tudor- and ranch-style homes. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Van Horn, of Newhall, whose in-laws live on Red Clay Street, said that 
"everyone chipped in to take care of each other. . . . That's the way the 
canyon is, everybody knows everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the driveway of his home off Pacy Street, Floyd Irvin, 49, said he 
would not move from the area. 
</P>
<P>
"They have fires every year out here. You go through this two or three times 
every summer for nine years, you don't get too excited," said Irvin as his 
front-lawn sprinklers ran full blast. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't lost a house here in 15 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita City Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon, who lives in a 
two-story, Spanish-style home on Raven Hill Road, said he has lived in the area 
for 20 years and this is the closest that a brush fire has come from his home. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that impressed me is what a great job the Fire Department did and 
how the neighbors worked to help each other," he said. "When you go through 
something like this, it's just great to see how people rally around to help 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon was backing out of his driveway when he noticed the fire in the hills 
near his home. He said he went back inside, changed clothes and then went out 
to help his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Gunnison, 33, a four-year resident of the Ravenhill Street area, said that 
although she and her husband did not want to leave their home, they took their 
12 Arabian horses, several goats and dogs to nearby stables. 
</P>
<P>
However, deputies attempted to arrest her husband, Gunnison said, as he 
returned to their house with the empty horse trailer. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 1,100 acres of brush consumed by late Sunday had not burned in 
more than 40 years, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire burned all the way to the pavement of the Antelope Valley Freeway 
north of the Via Princessa exit. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway traffic was slowed in both directions for more than two hours, and the 
freeway was closed briefly about 7 p.m. Thick, white smoke billowed across all 
the traffic lanes, reducing visibility to about 200 feet. Some motorists 
stopped on the shoulder to watch the flames. A few produced video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backfires Set 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters set backfires to contain the blaze and helicopters and air tankers 
conducted water drops at the freeway's edge. More than 350 firefighters battled 
the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
At about 11 p.m., county Fire Department Spokesman Corey Lovers said that the 
fire was about 60% contained and that all homes were out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
The only injury reported by Sunday evening was a sprained ankle suffered by a 
prison inmate working on a fire crew.

OLD NUCLEAR DUMP OFF COAST IS A RELIC OF ERA OF NAIVETE IN TOXIC DISPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the black depths of the ocean near the Channel Islands lies a largely 
forgotten memento of the early nuclear age. It is low-level radioactive waste 
generated at Rockwell International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory and Canoga 
Park plants. 
</P>
<P>
For about a decade starting in the early 1950s, Atomics International, later 
part of Rockwell, dumped hundreds of drums of radioactive waste in 6,000 feet 
of water south of Santa Cruz Island. 
</P>
<P>
Today, precise information on the dump is hard to come by. Old U.S. government 
reports estimate that the dump received about 3,100 drums of waste containing 
108 curies of radioactivity -- apparently not a great concentration considering 
the diluting power of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not known if these numbers are accurate, or if all the dumping was 
recorded. Neither is it certain whether other government contractors disposed 
of waste at the site. Except for a limited survey in 1960, there has been no 
environmental monitoring of the Santa Cruz site by Rockwell or government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Specific Studies 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, there have been no specific studies directed at that 
particular site to find out exactly what has been dumped there," said Diane 
Green, a park naturalist with Channel Islands National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The Park Service . . . does have concerns for that site as well as any other 
toxic dumping site," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Larger radioactive dumps used during the same years have been studied, 
specifically those near the Farallon Islands off San Francisco and in the 
Atlantic Ocean. Although elevated radioactivity was found in bottom sediment 
near these dumps, no significant levels were found in samples of fish. Most 
researchers have concluded that too little radioactive material was dumped off 
the U.S. coasts during the '40s, '50s and '60s to create a human health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The dumping was more of a dangerous precedent than a life-threatening event, 
said W. Jackson Davis, professor of biology at UC Santa Cruz and a leading 
critic of ocean disposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Waste 
</P>
<P>
However, the dump may also be a special case because radioactive waste was not 
the only thing disposed of near Santa Cruz, the largest island in Channel 
Islands National Park. When Atomics International began the dumping, the Navy 
was already using the site to dispose of military waste. In fact, official 
nautical charts describe the site as a former "chemical munitions dumping area" 
-- saying nothing about radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
The radioactive waste dumping, authorized by the old U.S. Atomic Energy 
Commission, was variously estimated by Rockwell officials to have stopped 
between 1959 and 1962, when commercial land burial sites became available for 
low-level wastes generated at the Canoga Park plants and the Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"The ocean is awfully big," and ocean dumping was considered "a perfectly 
acceptable way to dispose of radioactive waste," said Marlin Remley, former 
chief of nuclear safety and licensing at Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, 
successor to Atomics International. "I don't know when it was decided that, 
'Hey, this is no good.' " 
</P>
<P>
Atomics International dumped low-level material, including liquids, 
contaminated wipes, gloves, glassware and other equipment. But the refuse 
included some highly dangerous plutonium, according to a paper delivered by 
company officials at an AEC symposium in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Atomics International began the ocean dumping before moving to its plant at 
6633 Canoga Ave. at the end of 1955. Previously it disposed of waste from 
experiments at its plant in Downey, where the firm operated California's first 
nuclear power reactor, a tiny test model, starting in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Although radioactive dumping by the United States virtually ended in 1962, it 
surfaced as a major environmental issue years later, leading to congressional 
hearings in 1976 and later. 
</P>
<P>
According to information compiled at the time, at least 27 Pacific, Atlantic 
and Gulf Coast sites were designated for low-level wastes, but the waste dumped 
near the Farallons and at three Atlantic Coast sites far exceeded the volume at 
all other sites combined. Virtually all environmental monitoring by the 
Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations has been done at these 
larger sites. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have found measurable radioactivity at each of the sites, but "we 
didn't find any significant uptake of radioactive materials in any of the fish 
we sampled," said Bob Dyer, chief of environmental studies for the EPA office 
of radiation programs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food Chain 
</P>
<P>
Similar conclusions have been reached by contract researchers for the 
California Department of Health Services, who have gathered fish samples near 
the Farallon Islands during the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the key thing you want to know," Dyer said. "You want to know whether 
it's going up the food chain and getting into man, and there's no evidence of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Dyer said that in 1960, an AEC contract research firm did a limited survey of 
the Santa Cruz dump and found no significant contamination. 
</P>
<P>
According to the paper delivered by Atomics International at the AEC symposium, 
wastes were put in cylindrical ice cream cartons, which were placed in 
55-gallon drums and sealed with concrete to make sure that they would sink to 
the bottom. About four times a year, the waste drums would be trucked to Long 
Beach for loading on a Navy barge. 
</P>
<P>
The price could not be beat. "No costs are involved since the dumping ground 
trip by the U.S. Navy is regularly scheduled for other purposes and ample space 
is available" on the Navy barge, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid Overtime 
</P>
<P>
But Atomics International paid overtime to its maintenance workers, several of 
whom accompanied each voyage. They would ride in the tug until it arrived at 
the dump, then take a small boat back to the barge to roll the drums over the 
side. The trip to the dump and back could take more than 24 hours, and the men 
were paid for every hour at sea. 
</P>
<P>
James Youngblood of Santa Clarita, a retired Rockwell worker who went on two of 
the dumping trips, said this was a plum assignment and the men took turns 
because of the extra pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they enticed the maintenance workers, the blue-collar workers, with 
the overtime pay," said Eula Youngblood, his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"We just took it for granted it was a safe thing to do," said Junius Wheeler of 
Lake View Terrace, a former maintenance supervisor who helped prepare the drums 
for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
The volumes dumped may have increased after nuclear work shifted from Downey to 
Canoga Park sites and the Santa Susana lab, which have done extensive work with 
test reactors and nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm's Records 
</P>
<P>
Company memos, provided by Rockwell in response to questions about the ocean 
disposal, allude to at least 10 dumping trips in 1958-59, including the 
disposal in September, 1958, of 225 55-gallon drums along with contaminated 
boxes, tanks and conduits. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the company hired commercial haulers, but a problem arose with the 
private firms. Just as the operation involved old ideas of pollution control, 
so did it run afoul of throwback racial attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
During the overnight trips, private tug crews were reluctant to share their 
bunks with the Atomics International maintenance men, some of whom were black, 
according to George Borg, a former health physicist with the company. Borg said 
a tugboat captain told him, "The guys on board don't want to give up their 
bunks to anybody who's colored." As a result, he said, Atomics International 
resumed trips with the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Another bad experience involved a private contractor hired to dispose of 
contaminated dirt around Santa Susana's experimental sodium reactor following a 
1959 accident that melted part of its nuclear fuel, Borg said. 
</P>
<P>
The contractor, Coastwise Marine Disposal Co. of Long Beach, accumulated more 
than 1,000 drums of radioactive waste from various generators without dumping 
it. Eventually the firm, which was cited by the AEC for excessive radioactivity 
at its Long Beach plant, dumped the wastes, including those from Atomics 
International, at another Pacific dump site about 215 miles west of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burbank Firm 
</P>
<P>
This second dump site was used by another San Fernando Valley firm, Isotopes 
Specialties Co. of Burbank, in 1961, according to a report by the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, successor to the AEC. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of follow-up monitoring of the Santa Cruz dump is not necessarily a 
problem, said Don Womeldorf, chief of environmental management for the state 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose the logical answer is that if we look in the areas where the 
greatest amount of dumping took place and find nothing of potential public 
health significance there, then one would conclude that the likelihood is much 
less of having problems where less material was deposited," Womeldorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dyer also said he is not concerned about the Santa Cruz dump, he 
added: "If it hasn't been monitored since 1960, it would probably be useful to 
assure ourselves that there's no significant inventory of radioactive materials 
present in the site. . . . If the public wanted assurances, then it would be a 
good idea."

PREDATORY AND VORACIOUS, THE 'LITTLE EATING MACHINES' THRIVE IN SANTA CLARA 
RIVER DESPITE A 15-YEAR ERADICATION CAMPAIGN.;

AFRICAN FROGS REMAIN KINGS OF THE CANYON

<TEXT>
<P>
In muddy ponds and gurgling creeks above the Santa Clarita Valley, a small army 
of biologists is waging war against a fat, slimy and voracious enemy -- the 
African clawed frog. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the frogs are winning. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't come up with a solution," said Jim A. St. Amant, a state Department 
of Fish and Game biologist, who has tried to eradicate the pesky frogs for 15 
years. "I'm not optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
The camouflage-green frogs are decimating the last known population of the 
unarmoured threespine stickleback, a tiny endangered fish found only where the 
Santa Clara River flows through Soledad Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon frog colony is the largest known infestation of African clawed frogs 
in Southern California, biologists and state and local water officials say. St. 
Amant said the frogs presumably are the descendants of laboratory escapees or 
failed aquarium pets released by disgusted owners. Their only natural enemies 
in California are biologists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Migration Feared 
</P>
<P>
St. Amant said biologists hope not only to save the three-inch stickleback, but 
to prevent the frog from migrating south into reservoirs and flood-control 
channels, where they could reproduce wildly. "They certainly are prolific as 
the devil," St. Amant said. 
</P>
<P>
In an incident reminiscent of a science-fiction movie, the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California destroyed a million of the frogs that clogged 
the large San Joaquin Reservoir above Newport Beach in 1985. District officials 
committed amphibicide by draining the concrete-lined reservoir -- 100 feet deep 
in places -- and scooping out the frogs with nets. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dole, a biology professor from Cal State Northridge, is helping direct the 
latest assault on the frogs, which were brought to the United States from 
southern Africa in the 1940s as laboratory animals. Dole and graduate students 
have trapped and killed thousands of clawed frogs over the past three years, 
trying to assess their numbers and habits in Soledad Canyon. He said they hope 
to compile their findings at the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to trap as many and kill as many as possible," said Cydney 
Henderson, a CSUN graduate student in environmental biology. 
</P>
<P>
Stickleback defenders hope Dole's research will provide clues on how to stamp 
out the resilient amphibian. So far, the research only shows that thousands of 
frogs are gobbling up sticklebacks in the Soledad Canyon ponds. "I really don't 
have any answers," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Eating Machines' 
</P>
<P>
The African clawed frog, or Xenopus laevis, can grow to about eight inches with 
legs extended. They use three tiny black claws on each of their hind legs to 
shred their prey. "They're just little eating machines," said Harvey Fischer, 
curator of reptiles and amphibians at the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
It is illegal to sell or own the black-eyed frogs, but they were once sold in 
pet stores, Fischer said. Many disillusioned aquarium owners freed the frogs 
after the hungry amphibians cleaned their tanks of fish, he said. The African 
frogs also devour insects, crustaceans and other frogs -- even other African 
clawed frogs. 
</P>
<P>
St. Amant discovered the frogs' cannibalistic tendencies when he first 
encountered them in 1974. He plopped tadpoles, adolescents and adults into a 
bucket and drove off to his lab. "I got back and all we had were adults." 
</P>
<P>
While African clawed frogs will eat anything, it appears nothing will eat 
African clawed frogs. 
</P>
<P>
The adults are "predator-proof," secreting a poisonous, foul-tasting mucus that 
repels larger fish and animals. Large-mouthed bass have spit them out. 
Researchers say a red fox ate one and had a heart attack. St. Amant said he fed 
one to a snapping turtle and it wouldn't eat for days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tadpoles Vulnerable 
</P>
<P>
The frogs are only vulnerable while tadpoles, which explains why their 
populations are kept in check in large bodies of water where there are lots of 
predatory fish, said Robin Garcia of the Museum of Natural History in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
For example, catfish were released into the San Joaquin Reservoir to finish off 
the few survivors of the Orange County frog massacre. But predatory fish cannot 
be released in the Soledad Canyon ponds because they would also devour the 
stickleback, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to do something that isn't going to affect the fish at the 
same time," Henderson said. Poison, for example, doesn't work. "The frogs jump 
out and it kills the fish," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Soledad Canyon, biologists even zapped the frogs with carefully aimed 
electrical currents, said Ken Sasaki, a state fishery biologist who heads the 
stickleback recovery team. But the method didn't work in deep ponds. The 
biologists only electrocuted frogs "dumb enough to get into range," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists tried draining one pond to vanquish the frogs, but a year later they 
were back. 
</P>
<P>
Sasaki, St. Amant and about a dozen frog-killers launched an unprecedented 
three-day assault on the Africans last August, catching hundreds in 30 
wire-mesh traps baited with diced beef liver and chicken backs. A second 
large-scale trapping effort was repeated in January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traps Inefficient 
</P>
<P>
"We finally came to the conclusion that that's not going to work," St. Amant 
said. Each female frog releases thousands of eggs and the traps, while killing 
adults, could not stop the next generation, he said. But Sasaki said the traps 
might be able to at least keep populations of the frog in check. 
</P>
<P>
Collecting good data on the frogs is difficult because they spend almost all 
their lives hidden underwater, poking their snouts above the surface 
occasionally to breath. Henderson said the frogs have the amazing ability to 
absorb oxygen from the water through their skin. They can stay in submerged 
traps for hours and not drown. 
</P>
<P>
"A pond could be full of them, and you'll never know it," Sasaki said. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case on a recent Sunday when Henderson and her son, Jason, 11, and 
her boyfriend, Jose Antonio Montes, drove to Soledad Canyon to collect 27 traps 
she had set in a pond the night before. The still pond, bordered by only a few 
trees, looked lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
"What could possibly live here?" Henderson asked. 
</P>
<P>
But Jason and Montes were soon hauling in traps filled with frogs. They dumped 
their catch into a bucket of water and ethyl alcohol where the frogs quickly 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
65 Caught 
</P>
<P>
The death toll was 65 frogs -- not a great catch, Henderson said. The last time 
out, they caught about 160. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the CSUN biology department, Henderson injected the dead frogs with 
alcohol to preserve their innards. She later measures the frogs and saves the 
larger ones for dissection. 
</P>
<P>
Research is limited to post-mortem examinations because the frogs' great 
fertility prevents biologists from tagging and releasing them back into the 
eight ponds under study, Dole said. Dole said he is allowed by the Fish and 
Game Department to bring back live frogs only in a double-locked container to 
prevent escapes. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, perhaps a poison can be developed to kill only the frogs, Sasaki 
said. Dole guessed that sterile males could be released to break the breeding 
cycle -- a method used on Mediterranean fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps, Dole conceded, the research will offer no answers. "It may be a 
waste of time," he said.

DODGERS CRUSH PADRES BUT LEIPER PASSES TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was only the second inning Sunday when the Padre bullpen phone rang. Bullpen 
coach Denny Sommers picked it up, nodded to No. 52 sitting alongside him, and 
said, "It's you, babe." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Leiper felt every muscle in his body tighten. He tried to swallow, but his 
throat was too dry. Instead, he took a deep breath, just trying to calm 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
This would be just be one of 161 professional games that Leiper has pitched in 
his eight-year career, and with the Dodgers already up by five runs on their 
way to a 10-1 victory, this hardly could be perceived as a critical situation. 
</P>
<P>
But Leiper, 27, considered it the game of his life. 
</P>
<P>
It was back in November, as Leiper watched TV at his Scottsdale, Ariz., home, 
that he felt a funny pain in his chest. He thought little of it, and decided to 
go to bed early. He awoke in the middle of the night, wondering if he'd make it 
to morning. 
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to a hospital, where doctors informed him he had suffered a heart 
attack. The Padres and Leiper now call it heart spasms, but whatever the proper 
definition, it was enough to keep Leiper hospitalized for nearly a week. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors couldn't tell Leiper exactly why it happened, but because several 
checkups revealed no further trouble, Leiper felt there was no need to worry. 
</P>
<P>
He went through spring training and the first 2 1/2 months of this season, and 
the only physical ailment he endured was a strained right elbow, which required 
a stint on the disabled list and a 20-day rehabilitation assignment with the 
Padres' triple-A club in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Just one day after returning from Las Vegas, Leiper was called on to pitch an 
inning against Pittsburgh. He retired three of the four batters he faced, but 
something did not feel quite right when he was on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
His pulse was racing, he was short of breath, and he felt a little 
light-headed. It was probably nerves, he thought. 
</P>
<P>
No need to panic. So he just kept it to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, pitching in the fifth inning against the St. Louis Cardinals, 
Leiper found himself bending over on the mound, fighting to catch his breath. 
He got two outs, but could go no further. He summoned the dugout for help, and 
was whisked into the trainer's room. They found his pulse rate alarmingly 
rapid. 
</P>
<P>
When the Padres went to Cincinnati, Leiper stayed back and underwent extensive 
testing at the Scripps Clinic. He had so many wires attached to his body that 
he must have thought he was a walking electronics store. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour test Wednesday, during which he was heavily sedated, he was 
given medication for his heart condition. One pill in the morning and one in 
the evening before bed were the instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's been going through my mind these past few days," Leiper said. "I 
wondered what was going to happen when I went back out there. I wondered if 
maybe my career was over. I wondered what I'd do if I couldn't pitch again. 
</P>
<P>
"So when I got that call to go in today, I felt a nervousness I've never 
experienced. I really didn't know what was going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to block it out of my mind, but really, how was I going to do that?" 
</P>
<P>
With all that to consider while simultaneously trying to throw a baseball past 
major league hitters, it was not surprising that the Dodgers welcomed back 
Leiper by getting three straight hits, including a home run into the 
right-field seats by Franklin Stubbs. 
</P>
<P>
It was like a good news-bad news joke. The good news, Leiper said, was that he 
was breathing fine, believing that everything would be all right, after all. 
The bad news was that he wasn't going to be around much longer anyway if he 
didn't start pitching better. 
</P>
<P>
Leiper finally got Mike Scioscia to line out to first baseman Jack Clark for 
the first out, and after that, everything went quite smoothly. He didn't allow 
another run in three innings, and finished with a pitching line of three 
innings, five hits, two runs, and one walk. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly impressive numbers, but forgive Leiper for feeling as if he had just 
received a new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm sounding selfish by saying this," Leiper said, "but I'm the 
happiest guy in here. I really had a lot of doubts, and a lot of questions 
whether this medication would work. Who knew what was going to happen? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with the way I pitched, but considering the way I feel right 
now, it couldn't have gone better." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Padres, there was no one else who could relate to 
Leiper's sense of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers teed off on starter Ed Whitson, scoring five runs to knock him out 
of the game after two innings. The Dodgers finished the game with 15 hits and 
10 runs, equaling their season high. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored all five of the runs off Whitson -- two in the first inning 
and three in the second -- with no one on, and two outs. 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, Eddie Murray hit a two-run home, the first of two he hit 
in the game. In the second inning, Lenny Harris drove in two runs with a 
double, one of three he hit in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson (14-7), who had pitched at least five innings in each of his previous 
21 starts this season, said that he was troubled by a blister on the middle 
finger of his right hand. He couldn't grip the ball tightly enough to throw 
breaking balls, and when a major league hitter knows he's going to see all 
fastballs, Whitson can tell you what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like throwing batting practice," Whitson said. "When you're pumping 
fastballs like that, no matter how hard you're throwing, they're going to turn 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Padres didn't have a clue on figuring out Dodger starter Tim 
Belcher. Their only rally came in the third inning, when Benito Santiago led 
off with a home run -- his sixth of the season and first since June 14. The 
Padres then loaded the bases with two outs, but Marvell Wynne ended the rally 
by hitting into a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher (8-9) retired 18 of the final 21 batters he faced, finishing with a 
four-hitter, and ending the Dodgers' five-game losing streak against the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"It was ugly out there, wasn't it," said Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn, who 
went one for four, and saw his batting average (.334) drop to its lowest since 
June 4. "I'm so mad (about) the way I'm hitting, I can't even talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have known what kind of day it was going to be when I got so mad that 
I threw my helmet against the wall, and didn't even crack it. Heck, it didn't 
even scratch it. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I hope we can forget about this day forever." 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, but Leiper hopes he never will. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre shortstop Garry Templeton had his left knee drained Sunday morning and is 
expected to miss the upcoming three-game series against the Atlanta Braves. 
Templeton suffered a strained tendon in the back of his knee Wednesday night 
while beating out an infield single and has missed the past four games. . . . 
The Padres now are 10-22 in day games this season. What does Padre Manager Jack 
McKeon plan to do to help rectify the situation? "Pray for rain," he said. . . 
. NBC, figuring at one time that the Padres-Dodgers game Saturday would have a 
bearing on the pennant race, has decided to scratch the scheduled national 
telecast. Instead, it will telecast Houston against San Francisco. . . . 
Perhaps the highlight of the afternoon occurred after the game. Ronnie Rinden, 
a 35-year-old plumber from San Diego, and Rosemary Thompson were married at 
home plate before the start of a game between former Padre players and fantasy 
campers. Rinden, wearing a Padre uniform with No. 00, and Thompson, wearing a 
dress, exchanged vows and walked under crossed bats to the Bruce Springsteen 
song, 'Glory Days.' Rinden then played in the fantasy game . . . McKeon finds 
trade rumors involving Detroit Tigers shortstop Alan Trammell rather curious. 
The rumor, reported by ESPN, had the Padres offering pitcher Greg Harris, 
outfielder Carmelo Martinez and minor league outfielder Jerald Clark to the 
Tigers for Trammell. McKeon said that the rumor is totally unfounded and he has 
not spoken with Tiger General Manager Bill Lajoie in months. . . . The Chicago 
White Sox contacted the Padres to ask if they were interested in Harold Baines, 
according to Padre management, but with his troubled knees, and no designated 
hitter in the National League, the Padres declined. . . . Padre catcher Benito 
Santiago threw out Franklin Stubbs in the second inning, and now has thrown out 
seven of 11 from his knees this season. . . . The Padres are off today, and 
will travel to Atlanta for a three-game series against the Braves. The Padres 
altered their pitching rotation for the Braves' series, enabling Don Schulze to 
start against the Braves instead of making a second straight start against the 
Dodgers. Greg Harris, who originally was scheduled to pitch Wednesday, now will 
be in the bullpen with his next scheduled start Saturday in Los Angeles. The 
revised pitching matchups: Dennis Rasmussen (4-7) vs. Marty Clary (3-1) 
Tuesday; Bruce Hurst (9-8) vs. Tom Glavine (9-6) Wednesday; and Schulze (1-0) 
vs. Pete Smith (2-11) Thursday.

CHARGERS AND TOLLIVER MAKE DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
HENNING SAYS HIS ROOKIE QUARTERBACK WILL NEED STUDY TIME

The Chargers finally signed rookie quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver Sunday, and 
this is how crazy it is when you skip eight days of an NFL training camp in 
search of a better contract: Tolliver still didn't know how much money he was 
getting after finishing his first practice as a Charger. 
</P>
<P>
"No, and I don't care," Tolliver said. "It's going to be at least average with 
what everyone else (drafted in the second round) got." 
</P>
<P>
Vic Vines, one of Tolliver's representatives, said he knows of no better 
contract for a second-round pick. Vines and Joe Courrege struck a four-year 
deal with the Chargers that is believed to be worth between $1.2 million and 
$1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday afternoon, Tolliver was on the field as the Charger veterans 
practiced after a scrimmage against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited to be here," Tolliver said. "(Not reporting) was really hard, 
especially when Coach (Dan) Henning said to get into camp. That was the hardest 
part. When your coach tells you to do something, you do it -- like when your 
dad tells you to do something." 
</P>
<P>
And what made Tolliver feel even worse was a conversation he and Henning had in 
Lubbock, Tex. three weeks before the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
"He came out to work me out, and we had a long talk," Tolliver said. "I told 
him I had never seen much money and I didn't need much to get by. I couldn't 
envision holding out. But I made a liar out of myself. I looked the man right 
in the eye four months ago and told him I'd be in camp." 
</P>
<P>
But that changed when the Chargers made him a second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, I didn't think I'd go as high as I did," Tolliver said. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver's arrival comes eight days after most of the other rookies reported to 
training camp. As a result, while Charger coaches were happy to have him, they 
weren't about to throw a welcoming party. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't talked to him yet," Henning said after practice. 
</P>
<P>
Not even a hello? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm too busy," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
How far behind the rest of the team is Tolliver? 
</P>
<P>
"Eight days," Henning said. "I don't know if he can make that up. He'll have to 
get in extra study time. And Ted (Tollner, quarterback coach) will have to 
spend extra time with him, and that's an extra strain on Ted. I don't like that 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to get him some extra work, but we can't slow down what we're doing. 
I noticed Ted talking with him a couple of times today, and I had to speed 
things up." 
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Chargers and Tolliver broke down last Wednesday, and the 
sides failed to talk on Thursday. But, according to Courrege, he and Vines 
called Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations, on Friday 
with another proposal, and the new talks culminated in a midnight phone call -- 
Dallas time -- Saturday evening. That led to Courrege, Vines and Tolliver 
boarding a plane for San Diego Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Courrege said the Chargers sweetened their offer after Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah," he said. "Billy Joe wouldn't be here if both sides didn't move." 
</P>
<P>
Said Vines: "He's an unusual player. From day one, based on the quarterback 
situation here, we felt there would be complex negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Vines said that Charger owner Alex Spanos wasn't involved in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the Chargers at least have another quarterback in camp. They 
have been so short on bodies during practices this week that public relations 
assistant David Neville has been taking snaps. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Malone and David Archer, the only quarterbacks in camp, split time in the 
scrimmage against the Rams. Malone completed five of nine passes for 34 yards, 
but threw an interception on his first attempt. Archer completed three of five 
passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Henning thought Tolliver could compete for a starting job. But 
now, given Tolliver's late arrival, Henning isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to look at him again," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
But Tolliver was late to camp for precisely that reason -- in case he became 
the starter. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal was that, should Billy Joe become the starter, he would be paid 
comparable to other quarterbacks in the league," Courrege said. "We realize 
today he's an unproven rookie, but we liken him to Boomer Esiason in Cincinnati 
in that they need a quarterback here who can take them to the playoffs. A guy 
who can throw, lead, and who has a personality." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
As for the 11-on-11 scrimmage with the Rams, no Charger helped himself more 
than Wayne Walker, a free agent from Texas Tech. Walker caught two touchdown 
passes, the second of which followed an impressive 20-yard run through the Ram 
secondary. "I think I'd be lying if I said Wayne Walker didn't catch my eye," 
Charger Coach Dan Henning said. . . . Henning also was impressed by running 
back Victor Floyd (33 yards in five attempts), cornerback Roy Bennett (one 
interception), and linebackers Cedric Figaro and Keith Browner. . . . Running 
back Napoleon McCallum, bothered by a hamstring injury, carried three times for 
19 yards. . . . Each team ran three series of 12 offensive plays. The Chargers 
scored twice, and the Rams didn't score. . . . The Chargers also signed running 
back Lionel James and kicker Vince Abbott Sunday, leaving nose tackle Joe 
Phillips, linebacker Gary Plummer and running back Gary Anderson as the only 
unsigned veterans. . . .The Chargers cut running back Robert LaVette, 
linebacker Bob Sebring and center-guard Darrick Brilz.

WOODLAND HILLS WEST COASTS TO AREA 6 TITLE, 9-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Hornback will be spending most of Friday afternoon on the highway. While 
the rest of the Woodland Hills West baseball team will be winging its way 
skyward to the American Legion state playoffs in Yountville, Calif., Hornback 
will be several thousand feet below on Interstate 101. 
</P>
<P>
"No flying for me," the West assistant said. "I'm driving." 
</P>
<P>
A fear of rarefied heights certainly hasn't affected the rest of the team. With 
its 9-2 win over Santa Monica in the Area 6 championship game Sunday at 
Birmingham High, West becomes only the second District 20 team since 1976 to 
advance to the state tournament, which opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
How high is this team? West (27-3) has won 11 games in a row and 21 of 22. In 
four Area 6 playoff games, West outscored its opponents, 33-11. Sunday, 
right-hander Lance Gibson allowed one earned run on eight hits, struck out 11 
and walked one, and now has 17 strikeouts in his last 17 innings. It will be 
West's second shot at the title in four years -- the team last advanced to the 
state tournament in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this team has the three ingredients it takes to win it all," West 
Coach Gary Gibson said. "Pitching, defense and hitting. I truly believe we have 
a very good shot at winning up there." 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth time in as many games, some individual performances ranked right 
up there. Thursday, Jason Cohen drove in four runs. Friday, Paul Geller had 
three hits and Jason Mitchell pitched 7 1/3 strong innings. Saturday, Jeff 
Marks drove in three runs and Ryan McGuire pitched three perfect innings of 
relief. Sunday, Del Marine and Lance Gibson each had three hits and four 
different players drove in runs. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like everybody contributes something every game," Lance Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
West took a 3-0 lead in the first, due in large measure to an error on Santa 
Monica shortstop Kevin Seidel. Three consecutive one-out singles loaded the 
bases for Cohen, who bounced a perfect double-play ball to Seidel -- who nearly 
missed it entirely. Two runs scored on the play and Marks drove in another with 
a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson's only rough inning came in the fourth, when he gave up four consecutive 
singles and was victimized by Cohen's fielding error in left, which allowed an 
unearned run to score and Santa Monica to close within 3-2. Gibson, however, 
retired 16 of the final 17 batters -- six via strikeout.

300 WHIZ KIDS GIVEN A CHANCE TO EXCEL IN UC IRVINE'S PRE-COLLEGE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the other kids were playing sandlot ball this summer, 13-year-old Matthew 
Horowitz made the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew, one of more than 300 whiz kids in UC Irvine's first summer college 
program for gifted students, combined his twin loves, baseball and computers, 
in a digital format. The result was "The Baseball Player," a computer picture 
story starring the Corona del Mar utility player on the mound and throughout 
the infield. In a dramatic final play, Matthew even wins the game by sliding 
into home plate. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, it's his story. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the computer class -- I learn so much here," Matthew said. "Before I 
came here, I hadn't heard of any other kids getting into computers like I do. 
This is the first time I've been around kids like me." 
</P>
<P>
Matthew and his summer classmates, ages 12 to 17, are an extraordinary bunch. 
</P>
<P>
Although few have had the opportunity to take advanced courses in their regular 
schools, all scored higher than the average college-bound high school senior on 
the Scholastic Aptitude Test. The top 10% of this brain pool scored in the high 
600s or low 700s on math or verbal portions of the test -- high enough to 
qualify for honors admission to any UC campus. 
</P>
<P>
"When these kids take the SAT, they're not recalling things they have learned 
in the classroom, they are figuring things out that they've never seen before," 
said James Waldron, director of UCI's honors division. 
</P>
<P>
"These are kids who usually excel, so society typically says, 'They'll do fine 
on their own.' But many of these kids are bored. We want to challenge them. 
They're the people who are going to be running things in 15 or 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,400 top students from 100 schools in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties applied for the three- and five-week summer sessions, which ended 
Friday. The fast-paced classes, ranging from advanced computer to debate, 
chemistry and jazz dance, were taught by UCI professors, including nationally 
known computer scholar Alfred Bork and graduate students and outside 
instructors recruited for their skill and experience with talented teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
At $535 for three weeks and $585 for the five-week session, UCI's Pre-College 
wasn't cheap. John Boomer, director of Pre-College math programs, offered 
seminars in Santa Ana schools to teach test-taking savvy to bright barrio 
youngsters to help them perform well on the qualifying SAT test, and 29 
students who otherwise could not have attended received scholarships for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The students tend to follow their strengths by "majoring" in math or writing 
during their short stay. Their ambitions include medicine, law and high-level 
physics, and many, like Matthew Horowitz, are already deciding between Harvard 
or Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm usually called a "smack" at school," said 14-year-old Erica Grosjean of 
Irvine, recounting with a wince the nickname that the best students at her 
junior high school must endure. "The other kids leave you out. They don't 
invite you to parties because they don't think you're a real teen-ager." 
</P>
<P>
Erica, who plans to become a lawyer, said she was surprised by the Pre-College 
courses because "for the first time, I didn't say anything in some of my 
classes. It was wonderful. I just didn't have a lot to add. 
</P>
<P>
"In my regular school, it's cool not to do your homework. Here, people say, 
'Oh, you didn't do your homework?' It's bad. We've only got three weeks to fit 
in enough to make it worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
That often means a year's worth of material in just weeks -- advanced 
instruction that these young students probably won't have a chance to study in 
their regular school curriculum for three or four years. The style of 
instruction is also very different than what they are likely to encounter 
elsewhere. Race relations and international human rights are analyzed in 
writing exercises, and critical thinking and discussion are encouraged in all 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers here want to hear what you think, and you feel comfortable 
talking in class," said Patti Lee, 13, of Cerritos. "It's not like, 'Sit here 
and be quiet or I'll talk to your parents.' " 
</P>
<P>
In a course called "Thinking and Writing," Lee and her classmates discussed the 
U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, immigration issues and discrimination against 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Made Us Think' 
</P>
<P>
"We talked and wrote about the reasons why people come to the United States 
from Mexico and other countries," said Lee's classmate, Nicole Inouye, 13, of 
Huntington Beach. "It was an experience that really made us think about the 
world and things besides going to the beach or shopping." 
</P>
<P>
For 14-year-old Eddie Suh of Anaheim, the highlight of the summer was physics, 
a scientific discipline he won't be permitted to study in high school until his 
junior year. 
</P>
<P>
"We put liquid nitrogen in a plastic bottle and after about five minutes it 
warmed in the sun and exploded," Eddie said, growing animated at the memory. 
"Gas has more volume than air, you know. It was really neat." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Keh, an outgoing 12-year-old who joined Eddie and three other physics 
class friends for lunch around a table at UCI's Gateway Plaza, said the summer 
classes are "faster and more fun than regular school." 
</P>
<P>
"Nerds don't come here, only cool kids," he added. 
</P>
<P>
These gifted students, who busted the quiet, bespectacled stereotype, responded 
to classroom challenges with challenges of their own, teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
12 Going on 40 
</P>
<P>
"They're 12 going on 40," said Waldron. "They've got a lot of maturing to do 
socially, but academically, they're very sophisticated. They process 
information faster than other kids, and they are able to see multiple sides of 
an issue, approaches that aren't so obvious." 
</P>
<P>
Boomer, a Dana Point junior high instructor who heads the Pre-College math 
program, said the brainy students keep teachers on their toes. 
</P>
<P>
"They are so quick," he said of his algebra and geometry students. "If I make a 
mistake, they catch me." 
</P>
<P>
Myrona Delaney, a star of UCI's graduate drama program, described her young 
theater students as "incredibly curious and enthusiastic. They want to explore 
everything, to learn everything they can." 
</P>
<P>
UCI offers college and high school credits for many of the courses taken by 
students who will enter the 11th and 12th grades in the fall. Younger students, 
who have grown intellectually through the summer, also gain valuable exposure 
to university life. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have an ulterior motive," Waldron said. "We'd love to see these students 
come here when they choose a university. And maybe some of them will enter 
higher education as professors."

DORNAN TRYING TO BLOCK MOVE TO NORMALIZE VIETNAM TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a split with fellow Republicans in Congress -- Vietnam war veterans among 
them -- Orange County's Rep. Robert K. Dornan is opposing moves by the Bush 
Administration toward normalizing relations with Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
And while the conservative Garden Grove Republican is exchanging harshly worded 
memos with the State Department over the normalization issue, he is pressing 
ahead with legislation aimed at making it easier for former Vietnamese citizens 
to gain refugee status in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, a former fighter pilot and television talk show host with a taste for 
controversy, is one of the few members of Congress who is not hesitant to make 
his voice heard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shaping U.S. Policy 
</P>
<P>
And if his critics have sometimes dismissed him as long on rhetoric but short 
on substance, the 56-year-old congressman has in fact made himself a 
significant factor in the shaping of U.S. policy toward its former foe. 
</P>
<P>
In combative correspondence with the State Department, as an official member of 
the U.S. delegation to a conference on Vietnamese refugees, and as a legislator 
who counts 78,000 former residents of Vietnam as constituents, Dornan has 
repeatedly made his weight felt in maintaining a tough line toward the 
communist regime that now rules all of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
While two Vietnam veterans and fellow Republicans, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) 
and Rep. Tom Ridge (R-Pa.), are urging the Administration to move toward 
normalizing relations if Vietnam withdraws its occupying troops from Cambodia, 
Dornan is by far the most vocal -- and strident -- of those who oppose the 
move, several congressional aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Some see Dornan as a rabid anti-communist whose bombastic style is rooted in an 
inability to move beyond the rhetoric of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
But many see him as a serious player in the battle over Vietnam policy, whose 
interests in a wide range of issues, including Vietnamese refugees and missing 
American servicemen, transcend his anti-communist tirades. 
</P>
<P>
Even McCain, a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for 5 1/2 years, acknowledges 
that Dornan, a strong and early supporter of George Bush during the 1988 
primary campaign, has the ear of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously his opinion is respected over there," McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
But McCain insists that "the Administration's decision (about re-establishing 
relations with Vietnam) will be based on a lot of other factors." 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official specializing in Far Eastern affairs said the Bush 
Administration is willing to move toward establishing normal relations with 
Vietnam "in the context of an acceptable settlement in Cambodia," which Vietnam 
has occupied since December, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Such a settlement, the official said, must include withdrawal of Vietnamese 
troops, establishment of a popularly elected government, and provisions to 
prevent the return to power of the Khmer Rouge, which was responsible for a 
bloody reign of terror in Cambodia from 1975 through 1978. Vietnam has vowed to 
remove its troops from Cambodia by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
Even if that occurs, Dornan is adamantly opposed to any rapprochement. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Secretary of State James A. Baker III in May, Dornan wrote: 
"As you know, my Orange County, California, congressional district is home to 
the largest Vietnamese-American community in our country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It would send shock waves throughout Vietnamese families nationwide if 
recognition of Hanoi's government were to occur at all, let alone early, in the 
Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Some voices in Congress will dovetail with Hanoi's propaganda efforts designed 
to create the perception that Vietnam now fits into a new world socialist mold, 
which accepts a Vietnamese version of glasnost and perestroika." Such an 
impression, Dornan said, is patently false. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department's response was largely disappointing, Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second paragraph of a June 2 letter, Assistant Secretary of State Janet 
G. Mullins told Dornan, "Longstanding United States policy envisions 
normalization of relations with Vietnam, involving diplomatic recognition and 
an end to our economic ostracism," once the Cambodia question is settled. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan termed the letter "exceedingly weak," and complained, "I have a good 
enough relationship with Jim Baker that he should have written me himself." 
</P>
<P>
However, Dornan said he believes continuing efforts to pressure the White House 
will pay off. He noted that even the Bush Administration formally opposed a 
move last year by McCain and Ridge to permit Vietnam and the United States to 
set up "interest sections" -- a step in the direction of establishing full 
diplomatic relations -- in each other's capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Dornan said, last month's massacre by the Chinese army of 
protesting students in Beijing may persuade American leaders to take a slower 
approach toward recognition of what Dornan termed a brutal communist 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're going to be so obsessed with China now that they're not going 
to have time to play games about (whether) now is the right time to start 
normalizing relations with Vietnam," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On another front, Dornan's efforts to shape policy toward Vietnam have met with 
more immediate success. 
</P>
<P>
The House last week approved a measure, which Dornan co-sponsored, that would 
for one year make it easier for emigres from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and the 
Soviet Union to earn political refugee status from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, authored by Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), directs the 
attorney general to establish categories of Soviet and Indochinese emigres who 
will not be required to prove they are victims of political persecution in 
order to enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Such proof is now required by the Department of Immigration and Naturalization 
before it will accept emigres as political refugees. 
</P>
<P>
A Dornan-authored bill that would grant presumptive refugee status to any 
Vietnamese interned in a "re-education camp" is pending in the immigration 
subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing Dornan's interest in the refugee issue, the White House earlier 
this year named him to the U.S. delegation to the Conference on Indochinese 
Refugees, held in Geneva last month. Dornan was the only member of Congress 
named as an official delegate. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing crush of refugees from Vietnam into adjacent jurisdictions, 
including Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong, has brought increasing pressure to 
stem the tide. The so-called "first asylum countries" have instituted screening 
procedures to separate victims of political persecution from what they contend 
are "economic emigres," people who fled Vietnam in search of economic rather 
than political security. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan credited the United States with preventing the delegates to the 
conference from adopting rules that would permit the host countries to deport 
those emigres already in residence who fail the "political-persecution test." 
</P>
<P>
"I said to the Dutch ambassador, and anybody else who would listen, 'When did 
we ever drag anyone back across the border into a communist country?' " Dornan 
explained, his voice rising. "The Shah of Iran did it to a MIG pilot once, and 
the guy was executed with great fanfare."

SHOTGUN FIRE KILLS 1, HURTS 4 AT WEDDING RECEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Violence erupted at a wedding reception outside a Santa Ana home early Sunday 
when a man with a shotgun fired three times into the crowd, killing a man and 
wounding four other people, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man's identity was not immediately known, but witnesses said he was 
not a wedding guest and not a participant in a heated argument across the 
street that apparently sparked the shooting. They said he had been carrying 
equipment for the Latin rock band Grupo Azteca, which had been playing for the 
reception, when he was struck in the head and chest by shotgun pellets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Injured Taken to Hospitals 
</P>
<P>
The injured were treated for minor wounds at local hospitals. Hector Renteria, 
28, the bridegroom, said that his father and a cousin were among the injured. 
The father, Jose Renteria, 53, was wounded in the upper right arm by a shotgun 
pellet. The cousin is Efrain Nieves Renteria, 27. Both are of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not identify the other injured, although witnesses said one of them 
was a band member. 
</P>
<P>
Jubencio Sandoval, 21, of Santa Ana, who is suspected of firing the shotgun, 
was arrested on suspicion of murder by Santa Ana police as he was driving near 
the crime scene about 3 a.m. Sunday. Witnesses had given police a detailed 
description of the gunman's car, including its license plate number, Sgt. Jack 
Rife said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people were at the wedding reception at the home of Jose Sanchez 
and Olga Rubio, the mother of the bride, in the 1300 block of South Orange 
Avenue. The guests were either inside the house or in the back yard when the 
shooting erupted, witnesses said. Hector Renteria said in an interview later 
Sunday that no one at the party really knew what sparked the argument, and that 
it is uncertain who or how many people were involved in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see anything," Sanchez said, "but from what I heard from the guests 
is that some discussion took place with a guy from across the street. He was 
not a member of the wedding party, and, frankly, no one here knows who he was." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Couldn't Do Much' 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that the gunman had parked his car on an adjacent street. 
After the argument erupted, he grabbed a shotgun from the car, fired it twice 
into the air, then aimed it toward the wedding crowd, firing three times. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard the shots," Hector Renteria said, "I ran outside to see what was 
going on, and I saw that he (the dead man) got hit in the forehead and the 
chest. I tried to help him but I couldn't do much." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon, Renteria and his bride, Anna, 22, were packing their 
wedding gifts and talking to friends about the tragedy. The couple said that 
although they did not know the dead man, they were saddened by the event. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday up until the shooting had been a happy day for them. They were married 
about 2 p.m. at the Guadalupe Wedding Chapel on Broadway near 3rd Street in 
Santa Ana. Most of their guests gathered at Sanchez's home while the wedding 
party went to a park to have pictures taken. 
</P>
<P>
"We had music and records. People were dancing and eating and having a good 
time. Then this happened," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
Police took three other men in Sandoval's car into custody, but they were 
released a few hours later, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval was being held at Orange County Jail.

CHICAGO ADJUSTING TO LIFE WITHOUT BAINES; 
</P>
<P>
CALDERON MOVES TO THIRD IN ORDER AND HELPS GIVE WHITE SOX THE VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ivan Calderon already misses former Chicago White Sox teammate Harold Baines, 
but Calderon was glad to move into Baines' slot in the batting lineup Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, the White Sox right fielder, moved from the cleanup position to the 
No. 3 spot after Baines was traded Saturday to Texas in a five-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Baines left a gaping hole in the White Sox lineup, one that 
Calderon didn't mind filling in a 3-2 victory over the Angels in front of 
29,363 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon went two for three, drove in a run and scored to help the last-place 
White Sox avoid a four-game sweep against the Angels, leaders in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitting third or fourth in the lineup is almost the same to me," he said. "You 
have to produce a lot of RBIs and home runs from those postions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to do the same job as I was before. But I like hitting third 
better. You get an at-bat in the first inning and usually one more at-bat in a 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon said losing Baines will change the team's personality as well as its 
production. Regarded as one of the top designated hitters in the American 
League, Baines was batting .321 with 13 homers and 56 RBIs before he was 
traded. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played a long time for this team," Calderon said. "Harold's been here 10 
years and I've been here three. Harold's a fine player and I miss him. But 
there's nothing we can do about what happened. We have to move on." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon said the White Sox also need to move up. They're seventh in the AL 
West with a 44-60 record, despite winning 12 of 16 games since the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
"The first half of the season we weren't hustling," Calderon said. "Now we're 
doing more moving and running. We've been doing the job." 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Scott Fletcher, who was acquired from Texas in the Baines trade, 
helped the White Sox get rolling in the seventh inning. He walked, then scored 
on a hit-and-run double by Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
"I hesitated for a second," said Fletcher, who drove in the winning run with a 
sacrifice fly in the eighth. "Then I got going again." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon moved to third when Carlton Fisk flied to center and scored on a 
double by Carlos Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Manager Jeff Torborg said Calderon "has been doing a heck of a job for 
us all year." Calderon is hitting .280 with 11 home runs and 58 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to label players, but he's definitely a gamer," Torborg said. "He's 
chipped in with some real key hits." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon said he was pleased to get at least one victory from the Angels before 
moving to Oakland for another four-game series. 
</P>
<P>
"The Angels have the best pitching in the league," he said. "They're hot right 
now. Everything is happening for them. All we can do is keep doing the same 
things we have been."

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / DONNA CARTER; 
</P>
<P>
PAQUETTE KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE BASEBALL NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Donna Carter 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Paquette has had a full-length basketball court in the backyard of his 
family's Garden Grove home since he was in seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
There he honed the shooting touch he used to average 22 points a game as a 
senior at Rancho Alamitos High School in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But Paquette, 20, avoids the courts now. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to stop," Paquette said. "Last time I played, some guy twisted his 
ankle. . . . I've got to stick to baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Paquette plays third base for the Southern Oregon Athletics, the Oakland 
Athletics' Class-A team in Medford, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Although he enjoyed high school basketball and had opportunities to play at 
community colleges, Paquette knew his desire was to be a professional athlete. 
And his best chance, he felt sure, was in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota Twins drafted him in the 36th round out of high school, but 
Paquette turned down the Twins' offer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't physically or mentally ready," he said. "I hadn't lifted weights. I 
didn't think I was strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming out of high school, (facing) a 6-5 guy on the mound throwing 90 (miles 
per hour), I thought I would be a little scared up there. I got a bit 
intimidated by the hard throwers." 
</P>
<P>
That was more than two years ago. After playing at Golden West College, 
Paquette was drafted by the A's this year. 
</P>
<P>
And these days, it's the 6-foot, 185-pound Paquette who is doing the 
intimidating in his first season of professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, he was in a brief two-for-15 slump that caused his batting average 
to drop from about .380 to .330. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not hitting the ball really well," he said Tuesday. "Right now, I think it 
is a mental thing. I'm trying to work too hard or thinking about every at-bat 
instead of just going out there and trying to hit the ball. I'm jumping at the 
pitch. I have to lay back, keep my weight back. I'm in a small slump right now, 
but I'll get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
He did. 
</P>
<P>
He hit two home runs Wednesday night in a 9-0 victory over the Everett (Wash.) 
Giants, and added a grand slam Saturday night in an 11-5 victory over the 
Eugene (Ore.) Emeralds. 
</P>
<P>
His .363 batting average leads the club, which leads the Northwest League's 
Southern Division, and he is second in hitting in the league. He has a 
team-leading 57 hits in 157 at-bats, and also leads the team in doubles with 
14. He has hit seven home runs, and is second on the team in RBIs with 31. 
</P>
<P>
Paquette also had the team's longest hitting streak earlier this year at 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been swinging the bat well," Manager Grady Fuson said. "When he tells 
you he went into a slump it's because he was hitting .380 and went down to 
about .330. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a chance to be a really good player. He has some great tools and a good 
personality. He is not a high-and-low guy. He has an even temperament. He 
doesn't get down on himself when he has a bad game." 
</P>
<P>
Paquette is finding the Class-A life style more comfortable than he expected. 
</P>
<P>
He had heard the minor league horror stories of players living six to an 
apartment, sleeping on the floor and pinching pennies. 
</P>
<P>
With the A's, he is part of a program designed to give young players family 
support even though they are far from home. 
</P>
<P>
Paquette and a teammate live with a family, and have their own rooms in a 
single-story, three-bedroom home with a pool, a "nice-sized" living room and 
family room -- "and a satellite dish," Paquette said. 
</P>
<P>
"I prepared myself in my mind for the worst, and hoped it would be better than 
I thought and it was," Paquette said. "A lot better. I'm pretty lucky to be 
living with a family right now." 
</P>
<P>
The family supplies the food, although Paquette says he cooks himself. And he 
doesn't have to save his quarters for laundry. 
</P>
<P>
Jim and Darla Arnsberg charge him $50 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Their son (Brad Arnsberg) is playing triple-A ball for the Texas Rangers, so 
they are really baseball-oriented," Paquette said. "They know what it is like, 
and they just want to be supportive."

TAKING SIDES IN THE FUNDING FLAP;

<P>
O.C. POLITICIANS SQUARE OFF WITH ARTS LEADERS OVER CUTOFF FOR 'OBSCENE' ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Senate's decision last week to bar the National Endowment for the Arts 
from funding any "obscene" works, coming on top of the House's symbolic cut in 
the NEA's budget, has quickly spawned two camps in Orange County that are 
vociferously, if predictably, polarized. 
</P>
<P>
On one side are the county's representatives in the House who, in varying 
degrees of enthusiasm, support the Senate's action, which was engineered by 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) in response to a pair of NEA-funded projects. One was 
a $15,000 grant to Andres Serrano for his "Piss Christ" photograph of a 
crucifix in a jar of urine; the other was a $30,000 grant for a touring 
photography exhibition that included works by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, 
some of which are homoerotic. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are officials at the county's leading arts institutions and 
arts advocates who unanimously condemn congressional attempts to reduce, 
restrict or, in some cases, eliminate federal money for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, county arts groups have received more than $2 million in 
grants for varied projects. South Coast Repertory alone has received nearly $1 
million from NEA since 1981, in grants for general operating expenses and 
endowment, according to SCR general manager Paula Tomei. 
</P>
<P>
The fight is also emerging as one of class, not political party affiliation, 
separating wealthy arts supporters from most taxpayers. At least that is the 
view of some local representatives and their staff members. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no indication that Republican elitists are any better than Democratic 
elitists," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), whose district includes parts 
of northwestern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher called those who strongly support federal support for the arts "a 
bunch of snobs. I don't care if they are Republicans or Democrats. To spend 
money on trashy art is an obscenity." 
</P>
<P>
But to some county arts officials who have regular dealings with NEA, 
congressmen who are attacking the agency may be setting themselves up for more 
trouble than they realize. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress is violating its own mandate and its own law," said Kevin Consey, 
director of Newport Harbor Art Museum. "They set up an agency to insulate the 
academic mission of (arts) institutions from political (control). But then they 
turn around and say, 'Well, when it comes to protecting the nation's morals, 
academic freedom doesn't matter, because it doesn't suit our purpose at this 
point in time." 
</P>
<P>
County representatives in the House have been in the forefront of the fight 
over federal funding, participating in heated floor debate and appearing on 
national TV to support their position. Earlier this month, the House approved a 
$45,000 cut in NEA funding in a gesture that was more symbolic than 
substantive. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher recently proposed an amendment to the Department of the Interior 
appropriations bill, which was defeated, that would have eliminated the entire 
$171.4-million appropriation for the arts for the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in support of his amendment, Rohrabacher said: "In an age when 
government is piling up a mountain of debt and is struggling to fund critical 
programs that affect human health and save lives -- like prenatal care, school 
lunches and Medicare -- the time has finally come for us to recognize the 
difference in programs that are essential and programs that are not necessary 
and, in this time of budget crisis, should be zeroed out." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, some of whose remarks on the floor were broadcast on PBS's 
"McNeil-Lehrer News Hour," acknowledged that "some of my colleagues with equal 
concern about these outrageous wastes of taxpayer funds will advocate tighter 
(government) control . . . in the arts. I believe that censorship is not the 
solution. The answer is getting government out of the arts. . . . There is no 
shortage of private financial support for the arts." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) spoke several times for Rohrabacher's 
amendment, calling it "tragic that taxpayers' money is funding this kind of 
trash," and pointing out during a spirited floor debate that Mapplethorpe, whom 
he described as a "homosexual activist," died of AIDS in March. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who appeared on several Cable News 
Network shows to denounce the two grants, has mailed a questionnaire on the 
subject to 10,000 constituents, according to chief of staff Brian O'Leary 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
The survey asks three questions (italics and quote marks are Dornan's): 
</P>
<P>
"1. Do you believe that a photograph of a crucifix submerged in urine could 
ever under any circumstances be considered art? (yes or no) 
</P>
<P>
"2. Do you support Congressman Dornan's position that the federal government 
should not fund "artists" who produce pornographic or sacrilegious art? (yes or 
no) 
</P>
<P>
"3. Do you believe that your tax dollars should be subsidizing any type of 
legitimate art (music, dancing, etc.)? (yes or no) 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said Dornan did not support Rohrabacher's amendment because Dornan 
believes that "there are some legitimate federal expenditures for the arts," 
particularly as seed money for such groups as the Grove Theatre in Garden 
Grove, which applied twice for NEA grants last year. Dornan did support another 
unsuccessful proposal to cut 10% of the NEA's appropriation across the board. 
This move was designed to express displeasure with the Serrano-Mapplethorpe 
grants even more strongly than the $45,000 combined cuts that were passed. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett also said Dornan supports the Helms amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, a Senate committee accepted the symbolic action of Congress against 
the NEA and added a five-year ban on grants to the groups that sponsored the 
two exhibits. On a voice vote, the full Senate passed an amendment by Helms 
that would restrict grants that "promote, disseminate or produce obscene or 
indecent material, including but not limited to depictions of sadomasochism, 
homoeroticism, the exploitation of children, or individuals engaged in sex 
acts; or material which denigrates the objects or beliefs of the adherents of a 
particular religion or nonreligion . . . (or artwork which) denigrates, debases 
or reviles a person, group or class of citizens on the basis of race, creed, 
sex, handicap, age or national origin." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) also denounced the two grants and 
supported the 10% cut, but did not support a complete cutoff of federal arts 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that government control is to be avoided," he said last week, "that 
government assistance without control is permissible. . . . (But) this is a 
legitimate subject of congressional oversight." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), whose district includes parts of south Orange 
County, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the visual-arts community, opinion was vehemently against the Helms 
amendment and strongly in defense of the need for continued government money 
for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's Consey said: "The organizations in question . . . followed 
explicit federal guidelines. They acted in good faith. They engaged in a 
reasonable discourse, put together a proposal, had peer review through the 
system, were awarded the grants and entered into legally binding contracts with 
the NEA to carry out their projects. To retroactively punish these 
institutions, as Sen. Helms is suggesting, brings up serious questions related 
to constitutional law." 
</P>
<P>
Having served on four NEA panels in the last three years, Consey said he is 
troubled at the implication that "in some way NEA panel reviewers do not 
represent the mainstream of American life -- that they are people who are 
disinterested in the basic moral values of American society. My peers and 
colleagues on the panels were for the most part good citizens, well-educated 
people, family members . . . and quite dedicated to the preservation of 
American culture." 
</P>
<P>
Consey said his museum, which receives about 12% to 14% of its exhibition 
funding from the NEA, is on the whole "not particularly dependent on government 
support," as a result of "very generous private-sector donations for 
underwriting exhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that "in our case, the NEA has been very, very important in 
allowing us to produce projects of national significance," such as exhibitions 
of important U.S. painting from the 1950s and a retrospective of work by 
California conceptual artist Chris Burden. 
</P>
<P>
Consey said that the museum will continue to show work that may be 
controversial and that it will continue to seek money for exhibitions from 
government agencies. "Our sense is that aesthetic quality and academic content 
comes first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laguna Art Museum, the executive committee of the board of trustees 
recently passed a resolution in response to the NEA crisis stating that the 
museum recognizes "the legitimate right of an artist to a free expression of 
ideas and emotions," the right of curators and other scholars employed by the 
museum to "unhampered research and expression," and "the greatest degree of 
intellectual and artistic freedom," consistent with "the moral and ethical 
standards" of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Museum director Charles Desmarais said that in past years his institution has 
"not relied that heavily on federal funding for exhibitions." But the Laguna 
museum received a $20,000 NEA award this year and hopes to receive about 
$200,000 in pending NEA applications for various projects. 
</P>
<P>
As worded in the Helms amendment, the Senate's action could reverberate beyond 
the visual arts world to encompass works of theater, poetry, opera and dance 
that include expressions that might offend some viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are thousands of national arts grants in all the disciplines, and out of 
that, two instances have offended someone," said Martin Benson, artistic 
director at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa. "So Sen. Helms sets up a 
mechanism what will be deemed suitable for what can be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is a strong influence on an arts organization to play it as safe 
as humanly possible for fear that someone may be offended, however innocuous it 
may appear to the producing organization itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I don't think any project we've done over our history has been 
morally reprehensible, or we wouldn't have done it. However, what is morally 
reprehensible is in the eye of the perceiver. One four-letter word in a play 
may define obscenity to someone, while it is entirely appropriate to the 
author." 
</P>
<P>
Several county music organizations have received or applied for NEA grants in 
recent years. While officials see themselves as less affected immediately, many 
worry about the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how it would affect me in any way in the choice of (choral) 
literature," said William Hall, music director of the Master Chorale of Orange 
County, which received $2,000 from the NEA for the 1988-89 season and has 
applied for $20,000 for the 1990-91 season. Hall was on an NEA panel last year 
to review proposals for challenge grants. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said: "In the long term, it would affect all the arts. . . . These kinds 
of things, like cancer tend to grow rather than go away." 
</P>
<P>
Martin Weil, former managing director of Opera Pacific and an Orange County 
arts advocate, called Helms' move "the biggest issue to come along in the arts 
on a national level for some time." 
</P>
<P>
Weil said he worried about what he considered the failure to follow "due 
process" regarding the "punitive elements of the amendment, which bans the two 
institutions from receiving any funds for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot impose a law and punish someone on the basis of that law for doing 
something before that law existed," he said. "I'm sure if this were law, it 
would be found unconstitutional."

'PERFECT COUNTRY' AND 'BLINDER PAINTINGS' CHALLENGE POINTS OF VIEW

<TEXT>
<P>
As a child in an all-white classroom in the mid-'50s, I watched my teacher pour 
containers of white, black and yellow paint into a large glass pot. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the melting pot," she said gaily. "All these different races live 
happily together in America." Inside the pot the colors had blended into an 
ugly gray, but the teacher didn't seem to notice. 
</P>
<P>
No era, of course, has a monopoly on bland optimism and blinkered thinking. The 
muddled, unquestioning state of public opinion in today's age of 10-second TV 
commercial spots and focus-group marketing is invoked by Los Angeles artist 
Erika Rothenberg in "America, the Perfect Country,"at the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum through Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Using techniques perfected in advertising -- excited slogans, typecast images 
of sex and race, sociobabbling statistics -- she weds perky texts and colorful 
images. All the images have the flat, simplified look of cartoons or coloring 
books -- the better to convey the cocoon of happy-talk and comforting 
stereotype that enables the average person to tune out. 
</P>
<P>
"Make the World Perfect" reads the label on the cutout image of an aerosol can 
tilting over another of Rothenberg's story boards. "At last! A way to end war, 
hunger and disease!" trumpets the first panel, awash in aerosol-sprayed smoke. 
The next panel shows what life was like "before": a sad-looking black child 
with the swollen belly of malnutrition, a morose-looking man being comforted by 
a Latina with a black eye, dark-skinned guerrilla fighters, houses billowing 
with smoke, a missile launching. In the "after" panel, a smiling white New York 
Mets player greets his biracial fans, a white couple gets married, white ballet 
dancers pose and a blond girl with a teddy bear eats an apple. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, nothing has changed except a point of view; don't think about the 
bad stuff and -- voila! -- it goes away. Rather than simply offering a sweeping 
indictment of fundamentalist right-wing beliefs, however, Rothenberg locates 
the ambivalence in even the most ardent liberal heart. Who has not wished the 
world's problems would quietly solve themselves so that the pleasant aspects of 
middle-class existence could be pursued without guilt? 
</P>
<P>
The installation also includes a full-size viewer-interactive miniature golf 
game, "Which Country Is the Best Country?," garnished with an eye-catching 
spinning globe. But although there are six traps, each labeled with the name of 
a different country, all but one ("U.S.A.") have been walled up in various 
clumsy ways to keep balls out. 
</P>
<P>
The artist's point, of course, is that an American's seemingly boundless 
freedom of choice -- in art and other matters -- is contingent upon policies 
that are subject to change. Someone in charge can mess with the game (by 
censoring a potentially controversial exhibition, for example) and thereby 
circumscribe the range of choices. 
</P>
<P>
By wrapping her message in such superficially unthreatening visual packages, 
Rothenberg shrewdly gains a lot of ground, co-opting the seductiveness of the 
very media establishment whose quick fixes and intellectual Pablum she is out 
to discount. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Fehlau's "Blinder Paintings," at Newport Harbor through Oct. 1, are 
invitations to enter a rigorous discussion about the nature of a work of art. 
Anyone expecting a dreamy, cosmic experience is advised to look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Although just as dependent on the viewer's perceptual awareness as "light and 
space" art, Fehlau's work is far more autocratic and unrelentingly 
intellectualized. Each painting offers the viewer a group of sometimes 
conflicting (and often hard-to-process) visual information that must somehow be 
assimilated and assembled in the mind. 
</P>
<P>
On the panels are various configurations of identical greenish-black painted 
bars that line up perfectly at one point but subsequently fall out of sync. 
There are just enough bars that you can't easily account for them all without 
sending your eyes through dizzying calisthenics. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just for starters. Each surface is actually composed of two layers, 
the panel and its sailcloth covering, curving (imperceptibly to the eye) in 
such a way that the bars on the sides of the panel read more sharply than those 
in the center. The nylon sailcloth works like a theatrical scrim -- veiling the 
shadowy, insubstantial bars painted underneath it on the panel and serving as a 
backdrop for the bold, slightly textured bars painted on its outer surface. 
</P>
<P>
But wait: There's more. Aluminum "blinders" attached at either side of each 
wood panel -- most project from the wall at 90-degree angles or are 
free-standing -- firmly delimit the viewer's gaze at the work. So you are 
thrust, willy-nilly, into the midst of a shifting play of surfaces and marks 
that refuses to stand still. In addition, each work actually contains a 
back-to-back marriage of two double-surfaced painted panels. Which means that 
the piece is like a hall of mirrors (the light-reflecting aluminum plays its 
part here, too) that continually shunts the viewer back and forth in a vain 
attempt to find a central perceptual experience. 
</P>
<P>
And that's the central riddle of this work. It has no center, no inside or 
outside in the conventional senses of those terms. Fehlau's paintings are demon 
constructs of a mind that revels in the play of ideas and shows no mercy for 
the impatient, the merely sensual or the philistine viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Erika Rothenberg's "America, the Perfect Country" remains at Newport Harbor 
Art Museum through Sept. 24; Fred Fehlau's "Blinder Paintings," through Oct. 1. 
Both exhibits are part of the New California Artists series. The museum is at 
850 San Clemente Drive in Newport Beach and is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Tuesday through Sunday. Admission is $3 general, $2 for students and seniors, 
$1 for children 6 to 17. Admission free for everyone on Tuesdays. Information: 
(714) 759-1122.

LAGUNA PROJECT GETS LIFE: "The Tell," the 600-foot-long photomural erected 
alongside the Sycamore Hills area of Laguna Canyon Road, is featured in the 
"Snapshot" section of the August issue of Life magazine. Referring to the 
donated snapshots that compose the mural, the story says the piece "tells an 
uncensored story of California life, births, deaths and volleyball on the 
beach. The nudes got top billing -- out of sight of the children." 
</P>
<P>
The piece, devised as an Orange County Centennial project to raise 
consciousness about the need to preserve the natural environment, is due to be 
completed by Aug. 19, the day it will be formally dedicated.

ISRAEL PROPOSES TRADING PRISONERS WITH SHIITES

<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel today proposed trading all his 
country's Shiite Muslim captives for all captured Israeli soldiers and foreign 
hostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said they had received no immediate confirmation of a claim 
from a Shiite group that it executed a U.S. Marine hostage to retaliate for 
Israel's abduction of a Shiite cleric. 
</P>
<P>
But they reiterated Rabin's offer, made earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel repeats its call for the release of Israeli and other hostages held by 
Shiite groups in Lebanon. Israel is offering to trade prisoners, detainees and 
hostages," Rabin told reporters in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
His statement, read from a prepared text, was also broadcast on state-run 
Israel radio. Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said the 
offer was made on behalf of the government. 
</P>
<P>
"According to this proposal, all the Israeli prisoners and foreign hostages 
held by Shiite groups in Lebanon would be swapped for all the Shiite prisoners 
kept by Israel, including Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, Jawad Kasfi and others," he 
said. "The exchange would be conducted through the International Red Cross 
according to the procedures accepted in such cases." 
</P>
<P>
Obeid is an influential Shiite Muslim cleric kidnaped by Israeli commandos 
Friday in south Lebanon, and Kasfi is another Lebanese Shiite seized by Israeli 
forces in Lebanon last December. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources estimate 50 to 60 Shiite Muslims from Lebanon are held in 
Israeli prisons. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia, which helps patrol Israel's 
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon, holds about 300 Shiites in a 
prison at Khiam in south Lebanon. It was not immediately clear if this group 
would be part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres said earlier today that Israeli officials 
hoped that Obeid can be swapped for three Israeli soldiers missing in Lebanon 
since 1986.

Pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim extremists said they hanged Marine Lt. Col. William 
R. Higgins today in retaliation for the Israeli abduction of a Hezbollah 
spiritual leader, and the group holding another American hostage threatened to 
kill him. 
</P>
<P>
The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, an offshoot of the pro-Iranian 
Hezbollah or Party of God, released a videotape of a man who appeared to be 
Higgins hanging from a gallows and said they had killed him today. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, another offshoot 
of Hezbollah, said it will kill American University of Beirut deputy 
comptroller Joseph Cicippio on Tuesday if Hezbollah leader Abdel Kareem Obeid 
is not released by Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The threat against Cicippio came in a statement delivered to the office of the 
independent An-Nahar newspaper accompanied by a color photograph showing 
Cicippio bearded and smiling. There was no independent confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
A color videotape delivered to Western news agencies in Beirut shortly after 
Higgins' reported execution showed a man who appeared to be Higgins hanging 
from a gallows inside a room. The body was dressed in khaki fatigues and his 
hands and bare feet were bound. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second tape included a close-up shot that showed Higgins' face clearly, 
and a United Press International reporter and other journalists who had seen 
other photographs and videotapes of Higgins said they were sure the dead man 
was the U.S. Marine officer. 
</P>
<P>
There had been previous unconfirmed reports that Higgins died during torture 
shortly after he was kidnaped in February, 1988, and the Oppressed on Earth had 
threatened to kill Higgins twice before the most recent ultimatum. There was 
nothing in the videotape released today to show on what date it was taken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Make Him a Lesson' 
</P>
<P>
A one-page typewritten statement from the Organization of the Oppressed on 
Earth said Higgins was executed because "the criminal America did not consider 
our threats as serious." 
</P>
<P>
"The American spy was hanged at 3 p.m. (5 a.m. PDT) . . . to make him a 
lesson," said the statement attached to the videotape. "We reiterate our stand 
that the sheikh (Obeid) must be freed along with his two brothers (relatives) 
because what will happen next will be worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Let America and Israel shoulder the whole responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
A helicopter-borne Israeli commando force kidnaped Obeid and two of his 
relatives early Friday from a Shiite village in southern Lebanon and then flew 
them to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins, 44, headed a U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon when he was 
kidnaped near the city of Tyre in February, 1988. He was one of 17 Westerners 
believed held hostage in Lebanon, including nine U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Cicippio, 56, was kidnaped Sept. 12, 1986. The Revolutionary Justice 
Organization also claims to hold another American hostage, Edward Tracy, 55. 
</P>
<P>
In the only previous reported hanging of a hostage, a videotape possibly 
showing British captive Alec Collett was released by his captors April 23, 
1986, but the pictures were not clear and observers had doubts whether it was 
Collett who was shown.

<P>
A controversy over whether ministers should preach that only Christians can 
enter heaven was referred to a committee today at the convention of the 
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). 
</P>
<P>
The 700 delegates postponed a vote to accept or reject a report on the 
so-called "Jesus Resolution" drafted with an eye toward healing the rift 
between the church's theological conservatives and liberals but which may only 
have deepened them. The proposed resolution asks that the Disciples affirm that 
salvation is possible only through Jesus and that only Christians will have 
eternal life after death. 
</P>
<P>
The report on the proposed resolution was prepared by the church's Commission 
on Theology and suggests it might be inappropriate and self-righteous to say 
salvation is possible only through Jesus. It says only God, not Christians, can 
determine who should enter heaven.

Poles fought to buy meat and besieged other food stores today, one day before 
massive price increases meant to launch a Western-style market system. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't take pictures! It's already humiliating enough to line up like this," 
people shouted at a news photographer as they fought to get into a bare-shelved 
state meat store in Warsaw that had only sausage to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of meat and most foods are expected to soar 200% to 300% on Tuesday when 
meat rationing ends after seven years and prices are partly freed under a 
government "marketization" plan widely condemned as ill-prepared and lacking 
sufficient compensation. 
</P>
<P>
In Parliament, outgoing Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski and Finance Minister 
Andrzej Wroblewski faced impeachment threats for triggering 100% inflation, a 
huge budget deficit, collapse of the currency and massive food shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Communist parliamentary deputies approved Rakowski's proposal for Interior 
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak to be the party's candidate to succeed him as prime 
minister following Rakowski's election as Communist Party leader Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rakowski's 10 months as prime minister have seen a rapid deterioration of the 
economy on all fronts. Industrial output has fallen and Poland is currently 
accepting emergency food donations from the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's food price rises will plunge 60% of Poland's 38 million inhabitants 
below the poverty line, according to some Communist Party officials who oppose 
the government's plan. 
</P>
<P>
Government, Solidarity and other opposition leaders have forecast a possible 
public upheaval that could sweep away an agreement on political and economic

China's top leaders and generals today congratulated the army for suppressing 
June's pro-democracy demonstrations, but foreign ambassadors in Beijing 
protested by boycotting the Army Day celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech Defense Minister Gen. Qin Jiwei twice praised Deng Xiaoping in what 
appears to be a growing personality cult surrounding the 84-year-old senior 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Led by Deng Xiaoping, the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries 
played a great role in this struggle," Qin told an audience of senior officers 
and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Deng, head of the powerful party and state central military commissions, was 
absent from the celebrations in the Great Hall of the People. No explanation 
was given. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors and defense attaches from the United States, the European 
Community, Scandinavian countries and Japan boycotted the celebrations.

9 LOST AS GULF OIL RIG UPSETS IN FACE OF STORM

An oil rig capsized today as it headed shoreward to escape an advancing storm 
in the Gulf of Mexico, and as many as nine workers were feared trapped inside, 
the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the 13 workers believed to have been aboard were plucked from the water 
by fishermen and a Coast Guard helicopter, said Chief Petty Officer Michael 
Robling. The Coast Guard said two others were picked up, but later said it 
could not confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer Steve Guy said some workers "may be trapped inside the rig below 
the surface of the water." 
</P>
<P>
The rig, a self-propelled vessel with legs that can extend to the sea floor, is 
of a type in which the crew quarters can be sealed, said Lt. Steve Hardy. It is 
not known if the missing workers were in a sealed section, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They usually have watertight doors which should have been secured if the 
vessel was underway," Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
Air trapped inside would be the only oxygen for any survivors, Hardy said. He 
said he could not estimate how long the air supply would last. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue efforts were hampered by 10-foot seas, 35 m.p.h. wind and heavy rain 
from the fringes of Tropical Storm Chantal. The Coast Guard flew divers to the 
rig, and helicopters and a patrol boat were dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel, leased to Chevron Oil Corp., had been ordered toward land because 
of the storm, said spokesman Jonathan Lifa. 
</P>
<P>
The rig was in about 25 feet of water 25 miles off Morgan City. The accident 
was reported about 5:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea how it capsized. The workers on the rig are suspected to have 
been asleep" when the rig fell over, Guy said. 
</P>
<P>
Seas were about 3 feet when the order came to move, but the weather status at 
the time is not known, Lifa said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy said that the Coast Guard recently began inspections of such vessels 
because of a "significant casualty rate" from accidents. He said the rig's 
owners had met today's deadline for applying for an inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer Rich Muller said the rig belonged to Lafayette Lift Boat and was 
managed by Avis Boug Co. of Folsom. 
</P>
<P>
Lafayette has no listing, and a woman who answered the phone at Avis Boug said 
officials were on their way to the scene and unavailable to comment.

Concert violinist Eugene Fodor was released from custody today after spending 
the weekend in jail on charges he broke into a motel room and was in possession 
of drugs and a dangerous weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Fodor, 39, of New York City, had been held in lieu of $50,000 cash bail after a 
judge refused to accept his 300-year-old violin as surety. Superior Court 
Justice Joseph Mitchell today reduced bail to personal recognizance and set a 
pretrial conference Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Fodor, the first American to share honors in the prestigious Tchaikovsky violin 
competition in Moscow in 1974, was arrested Friday morning after a chambermaid 
in the Vineyard Harbor Motel found him in a room that was listed as unoccupied. 
Fodor allegedly was carrying 20 grams of cocaine, a small amount of heroin, a 
dagger, a hypodermic needle and some pills when he was arrested.

'NEANDERTHAL,' NEUHARTH TOLD ON 'SKY GIRLS' PLEA

<P>
Today's edition of USA Today carried a letter signed by more than 175 of the 
newspaper's 426 newsroom employees, saying they were "offended, outraged and 
embarrassed" by USA Today founder Al Neuharth's suggestion that airlines should 
make the skies friendlier by bringing back shapely, young "sky girls." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also carried an interview with the head of the Assn. of Flight 
Attendants, who said union members were "stunned" by the former Gannett Co. 
Inc. chairman's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling was that Al Neuharth is either a Neanderthal or some sort of court 
jester," said Susan Bianchi-Sand, 42, who added that she has been a flight 
attendant for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
In a column last Friday, Neuharth said he began taking commercial flights for 
the first time in 19 years after his recent retirement, and did not like what 
he found. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the young, attractive, enthusiastic female flight attendants -- then 
called stewardesses -- have been replaced by aging women who are tired of their 
jobs or by flighty young men who have trouble balancing a cup of coffee or 
tea," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
If he were running an airline, Neuharth said he would "ease today's cabin 
pressures" for passengers by insisting on old-fashioned vital statistics for 
"sky girls": unmarried female nurses, under age 25, measuring 5-foot-4 or less 
and weighing under 115 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We say this is bigoted and insulting -- not only to flight attendants and 
nurses, but also to the women and men who work for Gannett," the employee 
letter said.

Xerox Corp. reported a 7% increase in second quarter profits today, saying the 
results indicate it is on track toward achieving its goals in a major 
restructuring launched in January. 
</P>
<P>
The office products company said profits rose to $179 million, or $1.67 a 
share, from $167 million, or $1.59 a share, in the year-ago second quarter. 
Revenues rose 7% to $4.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In January Xerox set a major restructuring program, including layoffs of 2,000, 
or 2% of its work force, and an exit from the medical systems business. It took 
a pretax charge of $275 million to write off the non-performing assets.

MAJOR BANKS LOWER PRIME RATE TO 10.5%;

<P>
Several major commercial banks, including the nation's largest, lowered their 
prime lending rates a half percentage point today to 10.5%, signaling lower 
borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
First Bank of Chicago was the first to take the step shortly before the opening 
of the stock market, with Chemical Bank, Continental Bank, Morgan Guaranty 
Trust Co., Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Bankers Trust Co., No. 1 Citibank 
and Security Pacific National Bank joining in. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction, effective immediately, follows similar cuts by San 
Francisco-based Bank of America on Friday and Chase Manhattan Bank more than 
three weeks ago. A few other smaller banks have reduced their prime rates since 
Chase's move. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bank's Cost 
</P>
<P>
The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money, including interest 
it pays on savings accounts or certificates of deposit, and trails more subtle 
increases in other interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for calculating 
loans to businesses and for determining many types of fixed and adjustable-rate 
consumer loans. Mortgage rates are not included in that category. 
</P>
<P>
Today's decrease was widely expected by most economists due to continuing signs 
that the Federal Reserve is seeking looser credit policies in response to a 
slowdown in economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Economists have speculated that major banks did not immediately follow Chase, 
which cut its prime rate on July 10, partly because they wanted to determine 
whether the Fed would keep pursuing lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The sentiment in the marketplace was that Chase was too early and everyone 
else was waiting until the federal funds rate stayed below 9%," said Elizabeth 
G. Reiners, an economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 8 7/8% by late morning today, down from nearly 9% Friday.

Top officials in the Department of Housing and Urban Development should have to 
keep a log of every visitor and telephone call as a means of discouraging 
influence-peddling that pervaded the agency, a former senator proposed today. 
</P>
<P>
"Some will say that requiring such reports as a matter of law is too 
burdensome, is an interference with privacy or is micromanaging," former Sen. 
William Proxmire (D-Wis.) told a House panel. "Keep in mind these are public 
officials. They are on the public payroll. They are dealing with hundreds of 
millions of dollars of the public's money." 
</P>
<P>
Proxmire, who was chairman of a Senate subcommittee with responsibility for 
overseeing the department, acknowledged today that he was "chagrined that I had 
no idea what was going on at HUD" until congressional hearings began in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses before the House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and 
employment have said that HUD contracts worth millions of dollars were awarded 
on the basis of political influence. 
</P>
<P>
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who took office this year with a pledge to clean up 
the department, has estimated that the corruption has cost the government $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the deals now under investigation involved former HUD officials or 
well-connected Republicans who used their influence at the top levels of the 
agency to gain approval for projects in which they had some financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
Proxmire said his proposal, requiring reports on such meetings be given to 
Congress and the news media, would force HUD officials to make an immediate 
public accounting of their actions in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee heard later today from Maurice Barksdale, a former HUD 
assistant secretary, and John Knapp, former general counsel to the department.

Wang Laboratories Inc., formerly one of the computer industry's top performers, 
posted a $424.3-million loss for its latest fiscal year today and said it is 
suspending its dividend while it restructures operations to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
Wang stock was off 37.5 cents at $6 on the American Stock Exchange in heavy 
early afternoon trading, as Wall Street reacted to what one trader called a 
"dreadful" earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
The company's second straight money-losing quarter gave it a net loss for the 
year ended June 30 of $424.3 million, or $2.59 a share, compared with a profit 
of $92.7 million, or 56 cents a share, in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Wang's long profit slide has been blamed on its slowness to switch to operating 
systems that are compatible with computers made by other companies.
