35 CAMARILLO BUILDINGS MAY NEED MAJOR EARTHQUAKE-PROOFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The landmark St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church and 34 other Camarillo buildings 
may require substantial improvements to become earthquake safe under a new 
amendment to the county building code. 
</P>
<P>
Repairs at the picturesque church, with its 90-foot bell tower and an 
underground crypt for members of the Camarillo family, must be complete within 
five years, according to the ordinance amending the code. 
</P>
<P>
Other structures, including most of the retail stores in Camarillo's old 
downtown that are built of concrete blocks without steel reinforcement, will 
have up to eight years to complete repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Now known as the St. Mary Magdalen chapel, the church was built by the 
Camarillo family in 1912 for $75,000 and was meant to last, said Lilian 
Agaposs, church business administrator . 
</P>
<P>
"These walls are three feet thick," she said. "It would take an awful lot to 
push this building down." 
</P>
<P>
Father Damian Fernando, assistant pastor at the church, said that if an 
earthquake were strong enough, it could knock any building down. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there would be nobody left inside the church. They would all be outside 
praying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's ordinance affects 22 other buildings scattered throughout the 
unincorporated areas of the county, including eight buildings in Piru and two 
in the Meiners Oaks area, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo is the only incorporated city affected by the county ordinance 
governing unreinforced masonry, because Camarillo contracts with the county for 
building and safety services. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo must still adopt the county's ordinance before it becomes law in the 
city, but the City Council is expected to hear the issue next month, Assistant 
City Manager Larry Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities, like Ventura, have separate earthquake ordinances. All the 
ordinances are designed to force building owners to make their buildings safe 
by adding steel reinforcement to structures built of concrete-block or brick 
before 1962. After that year, steel reinforcement was required. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, adopted July 24, sets a timetable by which the improvements must 
be completed. It allows a maximum of eight years for buildings that attract 
fewer than 20 people at a time and allows only four years for buildings of 
public assembly like the church. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance requires owners to order seismic audits of their buildings to 
determine how much work they will need to meet the new standards. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Maloney, of Ventura Group Architects in old Camarillo, said seismic 
audits to find specific problems will cost about $2,000 for each building 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings in old Camarillo will likely need steel reinforcement at their glass 
storefronts, which could cost as little as $5,000, Maloney said. But the dollar 
figure is impossible to estimate without reports, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance has prompted merchants in the old downtown area to put on hold 
some superficial improvements to the area, said Maloney, who is also a member 
of the merchants association. Members of that group had planned to spruce up 
their storefronts in an effort to attract more business.

EYE SURGEON TO PAY $250,00 TO SETTLE SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICARE: THE MONEY IS PART OF A SETTLEMENT MADE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AFTER THE 
LA JOLLA SURGEON WAS ACCUSED OF FRAUD BY A FELLOW DOCTOR.

<P>
A La Jolla eye surgeon agreed Monday to pay $250,000 and perform 400 hours of 
community service to settle a lawsuit that accused him of Medicare fraud, 
federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Raymond Y. Chan agreed to the deal to bring to a close a suit -- involving 
glaucoma operations -- that originally was filed by another eye surgeon under a 
novel federal anti-fraud law, lawyers in the case said. 
</P>
<P>
Chan denied any wrongdoing and said Monday through his lawyers that he settled 
only to avoid a lengthy and expensive court case. 
</P>
<P>
The former colleague, Dr. Paul E. Michelson, stands to pocket $50,000 of the 
$250,000 for "whistle-blowing," though both he and his Los Angeles attorney 
insisted his motive was not financial. Rather, lawyer John Phillips said, 
Michelson tipped off federal prosecutors because he was "conscience-bound by 
his professional obligations." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also provides for the payment of $75,000 in attorney's fees, 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
The case is believed to be one of the first in the nation to be brought under 
the 1986 anti-fraud law that centered on allegations of Medicare fraud, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. John J. Robinson said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The law is more commonly used as a tool in cases involving charges of fraud in 
defense contracting cases, lawyers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors did not bring a criminal case against Chan. There was not enough 
evidence of criminal intent, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Michelson, 47, who lives in La Jolla, said Monday that he stands by his 
decision to turn in a fellow doctor. "You just reach a point where you have to 
do something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michelson filed the suit against Chan in April, 1987, in federal court in Los 
Angeles. He was joined in the case by a Los Angeles nonprofit corporation 
called Taxpayers Against Fraud, a group formed by public interest lawyer 
Phillips to help in cases brought under the anti-fraud law. 
</P>
<P>
The law, called the False Claims Act, was enacted originally in 1863. Under the 
1986 amendments, a private citizen may file a civil suit in the name of the 
government alleging fraud by a contractor and share in any financial recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Michelson filed his suit after becoming curious when both he and Chan worked in 
the mid-1980s at the same office, part of the Scripps Clinic and Research 
Foundation. It alleged that Chan administered unnecessary office laser 
treatments for glaucoma and billed Medicare for complex, more expensive 
hospital surgeries, prosecutor Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved about 200 treatments, primarily on elderly patients, from 
1983 to 1986, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Michelson's original claim was also filed against Scripps, alleging that it had 
a supervisory and administrative duty in the Medicare program. Scripps settled 
that suit in 1988 for $350,000, Robinson said. Michelson earned about $58,000 
from that settlement, all of which he donated to charity, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Alerted by the filing in Los Angeles, meanwhile, federal prosecutors in San 
Diego opted to take over the case -- exactly the sort of procedure provided for 
by the 1986 anti-fraud law. 
</P>
<P>
Chan said Monday in a statement issued by his San Diego lawyer, Michael L. 
Lipman, that he denied "any wrongdoing whatsoever with regard to his billing or 
treatment of patients." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than endure further court action, however, Chan decided to settle, 
Lipman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Litigation against the federal government carries two problems," Lipman said. 
</P>
<P>
"One, the cost is astronomical to defend yourself against allegations made by 
the federal government," Lipman said. "And, secondly, you never have an upside, 
you only have a downside. 
</P>
<P>
"If you win, they never apologize and they never pay you for your attorney's 
fees and all the grief you've suffered. And, if you lose, you can get destroyed 
financially." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Barry Ted Moskowitz approved the settlement in an order signed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Michelson said he plans to turn over the $50,000 he is due to charity, 
including new medical ethics departments at UC San Diego and at Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore.

FREEWAYS TURN INTO DEATHTRAP FOR MIGRANTS; 
</P>
<P>
FATALITIES: A GROWING NUMBER OF ILLEGAL MIGRANTS ARE BEING KILLED AS THEY DASH 
ACROSS FREEWAYS NEAR THE BORDER AND THE SAN ONOFRE CHECKPOINT AS THEY ATTEMPT 
TO AVOID DETECTION.

<P>
As more and more unauthorized immigrants cross the U.S.-Mexico border, the toll 
of undocumented pedestrians struck by vehicles and killed on the freeways of 
San Diego County continues to mount. 
</P>
<P>
This past weekend, authorities say, three more people believed to have been 
undocumented immigrants were killed along Interstate 5. In recent years, 
border-area freeways have become deathtraps for undocumented people who attempt 
to negotiate the busy roads on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far in 1990, authorities say, 25 people believed to have been in the 
United States illegally have been struck and killed on freeways on the two most 
hazardous roadway zones in the San Diego area. In 1989, there were 37 such 
fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
Including the most recent victims, officials say 115 known or suspected 
undocumented immigrants have been killed since 1987 in the two principal 
problem areas. Most are killed during the evenings, the most popular time for 
illicit border-crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers do not include undocumented people killed on other stretches of 
area freeways and on other roadways in the San Diego area. Authorities don't 
separate figures for those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Most deaths occur in a dense grid of highways -- including Interstates 5 and 
805 and California 905 -- that converge near the U.S.-Mexico border. The 
roadways are often barriers to undocumented pedestrians who have just crossed. 
</P>
<P>
But a rising number of them are being struck and killed 70 miles to the north, 
near the U.S. immigration checkpoint north of Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Unauthorized immigrants often attempt to circumvent the checkpoint on foot, 
usually after they have been dropped off on the shoulder or the median of I-5 
by smugglers. Often, they must must negotiate eight lanes of high-speed traffic 
to avoid the checkpoint, and then they must repeat the hazardous feat in order 
to reconnect with smugglers who have cleared the checkpoint in their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims are unaccustomed to the speed of traffic on California 
roads. Women, children and the elderly are often struck. Sometimes victims were 
unable to keep up with others in their groups. Most are Mexican citizens, 
though some Central Americans have also been killed. 
</P>
<P>
About half the victims are struck by hit-and-run drivers, according to the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Various government agencies -- including the CHP, the state Department of 
Transportation and the U.S. Border Patrol -- have taken action aimed at 
reducing the carnage, but the fatalities continue. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to do more," said Claudia Smith, counsel in Oceanside for California 
Rural Legal Aid, which provides legal assistance to immigrants. "The problem is 
increasing." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Caltrans has taken a number of steps in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Among the department's efforts have been the pruning of roadside brush that 
provides cover for immigrants; the improvement of lighting in trouble spots; 
the posting of roadside flashing signs warning motorists of the presence of 
pedestrians, and a public awareness campaign aimed at both immigrants and 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans now plans to install huge overhead flashing signs on the two major 
freeways near the border zone in an effort to sensitize motorists to the 
hazard. Most drivers are not aware of the possible presence of pedestrians on 
freeways, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned about the problem, and we're seeking solutions in a 
number of ways," said Anita Yoder, a Caltrans spokeswoman in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
However, a number of immigrant advocates believe Caltrans could do more, 
including installing overhead flashing signals near the immigration checkpoint 
in northern San Diego County. There are no plans now to put up the signs, said 
Jim Larson, a Caltrans spokesman in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. immigration officials say the number of people attempting to enter the 
United States illegally via the U.S.-Mexico border is on the rise, contributing 
to an increased number of undocumented pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 25 killed thus far this year, the majority -- 16 -- were hit by 
vehicles while traversing roadways near the border strip. 
</P>
<P>
The other nine died after being hit along I-5 in the vicinity of the U.S. 
immigration checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The two most recent victims -- a man and a woman seen holding hands as they 
crossed the freeway shortly before they were struck -- were hit Saturday night 
at a point just south of the checkpoint. They remained unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, a man was struck along I-5 near the U.S.-Mexico border. He 
was identified only as Jose Toribo Barrales.

ENCINITAS RAIDS LEAD TO DEPORTATION OF 28 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After receiving many complaints from Encinitas residents about the presence of 
transients and illegal aliens in encampments around the city, the San Diego 
County Sheriff's Department and U.S. Border Patrol arrested 29 people Sunday 
and deported 28 of them, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies from the Encinitas station and Border Patrol agents entered 
four encampments and arrested 29 people for trespassing, said Deputy Larry Van 
Dusen, a Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight of those arrested were illegal aliens, said Ted Swofford, a Border 
Patrol spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five volunteered for immediate deportation and deportation proceedings 
were started against the remaining three, who are suspected of criminal 
activities, Swofford said. 
</P>
<P>
The joint action follows complaints to the Sheriff's Department about people 
living outdoors or in makeshift huts on property they don't have permission to 
use, Van Dusen said. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints have centered on unsanitary conditions at the encampments, illegal 
fires, public drunkenness, littering, fighting, drug activity and verbal 
harassment of children who pass near the camps. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ron Morse, of the sheriff's Encinitas station, said one or two complaints 
a day are received. 
</P>
<P>
"I get calls from grocery store managers about shoplifters, who, as soon as the 
back door is open, they come in and steal things," Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
But a community activist said the arrests might be in response to the city 
repealing its ban on curbside hiring a few weeks ago, just two days before a 
court hearing on a suit filed against the city over the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"Their follow-up strategy is to do the sweeps and follow up on the complaints 
of the merchants," said Roberto Martinez of the American Friends Service 
Committee, a Quaker service organization. "It's in retaliation because they 
lost the ban." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said the Sheriff's Department might have overstepped its bounds by 
working with the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dusen said it was the first joint effort by sheriff's deputies and the 
Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point where the complaints were so frequent and the problem 
escalating that it was time for the Sheriff's Department to take some larger 
action," Van Dusen said. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol officials said their agents have worked with other agencies, such 
as the San Diego Police Department and the California Highway Patrol, on the 
problem of illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"We do it all over," Swofford said. "We just cross paths all the time."

STATE CRACKS DOWN ON AVOCADO THEFT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Routine inspections at Ventura County markets and restaurants have turned up 
nearly 30,000 pounds of avocados that officials suspect were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Donella Boreham, who heads the inspection program for the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture, said inspectors in the three-county area of Ventura, 
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties issued 392 warnings to dealers of 
uncertified avocados, nearly 30% of all warnings issued in the state. 
</P>
<P>
By law, anyone who purchases or transports avocados must have a receipt proving 
where the avocados were purchased. Avocados transported without a receipt are 
presumed stolen, and inspectors can confiscate the fruit and issue a citation, 
officials said. But not all of the suspect avocados were seized. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Seelye, a spokesman for the California Avocado Commission in Santa Ana, 
said the year-old anti-theft program is part of the commission's effort to 
crack down on avocado theft rings. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado industry experts say thieves sell stolen avocados to restaurants and 
wholesale dealers. This week, avocados are fetching about $1.60 a pound, a high 
price, Seelye said. 
</P>
<P>
With a $55-million avocado crop, Ventura County ranks second in the state in 
avocado production with about 750 growers. Commission officials estimate that 
between $1 million and $2.75 million worth of avocados are stolen each year in 
the county. PSYCHE PASCUAL

2 FROM EL CAJON SURVIVE AIR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Cajon woman was injured when the experimental airplane in which she was 
flying collided with a car while making an emergency landing in Nebraska, 
authorities reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 10 p.m. CDT Sunday in western Douglas County, near the 
Missouri River. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Zeeb, 29, was treated at an Omaha hospital for minor cuts on her head, 
then released. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, James D. Newman, 35, also of El Cajon, and the driver of the car, 
Bonnie L. Stuto of Omaha, were unharmed, said Jeff Hanson, a Nebraska State 
Patrol spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, headed to Oshkosh, Wis., was an experimental, single-engine 
aircraft. It was on its way to the Experimental Aircraft Assn.'s annual 
convention, Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Newman apparently had planned to stop at Omaha's Eppley Airfield to 
refuel. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was flying east when the engine "cut out," forcing Newman to attempt 
an emergency landing on the two-lane highway in a rural area of the county. The 
plane safely landed on the highway, but then struck the back of Stuto's car, he 
said. The impact apparently caused the plane to veer off the road and into a 
ditch. 
</P>
<P>
"He picked a pretty safe place to touch down. It's a long, straight stretch of 
road. Unfortunately, there was a car on the road," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal aviation authorities could provide no additional details about the 
accident. William Stewart, manager of the Federal Aviation Administration's 
flight standards office in Lincoln, said officials would investigate the 
incident. On Monday, investigators were taking the plane to an airport in 
Wahoho, Neb., to continue their inspection.

BOND SALE TO BENEFIT INDUSTRIAL PARK OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials are moving forward with plans to sell $5 million in bonds after 
landowners overwhelmingly agreed to finance public improvements in an 
industrial park with new taxes, an official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 128-acre industrial park is the largest commercial project planned in 
Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,500 jobs may be created when it is completed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen property owners where the park will be located approved new property 
taxes in a special mail-in ballot, City Manager Roy Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure won by a 91% margin in last week's vote, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to certify the election results when it meets Aug. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the new tax gives Fillmore officials authority to issue bonds to 
raise money for road, sewer and storm drain improvements to develop the 
industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
Landowners will later be assessed to pay off the bonds.

The per-acre assessments are $655 for water lines, $787 for sewers and $2,950 
for storm drain and street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the improvements will begin in early 1991, although landowners 
will not have to pay the new taxes until a year later, Payne said. The taxes 
will be spread out over 20 years, he said.

Development of an industrial park is part of a strategy to lure new businesses 
to the town of nearly 12,000. The park is expected to change Fillmore's 
agricultural employment base to industries that generate more assembly and 
office jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial park will be located north of Old Telegraph Road on a site now 
occupied by citrus groves and a few businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Plans conceived by city officials call for an industrial park occupied by 
assembly plants, warehouses and small distribution centers. PSYCHE PASCUAL

CITY MOVES A STEP CLOSER TO POSSIBLE TRIAL IN REDISTRICTING BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: A FEDERAL JUDGE'S ACTION WAS HAILED BY A LATINO GROUP THAT HOPES TO 
OVERTURN A REDISTRICTING PLAN APPROVED IN CONCEPT BY CITY COUNCIL. 
</P>

<P>
Moving a step closer to a possible trial over San Diego's redistricting, a 
federal judge Monday indicated that a trial date could be set by late next 
month if the City Council has not resolved the bitter debate by then. 
</P>
<P>
In his two-page order, U.S. District Judge John Rhoades said that, when he 
decides at an Aug. 24 hearing whether City Council members should be compelled 
to testify about a tentatively approved redistricting map, he also could take 
several additional actions -- among them, the scheduling of a trial date on 
opponents' claims that the plan is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
As with so much else in the case, the two sides in the expanding 
political-legal dispute offered widely differing interpretations of the 
significance of Rhoades' order. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Chicano Federation of San Diego County, who hope to overturn 
the redistricting plan approved in concept by the council earlier this month, 
hailed Rhoades' decision as a crucial development that increases pressure on 
the council to seriously consider an alternative map that the Latino group 
argues better protects minority voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
But city attorneys characterized the judge's order as a routine procedural 
matter that simply underlines previously known details about possible judicial 
intervention in the event that an acceptable political solution is not found. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure it tells us anything we didn't know before," said Assistant City 
Atty. Curtis Fitzpatrick. "To the extent (Rhoades) suggests that depositions 
could be taken for the purpose of possibly going to trial -- well, what other 
purpose would there be?" 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the interpretation, several other potential legal and political 
developments could render Rhoades' order moot. If, for example, the council 
passed a redistricting proposal acceptable to the Chicano Federation by Aug. 
24, that hearing could be little more than a legal formality at which Rhoades 
would give the plan his imprimatur. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chicano Federation attorney Michael Aguirre last week asked the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to impose the alternative 
redistricting map, prepared by a council-appointed citizens' advisory 
committee, on the city. Though a hearing on that request has not yet been set, 
it, too, could alter the timetable and specifics outlined in Rhoades' Monday 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement that settled the first phase of the Chicano Federation's 
lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the city's electoral system, the 
council faces an Oct. 1 deadline for having a redistricting plan in place. 
Because of the various steps involved in the formal adoption of any city 
ordinance, the council would have to decide the matter by mid-August in order 
to meet that deadline. 
</P>
<P>
If the redistricting question were still unresolved by Aug. 24, Rhoades' 
decision on the possible depositions by council members could set other 
potential legal maneuvers -- including the scheduling of a trial date -- in 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Rhoades has resisted the Chicano Federation attorneys' request that 
council members be forced to provide sworn testimony in the case -- in 
particular, about the origins of the redistricting plan proposed by Councilman 
John Hartley, which was passed by a 5-4 vote on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
Though Rhoades has repeatedly said he would prefer to see the new configuration 
of council districts decided at City Hall rather than in a courtroom, Aguirre 
viewed Monday's order as evidence that the judge is "losing patience" with the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely positive development that moves in the direction we'd 
hoped," Aguirre said. "What it says is that, if the council doesn't do the 
right thing in the next three weeks, it may be staring at a trial date." 
</P>
<P>
Although that possibility has loomed from the case's inception, Rhoades' order 
emphasizes the potential legal consequences if the city's elected officials 
fail to settle the issue, Aguirre added. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Aguirre sees it that way, I'm not totally surprised, because we often 
disagree," City Atty. Fitzpatrick responded. "The order simply memorializes 
what we heard at the last hearing. I don't see it as very significant." 
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to resume its redistricting debate today, but with 
Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer, who voted for Hartley's plan, in Europe on 
vacation, there appears to be little chance of the council breaking the 4-4 
deadlock that developed during a hearing held in her absence last week. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many differences in the two redistricting plans before the council, 
arguably the major distinction is that Hartley's proposal would reduce the 
Latino population in the 8th District from the advisory board's proposed 52.2% 
to 51%. According to Chicano Federation attorneys, that dilution of Latino 
voting clout, combined with the manner in which the council rejected the 
advisory board's plan in favor of Hartley's proposal, violates the earlier 
legal settlement in the group's voting-rights lawsuit.

POWAY SCHOOLS OK NEW READING SERIES FOR 6TH-GRADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poway sixth-graders will learn reading and grammar this fall from textbooks 
that emphasize literature rather than rote exercises. 
</P>
<P>
The Poway Unified school board voted Monday night to adopt sixth-grade 
literature textbooks in line with those used by seventh- and eighth-grade 
students for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"The textbook we used prior to this one focused on specific decoding skills, 
grammar skills and special comprehension skills," said Leslie Fausset, 
assistant superintendent for learning support services. "The new texts give 
students a whole piece of literature with which to work, and we've found that 
all students benefit from critically analyzing and studying a text." 
</P>
<P>
The old textbooks have been in use in the district for the past 10 years. Two 
years ago the district piloted the new texts, which are published by 
Prentice-Hall, Fausset said. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh- and eighth-graders had been using similar literature-based texts since 
last year, but sixth-grade books were not available until recently, Fausset 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fausset said the new texts also incorporate examples of fine arts corresponding 
to the piece of literature the student is reading. 
</P>
<P>
"Prentice-Hall has done a magnificent job of introducing some fine arts 
components, giving background information on paintings shown and the artists 
who painted them. It really helps give the student the full picture," Fausset 
said. 
</P>
<P>
David Hughes, assistant superintendent, said the change in textbooks was in 
step with changes in the state as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"The approach in the state of California has been moved to an integrated arts 
program dealing with reading, writing and literature as a unit," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
Fausset said San Diego city schools are in their first year of adopting a 
similar textbook, but to her knowledge no other district in the county has done 
so. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with a piece of literature, working in conjunction with the literature 
enables us to integrate not only writing skills but also critical thinking 
skills," Fausset said.

Artist Eloy Torrez goes head-to-head with one of the figures in an 
as-yet-untitled mural he is painting on a building at Vesper Avenue and Victory 
Boulevard in Van Nuys. The artwork's theme is the coming together of different 
cultures to save the Earth from pollution, war and disease. The mural is one of 
15 this year by the Neighborhood Pride Project, which is sponsored by the 
Social Public Arts Resource Center under contract with the Los Angeles Cultural 
Affairs Department. Torrez, right, leans away to get perspective. He manually

DON'T ANNEX HOPE LAND, COUNCIL URGED; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: SPEAKERS TELL CITY OFFICIALS THAT DEVELOPMENT ON JORDAN RANCH PROPERTY 
WOULD INCREASE TRAFFIC AND POLLUTION IN THE REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
About 25 people from east Ventura and west Los Angeles counties spoke out 
Monday night against a proposal that Simi Valley annex 5,800 acres of 
surrounding mountain property owned by entertainer Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
The speakers told the Simi Valley City Council that a development planned on 
Hope's Jordan Ranch, southeast of the city, would increase traffic and 
pollution in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"Ventura County can't meet air quality standards as it is," said Frank Littman 
of Oak Park. "This is only going to make it worse. I moved out to Oak Park to 
get away from the urban sprawl of the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Frazho of Thousand Oaks said her city, along with Agoura and Westlake 
Village, will be more affected than Simi Valley by the planned development. 
Therefore, she said, the site "should remain under the planning jurisdiction of 
Ventura County and should not be annexed by Simi Valley." 
</P>
<P>
"This request for annexation is a desperate attempt by the developer to further 
confuse complex development issues to get approval," Frazho said. 
</P>
<P>
Only two people spoke in favor of the annexation. One of them, Gary Mueller of 
Agoura, said he favors the proposal because, under a complicated land swap, 
5,700 acres would be donated or sold for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity to gain 5,700 acres of open space outweighs the negative 
impacts of the development, Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
The council was not expected to take any action on the proposal Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 5,800 acres that would be annexed include 2,308 acres of Hope's Jordan 
Ranch and 3,495 acres in Runkle Ranch, northeast of the city. Hope and Potomac 
Investment Associates, which has an option on the Jordan Ranch, have proposed 
to build 750 residences and a golf course on 1,208 acres there. 
</P>
<P>
If annexation were approved by the Local Agency Formation Commission, the 
state-established agency that rules on annexations and incorporations, Simi 
Valley would have jurisdiction over the property and the final say over its 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Under the development proposal, the National Park Service would swap 59 acres 
of parkland needed for an access road to the subdivision, in exchange for the 
remaining 1,100 acres of Jordan Ranch. In addition, Hope is selling and 
donating 4,600 acres in the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains to park 
agencies for $10 million, considered to be a below-market price. 
</P>
<P>
The Hope proposal has been praised by some conservationists as the best deal 
possible, considering the shortage of public funds to buy parklands, but the 
plan has been denounced by critics who say that Jordan Ranch should not be 
developed because it is within the boundaries of a national recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hope's attorneys and representatives of the developer have said that 
Simi Valley stands to gain a lot if annexation is approved. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to preserving 5,700 acres of surrounding wilderness, the city would 
receive tax revenue from the Jordan Ranch development. The annexation would 
also prevent Blind Canyon, part of the Runkle Ranch property, from being sold 
to the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, which is considering the site 
for a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are a number of obstacles to annexation. The city would have to 
amend its general plan, and the environmental impact report on the housing 
development would also have to be amended. 
</P>
<P>
The processing of those actions could take up to two years, city officials have 
said.

COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY CITY CAN'T AFFORD NATIONAL PASTIME; 
</P>
<P>
LANCASTER: AT $4.7 MILLION TO BUILD AND $300,000 A YEAR TO OPERATE, EX-ANGEL 
DOUG DECINCES' PROPOSAL FOR A MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL STADIUM IS CONSIDERED TOO 
COSTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A majority of Lancaster City Council members said Monday that a proposed minor 
league baseball stadium for the city is too expensive in its current form, 
citing a consultant's estimate that the stadium would cost up to $4.7 million 
to build and $300,000 a year to operate. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford it," Councilman Arnie Rodio said in an interview. "We are not 
opposed to baseball coming to Lancaster. We will help in any way that is 
economically feasible for the city." 
</P>
<P>
The report on the stadium was released Friday by city officials. In April, the 
redevelopment agency board -- which consists of the five City Council members 
-- commissioned Economics Research Associates of Los Angeles to study the 
impact of building a municipal stadium for a minor league baseball team 
proposed by former California Angel Doug DeCinces. 
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that a 3,500-seat baseball stadium would cost the city from 
$3.6 million to $4.7 million to build and would bring the city about $100,000 
in revenues, about a third of the annual operating cost. The 3,000-seat stadium 
would draw about 100,000 patrons a year, according to the report. A statewide 
survey found that other minor league baseball teams usually play in stadiums 
built and subsidized by public money, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball stadiums should be regarded as "a quality-of-life project, like a 
theater or a park," Redevelopment Director Steve Dukett said. 
</P>
<P>
But council members said that, when the stadium was first proposed, they 
believed that the city's role would be limited to contributing land for it. The 
projected cost is excessive, according to Rodio and Councilmen George 
Theophanis and Henry Hearns, particularly given the economic demands of current 
projects, including a performing arts center under construction. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting concerned at the number of projects that are being subsidized by 
the city," Rodio said. 
</P>
<P>
"I share that same thinking," Hearns said. "However, I am in favor of us 
allowing the redevelopment agency to invest some money on a onetime basis." 
</P>
<P>
The councilmen and Rob Venneri of DeCinces' firm, DeCinces Properties, said 
they want to discuss the matter further. Venneri said he is eager to hear the 
opinions of Lancaster residents in addition to the councilmen and said the city 
involvement outlined by the report is customary for minor league franchises. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see a private individual owning a ballpark," Venneri said. "It's not a 
big moneymaker. We knew that going in. . . . If they are talking about giving 
some money and then the private sector raising the rest, that needs to be 
addressed to see if it's even a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
The stadium issue will probably go to the council members for discussion within 
the next month, Dukett said.

A Point Mugu lifeguard who was also recreation director for a Thousand Oaks 
retirement home was killed on Pacific Coast Highway Sunday morning while riding 
her bike to Oxnard with friends, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Clarke, 26, of Malibu was pronounced dead at Westlake Community Hospital 
about 8 a.m., said Officer Ed McLaughlin of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Dantio Herrera, whose Datsun swerved into the bike lane and struck Clarke from 
behind, was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Los Angeles man was being held at the Los Angeles County 
sheriff's station at Malibu in lieu of $100,000 bail, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin said Herrera attempted to flee the collision, about half a mile west 
of Decker Canyon Road in Malibu, but Clarke's bike caught under his car and 
stopped him. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke was thrown about 80 feet from her bike. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke worked as a lifeguard for the state Parks and Recreation Department and 
as recreation director for Castle Hill Retirement Village, according to a 
friend, John Weatherly. 
</P>
<P>
She was training for a triathlon in Canada next month, Weatherly said. KIRSTEN

HUSBAND CONVICTED IN CHOKING OF WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oxnard sheet-metal worker, whose wife testified that he choked her twice 
during sexual play, was found guilty Monday of first-degree attempted murder 
and use of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
A Ventura County Superior Court jury convicted Napoleon Barber, 30, of 
attempting to kill his 25-year-old wife, Michelle, despite her insistence that 
they were just "playing commando." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen M. O'Brien said that Napoleon Barber first used a 
telephone cord, then eight mitutes later, a speaker wire, to choke his wifein 
their home on the night of April 21. 
</P>
<P>
She said Michelle Barber called 911 from a pay phone on the street and 
frantically told a police dispatcher, "My husband strangled me." 
</P>
<P>
But Michelle Barber's testimony last week during her husband's trial 
contradicted what she told police. 
</P>
<P>
She dismissed audiotapes of the 911 call, saying that it had been a 
disagreement with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
She told jurors that her husband liked to choke her "when we wanted to do 
something a little more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
She said she and her husband had been "playing commando" two to three times per 
week since she introduced the practice to him eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. F. Warren Lovell, the Ventura County coroner, testified that the 
choking was so severe that it left bruises on the woman's neck and caused tiny 
blood vessels in her eyes and cheeks to burst. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said after the trial that Michelle Barber changed her story to protect 
her husband. "I think she's a battered woman and, as is common among battered 
women, they recant their stories," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charged Napoleon Barber with two counts of attempted murder in 
connection with the incident, one for using the telephone cord, and one for 
later using the speaker wire. 
</P>
<P>
While the jury convicted him for using the speaker wire, it deadlocked 11 to 1 
for conviction on whether the initial use of the telephone wire also 
constituted attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Napoleon Barber faces a sentence of life in prison with the possibility of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is scheduled Aug. 31. MACK REED

GLENN B. HALSTED; RETIRED MACHINIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glenn B. Halsted, a retired machinist who lived in Pacoima more than 30 years, 
has died. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
Halsted died of natural causes July 23, 2 1/2 years after he suffered a stroke 
that left him bedridden and paralyzed on his left side, said Edith Smith, a 
friend of Halsted's. 
</P>
<P>
Halsted was born July 17, 1924, in Richland, Wis. He served in Europe from 1943 
to 1946, winning three Bronze Stars in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
After the war he moved to Los Angeles, where he began work as an aeronautics 
machinist and soon moved to a job as a machinist for General Electric. He met 
and married Alice Mae Gross in the 1950s, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Halsted stopped working in the late 1970s, when he was seriously injured in an 
accident on the job. He suffered a stroke in February, 1987, and his wife died 
six months later, Smith said. Halsted was hospitalized with pneumonia in June, 
Smith said, and never fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Halsted had no children and no surviving family members, Smith said. Noble 
Chapel Funeral Directors in San Fernando was handling the arrangements.

FRANCES ROMIE; RETIRED PHYSICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frances Romie, a retired Canoga Park doctor who was one of the first single 
women in California to adopt a child, has died in Tarzana. She was 68. 
</P>
<P>
A general practitioner and surgeon specializing in gynecology and obstetrics, 
she delivered thousands of babies during her career, which spanned from the 
late 1950s until her retirement in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
She died Friday of cancer, said her son Leonard K. Romie. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Midland, Pa., Dr. Romie worked as a registered nurse and volunteered 
her services during World War II, which inspired her to become a doctor. She 
earned her bachelor's degree in science from UCLA in the late 1940s and 
graduated from medical school at the University of Rome in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Romie returned to the United States and opened her practice at her Canoga 
Park house. She later tore down the house and built an office on the property. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962 she adopted a son, Leonard, at time when unmarried men and women were 
not commonly selected to be adoptive parents, said a spokeswoman with the Los 
Angeles County Department of Children's Services. Four years later, she adopted 
a second son, Jerry, whom she had delivered. 
</P>
<P>
She is also survived by her brothers Anthony Romeo of Augusta, Ga., and Frank 
Romie of Oxnard; a sister, Mary Artisti of Sharpsburg, Pa.; and a grandson. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service is scheduled for 11 a.m. today at Chapel of the Oaks, Oakwood 
Memorial Park, 22601 Lassen St., Chatsworth. Burial will follow at the same 
location. Gates, Kingsley &amp; Gates Funeral Directors is handling the 
arrangements.

RAYMOND S. HILLER; RECEIVED LEGION OF MERIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raymond S. Hiller, who received the Legion of Merit for his service during 
World War II in the Polish Army, has died at his Encino home. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
He earned the award, one of the highest the United States can give to a 
foreigner, by leading several U.S. officers out of a German prison camp after 
the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, said his wife, Frances Hiller. 
</P>
<P>
Hiller, a longtime Encino resident, died Thursday of a heart attack, his wife 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Siberia, Hiller entered the Polish Army in 1939 as a first 
lieutenant. He was taken prisoner by the Soviets but managed to escape through 
Romania, Yugoslavia and Italy to France, where he joined Polish Army units 
fighting with the British. Evacuated to England from Dunkirk, he attended a 
British staff officers' school, achieved the rank of major and served as a 
Polish liaison officer to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the University of Warsaw and Oxford University, Hiller came to 
the United States in 1945. He worked for Southern California Edison from 1953 
to 1976. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 41 years and a brother, Henry Hiller of Encino. 
Visitation is scheduled for tonight from 5 to 8 at Pierce Brothers Praiswater 
Canoga Park Mortuary, 7245 Remmet Ave., Canoga Park, which is handling the 
arrangements. A rosary will be recited at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, and a Mass will 
be celebrated at 10 a.m. Wednesday, both at Our Lady of the Bright Mount Polish 
Catholic Church, 3424 W. Adams Blvd. in Los Angeles. Burial will follow at Holy 
Cross Cemetery in Los Angeles. Contributions can be made in Hiller's name to 
the charity of the donor's choice.

NASA'S CONTINUING PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article is generally correct in its assessment that "Shuttle fixation lies 
at the heart of NASA's bureaucratic miasma." 
</P>
<P>
However, Easterbrook is incorrect in suggesting that U.S. scientists have been 
remiss, compared to scientists in the Soviet Union, by failing to criticize the 
Space Shuttle as impractical. 
</P>
<P>
I was a member of the National Academy of Sciences' Space Sciences Board in 
1972 and in 1986, and know that the strong consensus expressed at both times 
was that the Space Shuttle was an inefficient means to do science compared to 
expendable launch vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The reason why this consensus of space scientists is not often heard is because 
scientists are human, and don't take much satisfaction in talking to a brick 
wall. Scientists in the United States have much less prestige and influence 
than those in the Soviet Union due to a variety of factors, most important 
being the relative power of other institutions, particularly the press and 
industry.

Re: "Anti-Abortion Protesters Get Terms Up to 215 Days," (Metro, July 17) 
</P>
<P>
Can anyone seriously doubt that we are witnessing judicial tyranny? Who in his 
right mind would not be aghast at a seven-month jail term for misdemeanor 
trespassing? 
</P>
<P>
It seems the only minority that can be persecuted with impunity are vocal 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, jail terms for first- offense trespassers have become common. 
This is a violation of both justice and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that there isn't a national uproar over the unjust and tyrannical 
oppression of these conscientious people tells me that as a nation we don't 
want to face the reality of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Those who call our attention to this national disgrace deserve the same respect 
and legal protection that the civil rights protesters gained in the '60s.

STATE GIVES PERMISSION TO BUDDHIST TEMPLE TO GRANT ACADEMIC DEGREES; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: BUDDHIST LEADERS WANT TO PROMOTE A CULTURAL EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE 
EAST AND WEST AND CONTRIBUTE TO WORLD PEACE.

<P>
Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, the largest Buddhist monastery in the 
Western Hemisphere, will begin offering bachelor's and master's degrees next 
year, becoming one of a handful of Buddhist organizations licensed by the state 
to confer college degrees. 
</P>
<P>
State education officials earlier this month gave permission to the 2-year-old 
temple to open a private school that will grant bachelor's degrees in Buddhist 
studies and master's degrees in religious studies. The temple is a branch of Fo 
Kuang Shan, Taiwan's largest Buddhist organization. 
</P>
<P>
The school will open next spring with from 50 to 100 students, 10 faculty 
members, and a handful of advisers, said Venerable Yung Kai, a nun at the 
temple who is serving as acting academic affairs officer. 
</P>
<P>
It will be run out of the Hacienda Heights temple at first. Eventually, the 
Buddhists plan to open a full-fledged university at another location that will 
teach a wider range of subjects, including philosophy, business management and 
humanities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Through teachings, which will be in English, the Buddhist leaders want to 
promote "a cultural exchange between the East and West," Yung Kai said. 
"Hopefully, we will contribute to world peace." 
</P>
<P>
The United States was not the first choice of temple officials. Originally, 
they wanted the school close to the Fo Kuang Shan temple in Taiwan, which is 10 
times the size of the Hacienda Heights temple. But that idea met with 
resistance from the Taiwanese government, which Yung Kai termed "very 
restrictive" when it comes to licensing colleges run by religious 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
There are Buddhist colleges in Taiwan, but none are government-approved, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So after the Hacienda Heights temple opened in 1988, the Venerable Hsing Yun, 
Fo Kuang Shan's leader, turned his attention from Taiwan to Southern 
California. The area is a prime location for a university campus, Yung Kai 
said, because it can draw on the expertise of American Buddhist scholars. 
</P>
<P>
One such scholar is Lewis Lancaster, a UC Berkeley professor in the department 
of Oriental languages who is serving as an adviser to Hsi Lai Temple. He said 
he may teach at the new school as a visiting lecturer. Lancaster also is 
heading a Fo Kuang Shan project to record Buddhist scriptures on compact disc 
so they can be viewed on a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster said that although a Buddhist college here is akin to Catholic or 
Protestant schools in China, it may seem strange to Americans that "a Buddhist 
group comes into our environment and offers this kind of instruction. I think 
it's wonderful. It's time for all of us to realize we do live in a global 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Hsi Lai Temple, with its glistening tile roofs, traditional Chinese 
pagoda-style architecture and towering, brightly painted statues, has become 
something of an American tourist attraction as well as a solemn retreat for the 
East San Gabriel Valley's burgeoning Asian population. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-building, 15-acre complex is one of about 50 temples that Fo Kuang Shan 
owns around the world. The Buddhist organization is planning to break ground 
soon on another temple in Sydney, Australia.

THINKING THE UNTHINKABLE;

<P>
YES, U.S. INTERVENTION IN LIBERIA MAY BE THE BEST HUMANITARIAN MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The horrifying massacre of at least 600 refugees, including women and small 
children who had taken refuge in a Monrovia church, is confirmation that 
Liberia stands on the brink of anarchy. The European Community's ambassadors 
have characterized the situation as "national suicide." 
</P>
<P>
The killings occurred Sunday, and were carried out by troops loyal to the 
tottering Liberian strongman Samuel Doe. His control of the country, which at 
present is being contested by insurgents directed by two feuding rebel leaders, 
now is restricted to portions of the capital. Unfortunately, the Lutheran 
church in which some 2,000 Liberians had taken refuge from the fighting was 
within that zone of control. According to witnesses, soldiers from Doe's Krahn 
tribe burst into the church and turned automatic weapons, knives and swords 
against the civilians, who were members of the Gio and Mano tribes. Liberia was 
founded in 1847 by freed American slaves, but tribalism remains a strong and 
divisive force. 
</P>
<P>
Doe denied that the atrocities were perpetrated by his troops. Monday 
afternoon, however, the U.S. State Department said that it was convinced that 
government soldiers were responsible. A department spokesman said American 
officials would be "discussing this with the government." 
</P>
<P>
They may have to do more than that. A U.S. naval task force with 2,000 Marines 
aboard is cruising off the Liberian coast. Monday, both the White House and the 
State Deparment were quick to say that no intervention was contemplated "at 
this point." 
</P>
<P>
This point, however, may very quickly give way to a worse one. Recent history 
is replete with examples -- not only African -- in which the breakdown of civil 
order gives way to murderous tribal strife. 
</P>
<P>
One of the rebel leaders, Prince Yormie Johnson, already has appealed for 
intervention by the Marines. Washington is understandably reluctant to comply. 
But distasteful as such a step might be, its difficulties are outweighed by 
America's historical and human obligations to the people of the only other 
country in the world in whose founding we had a direct hand.

WIND BECOMES A DIRTY WORD FOR HIGH DESERT HOMEOWNERS; 
</P>
<P>
ANTELOPE VALLEY: DRY CONDITIONS, FEWER CROPS AND THE CLEARING OF LAND FOR 
CONSTRUCTION HAVE KICKED UP CLOUDS OF DUST ALONG WITH RESIDENTS' IRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Carolyn Kott and many of her neighbors on the east side of Palmdale feel like 
they're fighting a losing battle. The enemy is dirt, and they say they can't 
seem to keep it out of their homes, off their cars or from muddying their 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since developers several months ago stripped the vegetation from several 
large lots nearby, residents in the Antelope Valley neighborhood say they have 
had to live with clouds of dirt blown by the high desert's winds. Housecleaning 
has become virtually futile. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just gotten so disgusted," said Kott, standing with her husband on their 
dirt-covered back-yard patio. "It doesn't do any good. I'll clean this up, and 
it will be like this again in a few days. You just can't seem to keep ahead of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Although severe, the problems in Kott's Palmdale neighborhood are hardly 
unique. Few places or people in the high desert this year have escaped being 
blanketed by the onslaught of dirt and sand that residents say is the worst 
they have seen in decades. 
</P>
<P>
Blustery winds are nothing new to the high desert, but this year they have 
combined with a record fourth year of drought, a decline in the amount of 
acreage devoted to crops and the clearing of land for development to strip the 
soil from the valley. 
</P>
<P>
This past week, the South Coast Air Quality Management District conducted a 
public hearing about the desert's dust problems and decided to extend for 
another 18 months its monitoring of air quality in the area. AQMD officials 
said, however, that the amount of dust in the Antelope Valley's air does not 
exceed federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the 40 valley residents who attended the meeting disagreed with that 
sanguine assessment and said the experts' monitoring techniques have failed to 
detect the seriousness of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In developed parts of the valley, where other structures or landscaping offer 
some protection from the wind and dirt, residents still have been forced to 
cover their pools and cars, and weatherproof their houses. Contact lens wearers 
have suffered from irritated and watery eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In areas exposed to the open desert or near construction sites, the problems 
have been more severe, forcing people indoors and covering their houses, 
furniture and floors with a layer of fine-grained dust and sand. For some, it 
has caused health problems to worsen. And for almost everyone, it's meant a lot 
of cleaning up. 
</P>
<P>
"The dirt gets on the sidewalks and the entrance way, and all over the house," 
said George Greene, a retired Lancaster aerospace engineer who blames 
developers for the severity of the dust problems and officials in Lancaster and 
Palmdale for failing to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The worst conditions have arisen near the rapidly growing area's many 
construction sites, where the ground cover has been removed and loose dirt is 
piled next to excavations. Residents say their complaints, however, aren't 
bringing any action. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley's two largest cities, Lancaster and Palmdale, have 
ordinances requiring construction sites to be dampened with water to control 
dirt and dust. But residents say the cities are slow to respond to complaints, 
and watering is, at best, a temporary solution. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they and developers do what they can but admit it's 
difficult. "Out here, trying to keep dust down in heavy winds is impossible. 
It's a fact of life unless you stop all of the construction" or plant grass 
everywhere, said Roy Stilson, a Palmdale public works inspector. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some city and construction industry officials complain that another 
cause of the sandstorms has been animals that destroy vegetation by overgrazing 
vast areas of rangeland in the far west Antelope Valley. Occasionally powerful 
westerly winds then sweep up the dirt and deposit it miles away on city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The drought also has been a major factor, leaving the region bone-dry and 
choking off desert vegetation that might otherwise have kept the topsoil in 
place. As a result, large sections of the valley have become virtual sand 
dunes. 
</P>
<P>
The same phenomena also have occurred this year in other Southern California 
desert areas. Because of unusually strong winds and dry conditions, heaps of 
blowing sand have closed roads and frustrated residents in the Riverside County 
communities of Palm Desert, Cathedral City and Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Already this year in the Antelope Valley, at least half a dozen windstorms with 
gusts up to 60 m.p.h. have raised towering clouds of sand and dirt and reduced 
visibility in some places to near zero, causing dozens of traffic collisions. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions have also alarmed officials at Palmdale's commercial airport and 
the area's two military airports, Plant 42 in Palmdale and Edwards Air Force 
Base to the north. Officials there fear the blowing dirt could interfere with 
flight and testing activities. 
</P>
<P>
Large sandstorms have swept over the entire valley sporadically this year. But 
localized dust problems have occurred far more frequently near construction 
sites where even average-strength winds can pick up dirt exposed by 
excavations. Although smaller in scale, the dirt problems near construction 
sites can be intense, with mini-sand dunes piling up almost over night on front 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Wells said she knew nothing about such phenomena when she and her husband 
moved from the South Bay to buy their first home in Lancaster about 1 1/2 years 
ago. The young couple picked a house built across from a vacant lot and soon 
discovered open spaces aren't always an amenity. 
</P>
<P>
Dirt kicked up by a house builder on that property enveloped the neighborhood 
and forced the family to spend thousands of dollars to seal windows, replace 
carpeting and drapes and even repaint their new home's sandblasted exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Wellses and 10 other families were each awarded $1,850 in what 
Lancaster officials said was the first criminal case in the region in which a 
developer had been ordered to pay homeowners for damages caused by blowing 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Harold Smith of the Costa Mesa-based Rialto Development Co. pleaded no 
contest to one misdemeanor count under the city's ordinance and was ordered to 
begin paying each of the families in $100-a-month installments. But Wells said 
the families have yet to receive any of the money. 
</P>
<P>
In Kott's neighborhood in Palmdale, meanwhile, some residents are talking about 
gathering signatures on a petition spelling out their complaints that they 
would then present to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Kott said the blowing dirt and sand have worsened her husband's emphysema. 
Nearby resident Sylvia Williams said her family soon is going to have their 
pool redone for the second time in two years because sand has damaged the 
surface. Their plants seem to be suffering from the dirt as well. 
</P>
<P>
And neighbor Mary Massarella, a 26-year resident of the area, said she's almost 
given up on cleaning her house, which is downwind of several construction 
sites. "It's gotten to the point where I'm tired of fighting it," she said. "I 
don't even walk barefoot in the house anymore."

SOVIETS: BEFORE WE CELEBRATE THE COLLAPSE OF THE EMPIRE, WE SHOULD RECALL 
HISTORY AND THE MISCHIEF OF PARIAH STATES.

<P>
The Ukrainian republic's mid-July declaration of independence is but one of 
several recent events portending the eventual political and military 
dissolution of the Soviet Union. Some American conservatives do not conceal 
their glee over the prospect of the Soviet Union's balkanization and abasement, 
which they regard as the logical and just culminating acts of America's victory 
in the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
But this collapse is fraught with peril. Those who wish it betray an ignorance 
of what history can tell us about the potential consequences of such a collapse 
as well as a shortsighted appreciation of America's long-term security 
interests in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Large, multinational empires held together by naked military force have rarely 
departed the world stage quietly. In almost all cases they have succumbed 
through violence -- revolutionary, civil or foreign. We should remember that 
World War I originated in the death rattle of a decayed Austro-Hungarian 
Empire. In fact, as strongly suggested in recent events in Eastern Europe -- 
the revival of irredentism in Yugoslavia, mounting Hungarian-Romanian 
antagonism and Moldavian longing to rejoin Romania, just to name a few -- the 
issues that contributed to the Hapsburg Empire's demise have still not been 
resolved to the lasting satisfaction of its successor states. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, any kind of civil war in the Soviet Union, to say nothing of one of 
the magnitude that ravaged the country from 1917 to 1922 (and claimed an 
estimated 20 million lives), would be the first such conflict to take place in 
a nuclear-armed state. This raises the prospect of unauthorized use of nuclear 
weapons by warring factors. 
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging that Moscow has already taken care to evacuate nuclear 
weapons from regions that have been the scene of violent strife. But the 
specter of accidental or deliberate use of such weapons, and the possibility 
that their use could be misinterpreted as a foreign attack, could not be 
dismissed in the event of a full-scale civil war that divided the loyalties of 
the Soviet army. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the thoughtful chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, has properly raised this issue. "What would each side do," he asked 
in a recent speech, "if there were an unexplained detonation at a site in the 
Soviet Union? Who would the Soviets suspect, and how would they react?" 
</P>
<P>
But let us assume for the sake of argument that the Soviet Union disintegrates 
without a shot being fired by anyone. Would our long-term security interests be 
served by a vacuum of power, including military power, east of the Oder-Neisse? 
</P>
<P>
For centuries, Russian and, later, Soviet military power, when not used to 
further Moscow's own territorial ambitions in Europe, served as an 
indispensable counterweight to the hegemonic ambitions of other European 
states. Both Napoleon's and Hitler's attempts to conquer all of Europe met 
their ruination on the steppes of Russia. Indeed, absent Hitler's strategically 
insane decision to invade the Soviet Union in 1941, it is doubtful whether even 
the combined might of the United States and the British Empire could have 
succeeded in gaining a military foothold in Normandy, to say nothing of 
clearing German forces from the rest of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
For most of this century, our enduring and overriding objective in Europe has 
been to prevent the Continent's domination by a single power. It was to secure 
this interest that we declared war on Imperial Germany in 1917 and again on 
Nazi Germany in 1941. And it was to secure this interest against Europe's 
threatened domination by the Soviet Union that we abandoned more than a century 
of isolationist foreign policy in the late 1940s and entered into an 
"entangling" military alliance with most of Europe's non-communist states. 
</P>
<P>
Today we face a challenge that has long bedeviled European emperors, kings, 
prime ministers and presidents: Now that yet another (albeit cold) war has been 
won, how is an enduring peace to be fashioned? 
</P>
<P>
Historians have learned a few things from centuries of peacemaking in Europe. 
Because peace treaties must resolve -- or try to resolve -- the causes of war, 
settlements that protect the core security interests of the vanquished (as the 
1815 Congress of Vienna did for France) have proven more stable over time than 
those seeking revenge (as did the 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk against Russia, 
and the 1919 Treaty of Versailles against Germany). 
</P>
<P>
Punitive treaties have, without exception, caused more problems than they 
solved. They create pariah states. And there is nothing more dangerous to 
international stability than a pariah state. Defeat, demoralization and, above 
all, humiliation breed resentment and revanchism. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and its Western allies face a critical choice in the event of 
the Soviet Union's disintegration. We can stand back, watch it happen and do 
nothing to cushion it, crowing all the while about the justness and 
completeness of our "victory." In this case, however, we have to pray that a 
humiliated and outcast Soviet Union, or some lesser Russian entity, does not 
arise from its ashes (something that defeated pariahs, like post-Versailles 
Germany and post-Brest-Litovsk Russia, have demonstrated an annoying tendency 
to do); and that if it did, it would not seek (as did Nazi Germany) to "set 
things right." 
</P>
<P>
The other choice is for the West to refrain from victory celebrations and to 
encourage -- via reassuring political and arms-control agreements and economic 
and technical assistance -- the integration of the Soviet Union's successor 
states into the community of responsible nations. This choice holds the most 
promise of what, after all, have been the declared "war" aims of the United 
States in conflicts hot and cold since President Franklin D. Roosevelt and 
Prime Minister Winston Churchill proclaimed the Atlantic Charter almost 50 
years ago: "to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who 
have been forcibly deprived of them" and to "encourage all other practicable 
measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of 
armaments." 
</P>
<P>
History has shown that, in victory, magnanimity makes for far more intelligent 
statecraft than lust for revenge.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
RECESSION IS ANOTHER STATE OF MIND; 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA'S CHALLENGE WON'T BE FENDING OFF STAGNATION, BUT MANAGING PROBLEMS 
OF PHENOMENAL GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

economist at the Bank of America and a professor in the School of Business 
Administration and the Graduate School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley.

<TEXT>
<P>
The rolling recession hit first in Texas, where real-estate values plunged and 
financial institutions faced bankruptcy. It was a recession caused by inflated 
housing prices, overbuilding in commercial and industrial real estate and a 
collapse in energy prices. This recession rolled across Texas into Arizona, 
Colorado, Oklahoma and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
It then leapfrogged from the Southwest to the Northeast, where the 
"Massachusetts Miracle" turned into an economic disaster. Again, real-estate 
values in Boston and surrounding environs collapsed, financial institutions 
went into bankruptcy and high-tech unemployment became a fact of life. The 
recession quickly rolled down the East Coast and inundated New York. Thousands 
of investment bankers, financial analysts, stock brokers and other assorted 
Wall Street workers were suddenly without jobs. And now the recession has 
rolled into the nation's capital. The Washington region is confronting 
something that no one in that area thought possible: Housing values are 
declining, jobs are becoming scarce and defense cutbacks loom. 
</P>
<P>
Now, we Californians are being told that our time has come. Housing is 
overpriced. Both commercial and industrial real estate are overbuilt. High-tech 
industries cannot compete with the Japanese. And, we are told, as the largest 
defense-spending state in the nation -- $50 billion out of a total defense 
budget of $300 billion -- we are especially vulnerable to defense cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
How does a Californian respond? Are we vulnerable to the rolling recession? We 
begin by noting the conditions that must prevail for a recession to occur in a 
regional economy such as California: The economy must be narrowly based, such 
as energy in Texas, finance in New York or government employment and contracts 
in Washington; the population growth of the region must stagnate so that the 
potential demand for housing evaporates, and employment and income growth must 
slow so that the economy goes into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The California economy is the largest in the United States, and diverse. 
Furthermore, it is diverse in just those areas that are expected to grow. 
According to the latest government projections on employment for the next 
decade, the industries expected to show the strongest growth are services, 
retail trade and agribusiness. The industries expected to grow more slowly 
include construction, manufacturing (especially automobiles), transportation, 
public utilities, wholesale trade and government. California is far more 
concentrated in the higher growth than in the slower growth industries, with 
two notable exceptions -- construction and defense. The growth in population in 
California over the past decade has been nothing less than phenomenal. A total 
of 5.4 million people have moved into the state since 1980, an increase of 
22.8%. New York, by comparison, added only 392,000 to its population, a 2.2% 
increase. To a large extent, it has been this increase in population in 
California that has created our current housing problems. We simply could not 
build housing fast enough to satisfy the demand, and so housing prices rose 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
What about the future? Again, the latest government projections indicate that 
we will add 4.2 million people by the end of the 1990s. This means that the 
housing demand will continue to grow. The labor force will continue to expand. 
The pressures on our transportation and utility systems, schools, water 
supplies and land use will continue to mount. 
</P>
<P>
California is expected to be one of the strongest states in terms of employment 
and personal income growth over the next decade. The growth in nonfarm 
employment is projected to average 1.7% each year, well above the 1.2% average 
growth expected for the nation as a whole. The same is true for personal 
income, which is expected to grow an average of 2.4% each year compared to the 
national average of 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Whether we realize this potential or not will depend upon two major factors. 
First, will the California economy be overwhelmed in the near term by a 
collapse in housing prices and defense cutbacks? Second, will California have 
the political will over the longer term to deal with the mounting problems 
associated with our rapid population growth? 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a home in California is $196,000. It is also a fact that 
median prices in the Sacramento area ($129,000), the Central Valley ($108,000) 
and Riverside-San Bernardino ($130,000) are far lower. Homes in these areas are 
very affordable by California standards. Therefore, it is no surprise that some 
of the strongest housing markets in the country are in California. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that California is going through another housing cycle. We 
have been through these in the past, the most notable being the period from 
1979 through 1982. It is a period in which the areas of highest-priced housing 
(Los Angeles, Orange County, San Francisco), can expect no significant 
appreciation in housing values for several years. Areas of lower-priced housing 
can anticipate continued in-migration and housing pressures. The important 
point is that growth is continuing in both population and employment, and this 
will prevent a collapse in housing prices similar to what has been experienced 
in other parts of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Given the current defense outlook, we can anticipate a loss of about 40,000 
defense-related jobs each year from now until around 1995. But California will 
also be adding an average of 300,000 new jobs each year. Admittedly, many of 
these new jobs will be in lower-paying service areas. But the important point 
is that the California economy will not be devastated by defense cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the rolling recession that we need fear. California's situation is 
far different from that of Texas, Boston, New York or Washington. What we must 
be concerned about is how we are going to respond to the needs of our rapidly 
growing population. Our future will be told in our willingness to make the 
necessary investments in our basic infrastructure: education, highways, public 
transportation, water and land use. Our problems are those associated with 
growth, not those of a stagnant economy on the verge of a recession.

NIBBLE AT FREEDOM, AND RISK LOSING IT ALL; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST AMENDMENT: TOOLS DRAGGED OUT TO STIFLE HATEFUL SPEECH WOULD DISTURB 
BEDROCK PRINCIPLES OF FREE EXPRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRVING R. KAUFMAN, Irving R. Kaufman is a judge of the U.S. 2nd Circuit 
Court of Appeals, where he has served as chief judge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American doctrine of free expression, as embodied in the First Amendment, 
is undergoing a re-examination. For confirmation of this phenomenon, one need 
not look beyond the newspaper headlines. Universities have proposed and adopted 
regulations that punish students for racist remarks, legislatures have 
attempted to outlaw flag-burning and the National Endowment for the Arts has 
restricted grants to artists whose work may be deemed offensive or obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly bold and offensive examples of speech have captured the nation's 
attention and sparked public impatience with the status quo. A sharp rise in 
racist incidents has led some universities to adopt codes punishing hostile 
discourse. Stanford University recently became the latest to forbid verbal, 
written or symbolic attacks against individuals "on the basis of their sex, 
race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or national or ethnic 
origin." To the outrage of some civil-libertarians, the three California 
affiliates of the ACLU have adopted resolutions approving these regulations. 
</P>
<P>
A growing group of legal scholars who claim that it is possible to carve out 
exceptions to traditional free-speech doctrine without disturbing bedrock 
principles have added intellectual support to the public outrage. Proponents of 
these restrictions argue that racial insults act as "assault weapons" and 
undercut the First Amendment goal of robust debate by chilling minority 
commentary. The net result of outlawing some speech, this thinking goes, will 
be more (and more diverse) speech. 
</P>
<P>
The defenders of these limitations, however, suffer from a lack of historical 
perspective. Their argument, that we can adjust our concept of free speech for 
the occasion, has often been employed as a justification for speech 
restrictions and has repeatedly been rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Explained Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: "If there is any principle of the 
Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is 
the principle of free thought -- not free thought for those who agree with us, 
but freedom for thought that we hate." 
</P>
<P>
Let us not forget that the First Amendment serves to protect the minority 
against majoritarian impulses to suppress the airing of unpopular views. 
Although the inclination to repress statements most of us find abhorrent is 
understandable, placing censorship decisions in the hands of the most vocal or 
politically powerful is antithetical to the aims of the First Amendment. It is 
unfortunate, but it seems that every generation must relearn the lesson that we 
cannot forbid particular forms of expression without running the risk of 
suppressing important ideas in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of restrictions argue that permitting bans on some "hate speech" 
requires us to ban all such speech. This objection has merit. At the very 
least, it is difficult to comprehend how universities, legislatures and 
ultimately courts will be able to root out offensive speech in any acceptable, 
neutral manner. How does one distinguish the anger felt by many Southerners 
when civil-rights activists criticized their ways and the injury caused by the 
emotionally charged language that surrounds the abortion debate from other 
hateful and hurtful statements that some propose to ban? 
</P>
<P>
Censorship of this type threatens our uneasy consensus regarding the protected 
nature of speech content. Once the courts accept the notion that they have a 
right to slice away discrete areas of expression from First Amendment 
protection, much of the amendment's central role may be lost because almost no 
form of speech will be beyond legislative reach. 
</P>
<P>
Although many groups have understandably grown impatient with the 
intractability of some of the sexist and racist behavior that constantly 
confronts them, the answer does not lie in suppressing the views of their 
adversaries. There is great danger that tools used benevolently today will be 
employed as instruments of destruction tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, there is a need for vigorous action to combat racial and other forms 
of discrimination. But curbing First Amendment freedoms is the wrong way to 
achieve this goal. Justice Holmes explained and history has taught us, in the 
long run, the best answer to "bad" speech is more and better speech, not new 
laws, litigation and repression. The refusal to suppress offensive speech is 
one of the most difficult obligations that the free-speech principle imposes 
upon us all; but the First Amendment requires no less. It has defined our 
country for almost 200 years. We must avoid nibbling at it.

STEINBRENNER IS ORDERED TO QUIT; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: VINCENT RULES THAT HE MUST RESIGN AS GENERAL PARTNER OF YANKEES BY 
AUG. 20 FOR MAKING $40,000 PAYMENT TO GAMBLER.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Steinbrenner's turbulent reign as New York Yankee owner all but ended 
Monday when Commissioner Fay Vincent forced him to give up control of the team 
for paying a gambler for information about outfielder Dave Winfield, now of the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Steinbrenner will have no further involvement in the management of the New 
York Yankees or in the day-to-day operations of that club," Vincent said in 
announcing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after a daylong meeting in the commissioner's office and was 
the result of a four-month investigation into Steinbrenner's $40,000 payment to 
Howard Spira. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner must resign as general partner by Aug. 20, when someone will be 
appointed to take his place, subject to the approval of Vincent and the other 
major league teams. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, 60, will be allowed to consult on major business decisions 
involving the Yankees, but cannot participate in player deals. He must also ask 
Vincent's permission to attend games. 
</P>
<P>
"For all purposes, Mr. Steinbrenner agrees that he is to be treated as if he 
had been placed on the permanent ineligible list," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner also agreed not to contest the decision in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not comment on the decision," Steinbrenner said. "I'm very happy it was 
resolved. I'm very satisfied with the resolution, and that's all I'm going to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
As one baseball's more fiery characters, Steinbrenner was famous for his hiring 
and firing of managers, particularly the late Billy Martin, and for feuding 
with his players, including Reggie Jackson and Winfield. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner is the only owner to be penalized twice for major offenses. He was 
suspended in 1974 by Bowie Kuhn for making illegal campaign contributions to 
President Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
"I am able to evaluate a pattern of behavior that borders on the bizarre," 
Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent to me that Mr. Steinbrenner does not appreciate the gravity of 
his conduct," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In short, I must get the attention of this owner. He must learn to be more 
careful, to listen to his advisers, and to consider more carefully all the 
ramifications of his conduct. It is my sincere hope that the sanctions . . . 
will have the result I intend. If they do not, I or my successor will be 
confronting Mr. Steinbrenner once again. And that cannot be in the best 
interest of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The news spread quickly through Yankee Stadium, where New York played Detroit, 
and fans greeted the announcement with a 90-second standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pete Peterson, Yankee general manager: "I'm absolutely shocked at the 
severity and all I can tell you is I feel very sad at this moment. The man has 
his faults, but he has done a lot of good things. He's done a lot for baseball 
and especially for baseball in New York for the Yankees. He was the type of 
competitor that this town could really appreciate." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent disciplined Steinbrenner for violating Rule 21, otherwise known as the 
"best interests of baseball" clause. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation centered on Steinbrenner's $40,000 payment to Spira, a 
self-described gambler and a former employee of the David M. Winfield 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner testified before Vincent July 5-6 and gave various reasons for the 
payment. Among them were that he was afraid Spira would attack his family, that 
he gave Spira the money "out of the goodness of my heart" and that he wanted to 
protect two former Yankees employees from embarrassing revelations. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this sad episode is now over," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second consecutive summer baseball penalized one of its more 
famous figures. Last August, Pete Rose was banned for life for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's 18-year tenure as principal owner of the Yankees has been 
peppered with disciplinary action by the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
He has been fined several times, the most recently on July 5 when Vincent 
docked him $25,000 for tampering with Winfield in the days after his May 11 
trade to California. The Yankees also were ordered to pay the Angels $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 27, 1974, Kuhn suspended Steinbrenner for two years following his 
guilty plea to felony violations of the federal election law. Steinbrenner was 
reinstated on March 1, 1976, for good behavior, but former Yankees employees 
have said recently that Steinbrenner violated terms of that suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said he asked Steinbrenner to reduce his interest to below 50 percent 
within the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
"The new general partner does not have to own more than Mr. Steinbrenner," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said Steinbrenner can only sell to a family member with the 
commissioner's approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't ruled out his son as a general partner, but we have imposed very 
severe restrictions on any family member involved with the team. If a family 
member was found to deal with Mr. Steinbrenner, he could be expelled from 
baseball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spira is under federal indictment on charges he tried to extort money from 
Steinbrenner and threatened the owner and Winfield. Spira has pleaded not 
guilty, and a trial is expected later this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision is largely the result of admitted conduct by Mr. Steinbrenner, 
although there is ample evidence from other sources supporting the conclusion I 
have reached," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some may argue that nothing very serious is involved in this case; that Mr. 
Steinbrenner erred, but not egregiously; that there are worse problems in 
baseball and that these errors do not merit a strong punitive response. I 
strongly disagree. I sat through the two days of Mr. Steinbrenner's testimony 
and I am able to judge the degree of candor and contrition present in this 
case. I am able to discern an attempt to force explanations in hindsight onto 
discomforting facts . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Steinbrenner knew that the payment to Spira was ill-advised because all 
his advisers spoke against it. He knew Spira was or had been a gambler -- it 
matters not which -- and yet he made the payment. He knew Spira claimed he had 
been promised money or a job or both, and yet Mr. Steinbrenner made the 
payment, thereby validating the claims that Spira was being paid for providing 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew the payment, if exposed, would look bad and he knew, or at least 
should have known, that if the payment were exposed, it would bring disrepute 
to him and therefore to baseball. As a result, efforts were made to cover it 
up."

TWINS' COMEBACK BEATS ANGELS' COMEBACK, 7-3 
</P>

<P>
The Angels' present to Doug Rader on their manager's 46th birthday was to slide 
a notch lower in the American League West standings and teeter within a game of 
last place. 
</P>
<P>
It was an unhappy return to a low point they last hit on May 22, a frustrating 
night fraught with snuffed opportunities instead of snuffed candles. Rallying 
once in support of starter Bert Blyleven proved insufficient Monday. The Twins 
matched a three-run Angel flurry in the top of the seventh with three in the 
bottom of the inning against Blyleven and Mark Eichhorn and took fifth place 
with a 7-3 victory at the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
"You're one run down at 4-3 and all of a sudden, we've got four runs we've got 
to make up. That's tough to do twice, especially late in the game," first 
baseman Lee Stevens said. "The big inning kills us. It was a good sign that we 
came back, that we didn't give up, but when it was 4-3, they beat us to the 
bigger inning." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota took the lead in the second inning on a leadoff home run by Gary 
Gaetti, the first of his four RBIs. A single by Brian Harper -- extending his 
hitting streak to a league-best 20 games -- and an error by shortstop Donnie 
Hill on Randy Bush's fielder's choice grounder put runners on first and third 
with two out, a jam Blyleven escaped via a strikeout and a grounder. 
</P>
<P>
But he couldn't dodge disaster in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old right-hander was hit hard in the sixth, giving up three runs 
after yielding singles to four of the first five hitters. He lasted 6 2/3 
innings and was charged with six runs, inflating his earned-run average to 
5.47. Over his last seven starts, Blyleven has allowed 34 earned runs in 34 
innings. He's 1-3 with three no-decisions in that span. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven studiously reviewed game films with pitching coach Marcel Lachemann. 
Despite the live and taped evidence, Rader insisted Blyleven had pitched "a 
tremendous game," a game Rader said hinged on Kirby Puckett's single to left 
field in the sixth inning, and Gaetti snaring a line drive by Brian Downing in 
the seventh with three runs in and a runner on second. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to one ball settled and one ball didn't," Rader said. "There 
wasn't a single thing wrong with what Bert did tonight. . . . The fact is that 
Bert kept us in a position to win, and that's the obligation of a starting 
pitcher. Brian hits the daylights out of the ball and it's caught, and Kirby 
flips one and it falls in." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' seventh-inning rally against Kevin Tapani (11-5) began when Dave 
Winfield singled to right field and moved to second on Johnny Ray's single to 
left. Both scored on Donnie Hill's triple to right-center, a drive that 
ricocheted off the padding above the right-field fence.

Hill scored when Kent Anderson lined a double off the plexiglass barrier atop 
the left-field fence. Tapani was relieved by Terry Leach, who quashed the 
Angels' hopes when he got Downing to line to third. 
</P>
<P>
"We scored three with two outs and got back in the game," Anderson said, "but 
they went out and did what a team is supposed to do. You've got to give them 
credit. We should be scoring more runs. We're hitting the ball well but to 
people. That happens when things aren't going well." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Despite increasing speculation that he is about to be named manager of the St. 
Louis Cardinals, Angel broadcaster Joe Torre said he had not been made an 
offer. However, he said he had talked with Cardinal General Manager Dal Maxvill 
Monday and believes he is still a prime candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"We were discussing numbers -- more than numbers, details," said Torre, who 
last managed in Atlanta in 1984. "They're getting serious. But I have no way of 
knowing they're not doing the same thing with anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Torre, who said he'd heard the Cards were "very impressed" with Milwaukee 
Brewer hitting instructor Don Baylor, said the chief attractions of the job 
were managing in the city where he enjoyed some of his finest years and the 
chance to work with a friend such as Maxvill rather than for a boss. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner (fractured kneecap) and Chili Davis (lower back strain) were 
examined by team physician Lewis Yocum Monday at Centinela Hospital in 
Inglewood. Joyner was described as improving and Davis as progressing. Both are 
eligible to be activated off the disabled list but neither is expected to be 
activated in the immediate future.

MORGAN'S TWO-HITTER BEATS CINCINNATI, 4-1; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: DODGERS GET FIFTH CONSECUTIVE VICTORY IN DEALING THE REDS' THEIR 
EIGHTH LOSS IN A ROW. 
</P>

A pennant race returned to Dodger Stadium Monday on the sleeves of a hustling, 
free-swinging, high-fiving Dodger team that is joining the Giants in making the 
Cincinnati Reds sweat. 
</P>
<P>
With two-hit pitching by Mike Morgan and an 11-hit attack, the Dodgers defeated 
Cincinnati, 4-1, to move to within seven games of the first-place Reds. 
</P>
<P>
In winning their fifth consecutive game while the Reds lost their eighth in a 
row, the Dodgers also moved to within 1 1/2 games of second-place San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"What we did tonight, we have to do every night, because we are in a pennant 
race," pronounced catcher Rick Dempsey. "We are screaming and hollering in the 
dugout again. It is like 1988 again. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to go out (today) with Tim Belcher and try to beat the Reds right 
into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Before 43,616 fans, most of whom stayed until the end, the Dodgers showed that 
they have not forgotten what a pennant race looks like. 
</P>
<P>
Their attack featured a first-inning home run by Kirk Gibson; a pressure-RBI 
single by Dempsey; and pressure on Reds' pitcher Norm Charlton such that he 
threw two consecutive wild pitches, leading to another run. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan picked the biggest game of his Dodger career to pitch one of the best 
games of his life. He struck out seven and walked just one in the low-hit game 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He had a perfect game through 6 1/3 innings, until Barry Larkin singled to left 
field. Paul O'Neill then singled to center, moving Larkin to third base, from 
which he scored on Eric Davis' grounder. 
</P>
<P>
But the Reds did not hit Morgan again. In case there were still non- believers 
in the ninth inning, he capped the game with a leaping grab of Eddie Murray's 
shovel toss to force out pinch-hitter Ken Griffey at first base on a grounder. 
Morgan landed in a heap and twisted his right ankle, but he would not leave the 
game until he recorded the final two outs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in my career I have been in a pennant race. . . . I 
wasn't coming out," said Morgan (9-9), who broke a two-game losing streak. 
"This was a big win for myself, but moreso my team. After the All-Star break we 
were 13 games back, and now we look up and see that we are just seven. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wild. It's a three-team race. And we're in it." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan only hopes he will be in it. He said he was uncertain if his ankle, 
which was heavily wrapped after the game, would allow him to make his next 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty bad . . . but I've pitched three innings with a turned ankle 
before," he said. "And this is a pennant race." 
</P>
<P>
It seems the Reds are unsure. They appeared rattled from the moment in the 
first inning that Gibson lined a 2-and-1 pitch from Charlton into the 
right-field seats for his fourth homer. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, Hubie Brooks led off with a double to left. Dempsey 
followed with a single to center, scoring Brooks. Charlton moved Dempsey around 
the bases on two consecutive wild pitches. From third base, he easily scored on 
Juan Samuel's single. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Dodgers are in the pennant race, they must find a fifth starting 
pitcher to help keep them there. That means they now turn their attention to 
today's 9 p.m deadline for trading players without requiring waivers. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it appears the surging Gibson, who earlier demanded a trade, may 
stick around for at least a few more weeks. It doesn't appear the Dodgers can 
find the type of pitcher that would compensate for his loss. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very unlikely we will make a trade by that deadline," Vice President 
Fred Claire said Monday. "We have to look at the balance of our ballclub. We do 
not want to weaken ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The likelihood that we will fill our need for a a fifth starter through a 
trade is not very likely." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, they will turn to triple-A Albuquerque again for that pitcher. 
After Monday's game, the Dodgers promoted Jim Neidlinger, 8-5 with a 4.29 ERA 
at Albuquerque. The right-hander, in his seventh minor-league season, has yet 
to pitch in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Neidlinger will start Wednesday against San Francisco, replacing Terry Wells, 
who was demoted. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda hopes that, for now, his other starters can cover 
for a weak fifth link. 
</P>
<P>
"All we need now is consistent starting pitching," Lasorda said. "We've got 
(Ramon) Martinez and Belcher going good. Now if we can get Morgan and Fernando 
(Valenzuela) going good consistently, that is four good starters right there, 
and we'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ben Wade, Dodger scouting director for 18 years, announced Monday that he will 
retire at the end of the year. Wade, 67, helped build the great Dodger teams in 
the early 1980s, but lately he and the Dodger farm system have come under fire 
in the media for a series of first-round draft picks that have not progressed 
as hoped. None of the nine Dodger starters Monday were products of the Dodger 
system. "I've been criticized, but that didn't bother me," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
"People never got on me for signing guys like Bob Welch, who nobody else would 
touch. I'm leaving just because I feel it's time for a change." The search for 
Wade's successor could be the most important work the Dodgers do this summer. 
"It is not just an important job, it is the most important job here," Vice 
President Fred Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Griffin's bad month became worse last week when his mother, Mary, 
suffered a stroke at her Dominican Republic home. Griffin, who this month has 
endured a hitting slump and an arrest after a bar fight, said he considered 
returning to the Dominican, but his mother improved and was released from the 
hospital Monday. . . . Don Aase pitched the equivalent of three innings in his 
first simulated game since being put on the disabled list July 2 with a tender 
shoulder. He could be ready for a rehabilitation assignment by next week. The 
Dodgers' other disabled reliever, Pat Perry, threw for 20 minutes on the side 
and will pitch his first simulated game next week.

CLEMENS ACHING SHOULDER GIVES WHITE SOX PAIN

<P>
Roger Clemens is hurting, but he has found a way to turn the pain around. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens scattered nine hits Monday night, pitching his second consecutive 
shutout as the Boston Red Sox downed the Chicago White Sox, 3-0, at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm throwing zeroes, but I've been fortunate," Clemens said. "I'm just praying 
I can work myself through this. I've had to quit a little throwing on the side, 
but I'm making good pitches. Maybe I'm more of a pitcher now. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been pretty upset the last couple of weeks since word got out. I don't 
want anyone to know when I'm hurting. Once word gets out other teams have an 
advantage on me. And I don't like that." 
</P>
<P>
Taking a regular turn despite occasional right shouler pain that "feels like a 
cramp in the back of the leg," Clemens (14-5) struck out eight and didn't issue 
a walk in pitching the 23rd shutout of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens needed 125 pitches to extend his scoreless streak to 23 innings, 
continually pitching out of trouble, especially in the first few innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox remained one game behind Toronto in the AL East, and Chicago fell 
three games behind Oakland in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs had two doubles, driving in one run and scoring one, and Carlos 
Quintana hit a solo homer, his seventh, in helping Clemens beat Chicago's Adam 
Peterson (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 6, Seattle 2 -- Reliever Mike Jackson walked Dave Henderson to force in 
the go-ahead run and the Athletics scored four times with two out in the 
seventh to beat the Mariners at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle starter Randy Johnson (9-7) lost his fourth consecutive start. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Steinbach followed the walk to Henderson with a two-run single and Felix 
Jose singled home another run. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Honeycutt (2-2), the third of four Oakland pitchers, got the victory with 
relief help from Dennis Eckersley, who pitched 1 1/3 innings for his 32nd save. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 9, Baltimore 2 -- Kelly Gruber had three hits, including a two-run 
homer, and Todd Stottlemyre allowed six hits over six innings to snap a 
four-game losing streak as the Blue Jays routed the Orioles at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
George Bell hit the 200th home run of his career and Pat Borders added a 
two-run homer for the Blue Jays, who had 12 hits, including three by Mookie 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 3, Milwaukee 1 -- Bobby Witt allowed four hits in seven innings for his 
sixth consecutive victory as the Rangers beat the Brewers at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Witt (9-8), who is 5-0 in July, struck out five and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kunkel, a .147 hitter, broke a 1-1 tie with his first home run since last 
September a blast off Bill Krueger (5-6). 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 7, Cleveland 6 -- Gerald Perry homered to start a four-run fourth 
inning and Andy McGaffigan won his second consecutive start as the Royals beat 
the Indians at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
McGaffigan (2-0) gave up one run on five hits in 5 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Houston 6, San Francisco 1 -- Danny Darwin pitched eight strong innings and the 
Astros scored five runs in the eighth with the help of two errors to beat the 
Giants at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Houston broke a 1-1 tie when right fielder Mike Kingery misplayed Rafael 
Ramirez's bases-loaded sacrifice fly to score the first run. 
</P>
<P>
Pinch-hitter Carl Nichols singled home two runs and the final two came home 
when Matt Williams misplayed a routine grounder by Bill Doran. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 4, San Diego 3 -- Oddibe McDowell hit a leadoff homer in the 11th 
inning and the Braves beat the Padres at San Diego to snap a five-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Dwayne Henry (2-1) got the win with relief from Tony Castillo.

Charles (Red) Barrett, who holds the major league record for the fewest pitches 
in a nine-inning game, died at his home in Wilson, N.C., Saturday after a long 
illness. He was 75. Barrett, while pitching for the Boston Braves in 1944, 
faced 27 batters and threw only 58 pitches in a 2-0 victory over the Cincinnati 
Reds.

ARLINGTON STEWARDS REJECT THE PROTEST OF LUKAS' SWITCH

Stewards at Arlington International Racecourse on Monday rejected a protest 
challenging a switch in the lineup of Saturday's $600,000 Arlington Challenge 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Stewards ruled that trainer D. Wayne Lukas could remove from the lineup 
Criminal Type, the nation's top-ranked horse in the Thoroughbred Racing 
Communications poll. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas will be allowed to enter another of the horses he trains, last year's 
national grass champion Steinlen. 
</P>
<P>
Heriberto Arroyo, senior steward, said, "Our interpretation is that the 
conditions of the race do not specify a deadline for it." 
</P>
<P>
Gedaliah Goodman, the trainer of the horse Santangelo, protested the 
substitution, saying the change came after the lineup was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
"Invitations for the race closed on July 20, and Steinlen wasn't accepted for 
the race until two days later," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas pulled Criminal Type from the race after the purse was reduced from $1 
million to $600,000 when Easy Goer suffered a career-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
The race's conditions had called for the reduction if either Sunday Silence, 
the winner of last year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, or Belmont 
Stakes winner Easy Goer was declared out. Arlington officials then accepted 
Lukas' offer to enter 1989 grass champion Steinlen in Criminal Type's place.

DEL MAR; 
</P>
<P>
HAWKSTER IS RETIRED TO STUD AT 4 
</P>

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What had lately been a rumor became fact Monday. Owner Shelley Meredith 
announced that his horse, Hawkster, had been retired. 
</P>
<P>
Selected as Del Mar's top 3-year-old male in 1989, Hawkster will stand at stud 
at Airdrie Stud near Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster, who had been scheduled to run in the $250,000 Eddie Read Handicap 
Aug. 12, had been bothered by ankle problems for the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"His ankle problems began here last year," trainer Ron McAnally said. "I don't 
know how much longer we could have gone with him." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hawkster became known for his fifth-place finishes in all of the 
1989 Triple Crown races, the only time that has ever happened. 
</P>
<P>
Among his victories were triumphs in the second division of the Oceanside 
Stakes and the Del Mar Derby, both on turf here. 
</P>
<P>
After winning only five of the meeting's first 36 races, favorites have begun a 
comeback at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Four favorites won Sunday and the trend continued Monday with five more 
favorites winning. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran jockey Eddie Delahoussaye, who is spending his 11th summer at Del Mar, 
said poor early showings by favorites might have been caused by the soft Del 
Mar track. 
</P>
<P>
"Like any track, horses take a while to adapt to a new surface," Delahoussaye 
said. "This track has a little give to it." 
</P>
<P>
Shirkee, ridden by Russell Baze, took the lead in the final sixteenth to win 
the $46,000 turf feature by 2 1/2 lengths over Santa Tecla and Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Shirkee covered 1 1/16 miles over a firm course in 1:42 and paid $14.80, $5.40 
and $3. Santa Tecla returned $6.20 and $3 and Lowell paid $2.40.

Broad Inc.: The Los Angeles-based financial services company reported net 
income of $10.7 million for its third quarter ended June 30, up 17% from $9.2 
million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Net operating income (before net realized investment losses) rose 63% in the 
quarter to $15.8 million from $9.6 million. Chief Executive Eli Broad 
attributed the operating gain to a higher level of assets under management 
following the firm's acquisition of the core financial services businesses of 
Integrated Resources in January. However, the company also is experiencing a 
modestly higher level of net realized investment losses than anticipated 
earlier, he said.

THE NEW EUROPE GIVES A BOOST TO VACATION TRAVEL; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE AND THE GROWING POPULARITY OF MORE EXOTIC 
DESTINATIONS SPUR TICKET SALES BY INTERNATIONAL CARRIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Expansion of U.S. air carrier service to international destinations coupled 
with the historic changes sweeping across East Europe are spurring travelers to 
go overseas in droves, say San Diego travel agents, who are experiencing a busy 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
But transatlantic flights aren't the only tours giving international travel a 
boost, local travel agents and industry observers add. 
</P>
<P>
Growing popularity of "exotic" destinations in the South Pacific, such as 
Australia, New Zealand and the Fiji Islands, have helped U.S. airlines post 
double-digit growth in revenue passenger miles the last three years. The 
standard measuring stick for the airline industry, one revenue passenger mile 
equals one paying passenger flown one mile. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue passenger miles have been growing at an even healthier clip so far this 
year, industry observers say. 
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of 1990, U.S. carriers registered 42.7 billion 
revenue passenger miles, up 18.5% over the 36.1 billion revenue passenger miles 
recorded during the same period in 1989, according to the Air Transport Assn., 
the Washington-based industry group. 
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers boarding international flights also increased: during 
the first five months of 1990, U.S. airlines carried 15.6 million passengers, 
up 14% over the 13.7 million travelers who boarded overseas flights during the 
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Such growth almost guarantees the fourth, consecutive year that international 
travel will post a record revenue passenger miles figure, said Lee Howard, 
chief executive officer of Airline Economics, a Washington-based airline 
consulting firm and publisher of industry publications. 
</P>
<P>
"A globalization movement is afoot," Howard said. "The world is getting smaller 
at a geometric rate. There is more cohesiveness among countries, there are more 
business connections among countries. That has created a demand for 
international service and, as more international service is offered, more 
people travel overseas. We're in a growth cycle." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, international revenue passenger miles have increased at an average 
annual rate of 10%, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised if this is a record growth year," Howard said. 
"There's no question that we're going to reach a record level (of revenue 
passenger miles)." 
</P>
<P>
International travel is making a strong comeback after suffering major setbacks 
suffered in 1986: the Chernobyl nuclear accident and a spurt of terrorist 
activities persuaded travelers to keep their feet on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"With the terrorist activities that took place in 1986 behind us, we've noticed 
that people are ready to go back out there," said Michelle Goggin, leisure 
travel counselor at Balboa Travel in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only are they traveling to traditional European destinations in greater 
numbers, they're going to areas, what used to be the less popular areas, in 
Eastern Europe," Goggin said. "With the Berlin Wall going down, with more 
countries striving toward westernization . . . with glasnost more people are 
interested in going to the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Although Goggin could not provide specific figures, she said trips to Eastern 
Europe this summer have "at least doubled, if not tripled" over last year. 
</P>
<P>
Local travel agencies are booking many flights to traditional European 
destinations such as Austria and Switzerland, but Hana Huvar, a travel 
agent-trainee at Firstworld Travel of El Cajon, said Czechoslovakia and Poland 
are gaining attention, too. Huvar should know: in May, she traveled back to her 
hometown of Zlin, Czechoslovakia, for the first time since her native country 
instituted a democratic form of government. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many people who left Eastern Europe and came to live in San Diego," 
Huvar said. "Now a lot of them are going back to see what's happening in their 
homeland." 
</P>
<P>
But other regions of the world are attracting the attention of globe-trotters, 
too, travel agents say. Mexico continues to be a strong lure for San Diegans. 
In fact, Aero California, a Mexican airline, will start direct flights from San 
Diego to Cabo San Lucas at the tip of Baja California on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The America's Cup and aggressive advertising by Australian tourism officials in 
recent years have boosted the popularity of trips "down under." 
</P>
<P>
"People want to go further than just Hawaii," Goggin said. "They're heading for 
Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tahiti." A round trip fare to Sydney costs about 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Goggin is well aware that the outbreak of turmoil in foreign lands can 
bring an abrupt halt to growth patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Trips to China and excursions to Hong Kong or other nearby cities were gaining 
popularity until the June 1989 civil disturbances. "Those trips have 
significantly declined," said Goggin. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion of service and the addition of destinations have also played a major 
role in boosting international traffic volume. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to new routes, you're seeing more airports used for international 
flights," said David Swierenga, ATA's assistant vice president. "Traditionally, 
most international flights were from New York, Los Angeles and Miami, but, in 
recent years, you're seeing international service out of places like Pittsburgh 
and Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines, which posted a 14% June-to-June gain in revenue passenger 
miles, is one such carrier that is trying to establish a presence in the 
international market, said Al Becker, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In February, American Airlines inaugurated service to Sydney, Australia, and 
Auckland, New Zealand. Then in May, American introduced three non-stop routes 
from Chicago to Glasgow, Scotland, to Munich and to Dusseldorf. A non-stop 
flight from Miami to London just began this month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a reflection of the demand for international travel," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, which services 68 cities in Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, 
Africa and the Middle East, has also benefited from the crumbling of the Iron 
Curtain, said Elizabeth Hlinko, a company spokeswoman. Pan Am flies to 11 
cities in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, including non-stop flights from 
New York to Budapest, Moscow and Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of 1990, Pan Am registered 14.7 billion revenue 
passenger miles, up 11.4% over 13.2 billion revenue passenger miles recorded 
during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
"With Eastern Europe becoming such a hot spot, that has certainly helped our 
figures," Hlinko said.

CATALINA BOUND;

<P>
150-PASSENGER VESSEL TO OFFER REGULAR SERVICE BETWEEN OCEANSIDE AND THE ISLAND 
</P>

Seajet of Chula Vista is set to launch the first ferry service from Oceanside 
to Santa Catalina Island on Friday, but the company faces some rough waters 
that have already swamped a previous operator. 
</P>
<P>
Seajet president and owner W. T. (Ted) Gurnee, who also owns San Diego 
Shipbuilding of Chula Vista, last week unveiled the Renna G, a 20-m.p.h., 150- 
passenger vessel that will shuttle passengers Wednesday through Sunday between 
Oceanside Harbor and Avalon in about 2 1/2 hours each way. 
</P>
<P>
At $64 per person round trip, Gurnee said, he hopes Seajet will gross about 
$10,000 a day on the service. Out of his gross revenues, he must pay 5% to the 
Oceanside Harbor District and $1.50 per passenger to the city of Avalon on 
Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
In beginning an Oceanside-Catalina service, Gurnee is venturing into uncharted 
waters. Although ferry services to Catalina from San Diego, Los Angeles, 
Newport Beach and San Pedro have been successful, never before has a service 
used a North County point of departure. 
</P>
<P>
Two shuttles now take passengers from San Diego Harbor to Catalina. Both began 
service this spring. One is Catalina Pacifica and the other is Gurnee's Seajet, 
a service he insists is "close to being on budget." 
</P>
<P>
A company called California Cruisin' attempted to establish a San Diego to 
Catalina service but failed in 1988 after a year of service. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Oceanside is a smaller city, a growing tourism industry should 
provide plenty of customers, Gurnee said. Oceanside city officials, who hope 
the service stimulates local tourism, said they negotiated for two years with 
several companies before signing an agreement with Seajet. 
</P>
<P>
Gurnee concedes that a Catalina ferry service is a risky venture, mainly 
because of high boat-repair and maintenance expenses. But Oceanside officials 
said the strength of Seajet over other companies they negotiated with is that 
Seajet's sister company, San Diego Shipbuilding, has repair facilities nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Although other companies would be at the mercy of the schedules and fees of 
outside contractors, Seajet has an entire shipbuilding facility at its 
immediate disposal, Oceanside Mayor Larry Bagley said at the christening last 
week for the Renna G. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's going to be a great thing for the harbor, a great thing for 
Northern San Diego County, and it's certainly going to be a great thing for 
Catalina Island," Bagley said. Last Thursday, the blue-and-white Renna G glided 
quietly into Oceanside Harbor and docked near a row of small, quaint shops and 
restaurants. City officials and Seajet executives stood on the bow and watched 
Rena Gurnee, Ted Gurnee's 22-year-old daughter and the boat's namesake, smash 
the ceremonial bottle of Champagne against the boat's railing. An additional n 
was added to the name of the boat to help people pronounce it correctly, Gurnee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The boat was scheduled to make its first 50-mile run to Catalina island last 
Friday, but it was postponed for a week because the boat needed improve- ments, 
Gurnee said. In fact, the gray paint on the deck was still wet after the 
christening ceremony, and people's feet stuck to the floor as they stopped to 
talk to Gurnee. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a few things that aren't finished yet," he said. "We took on a very 
large burden . . . when we bought it." 
</P>
<P>
Gurnee bought the Renna G from the New York Harbor and Ferry Service this year 
and spruced it up at a total cost of about $1.2 million, Gurnee said. The boat, 
which is 110 feet long and 30 feet wide, arrived in San Diego about two weeks 
ago after a 21-day voyage from New York through the Panama Canal. Gurnee said 
he expects to sink an additional $300,000 into advertising and other start-up 
costs before the service turns a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside Harbor District Chief Executive Jim Manues said the city is looking 
for a solid, financially sound company and that Seajet fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, the reason a boat venture of this type fails is repair expenses," he 
said. Seajet has "the facilities they need to keep it up." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they have no estimates yet on the economic impact the ferry 
will have on Oceanside, but Manues said the Harbor District is expecting about 
$10,000 in monthly fees, depending on ridership. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we are interested in the revenue, but that's not the primary reason 
for doing this," he said. "It's a service to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Don Harrison, director of the San Diego Cruise Ship Consortium, agreed that 
things are looking brighter for San Diego-based ferry ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the passenger boat industry, I think it's getting stronger," he 
said. "There seems to be a tremendous curiosity on the part of visitors to get 
on the water and go somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Catalina had slightly more than a million visitors last year and 
some harbor congestion problems, the island can still accommodate more tourism, 
said Wayne Griffin, executive director of the Catalina Island Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"We sure hope (the ferry) is successful," he said. "We see San Diego County as 
a big market for us." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said he believes the Oceanside service will draw a new pool of North 
County tourists and will not compete significantly with San Diego ferry 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience with San Diego people is that they want to come out from San 
Diego," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the spotty record of San Diego ferry operations, Gurnee said he has 
plans for an even more ambitious venture: a high-speed, ocean-going shuttle 
between Oceanside and San Diego for commuters who want to forgo congested 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
If transportation studies planned for this fall support the viability of the 
shuttle, Gurnee said, he will build a 350-passenger ship capable of traveling 
at 50 m.p.h., which could efficiently move daily commuters from Oceanside to 
San Diego in the morning and back again in the evening. The boat would also 
make pleasure excursions to Catalina Island, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan has many obstacles but Gurnee remains steadfastly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, it is a service that will make money," he said. "It's a 
volume business. When the volume gets up . . . it will be profitable." 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials are happy to have a ferry service to Catalina, they are 
already looking forward to Gurnee's bigger venture. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been talking about this for two years," said Sam Williamson, a city 
councilman and chairman of the Harbor Committee. "We're looking forward to the 
larger unit that will seat 350. This is just the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
But Harrison of the cruise consortium said a water commuter service does not 
seem practical in the near future. Calling Gurnee a "visionary" and wishing him 
luck, Harrison said the plan's obstacles include the bond Southern Californians 
have with their cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, how many people want to use alternate forms of 
transportation?" Harrison said. "It's always been difficult to get people to 
take a boat somewhere that they can take a car."

Van Goghs Draw a Crowd: An exhibit of works by Vincent van Gogh in the 
Netherlands drew a record 1.2 million visitors over a four-month period, 
organizers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
People camped out through the weekend in hopes of seeing the show before it 
closed. The "Vincent van Gogh Retrospective" offered an unprecedented 
collection of masterpieces from museums and private collections around the 
world. It closed Sunday, the 100th anniversary of the Dutch artist's death. 
Nearly 140 paintings were on display in Amsterdam's Vincent van Gogh Museum, 
which houses the world's largest Van Gogh collection. Simultaneously, 248 
drawings were on display at the Kroeller Mueller Museum in Otterlo, about 55 
miles east of Amsterdam. GREG BRAXTON

Chuck Berry Bails Out: Rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry posted a $20,000 bond 
Monday at the St. Charles County Courthouse in Missouri, where he has been 
charged with possession of controlled substances and three counts of child 
abuse stemming from a June 23 raid on his estate in Wentzville, Mo., about 40 
miles west of St. Louis. The singer is scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 30 at the 
courthouse. Dick Alen, Berry's manager, said the arraignment date would not 
interfere with any of Berry's performances, including his Aug. 13 dates at the 
Strand in Redondo Beach. GREG BRAXTON

Berlin's Sheet Music Library Bought: The world's largest print music publisher 
has purchased the distribution and printing rights to Irving Berlin's vast 
sheet music treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Mardak, president of Hal Leonard Publishing Corp., said the company, 
which is based in Winona, Minn., plans to use Berlin's songs to develop new 
publications, including a deluxe coffee table-style song book and a children's 
song book. Mardak would not disclose the purchase price, but said the company 
will earn about $500,000 a year in gross sales from the deal. Berlin, who died 
in September at 101, composed nearly 1,000 songs, including such classics as 
"White Christmas" and "God Bless America." GREG BRAXTON

WORLD BEAT'S POLAR EXTREMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jamaica's Jimmy Cliff and Nigeria's Fela Kuti stand as progenitors of the 
current world-music consciousness. But paired on the "World Beat '90" tour, 
which came to the Greek Theatre on Sunday, they proved to represent polar 
extremes of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff -- stating flatly, "I am not a politician, I am a musician with a 
mission" -- espoused a one-world-peace-and-harmony philosophy and declared that 
the way to change the world is to "keep hitting . . . with positive sounds." 
Cliff's loping, spirited and tuneful reggae fits the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff classics ("The Harder They Come" and the soul hymn "Many Rivers to 
Cross") and newer material ("Reggae Down Babylon") all carried a sense of 
hopeful yet patient righteousness, pushed to the fore by the singer's giddy 
dance-mugging (described by one observer as "a cross between M. C. Hammer and 
Bill Cosby"). 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, Fela left no doubt that he is a politician. A forceful and 
articulate 10-minute speech was almost as prominently featured Sunday as the 
two half-hour musical pieces that made up his and his massive ensemble's 
headlining set. Where Cliff is one-world, Fela is emphatically Third World -- 
he even made a point of rejecting the world-beat tag as a manifestation of 
Western cultural imperialism, saying, "We don't play world-beat music, we play 
African music." STEVE HOCHMAN

PHILHARMONIC INSTITUTE ORCHESTRA OFFERS A LITTLE FLAIR AT ROYCE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were enough comings and goings, offstage peepings and beckonings, 
unexplained bangs and creakings, and shtick with the physical properties at 
Royce Hall Sunday evening for something by Feydeau. The official scripts for 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute Orchestra, however, by Jacob Druckman, 
Mozart and Shostakovich, were treated with becoming intensity and flair. 
</P>
<P>
After a bit by Druckman and Institute director Lynn Harrell with a 
malfunctioning public-address system, the comedy peaked in a routine for stage 
crew and piano lid, with score by Mozart. As part of the lengthy reshuffling of 
the stage between Druckman's "Aureole" and Mozart's E-flat Piano Concerto, K. 
482, the lid of the piano was removed, much to the loudly muttered befuddlement 
of soloist Yefim Bronfman. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell dashed down the aisle to intervene, but after consultation Bronfman 
decided to try the instrument as he found it. After the first movement, though, 
Harrell insistently beckoned conductor Lan Shui and Bronfman over to the side, 
and out came the crew with the lid, with more grumbling commentary from the 
pianist. 
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the lid did much to focus and clarify the instrument's 
sound, and Bronfman worked out whatever feelings of persecution he may have had 
in a chilly dissection of the Andante, followed by an athletically pointed 
Rondo. Bronfman was originally scheduled to lead the orchestra from the 
keyboard, but Institute fellow Lan Shui proved a valuable substitute on the 
podium, guiding a reduced band in a mellow, pertinent accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Druckman's "Aureole" is a colorful, percussion-rich soundscape from 1979, more 
explosive than shimmering but also purposefully committed to clear linear 
direction. William Eddins, an Institute associate fellow, maintained the 
forward momentum inherent in the piece, eliciting crisp, clean playing from the 
very full orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing funny about the culminating Shostakovich Fifth Symphony was the 
awkwardly wiggling podium dance it inspired in conductor David Alan Miller in 
the Allegretto. His was a reading more convincing in suave, affecting lyricism 
than poorly balanced thunder, encompassing a world of tragedy in his 
dramatically articulated Largo.JOHN HENKEN

'CENSORSHIP' EXPLORES HISTORY OF REPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUVAN GEER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art has become big business, commanding high prices and speaking the slippery 
language of investment potential. But the world of economics is the front yard 
of politics. So art, with its once-independent criteria for excellence, has 
suddenly found itself on the scrimmage line in a political football game with 
whistles to the left and right directing the play. 
</P>
<P>
Just how prone to social whim the rules of that game can be is the point made 
by the current exhibition "Censorship." This is a small gathering of historic 
paintings and photographs that have been at some point censored or labeled 
obscene, plus a few current images that would, given the current climate, 
undoubtedly be hit with the same tag. 
</P>
<P>
Composed mainly of erotic or homoerotic art, the exhibition deftly sidesteps 
the titillation factor inherent in this kind of imagery by focusing on issues 
of politics and repression. In the company of the boldly erotic 19th-Century 
Japanese Shunga woodblock prints and the sensuous but tame abstract etchings of 
Matta, Hans Burkhardt's "Crucifixion" -- labeled "communist" in 1949 for its 
modernist abstraction -- makes it clear that, more than any kind of moral 
imperative, it is simple fear of the unknown that feeds censorship. 
</P>
<P>
It is the strength of that argument that draws this very disparate work 
together. It's an understanding that unites Margaret Lazzari's powerfully 
explicit painting of a castrated white male figure with the puerile sexuality 
of an underground comic book on incest without equating the two as art. It adds 
tension to John C. Hesketh's gentle Cibachrome photo play of sex-in-the-suburbs 
to place it alongside Robert Mapplethorpe's leather-covered male model in light 
of the howls of protest his photographs have brought. The implication is that 
what goes around will come around -- to dictate definitions of art and 
sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
Given the different directions the artists follow here, the issue of obscenity 
emerges as a large one. Indeed, it remains a personal one, as this exhibition 
presents both innocuous images and others that undoubtedly push beyond what 
many individuals consider even faintly erotic. What the historic works and 
their attendant histories make clear is that obscene is too vague and 
inconsistent an adjective to be used for anything more than name-calling. And 
censorship, too, is revealed by time to be a hidebound reaction of insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Couturier Gallery, 166 N. La Brea Ave., to Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Power of the Mark: Laurence Dreiband's bold charcoal studies of clusters of 
black eucalyptus leaves are pure, powerful drawings. The subject may be 
mundane, but the power of the line and the way the artist spreads the forms 
like unpremeditated spills across the page are fresh. Indeed, the spontaneity 
and effortlessness of these compositions recall the Taoist principles of 
17th-Century Chinese painting. 
</P>
<P>
Dreiband's drawings celebrate the power of the mark: the cutting sharpness of a 
clean linear form, the delicate softness of finger smudges and erased edges. 
Most drawings are like works in progress, revealing the tender process of 
building up solid mass from dry pigment while trailing bits of unfinished 
drawing, dust and change across the once-pristine whiteness of the page. This 
appreciation for the exposed process of drawing gives each work an honest 
vigor. 
</P>
<P>
In the next gallery are Christopher Georgesco's long vertical columns of 
reinforced concrete and stainless steel. Ostensibly drawing their form from the 
space left by four circles meeting, these pieces have an odd finality about 
them. Like truncated and stretched modernist obelisks, they stand on odd, often 
problematic bases looking taut yet abruptly severed at top and bottom.

Madness From Within: The paintings Diane Gamboa puts together for this 
exhibition are their own kind of angular hell. Imbued with the Chicana artist's 
familiar love of busy pattern, careening line and bright color, this round of 
work has a jagged, disturbing energy. The pictorial spaces are tightly packed 
interiors where contrasting colors and pattern run riot over tilting spaces. 
Objects jockey to suggest three dimensions in what is blatantly a 
two-dimensional world. 
</P>
<P>
Gamboa's somewhat cartoony scenarios implying violence and upheaval are 
curiously open-ended for all the aggression they suggest. Indeed, her 
characters appear as unrepentant moral monsters along the lines of Leon Golub's 
tormentors or the "No Exit" denizens of Gronk's "Grand Hotel." By picturing 
this world from the inside, the artist and audience are made part of the 
depravity.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: PROLIFIC, PROVOCATIVE RUIZ HAS A TRIPLE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the many excellent foreign language filmmakers who rarely or never made it 
to U.S. theaters in the 1980s, one of the most provocative is French/Chilean 
Raul Ruiz -- represented by a strong triple bill tonight at the close of the 
UCLA Archive's retrospective. (Call (213) 206-FILM.) 
</P>
<P>
The prolific Ruiz (more than 60 films, long and short, in two decades) is not 
unknown to U.S. buffs. But his films do have qualities that made him an 
outsider in the conservative atmosphere of '80s U.S. movie distribution. 
They're intellectual, full of complex dialogue, symbolism, paradox and 
narrative and technical trickery -- and they open windows on interesting new 
currents in European art, theater, music, philosophy and literature. All the 
more reason for audiences that may be starved for offbeat sensibilities to seek 
him out. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's bill includes two of my favorites in the series: the 1980 short, 
"Snakes and Ladders," and the somewhat longer 1978 "Hypothesis of a Stolen 
Painting." The weakest film, "The Real Presence" (1978), is a disquisition on 
theater that, apparently, began as a TV documentary on the Avignon Festival and 
somehow metamorphosed into an intricate mix of report, personal drama and 
nightmare -- centering on the misadventures of an unemployed actor hired as the 
broadcast anchor. 
</P>
<P>
"Snakes and Ladders," on the other hand, is a playful little fantasy-travelogue 
conceived in the Byzantine riddle mode of Jorge Luis Borges, a writer with whom 
Ruiz is often compared. It's another assignment-gone-wild: in this case, a 
promotion film for a cartography exhibit at the Centre Pompidou, turned into a 
fantastic puzzle-tale. The protagonist, after happening on two strangers 
playing a board game in a field, immediately realizes, according to the 
narrator "that he is in a nightmare -- and the worst kind of nightmare; a 
didactic one." He is dispatched into a larger game in which he is, variously, 
player, game-piece and dice. Ruiz, a real master in these short, cryptic forms, 
makes this promo-film a bracingly deadpan fable-myth full of intellectual 
twists and japes. 
</P>
<P>
"Hypothesis of a Stolen Painting" was co-written with avant-garde novelist 
Pierre Klossowski -- from whom Ruiz adapted "The Stolen Vocation." Here, the 
Borgesian rhyme is even louder. The riddle-story is disguised as an art 
lecture, with a wordy academic actually walking into the paintings of a 
forgotten and fictitious petit master, "Tonnerre" -- as he attempts to unravel 
for us the mystery behind a strange scandal that supposedly gripped Paris on 
their first exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he -- and another narrator -- are discovering arcane clues everywhere 
(mirrors, shadows, glances or smiles). And the apparently simple 
academic-realistic paintings, with their cliched mythological or family 
portrait subjects become the reflection of a perverse, violent family sexual 
scandal and a sinister, perhaps worldwide, conspiracy. Absorbing stuff. Like 
"Snakes and Ladders," it makes you wonder what kind of magic Ruiz could weave 
with more opulent budgets.

PROPOSED CURBS ON LAPD FOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: CHIEF GATES ARGUES AGAINST RESTRICTIONS ON WORKING WITH 
IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates objected Monday to proposed curbs on 
cooperation between police and immigration authorities, saying the restrictions 
"would seriously endanger our ability to ensure public safety in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The council's proposal includes limits on cooperation with foreign law 
enforcement agencies, which Gates said would affect the department's 
Anti-Terrorist Division. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter made public at a meeting of the Council's Public Safety Committee, 
Gates also objected to a provision that would bar any police cooperation with 
an INS investigation, detention or arrest except in service of a search or 
arrest warrant or in cases in which police believe that the suspect has 
committed a felony. 
</P>
<P>
"While I understand the committee's concerns as expressed in the proposed 
procedures," Gates said, "I believe all residents of Los Angeles are best 
served when its Police Department is able to work cooperatively with all 
segments of government to provide for the public's safety." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed guidelines would prevent the LAPD from initiating any action on 
the basis of an individual's immigration status. Cooperation with any foreign 
government's investigation of immigrants would also be prohibited, unless the 
immigrant was suspected of having violated federal, state or local laws. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant rights groups and council members Michael Woo and Richard Alatorre 
called for the new guidelines after two recent incidents in which police have 
rescued immigrants from the hands of smugglers demanding ransom, only to turn 
the hostages over to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said the proposed policy would help curb what he called a rash of 
unreported crimes against immigrants. "Those crimes go unreported for one 
simple reason -- people are afraid of being turned over to the INS," Alatorre 
said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Gates' objections, Alatorre made minor changes in the wording of 
some of the proposed amendments to department policy. Deputy Chief William 
Rathburn told the committee that the department had not yet reviewed the 
amended proposal. 
</P>
<P>
To give the Police Department time to respond to the amendments, the committee 
then forwarded the proposed policy to the full council without recommendation. 
The council is expected to consider the measure in a week or two, Alatorre 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said Monday he expected some council members to oppose the measure. He 
said he would meet with LAPD Assistant Chief Robert Vernon this week in an 
attempt to reach a compromise on the issue.

COUNCIL TO DECIDE THE BATTLE OF SYLVAN FRYMAN CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seen from an overlook on Mulholland Drive, Fryman Canyon appears as a small 
island of green amid a vast sprawl of single-family homes and asphalt streets. 
But the solitude that can be found in the steep ravine belies its location in 
the heart of a crowded city. 
</P>
<P>
The contradiction helps explain why this narrow slice of land has become the 
focus of an unusually heated battle between developer Fred Sahadi, who plans to 
build 26 luxury homes in Fryman Canyon, and neighboring residents, who want it 
preserved in its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council is scheduled to vote today on whether half of the 
canyon's 63 acres should be declared a city landmark, a designation that could 
halt construction for a year and lower the value of the land. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi argues that the land is not worthy of cultural-historic monument status 
because there is nothing that distinguishes it from other undeveloped land in 
the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all the Santa Monica Mountains are special," the San Jose-based 
developer said. "I believe it with every ounce of everything in me. It's an 
incredibly beautiful mountain range, but putting 26 more homes on 63 acres does 
not in any way defile the land or compromise the beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon users counter that the tiny ravine has a long history of offering easy 
refuge from the chaos of urban life, and thus qualifies for cultural landmark 
status. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes it so nice is that you feel like you are out of the city 
completely," said Eric McFadden, 34, an attorney who lives in Laurel Canyon and 
jogs on the wooded trail every day. 
</P>
<P>
While the debate over Fryman Canyon has engaged a predictable cast of 
developers, residents, environmentalists and politicians, the land itself 
offers important testimony -- both for and against its preservation. 
</P>
<P>
It takes 30 minutes to walk down the canyon from the Mulholland overlook to the 
housing tract nestled below. Hikers follow a wooded, zig-zagging trail down the 
steep side of the hill, then go through a narrow poison oak-filled gully to a 
dark forest. 
</P>
<P>
The deep, sheltered ravine is packed with a wide variety of plant life, and 
early morning joggers say they encounter deer, coyotes, rattlesnakes, 
squirrels, rabbits and lizards along the trail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only place in the whole big city where you feel close to nature," 
said Abbie Jaye, 30, of Sherman Oaks, who brings her two dogs to the canyon 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley below the canyon is blocked from view by California 
walnut trees and expansive bushes as high as 12 feet. The growth forms a 
protective canopy, sheltering hikers from the sun; in other places, the trees 
cluster so tightly that they seem to form a natural wall. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, reminders of the city are never far away. Ten minutes down the canyon 
trail, a stream intersects. There, six cars are half-buried in dirt and leaves, 
decaying and covered with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the rusting vehicles -- some so badly deteriorated that their 
original colors cannot be determined -- were probably stolen, stripped for 
parts, then pushed into the canyon from Mulholland. Beer bottles, cups and auto 
parts litter the spot. 
</P>
<P>
The ravine also acts as an echo chamber, amplifying sounds from the residential 
neighborhood below and construction projects above. On a recent morning, the 
canyon reverberated with the sounds of a bulldozer, a gardener's leaf-blower, a 
crying child and the drone of an ascending airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Intermingled with the urban noise, though, the astute listener can discern bird 
calls, the rustle of leaves in the wind, even the gurgle of water trickling 
over rocks. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to save their haven, canyon users have waged a fierce campaign in 
the boardrooms of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and the chambers of 
City Hall. In May, a coalition of environmentalists and area residents 
persuaded the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission to declare half the site 
a city cultural monument, a designation which the City Council is scheduled to 
consider today. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Sahadi has said he would sell the property for a park. A week ago, 
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy voted to offer $8.7 million to purchase 
it. 
</P>
<P>
But Sahadi estimates that the land -- in Studio City just west of Laurel Canyon 
-- is worth about $13.7 million, forcing city officials to scurry to locate 
funds to supplement the conservancy's offer for the prime real estate. As of 
late Monday, they still were looking for a source of the extra $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Let them pay for it if they want it," Sahadi said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pure economics. We've spent a whole lot of money earning the right to 
develop it." 
</P>
<P>
If Sahadi is allowed to build, his houses will occupy about half the canyon 
toward the bottom and will not effect the hiking trail. The houses, however, 
would interfere with one of the ravine's most popular features -- a sliver of a 
brook that cuts down through the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The hiker who wants to follow the noise of the brook must branch off the trail 
and follow a narrow little gully, which leads down to the bottom of the canyon 
to the oak forest -- and houses -- below. 
</P>
<P>
The brook seems to carry barely as much as a garden hose at full volume. But 
slated for destruction by the housing project, the brook has become the subject 
of intense debate. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say the water is a perennial stream -- a permanent stream 
that is protected state law -- and have appealed to the state Department of 
Fish and Game to save it. Sahadi says the highly touted "stream" is merely 
runoff from the residential neighborhoods above the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
As water slides down the stair-like rock formations and settles in stagnant 
pools, it is difficult to tell whether it springs from the earth or is backwash 
from a swimming pool. What is obvious is that the water nourishes lots of trees 
and plants. And bugs. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult climb down the gully, which is about 10 feet wide at some 
points but narrows to less than three feet at others. 
</P>
<P>
Even while heat and smog suffocate the San Fernando Valley, the gully -- shaded 
by ash, oak, and Sycamore trees -- is cool. The air smells sweet and fresh, 
like the air inside a plant-filled greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the walls of the gully flatten out and the stream abruptly disappears 
underground, where it nurtures a dark grove of century-old oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Teel, one of the members of the Urban Wilderness Coalition, the group that 
has taken the lead in trying to protect the canyon, fears that even if the 
canyon survives, the quiet of the land could be destroyed by new waves of 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best parts about it now is that you can really not run into anyone 
there," Teel said. "But if our dreams our realized, from the publicity it will 
get, a lot more people will start to go."

3 KILLED, 3 INJURED IN FIERY FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY and JEFFREY BALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three people died and three were hurt Monday morning in a fiery collision of a 
motor home carrying a family from Canada and a tractor-trailer rig hauling 
50,000 pounds of tomatoes on a Burbank freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The 10:45 a.m. accident -- which California Highway Patrol investigators 
believe was caused by a pickup truck that made an unsafe lane change and struck 
the motor home -- forced closure of both sides of the Golden State Freeway for 
about an hour and all southbound lanes for more than five hours. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP was seeking the driver of the white pickup truck, who did not stop. The 
truck apparently was heavily damaged on its right side, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
A British Columbia couple and their daughter who were on their way to 
Disneyland were killed when their 30-foot motor home and the big rig pulling 
two trailers of tomatoes collided in the southbound lanes, then careened off 
the freeway into the concrete bridge abutment below the Burbank Boulevard 
overpass. The motor home was crushed and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
A teen-age boy in the motor home was rescued by two off-duty Los Angeles 
firefighters who arrived moments after the collision. M. W. Johnson, battalion 
chief of the Burbank Fire Department, said the two firefighters, Greg 
Gilchrist, 31, and George Duarte, 30, pulled 14-year-old Gaben Sweezie out of 
the wreckage but were unable to save the other family members. 
</P>
<P>
The two firefighters also rescued the driver of the truck, Lothlin M. Braziel, 
41, of Porterville. He and Kelly Waisanen, a 15-year-old Sacramento girl who 
was in a car that was sideswiped during the accident, were treated at Burbank 
Community Hospital for minor injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
Gaben Sweezie suffered second- and third-degree burns over 80% to 90% of his 
body and was in critical but stable condition at Childrens Hospital of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Names of the three members of the boy's family killed in the accident were not 
released immediately. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Sgt. Mike Brey said the small, possibly foreign-made pickup was in the fast 
lane and apparently changed lanes in front of the motor home and hit the front 
end of the boxlike vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"The motor home then went to the right and hit the tractor-trailer, and the 
impact then ignited the motor home," Brey said. "Together they hit the bridge 
abutment." 
</P>
<P>
The truck rig jackknifed, spilling about half of its load of tomatoes onto the 
freeway. Fire from the wreckage spread to brush on the hillside next to the 
freeway, but the flames were quickly extinguished after firefighters arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP closed all lanes of the freeway while a helicopter landed to take the 
injured boy to the hospital and Burbank firefighters worked to douse the 
flames. The northbound lanes were then reopened, but all southbound lanes 
remained closed while the accident was under investigation and debris was 
cleared. Two lanes reopened at 4:40 p.m., in time for rush hour, and the 
freeway was back to normal by late evening. 
</P>
<P>
Gilchrist and Duarte said they arrived on the scene before police and 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tangled mess of metal and tomatoes," Gilchrist said. "It was ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte and Gilchrist parked their car about a quarter of a mile north of the 
accident, grabbed two helmets and a firefighter's protective coat -- the only 
gear they had with them -- from the car's trunk, and ran toward the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters, assigned to Station 39 in Northridge, had been on their way 
to a station in downtown Los Angeles to practice driving a ladder truck. They 
said they believe the fire from the crushed motor home spread quickly because 
of diesel fuel spilled from the tractor's tanks. Flames shot about 30 feet into 
the air from the wreckage, Duarte said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was burning furiously at the back of the truck and was moving toward 
the cab, Duarte said. Another motorist who had stopped alerted the firefighters 
to the truck's cab, leaning against a retaining wall at a 45-degree angle with 
the driver trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte said he picked up a coil spring that had broken off the truck and used 
it to smash the passenger window. Gilchrist reached in and pulled the driver, 
dazed and disoriented, to safety. 
</P>
<P>
As Gilchrist was leading the driver away from the truck, he and Duarte heard 
screams from the rear of the rig. It was then that they noticed that a motor 
home had been crushed under the wreckage and saw the Sweezie boy trying to 
crawl out as flames engulfed the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Gilchrist said he ran to the boy and pulled him to safety. The boy yelled that 
his family was still inside the camper, but when the firefighters returned and 
broke the rear window, flames shot out with such intensity that they were 
unable to enter. 
</P>
<P>
"To sit and watch somebody burn to death, it's a helpless feeling," Duarte 
said. "Not having the resources with me -- all I had was a coat and a helmet -- 
I couldn't put the fire out. It was just too big." 
</P>
<P>
"Things were popping all around -- tires, gas tanks. It was an eerie feeling," 
Gilchrist added. 
</P>
<P>
Gaben told authorities his family was on the way to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll go home to my family and thank God we're all safe," Gilchrist said.

With a rose in her hand and an opinion or three on her lips, a defiant Zsa Zsa 
Gabor strode out of the El Segundo slammer Monday afternoon after serving a 
72-hour sentence for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor's coming out drew dozens of pushy paparazzi and more than 100 other 
curious onlookers. Her exit was delayed 15 minutes while she applied makeup. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian-born actress informed reporters that her cell had been too 
chilly, that her meals had been too salty, but that her jailers had proven 
charming and good-looking. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very happily surprised -- everybody was more than nice and sweet," Gabor 
said. "I found out one thing, guys. They are much handsomer police officers in 
here than Paul Kramer (the Beverly Hills officer she was convicted of 
slapping). And they are much nicer." 
</P>
<P>
Had she learned a lesson? reporters shouted. 
</P>
<P>
"Never," Gabor replied. " . . . I never done a damn thing." 
</P>
<P>
She had been sentenced to the three-day term -- as well as 120 hours of 
community service, nearly $13,000 in fines and a psychiatric evaluation -- 
after a circus-like, three-week trial that stemmed from a routine traffic stop 
last year. Accused by the trial judge of "milking" the case for publicity, 
Gabor was convicted of slapping Kramer, driving without a license and 
possessing an open flask of whisky in her $215,000 Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
Dropping her planned appeal -- but deciding against serving the sentence in a 
county facility, where, she said, she was afraid of attack by lesbians -- the 
former Miss Hungary opted to pay $85 a night for a "Graybar Hotel" room in the 
El Segundo Jail under a weekend program offered to many county convicts. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, 72, had a four-bed cell to herself, and was visited daily by her 
husband, Prince Frederick Von Anhalt of West Germany. He brought her pillows, 
blankets ("I was given a horse blanket in jail," she explained) and ice cream, 
but he was denied permission to deliver Gabor sausages and goulash. 
</P>
<P>
Upon her fashionably late exit, Gabor was surrounded by a media phalanx so 
unruly that it resembled a British soccer crowd. Behind the reporters stood 
more than 100 El Segundo residents, several cheering but others booing or 
waving picket signs, including one that read, "Darling, the rules are for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Mindy McManus, 13, explained the size of the crowd in this way: "El Segundo is 
boring and there's nothing else to do." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, garbed in a yellow sweat shirt from a Beverly Hills fashion emporium, 
told reporters that she had spent her incarceration finishing work on her 
autobiography and filing papers for her jailers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she also had done some thinking, Gabor snapped, "I always have time to 
think, you dummy. How could I live without thinking?" 
</P>
<P>
As for the jail food, she declared, "it was terrible -- I wouldn't give it to 
my dog." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Gabor waved goodby, kissed a 3-year-old toy Doberman pinscher, 
handed her rose to an onlooker and hopped into the passenger seat of a black 
Mercedes-Benz. It was parked directly across the street from a gift shop called 
the House of Cards.

<P>
Gabor then headed back to Beverly Hills, where she said she had one immediate 
plan: "To take a hot bath."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY PROPOSES WIDER USE OF HOMELESS 
SHELTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on Monday proposed keeping armories and 
recreation centers open to the homeless from mid-December through mid-February 
regardless of weather conditions. Bradley's proposal comes in the wake of 
criticism that the current policy -- which is to open shelters only when 
temperatures drop below 40 degrees or when it is raining and below 50 degrees 
-- fails to meet the needs of the tens of thousands of homeless in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bradley's plan, the shelters would be kept open between Dec. 16 and Feb. 
13, and would also be open from as early as Nov. 1 and as late as March 31 
whenever the cold and wet weather criteria were met. 
</P>
<P>
There would be eight central shelters in six areas of the city, including three 
downtown and in surrounding neighborhoods, and one each in the South-Central 
and Harbor districts as well as the Westside, San Fernando Valley and 
Hollywood.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE DEPARTMENT ASKS FOR DELAY ON HELIPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with mounting opposition from Hollywood Hills homeowners, the Los Angeles 
City Fire Department asked Monday for more time to discuss with residents a 
department proposal to locate a helicopter ambulance service on a ridge above 
the Hollywood sign. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials and Council President John Ferraro, who represents the area, 
asked a hearing examiner for the city's Planning Commission to delay making a 
recommendation on the proposal until Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents who live near the proposed heliport complained at the hearing 
that noise from the operation would be intolerable and urged the Fire 
Department to find a location away from residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing examiner Charles Rausch, who was scheduled to make his recommendation 
to the Planning Commission on Sept. 6, asked the Fire Department to submit the 
request for a delay in writing. He said it would have to be approved by the 
commission.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CUSTOMS SWEEP NETS 650,000 TOY GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nationwide sweep by the U.S. Customs Service, including a seizure earlier 
this month in Los Angles, has netted more than 650,000 toy gun imports worth 
$900,000 that were confiscated because the replicas look too much like deadly 
weapons, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The latest seizure was made July 5 when agents here confiscated 12,000 toy 
rifles from an undisclosed location, said Ed Kittredge, a spokesman for the 
Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
Kittredge was unable to provide any other details about the Los Angeles case, 
but said seizures have also been made in Boston, Seattle, San Juan and other 
major ports since April. 
</P>
<P>
The toy guns, which range from cheap water pistols to costly authentic 
collector's replicas, violate a federal law enacted last year that requires 
markings to distinguish the toys from real weapons. The markings usually 
consist of a bright orange plug permanently fixed in the muzzle or a bright 
orange band around the end of the muzzle, the Customs Service said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 PLEAD NO CONTEST TO KIDNAP, SEX COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men from the Lennox area pleaded no contest Monday to charges of kidnaping 
and sexually assaulting a cellist as she left a concert rehearsal at El Camino 
College and of abducting and trying to rape a Hawthorne woman. 
</P>
<P>
In pleading no contest to eight felony counts, Francisco Morales agreed to 
accept a prison sentence of 36 years, while Jose Trujillo said he would accept 
a 25-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
A Torrance Superior Court judge is scheduled to formally sentence the pair at a 
hearing on Aug. 20, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Geltz said. 
</P>
<P>
Morales and Trujillo were accused of staging two kidnapings in three days last 
March. During the first incident, the pair abducted a 28-year-old Hawthorne 
woman and tried to rape her at knifepoint. Three days later, the two men 
attacked a 23-year-old woman in a parking lot at El Camino College near 
Torrance.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE FINALLY BECOMES FAN FAVORITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball without George Steinbrenner is like a day with sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
Start spreading the news. He's leaving today. No longer be a part of it. New 
York, New York. 
</P>
<P>
These vagabond shoes are walking away. He got thrown out at home. New York, New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
George wants to wake up in the city that never sweeps. To find he's out with 
the trash. Top of the heap. 
</P>
<P>
Sing it, Liza. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there's one fewer worm in the Apple today. 
</P>
<P>
Holy cow, Phil Rizzuto. Kiss him goodby. 
</P>
<P>
Boss George, the Yankee shipper, got it exactly the way he gave it. He got 
fired. Canned. Dumped. Bounced. Axed. Cut. Released. Put on waivers. Sent down. 
</P>
<P>
He's lucky the Yankees didn't ship him to Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be looking for Steinbrenner or Donald Trump or Leona Helmsley at the 
unemployment office, but don't expect much laughing on the way to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
At last we have shed ourselves of the George, a guy who didn't have all his 
seams on his fastball, if you know what I mean. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner of baseball has turned out to be a pretty tough cookie. Maybe 
that's what happens when you grow up with the name Fay. 
</P>
<P>
My first reaction Monday was that Steinbrenner got off light. Then I changed my 
mind. They took the star off his dressing-room door. That's good enough for me. 
</P>
<P>
George needs the spotlight. He feeds off it, like Gloria Swanson in "Sunset 
Boulevard." Without it, George can't be George. He's just some guy in a suit 
and tie. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody is saying that George might still run the Yankees from backstage or 
maybe the rafters. Phantom of the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
I guess they picture George wearing half a mask. Or George sneaking into the 
stadium in Groucho glasses or a phony Castro beard. 
</P>
<P>
If you ever see somebody in a wig and a size-24 dress singing the national 
anthem, it could be George, trying to sneak in. 
</P>
<P>
One of the conditions of Fay Vincent's verdict was that George has to give Fay 
a call whenever he wants to come out to the park. Somehow I can't see Georgie 
Boy peeking through a knothole. 
</P>
<P>
While I haven't read the entire ruling yet, I hear George also must get Fay's 
permission when he wants to walk the dog, leave the dinner table, stay up late 
or sleep overnight at a friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner has become Ward Cleaver to Steinbrenner's Beaver. 
</P>
<P>
Yet after giving it more thought, I suppose Vincent really did throw the book 
at the Yankee owner, high and inside. There aren't many businesses where 
somebody can have the owner removed, except maybe mortgage banking. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda, one of the few men alive who hasn't managed the Yankees, said 
Monday: "George has been a colorful owner, but I think it's time for him to sit 
back, relax and let somebody else do the driving." 
</P>
<P>
Lou Piniella, also in Dodger Stadium on Monday, had this revealing comment on 
the man who hired and fired him: "No comment." 
</P>
<P>
Lou's no dope. He knows if he isn't careful, some New York newspaper will run 
some headline like: "Lou to George: Drop Dead." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner being busted from big-buck general to buck private is big, big 
news in New York. Some people think he's the most misunderstood man alive. 
Others consider him the designated Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, George would be on Page 1 in New York today even if somebody 
replaced the Statue of Liberty with a life-sized replica of Connie Chung. 
</P>
<P>
I like this "permanent ineligible list" that George is now on. I'd like to put 
my last girlfriend on it. 
</P>
<P>
George is eligible to do consultations with the Yankees, but not on free agency 
and maybe not on trades. This means he can give advice on interior decorating 
and frozen-malt sales. 
</P>
<P>
There also is the matter of who will replace Steinbrenner as the team's head 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
If, for example, the job goes to Son of Steinbrenner and stays in the family, 
then, yes, George got off easy. I forget his kid's name. Gomez or Fester or 
Pugsley, something like that. 
</P>
<P>
For 18 years, George Steinbrenner has ruled the Yankees with an iron skull. He 
has gotten rid of so many great players, Yankee Stadium ought to erect a 
monument to him -- outside Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
I have always considered Steinbrenner to be living proof that money can't buy 
you brains. 
</P>
<P>
Is George evil? Of course not. He is just a rich nincompoop who should have 
been famous for 18 minutes instead of for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Have we heard the last of George? Probably not. He'll turn up like a million 
bad pennies. 
</P>
<P>
At least George got something Monday that he has wanted his whole life: a 
Yankee Stadium standing ovation. Gosh, if he'd known he would be this popular, 
he would have gotten himself fired years ago. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, I still don't know what he did wrong. But aren't you glad he did 
it?

U.S. LOSES BIG ON ICE, DIAMOND; 
</P>
<P>
GOODWILL GAMES: SOVIETS ROUT AMERICANS IN HOCKEY, 10-1; CUBA DOES SAME IN 
BASEBALL, 16-2. 
</P>

<P>
It was another dark day for the United States at the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the U.S. basketball team lost to Yugoslavia in the gold medal 
game, the Soviet Union scored four times in the first period and routed the 
U.S. hockey team, 10-1, at Kennewick, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
In another setback, the Cubans trounced the U.S. baseball team, 16-2. 
</P>
<P>
The American hockey team came into the game with high hopes after upsetting the 
world champion Soviets in an exhibition game last week. But they never got 
close, unable to penetrate a strong defense led by goalie Arturs Irbe and 
appearing helpless against the swift, strong Soviet attackers. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets are 2-0 and the United States fell to 1-1 in the eight-team round 
robin tournament. The Soviets will be one of the top two teams in their bracket 
to advance to the medal round. The Americans also will move on if they beat 
West Germany (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
Valeri Kamensky picked up a loose puck in front of the net and shot it over the 
shoulder of goalie Ray LeBlanc 3:42 into the game. At 9:16, Alexander Semak 
took the puck behind the U.S. net, skated to the front and put it in for a 2-0 
Soviet lead. 
</P>
<P>
Only 23 seconds later, Andrei Kovalenko was left alone in front of LeBlanc and 
he sent home a wrist shot. When Jim Nesich was stopped by Irbe on a breakaway 
and the Soviets took the rebound right back down the ice for another goal -- on 
Dimitri Khristich's slap shot -- the issue was no longer in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Sacco of Boston University scored the United States' goal at 4:40 of the 
third period. 
</P>
<P>
Pavel Bure and Evgeny Davydov had two goals each for the Soviets, who also got 
scoring from Viatcheslav Kozlov and Vladimir Malakhov. 
</P>
<P>
This U.S. team beat the Soviets, 3-1, in Oakland in late July. They lost a 
second exhibition game the next night, and it was after that game that Soviet 
center Sergei Fedorov defected to the Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
The United States had not beaten the Soviet national team in an international 
tournament game since the "Miracle on Ice" at the 1980 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The game was the only sellout in the hockey preliminaries. No other session 
drew above 4,300, and most have attracted far less to the 6,000-seat arena. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful Cuban baseball team left the United States with only a chance to 
win a bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
Omar Linares, the 22-year-old Cuban third baseman considered the best amateur 
baseball player in the world, had four doubles and one single in five at-bats. 
He had three runs batted in and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans scored twice in the top of the seventh inning on Brent Gates' 
run-scoring double and when David McCarty hit into a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba plays the winner of Monday night's Japan-Canada late game for the gold 
medal today. The U.S. plays the loser of that game for the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Reyes of the United States scored the biggest upset yet in boxing, 
beating reigning bantamweight world champion Enrique Carrion of Cuba on a 3-2 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes, who missed last year's world championships, overcame persistent holding 
by Carrion and carried the fight to the Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Marquez of Houston beat Mujo Bajrovic of Yugoslavia, 5-0, in a 
welterweight semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
American heavyweights fared worse, as Felix Savon of Cuba decisioned Javier 
Alvarez of San Antonio, and Bert Teuchert of West Germany beat John Bray of Van 
Nuys, by 5-0 scores. 
</P>
<P>
Americans won gold medals in the solo and duet competition of synchronized 
swimming. 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Babb of Clayton, Calif., placed first in the solo with 98.80 points. 
Mikako Kotani of Japan was second, and Nathalie Guay of Canada took bronze. 
</P>
<P>
In duets, 26-year-old twins Karen and Sarah Josephson of Bristol, Conn., the 
1988 Olympic silver medalists, won the gold with a 98.88 score. 
</P>
<P>
In volleyball, Craig Buck, a 1984 and 1988 Olympic gold medalist, helped power 
the United States past France, 15-12, 15-13, 9-15, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
Buck had 12 kills and 12 blocks. Teammate Uvaldo Acosta had 27 kills and Marc 
Jones posted 26.

TARVER, O'BANNON REVIEW OPTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: TARKANIAN SAYS UNLV LIKELY IS OUT OF RUNNING FOR SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA'S TWO MOST PRIZED RECRUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada Las Vegas said Monday that he has all but given 
up hope of keeping prize basketball recruits Shon Tarver and Ed O'Bannon in the 
wake of NCAA sanctions that bar the Rebels from postseason competition next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver, a 6-foot-5 guard from Oxnard Santa Clara High School, made an official 
visit to Arizona State over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"He is examing his options," said John Tarver, Shon's father. "Personally, I 
would like for him to have a decision by the end of the week." 
</P>
<P>
Tarver and O'Bannon, a 6-8 forward from Lakewood Artesia High School, are 
considered Southern California's two best recruits. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach George Raveling said that the O'Bannons promised to tell him if Ed 
decided not to attend UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Raveling said, they have not called. O'Bannon had considered Arizona 
State, Syracuse, USC and UCLA before selecting UNLV last May. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Last week in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Tarkanian speculated that Tarver 
would attend UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just my guess," he was quoted as saying. "He absolutely will not go to 
Syracuse." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian said Monday that he was simply passing along the biggest coaches' 
rumor of the summer, that Tarver and O'Bannon will enroll at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
John Tarver said he did not know whether his son and O'Bannon were planning to 
attend UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Shon has talked to Ed since Ed got back (from a trip to 
Uruguay)," he said. "Shon will make the decision that's best for him." 
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of Tarkanian, neither Tarver nor O'Bannon signed a letter of 
intent to attend UNLV last spring. Each, however, announced that he would 
enroll although the school was being investigated for recruiting violations 
stemming from a 1987 incident with a New York prep player. 
</P>
<P>
But the sanctions announced last week stem from a 1977 case that most thought 
would not result in such severe punishment. The school also may be sanctioned 
for the more recent allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough thing," Tarkanian said. "(Tarver and O'Bannon) were all set to 
come here. The sad thing from my standpoint is that in 18 years I've been at 
the university, this is the first time we've got the two best kids out of 
Southern California. And to lose them like this really hurts us." 
</P>
<P>
Neither player can sign a letter of intent now that the one-month period for 
such transactions has passed. Whatever decision they make will not be binding 
until they actually enroll at a school. Tarver and O'Bannon could announce 
where they are going this week and change their minds before the fall semester 
begins.

RAMS' HENLEY COLLAPSES IN LOCKER ROOM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ram cornerback Darryl Henley collapsed in the team's locker room at UC Irvine 
Monday evening and was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for what the 
Rams described as "exhaustion and dehydration." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Tustin Health Care Medical Center would say only that Henley's 
condition was stable. 
</P>
<P>
The second-year cornerback from UCLA collapsed on the trainer's table at 6:20 
p.m., about 90 minutes after Monday's afternoon practice ended. He was treated 
at the scene by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
"He was cramping up in the locker room," said linebacker Paul Butcher, an 
eyewitness. "He was hyperventilating a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams later released a statement, which read, in part: "Henley's condition 
has been stabilized and he is currently undergoing additional precautionary 
tests. He will be released later this evening and return to the Rams training 
facility at UC Irvine."

YANKEES SHOCKED BY NEWS; 
</P>
<P>

OF STEINBRENNER'S PUNISHMENT.

New York Yankee players and coaches got their first clue about George 
Steinbrenner's fate when they heard the crowd. They knew the cheers meant 
Steinbrenner had been given a stiff penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Those cheers from the crowd of 24,037 came in the fourth inning when the 
announcement of the Commissioner Fay Vincent's decision was made on the radio 
as Yankee starter Dave LaPoint was pitching to Detroit's Cecil Fielder. 
</P>
<P>
The game was delayed by the 90-second standing ovation, and when it resumed, 
LaPoint gave up two-run homer to Fielder, his 33rd homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like the fans were charging the mound before Fielder hit the home 
run," said La Point, who ended up getting the victory in a 6-2 win over the 
Tigers. "That's a terrible bunch of fans to react that way. It's a shame that 
the fans who were out there erupted and made a joke out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"It upset a lot of us." 
</P>
<P>
After some players ventured into the clubhouse to listen to radio reports and 
relayed the news of the decision, they reacted for the most part not with 
sadness or glee, but with shock. They could not believe The Boss would be gone. 
</P>
<P>
"We were prepared for a suspension, but this is way beyond what we were 
expecting," pitcher Andy Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Greg Cadaret grew speculative. "This place is going to be a zoo again 
for a couple days. Who knows if they're going to have a fire sale? The trading 
deadline is (today). They might define jobs better. The club's been in turmoil 
all year. You get tired of all the off-field distractions around here." 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Stump Merrill talked to his troops for about 10 minutes, then 
emerged from the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill seemed a bit choked up; Steinbrenner had given Merrill his greatest 
professional moment when he named him Yankee manager on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously for me, as a proud Yankee, it's a sad day," Merrill said. "The man 
has been great to me. He's meant a lot to me, and a lot to my family. I have 
nothing but respect for the guy. I have to go by the way he treated me. He has 
treated me with respect for 14 years." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Ferraro, a longtime Yankee employee, said, "I didn't think it would 
be this bad. I was thinking in terms of him possibly not being suspended or 
suspended for one year, but never being out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel badly for him. I know how much he wanted to win. I know how much he 
loved being a Yankee." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, no players expressed glee, despite the Yankees' recent problems. 
</P>
<P>
LaPoint went so far as to criticize the commissioner. "I think it's pretty 
severe," he said. "I think it's too harsh. (Steinbrenner) made some strange 
moves and signed some high-priced players. I think that had a lot to do with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Steve Sax and longtime Yankee relief ace Dave Righetti were 
sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping it wouldn't be that severe," Sax said. "He has been great to me 
and it started with my negotiations. When I hurt my leg he wouldn't let me 
drive my car. He sent a driver. Nobody did that, not the Dodgers. This is a 
drag." 
</P>
<P>
Said Righetti: "He tried to portray himself as the bad guy. But he's a man and 
he has feelings, too." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Barfield and rookie Oscar Azocar knocked in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Barfield hit a solo homer off Steve Searcy (1-2) and added a two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
Azocar hit his fourth homer in 14 major league games, a two-run shot in the 
fourth to give the Yankees a 3-2 lead.

COMPASSION SHOWN BY USOC MEMBERS; 
</P>
<P>
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE: MOST MEMBERS DON'T CRITICIZE STEINBRENNER, BELIEVING HE WILL 
'DO THE RIGHT THING.' 
</P>

Robert J. Kane, who as a former president of the U.S. Olympic Committee remains 
a member of the board of directors, was among the few dissenters when New York 
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner was elected as a USOC vice president in 
February of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But Kane, who often has been called the USOC's conscience since stepping down 
as president in 1981, said Monday that he has been "won over" by Steinbrenner's 
performance as a USOC officer. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a very different George Steinbrenner than I was led to believe," 
Kane said by telephone from his home in Ithaca, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"He has worked seriously and well with the USOC. He's done everything that he's 
been asked to do, not in a flamboyant way, not in the way he comes across with 
the Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
Kane, however, said that he is concerned that public support of the USOC might 
be eroded if the committee continues its association with Steinbrenner after 
major league baseball's action Monday against the Yankee owner. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this will sway public opinion," Kane said. "If he's banned from a 
profession, and it's an athletic profession, that, unfortunately, will have an 
effect. Sure, it will. 
</P>
<P>
"Public support is all important to us. Without it, we're out of business." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to speculate on current USOC President Robert Helmick's response, Kane 
said: "I have enough faith in George that I don't think Helmick will have to 
say anything. George is bright and intelligent. I'm not trying to evict George, 
but I feel he'll do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
A USOC spokesman said that Helmick will not comment until today. 
</P>
<P>
Neither did Steinbrenner comment Monday on his position with the USOC, but 
sources close to the Yankee owner said they did not believe he was inclined to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
As a public sector member of the USOC's executive board, Steinbrenner first 
moved to the forefront of the Olympic movement during the 1988 Winter Games, 
when he was named by Helmick to chair an overview commission. 
</P>
<P>
Assigned to recommend modifications in the USOC structure that would better 
serve athletes, the commission's report was generally well received by the 
House of Delegates in February of 1989. At that same meeting, Steinbrenner was 
elected one of three vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to Steinbrenner centered on his controversial reputation as Yankee 
owner and skepticism about his commitment to Olympic sports. But, based on the 
long line of USOC members who sought his autograph after the election, he had 
many more supporters than opponents. 
</P>
<P>
His fellow officers and other members of the board of directors since have 
praised him for his business acumen and leadership qualities. He also has been 
a generous financial contributor, even organizing and funding his own track and 
field club in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to compartmentalize your feelings," said USOC secretary Charles 
Foster of Duxbury, Mass. "What happened (Monday) was a baseball area. Then, 
there's the Olympic area. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an Olympic friend of his. Really, he has contributed a lot to the Olympic 
Committee. I would hate to see him go. I don't think any purpose would be 
served by it." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Kostanecki, one of 121 members of the board of directors, was a member 
of the nominating committee in 1988 that submitted Steinbrenner's name for 
consideration as vice president and said he remains supportive. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me sad that he's run into personal problems that seem to run deep," 
said Kostanecki, who is from New Canaan, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to say what's going to happen or what should happen. There's 
no question that the USOC is sensitive to public opinion. The Olympic movement 
sits on a pedestal. Therefore, we have a mode of behavior that has to be 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"But we also have to be fair. I suspect that whatever happens will be between 
Mr. Steinbrenner and Bob Helmick." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Edwards, a board member from Milwaukee who frequently criticizes USOC 
officers, said he would like to speak for Helmick in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say, 'George, I think for everyone involved, and the image of the U.S. 
Olympic Committee, you ought to resign,"' Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we can't afford that kind of publicity. I know we're not Simon 
pure, but you can't do just anything and remain a member of the Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be held accountable. George has to have a conscience and has to be 
embarrassed. If that happened to me, I'd move so far away that you'd have to 
pay $750 to send me a postcard." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards described himself as a "lone voice in the wilderness," but he had a 
least one companion in board member Don Porter of Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel George should never have been elected to an office in the first place," 
he said. "He's too controversial." 
</P>
<P>
He also took issue with those who believe Steinbrenner's impact on the USOC has 
been positive. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if he's done any good work ever for the USOC," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think George should seriously consider resigning in the interest of the 
people who have worked so hard on the USOC's behalf. It's my gut feeling that 
we might be better off without someone like that."

STEINBRENNER OWES $434,000 IN BACK STADIUM RENTAL FEES 
</P>

As if George Steinbrenner didn't have enough to worry about, now New York City 
officials are griping that he is tardy paying his bills. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say that Steinbrenner's New York Yankees still owe the city $434,000 
in stadium rental fees from 1987 and 1988, enough money for the city to buy 
17,000 textbooks for junior high school students or pay the salaries of 15 new 
police officers for a year. 
</P>
<P>
The team paid the city $1 million in March toward settling its 1987-88 bill. 
But, according to Michael Leonetti, chief accountant for the revenue division 
of the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, the Yankees are more than six 
months late on the balance due. 
</P>
<P>
Added Joanne Imohiosen, the department's assistant commissioner for revenue: 
"They're not prompt payers. But what are the alternatives? We obviously don't 
want them to leave the city." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Kleinman, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the 
Yankees, said that the team is contesting the amount of money it owes and 
described the money paid in March as a "good-faith" payment. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the parks department and the controller's office said that they 
were unaware of any dispute about the outstanding amount.

VINCENT'S ACTION IS CHEERED, BOOED BY FORMER YANKEES; 
</P>
<P>
REACTION: MEMORIES OF STEINBRENNER ARE COLORED BY WHETHER THEY ENJOYED THEIR 
LIVES IN PINSTRIPES.

<P>
At Yankee Stadium, they cheered. 
</P>
<P>
And in ballparks around the country, Yankee alumni sounded off with everything 
from unqualified support for Yankee owner George Steinbrenner to blatant glee 
at the news that he had been ordered to surrender control of his team by Fay 
Vincent, commissioner of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Few were willing to let Steinbrenner go quietly into the night. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he'd get out of it," said former Yankee and frequent Steinbrenner 
adversary Reggie Jackson in Minnesota, where he was working an Angel telecast. 
"I didn't think the sanctions would be this severe. That's about as bad as it 
can get. He (will become) a limited partner, and that's pretty limited." 
</P>
<P>
No regrets from Luis Polonia, traded by Steinbrenner to the Angels earlier this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"He deserved it," Polonia said. "If you own a baseball team, why don't you 
stick with your business, mind your business and not get into everyone else's 
business? This is the best thing for baseball and that team. I guess 
everybody's happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty sure now more people will be coming to the games. The players are 
going to enjoy it more because they're not going to have him on their backs. 
It's great. . . . I'm pretty sure all the guys there are happy. Whoever is 
going to be the manager of the Yankees now can relax and enjoy it. When he was 
out there, he was always on the manager's back. I hope they really keep him out 
of there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure a lot of people are throwing parties there right now. If I was on 
that team, I'd be throwing a party for not having him on my back anymore. I'm 
glad I'm here. I was happy to get out of New York. But if I was there, I'd be 
the happiest guy in the world tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Polonia's sentiments were not echoed, however, in San Diego, where support for 
Steinbrenner was unanimous among the former Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Padre first baseman Jack Clark, who left the St. Louis Cardinals after the 1987 
season for a three-year, $6-million contract with the Yankees that, in essence, 
broke the collusive activities between the owners and players, said that he 
always will respect Steinbrenner "for having the guts to go against the other 
owners. He was the only one who'd give me an offer. He didn't give a damn what 
all the other owners said. He just wanted a winner. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why this whole thing now is (horrible). It stinks." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Whitson, who left San Diego after the 1984 season to sign a five-year, 
$4.4-million Yankee contract and then asked Steinbrenner to trade him two years 
later, said: "This is a shock. I didn't think I'd ever see a day where George 
would agree to give up the Yankees. . . . A lot of people think George 
Steinbrenner was a bad man, but I'll tell you right now, I'll respect him to 
the day he dies. He's as honest as any man I've ever met." 
</P>
<P>
No argument from Padre third baseman Mike Pagliarulo, who was brought up in the 
Yankee organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, it's pretty tough to imagine," Pagliarulo said. "It's always been the 
New York Yankees and George Steinbrenner. To see him not there will be very 
strange. He was always good to me, and it really peeved me to see all these 
guys ripping him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was great with me. I remember when I hit my first home run, he sent me a 
big thing of champagne. And when I had my first son, he sent my wife flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Padre pitcher Dennis Rasmussen had two stints in the Yankee organization, but 
said he would have gone back. 
</P>
<P>
"I always enjoyed it there," he said. "But I never had to take the heat, 
either. That was always (Dave) Winfield, and some of the other free-agent 
players who took the heat. I'd play there again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what, though. There was never a dull moment. Every day was 
something. The writers always beat the players to the ballpark because they 
knew something would happen." 
</P>
<P>
Former Yankee Manager Lou Piniella, now managing the Cincinnati Reds, had no 
comment. And one of his players, Ken Griffey, another former Yankee, would only 
add, "I left that place. That's all I want to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Dodgers' Jay Howell, who also once wore Yankee pinstripes, "I haven't 
been reading about it, so I don't have anything to say. Even when I was playing 
in New York, I wouldn't read about Steinbrenner." 
</P>
<P>
The owners, as expected, backed their commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never any doubt in my mind that Commissioner Vincent would give Mr. 
Steinbrenner a fair hearing," Dodger owner Peter O'Malley said. "I support the 
commissioner's decision. The commissioner's ability to sanction those acting 
against the best interests of baseball is critical to maintain the integrity of 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
One dissenting voice belonged to Gabe Paul, who took over control of the 
Yankees in 1974 after Steinbrenner was suspended by then-Commissioner Bowie 
Kuhn for making illegal campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself "in shock" at Vincent's action, Paul told the Associated 
Press, "I think the commissioner gave into pressure, pressure of the media." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who had his share of battles with Steinbrenner during his years in New 
York, had not thought the Yankee owner would lose this one quite so decisively. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of surprised, but it seems as though this is final," Jackson said. 
"From what you know of George Steinbrenner, I didn't think he was going to take 
this sitting down. But it sounds as though it's final and that he made some 
kind of deal where he wouldn't sue." 
</P>
<P>
Was it a good deal for the game? 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, baseball winds up with a black eye here, the Yankees more than 
anything," Jackson said. "For the game, it's just a bruise. The game goes on. 
Nobody's too big in this game."

Billy Martin's widow has sued the man allegedly behind the wheel of the pickup 
truck in which the former New York Yankee manager was killed in a Christmas 
night accident. 
</P>
<P>
William Reedy, the owner of a Detroit bar, was negligent when he failed to 
negotiate a curve outside Martin's rural Upstate New York home and lost control 
of the truck, which slid down a ditch and into a culvert, Jill Martin's lawsuit 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, 61, a passenger in the truck, suffered fatal neck and head injuries in 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said a test administered to the 53-year-old Reedy soon after the 
accident indicated that he was legally drunk.

Deion Sanders has become a defensive back again, having left the New York 
Yankees for the rest of the baseball season to begin preparing to play football 
for the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm leaving. I'm going to football," said Sanders as he cleaned out his 
locker. "Maybe I'll be back next year with the Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, the Yankees and the Falcons had been involved in a wrangle over 
contracts and service responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
He had been seeking a $1-million contract for the 1991 baseball season, but the 
Yankees rejected that on Monday and broke off talks. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders was hitting .158 for the Yankees, the lowest average of any major 
leaguer with at least 125 at-bats.

Jari Kurri, who helped the Edmonton Oilers win five Stanley Cups and became the 
most prolific European scorer ever to play in the NHL, is off to Italy to play 
hockey, according to the Edmonton Sun. 
</P>
<P>
The right wing has signed a two-year deal to play with the Milan Devils of the 
Italian league that could make him the highest-paid player in European hockey 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Kurri, who became a free agent July 1, scored 474 goals and had 569 assists for 
1,043 points and an average of more than 100 points per season. His 92 playoff 
goals are the most in NHL history.

For the first time, New York Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly, plagued by a 
back problem, has mentioned retirement as an option. 
</P>
<P>
But only a final option. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd think about (retiring) hard," Mattingly was quoted as saying in Monday's 
New York Daily News. "It depends on what (the doctors) tell me. But if I can't 
be myself and be productive, then I won't keep playing. I would walk away from 
it. But I'll be fine. I'm not done." 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly, who is resting at his home in Evansville, Ind., was put on the 
21-day disabled list Thursday because of a bulging degenerative disk. 
</P>
<P>
He is planning a trip to Los Angeles to be examined by Robert Watkins, the 
specialist who performed successful back surgery on Dave Winfield and who is 
treating Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly, who in April agreed to a guaranteed, five-year, $19.3-million 
contract extension through 1995, is hitting only .245 this year. He has not hit 
a home run since May 20.

FUJITSU WILL BUY CONTROL OF U.K. COMPUTER FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: THE PURCHASE OF 80% OF INTERNATIONAL COMPUTERS LTD. MAY SIGNAL THE 
START OF MERGERS BETWEEN EUROPE'S STRUGGLING FIRMS AND CASH-RICH JAPANESE 
COMPANIES. 
</P>

Fujitsu, Japan's leading computer maker, said Monday that it will buy a 
controlling share of Britain's top computer manufacturer in the first major 
purchase of a European computer company by the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Fujitsu's purchase of 80% of International Computers Ltd. for $1.2 billion 
expands the Japanese company's growing reach in the global market for 
computers, semiconductors and other high-technology products and automatically 
makes it one of Europe's leading computer makers, well ahead of the creation of 
a single European market in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase also allows Fujitsu, the world's third-largest computer maker, to 
replace Digital Equipment Corp. of Maynard, Mass. in the No. 2 spot, behind 
International Business Machines. 
</P>
<P>
In the works for the past 18 months and widely rumored during the past 10 days, 
the deal, however, has ramifications far beyond the immediate participants. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they expect additional deals between Europe's struggling computer 
industry and cash-rich Japanese companies eager to expand without the expense 
and trouble of establishing local subsidiaries. Further, analysts noted, the 
Fujitsu deal is sure to sharpen competition for IBM, the world's No. 1 computer 
maker and a leading force in the European computer market. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe is changing its attitudes toward the Japanese and beginning to accept 
them in their computer markets," said Ulrich Weil, a technology analyst in 
Washington. "And there are sure to be more changes ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Fujitsu purchase of ICL is the largest deal of its kind, it is not 
the first. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mitsubishi purchased Apricot Systems, a small British 
personal computer maker. In addition, several other European electronics 
companies have ties to larger Japanese firms. For example, NEC Corp. has a 15% 
stake in a subsidiary of the French company, Cie. des Machines Bull, and 
Hitachi Ltd. has links with Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Before its 80% purchase of ICL, Fujitsu had a nine-year technology-sharing 
agreement with the British company. But until the latest deal, Fujitsu's 
European operations consisted of a computer manufacturing plant in Spain and a 
semiconductor-making plant in Ireland, as well as a semiconductor marketing 
operation throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is becoming increasingly clear for companies throughout the 
world," said Michael Borrus of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International 
Economy. "If you're not already in Europe with your own operations, and you 
want to be a global player, you're going to have to find a partner in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Among those most often mentioned as potential European partners are the ailing 
computer operations of Philips N.V., the Dutch electronics company; the sagging 
computer operations of Bull of France, and the erratically performing computer 
operations of Italy's Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
Although analysts said the full effects from the growing presence of Japanese 
companies in Europe will not be seen for years, the latest deal makes Japan a 
major player in the European mainframe computer market for the first time by 
giving them the dominant market share position in Britain. However, because 
ICL, whose sales last year were approximately $2.9 billion, has only a small 
market presence beyond Britain, analysts said Fujitsu will be on its own as it 
attempts to expand its European operations. 
</P>
<P>
And Fujitsu left little question that it would expand its operations. "We look 
forward to promoting the ICL name vigorously in its key markets," Takuma 
Yamamoto, Fujitsu's chairman, said at a London press conference. 
</P>
<P>
ICL's principal markets have been British governmental agencies and retailers, 
and its market share in that country is said to be second only to IBM.

Construction Spending: Spending for new construction dipped in June but showed 
signs of stabilizing after a volatile first half, according to a study by F. W. 
Dodge, a financial information division of McGraw-Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Dodge said its index of new construction contracts fell in June to 153 from 156 
in May. Spending for new construction totaled $240.72 billion in June, compared 
to May's $245.71 billion. Despite the overall decline, Dodge found evidence 
that construction spending was leveling off after having fallen to a four-year 
low in April as builders found financing harder to come by.

T-Bill Rates Mixed: The Treasury sold $9.3 billion of new three-month bills at 
an average discount rate of 7.50%, up from 7.49% last week. Another $9.2 
billion in new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.37%, 
down from 7.40% last week. 
</P>
<P>
The three-month bill rate was the highest since the 7.62% rate of July 16. The 
six-month bill rate was the lowest since averaging 7.30% last Dec. 4. The new 
discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.75% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,810.40 and 7.76% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,627.40. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.

FDA PANEL DELAYS DECISION ON CETUS' PROLEUKIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Food and Drug Administration panel Monday dealt a blow to loss-weary Cetus 
Corp. when it postponed a decision on the firm's application to market 
Proleukin, its costliest and most important product, to treat kidney cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, whose recommendations are almost always accepted by the FDA, said it 
needed more time to review data that Cetus submitted as late as last Friday and 
would probably request additional meetings between Cetus officials and FDA 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
The delay, although not as devastating as an outright denial, is at best 
greatly frustrating to Cetus, the Emeryville, Calif.-based biotechnology 
company that has invested more than $100 million developing Proleukin. 
Proleukin is a genetically engineered form of Interleukin-2, a protein that 
regulates the immune system. The company still has cash reserves but lately has 
admitted a great need for revenue from Proleukin. 
</P>
<P>
After the four-hour panel review, Cetus Chief Executive Robert A. Fildes said 
"this product can play a significant role in altering the dismal progress of 
kidney cancer for many patients. We continue to believe that this drug should 
be licensed quickly. . . . It is a tragedy that Americans do not have access to 
a drug developed in the United States that is already approved in nine European 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
The postponement also is a damper on the financial community's hopes that four 
biotech drug reviews this week would reignite enthusiasm in biotechnology 
issues. But in heavy over-the-counter trading Monday, the price of Cetus stock 
closed down $1.75 cents at $14.125. More than 3 million shares were traded. 
</P>
<P>
The panel did recommend approval, however, for Genentech to market its gamma 
interferon to a very narrow class of patients who suffer from an inherited 
immune system disorder called chronic granulomatous disease. 
</P>
<P>
Each FDA application is seen as a first step for these drugs, all belonging to 
the family of immune system regulators. This group of proteins is viewed by 
scientists and researchers as holding great potential for widespread use in the 
treatment of cancers and other pernicious diseases. For the companies, they are 
viewed as the products that could finally lift the biotechnology business out 
of a morass of red ink. 
</P>
<P>
For Cetus, the trouble has been in finding the one application for Proleukin 
that will produce the best results and win its first FDA approval. Some critics 
have accused Cetus of "shopping for a disease" to fit its cure. Interleukin-2 
has been in several different clinical trials since Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the 
prestigious National Cancer Institute began first tests on humans in early 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Proleukin has been controversial because it has shown only moderate success 
while producing serious side effects. The FDA's dilemma is to balance that 
against the glum outlook for patients without the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of Proleukin in European countries and Cetus' other revenues are not 
substantial enough to offset its costs in developing the product, said Steven 
Gerber, biotech analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. And 
without U.S. approval, European sales could flatten or even fall off. 
</P>
<P>
The approval would open an estimated $20 million to $40 million annual market 
to Cetus, and Gerber called that "crucial for the company. . . . If approval, 
for example, is delayed for six months, well, the timing is less crucial than 
the fact of approval." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BIOTECH PRODUCTS BEING CONSIDERED 
</P>
<P>
Products and action on the FDA Advisory Committee agenda: 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY: 
</P>
<P>
* Delays making a recommendation on Cetus' application to market interleukin-2 
drug for treatment of kidney cancer. 
</P>
<P>
* Recommends approval for Genentech to market its gamma interferon, Actimmune, 
for treatment of a rare disorder. 
</P>
<P>
TUESDAY: 
</P>
<P>
* Considers application by Immunex to market its version of a "colony 
stimulating factor" for use in bone marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
* Considers application by Schering-Plough to market Intron, an alpha 
interferon licensed from Biogen, for use in treating hepatitis-C patients.

DISNEY GROUP AGREES TO BUY CHILD WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trefoil Capital Investors, a Burbank partnership recently formed by Roy E. 
Disney's Shamrock Holdings Inc. to invest in ailing companies, said Monday that 
it has agreed to buy toy retailer Child World Inc. in a two-step transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Trefoil would first acquire the 82% stake in Child World that is owned by 
debt-laden CNC Holding Corp., a Cleveland-based retail concern, in exchange for 
assuming an undisclosed amount of CNC's debt, said Stanley P. Gold, head of 
Trefoil's general partner and Shamrock's president. Trefoil then plans to buy 
the remaining 18% stake held by the public for $14 a share, or $28.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that CNC's stake also carries a $14-a-share value, the total deal 
would have an indicated value of $157.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Child World, an Avon, Mass.-based company, has 175 stores in 31 states and is 
the nation's second-largest toy chain behind Toys R Us. There are no Child 
World stores in Southern California, but the company had previously announced 
plans to expand here over an unspecified period. 
</P>
<P>
Both Child World and CNC have been struggling recently. Child World's profit 
last year fell 54% to $5.83 million from $12.6 million in 1988, despite an 
increase in sales to $830.3 million from $807.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Child World's stock has been volatile since May, when it was disclosed that CNC 
was negotiating to sell its stake. The stock jumped $1 a share Friday to $14, 
and closed Monday at $13.75 in over-the-counter trading, meaning that Trefoil 
currently is offering little premium over the stock's market price. But Gold 
said Trefoil is "paying a fair price" for the company. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase of Child World would mark the first major deal for Shamrock's 
executives since they made a failed, $3-billion bid to acquire Polaroid Corp. 
in early 1989. They recently raised $450 million from investors to fund 
Trefoil. 
</P>
<P>
Trefoil plans to look closely at retailers because of Shamrock's experience in 
the industry. Shamrock's holdings include the 71-store Music Plus chain of 
music and video stores in Southern California and the 140-outlet Sound 
Warehouse chain based in Dallas. It also owns three television and 15 radio 
stations.

LABOR: WIN COULD HURT EASTERN STRIKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Embattled strikers at Eastern Airlines won a nice little psychological victory 
last week, but it could end up doing them more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
The victory came when a federal grand jury indicted the airline and 10 former 
and current Eastern managers on criminal conspiracy charges, alleging that they 
put the lives of passengers at risk by keeping fraudulent maintenance and 
safety records. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments mirrored long-ignored charges by the employees' unions, the 
International Assn. of Machinists and the Air Line Pilots Assn. 
</P>
<P>
And government officials are stressing that the Eastern investigation, headed 
by Andrew Maloney, the U.S. Attorney in New York, is not over. 
</P>
<P>
That means that it may finally involve the man the union workers hate most: 
Frank Lorenzo, head of Eastern's parent, Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. 
Neither Lorenzo nor other top Eastern executives were indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Government agencies responsible for airline safety had generally dismissed the 
unions' charges as labor propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
Even more reprehensible was former Transportation Secretary James Burnley, a 
Reagan appointee who repeatedly accused Eastern's unions of playing politics 
with their charges. Finally, his department gave Eastern a clean bill of health 
on safety just four months before he resigned his post to join a law firm 
representing Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
But the grand jury vindication of the unions' allegations won't end the long, 
bitter strike against Eastern, which is still owned mostly by Lorenzo, one of 
the nation's most ruthless anti-union executives. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the grand jury's action might make it more difficult for Northwest 
Airlines Chairman Alfred Checchi or someone like him to rescue the strikers by 
buying part or all of Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi is in discussions with Eastern and its creditors' advisers about 
Northwest taking over some of Eastern's assets and then helping sell other 
parts of the company. 
</P>
<P>
It could be a good buy because Eastern still has valuable assets, especially 
its gates and routes in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
But if Eastern is maintained as a separate airline, a buyer will have to 
overcome the damaging publicity that goes along with those criminal 
indictments, in addition to the problems caused by continuing labor turmoil at 
Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
And waiting in the wings are the Eastern pilots, who claim that they have 
evidence for the grand jury showing that there was a cover-up of past unsafe 
practices in the actual flying of the planes. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the grand jury investigation has dealt only with alleged unsafe 
maintenance of planes while they were on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the pilots succeed in proving their allegation, it might make 
Eastern even less attractive to Checchi or some other buyer. 
</P>
<P>
The last union victory came a few months ago when a bankruptcy judge kicked 
Lorenzo out as Eastern's chief executive. It was a move the unions had demanded 
because Lorenzo provoked the machinists' strike by demanding drastic wage and 
benefit cuts after the workers had already accepted substantial reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Then Lorenzo "permanently replaced" most of the strikers and the pilots and 
flight attendants who honored the machinists' picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the machinists went on strike in March, 1989, Lorenzo put Eastern 
into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy to stave off creditors, keep the airline flying 
and break the unions. 
</P>
<P>
The ouster of Lorenzo was the first labor victory in the long dispute, and 
things looked even better for the strikers when the court appointed Martin 
Shugrue as trustee to run the company. 
</P>
<P>
Known as an executive who worked well with unionized workers, Shugrue promised 
to make compromises with the unions to end the strike and bring labor peace to 
the troubled airline. 
</P>
<P>
But negotiations stalled quickly because no way has been found to end the 
dispute since Shugrue so far has refused to get rid of the strikebreakers and 
rehire the strikers that Lorenzo still insists have been "permanently 
replaced." 
</P>
<P>
At present, only the machinists are officially on strike; they struck March 4, 
1989. But now the pilots are threatening to call their own strike because 
contract negotiations are deadlocked over the issue of the strikebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
The best way out of Eastern's current mess would be for the unions and Shugrue 
to agree on new contracts, which would be possible if Shugrue rehires Eastern's 
experienced employees who have fought and sacrificed so long in their battle 
against Lorenzo's unrelenting union-busting tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Ending the labor war would make it easier to sell the company and possibly 
merge it with another airline, such as Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
One tangible gain for the unions did come out of the grand jury indictments 
against Eastern and some of its officers. 
</P>
<P>
Although their allegations of dangerous safety practices had been ignored by 
the Department of Transportation and most other government agencies, Lorenzo 
took them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
He filed a $1.5-billion suit against the unions, complaining that their 
allegations were lies meant to smear the company's name and frighten passengers 
away. 
</P>
<P>
His lawsuit has been weakened badly if not destroyed by the grand jury 
indictments, since they support the unions' charges. 
</P>
<P>
Even before that suit and the unions' countersuits are dropped, though, Shugrue 
and the unions must concentrate on getting contract agreements that would 
settle the long labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of picket lines and the return of experienced Eastern workers to 
their jobs in the air and on the ground could help make a success of the 
company's costly advertising campaign to reassure the traveling public about 
Eastern's safety. 
</P>
<P>
And that, in turn, should make Eastern a good deal for any prospective buyer.

U.S. fast-food giant McDonald's unveiled plans Monday to open its first outlet 
in East Germany, but found that its global hamburger empire was not to 
everyone's taste. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and city politicians are hostile to the move. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin's City Council refused permission for a mobile McDonald's burger 
stand in the Alexanderplatz, saying it wanted to cut down on street traders in 
its main square. Members of Parliament have objected to the restaurants, citing 
disposal problems with fast-food containers.

PEOPLE: 'SESAME STREET' PRODUCER JOAN COONEY TO STEP DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Ganz Cooney, who helped create Children's Television Workshop, the company 
that produced "Sesame Street" and other educational series, will step down as 
chief executive this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Cooney, who will become chairman of the executive committee of the company's 
board, will be succeeded by David V. V. Britt, who currently is president and 
chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
"This seems to me the right moment in CTW's life and my own to make a change," 
Cooney said. "I look forward to continuing to work with David and all of the 
other talented people at CTW." 
</P>
<P>
Besides "Sesame Street," a program seen on more than 300 stations of the Public 
Broadcasting Service, the company also produces "3-2-1 Contact," a science 
program, and "Square One TV," a mathematics show. 
</P>
<P>
Cooney in 1966 undertook the feasibility and planning study for Carnegie Corp., 
which led to the creation of "Sesame Street." She was elected president and 
chief executive when the company was incorporated as a nonprofit organization 
in 1970. She was elected chairman and CEO in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Britt, 53, joined the company in 1971, following government service in 
Washington. In 1974 he became assistant to the president, and in 1988 he was 
named president and chief operating officer.

DOW UP 18.82 AS OILS, UTILITIES IGNITE BLUE CHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oil and utility stocks led a blue chip rally Monday, while the broad market was 
mixed on fresh concern about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed 18.82 points higher at 2,917.33. But 
declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8-to-7 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 717 up, 792 down and 499 unchanged. 
Big Board volume totaled 146.47 million shares, compared to 149.07 million on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow was off more than 20 points early on, still smarting from Friday's weak 
gross national product figures for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that people have gotten a lot more nervous in the last week," said 
Andrew Riley, strategist at Yamaichi International. "The GNP figures pointed 
out the economy is a little weaker than what people thought it had been." 
</P>
<P>
But that weakness also has raised hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut 
interest rates further, to stave off recession. New optimism about rates fueled 
a bond rally Monday and drove up some utility stocks, which are viewed as stock 
proxies for bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow utility index jumped 3.70 points, or 1.8%, to 207.05. Southern Co. rose 
5/8 to 25 7/8, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric gained 5/8 to 22 5/8 and Con Ed added 
1 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, oil stocks strengthened from the opening and extended their gains 
throughout the day on a positive outlook for oil prices. Smith Barney analyst 
Michael Young repeated his buy rating on five oil stocks, including Arco, which 
was up 2 3/4 to 127 3/4, and Texaco, which was up 1 3/8 to 62 7/8. Other 
gainers included Exxon, up 1 1/2 to 50 3/4, and Baker Hughes, up 3/4 to a new 
52-week high of 31. 
</P>
<P>
But selling continued to hit many stocks, including smaller issues. The NASDAQ 
over-the-counter composite index fell 3.21 points to 439.38, off 0.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* A published report that Chemical Bank is withdrawing from the financing deal 
for UAL caused UAL shares to tumble 6 1/8 to 156 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* High-tech losers included AST Research, off 1 to 22 3/8, Conner Peripherals, 
off 1 to 26 1/2, Marshall Industries, down 1 1/2 to 25 3/8, and Honeywell, down 
1 1/2 to 103. 
</P>
<P>
* Outside of tech, growth stocks were mixed. Disney rebounded 1 7/8 to 117 7/8 
and Philip Morris rose 7/8 to 47 1/2. But Circus Circus lost 3 1/8 to 59 7/8 
and Waste Management fell 1 to 41 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Some retailers were hit on fresh concerns about consumer spending. Building 
materials retailer Lowe's Cos. lost 4 to 32 5/8, as investors continued to 
pound the stock. Elsewhere, Gap fell 1 to 57 7/8; Home Depot lost 1 to 35 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Teledyne gained 1 3/4 to 22, possibly on new rumors about the potential sale 
of its stakes in Litton and Curtiss-Wright. Litton rose 1 3/4 to 72; Curtiss 
rose 3 3/8 to 68 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Among S&amp;Ls, HomeFed rebounded 1 3/8 to 11 3/8, after a battering last 
week. Meanwhile, CalFed lost 1 1/2 to a new low of 11 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Broad Inc. fell 5/8 to 9 3/8. The financial services firm reported 
third-quarter earnings up 14%, but said fiscal 1990 earnings may fall short of 
its target by $1.20 a share because of investment losses. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, shares fell sharply in thin trading for the seventh day running. The 
Nikkei average lost 420.53 points or 1.4% to 30,442.95 after losing 506.27 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times 100-share index fell 13.6 points to 2,316.5. 
Shares also ended weaker in Frankfurt: The DAX index closed down 8.12 points at 
1,911.69. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Bonds Rise on Belief That Rates Will Fall 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices surged higher for the second-straight session Monday, boosted by 
the belief that the Federal Reserve, faced with a slowing economy, will be 
forced to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 25/32, or about $7.81 per $1,000 
face amount, after gaining 11/16 Friday. The bond's yield dropped to 8.40% from 
Friday's 8.47%. The yield was at 8.57% a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders snapped up bonds on the belief that the country is closer 
to a recession than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
The investor attitude is that "we're teetering on the edge of recession, and 
with that, rates have only one way to go -- down," said William V. Sullivan, 
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 7.938%, down from 8% Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Continues Its Recent Tailspin 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell broadly against major foreign currencies, continuing a drop 
prompted by a weakening U.S. economy and the prospect of lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Global investors don't think the dollar is very attractive right now," said 
Earl I. Johnson, a vice president with Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the dollar closed at its lowest level since June, 1988, against 
the West German mark and at about a two-year low against the British pound. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar ended at 1.6045 German marks, down from 1.6115 Friday, 
and at 147.85 yen, versus Friday's close of 149.00. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Mendell, a vice president with Security Pacific National Bank in Los 
Angeles, said that as differences in global interest rates have narrowed, rates 
of return for investors in Europe and Japan have become higher or comparable to 
those in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gold fell 20 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $367.80 
an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Talk of Stockpiling Halts Copper Surge 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures prices fell sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange, ending a 
four-day rally amid speculation that London warehouse stocks of the metal have 
grown. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures settled 0.80 cent to 2.35 cents lower, with the contract for 
delivery in August off 2.3 cents to $1.244 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The copper market had risen strongly in five of the six previous sessions, 
including the last four, on concerns about relatively tight supplies and a 
strike that began Thursday against the state-owned Peruvian mining and refining 
company, Mineroperu. 
</P>
<P>
But the strike was settled over the weekend, and analysts believe that demand 
for copper may be easing, based on indications that warehouse stocks documented 
by the London Metal Exchange rose in the past week. The London exchange's 
report on warehouse stocks is due out today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crude oil prices staged a moderate rally in lackluster trading, with 
the market pondering the aftermath of last week's OPEC meeting in Geneva. On 
the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures for September delivery 
gained 17 cents to close at $20.21 a barrel.

CURB ON PHONE, FAX 'JUNK MAIL' OKD BY HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to public protest over high tech "junk mail," the House on Monday 
approved a bill to allow telephone customers to block unsolicited 
computer-generated sales pitches and to keep advertising off their fax 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, passed by voice vote, was sent to the Senate, where similar 
legislation may be passed before Congress adjourns this fall. The legislation 
is opposed by the Bush Administration as an overly drastic remedy for a "small 
number of complaints," although it has not issued a veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals, police and fire departments and citizens have demanded action to 
stop the tie-up of their phones by commercial messages that refuse to quit even 
when the recipient hangs up the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
However, telemarketing firms contend that only a few unprincipled operators are 
responsible for abuses and oppose legislation as a restriction on their right 
to communicate with potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
If enacted, the restrictions could affect as many as 7 million automatically 
dialed telephone commercials each day. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill would require the Federal Communications Commission to establish 
a national list of telephone customers who object to receiving recorded 
commercials on their phones or advertising on their fax machines. Telemarketing 
firms then would have to obtain the lists, at their own expense, and would be 
barred from sending messages to numbers on it. Telephone solicitation of those 
who did not put their name on the list would not be prohibited, unless they 
have an unlisted number. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would also ban computer-generated calls to public safety agencies, 
cellular phones and paging devices. 
</P>
<P>
Automatically dialed calls on behalf of political and charitable organizations 
would be exempted from the proposed restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the toughest possible bill we could pass," said Rep. Edward J. Markey 
(D-Mass.), chief sponsor of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"Many consumers complain bitterly that, when (the phone) rings to deliver 
unsolicited advertising, it is invading their privacy," he added. "This 
legislation empowers consumers and businesses with the ability to 'just say 
no.' " 
</P>
<P>
Legislatures in 27 states have considered or passed restrictions on automatic 
dialing of commercials used by more than 180,000 business firms to solicit 
customers. And at least two states recently have approved laws to forbid 
unsolicited ads over fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
California has no law governing transmission of unsolicited material over fax 
machines. Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed a bill passed by the Legislature last 
year that would have made the practice illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the nation's estimated 2 million fax machine owners have been inundated 
with increasing numbers of unsolicited ads, known as "junk fax." Recipients are 
forced to underwrite the cost of the advertisements through machine time and 
paper. The unwanted ads often tie up fax machines needed to receive materials 
that the fax owners do want. 
</P>
<P>
"Businesses dependent on the fax machine to carry vital information have come 
to decry unsolicited advertising that results in costs to and interference with 
business activities," Markey said. 
</P>
<P>
The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which recommended the federal 
legislation, said that telemarketing firms were able to avoid state laws by 
routing their calls over interstate long-distance lines outside the scope of 
state regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration said that the FCC and the states already have adequate 
authority to address complaints about "junk fax" and unsolicited telephone ads. 
Compiling a list of persons who object to those practices would impose 
"substantial costs and burdens," according to a statement of Administration 
policy made public by the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It has not been demonstrated that less drastic administrative remedies are 
insufficient," the Administration statement said.

HUNDREDS DIE IN MASSACRE BY LIBERIAN TROOPS; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL WAR: AS MANY AS 600 REFUGEES ARE KILLED IN A CHURCH. SURVIVORS SAY THE 
SOLDIERS WERE PRESIDENT DOE'S.

MONROVIA, Liberia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troops loyal to Liberian President Samuel K. Doe massacred at least 600 
refugees, including babies in their mothers' arms, in the sanctuary of a church 
where they had fled for safety in war-torn Monrovia, witnesses said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials in Washington said late Monday that their 
information, based on reports from U.S. Embassy staff members still in 
Monrovia, put the death toll closer to 200. 
</P>
<P>
Doe said rebel guerrillas in government uniforms committed the atrocity, but 
the United States discounted this version. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors of the attack said about 30 government soldiers burst into St. 
Peter's Lutheran Church on the outskirts of the city Sunday evening and 
butchered men, women, children and babies with guns, knives and machetes. 
</P>
<P>
The entire floor of the church was thick with bloodstains, and bodies were 
found under pews where people had tried to hide. The bodies of boys aged 7 or 8 
were draped on the church altar, and a pile of bodies was half-hidden in a dark 
corner beside the altar. 
</P>
<P>
Dead women lay on the floor with children still wrapped in shawls on their 
backs. The church crucifix had been thrown to the ground, and bullet holes 
riddled the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Bodies of some people apparently killed while trying to flee were hanging from 
the window frames of the building, said one person who visited the church. 
</P>
<P>
"My people, help me. My son -- where is my son? I beg you, don't leave me," 
pleaded an injured woman lying on the church steps. A man nearby, his neck 
slashed, called out for water. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 refugees had taken shelter in the church since rebel forces, 
fighting a seven-month-old civil war to oust Doe, reached Monrovia three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said the soldiers broke down the church door by firing machine 
guns into it and then opened fire on the refugees point-blank. Witnesses said 
the soldiers then went to the upper floor of the compound and shot at hundreds 
of refugees sleeping there. 
</P>
<P>
There is no phone in the church, so victims had no way of calling for help. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers ordered some women who tried to flee with their children to stand 
aside. Other soldiers then fired on them. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought they had come to ask us questions. Then they started killing, and 
everyone began screaming and trying to hide," said one man who hid in the 
church attic during the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the church compound was filled with the bodies brought outside after 
the massacre. People passing the church appeared numb at the sight of rows of 
corpses. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors said the soldiers were from Doe's Krahn tribe while most of the 
refugees were from the Gio and Mano tribes, staunch supporters of the rebel 
armies. The rebels now control most of Monrovia and are poised to move in to 
overthrow Doe, guarded by a few hundred soldiers at his seafront executive 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration issued a statement condemning massacre, calling it a 
"senseless act of terror" and blaming it on forces controlled by President Doe. 
</P>
<P>
Doe's government blamed the massacre on rebel soldiers disguised in government 
uniforms. But U.S. officials insisted that "our indications are that it was 
government troops that were involved," according to Deputy Press Secretary 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials said President Bush had no plans to send U.S. 
military forces to Liberia to stabilize the situation, as some diplomats and 
Liberian leaders had urged over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're asking whether we're going to intervene, we're not going to," said 
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. "We don't think our role is to 
intervene in the conflict directly." 
</P>
<P>
The massacre was the latest atrocity in an increasingly bloody three-cornered 
civil war involving Doe's forces and two rebel groups, one headed by Prince 
Johnson, a former lieutenant in Doe's army, and Charles Taylor, a former senior 
official in Doe's government. The three forces each claim several thousand men 
under arms and each draw strength from different tribal groupings within the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson split with Taylor months ago, and his fighters invaded the capital last 
week and advanced to within a mile of the presidential mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson indicated Monday he had no intention of working with Taylor. In a 
meeting with foreign correspondents in Monrovia, he accused Taylor of being a 
Libyan-backed socialist and said he had received $8 million in aid from Libyan 
leader Moammar Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not going to come here now and make himself president. I will meet 
Taylor after Doe is overthrown. I don't want power, I want a fair election. 
Taylor will manipulate the election," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said: "I will get Doe. He is not going to get away." Johnson claims to 
have 7,000 men under his command, including 4,000 deserters from Doe's army.

TRINIDAD CRISIS PERSISTS AFTER TALKS COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An end to Trinidad's hostage crisis drew tantalizingly close Monday, but 
negotiations collapsed at the 11th hour as renewed gunfire was heard at the 
Parliament building, where the prime minister of this twin-island nation and 
about 45 other people are being held captive. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials had called an evening news conference to announce the 
imminent release of the hostages and freedom for their black Muslim captors, 
but as the conference began an embarrassed official declared: "We came here 
expecting to give you word of an agreement, but as of now we cannot." 
</P>
<P>
"We're back to square one," conceded Maj. Dave Williams, a spokesman for the 
Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force. 
</P>
<P>
As Williams spoke, there was a prolonged burst of gunfire from the vicinity of 
Red House, the Parliament building where wounded Prime Minister A. N. R. 
Robinson has been held by rebellious Muslims since Friday evening. Also being 
held are Cabinet ministers, members of Parliament and others. 
</P>
<P>
Later, some wire services reported that Robinson and the chief negotiator for 
the Muslim extremists said they had reached agreement to end the standoff. But 
Williams denied that an agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfight broke out after negotiations already had become snagged over a 
demand by rebels in Red House to take their loaded weapons with them into 
officially approved sanctuary at their nine-acre religious enclave in Mucurapo, 
north of Port of Spain, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
In a confused series of announcements, government spokesmen Monday first 
estimated the number of hostages at up to 100, then scaled the number back to 
60 to 80, and finally, late Monday, issued what they called a "firm figure" of 
41. 
</P>
<P>
The government's chief information officer, Gregory Shaw, said there are 25 
hostages in the television building and 16 at Red House. The Red House hostages 
number eight government ministers, including Robinson, six other members of 
Parliament, the former ambassador to London and a top civil servant. 
</P>
<P>
As for hostage takers, Williams said they are believed to number about 45 in 
Red House and 75 in the television complex, where a prolonged gun battle 
involving rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and automatic weapons erupted at 
mid-morning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The morning clash occurred when some of the hostage takers attempted to shoot 
their way out of the television annex building and were driven back inside by 
troops who have surrounded both hostage sites, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
He had no explanation of the renewed gunfire around Red House, which occurred 
shortly before the beginning of a 6 p.m.-to-noon curfew Monday night. But the 
occurrence of two armed clashes at a time when the government felt it was 
making progress in negotiations for the release of the hostages suggested a 
pessimistic outlook, at least in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it remained uncertain whether negotiations with the rebels, which began 
Saturday, were still in progress Monday night. Government spokesman Shaw, said 
only that "up to this time (7 p.m. Monday local time), the government has not 
agreed to demands of the group that have been holding the prime minister and 
his colleagues and other persons at gunpoint since they burst into Parliament 
Friday evening." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw stressed several times that "intensive efforts are continuing to ensure 
the safety" of the hostages. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that Knolly Clarke, an Anglican clergyman who talked to Robinson 
by telephone Monday, reported that the prime minister told him he would be the 
last to leave Red House, only after all the other hostages were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also said Robinson had been shot in both feet but was reported in 
stable condition and under treatment by Dr. Emmanuel Hosein, the health 
minister and a fellow hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Although some pillaging of stores and shopping centers continued Monday, Port 
of Spain and its environs appeared calm. Officials clamped a 24-hour curfew on 
the capital's center, where the hostage sites are located, and a 6 p.m.-to-noon 
curfew on the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasts from the one radio station still operating stressed that "security 
personnel have shoot-on-sight instructions" for dealing with looters, who 
already have plundered an estimated $50 million worth of goods. 
</P>
<P>
The total number of casualties remained uncertain, but a local newspaper, the 
Express, said city hospitals reported 314 persons treated for injuries. A total 
of 169 required surgery, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams minimized casualties in the Defense Force, saying only that three 
soldiers had been hit, none seriously, by gunfire. He said he believed six of 
the hostage takers, all members of the Jamaat al Muslimeen black Muslim group, 
had been killed. Unofficial estimates of the number dead in Port of Spain ran 
as high as 100. 
</P>
<P>
The black Muslim group, long a focus of concern to the government because of 
what it perceived as the organization's tendency toward violence, is itself 
showing signs of schism, Shaw and Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams cited the attempted breakout at the television complex at a time when 
the Red House hostage takers appeared to be in agreement with the government as 
evidence of what he called "some degree of splintering in the ranks of the 
hostage takers." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the Red House group appeared to have broken ranks with the television 
group when they began demanding the right to keep their arms -- the demand that 
caused the hoped-for agreement to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, as outlined by the government spokesman, the television 
complex and Red House captors would be granted amnesty and be allowed to return 
in stages to their Islamic religious commune, itself a source of longstanding 
conflict with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the first step would be release of the television hostages, who 
would be taken to the Trinidadian army's Camp Ogden for physical and 
psychiatric examination. Their captors would then be freed to return unarmed to 
their commune. Next, the hostages in Red House would be released in the same 
fashion and their captors freed to go back to the Muslim enclave in Mucurapo. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the failed agreement included any conditions requiring the resignation 
of Robinson and appointment of an interim government including Muslim leader 
Yasin abu Bakr, the spokesmen said they were "not aware of any such condition 
being on the table." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a clear account of events from the government or local news 
outlets, rumors abounded. Among them was a report that a battalion of troops 
from the Jamaica Defense Force had been flown in from Kingston to assist local 
forces in policing the capital, as well as a rumor that some American troops 
had landed. 
</P>
<P>
Both were denied by Col. Ralph Brown, commander of the Trinidad and Tobago 
Defense Force. "We've got things under control, and we don't need any help," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader, Bakr, has been the center of controversy since 1985, when he 
founded the black Muslim group on the premise that "the nation was corrupt in 
the hands of evil men," said the Express newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Following a stint in jail for contempt of court, Bakr went to Libya and formed 
close ties to that country's radical leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi. Following his 
return to the islands, Bakr was arrested after a police raid uncovered an arms 
cache at the Muslim commune. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy flared again last year when the government charged that his 
group was occupying the commune illegally and sent a crew to demolish some 
buildings there. Last week, just three days before he led the hostage-taking 
raid on the television complex and Parliament building, Bakr lost a high-court 
test to claim rights to the land. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House and State Department spokesmen both emphasized that 
the estimated 6,000 American citizens in Trinidad and Tobago, most of them 
tourists, appeared to be in no immediate danger. However, the U.S. Embassy 
issued an advisory suggesting that Americans on the island remain indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Violence in the country appears to be restricted to the capital, White House 
Deputy Press Secretary Steve Hart noted. 
</P>
<P>
Officials refused to comment on reports that American naval vessels were in the 
vicinity of the islands, although the Navy routinely keeps several ships in a 
large naval training area nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials noted the ties between Libya and the group holding the 
hostages, but added that no evidence exists of Libyan involvement in the 
current attack.

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400,000 Muslims make the Caribbean their home. But most are East Indians 
who disdain the radical politics of black Muslims such as those holding 
Trinidad's government hostage. Many East Indians consider black Muslims to be 
political opportunists, inspired more by the black power movement than by 
traditional Islam. Stokely Carmichael, the black power advocate of the 1960s in 
the United States, was born in Trinidad. Prominent Muslims among the region's 
political leaders include President Noor Hassanali of Trinidad and Prime 
Minister Hamilton Green of Guyana. The first Muslims came to the region to work 
in the sugar cane fields in the 1700s. Now, domed mosques can be found on a 
dozen Caribbean islands.

STEINBRENNER LOSES YANKEE ROLE IN GAMBLING INQUIRY

George Steinbrenner was forced to resign as general partner of the New York 
Yankees on Monday by baseball Commissioner Fay T. Vincent, all but ending his 
turbulent reign as the team's owner. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement came following a daylong meeting in Vincent's office and was the 
result of a four-month investigation by the commissioner into Steinbrenner's 
dealing with self-described gambler Howard Spira. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Steinbrenner will have no further involvement in the management of the New 
York Yankees or in the day-to-day operations of that club," Vincent said in 
announcing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner must resign as general partner by Aug. 20, when someone will be 
appointed to take his place, subject to the approval of Vincent and the other 
major league teams. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, however, will be allowed to consult on major business decisions 
involving the Yankees. But he must ask Vincent's permission to attend games. 
</P>
<P>
"For all purposes, Mr. Steinbrenner agrees that he is to be treated as if he 
had been placed on the permanent ineligible list," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner also agreed not to contest the decision in court. 
</P>
<P>
The news spread quickly through Yankee Stadium, where New York played Detroit. 
Fans greeted the announcement with a 90-second standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not comment on the decision," Steinbrenner said. "I'm very happy it was 
resolved. I'm very satisfied with the resolution, and that's all I'm going to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, one of the most controversial figures in baseball history, is the 
only owner to be severely penalized twice for major offenses. He was suspended 
in 1974 by then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn for making illegal campaign 
contributions to Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Vincent disciplined Steinbrenner for violating Rule 21, otherwise 
knows as the "best interests of baseball" clause. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation centered on Steinbrenner's $40,000 payment to Spira, a 
31-year-old New Yorker who describes himself as a former gambler and a former 
employee of the David M. Winfield Foundation. The commissioner wanted to know 
why Steinbrenner gave the money to Spira. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner testified before Vincent on July 5 and July 6 and gave various 
reasons for the payment. Among them were that he was afraid Spira would attack 
his family, that he gave Spira the money "out of the goodness of my heart" and 
that he wanted to protect two former Yankees employees from embarrassing 
revelations. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this sad episode is now over," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second straight summer baseball penalized one of its more famous 
characters. Last August, Pete Rose was banned for life for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's 18-year tenure as principal owner of the Yankees has been 
peppered with disciplinary action by the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
He has been fined several times, most recently on July 5 when Vincent docked 
him $25,000 for tampering with Winfield in the days after his May 11 trade to 
the California Angels. The Yankees also were ordered to pay the Angels 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 27, 1974, Kuhn suspended Steinbrenner for two years following his 
guilty plea to felony violations of the federal election law. Steinbrenner was 
reinstated on March 1, 1976, for good behavior, but former Yankees employees 
have said recently that Steinbrenner violated terms of that suspension.

STEINBRENNER ORDERED TO YIELD CONTROL OF YANKEES 
</P>

Baseball Commissioner Fay T. Vincent stripped George Steinbrenner of his 
control of the New York Yankees on Monday for associating with gambler Howard 
Spira. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner will remain as part-owner of the Yankees, but was forced to resign 
as principal partner. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Steinbrenner will have no further involvement in the management of the New 
York Yankees or in the day-to-day operations of that club," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
Fans at Yankee Stadium for a game against the Detroit Tigers greeted the 
announcement with a 90-second standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement followed a daylong meeting in Vincent's office and was the result 
of a four-month investigation by the commissioner's office into Steinbrenner's 
dealing with self-described gambler Howard Spira. 
</P>
<P>
"This sad episode is now over," Vincent said, adding that he had made his 
decision in order to "preserve and protect this noble game." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm greatly disappointed in Steinbrenner's actions," Vincent said. "He ignored 
the responsibilities of the commissioner of baseball . . . he paid the famous 
$40,000 to a gambler without coming to me under circumstances which he said 
amounted to extortion." 
</P>
<P>
Spira claimed he was given the money for information that Steinbrenner could 
use against former Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield (now with the Angels), with 
whom Steinbrenner had a long-running feud. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said Steinbrenner's relationship with Spira "was not in the best 
interest of baseball" and that Steinbrenner will no longer be able to exercise 
day-to-day control of a team he has run since 1973 but would remain as a 
limited partner with shares in the Yankees organization. 
</P>
<P>
He said Steinbrenner would have to reduce his interest in the team to below 50% 
and added that Steinbrenner agreed to the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner must resign as general partner by Aug. 20, when someone will be 
appointed to take his place, subject to the approval of Vincent and the other 
major league teams. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said the new general partner could be Steinbrenner's son, Hank, but the 
commissioner cautioned that anyone in that position found to be consulting with 
Steinbrenner on baseball matters would be subject to expulsion from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"For all purposes, Mr. Steinbrenner agrees that he is to be treated as if he 
had been placed on the permanent ineligible list," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner will, however, be allowed to consult on major business decisions 
involving the Yankees, but he must ask Vincent's permission to attend games. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner agreed not to contest in court the decision or the commissioner's 
power to make it. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not comment on the decision," Steinbrenner said. "I'm very happy it was 
resolved. I'm very satisfied with the resolution, and that's all I'm going to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner is the only owner to be severely penalized twice for major

Steinbrenner's testimony implicated Manager Lou Piniella of the Cincinnati 
Reds, a former manager of the Yankees, but the commissioner's office cleared 
Piniella of any wrongdoing.

2ND CAMARENA FIGURE GUILTY OF KIDNAPING; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: BUT THE DEFENDANT, LIKE ONE BEFORE HIM, IS ACQUITTED OF MURDER IN THE 
SLAYING OF A U.S. DRUG AGENT. 
</P>

<P>
A Los Angeles federal court jury Monday convicted a former Mexican state 
policeman on kidnaping charges in the 1985 slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique 
Camarena, but acquitted him of murder. 
</P>
<P>
The six-man, six-woman panel found Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, 31, guilty of 
three of the six counts against him. He was convicted of committing a violent 
crime in aid of racketeering, aiding and abetting the 1985 kidnaping of 
Camarena, and being an accessory after the fact in the agent's kidnaping and 
murder by helping a Mexican drug lord escape from that country two days after 
the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
Bernabe could be sentenced to life in prison on each of the first two 
convictions and up to 10 years in prison on the third. 
</P>
<P>
The jury acquitted Bernabe of three charges: the murder of Camarena, conspiracy 
to kidnap the agent, and aiding and abetting the kidnaping and murder of 
Camarena's pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar. 
</P>
<P>
The verdicts were announced on the 11th day of deliberations, and followed the 
jury's first verdicts, issued Thursday, in which the panel convicted Honduran 
drug kingpin Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, 45, of conspiring to kidnap, torture 
and murder Camarena and on two other charges. But, like Bernabe, Matta was 
acquitted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
After reading the verdicts against Bernabe on Monday, U.S. District Judge 
Edward Rafeedie, at the request of defense lawyers, orally polled the jurors, 
and all confirmed that they had voted unanimously on each count. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie then instructed the panel to resume deliberations on the fate of the 
two remaining defendants, Ruben Zuno Arce and Javier Vasquez Velasco. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena was abducted off a Guadalajara street on Feb. 7, 1985, by members of a 
drug cartel and some of their corrupt Mexican law enforcement allies. His body 
and that of his pilot were found on a ranch outside Guadalajara a month later. 
</P>
<P>
Bernabe was first arrested, with about 30 other people, in April, 1985, in 
Puerto Vallarta by Mexican authorities investigating the Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent's murder. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bernabe was released after he and his boss, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, 
a major Mexican drug kingpin, convinced Mexican authorities that Bernabe was 
merely a servant of Fonseca and had no involvement in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Bernabe had served as one of Fonseca's bodyguards. Last year, Fonseca 
was convicted in Mexico of involvement in the Camarena murder and received a 
long prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
After his release, Bernabe worked in the private security guard business until 
he was arrested by DEA agents in Los Angeles a year ago, after he was lured to 
the city by a former Mexican law enforcement official turned DEA informant, 
Federico Castel del Oro, who was Bernabe's employer. The purported reason for 
the trip had been to obtain equipment for Castel del Oro's security company. 
</P>
<P>
While in Los Angeles, Bernabe admitted on secretly made videotapes and 
audiotapes that he had been present at the Guadalajara house where Camarena was 
tortured and murdered. He also boasted to undercover DEA agents, posing as drug 
dealers, that he helped drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero escape from Mexico 
through the Guadalajara Airport on Feb. 9, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes were played for the jury last month. In one video, Bernabe expressed 
his admiration for Fonseca and Caro, who also was convicted in Mexico last year 
of involvement in Camarena's murder and sentenced to a long prison term after 
his arrest April 4, 1985, in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Bernabe was particularly animated in one tape as he described how he and 
several other heavily armed men held off Mexican police and DEA agents at 
Guadalajara Airport and helped Caro escape. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the trial, DEA agent Salvador Leyva testified that Bernabe had 
pointed an AK-47 rifle at him during the airport incident. Leyva said he had 
"dreamt" about Bernabe for some time afterward and, as he identified him in 
court, said he would never forget the defendant's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Leyva graphically described the airport showdown, noting that he was armed only 
with a .38-caliber pistol, while Caro's men carried assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Leyva expressed his disgust at seeing Armando Pavon Reyes, the 
chief Mexican law enforcement official in charge of the Camarena investigation, 
put his arm around Caro at the airport after conferring on the telephone with 
one of his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Pavon, a first commander with Mexico's Federal Judicial Police, told his men to 
lower their guns and to allow the drug lord to depart. Caro boarded a private 
jet with a woman and his bodyguards, and as it taxied away, the drug lord 
leaned out the door, defiantly held up a machine gun and ridiculed the Mexican 
police and DEA agents by "toasting" them with a glass of champagne and 
shouting: 
</P>
<P>
"Next time, bring better weapons, my children!" 
</P>
<P>
Pavon was later fired and convicted and sentenced to prison for taking a 
$270,000 bribe from Caro for his help in the escape. 
</P>
<P>
Bernabe was the only defendant in the Camarena murder trial who testified. He 
denied having been at the house where Camarena was tortured, or having been at 
the airport when Caro escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers Mary Kelly and Michael Meza attempted to persuade the jury that 
their client had fabricated a story about his involvement in the kidnaping and 
Caro's escape in an attempt to persuade a DEA agent, posing as a drug dealer, 
that he had valuable information in the case. The lawyers said he hoped to 
garner $25,000 for himself and Castel del Oro in return. 
</P>
<P>
The defense also maintained that Bernabe made some of the statements after 
being plied with several beers by undercover DEA agents who met with the 
defendant at a West Covina restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
There also was heated debate during the trial over precisely what Bernabe had 
said during some of the taped conversations, because, at certain points, people 
were talking at the same time. Many hours were spent reviewing a point on one 
of the tapes where it was unclear whether Bernabe had said he was inside the 
house where Camarena was tortured, or merely outside the house waiting for 
Fonseca to emerge from a meeting with Caro. 
</P>
<P>
An enhanced version of the tape indicated that Bernabe had said he was not 
inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdicts were read Monday and the jury had left the courtroom, 
Rafeedie ordered lawyers in the case not to comment until all the verdicts are 
in. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Matta's lawyers had criticized the jury's verdicts, saying that it 
was inconsistent to acquit their client of murder and convict him of the other 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the remaining defendants, Zuno or Vasquez, is specifically accused 
of Camarena's murder. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, in the first Los Angeles trial in the Camarena case, Raul Lopez 
Alvarez and Rene Verdugo Urquidez were convicted of Camarena's murder and 
sentenced to life in prison by Rafeedie.

DRUGS: NATIONAL GUARDSMEN ALSO TAKE PART IN THE START OF A CAMPAIGN BY THE 
ADMINISTRATION TO USE ACTIVE-DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL IN THE DRUG WAR.

The nation's war on drugs took on the look of a real war here Monday when 
regular U.S. Army troops, on orders from the White House, joined federal raids 
of suspected marijuana gardens in the King Range National Conservation Area 
about 175 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The raids, which also included about 100 National Guard troops ferried in Army 
Blackhawk helicopters and more than 30 armed federal agents, signal the start 
of an unusual and controversial campaign by the Bush Administration to use 
active-duty military personnel in non-emergency domestic law-enforcement 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Renner, sheriff of Humboldt County where the raids took place, expressed 
displeasure with the way the federal troops "stormed in," and area residents 
protested the "invasion" of nearly 200 armed soldiers in camouflage fatigues 
and face paint as frightening for their children and horses. 
</P>
<P>
Involvement by the military in domestic law enforcement is common in Third 
World nations, but runs counter to longstanding tradition in the United States. 
Recently, however, frustrated federal officials have talked often of using the 
military as a source of cheap manpower and abundant technology in the war on 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The Army troops used Monday, and scheduled to continue their raids until Aug. 
10, were from the 7th Infantry Division (Light), a Ft. Ord-based unit that saw 
action in the Panama invasion last December. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials declined to say exactly what they netted in the "Operation 
Green Sweep" raids, but noted that their main target was not individual 
marijuana plants but the water tanks, irrigation systems and other 
infrastructure set up on public lands to facilitate the growing of the illegal 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Hastey, state director of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, said that Army 
pilots and personnel were unarmed, but National Guard troops were allowed to 
carry M-16 automatic rifles. BLM rangers and other law enforcement officers 
carried their usual side arms and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
Despite assurances from Hastey and others that care was being taken to insulate 
local ranchers, sportsmen and artisans from the raids, the use of military 
weapons and low-flying Army aircraft sparked a demonstration by several dozen 
angry, sign-waving residents at the operation base camp. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the crowd told of anxious encounters with soldiers on foot and in the 
air as they scouted for marijuana patches. 
</P>
<P>
Blossom Edwards, 17, said that after seeing a man with a weapon run through the 
woods, she came upon five or six others lying motionless in some leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"They were pointing their guns at me," she said. "Every weapon -- every barrel. 
I said, 'Hey, who are you? What is going on? Stop, you're scaring me,' but they 
wouldn't talk to me, wouldn't say a thing -- and wouldn't take their guns off 
me." 
</P>
<P>
She left unharmed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Undersheriff Tom Heilmann said that although "it's perfectly all right with us" 
if the federal government polices its own land, he wished it would be in a less 
"abrasive" fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Brong, the BLM special-agent-in-charge, said from the raiders' air 
operations headquarters in Arcata that efforts are being made to ease the 
effect on local residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize these helicopters are an inconvenience to local residents," he 
said. "But we believe that these marijuana gardens are as much or a bigger 
threat to both visitors and local residents than helicopter noise." 
</P>
<P>
Heilmann said the county declined an offer to join in the raids, opting to save 
its limited budget for the state-run Campaign Against Marijuana Planting later 
in the summer. That program, now approaching its eighth year of raiding mature 
marijuana crops, also includes the Bureau of Land Mangement but no military 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The Humboldt County crackdown represents the first of what is expected to be a 
series of major raids this summer as the federal government takes aim at a 
domestic marijuana crop whose size has become a major embarrassment for the 
Bush Administration's war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
A new Drug Enforcement Administration report puts the size of the U.S. crop at 
5,500 metric tons last year -- triple the yield just four years earlier. At 
least half the total is believed cultivated on federal lands, where growers 
operate to avoid sanctions that could otherwise lead to confiscation of their 
own property. 
</P>
<P>
According to federal experts, the boom has made marijuana the nation's No. 1 
cash crop, with farm-gate receipts estimated at more than $13 billion a year. 
At street prices, according to DEA expert John P. Sutton, the business is worth 
"$20 billion to $30 billion . . . at minimum." 
</P>
<P>
The boom has inspired charges of hypocrisy from the coca-growing nations of 
Latin America, angry that the United States pressures them to stamp out cocaine 
production while unable to get a grip on its home-grown equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to set a better example, the Bush Administration has doubled its 
anti-marijuana budget this year to $18 million, with another doubling proposed 
for next year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first one, and there may be more coming," said Cy Jamison, 
director of the Bureau of Land Management. "These lands are for the general 
public (and not) just the drug-growing public." 
</P>
<P>
The participation by active-duty soldiers represents the first time these 
military personnel have been deployed in marijuana raids in the continental 
United States. Soldiers in Hawaii earlier this year played a limited role in 
operations on state lands there, and Navy aircraft have been used to survey 
that state's marijuana crop, according to a senior Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
Once the nation's leading producer of marijuana, California has declined in 
importance in the face of the Campaign Against Marijuana Growers, an aggressive 
state government enforcement effort that has shrunk the crop by about 
two-thirds in its seven years. Federal officials believe its output now trails 
behind Hawaii, Kentucky and Tennessee and is about even with Missouri and 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-produced marijuana was estimated last year to account for at least 25% of 
the domestic supply. The official estimate of the American market share 
declined this year to 10% as a result of a major revision of federal figures on 
Mexico's marijuana crop, with a new survey putting its size at nearly 10 times 
previous reports. 
</P>
<P>
But federal officials continue to believe that the high potency of U.S. 
marijuana -- with eight times the kick of what was widely smoked in the 1960s 
-- makes it far and away the favorite of millions of Americans who smoke what 
remains the nation's most widely used illegal drug.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III was forced to cancel several meetings 
here Monday and rest in bed after he suddenly became ill, State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state departed from a conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum to return to his quarters, leaving it to Commerce Secretary 
Robert A. Mosbacher to give a speech that Baker was scheduled to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something serious. He just doesn't feel well, and he's resting today. 
It's nothing to be alarmed about," Tutwiler said. She said Baker had developed 
a fever by the time he woke up Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said that Baker does not plan to alter the itinerary for the remainder 
of his 10-day visit to Asia.

SOUTH CAROLINA STATEHOUSE ROCKED BY INVESTIGATION; 
</P>
<P>
A CLOUD OF SCANDAL GROWS AS FEDERAL AGENTS SUBPOENA THE CAMPAIGN SPENDING 
RECORDS OF ALL OF THE STATE'S LAWMAKERS.

<P>
A cloud similar to the one that enveloped the California Legislature two years 
ago has now settled over Columbia, the South Carolina capital. An FBI sting 
aimed at rooting out possible corruption in the Legislature has rocked state 
lawmakers and undermined reputations, although no charges have been filed yet. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents have subpoenaed all campaign spending records for every one of 
the state's 124 House members and 46 state senators. Also, at least 15 
legislators have been subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
The effect has been dramatic. The announcement of such a widespread probe is 
"devastating" to an entire institution because it often sours public 
perception, said Carl Tubbesing, director of the Washington, D.C., office of 
the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
The taint could easily spread if the FBI continues to target state 
legislatures. Because so many of the nation's 7,600 state lawmakers are 
"citizen legislators" with other jobs, they inherently face suspicion of 
conflicts of interest, even though their performances have "improved enormously 
in the last 15 years," Tubbesing said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Sting 
</P>
<P>
Ron Cobb, a gregarious, cigar-smoking former state legislator who is now a 
lobbyist in Columbia, apparently cooperated with FBI agents in the probe. Cobb 
allegedly doled out thousands of dollars in a hotel room to legislators who 
accepted the cash in exchange for promising to support long-stymied legislation 
to allow betting on dog and horse racing. The federal Hobbs Act makes it 
illegal for officials to accept money in exchange for official acts. 
</P>
<P>
One of Cobb's clients reportedly was Alpha Group, supposedly an Atlanta-based 
firm that was trying to promote parimutuel betting in South Carolina. However, 
directory assistance here provided no such listing. 
</P>
<P>
The encounters were reportedly videotaped. Cobb hasn't been talking since news 
of the sting broke, but reports speculate that he joined the operation for 
money or insulation from legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities are not saying much either. In a joint statement on July 
20, U.S. Atty. E. Bart Daniel and Frederick B. Verinder, special agent in 
charge of the FBI in South Carolina, said they were investigating "allegations 
of illegal conduct involving certain members of the South Carolina 
Legislature," adding that the investigation "will be thorough, complete and 
brought to a conclusion as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact 
</P>
<P>
Around Columbia, the question immediately resounded: Did they or didn't they? 
</P>
<P>
For some, the question cut deeply. "Those people are just like family," said 
Ada Loranger, manager of the Capitol restaurant, near the Statehouse. "And 
family don't talk about family. Every legislator has been in here at one time 
or another." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, several legislators denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ennis Fant, a Democrat from Greenville who accepted a $1,300 contribution, 
said he and Cobb "talked very briefly. He said he wanted this legislation. I 
told him I was already in favor of it. He said: 'Here's a contribution.' I said 
thank you." Fant said he reported the contribution in his records, which were 
subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who did not accept contributions say they are affected. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us in the General Assembly are tainted by the whole thing, even those 
of us who are not involved," said Rep. William McCain, an Orangeburg 
Republican. He said that at church, baseball games and other events, "people 
come up to me and say how disappointed they are." 
</P>
<P>
The state was ripe for a sting. State laws allow unlimited cash contributions, 
and lobbyists do not have to itemize the contributions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outlook 
</P>
<P>
Campaign reform laws likely will result. Already, amid comparisons with other 
states, there are calls for change. In North Carolina, for example, a candidate 
can accept no more than $100 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federal probe is likely to be a long one. Influence-selling can 
be difficult to prove, so investigators must be extra careful in putting 
together their cases. In California, for example, a legislative sting surfaced 
in August, 1988, but the first indictment did not come until the following May. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the result, when the South Carolina investigation is done, McCain's 
philosophy likely will have spread. "I don't take cash contributions from 
lobbyists," he said. "That's not smart. It doesn't only have to be right, it 
has to look right."

CONGRESSIONAL CHEERLEADERS RALLY AROUND THEIR CAUSES

<P>
Illustrating how business is sometimes done in the corridors of federal power, 
the "Frost Belt caucus" in Congress has been calling for California and Texas 
to pay a bigger share of the cleanup costs for the savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through its informal organization, the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, 
caucus members have been backing an extra deposit insurance premium in states 
with a high proportion of insolvent state-chartered thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"The leading culprit in this Texas-sized problem is none other than the Lone 
Star State itself -- a veritable bailout blackhole," said Rep. Olympia J. Snowe 
(R-Me.), a Frost Belt advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from the coalition's traditional adversary, the "Sun Belt caucus," was 
instant. Rep. Steve Bartlett (R-Tex.) growled: "This is merely Texas-bashing 
for home consumption." 
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND: Informal groups, such as the Frost Belt and Sun Belt caucuses, work 
to influence legislation as it moves through the elaborate network of 
congressional committees and subcomittees. 
</P>
<P>
The Northeast-Midwest coalition, a group of 36 senators and 100 House members 
from states stretching from Maine to Iowa, was formed in the 1970s when the 
energy crisis forced many firms to shift factories to low-cost locations in the 
South and Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Its latest move in the savings and loan scandal is typical of its efforts to 
get more federal dollars for the Frost Belt region or make other areas pay a 
greater share of government's costs. 
</P>
<P>
But there are many similar groups, promoting such special interests from 
protecting the lowly mushroom to promoting Pentagon reform. Some groups, 
however, do not take a position on legislation but exist to keep their members 
informed on issues or just provide a forum for political talk. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Democratic Forum, known as the "boll weevils" because of its 
Southern and rural orientation, was formed by Rep. Charles W. Stenholm (D-Tex.) 
in the early 1980s. Stenholm, who is still the group's coordinator, calls its 
36 members together for breakfast at 9 a.m. every Thursday in the Speaker's 
dining room for off-the-record discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Some informal groups remain relatively quiet until a crisis galvanizes them 
into action to fight for an amendment or put pressure on the executive branch 
on behalf of their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
The Congressional Mushroom Caucus, for example, is lying low at the moment. It 
was founded by Rep. Richard T. Schulze (R-Pa.), who represents a district where 
26% of all U.S. mushrooms are grown. When an influx of mushrooms from China and 
Taiwan threatened the markets of growers in the '70s, Schulze quickly enlisted 
60 lawmakers from 25 mushroom-growing states to defend the U.S product. 
</P>
<P>
There is a caucus working on behalf of each of the following industries: 
aviation, alcohol fuel, coal, copper, footwear, insurance, soybeans, steel, 
textiles, tourism, trucking and wine. Issues such as human rights, 
anti-terrorism, fire services, adoption, crime, the arts, rural health, space 
and population also have their own congressional cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
The Military Reform Caucus, now led by Sen. William V. Roth (R-Del.) and Rep. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), was formed in 1981 by former Sen. Gary Hart 
(D-Colo.) to challenge conventional Pentagon thinking and promote an 
alternative, less costly defense program. Known as "cheap hawks," the 140 
members of the caucus have succeeded in passing a series of measures designed 
to improve Pentagon procurement and to make sure that weapons work as they were 
designed. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The seeds of major legislation may be planted in a casual caucus 
session and then later flower in one of the House or Senate committees with 
jurisdiction over the issue. The caucuses will remain influential because they 
provide a rare opportunity for informal contact between Democrats and 
Republicans who share the same interests and want to make an imprint on the 
legislative process despite their junior standing in the rigid congressional 
hierarchy.

The Soviet Union and Albania agreed Monday to end their nearly three-decade 
estrangement by restoring diplomatic relations that were severed over the 
Kremlin's ideological quarrel with China. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to re-establish ties and reopen embassies was reached during 
talks held in Sofia, Bulgaria, on June 29-30 and in Tirana, Albania's capital, 
on Monday, said the official Soviet Tass news agency and the Albanian Telegraph 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The decision marked the latest step by Albania, Europe's last stronghold of 
hard-line communism, to emerge from its postwar isolation.

For nearly 25 years, the Soviet Union has been making overtures to Albania to 
normalize relations that Albania broke off in 1961 during Moscow's split with 
China, then a Tirana ally. 
</P>
<P>
Kremlin leaders, however, could not overcome the deep distrust of the Soviets 
instilled by Communist Albania's founding father, Enver Hoxha, who died in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Tass dispatch, which was also was read on Soviet television and radio, said 
the Soviet Union and Albania were guided in their decision "by a mutual desire 
to develop the relations of friendship and cooperation on the basis of 
sovereignty, equality and non-interference in each other's internal affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Tirana pledged to expand contacts in the political, economic, 
scientific, technical and cultural areas, it added. 
</P>
<P>
Albania left the Warsaw Pact in 1968 after the Soviet-led invasion of 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The Balkan nation broke with China in 1978 and established a course fiercely 
independent of both military blocs. It claimed to be the only nation practicing 
true communism and criticized the Soviet Union, China and other Communist 
countries as the "gravediggers of the revolution." 
</P>
<P>
It prided itself on being self-reliant, and its population of 3.2 million has 
been virtually cut off from the outside world since 1944. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Albanian citizens demanding change forced their way into 
foreign embassies in Tirana and were allowed to leave the country.

EX-POLISH REGIME REPORTEDLY FOILED PLOT TO KILL POPE

Poland's former Communist government foiled a 1983 plot to kill Pope John Paul 
II but did not disclose the scheme to the public, Polish television reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The report quoted law Prof. Krystyna Daszkiewicz as saying the plot was 
disclosed by former Communist Gen. Zenon Platek at the 1985 trial of four 
former secret agents who were convicted of killing pro-Solidarity priest Jerzy 
Popieluszko. 
</P>
<P>
Daszkiewicz is about to publish a book about a cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
Daszkiewicz told Polish TV that Platek testified in court that the Interior 
Ministry had discovered "operational signals" about a plot to assassinate the 
Pope when he traveled to Poland in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some persons with arms and explosives arrested," Daszkiewicz quoted 
Platek as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Daszkiewicz suggested one or more of the four convicted agents may have been 
involved in the plot and someone in the Interior Ministry in 1983 may also have 
been linked to the attempt because forged passes allowing the bearer to come 
close to the pontiff were found in the safe of Adam Pietruszka, one of four 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
Daszkiewicz said the court in the northern city of Torun did it not pursue the 
revelation. She believed this may have been on orders of Communist authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Observers speculated that the plotters could have come from one of the former 
East Bloc countries whose intelligence services were connected with the Soviet 
secret police.

FOREIGN MINISTRY DENIES PAYING REPORTERS FOR PRO-ISRAELI STORIES

Two journalists alleged Monday that some radio reporters working free lance for 
foreign stations accepted money or favors from the Foreign Ministry to do 
pro-Israel stories packaged as independent news items. 
</P>
<P>
The two, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the free-lancers worked out 
of a Jerusalem recording studio that has close ties with the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry denied the allegations Monday but said it suspended all ties with 
the studio lest "some aspects of the current arrangements . . . be misconstrued 
as involving a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported Monday that ministry officials secretly channeled 
money to the studio to pay the reporters' salaries. It also said that Israeli 
diplomats abroad helped the free-lance reporters recruit radio clients. 
</P>
<P>
One Jerusalem-based radio reporter told the Associated Press that the ministry 
paid the studio fee of $75 per hour for some free-lance reporters who otherwise 
would have to pay the fee. 
</P>
<P>
In return, "sometimes they (ministry officials) ask the reporters to publish 
certain information," the reporter said. 
</P>
<P>
Another broadcast journalist said some colleagues working for foreign stations 
accepted money from the ministry in exchange for stories favorable to Israel 
packaged as independent news reports. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it has worked with the studio for years, commissioning 
programs that are distributed by Israeli embassies abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry claimed that it decided to suspend ties with the studio on July 18 
-- 10 days before it was first asked by the New York Times about the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the ministry was concerned that some 
journalists who worked for the studio also free-lanced for clients abroad. 
</P>
<P>
But Avi Yaffe, owner of the studio, said the suspension was a result of the 
media inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
Yaffe said that nearly half his business came from the Foreign Ministry, but he 
denied allegations of a covert link. 
</P>
<P>
He said more than 10 free-lance reporters use his studio to produce programs 
for foreign radio stations, including two major U.S. networks.

MAN BURIED BY QUAKE FOR 14 DAYS SAYS HE GAVE UP, TRIED SUICIDE

<P>
A man rescued Monday 14 days after an earthquake buried him in the basement of 
a luxury hotel said that while trapped in the darkness, he often wished he were 
dead and even tried to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
Pedrito Dy, a cook and part-time fitness instructor, was the third survivor 
since Friday to be pulled from the ruins of the Hyatt Terraces Hotel in the 
resort of Baguio. 
</P>
<P>
Dy, 27, was flown to Manila for treatment. Dr. Raul Morena said Dy's athletic 
build protected him from serious injury in the 7.7 quake that killed more than 
1,600 people on July 16. Doctors said he suffered only from dehydration and low 
blood sugar, which had caused disorientation. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from his hospital bed, Dy said that while trapped he lay on his back 
beneath a cushion, which protected him from the debris that shifted repeatedly 
in aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
He said he survived by drinking urine and rainwater. "I caught water with my 
mouth and scooped urine with the palm of my hand," Dy said. 
</P>
<P>
Dy's voice was barely audible. His eyes were glazed and his conversation 
rambled from recollection to recollection without concern for the subject or 
sequence. 
</P>
<P>
Dy said he had finished his shift as a cook at the 350-room hotel and headed 
for the basement gymnasium to lead about a dozen employees in an afternoon 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly the building shook and the force of the temblor hurled him against an 
exercise mat hanging on a wall. The wall collapsed but the mat shielded him 
from serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
While trapped, Dy said he was aware of the passage of time because a clock that 
had hung on the gym wall continued to strike every noon and midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"On the 13th day I told myself I wish I were dead," he said. "I attempted to 
kill myself two times. I banged my head on the wall. . . . I prayed constantly 
to the Virgin Mary and gave my life up to the Lord. Then I wasn't scared 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Dy heard noises. It was the tapping of Filipino miners tunneling 
through the debris. He called out for help. Two hours later he was pulled free.

An opposition newspaper accused authorities of making concessions to drug

cocaine cartel could be part of "a secret deal" with the government. La Prensa 
said that last week's truce announcement came only one day after President 
Virgilio Barco Vargas lifted emergency military control of three Medellin

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered Monday that the number of generals and 
admirals assigned to his staff be cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney directed that 13 of the 27 spots on his personal staff that are saved 
for Army, Air Force, Marine generals and Navy admirals be eliminated, filled 
with civilians, or given to lower ranking military officers, a Pentagon 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The effect isn't necessarily immediate, since the changes will be made when the 
officers in the present positions finish their tours of duty or move on to 
their next assignments, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The change is in line with the Defense Department's moves to pare the nation's 
armed forces in response to "world changes and tighter budgets," the statement 
said. The affected job positions include the adviser for NATO affairs, the 
deputy assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, the assistant 
inspector general, and the assistant to the assistant to the secretary of 
defense for atomic energy.

President Bush thanked the nation's governors for a bipartisan "constructive 
relationship" on education Monday, even as Democrats stepped up their protest 
against the Administration's latest tax proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Bush addressed the governors at their National Governors' Assn. annual summer 
conference, speaking by telephone from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He pledged continued support for the education reform goals he and the 
governors agreed on last year, and endorsed their revised plans for a national 
oversight panel that will grade the states and federal government on progress 
in meeting the goals. Democrats had insisted on the changes to deny Republicans 
control of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is essential there be some definitive way of measuring progress 
toward these education goals during the '90s, and this decision . . . makes 
good sense," Bush said. "I want to thank everyone there for the constructive 
relationship that we've developed."

OIL SPILL FROM TEXAS BARGE COLLISION WASHES UP ON GALVESTON BAY ISLAND

Oil from a 120,000-gallon spill soiled an island in environmentally sensitive 
Galveston Bay Monday, despite efforts to contain and clean up crude leaking 
from two barges that collided with a tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials who flew over the spill estimated its size Monday at 
120,000 gallons, more than double their earlier estimate of 50,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three areas of oil that have moved (from the collision site)," said 
Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Schaefer. 
</P>
<P>
One area extended about four miles eastward from the spill site with ribbons of 
oil sheen and heavy patches, he said. A second heavy patch about an acre in 
size was concentrated along Redfish Island, and the third patch stretched 
southwest of the accident site about a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Skimmer boats were in place at all three sites to collect the oil. A vacuum 
barge also was at Redfish Island, roughly in the center of Galveston Bay, where 
oil already had stained beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard also was trying to determine the source of oil that washed up 
on Stewart Beach, one of Galveston's main tourist beaches, on the Gulf of 
Mexico side of Galveston Island. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil from this spill is not reaching any other beaches at this time. 
However, our mystery spill has reached Stewart's Beach," Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
All of the oil was pumped from one of two disabled barges Monday and workers 
were siphoning crude from a second partially submerged barge. Booms surrounded 
the sunken barge in an effort to contain some of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Booms also were set up to keep the oil from reaching Salt and Dickinson bayous.

WOMEN HAD ROEMER'S EAR ON ABORTION VETO; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: THE LOUISIANA GOVERNOR CONSULTED FAMILY MEMBERS AND CABINET 
OFFICIALS. LISTENING TO THEM SPARKED A PERSONAL TURNING POINT.

<P>
As he was pondering whether to sign the nation's strictest abortion bill last 
week, Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer listened to his estranged wife, Patti, his 
23-year-old daughter, Caroline, and the three women members of his Cabinet. 
All, Roemer said Monday, independently arrived at the same conclusion: "Veto." 
</P>
<P>
Then Roemer did just that. 
</P>
<P>
As Roemer explains it, their collective judgment served as a catalyst in 
transforming his once firm and unqualified opposition to abortion into what 
appears to be a much broader and more permissive stance, a position which 
Roemer now feels urgently obliged to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I am destroying my breakfast this morning," he told a Times 
reporter as his eggs got cold on his plate in a hotel coffee shop in Mobile, 
where the Louisiana Democrat was attending the national governors conference. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference last Friday, Roemer explained his veto mostly through 
objections to some of the bill's provisions. The bill would have banned 
abortion except in the case of threat to the mother's health or in cases of 
aggravated rape or incest. Doctors who performed an illegal abortion could have 
been sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, Roemer emphasized that facing the veto, and listening to the 
women around him, was a personal turning point. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest issue of this decade," Roemer said. "And it doesn't relate 
just to abortion -- it relates to the values of women. 
</P>
<P>
"If I talk to 100 women, what 80 of them say is 'I don't want an abortion, I'm 
not looking for an abortion. I'm looking for a place in the decision process. 
It's my body and my family and it ought to be my choi" 
</P>
<P>
When Roemer entered Congress 10 years ago he consistently voted against federal 
funding for abortion and supported a constitutional ban on abortion. "I 
believed then that abortion on demand, or abortion as a substitute for birth 
control, was not in best interests of the unborn or of families. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel that way. However, 10 years ago I would allow no exceptions to 
that rule. And looking back I was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"To be concerned with the unborn, who have no voice, is good," Roemer said. 
"But (to be concerned) at the expense of those who are alive, mothers whose 
lives are threatened, who have been illegally violated, seems to me not 
compassionate, not fair, not decent, not pro-life." 
</P>
<P>
In the process of reaching his decision to veto, Roemer also appears to have 
arrived at a changed approach to political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
When he first took office in 1988 the 46-year-old Harvard-educated former 
congressman quickly became known for his expansive ambitions to reform the 
errant ways of his state's government and his headstrong commitment to getting 
things done his own way. 
</P>
<P>
"I am talking now as a politician who has prided himself on his ability to 
speak," Roemer said. "I can turn people around when I speak." 
</P>
<P>
But from his trials as governor, Roemer discovered that speaking is not enough. 
"What I have added now is the ability to listen," he said. "Let me put it the 
other way, my greatest power might be in listening, not in speaking." 
</P>
<P>
The listening on abortion started within his own family. "My daughter talked to 
me a lot," Roemer said. "She is pro-choice and anti-abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"She explained to me, 'I'm not after an abortion. I'm after my value to make a 
decision,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both my daughter and wife reflect what a majority of women think. They are 
opposed to abortion on demand, but they would like to have the value to make a 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
In battling with the Louisiana Legislature on the issue, Roemer insisted that 
any abortion legislation must at the least contain exceptions for rape and 
incest. He decided to veto the bill after concluding the exception for rape was 
not strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he had vetoed an even tougher version of the bill, which would have 
allowed an abortion only in the event the mother's life was at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Now Roemer expects the Legislature, which adjourned after passing the law, to 
reconvene Aug. 18 to consider overriding his veto. But Roemer says he hopes for 
a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for all his traditional Southern adherence to the concept of states 
rights, Roemer has begun to wonder whether that principle is suitable to the 
abortion controversy. "This may be one of those issues that are best served not 
locality by locality but on a national basis," he said.

COUNTIES BRACE FOR THE WORST WITH SIGNING OF BUDGET

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, putting an end to the longest budget deadlock in state 
history, today is expected to sign a $54-billion-plus state budget after 
vetoing at least $419 million in spending approved by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The signing of the budget is the final action necessary to complete work on the 
spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
Once the budget is signed, the state will have the authority to meet a payroll 
to nearly 200,000 state employees due today, and meet other legal obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian will be affixing his signature to a budget that has been delayed 
longer than any other in the state's 140-year history. The previous record was 
set in 1983, when Deukmejian, after a prolonged battle with the Legislature, 
did not sign the budget until July 21. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Southern California county leaders nervously awaited Deukmejian's 
final editing of the budget. Until then, they will not know how much money is 
available for the array of public services that counties provide, affecting 
hospitals, health clinics, trial courts, probation and jail supervision and 
treatment of mental illness, among others. 
</P>
<P>
They don't like what they see so far. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any way we can avoid cuts in health care," said Richard B. Dixon, 
chief administrative officer for Los Angeles County. Similar sentiments were 
voiced Monday by officials in Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"It is worse than our worst-case scenario," said Orange County Health Care 
Agency Director Tom Uram. "I thought it would be bad, but it is worse." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara County, still reeling from the financial burdens of last month's 
disastrous wildfire, is contemplating reduced library hours and higher taxes, 
said James Laponis, a county assistant administrative officer.

BRADLEY SENDS IN NEW PLAY FOR COLISEUM; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: MAYOR'S DEPUTY SAYS A CHANGE IN MANAGERS MAY BE NEEDED TO MAKE THE 
FOOTBALL TEAM A BETTER OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In an indication that Mayor Tom Bradley is dissatisfied with the progress of 
talks to keep the Raiders in Los Angeles, his deputy, Mark Fabiani, suggested 
Monday that it might be necessary to find a new private manager for the 
Coliseum to make the football team a better offer. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the current Coliseum private management firm, Spectacor 
Management Group, said Fabiani's statement comes at an inopportune time, just 
days after Spectacor made Raider owner Al Davis a new offer to which he has not 
yet responded. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Spectacor official Anthony Tavaras said, Bradley does not have the 
authority to retain a new private manager. Such a decision to pay off 
Spectacor's Coliseum contract and obtain a new manager would have to be made by 
the Coliseum Commission, to which the city appoints three of nine members. 
</P>
<P>
Against the background of a new $127-million Oakland offer to the Raiders with 
a 45-day acceptance deadline, Fabiani said Bradley is concerned that there may 
not be much time to pursue the Raider negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Fabiani said, the mayor has asked him and his new appointee to the 
Coliseum Commission, labor leader William R. Robertson, "to look at all 
available options." 
</P>
<P>
"If it becomes clear at some point that Spectacor can't or won't perform under 
its agreement with the Coliseum Commission, the mayor has an obligation to 
explore every other possibility to keep professional football in Los Angeles," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, Bradley does not regard an infusion of public money as a 
possibility. The options under discussion are a new private manager, or a new 
partner for Spectacor, replacing MCA Inc., which bowed out. A new partner might 
enable Spectacor to make a better offer. 
</P>
<P>
Tavaras, however, expressed concern that Fabiani's statements might undercut 
Spectacor's latest offer to Davis. He characterized the offer as generous. 
</P>
<P>
What is reported to be blocking a Los Angeles agreement with Davis is his 
demand for an unconditional $10-million cash advance, guaranteeing that the 
Coliseum will be renovated. Spectacor does not want to make the payment all at 
once and it wants other conditions met. 
</P>
<P>
If environmental or historic preservation considerations were to prevent 
renovations, then the Raiders could keep the money, just as they kept a 
$10-million advance from Irwindale when that city was unable to fulfill its 
promise to build a stadium there. 
</P>
<P>
Some Oakland officials have suggested that if Davis were to accept the latest 
Oakland offer, the Raiders might buy out the rest of their Los Angeles Coliseum 
contract, which has two years remaining, and move back to Oakland in time for 
this fall's games.

GILBERT M. JORDAN, 50; HIS FIRM PLACES TENANTS IN OFFICE BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gilbert M. Jordan, founder of a unique firm that places tenants into office 
buildings, died Monday at his Los Angeles home of cancer. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
He founded Jordan Associates in 1985 after serving as senior vice president of 
the management division of Cushman Realty Corp. There he coordinated the 
mammoth Manhattan Consolidation Project in New York City, which had a lease 
value of more than $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
With his own company he specialized in owner-tenant representation services for 
such clients as Carnation Co., Transamerica Insurance, Walt Disney, Pillsbury 
and many others. In addition to assisting in negotiations, he oversaw the 
selection of interior designers, contractors and others. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Boston, Jordan moved to California in the 1960s. Earlier he had been a 
principal of an interior architectural and design firm. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his mother, Lorraine M. Tornabene of Boston, and a sister, 
Michele Wygant of Santa Barbara. A memorial fund has been established in his 
name at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles.

WOMAN GRANTED LAST WISH FOR SON'S VISA DIES 
</P>

Sonia Siguenza, the terminally ill woman whose final wish was granted when the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service issued an emergency visa to allow her 
son to visit her from El Salvador, died Monday at Western Medical Center here. 
</P>
<P>
Siguenza's husband, Israel Siguenza, was with his wife Sunday night, as he has 
been almost every night in the 2 1/2 months she has been in the intensive care 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her she had beautiful eyes, and she opened her eyes for me, and I 
kissed her and said goodby," he said. "It was time. She was already tired." 
</P>
<P>
Sonia Siguenza, 25, a native of El Salvador, contracted an infectious blood 
disease almost two years ago. When she learned she would probably not get 
better, she asked for a final visit with her 9-year-old son, Walter, whom the 
couple had sent back to El Salvador to live with grandparents when she grew too 
weak to care for him. 
</P>
<P>
Fulfilling the wish proved difficult for Israel Siguenza, as he was turned down 
by one official after another. Although Siguenza, a car salesman in Costa Mesa, 
is a legal resident, his son is not because he had lived in the United States 
only a short time. 
</P>
<P>
Sonia Siguenza's physician, Dr. Michael Fitzgibbons, wrote U.S. Sen. Pete 
Wilson (R-Calif.), who personally appealed to INS Commissioner Gene McNary in 
Washington. McNary arranged a "humanitarian visa" in June, allowing the boy to 
stay for three years. 
</P>
<P>
"He cries sometimes, and he is very sad that she has died," Siguenza said of 
his son. "I wish I could have done more for her, but I did what I could," he 
added, his voice breaking. "We got her son here. I think she passed away 
happy."

PLANE WRECKS YIELD REMAINS OF 2 PILOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wreckage of two small private planes -- one missing for more than three 
years -- and the remains of their pilots have been found in mountains near the 
Owens Valley, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A hiker near Hart Lake, 37 miles southeast of Bishop, discovered the skeletal 
remains of a pilot whose single-engine Cessna 172 disappeared in June, 1987, 
said Inyo County sheriff's deputies. The name of the pilot was withheld pending 
notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Another Cessna 172 and its pilot, Jerry Dell Teel, 48, of San Bernardino, were 
found by hikers at nearly 12,000 feet in Sequoia National Park, deputies said. 
Teel's plane disappeared during a heavy snowstorm in January, and a weeklong 
search failed to locate the craft.

12 FIREFIGHTERS PLUCKED FROM SEA AS BOAT HITS REEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen Anaheim firefighters were pulled from the ocean off Santa Catalina 
Island on Monday afternoon when a 67-foot schooner ran aground on a hidden reef 
during a race from Long Beach, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The Diosa del Mar was sailing in an annual firefighters' race with scores of 
other craft when it struck the reef at 2:45 p.m. and partially sank on Ship 
Rock about a mile offshore, forcing those aboard into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard cutter Point Evans, which was in the area on routine patrol, 
arrived within minutes of the accident, took the passengers aboard and put them 
ashore at Isthmus Cove on the island, a spokesman said.

<P>
No one was injured.

A respiratory infection caused a two-day delay in the retrial of U.S. District 
Judge Robert Aguilar on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
The trial judge, U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle, granted the delay after 
ordering an examination of Aguilar, 59, by a doctor other than his own. Aguilar 
was charged in 1989 with eight counts of using his judicial office to influence 
other judges in handling cases involving Aguilar's friends. The first trial 
ended May 19 with acquittal on one count of conspiracy and jurors deadlocked on 
the seven other counts. The second trial has been trimmed to four counts.

WARDING OFF INDUSTRY AILMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: WHILE OTHER PROVIDERS ARE FALTERING OR GOING UNDER, UNIHEALTH HAS 
BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND BY MAKING CAREFUL USE OF RESOURCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The health care industry is a sick business, but Burbank-based UniHealth 
America thinks it has found a way to treat the disease: It just keeps growing. 
</P>
<P>
UniHealth, a nonprofit corporation formed by the merger of two hospital groups 
in 1988, keeps adding hospitals and programs but is still a distant second in 
size to the Los Angeles area's biggest health care provider, Kaiser Permanente. 
</P>
<P>
But at a time when many health care providers are suffering, Paul Teslow, 
UniHealth's president and chief executive, says UniHealth wields enough 
marketing muscle and economies of scale to give it a good shot at surviving 
today's turbulent market. 
</P>
<P>
The current squeeze in health care is due largely to tighter reimbursement 
policies the federal government adopted in 1984, which have been imitated by 
large insurance companies. At the same time, hospitals and other medical 
facilities are faced with rapidly rising costs because of increasingly 
expensive labor and technology and the high cost of treating growing numbers of 
uninsured patients. But they are finding it tougher to pass on those costs to 
customers such as big employers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's already been tremendous pressure from employers to do more about 
health care costs," said Lois Evans, head of accounting firm Deloitte &amp; 
Touche's West Coast health care consulting practice. "That pressure is only 
going to get much more severe." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many hospitals have been mothballing wings, merging and closing 
their money-losing trauma care centers. Some health maintenance organizations 
-- which developed largely as a response to rising costs by offering services 
for prenegotiated prices -- have also had troubles. For instance, Los 
Angeles-based Maxicare filed for bankruptcy protection last year. 
</P>
<P>
UniHealth is a nonprofit corporation, but it must still take in more money than 
it spends to stay solvent and to pay for new programs and facilities. Unlike a 
for-profit corporation, a nonprofit is required to reinvest all its earnings 
into the organization. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine months that ended May 31, UniHealth earned a "profit" of $34.4 
million, compared with a $14.8-million profit in the fiscal year that ended 
Sept. 30. Revenues are expected to hit $2.1 billion this year, in contrast with 
$1.7 billion in fiscal year 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Given the troubled state of health care, "just being in the black is pretty 
good right now," Evans said. How does UniHealth do it? 
</P>
<P>
One plus it has is being a nonprofit organization. Last year, for instance, the 
California Health Facilities Financing Authority, a state agency, sold $200 
million in tax-exempt bonds for UniHealth, and Teslow plans to use much of that 
money on a big expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, UniHealth plans to spend $250 million to build new 
outpatient facilities and create a state-of-the-art management information 
system that will allow every part of its network to call up patient information 
at the push of a button. This information system would also allow UniHealth to 
gather data on treatment outcomes for a wide range of diagnoses, which it can 
then show to potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage for UniHealth is its size. UniHealth owns 12 hospitals, 
including Northridge Hospital, Santa Monica Hospital and Long Beach Community 
Hospital. It owns LifePlus, a psychiatric and drug dependency program, the 
ElderMed America seniors program, home health care services, dialysis centers 
and a mail-order pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
UniHealth also benefits from its ownership of CareAmerica, an HMO that has 
grown profitable through a strategy of targeting small employers, and its 58% 
interest in PacifiCare, one of the nation's most highly regarded HMOs. 
PacifiCare reported its net income increased 71% to $10.9 million in 1989 on 
revenue of $650.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Being big also helps UniHealth strike better deals with suppliers. When it 
purchased a sophisticated diagnostic imaging machine for one hospital recently, 
it negotiated a $540,000 discount on the $3-million list price because the 
vendor knew UniHealth would place orders for other hospitals. It has also been 
able to cut printing costs by 40% by standardizing forms used at its 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
UniHealth also attracts doctors -- and their patients with them -- because it 
offers the stability of a large, financially sound organization, and advanced 
technology. Long Beach Community Hospital, for example, recently opened a 
$1.5-million state-of-the-art cardiac catheterization laboratory, a drawing 
card for heart specialists. 
</P>
<P>
The size and scope of UniHealth also allows it to offer its customers the 
ability to negotiate a wide range of services under one contract. That was a 
major selling point for Southern California Edison, a large self-insured 
employer. "When you're not sitting down and negotiating with several different 
hospitals, it does streamline things," said Donovan Ayers, an Edison contract 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Teslow sees UniHealth becoming sort of a one-stop-shopping network for 
health care. It is even creating a line of "brand name" services, such as its 
New Arrivals maternity care program. UniHealth hopes expectant mothers will 
choose the program because it combines a wide array of birthing options with 
highly personalized care at its six maternity centers. 
</P>
<P>
That coordinated marketing approach to health care will give UniHealth an 
advantage over smaller systems and independent facilities, Teslow said. 
"Virtually no other networks, aside from Kaiser, operate on the kind of 
business plan that we're working on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Health care experts give high marks to UniHealth's strategy. "I think they've 
positioned themselves extremely well," said Roger F. Greaves, chairman of 
Woodland Hills-based Health Net, a large HMO that contracts with UniHealth 
hospitals. An executive at rival Kaiser, Robert Essink, said UniHealth provides 
good competition. "They're smart people and they know what they're doing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
UniHealth was formed in June, 1988, when Woodland Hills-based HealthWest 
Foundation and LHS Corp. of Los Angeles, two large hospital groups, decided to 
pool their resources. The renamed UniHealth moved its headquarters to Burbank 
and named Teslow, formerly HealthWest's president, to his current post. Samuel 
Tibbetts, former president of LHS, is now chairman of UniHealth. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very tradition-bound coming into the merger," Teslow said. Even as 
HealthWest and LHS added new hospitals and services, he said, each unit 
continued to operate independently. But he envisioned a more systematized 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year was kind of a watershed period where we were able to change the 
practice of how we delivered health care," Teslow said. 
</P>
<P>
It was also a period of cost-cutting. In the first year after the merger, 
UniHealth laid off 1,000 workers, consolidated services, became self-insured, 
refinanced its debt and sold some operations for a combined savings of $11 
million. UniHealth now has 12,000 employees and 5,000 doctors affiliated with 
its hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of UniHealth's hospitals posted operating losses in the nine months 
that ended May 31. Its biggest money loser is California Medical Center in 
downtown Los Angeles, which serves a largely indigent population and loses 
about $5 million a year. But Teslow says there are no plans to close or sell 
the hospital, because, as a nonprofit organization, "our commitment to 
community service is strong." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UniHealth is hoping some strong independent hospitals and outpatient 
services will also opt to pool their resources with a large network. San 
Gabriel Valley Medical Center, for example, recently merged with UniHealth, and 
Teslow says several others will likely come on board during the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Teslow said if all goes right, he envisions building a similar one-stop medical 
complex around UniHealth's lone operation outside California, Meadowlands 
Hospital Medical Center in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
But first, Teslow wants to make UniHealth a household word in Southern 
California. That will happen, he said, when "people and employers become 
familiar with the network of services and they'll see that UniHealth is the 
glue that holds these comprehensive services together."

OFFICE VACANCIES UP IN VENTURA, DOWN IN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The office vacancy rate for the San Fernando Valley dropped slightly to 14% in 
the second quarter of 1990, while it jumped to 23% in Ventura County, according 
to a survey by the real estate firm Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite uncertainty in the real estate industry . . . the San Fernando Valley 
does not seem to be experiencing the severe difficulty that other parts of the 
nation are," said Howe S. Foster of Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy rate "has been fairly flat," Foster said, pointing out that in the 
first quarter of the year, the Valley's rate was 15%, up from 14% in the last 
quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But in Ventura County, a large amount of new office space came on the market 
and pushed up the vacancy rate from 20% in the first quarter. In the second 
quarter, more office space was available because Chevron Corp. decided not to 
move into a new 111,478-square-foot office building in Oxnard, as previously 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley as a whole performed well, according to one key measure, net 
absorption, which is the increase in occupied office space during the quarter. 
Net absorption in the Valley was 468,000 square feet, compared to 148,000 
square feet in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley's office space market was strongest in the East Valley, where the 
vacancy rate was only 7%. 
</P>
<P>
The East Valley, which covers Burbank, North Hollywood, Studio City and 
Universal City and has 5.3 million square feet of office space in 55 buildings, 
had a net absorption of 210,616 square feet during the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Foster attributed the strong office rental market in the East Valley to the 
many movie, television and recording companies in the area. "The entertainment 
industry is just booming and the capital of the entertainment industry is the 
east San Fernando Valley," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the central San Fernando Valley, which includes Encino, Sherman Oaks, Van 
Nuys and Northridge, the vacancy rate was 14%. Meanwhile, the net absorption in 
the central Valley, which has 65 office buildings with 6.6 million square feet 
of space, was 18,466 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The news was more mixed in the West Valley, where the vacancy rate was 21%. 
Despite the high vacancy rate, the area showed a large increase in occupied 
office space with a net absorption of 253,699 square feet in the second 
quarter, up from a mere 3,700 square feet in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, the vacancy rate in the Valley soared as high as 21% as 
numerous office buildings were completed. But Foster said that because of 
stricter zoning controls, "they simply are not going to be able to build 
projects as big or as fast as they did in the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, the net absorption was 26,665 square feet in the second 
quarter, down from 111,059. 
</P>
<P>
Within Ventura County, the Conejo Valley, which includes Thousand Oaks, Newbury 
Park and Westlake Village, had a net absorption of 58,193 square feet and a 
vacancy rate of 20%. 
</P>
<P>
In the Coastal Plain area, which encompasses Oxnard and Ventura, the vacancy 
rate was 23%, while the amount of occupied office space declined by 47,550 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
In the Simi Valley area -- which accounts for only 5% of the office space in 
Ventura County -- the office vacancy rate was 53%.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: POLLUTION RESEARCH &amp; CONTROL MAY BE SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pollution Research &amp; Control Corp., a Glendale company that makes 
air-quality monitoring devices, said it is considering offers to buy the 
company. The company declined to name any of the potential buyers, but said it 
had "entered into preliminary discussions" with them. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution Research also announced that it would report that sales of its 
primary product, devices for measuring ambient air pollution, would show a 
"significant decline" in the fourth quarter that ended June 30. Pollution 
Research attributed the drop in sales to lower than expected demand for the 
devices in the United States and Korea. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pollution Research said that as a cost-cutting measure, it will 
sell 75% of its Air Instruments &amp; Measurement subsidiary to its management 
in exchange for royalties from the unit's sales. Albert E. Gosselin Jr., chief 
executive officer of Pollution Research, said AIM's management in turn would 
probably sell the unit.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HEMACARE CORP. REPORTS LOSS IN SECOND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HemaCare Corp., a Sherman Oaks company that provides blood-related services, 
reported that it lost $295,576 in the second quarter that ended June 30, 
compared to a profit of $27,804 a year earlier. The company's revenues 
increased 31% in the second quarter to $1.87 million from $1.42 million a year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
HemaCare attributed the loss in part to the costs of beginning clinical trials 
of a proposed AIDS treatment, called passive hyper-immune therapy. The therapy 
involves treating AIDS patients with infusions of sterilized blood plasma from 
donors who are healthy but are infected with the virus that causes AIDS. The 
company also said that its 4-month-old HemaCare Clinical Laboratories division 
lost money. 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of 1990, HemaCare lost $232,934, compared to a profit 
of $206,802 last year. HemaCare's six month revenues jumped 33% to $3.61 
million from $2.71 million a year earlier.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: TEKELEC DOUBLES ITS 2ND-QUARTER EARNINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
Tekelec, a Calabasas producer of communications testing equipment, said its 
second-quarter earnings more than doubled from a year earlier on an 18% 
increase in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter that ended June 30, Tekelec's net income rose to $1.19 million 
from $563,000, while its revenue rose to $9.74 million from $8.25 million. The 
gains partly reflected strong international orders, which rose 38% in the 
quarter from a year earlier, Tekelec said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1990, Tekelec's profit rose to $2.38 million from $1.81

CHUNG TRADES SERIES FOR CHANCE AT MOTHERHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: CBS NEWSWOMAN POSTPONES HER NEW MONDAY NIGHT PROGRAM BUT WILL STILL 
DO SIX NETWORK 'SPECIALS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the more unusual developments in network television, newswoman Connie 
Chung declared Monday that she is postponing her new CBS magazine series while 
she and her husband, TV journalist Maury Povich, try to have a child. 
</P>
<P>
The program, "Face to Face with Connie Chung" -- a retooling from her Saturday 
night show of last season -- was scheduled to begin a regular run in September 
at 10 p.m. on Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
But CBS News announced on Monday that she will only do six as-yet-unscheduled 
"specials" through December, and will continue anchoring the Sunday night 
edition of "CBS Evening News." 
</P>
<P>
CBS Entertainment then announced that it will fill the Monday night slot with a 
new Sharon Gless series, "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," in which the actress 
will play an upscale Beverly Hills corporate attorney turned public defender 
for downscale clients. The executive producer is Barney Rosenzweig, who also 
ran "Cagney &amp; Lacey," in which Gless co-starred. 
</P>
<P>
The new series will debut Sept. 17 during the network's premiere week. 
</P>
<P>
A CBS News publicist said that the weekly "Face to Face With Connie Chung" 
series will be started "as soon as possible." But there was no estimate of when 
that might be. 
</P>
<P>
"Maury and I have reached an important point in our lives," Chung said in a 
prepared statement released by the network. "We want very much to have a child. 
Unfortunately, time is running out for me when it comes to childbearing. I will 
be 44 next month." 
</P>
<P>
Povich anchors the daily syndicated magazine series "A Current Affair," 
although he is leaving when his contract is up next summer to develop a talk 
show for Paramount Domestic Television. 
</P>
<P>
Chung said that after consulting her doctors last week, she felt that she 
needed "to take a very aggressive approach to having a baby." 
</P>
<P>
She asked the network "to lighten my workload" and said that the network was 
accepting her decision "wholeheartedly." 
</P>
<P>
"This was an extremely difficult decision for obvious reasons," she went on. "I 
have always kept my private life just that. It's difficult to publicly reveal 
such an important private moment. But I want to be honest with everyone. I look 
forward to returning to a weekly prime-time series as soon as I can." 
</P>
<P>
The network also released statements from CBS executives saying that they 
supported Chung's decision and would welcome her back when she is "ready." 
</P>
<P>
A CBS News spokeswoman in New York, Catherine Upin, said that there has been no 
discussion at this point about adjusting Chung's contract. 
</P>
<P>
During a press conference July 14 in Los Angeles at the annual summer interview 
tours for TV writers, Chung was asked if she wanted to co-anchor the nightly 
newscasts with Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my plate full," she said emphatically. "I mean, I'm doing just fine 
with . . . I have a lot of work to do. I'm very old" -- she laughed -- "and 
it's hard to keep up with all this traveling around." 
</P>
<P>
Upin related Chung's schedule that week: Monday interviews in New York, Tuesday 
interviews in Washington, Wednesday and Thursday interviews in a small 
California town, Friday interviews in L.A., Saturday the press conference and 
the last flight to New York for the Sunday night newscast, then Monday back to 
L.A. for two stories.

THE PERSONAL CRUSADE OF JUDAS PRIEST'S ROB HALFORD; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: LEAD SINGER OF THE BRITISH HEAVY-METAL BAND IS SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY 
TODAY ABOUT SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES. HE HAS BECOME A FIXTURE IN THE COURTROOM AS HE 
DEFENDS HIS MUSIC. 
</P>

<P>
As lead singer of veteran British heavy-metal band Judas Priest, Rob Halford is 
used to being photographed and signing autographs. But that's usually backstage 
at one of the group's head-banging concerts. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two weeks, Halford, 38, has been approached by fans in a place he 
never expected to be: the steps of the Washoe County Courthouse, where his band 
is being blamed in the deaths of two local youths. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation is like Disneyland or something," said the soft-spoken rocker, 
who is scheduled to testify today. "It's so hard for me to comprehend that the 
prosecution actually believes Judas Priest would ever attempt to hurt the 
people who buy our records. Why would we want to do that?" 
</P>
<P>
Halford's band is being sued by the families of two Sparks, Nev., young men who 
shot themselves on Dec. 23, 1985. The parents of Raymond Belknap, 18, and James 
Vance, 20, blame their sons' deaths on auditory subliminal messages they allege 
are embedded in the band's 1978 album "Stained Class." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the parents are seeking unspecified money damages to compensate 
for the deaths, medical bills and child support. In addition, they want 
punitive damages from CBS Records, which produced and distributed the album. 
Both CBS and the band deny the existence of subliminal messages on any Judas 
Priest album. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a conservative gray suit and white shirt buttoned to the collar, 
Halford shook hands and posed for a series of snapshots with a polite crowd of 
heavy-metal fans after Friday's court session. Nothing but the chrome-studded 
black leather boots and belt suggested the rebellious image that Judas Priest 
projects on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people didn't think we'd show up except to testify, but we feel this 
is a very serious issue," the singer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to defend the name of Judas Priest, but also because somebody has 
to take a stand against these . . . attorneys who prey upon the grief and pain 
of families for publicity. We have to stop them from attacking and using art to 
fill their pockets with cash." 
</P>
<P>
Halford and three other members of the quintet -- bassist Ian Hill and 
guitarists K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, are staying in a house outside Reno. 
They rescheduled their upcoming tour and delayed the release of their new CBS 
album to attend the trial, which is expected to run through mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
Onstage, Judas Priest plays the role of a loud leather-clad rock band whose 
performances include heavy doses of fireworks and feedback. 
</P>
<P>
But offstage, Halford, who jots down notes and observes the courtroom 
proceedings intently, insists that he and his band mates lead quite ordinary 
lives. Two are married with children. Three are golf fanatics. Halford is a 
tennis buff. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I consider myself to be a Christian man," Halford said. "I don't 
drink, smoke or take drugs. I don't plant sinister subliminal messages on any 
of my songs. Never have. Never will." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the band, however, have denounced Halford's music and stage show for 
promoting violent, suicidal and satanic themes. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Robert S. Demski, the medical director of a San Antonio, Tex., 
hospital for troubled adolescents, testified in court that he banned the 
group's music from his facility because he believed it induced violent behavior 
in his patients. Also, Darlyne Pettinicchio, a Fullerton probation officer, 
testified that the group's music glorifies Satan, causing youths to become 
self-destructive. 
</P>
<P>
Peter A. Michas, vice president of the National Information Network, a 
Redlands-based organization that prepares training manuals to educate police 
departments across the United States as to the negative effects of heavy-metal 
music, says Halford is using his daily presence at the trial to fleece the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course he's going to claim his music is not satanic. What else would you 
expect him to say?" Michas asked in a phone interview. "If you ask me, putting 
a Judas Priest album on the turntable is like putting a loaded gun in a kid's 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
Halford scoffs at such accusations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's preposterous. These people act like we drink a gallon of blood, hang from 
crucifixes upside down and do incantations before we go on stage," Halford 
said. "What we do is show business. Our fans expect us to dress in the costumes 
we wear. I mean, it's not as if we could go out there looking like (country 
singer) Waylon Jennings, now could we?" 
</P>
<P>
Halford says the band is very concerned about the trial's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"If the judge does decide against, that means Judas Priest might literally end 
up being charged with criminal manslaughter," Halford said. "At the risk of 
sounding melodramatic, I believe such a ruling could open up a hornet's nest in 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists, producers and record companies could be forced to sign affidavits 
swearing that no subliminal messages have been inserted into every piece of 
work they did. Radio and TV stations that played the music would also come 
under scrutiny, having to run non-subliminal disclaimers." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courthouse, a small group of fans pledged to maintain a vigil 
throughout the trial to show support for Judas Priest. Reno resident Scott 
Michaud, 19, called the charges against Halford's band "a bunch of false 
accusations." 
</P>
<P>
William Ellenberger, 18, says he intends to picket the trial for its duration. 
"Heavy-metal music doesn't kill people," Ellenberger said. "How can the parents 
blame Judas Priest when it was their own kids' fault?" 
</P>
<P>
Even Vivian Lynch, one of the attorneys attempting to prosecute Judas Priest, 
waited in line for an autograph in court. Lynch has blamed alleged subliminal 
messages in the band's music for pushing "the boys over the edge into 
eternity." 
</P>
<P>
During a recess Friday, however, she told The Times: 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing against the Judas Priest band. They were very nice to me when I 
took their depositions. They gave me autographed pictures for my sons."

SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES AT HEART OF CASE

How do you prove something exists if it cannot be seen or heard? 
</P>
<P>
That's the challenge facing attorneys Timothy Post, Ken McKenna and Vivian 
Lynch. They represent the families of two Sparks youths, Raymond Belknap, 18, 
and James Vance, 20, who shot themselves on Dec. 23, 1985, after an afternoon 
of drinking beer, smoking pot and listening to the music of Judas Priest. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap died instantly. Vance survived the suicide attempt but died three years 
later, allegedly due to related complications. The parents of both young men 
hold the British heavy-metal band responsible for the deaths of their sons and 
have filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Judas Priest and its record 
company, CBS Records. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented case in Washoe District Court centers around the alleged 
existence of subliminal messages purported to be implanted on the band's album, 
"Stained Class." Subliminal messages, experts say, are stimuli that function 
below the threshold of conscious perception. 
</P>
<P>
"Our job is not easy," Post said. "It's like chasing phantoms. Sometimes the 
fact that you can't find it may be an indication that it's right in front of 
your face. It's like we're the ghostbusters or something." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Post and the other attorneys representing the plaintiffs hired 
William Nickloff Jr., a Sacramento sound engineer and private investigator, to 
scour the "Stained Class" album for subliminal clues. Nickloff allegedly 
uncovered a subliminal chant which said the words "do it" implanted on a cut 
titled "Better By You, Better Than Me." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Nickloff appeared at the trial as an expert witness for parents. 
Utilizing a home computer music software package and a portable stereo, he 
played digitized samples of specific phrases from the album forward and 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
He testified that he believed the band took extensive precautions to implant 
the alleged subliminal "do it" commands at several key points in the song, 
splashing the phrase in phonetic segments across 11 of the 24 tracks on the 
master recording, so as to escape detection. In a random survey by a Reno 
newspaper reporter, only two of 12 courtroom observers said they heard the "do 
it" chant. Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead sat poker-faced throughout the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony J. Pellicano, a Los Angeles private investigator and audio tape analyst 
who is scheduled to testify as an expert witness for Judas Priest and CBS on 
Wednesday, insists that there is no subliminal content or backward sounds 
anywhere on the recording. 
</P>
<P>
"These allegations are like something straight out a 'Twilight Zone' episode," 
said Pellicano, seated before a wall of computers, oscilloscopes and spectrum 
analyzers in his Hollywood laboratory. "I will prove in court that there are 
absolutely no subliminal messages on the album." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, Pellicano said that he has spent more than 200 hours 
analyzing the original 24-track recording of "Better By You, Better By Me." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't dispute that there appears to be a a two-beat rhythmic sound present," 
Pellicano said. "But it was not put there intentionally and it certainly does 
not say 'do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Pellicano, the alleged subliminal "do it" chant is actually the 
result of a breathy sound caused by the inhalation and exhalation of the lead 
vocalist in combination with a wispy electric guitar strum. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Gehman Evans, an expert witness who staged a second computer 
demonstration in court Monday on behalf of the parents, said she too can 
testify to the presence of the subliminal "do it." 
</P>
<P>
"This album is a time bomb waiting to go off," Evans, a University of Nevada 
lecturer who holds masters degrees in physics and computer science, told The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I have found enough subliminal references to suicide in different songs on the 
'Stained Class' album to know that this is not some kind of isolated incident. 
I don't pretend to know why, but I do believe it was done deliberately." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the forward "do it" subliminal phrase, Evans alleged that the 
album contains numerous backward sayings such as "commit suicide" and "try 
suicide." Evans said that the only way a listener can consciously hear these 
phrases is to physically spin the record backwards on a turntable. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the parents claim that such backward sayings can be unscrambled 
by the subconscious mind even when a record is played in the normal direction. 
In that regard, the plaintiffs maintain that the alleged backward sayings could 
have influenced the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Pellicano disputed the argument. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have any idea of the number of permutations it would take to come up 
with words that would say one thing in reverse and still correlate to the 
forward content of the lyric and also operate within the natural rhyme scheme 
of the song?" Pellicano asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If you let your imagination run wild, you can infuse just about any sound or 
image with a variety of subjective interpretations. But in science, we don't 
talk about imagination -- we talk about facts." CHUCK PHILIPS

"Presumed Innocent," Warner Bros.' courtroom drama with Harrison Ford and 
Bonnie Bedelia, enjoyed opening weekend ticket sales of $11.6 million, which 
just edged out Paramount Pictures' romantic fantasy, "Ghost," for first place. 
With third weekend ticket sales of $11 million -- only a 12% drop over the 
previous week -- "Ghost" continues to hover as the summer sleeper, with grosses 
in excess of $51 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Problem Child," a comedy Universal Pictures chose not to screen early for 
critics, had ticket sales of $10 million, which put it in third place over the 
weekend. Starring John Ritter and Amy Yasbeck as a yuppie couple who adopt a 
nightmarish 7-year-old, the film's release was heralded by one of the most 
talked-about trailers of the summer in which the youngster is shown wreaking 
havoc on everyone -- including the family cat -- to the musical backdrop of 
George Thorogood's "Bad to the Bone." 
</P>
<P>
Though it was ranked fourth, 20th Century Fox's "Die Hard 2" -- like the spate 
of other heavy-artillery titles -- has begun to plummet. Ticket sales of $5.9 
million represented a drop of more than 40% from the previous week . 
</P>
<P>
* Tri-Star Pictures' "The Freshman" -- which did startling numbers during its 
first weekend of limited release -- widened to more than 1,000 screens, where 
it earned $4.2 million. The quirky comedy, which teams Marlon Brando and 
Matthew Broderick, had a per-screen average of $4,060 -- a modest figure that 
nonetheless tops the $2,813 per-screen average of the much-hyped "Die Hard 2."

<TEXT>

U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and his Soviet counterpart, Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, are said to have the long civil war in 
Afghanistan at the top of the agenda for their planned meeting Wednesday and 
Thursday in this Siberian city. 
</P>
<P>
The two superpowers are reportedly nearing a possible deal that could end the 
conflict, which poisoned bilateral relations during much of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The officials are expected to discuss other regional issues and ongoing 
negotiations over strategic arms and conventional forces in Europe as well. The 
goal: to set the stage for agreements by the fall. 
</P>
<P>
From Irkutsk, Baker goes to Ulan Bator, where talks are to include a plan to 
send Peace Corps volunteers to Mongolia.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There have been so many that their feet have actually worn down 
thousands-of-years-old pyramids in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Their sheer physical weight has triggered cave-ins on the fells of England's 
breath-taking Lake District. 
</P>
<P>
Their millions of tons of human waste have choked the once-pristine beaches of 
Mexico's Acapulco Bay, Thailand's Pattaya and Malaysia's Penang. 
</P>
<P>
Their hotels have shot up so high and so fast that they've blotted out the very 
Spanish coastline they were meant to overlook, caused ancient thermal springs 
in Turkey to run dry and siphoned off the drinking water from drought-thirsty 
Indian villagers. 
</P>
<P>
Their garbage has coated Mt. Everest. Their spilled American cola has eaten 
into the stone floor of Notre Dame Cathedral. Their sweat and breath have 
covered the 2,000-year-old cave paintings of Limoges with mold and white 
calcite. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, they remain perhaps the most sought-after consumers in all the world. 
</P>
<P>
They are the international tourists, the world travelers who help make the 
planet just a bit smaller and their lives just a bit fuller by spending their 
holidays beyond their own borders and shores. 
</P>
<P>
Each year now, they are counted in the tens of millions. And taken together 
they are the clients of what has been dubbed the largest single industry on 
Earth -- a $1-trillion economy built solely on the pursuit of fun, fantasy and 
foreign adventure. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two decades of well-documented explosion in the international 
tourism market, entire nations have planned their future economies around these 
international consumers. For many, it is already their single largest source of 
foreign exchange. And for most it has become an income so vital that their 
economies simply can no longer survive without it. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is so important it is often overseen by Cabinet-level ministers. 
Governments spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year priming the tourism 
pump with subsidized hotels, tax incentives and public relations blitzes. 
Mexico, for example, is spending $10 million this year to hire a New York 
advertising agency and singer Linda Ronstadt to promote itself to American 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, seeking to cash in on the South American tourism vacuum left by the 
drug wars and insurgencies of nearby Colombia and Peru, has launched an 
ambitious plan to sell off more than a dozen state-owned hotels and use the 
expected $1 billion in earnings to help finance construction of dozens more 
private-sector resorts through generous tax breaks and interest concessions. In 
announcing the plan, Venezuela's minister of tourism, Armando Duran, said that 
each new hotel room generates 1.5 jobs directly and 10 indirectly -- a tempting 
equation for so many Third World nations mired in crushing poverty and 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the zeal of even the most remote nations to attract tourist dollars, 
pounds, marks and francs, they have have steadily depleted the number of 
untouched corners remaining in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts predict that the international tourism explosion will continue at 
a growth rate nearing 10% per year, and analysts throughout the world are 
increasingly taking a more serious look at the environmental bust that the 
tourism boom hath wrought. 
</P>
<P>
The number of potential travelers is clearly still on the increase. But many 
underdeveloped nations across the globe that once saw the international tourist 
as their savior are reassessing their projects and projections and finding 
that, in their haste to open their borders to the outside world, they've 
invited the destruction of the very beauty and culture they're trying to 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The tour agencies that have profited mightily by supplying those nations with 
their meandering millions are coming to similar conclusions, actually steering 
clients away from holiday destinations that the agencies themselves first put 
on the world tourism map. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many analysts say that the world is poised today at the cutting 
edge of what may well be a peaceful revolution in world holiday travel, a 
movement toward "gentle tourism." 
</P>
<P>
Today, in the words of one travel agency owner in France, Daniel Bopp of Terre 
d'Aventures, "you have to leave with an environmental ethic, because if you are 
one of the barbarians leaving behind all your bottles and trash, you are sawing 
off the branch that you are sitting on." 
</P>
<P>
Citing specifically Spain and Greece, which have paved much of their once 
splendid coastlines in concrete and tar, tourism expert Graham Todd of London's 
Economist Magazine Intelligence Unit added: "There's an increasing realization 
in countries like these that they're killing the goose that lays the golden 
egg." 
</P>
<P>
And so, the experts say, the world trend in tourism today and tomorrow 
necessarily will be toward the more adventurous, the more ecological and, as a 
result, the more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
By the dozens, governments throughout the world are beginning to restrict 
tourist numbers. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
* Egypt, which turned Sinai beaches into urban construction zones, damaged Red 
Sea coral reefs through unrestricted diving and lost a chunk of the Sphinx's 
shoulder -- possibly through tourist overuse -- now restricts the number of 
private tombs it will open to the public each year. And its scientists are 
studying such arcane impacts as the effect of human breath on the delicate wall 
paintings of Luxor. 
</P>
<P>
* France closed its famous Lascaux caves near Limoges to all tourists after the 
sweat and breath of the constant stream of visitors covered ancient paintings 
with a veil of white calcite. 
</P>
<P>
* Rwanda is levying hefty fees on every tourist visiting its gorilla country, 
both to finance future environmental projects and to discourage the massive 
influx that helped ruin Kenya's game parks. 
</P>
<P>
* Bhutan, an isolated and reclusive Himalayan kingdom, permits only 2,000 
visitors a year and insists that each spend $200 a day in an effort to avoid 
the cultural and physical pollution that inundated nearby Nepal, which 
similarly is cutting back sharply on the number of permits it issues to Mt. 
Everest climbers. 
</P>
<P>
* China, a once-reclusive and tourist-shy nation but more recently inundated 
with millions of visitors, has now decided to boost prices and severely 
restrict the flow of humanity through Beijing's Forbidden City, where the 10 
million tourists who have come each year since 1985 have worn down ancient 
walls and stone walkways. 
</P>
<P>
* The Philippines decided to stop promoting the city of Pagsanjan, one of its 
top tourist destinations, after a booming "sex tour" business turned it into an 
international center for pedophilia and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"So, naturally, international tourism will become more expensive. It's supply 
and demand," according to analyst Todd. "To help save themselves from their 
past, many of these destinations are intentionally keeping down supply. And if 
demand exceeds that supply, then the prices will rise." 
</P>
<P>
Many countries also are changing their overall development strategies in an 
effort to shift away from the "cheap tourism" that has helped foul their 
mountains, tarnish their treasures and poison their shores. 
</P>
<P>
Spain, which consistently has been one of the world's most popular -- and 
cheapest -- tourist destinations, is now planning top-class resorts that will 
appeal to wealthier tourists and take over from the seedy, overdeveloped towns 
that are now cited worldwide as models of how not to grow. 
</P>
<P>
In Turkey, where a seven-year tourist boom has achieved the government's goal 
of 5 million annual visitors but turned several coastal resorts into concrete 
jungles, tourist operator Omer Ahunbay observed, "Some people woke up and said, 
'We don't want to be just like Spain.' " 
</P>
<P>
Having seen too many olive groves and vineyards turned into hotel parking lots, 
officials in Cyprus declared a moratorium on new hotel construction, at least 
until October. 
</P>
<P>
The pollution of Acapulco Bay, foot-worn archeological sites like the pyramids 
of the Sun and Moon and an ongoing controversy over a tennis and sailing club 
that is threatening an environmentally important estuary all combined to 
convince Mexican authorities to try a new approach. They have accepted an offer 
from the Cousteau Society to develop a computer-designed model of an 
ecologically sound seaside resort north of Puerto Vallarta -- a parallel 
project to the society's beach-resort restoration project in the South of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Amazon Basin is perhaps the best illustration of the new, gentle wave 
of tourism. Last year alone, 35,000 tourists from throughout the world enriched 
the region with millions of dollars on "ecological tours" that include river 
excursions and jungle treks in which guests often sleep in hammocks or rustic 
floating hotels. Brazilian officials hope the Amazon adventures will eventually 
compensate for a 25% drop in tourist arrivals this year largely caused by 
pollution and soaring crime rates in its top tourist destination, Rio de 
Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
The gentle revolution is reaching to Asia, as well, where ill-planned, 
helter-skelter tourist development has created some of the world's worst 
holiday hell-holes. 
</P>
<P>
In the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal, which has been inundated with foreign 
tourists in the three decades since it opened itself to the outside world, 
hundreds of tourists are spending thousands of their tourist dollars this 
summer on Mt. Everest -- not to climb it but to clean it. It's part of an 
organized world campaign to collect the tons of garbage that thousands of 
hikers and trekkers have left behind in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Far to the south in the Muslim nation of Indonesia, where environmentalists 
have sharply criticized the overdevelopment of the island resort of Bali and 
are fighting plans to displace fishermen with tourist development on another 
island, Emil Salim, the minister for population and the environment, said the 
government is increasingly sensitive to ecological concerns in tourist 
development. "In Bali, for example," he said, "we only allow hotels in areas 
not suitable for agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby Malaysia, which declared 1990 its "year of tourism," also is attempting 
to learn from the errors of its past. It is building a "second Penang" on an 
island 70 miles north of the original showcase coastal resort -- now so 
polluted by the sewage from scores of poorly planned tourist hotels that the 
water is considered a danger zone. 
</P>
<P>
But has Malaysia really learned from the mistakes of its past? The second 
Penang, where marine sports centers, resort hotels and golf courses are now 
being built at a record pace, already has lost a major waterfall that was a 
tourist attraction in itself. Builders putting in the road meant to deliver 
tourists to the site managed to sever the waterfall from its natural water 
supply. And another section of the island is blighted by an abandoned 
unfinished hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"It all boils down to the way in which the responsible authorities handle 
tourism development in each destination," analyst Todd said in assessing how 
some nations are succeeding where others have failed. "A well-managed and 
well-resourced tourism facility can be a great catalyst for development, but 
there's a good deal of corruption and greed and haste in many of these 
countries, and that's where the problem comes in. 
</P>

"What's really been missing over the years in most destinations is the long, 
cool assessment of the destination management. Too many were in too big a rush 
to get into the action. And, in the end of the day, it does become a political 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the world today, there is perhaps no better illustration of tourism 
gone haywire than the Southeast Asian nation of Thailand, which has been thrust 
uncomfortably onto center stage of the international debate about tourism's 
environmental impacts since it became a virtual household word among tourists 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
In several of Thailand's best-known tourist meccas, once idyllic beaches have 
become cesspools of human waste, towns have grown at dizzying rates without 
zoning or environmental planning and the country has earned a worldwide 
reputation as a slave market for beautiful girls who work as prostitutes 
catering to foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
For authorities in Bangkok, who are now beginning to show signs of changing 
their tourism policies, the cost-benefit equation began with 800,000 tourists 
in 1986 and mushroomed to the 4.3 million tourists who pumped more than $1 
billion into the Thai economy last year, making tourism Thailand's biggest 
single source of foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
In the now-ravaged coastal resort of Pattaya, 100 miles south of Bangkok, there 
is the cost side of that equation, illustrated starkly in these figures: 266 
hotels and 11,000 condominium units built with no sewer system and a water 
supply so inadequate that hotel guests frequently must use bottled beer to 
flush their toilets; more than 15,000 resident prostitutes, a growing number of 
whom are now infected with the AIDS virus, and a shoreline so heavily polluted 
that the National Environmental Board recently found fecal-matter readings in 
the water seven times higher than the international safety limit. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tourism has grown too fast, without direction," declared Chaivalit Atisap 
of the Tourism Authority of Thailand in an unusually candid assessment. "Our 
people lack the experience and preparation needed to deal with it cleverly." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the authority has pledged it will in the future devote half of its 
budget to protecting the environment at tourist destinations, and it is seeking 
international assistance to bolster the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to have another two or three provinces seriously ill like 
Pattaya," Mayor Suchai Rouyrin, who is himself a nightclub owner, said during a 
recent conference on the environmental impact of tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't repeat our mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
They are, nonetheless, mistakes that have been repeated again and again by 
nations throughout the world -- by countries like Kenya, which, in its zest to 
attain last year's record figures of 700,000 tourists and $350 million in 
tourism revenues, flooded its game parks with hotels, Land Rovers and humans in 
such large numbers they cut the wild game off from their natural hunting 
grounds. As a result, there have been reports of elephant herds invading banana 
plantations to feed, occasionally trampling people to death in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Said one local tour operator: "Unless the government does something urgently to 
either restrict the number of visitors or close the parks down for part of the 
year, we are going to be left with glorified zoos." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, for every disaster area, there are those few that fought against the 
current of the international tourism rush of the '70s and '80s, those few 
countries that have done it right -- or not at all, countries like Mauritius, 
Bhutan, the Maldives and Malawi. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more than any other motive, though, these cautious few were responding 
less to the fear of physical pollution and more to the xenophobia of cultural 
pollutants: the nude sunbathing that made an entire population of village 
elders flee their seaside resort in Ayia Napa, Cyprus, and build, with tourist 
revenues, an entire new village on a nearby hillside; the scantily clad 
tourists who continue to anger local residents near Aqaba in Jordan; the 
bikinied blondes local officials have blamed for an increase in rape among 
villagers near the South Indian resorts of Kovalam and Goa. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most novel approaches was that of the Maldives, a lush archipelago 
nation of hundreds of pristine, white-sand islands in the Indian Ocean. The 
Maldivians, who are fundamentalist Muslims, auctioned their islands to top tour 
developers, who agreed to meet guests at the airport with speedboats that take 
them directly to their resorts without ever bringing them into the main 
population center of Male. 
</P>
<P>
Africa's Calvinist society of Malawi, which bars male visitors whose hair falls 
below their collar and forbids women to wear trousers in public, also found a 
solution to the dilemma of promoting its extraordinary reef fish without 
exposing its people to sinful displays. European women who land at the capital 
of Lilongwe in slacks are hastily wrapped in long skirts by local officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to increase our tourism, certainly," said Harry Thomson, a 
leading Malawian businessman. "But not at risk of offending our lifestyle. We 
want the 'A' tourists, not the 'B' tourists like backpackers." 
</P>
<P>
Such an approach is the only logical one for analysts like Graham Todd, who 
believes the world of nations as a whole is moving increasingly toward the 
tourism philosophies of such conservative, one-time outsiders as Malawi and the 
Maldives. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, Todd concluded, most governments have realized that it 
is they -- and not the tourists they have encouraged -- who are ultimately to 
blame for disasters of the past and responsible for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong to blame the poor old tourist," Todd said. "Even the way he behaves 
is not entirely his fault. The tourist largely will only do what he is 
permitted to do. The ultimate control is with the nation's management. 
</P>
<P>
"And if you want to control the numbers, one of the best ways is to put the 
price up and restrict the number of visitors. It's inevitable, and it's both a 
positive and a logical trend. After all," Todd added, "the attractions of a 
concrete coast sort of diminish after a time."

Todor Zhivkov, the ailing Bulgarian Communist hard-liner awaiting trial for

Parliament this week to accusations that he brutally repressed opponents and 
ethnic minorities. 
</P>

A parliamentary commission has refused to allow the address to be carried live

<TEXT>
<P>
"Yeah, there's always the scent of coconut around here," Nancy Serwint 
conceded, a slow smile lighting her bronzed face. Suntan lotion -- coconut 
scented or otherwise -- is one of the requisites of an archeological dig, along 
with trowels, whisk brooms and dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Serwint teaches Greek and Roman art at Arizona State University, and for 
the past eight summers she has come here to probe the soil of northwestern 
Cyprus for evidence of a culture that flourished more than 2,500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She receives no pay, leaves a "very understanding" boyfriend behind in Tempe 
and spends two months under a hot Mediterranean sun. "We do it because we love 
it," she explained. With a passion, in Serwint's case. 
</P>
<P>
Bounding over dirt tracks at the wheel of the expedition's Land Rover, the 
professor heads for the Peristeries site, where three years of digging has 
revealed the stone and mud-brick walls of a pagan sanctuary of the 6th Century 
BC. The convincing discovery was a cache of terra cotta figurines, votive 
statues offered in prayer to the gods. 
</P>
<P>
"We've uncovered nearly 5,000 of them," said Serwint, an expert on the little 
figures, molded in remarkable detail, their wide, stylized eyes staring out 
across the centuries. Votive art was obviously big business, and the gods were 
well entreated during what archeologists call the Cypro-Archaic Period. 
</P>
<P>
Across the breadth of this island and on the Middle East mainland beyond, the 
artifacts and architecture of ancient civilizations mix with modern life, a 
heritage exploited and embraced. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt's sphinx, Israel's Masada and Jordan's rose-red ruins of Petra are 
symbols of their cultures; they inspire a silent sense of awe and turn a pretty 
tourist dollar. The past is for sale today, mainland merchants tell visitors, 
and "licensed" dealers in antiquities proffer frail examples of Roman glassware 
and tiny sandstone oil lamps. 
</P>
<P>
History is business in the Middle East, whether long recorded or lurking under 
a few feet of soil. Even here on Cyprus, where the pursuit of archeology has 
been more marked by academic professionalism, dig leaders this summer have been 
brushing up their spiels for the inevitable arrival of tour groups on the 
grounds. It will help pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial aspects, however, are largely lost on most archeologists. Theirs 
is a profession whose rewards come in discovery and understanding. Success 
fills the ego, not the bank account. Their shop is the dig site. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists ask questions. What is this thing, what was its use and who used 
it? With more physical evidence, they start forming answers: This wall circles 
the settlement. These people had enemies, or feared they might. 
</P>
<P>
The professionals describe their work more elegantly. "Archeology is the study 
of the material remains of human thoughts and actions," said Stuart Swiny, who 
has excavated sites in France, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Cyprus, and since 
1980 has been director of the Cyprus American Archaelogical Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Swiny's institute, based in Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, and funded in part by 
the U.S. Information Agency, is a research center and unofficial clearinghouse 
for information on archeological expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
This rocky island, tucked deep in the eastern Mediterranean off the Turkish and 
Syrian coasts, has more archeological sites per square mile than any other 
country, Swiny estimated. Its ancient cities may not have the magic names of 
those burnished by early written records -- neither Babylon nor Ur, Jericho nor 
Troy -- but they are no less a temptation to a professional archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
"There, in Mesopotamia, we know the names of the kings," Swiny explained. "We 
don't know as much about the people here. Cyprus was never a power. It did not 
have a big population. But is was rich in agriculture, rich in copper and it 
had timber." 
</P>
<P>
Through the centuries, those riches drew settlers, traders and armies from the 
Neolithic Period onward, and the coastal areas are covered with evidence of 
their culture. "There's pottery here," an archeologist will shout to his 
colleagues on a field survey of a likely site. The broken bits of ceramic, 
churned up by a farmer's plow, are usually the first sure sign that some work 
of man lies below the soil. 
</P>
<P>
In Cyprus, the government's Department of Antiquities handles requests for digs 
from foreign expeditions, and it receives high praise for its efficiency, 
particularly in comparison to the bureaucratic nightmares encountered elsewhere 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
No archeological find -- pot, figurine or bronze spearhead -- is allowed to 
leave. They are turned over to the government for possible museum display, and 
the archeologist leaves only with his notes, photos and measurements -- the 
material of the reports he will write to fix his footing on the academic 
ladder. It's a publish-or-perish discipline. But it's not dull. 
</P>
<P>
"Now look at this, look at this," bubbled David S. Reese, a Cambridge 
University Ph.D and research associate at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural 
History. Reaching into the wooden shelves of a stuffy storeroom in the southern 
Cypriot village of Episkopi, Reese pulled out a plastic bag containing the 
jawbones of a pygmy hippopotamus. "We've got 125 hippos and two pygmy elephants 
so far," Reese said, meeting a visitor in standard field attire -- shorts, no 
shirt and sandals. 
</P>
<P>
Reese, his wife Catherine, and a UC Riverside graduate, Gwyn Alcock, were 
"tagging and bagging" the bits of bones found over the past eight years at a 
collapsed cave on Akrotiri Peninsula, the most electrifying prehistorical find 
in Cyprus. Carbon dated at 8,200 BC, some of the bones have been burned, and 
bits of flint were found in the same site, suggesting to archeologists that 
early man had killed the hippos, cooked them and eaten them. 
</P>
<P>
If so, several sizzling conclusions can be drawn: that man came to Cyprus 
almost 2,000 years earlier than previously believed and that these first 
Cypriots hunted the hippos and elephants to extinction, a disappearance whose 
cause had previously puzzled scientists. 
</P>
<P>
These are the answers that archeologists dig for. Sometimes they come suddenly, 
like the Akrotiri evidence. Other times it's hard, plodding work. 
</P>
<P>
East of Akrotiri, near the village of Zygi, Brandeis University's Ian and 
Alison Todd, a husband-and-wife archeological team, have been working for more 
than a decade in a coastal valley and have dug both neolithic and Bronze Age 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do a study of an area to see how life has changed from its 
earliest occupation to the present," Todd said. "I talked to the Cypriot 
authorities and they suggested this valley. It's been perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found evidence of about 140 sites and we have excavated four. Every 
500 meters up the valley floor, we have cut a trench to see what's there." His 
expeditions have found a Late Bronze Age town as large as any on Cyprus, and at 
a neolithic site called Tenta, they uncovered the earliest-known wall painting 
on the island, a red human figure with arms outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
Like most expeditions, the Todds' depends on student labor, which explains the 
summer digs. Here in Polis on the north coast, the Princeton-Cyprus Expedition 
under the direction of Prof. William Childs is digging at three sites in the 
city known in ancient times as Marion and later Arsinoe. The stoop labor is 
done by work boys, young locals whom Childs pays about $80 a week out of his 
$100,000 budget for the two-month season. Graduate students and doctoral 
candidates -- "pre-docs" in the parlance -- are assigned as "trench masters," 
overseeing the work boys. Everybody pulls the duty. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here to be the architect's assistant, and here I am in the trench," 
laughed Amy Cassens from the University of Illinois, where she is an art 
history major at the Champaign-Urbana campus. 
</P>
<P>
The students learn quickly under the direction of Childs, Serwint, his 
assistant and other old hands. The dirt is peeled back with small hand picks, 
dustpans and brushes. Alert eyes watch the surface for signs of anything but 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
On a trench overseen by UC Berkeley student Cristina de la Torre, a graduate of 
Marymount High School in Los Angeles, work boys were using dental tools to 
separate dirt from the firmer substance of a mud brick. Even at meals, the 
students said, they had formed the habit of eating a lasagna-like dish layer by 
layer. 
</P>
<P>
While the broad goal is to uncover the layout of a site -- the walls, floors 
and columns -- the thrill comes in a find: a figurine, a pot or some other 
man-made object. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old volunteer from Princeton, N.J., was credited with the discovery 
in Ashkelon, Israel, announced last week, of a figurine believed to be a 
precursor of the biblical golden calf that enraged Moses when he descended from 
Mt. Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching the trench when one of the boys uncovered this lovely little 
terra cotta head," recalled Sharon Girard, a computer specialist who had been 
drafted to trench-master duty here in Polis that day. "Well, I shrieked. It was 
so wonderful. All the old timers looked at me like I was nuts." 
</P>
<P>
The old timers also remember the heyday of American archeology abroad, the 
1950s when there was plenty of money for expeditions. Times are tougher now. In 
a typical year, one of the professors here said, one or two good jobs might 
open up in the archeology departments of American universities, and there will 
be five or more candidates applying for each one. Many of the grad students and 
pre-docs working summer digs will never make the archeology faculties, opting 
instead for related fields like art history or leaving education altogether. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of the trade, as a tenured professor in a top archeology department, 
the pay is about $40,000 a year, so the major rewards must be in the work 
itself -- the travel, the comradery of a dig, the intellectual challenge of 
breaking the riddle of a broken wall. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton's Childs tries to shape his digs as a teaching experience, both for 
the participants and those who read the results of his archeology. "If you 
study art, you can visualize the Parthenon, but how do you visualize how the 
Athenians lived?" he explained. "I want to paint a picture of antiquity that 
people can't have any other way."

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few days before East Germany's first free elections last March, the West 
German illustrated weekly Stern announced that it would distribute its next 
issue, free, from a point in central East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a melee of thousands of East Germans, thirsty both for 
Western-style news and the novelty of the magazine's slick presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was one of many that marked the start of an East German love affair 
with the West German press -- an affair that has begun to reshape the face of 
publishing in both Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there are few examples where the structure of a nation's press has 
altered so drastically and with such speed. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the six months since the Berlin Wall opened, circulation of East 
Germany's national newspapers has plummeted a staggering 54.7%, with the two 
main Communist dailies -- Neues Deutschland and its sister youth paper, Junge 
Welt, losing two-thirds and three-quarters of their circulation, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The current circulation leader in East Germany is the West German mass 
circulation daily Bild Zeitung -- a paper whose recipe of bare breasts, 
political gossip and occasional genuine scoops with a not-so-gentle right-wing 
twist made it the former Communist regime's class enemy No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bild now sells about 1 million copies daily in the East, roughly the same 
number as Neues Deutschland at its height. At present, every copy sold is 
imported from West Germany, but Heiner Bremer, spokesman for Bild's publisher, 
the Axel Springer Group, says regional editions are already being planned for 
East German cities such as Leipzig, Rostock and Magdeburg. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole new kind of paper for them," Bremer said. "It fills a giant hole 
in the market." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The former East German post office newspaper distribution monopoly 
collapsed early this year and was replaced by a group of four major West German 
publishers, who simply carved East Germany into quarters and have operated as 
general distributors. 
</P>
<P>
A new system is being organized that will divide the ownership between East and 
West German interests. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nearly 300 West German daily and weekly publications now circulate in East 
Germany, while the old gray-on-gray look that once marked East German 
publications has begun to disappear in the colorful fight to remain 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Told that his revamped TV weekly magazine looked exactly like a West German 
product, senior East German publishing executive Lothar Popp smiled and said, 
"That's the idea, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Major West German publishing houses have also moved quickly to buy into East 
German publishing groups that see Western help vital for their survival. 
</P>
<P>
Springer, for example, has a stake in eight East German newspapers and expects 
to invest $250 to $300 million "in the next few years" in East Germany. The 
high-brow Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung has bought into a chain of five East 
German papers that previously belonged to the Christian Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
West German magazine publishing giants such as Bauer Verlag and Gruener &amp; 
Jahr, have moved for the first time into the newspaper field by forging linkups 
with smaller, regional East German papers. 
</P>
<P>
(Some West German newspaper publishers see it as the start of a more grandiose, 
"backdoor" strategy to get into West German newspaper publishing.) 
</P>
<P>
Non-German publishers have also become involved. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Maxwell, who owns Britain's Mirror Group Newspapers, has signed a letter 
of intent to purchase a sizable stake in one of East Germany's largest 
publishing houses, the Berliner Group. 
</P>
<P>
The East Berlin-based group has a stable of properties with a combined 
circulation of about 5 million, including the East German capital's most 
important paper, the Berliner Zeitung. 
</P>
<P>
The result of this invasion from the West will accelerate the overhaul of what 
until eight months ago was arguably the most stringent and doctrinaire of all 
the Communist-controlled media. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hungarians could report fairly freely even before the end of communism 
there," Bremer said. "They too will look west for a tradition of greater 
freedom of expression, but neither they nor anyone else can possibly match the 
intensity that is here. We are also German talking with German." 
</P>
<P>
While the language may be the same, the outlook between East and West German 
frequently is not. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half a century of separation has left the two Germanys with outlooks and 
expectations often as sharply opposed as the political systems under which they 
once lived. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is this gap more visible than in the press. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans may have viewed West German television for the better part of two 
decades, but West German newspapers are a totally new experience. 
</P>
<P>
Even such basics as the number of pages in a paper tends to separate two 
cultures that for much of the past 40 years have been at opposite ends of the 
consumption scale. 
</P>
<P>
"An East German is just overwhelmed with our Saturday edition (which frequently 
runs over 100 pages)," noted Monika Zimmermann, the East Berlin correspondent 
of the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung, who has been named to take over as 
editor of Neue Zeit (New Times), one of the paper's East German acquisitions. 
"It's just too much newspaper and, anyway, it doesn't fit in the mailbox." 
</P>
<P>
Until last November's revolution, most East German papers rarely exceeded eight 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
J. Walter Thompson executive Eilika Emmerlich recalled East German reader 
outrage at the waste of precious space when a West German auto maker splashed 
an ad across two full pages. 
</P>
<P>
"For us in the West, it was a beautiful layout with lots of white space, but 
for an East German who couldn't get his own personal supply of paper because it 
was in such short supply, it was a tragic waste of space." 
</P>
<P>
The clash of such traditions, coupled with a news bias of West German papers 
toward their own home regions, has led Western publishers (with the exception 
of Bild) to view East Germany more as a market ripe for acquisition than 
expanded circulation. 
</P>
<P>
Here, West German influence may be less visible, but it will also be 
considerable in helping the development of a free, aggressive press in a region 
where free thought has been numbed by nearly 60 years of back-to-back Nazi and 
Communist dictatorships. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of West German publishers say they plan to import advisers for 
their East German media acquisitions but keep most of the existing staff 
members, even though they have turned out little more than government 
propaganda sheets for decades. 
</P>
<P>
For East Germans, the learning experience in such areas as advertising and 
computer technology is demanding. 
</P>
<P>
But West German publishers say the hardest task of all is teaching reporters 
and editors to think independently. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to develop the courage to have their own opinions, and we can only 
do that by example," Zimmermann said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Bremer: "Teaching the new (computerized) technology will be easy; the 
hard part will be tearing down the internal walls -- the walls in the mind that 
block free thinking."

O.C. MAY USE SEWAGE AS BARRIER TO SEAWATER; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: OFFICIALS PROPOSE TO USE ONLY TREATED WASTE WATER -- INSTEAD OF A 
MIXTURE OF IT AND DEEP-WELL WATER -- AS AN UNDERGROUND BARRIER TO SEAWATER.

<P>
Orange County water officials want to inject millions of gallons of undiluted 
but highly treated sewage into the ground every day to conserve water and stem 
the tide of seawater migrating from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
State water-quality officials commend the Orange County Water District's 
proposal as a good way to turn waste into a resource. But health officials are 
trying to determine if the waste water might pose a risk to public health if it 
flows into underground drinking-water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
For 15 years, the water district has pumped a blend of one-third deep-well 
water and two-thirds treated waste water underground as a barrier to seawater 
flowing into the county's valuable ground-water basin, which serves 2 million 
people. Now it proposes to use only treated waste water, conserving water that 
could be used to supply Orange County residents in drought periods. 
</P>
<P>
"After (treatment), the waste water is as clean, if not cleaner, than the 
imported water supply we're drinking right now," said James Van Haun, spokesman 
for the Orange County Water District. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, up to 15 million gallons of the waste-and-water mix are injected 
daily into the ground via 23 wells along Ellis Avenue in Fountain Valley. The 
change to straight waste water would save about 5 million gallons of water a 
day, enough for 5,000 households per year. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the amount of treated waste injected would double to 30 
million gallons daily. 
</P>
<P>
Before the switch can occur, the regional Santa Ana board of the California 
Regional Water Quality Control Board must approve it. 
</P>
<P>
"From a water-quality perspective, we're in favor of the project," said Jerry 
Thibeault, executive officer of the regional board. 
</P>
<P>
"It provides a good steady source of supply to stop seawater intrusion, and it 
doesn't use water that can be used for domestic supply." 
</P>
<P>
But approval cannot be granted by the regional board unless the state health 
department determines that the straight waste water would have no adverse 
effects on drinking water. Officials from the two agencies held a joint public 
hearing last week, with a final decision expected in October. 
</P>
<P>
"The big question is, if they change their approach, could it have an impact on 
public drinking supplies down the road?" said Kurt Berchtold, assistant 
executive officer of the regional water board. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest municipal drinking well, in Huntington Beach, is about 1,700 feet 
from the nearest injection point, and it would take at least three years, 
probably longer, for the reclaimed waste water to flow there, water district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The water is purified at Water Factory 21, the district's state-of-the-art 
treatment plant in Fountain Valley, considered the most sophisticated in the 
world. It uses five treatment processes to remove pollutants from waste water. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said the waste water is so thoroughly treated that it meets 
drinking-water standards for toxic pollutants and bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
But health officials worry that small amounts of carbon-based chemicals found 
in waste could slowly seep into the basin that supplies drinking water, said 
Frank Hamamura, an engineer in the Santa Ana district of the state Department 
of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals, types of organic carbons, are poorly understood and in minute 
quantities, but they could pose a long-term health threat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A decision has not been made yet. We're dealing with some substances that we 
don't have much information about yet, and we have to weigh it to see if this 
is really a health concern or not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamamura said the treatment removes other contaminants in sewage, including 
bacteria and viruses. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen monitoring wells in the injection area are tested for contaminants. 
Also, the county's drinking-water wells are tested regularly, with about 12,000 
samples taken annually. 
</P>
<P>
Van Haun said 15 years of tests on Water Factory 21's reclaimed waste water 
have not detected viruses or bacteria. He added that if the project is 
approved, the district would start extra monitoring for more contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sense is that we'll obtain approval with a few stipulations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason that water district officials want to stop blending the waste water 
with deep-well water is that they found a way to start using that water for 
drinking supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the deep water had an unpalatable brown color, but now the water 
agency has come up with a way to remove the color and make it a usable supply. 
Every drop counts, they say, especially because the state is facing a 4-year 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to preserve it now, because it will provide a very viable water source 
here in the near future," Van Haun said. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials said the seawater barrier project is extremely important. If 
saltwater got into the ground-water basin, it would render the underground 
drinking supply useless. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's huge underground lake, which contains millions of gallons of 
water, is a rare, invaluable resource. It makes the county less vulnerable to 
drought than most of Southern California, which relies more heavily on 
expensive water imported from the drought-plagued Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's state legislative delegation has supported the proposal to stop 
the blending. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the water board, the 13 legislators commended the district for 
its exemplary record in water quality and said the change "will not result in a 
relaxation of existing water-quality standards" and will save water, "which is 
critically important during times of drought." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Water District is known internationally for its innovative, 
advanced ways of protecting ground water and tapping into it for drinking 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a first-class organization, and they're doing a real good job of 
monitoring the ground-water basin. That gives us more confidence about this 
proposal," Thibeault said. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the water consumed in the northern half of Orange County comes 
from the ground-water basin. Underground water from Irvine south is not used 
for drinking supplies, mostly because it is too salty.

STATE CUTS IN HEALTH FUNDS ARE CRITICIZED; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: AGREEMENT REACHED BY THE LEGISLATURE ELIMINATES $14 MILLION FOR 
EMERGENCY CARE FOR THE POOR IN ORANGE COUNTY.

Cuts in state funding for emergency medical care to the poor were described 
Monday as just another "devastating blow" to an Orange County program that has 
always been inadequately funded. 
</P>
<P>
"We just lost $14 million in funding, and we're always short there anyway," 
said Ernie Schneider, county chief administrative officer. "There's not enough 
money for adequate indigent care." 
</P>
<P>
The seriousness of the cuts in the long-awaited $55-billion state budget the 
Legislature passed Saturday was beginning to hit home Monday, especially those 
cuts earmarked for the county's Indigent Medical Services program, which 
reimburses local hospitals for the treatment of more than 22,000 patients a 
year. County officials said most of the people the program covers are accident 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Under the budget passed by lawmakers, the Indigent Medical Services program 
would lose $14 million, a 55.3% reduction from its base budget of $24.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The action brought harsh criticism from all sectors of government and the 
health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
Calling it a "tremendous hit on Orange County," State Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach), said it was a "devasting blow to the program -- a program 
with no alternative revenue sources and no safety net." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said the formula used to determine the amounts cut from the county 
program was unfair and was not agreed to by the state Senate when it passed the 
budget bill. 
</P>
<P>
"The services are going to have to be provided. These are the people who fall 
through the cracks and have no means for medical care. We are required to 
provide the treatment, and somehow we are going to have to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson and state Sens. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), Dan McCorquodale (D-San 
Jose) and Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose) are the co-authors of a letter to 
Deukmejian asking him to veto the apportionment language in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said the bill that went to the governor's desk made the cuts to the 
program on a per capita basis. When the bill left the Senate, the program 
reductions had been substantially less for Orange County under a different 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
Many top county officials said Monday that they are waiting to see how much 
money the governor would cut from the budget. Deukmejian was expected to veto 
hundreds of millions of dollars in programs before signing the $55-billion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
But the strongest reaction was to the Indigent Medical Services program cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cruel joke balancing the budget by withholding services to sick mothers 
and children and the working poor," said Chauncey Alexander, chairman of the 
United Way Health Care Task Force. "Balancing the budget on the backs of the 
poor is a disgraceful activity." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Furmin, president of the Orange County Coalition of Community Clinics, 
said the reductions will just compound existing health care problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Access will be more difficult. Medical problems will be more complex," Furmin 
said. "In fact, were are going to see much more of a drain on the health system 
because a lot of situations which could be handled with low-cost care now will 
escalate." 
</P>
<P>
County figures show that the overall 1989-1990 budget for Indigent Medical 
Services was $33 million. But, officials said, $9 million of that came from 
other programs that will no longer be available for indigent care. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Forbath, founder and director of the Share Our Selves Clinic, which serves 
the homeless and working poor in Costa Mesa, called the proposed cut "horrible 
news." 
</P>
<P>
"It will have a devastating effect," Forbath said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Hospital Council of Southern California, which represents the 28 largest 
hospitals in Orange County, vice president David Langness also expressed anger. 
</P>
<P>
"My response is almost unprintable," he said. "These are the budget cuts that 
everyone feared the most that will create, I think, just a massive amount of 
disruptions, morbidity and mortality." 
</P>
<P>
Langness said hospital representatives were lobbying Monday to head off further 
cuts by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Education's TEACHING 
</P>
<P>
The most important lesson of the state budget battle is that initiatives work.

SOVIET TEAM MUSCLES INTO COUNTY;

BODYBUILDERS HAVE UPLIFTING TIME WORKING OUT, SHOPPING AND EATING

The advanced machinery and bright lighting of Gold's Gym here were as dazzling 
to the Soviet national bodybuilding team as the sun and ocean at Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
After having had to practice their sport in secret until two years ago, when 
bodybuilding first received official government sanction, the Soviet 
bodybuilders were clearly in their glory Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't just the high-tech gym that left them overwhelmed. It also was 
getting chances Sunday and Monday to do things unremarkable to the average 
Southern Californian but exotic to them -- visiting Newport Beach and 
Disneyland, shopping at South Coast Plaza and eating prodigious amounts of food 
at Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
As the team members were consuming pancakes, eggs, sausage and bacon after 
their morning workout, they agreed that American food is much better than 
anything available to them in their homeland. They liked it so much, in fact, 
that several ordered seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 25-member entourage leaves for San Francisco, where the athletes 
will participate in an exhibition with American bodybuilders on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They walked in here . . . and their jaws dropped," said Vodak Hawkins, owner 
of Gold's Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing equivalent to Gold's exists in the Soviet Union. In fact, before they 
received the official sanction, the bodybuilders worked out in the basements of 
their apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't officially sanctioned; they were not supposed to be doing it," 
said Russell Valentino, interpreter for the 25-member Soviet team. "And 
although probably no one was persecuted for it or went to jail, it was strongly 
discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Smith, producer of the ESPN "Muscle Magazine" show, brought the Soviets to 
the United States for the San Francisco exhibition, which will be televised at 
a later date. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who traveled to the Soviet Union in March, 1988, for a show about Soviet 
bodybuilders, said the equipment there appeared to him to be homemade. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we're very behind," said Ain Paavo through the team's 
interpreter. Paavo is a member of the Soviet team and also a European champion. 
"We have the same machines, they're just 20 years older." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Soviet bodybuilders, Smith said, first competed in other sports and 
took up bodybuilding after being sidelined by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Paavo, for instance, was a weightlifter before he broke his left arm. Team 
member Nikolai Grishanov is a former Olympic weightlifting champion who bears a 
large scar on his right knee, the result of an injury that ended that career. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said bodybuilding is a low-impact sport that injured Soviet athletes 
often use for rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
But now that the sport has government approval, Soviet athletes have other 
motives to train. 
</P>
<P>
Enna Uit, the only woman on the Soviet team, is officially employed as an 
athletic trainer, as are most of her teammates. But with perestroika, Uit is 
now allowed to make her living as a bodybuilder. She estimates that as many 
women as men compete in bodybuilding in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Over their generous American breakfasts, the athletes talked about other 
conditions in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Uit, a native of the republic of Estonia, said she lives and trains under a 
strict food-rationing system not conducive to building muscle quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Gorelik, a team member from Vilnius, Lithuania, lives under similar 
conditions. "It is very difficult there," Gorelik said in English. "Now we have 
no food, no oil." 
</P>
<P>
Before breakfast, several team members went with Hawkins to the gift shop at 
Gold's and traded Soviet T-shirts (white shirts with a red "CCCP" and hammer 
and sickle logo) for Gold's Gym T-shirts and sweat suits. 
</P>
<P>
After breakfast, Smith said, he was "going to blow their minds" by taking the 
team shopping at South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Many had only a few dollars. They window shopped, gazing with fascination at 
the artificial diamonds at May Co. 
</P>
<P>
A few had enough money to buy some of the alluring American goods, however. One 
bodybuilder bought a leather skirt for his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he liked most about the United States so far, European champ Paavo 
first said the Pacific Ocean, then he said the food. 
</P>
<P>
But then he added: "We knew that you lived well here. We didn't know that there 
were such nice, friendly people here. Everybody goes around with a sourpuss on 
their face in the Soviet Union."

ONGOING NEIGHBORS' FIGHT LEAVES 1 MAN DEAD

A 26-year-old man who got into a fight with two of his neighbors over his 
treatment of a little girl allegedly stabbed one of them to death after going 
to a store and purchasing a steak knife, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors chased down the suspect, Felipe Patricio of Fullerton, and held him 
for police. He was being held without bail at Orange County Jail on suspicion 
of murder in connection with the death of Abel Enrique Luna, 24. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Luna was trying to protect an unidentified woman from Patricio 
after she told the suspect to stop pulling a 10-year-old girl by the hair. 
Patricio slapped the woman and Luna intervened, triggering a string of 
arguments and fights that ended with Luna's death late Sunday night, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Several neighbors, including Maria Becerra, who described herself as Patricio's 
girlfriend, said the suspect had been drinking heavily that day. 
</P>
<P>
According to neighbors, Patricio and Luna began to argue about 3 p.m. after 
Patricio scolded the 10-year-old for the way she was taking care of an infant. 
After he pulled the girl's hair, her mother demanded to know why. Patricio then 
slapped her, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Becerra said that Luna then walked over to the couple's open window and 
demanded to see Patricio. As soon as her boyfriend stepped outside of their 
apartment, Becerra said, the two men started fighting in the small courtyard of 
their East Wilshire Avenue apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
"I yelled at them to calm down," Becerra said in Spanish, adding that she 
called police when the men continued to fight. 
</P>
<P>
However, Fullerton Police Detective Sgt. Danny Becerra said officers first 
answered a call at the apartment complex about 8 p.m. Danny Becerra and Maria 
Becerra are not related. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Becerra said that Luna won the fistfight, leaving Patricio bleeding from 
the nose, eye and mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Patricio left the area, walked down to a Lucky Food Center about a 
block a way, purchased a small steak knife and returned. Police said that about 
10:45 p.m., Luna approached Patricio, made several hostile remarks and the two 
began fighting again. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that this time, Patricio stabbed Luna. Luna was taken to St. Jude 
Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton with three stab wounds in the 
upper chest and one in the right thigh. He died about 11:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Martinez, 11, said he came out of his home just as that fight ended. He 
said he saw Luna on the ground and Patricio running away. He said that he and 
about six men, including some of Luna's friends, chased Patricio, catching him 
about a block away. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that they expect the Orange County district attorney's office to 
file formal murder charges against Patricio today. 
</P>
<P>
Told that Luna had been killed, Maria Becerra expressed surprise, saying that 
as far as she knew Patricio did not have a knife. She added that her boyfriend 
is normally a very gentle man. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't fight with anybody," she said, fighting back tears. "He is a good 
man."

DERWINSKI HAS UPBEAT MESSAGE ON VA BUDGET 
</P>

<P>
Seeking to calm fears of massive funding cuts, the U.S. secretary of veterans 
affairs assured several thousand disabled soldiers Monday that they can count 
on more money this year for medical and other needs. 
</P>
<P>
But some among the 5,000 delegates to the 69th national convention of the 
Disabled American Veterans did not buy Secretary Edward J. Derwinski's upbeat 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a politician," grumbled Tom Garrett of Las Vegas, 61, a Navy veteran who 
now uses a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"He talks a lot and makes lot of promises but says nothing. What we want is a 
firm commitment that the government is going to honor its commitment to us and 
take care of our needs." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the chief spokesman for Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.), 
chairman of the House Veteran Affairs committee, said the secretary's comments 
may give an overly optimistic picture of the current budget talks between 
congressional leaders and the Bush Administration, which has recommended a 
$1-billion increase in funds for veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows for certain what's going to happen," committee aide Jim Holley 
said in an interview. "The holdup now is the budget summit, but we've already 
been instructed (by congressional leaders) to get ready for a half-billion 
dollars in veterans' cuts -- and that's a minimum figure." 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski acknowledged in his talk that "I have not seen in my 32 years in 
Washington a situation as complicated and as difficult as the budget problem 
they're struggling with in Washington. Now we are the innocent victims -- we 
the VA budget and, therefore, the veterans." 
</P>
<P>
But he continued: "We were looking forward to a budget increase, we are going 
to get one, we're going to have more money this year than we had last year. . . 
. But the big problem is, do we get enough to cover the rising cost of 
medicine? That's the $64 question for us." 
</P>
<P>
Veterans' funding was foremost on the minds of many of those attending the 
Anaheim convention. The VA's current $30-billion budget provides for medical 
care, home loan guarantees, life insurance and pensions for veterans and their 
51 million dependents and survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Although funding for federal programs has become tighter in recent years, the 
VA has managed to escape cuts and maintain its funding, officials said. The 
agency is especially threatened this year, however, some veterans' leaders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
They cite a recent General Accounting Office report in which cuts were 
recommended in money for military personnel who have sustained non-service 
injuries, and the fact that a VA committee is considering, along with other 
cost-cutting measures, trimming some marginally disabled veterans from the 
federal rolls. 
</P>
<P>
The rising cost of medical care and the graying of today's veterans -- those 
over 75 are expected to number 2.6 million by 1996, nearly double the number 
today -- have also caused some alarm about the security of veterans' programs.

FIREFIGHTERS RESCUED NEAR CATALINA ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen Anaheim firefighters were pulled from the ocean off Santa Catalina 
Island on Monday afternoon after a 67-foot sailboat ran aground on a hidden 
reef during a race from Long Beach, the U.S. Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The schooner Diosa del Mar was sailing in an annual firefighters race with 
scores of other craft when it grounded at 2:45 p.m. and partially sank on Ship 
Rock about a mile off Catalina, forcing those aboard into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The 82-foot Coast Guard cutter Point Evans, which was in the area on routine 
patrol, arrived within about two minutes of the accident, took the passengers 
aboard and put them ashore at Isthmus Cove on the island, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured.

WATCH IS KEPT ON SAGGING SIDEWALK 
</P>

When she first got the call that a sidewalk was moving at a downtown park, 
Deputy City Clerk Roe Allen said that she didn't know what to think. But the 
unidentified woman was adamant. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she wanted to report the sidewalk was moving at Heisler Park near the 
bowling green and that we better get somebody out there right away to look at 
it," Allen said. The Friday caller insisted that she could actually see the 
pathway shift. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't take it too seriously because we get a lot of crazy calls here," 
Allen said, "but I did follow through." 
</P>
<P>
The call was no hoax, city workers discovered when they arrived at the site 
about 4:30 p.m. About 20 feet of walkway near Jasmine Street and Cliff Drive 
had simply slid 2 to 3 feet into the cliff above the ocean. After checking with 
Caltech in Pasadena on Monday, Municipal Services Director Terry Brandt ruled 
out the possibility that the landslide was caused by seismic activity. The 
cause, he concluded, was recent high tides and high surf. 
</P>
<P>
The area where the approximately 8-foot-wide walkway collapsed is the scene of 
previous erosion, he said. About five years ago, a tree in the vicinity was 
uprooted by erosion, Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
The area has been cordoned off and is being watched around the clock by beach 
patrol and police officers. Geologists will determine what can be done to 
repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Litwin, the first beach patrol officer on the site when the landslide 
was reported, said the slide started with a slight fracture in the earth. 
</P>
<P>
"It started out a really small crack and just started getting bigger,' she 
said. 'It . . . very gradually fell." LESLIE EARNEST

<P>
An Irvine woman was attacked Monday by a man who broke into her apartment, 
threatened her with a pair of scissors and demanded money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old woman, whose name was not released, received minor injuries 
during the 5:40 a.m. incident, Police Sgt. Dave Frew said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman apparently awoke after hearing noises in her apartment in the 300 
block of Berkeley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
When she went into another room to investigate, "the suspect confronted (her) 
with a pair of scissors and forced her back into the bedroom," Frew said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect demanded money and fled, Frew said. The sergeant was uncertain 
whether the suspect got away with any money. MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; 
</P>
<P>
NEW ADVISORY PANEL WILL BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recommendation to replace the former North Tustin Municipal Advisory Council 
with a new five-member advisory board is scheduled for consideration by the 
county Board of Supervisors on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors dissolved the council in June to save money. 
</P>
<P>
The new body, like the old, would make recommendations on North Tustin issues, 
but would save the costs of elections because members would be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the recommendation by the county Environmental Management Agency, each 
supervisor whose district includes the North Tustin area would appoint one 
member. The fourth would be appointed at large by the supervisors, and the 
fifth would be selected by the Foothill Communities Assn. The group would meet 
once a month in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Weber, president of the Foothill Communities Assn., said his group will 
not take a position on the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see who they appoint, we will appoint our member, and the proof of the 
pudding will be in what they do," Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert White, an acting manager of the EMA, said that appointments probably 
will be made within weeks of the supervisors' decision. People who are 
interested in serving on the advisory group should call White at (714) 834-5145 
or write him at 12 Civic Center, Room G19, Santa Ana 92702, and include a brief 
resume. 
</P>
<P>
"It's helpful to have a group like that," White said. "People living in the 
area obviously know some of the idiosyncrasies better than we do."

MAN IS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO BURN WIFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Garden Grove man, apparently upset because his wife did not want his mother 
to stay with them during her upcoming visit, was arrested on suspicion of 
trying to burn his wife to death, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Gary Walker said that Sang Seon Kim, 30, and Kyoung Hui Yang, 25, 
apparently had been arguing for some time Sunday when they started destroying 
each other's possessions. 
</P>
<P>
As the dispute grew, investigators said that Kim began collecting books and 
newspapers and piled them on the couple's bed. He dragged his wife into their 
bedroom, poured cooking oil all over the room and then set the bed on fire, 
Walker said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"But she was somehow able to get away and make it past the door and outside the 
apartment." Police said she had not been bound. 
</P>
<P>
When police and firefighters arrived, Yang was crawling down the stairs, 
screaming that her husband was trying to kill her, Walker said. Minutes later, 
Kim came walking out of the smoky apartment and surrendered to police. 
</P>
<P>
Yang suffered minor cuts and bruises, Walker said. She was taken to Garden 
Grove Medical Center and later released. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those disputes that got larger and larger," Walker said. 
"He was apparently very upset that his wife refused to let his mother stay with 
them while she visits from Korea." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors at the apartment at 9722 Alwood Ave. notified police after hearing 
the couple fighting, Walker said. Police were immediately called again after 
the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said neighbors had expressed shock about the incident and indicated that 
the newlywed couple were always friendly and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Fire Department Capt. Bill Dumasit said the fire caused extensive 
damage to the apartment but never threatened to spread. ERIK HAMILTON

7 YEARS GIVEN IN INVESTMENT SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas D. Carter, accused of bilking investors of up to $55 million in one of 
Orange County's largest investment fraud cases, was sentenced to more than 
seven years in prison Monday after pleading no contest last March to 22 counts 
of selling unregistered securities. 
</P>
<P>
But the 38-year-old Carter, formerly of Corona del Mar, will escape prosecution 
on 44 more serious counts of fraud and grand theft. Superior Court Judge Myron 
S. Brown dismissed those charges following Monday's sentencing, explaining that 
even if Carter were found guilty after a lengthy trial, his prison sentence 
would not be appreciably longer. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's action drew sharp criticism from the prosecutor as well as from an 
angry group of mostly elderly investors who gathered outside the courtroom 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous. He steals millions and gets a slap on the hand," said 
64-year-old Westminster resident Jean Cademartori, who lost $13,000 to Carter's 
investment scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Sevigny, who argued that Carter should be tried on the 
more serious counts, said it is likely that his office will appeal the 
dismissal in hopes of getting the charges reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Carter has denied intentionally defrauding the investors. According to Sevigny, 
he has said that he relied on bad advice from attorneys and did not complete 
the proper paper work before selling the securities. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, whose possessions included a $1-million home in Corona del Mar and a 
fleet of luxury cars, once said his dream was to build an entertainment empire 
to rival Disneyland. His most recent home was in Henderson, Nev., and he is 
under investigation in that state as well, Sevigny said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 2,800 investors believed to have been bilked by Carter's investment 
firms described him as an affable, "all-American boy" who lured them with his 
charm and promises of making a 46% annual return on their money. 
</P>
<P>
Sevigny said Carter's scam was a classic Ponzi scheme, referring to a type of 
investment fraud that works by paying off old investors with money from new 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's empire, according to Sevigny, began to crumble in 1983 when the 
Securities and Exchange Commission accused him in federal court of defrauding 
investors of millions of dollars through a bogus investment plan called medical 
factoring. 
</P>
<P>
Medical factoring was purportedly the business of purchasing medical claims at 
a discount from hospitals and doctors and then redeeming them at full value 
from the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
But in reality, according to Sevigny, "there was no purchase of any medical 
accounts receivables. . . . There were no claims redeemed with insurance 
companies. There were no profits at all. . . . The Carter Co. was merely a 
conduit for funds for Tom Carter's own use personally and in his other 
ambitious business enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
Within months of the SEC accusation, Carter agreed, without admitting or 
denying guilt, to an injunction that barred him from selling securities. He and 
his company filed for bankruptcy, and the SEC dropped its inquiry. However, the 
Orange County district attorney's office continued its investigation and filed 
the 66 counts against him in 1984.

PEOPLE: AT 4, SHE'D ALREADY FINGERED HER CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HERBERT J. VIDA

<TEXT>
<P>
It didn't take long for Harriet Wood to find her musical niche in life. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a harp record when I was 4 years old and told my parents that was the 
music I wanted to play," said Wood, who now plays engagements all over the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Wood first started playing piano, though, because her mother was a pianist. But 
when she was 7, she rented a harp with money saved from her allowance. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother decided if I was that determined, she would get me a harp, and I've 
been playing one ever since." Wood went on to study music at the University of 
Oregon and at the Juilliard School of Music, and she has taught harp at 
Fullerton College and Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, who lives in Long Beach, has for 11 years been playing for the Sunday 
brunch crowd on the Queen Mary. She has been a member of the Disneyland 
Orchestra; played three years at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, often 
as a soloist, and performed at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel in Costa Mesa 
for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
During those years, Wood was one of a number of musicians who visited Orange 
County elementary schools to show and play their instruments to the children. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those years I would visit 60 schools," she said. "It was an 
educational program that gave the students an up-close look at various 
instruments." 
</P>
<P>
Her interest in the harp has never waned. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to play it,"she said. "Having the sound around me is just as pleasing 
to me as it has ever been." 
</P>
<P>
She apparently has passed on her enthusiasm to her daughter, Marsha, 30, who 
plays harp at the Westgate Hotel in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The harp sound is becoming more popular, Wood says. She performs at receptions 
for women's clubs, weddings, bar mitzvahs and in theme programs for Valentine's 
Day, Easter and Halloween. Recently, Wood played at the reception of the 
Radiation and Health Fair at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun doing programs," she said. "Sometimes I pick up ideas for the theme 
by reading the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
One of her themes, for example, revolved around wigs -- Wood played music from 
countries where wigs were developed. 
</P>
<P>
The harp is popular for such events, she says, because "people find it is nice 
background for dinner music because they can talk over it, even in groups" and 
the flavor of the harp sound won't be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Even with her playing schedule, Wood still practices every day. 
</P>
<P>
"You never get so good you know everything," she says. Besides, "it's a lot of 
work to keep my fingers calloused so they don't hurt when I play. You do that 
by practicing." 
</P>
<P>
Wood said she doesn't get much attention from the audience when she's providing 
the background music, but "that doesn't bother me a bit. I'm usually wrapped up 
in the sound of what I'm doing." She noted, though, that there are people who 
do pay attention to the music, much of which she arranges herself. 
</P>
<P>
The songs range from classical to popular. She says she likes all music 
equally. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to make everything I play as orchestral as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the success of their own fund-raising and some help from parents, 14 
members of the Huntington Beach Junior Lifeguard Team will compete in the World 
Lifesaving Championships in Lubeck, Germany, next month. 
</P>
<P>
That event, which takes place Aug. 11 through 15, will have teams from 30 
countries. To make sure they're tuned up for it, the Huntington Beach group 
will be competing in another meet in Wales this Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The students who are participating are between 14 and 18 years old and were 
chosen from among 700 swimmers in the program. They are Julie Jackle, Louis 
Lopez, Amy Martin, Juli Anna Matto, Keith Metzger, Wendy Monahan, Jeffery 
Moohr, Kellie Ortega, Chad A. Prior, David J. Prior, Kelli Quinn, Greg Reddish, 
Erin Staunton and Bryan Walker.

as the water polo coach at Chapman College, the school announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who has coached aquatics at Troy and La Habra high schools, has 1 1/2 
months before the Panthers open their season Sept. 12 against Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
"The main emphasis right now is to recruit new kids for the team that are 
already attending Chapman," Brown said. "Last year, Chapman only had eight or 
nine players, and it takes seven to field a team." 
</P>
<P>
Brown earned his teaching credential at Chapman in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Blake, a pitcher on Chapman's softball team, was named to the GTE 
Academic All-American first team. Blake, who will be a senior this fall, was a 
first-team all-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. selection with an 18-5 
record and an 0.39 earned-run average. She also batted .369. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapman baseball team lost the left side of its infield and its entire 
outfield from last year's team, but Coach Mike Weathers has signed 10 players. 
</P>
<P>
They are: Robert Parga, a pitcher from Los Angeles Harbor; Steve McKowen, an 
outfielder from Golden West; Jim Henderson, an outfielder from L.A. Harbor; 
Clifford Anderson from Southwestern College in Chula Vista; Chris Sauritch, an 
infielder from El Toro High; Shawn Nugent, an infielder from Cerritos College; 
Kevin Monson, an outfielder from Fullerton College; Marvin Mack, an outfielder 
from Long Beach College; James Gore, an outfielder from Rancho Buena Vista High 
in San Diego, and Gus Munguray, a catcher from L.A. Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
New Vanguards: They aren't household names, but Southern California College 
Coach Bill Reynolds has added five players to his men's basketball team, which 
advanced to the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics tournament last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
They are: Darren Kramer, a 6-foot-7 post player from Long Beach College; Mike 
West, a 6-3 sophomore from Point Loma Nazarene who was an all-San Diego Section 
player from Fallbrook High; Kyle Campanelli, a 6-3 all-Camino Norte Conference 
forward from Santa Rosa College who is the son of California basketball coach 
Lou Campanelli; Ron Scipio, a 5-10 point guard who played at Grand Canyon 
College and L.A. City College in '84 and '85 and has been an assistant coach at 
Manual Arts High; and Brad Dorais, a 5-8 point guard from Eastern Wyoming 
Junior College. 
</P>
<P>
Better late than . . . : Corey Smith, a 6-2 guard from Southern Section 4-AA 
champion Glendora High School, has signed a letter of intent to play basketball 
at Christ College Irvine, the college announced Tuesday. Smith, who averaged 14 
points and four assists a game and was the Baseline League's most valuable 
player, is the first player signed by Greg Marshall, Christ College's new men's 
basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall got a late start recruiting because he was hired May 16, five weeks 
after the first day high school students could sign letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not frustrating, but because it was late when I got the job, there were a 
lot of players that had already signed," Marshall said. "I'll probably be 
recruiting right up to the start of school." 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Chapman women's volleyball team has signed three players to letters of 
intent: Heather McKinley, a middle blocker and outside hitter from El Modena 
High School; Tara Christensen, a middle blocker from Santa Rosa College, and 
Diana French, a setter from Petaluma High. . . . Christ College Irvine will 
open its women's volleyball season by playing host to a 14-team tournament Aug. 
31 and Sept. 1. Cal Poly Pomona, Cal State Los Angeles, Southern California 
College, UC San Diego and Alaska Fairbanks are among the teams entered.

JOE MILLER FIRED AS SAN CLEMENTE COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Miller was fired as the baseball coach at San Clemente High School, the 
school's athletic director, Jim McNaught, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was dismissed from his position in June, at the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons were 22-64-1 overall during Miller's four years as coach. San 
Clemente was 13-47 in South Coast League play during that time and never 
finished higher than fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
McNaught said Miller's won-loss record had nothing to do with the dismissal, 
which was handled by principal Jim Krembus. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who was the head coach at Fountain Valley in 1982, will remain at the 
school as a science teacher. 
</P>
<P>
McNaught said he expected a new coach would be hired before the start of the 
school year. He said Krembus was in the process of interviewing candidates for 
the job. CHRIS FOSTER

The National Candy Wholesalers Assn., aiming to boost the annual candy 
consumption of Americans to 20 pounds per person from 19.7 pounds, has a list 
of "Candy Facts" to soothe your guilty conscience and persuade you that sweet 
treats may even be good for you. 
</P>
<P>
Association President William Elfenbein of Denver admits that some of the 
statements -- such as "Candy doesn't make you fat" and "Candy is nutritious" -- 
probably would make nutritionists shudder. 
</P>
<P>
And he concedes that too much of anything can be bad. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't want to eat just candy," said Elfenbein, 53, who is in Atlanta 
for the group's convention. "But for most people it could be the bright note in 
a very dull day." 
</P>
<P>
Connie Crawley, a registered dietitian at the University of Georgia, agreed 
balance is the key. 
</P>
<P>
"Sugar has no nutritional value at all except calories. We don't promote sugar, 
but we aren't saying it's the worst food and you should never eat it again," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the 7,000 buyers and distributors attending the convention at the Georgia 
World Congress Center weren't counting calories last week as they wandered 
through a trick-or-treater's paradise filled with mouth-watering wonders. 
</P>
<P>
They gorged themselves on new and old goodies in a sample room filled with 
every candy bar imaginable, including favorites such as Zero, Almond Joy, Milky 
Way, Red Hots and Sweet Tarts. 
</P>
<P>
"We give everybody a sack and let them go through the room. Some eat while they 
fill up their bags," said Shelley Grossman Estersohn, communications director 
for the Washington-based association. 
</P>
<P>
Estersohn said the group is hoping candy consumption will rise on its own to 20 
pounds per person by the end of the year. The list of Candy Facts was contained 
in a handout available to buyers and reporters attending the convention.

FRESHNESS IN CENTER'S NEXT STAGE PACKAGE; 
</P>
<P>
MOST OF THE MUSICALS IN NEXT SEASON'S BROADWAY SERIES ARE PROVEN HITS OF RECENT 
VINTAGE.

<P>
Half full or half empty? 
</P>
<P>
The question must be asked, now that the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
has announced next season's Broadway Series of "A Chorus Line," "Grand Hotel," 
"Meet Me in St. Louis," "Les Miserables" and "Jerome Robbins' Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
Is the programming better and fresher overall than past seasons, as Center 
officials themselves are saying? Far and away, the answer is yes. There are no 
warhorse revivals this time around, at least not the sort of golden oldies that 
have lived longer and drained more blood than Dracula. 
</P>
<P>
There is no "South Pacific" or "Can-Can," which were featured in the first 
series; no "Camelot," which fortunately was canceled before it arrived for the 
second, or "Anything Goes," which unfortunately wasn't canceled, and no "The 
King and I," which may have set a record for tedium in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the upcoming series bloat itself on such offerings as "The Music of 
Andrew Lloyd Webber: A Concert" or "Elvis: A Musical Celebration," which for 
all their popularity could no more be called Broadway musicals than the 
big-band interludes during "Tonight Show" commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Except for "Meet Me in St. Louis" (a period piece that cost a reported $6 
million but closed in June after just seven months) and "A Chorus Line" (which 
dates back to 1976), all the shows next season are proven Broadway hits of 
recent vintage. That's three out of five. And "St. Louis" might have been a 
hit, says its advocates, if not for the New York snobbery of key critics. 
</P>
<P>
As to "A Chorus Line," there can be no quarrel with its historic significance 
as a groundbreaking American musical nor with its merits as singular 
entertainment. A production doesn't become the longest-running Broadway show 
ever without giving real value. But the tour producer's notion that the show's 
April closing in New York has created a wave of "Chorus Line" nostalgia in 
Orange County -- as he claims has happened nationwide -- is open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
All sorts of amateur troupes, always hungry for unreleased material, have 
licensed the stage rights to the show ever since it closed. Generating audience 
fervor may not be so easy, however. In Los Angeles, for instance, a critically 
acclaimed professional production of "A Chorus Line" called it quits Sunday 
because of mediocre ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the purported nostalgia for a "farewell tour" of the authorized Broadway 
version will materialize at the Center. Certainly, the Indianapolis-based 
producer, Robert Young Associates, is counting on it. Young and others are 
putting the show on the road for 50 weeks in a classic bus-and-truck operation 
at a total cost of about $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
"A Chorus Line" will shake the dust from its feet in Costa Mesa immediately 
following a very hectic schedule: one week split between Pasadena and Santa 
Barbara and another week split between Fresno and Albuquerque. With that kind 
of mileage, can the performers be expected to duplicate the quality of the 
Broadway original? Sure they can. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "Grand Hotel" is slated for the Center after it plays for four weeks 
at the Pantages Theatre in Los Angles, according to New York producer Marvin 
Krauss. The arrival of "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" will follow a four-month run 
in Los Angeles at the Shubert Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to impugn the freshness of these shows, both of which are still on 
Broadway and both of which are touring for the first time. It is merely a 
reminder that you can catch them sooner than later, if freshness is a paramount 
concern and you don't mind taking a drive. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that drive may be the only way to guarantee seeing two of the 
Tony-winning performances from the original Robbins show, because both 
performers are signed for the Los Angeles production but have not been signed 
yet for the rest of the tour. Given the wear and tear of the road, they might 
well choose to do other things by the time the show gets to the Center. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to the matter of touting the number of Tonys earned by the 
original productions. "Collectively, these five musicals have won 28 Tony 
Awards," Center president Thomas R. Kendrick pointed out last week in an 
interview. "And they've had about twice that many nominations." 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely true. But all Tonys do not carry equally translatable weight for 
touring productions. Winning performers who don't go on the road with a show 
obviously can't be counted, while Tonys in technical categories such as set and 
lighting, which can only be approximated on the road, ought not to count as 
much as those for more substantive categories such as best score. 
</P>
<P>
Of the five shows coming to the Center, just two -- "Les Miz" and "A Chorus 
Line" -- won Tonys for their scores. Ironically, they're also the least fresh. 
("Les Miz" opened on Broadway in 1987 and played for 14 months in Los Angeles.) 
By the same token, they're also the only two with Tonys for best book, another 
substantive category with durable value. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Tommy Tune won two Tonys for "Grand Hotel" this year -- best 
choreography and best direction -- and he will oversee the road production. 
Similarly, Jerome Robbins, who won for best direction of "Jerome Robbins' 
Broadway" last year, will also oversee his road show. Both men have reputations 
as sticklers for quality and can be expected to put their artistic stamp on 
these outings. 
</P>
<P>
As for "Meet Me in St. Louis," it is harder to predict what the quality is 
likely to be. The show, which cost a reported $6 million on Broadway, got four 
Tony nominations this year, all in substantive categories: best musical, score, 
book and choreography. But it didn't win in any of them. And the lavish 
costumes and opulent scenery came in for more praise than the musical itself, 
despite the nominations. 
</P>
<P>
The "St. Louis" road production, which is currently being assembled and has yet 
to be cast, will include the original costumes and props. But the size of the 
set -- which featured fireworks, an ice-skating rink and a clanging trolley car 
on Broadway -- will probably be cut down. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it should be noted that the Center won't have produced any of these 
shows, no matter how mightily it may strive to make it appear otherwise. When 
Kendrick calls last season's "Gypsy" revival "our production" -- as he did 
recently in a sales letter to tens of thousands of potential subscribers -- it 
is wishful thinking. And misleading. 
</P>
<P>
The Center had no more to do with producing that show, which went on to become 
a Broadway smash, than you or I did. The Center merely booked it, for which it 
deserves all due credit, but no more.

Camarena trial -- A story in Friday's editions incorrectly reported that two 
government witnesses, Hector Cervantes Santos and Enrique Plascencia Aguilar, 
had testified that they had seen Honduran drug kingpin Juan Ramon Matta 
Ballesteros at 1984 meetings where the kidnaping of U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent Enrique Camarena was discussed. In fact, only Cervantes 
testified that he had seen Matta at the meetings.

SHERIFF'S DEPUTY SHOOTS, KILLS PROWLER IN LAGUNA HILLS AREA

An Orange County sheriff's deputy shot and killed a suspected prowler who 
police said had pointed a handgun at investigating officers, authorities said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy was investigating an emergency call from a Laguna Hills resident who 
had reported a man trying to break into a kitchen window, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy, whom authorities declined to name, fired at the unidentified man 
during a confrontation in the back of the house, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
The man was pronounced dead at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center almost 
two hours after the 12:26 a.m. shooting, hospital spokeswoman Jan Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard Olson said that the shooting 
occurred when deputies in the department's Laguna Niguel substation responded 
to an emergency call from a woman living in a house on the 2500 block of La 
Suen Road, near La Paz Road and the San Diego Freeway. The woman, whom Olson 
declined to identify, told authorities that a man was trying to break into her 
kitchen window, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies arrived and walked to the rear of the darkened house, they 
confronted a man, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"They ordered the suspect to raise his hands," Olson said. "When the suspect 
raised his hands, they observed a handgun in his right hand." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Olson said, the suspect pointed the handgun at them, and one of 
the deputies fired. Neighbors reported that two shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
Olson declined to discuss details of the shooting, saying the Orange County 
district attorney's office is investigating.

City Councilman Ernani Bernardi and state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp today announced 
a legal challenge to the city's voter-approved plans to provide partial public 
financing for municipal campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Kopp (I-San Francisco) was one of the authors of state Proposition 73, enacted 
by the voters in 1988, which bans public campaign financing. 
</P>
<P>
He and Bernardi are going to court to halt implementation of the public 
campaign financing provisions of City Charter Amendment H, a comprehensive 
ethics measure approved by Los Angeles voters in June. 
</P>
<P>
Amendment H requires the council to place $2 million each year into a trust for 
matching campaign funds to be handed out to qualifying candidates in the 1993 
election and beyond.

EPA UNVEILS AIR CONTROLS FOR L.A. BASIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today unveiled new air-pollution 
controls for the smoggy Los Angeles Basin and warned that "no-drive days" may 
be imposed on commuters if the region fails to meet federal clean-air standards 
on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But, even as the EPA took the wraps off its long-awaited plan to bolster local 
and state air pollution control efforts, environmentalists charged that the 
federal proposal accomplishes less and takes longer. 
</P>
<P>
"We are discouraged that they propose another three years to meet the ozone 
standard and four years to comply with the carbon-monoxide standard," said Jan 
Chatten-Brown, president of the Venice-based Coalition for Clean Air, which 
joined with the Sierra Club in successfully taking the EPA to federal court and 
forcing it to issue its plan. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said its no-drive day proposal would not be implemented until the year 
2000 and only then as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
Commuters would be forced to give up their cars one day a week and find other 
means of transportation -- preferably ride-sharing or mass transit -- during 
the months of November through February based on the license plate number of 
their car. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Assn. of Governments said it is "concerned" that the 
EPA had failed to include in its plan tougher air pollution controls on 
offshore oil rigs in federal waters on the outer continental shelf and a 
requirement that federal government agencies in the Los Angeles Basin be 
required to participate in ride-sharing plans just like other government 
agencies and private employers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the regional clean-air plan adopted a year ago by the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District, ozone pollution -- the chief ingredient of 
photochemical smog -- would be reduced enough to meet federal clean air 
standards by the year 2007. The EPA would extend that to 2010. 
</P>
<P>
While the AQMD plan calls for complying with the federal carbon monoxide 
standard by Dec. 31, 1997, the EPA is calling for a 2004 deadline, or the year 
2000 at the earliest.

Heavy rains and aftershocks to the deadly July 16 earthquake triggered a 
landslide in a northern mountain highway, killing at least 17 people, officials 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Patricio Dumlao of Nueva Viscaya province said the landslide struck Dalton 
Pass in Santa Fe, 110 miles north of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton Pass, a major route to the Cagayan Valley in northeastern Luzon island, 
had remained impassable because of massive landslides sparked by the temblor 
two weeks ago, Dumlao said. 
</P>
<P>
The 17 fatalities were travelers bound for Manila from Isabela province just 
north of Nueva Viscaya, Dumlao said. On reaching the blocked portion of the 
highway, the travelers left one bus to board another when an aftershock 
triggered the landslide on the rain-weakened mountain, burying the 17, he said.

WHITE HOUSE PRODS DEMOCRATS ON BUDGET

The White House expressed frustration with stalled budget talks and prodded 
Democrats today to come up with their own plan to reduce the $169-billion 
federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"An agreement was made to simultaneously table proposals. We are ready. They 
are not," Deputy White House Press Secretary Alixe Glen said after President 
Bush's latest round of talks with the leaders of Congress. "That's where the 
level of frustration is coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Once the Democrats put a package on the table, "we can continue to move 
forward, probably at a faster pace," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody sandbagged anybody," Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), the 
House majority leader, said after the hourlong Oval Office meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt added: "There may have been some miscommunication about what was 
supposed to happen." 
</P>
<P>
"It's safe to assume that everyone is frustrated. . . . We've been at this for 
83 days," Glen told reporters. "I think all sides would have hopes that we 
would have been a little farther along by this point." 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt said the two sides will decide "in the next few days" whether to keep 
negotiating into August or wait until September to put their plans for slashing 
spending on the table. If they decide to go ahead now, Gephardt said, it could 
mean keeping Congress in session or calling the lawmakers back from vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is when is the best time to try to put together the final 
disagreements, to bridge them and then to put a deal before the American people 
and Congress," Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
If the negotiators wait until September, it will allow Bush and the lawmakers 
to take their summer vacations without embracing controversial packages of 
spending cuts and revenue increases. 
</P>
<P>
But pushing the showdown into September would bring the summit negotiators 
closer to the Gramm-Rudman deadline of Oct. 1, when automatic cuts would be 
inflicted on most federal programs if Bush and the lawmakers fail to produce 
their own agreement.

SOUTER STICKS TO LOW PROFILE IN SENATE TOUR

Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter renewed his low-profile tour of Senate 
offices today, even ducking a reporter's question about exiled New York Yankee 
owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
While chatting briefly with journalists outside one senator's office, the New 
Hampshire judge was asked, "Any kind words for George Steinbrenner?" 
</P>
<P>
After laughing heartily, Souter resolutely skirted controversy yet again. "I 
wouldn't touch anything that hot," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the questions thrown at Souter focused on Monday's release by People 
for the American Way, a liberal group that supports abortion rights, of a 1976 
brief in which the New Hampshire attorney general's office referred to abortion 
as "the killing of unborn children." 
</P>
<P>
Souter, who was the state attorney general at the time, did not write the 
brief. And the lawyer who did said today, "I don't recall him looking at the 
language, talking to me about the argument or approving any line of argument." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Souter declined to comment on the brief. Asked if he thought it would 
play a role in his confirmation hearings, set to begin Sept. 13 before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, he answered, "You'll have to tell me." 
</P>
<P>
Senators on both sides of the issue say Souter will be asked about abortion 
during the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Souter paid courtesy visits today to four senators -- Republican Charles E. 
Grassley of Iowa and Democrats Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Timothy E. Wirth of 
Colorado and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York.

CHRYSLER PROFITS DROP 47% IN QUARTER

<P>
Chrysler Corp. said today that its second-quarter profit plunged 47.2% from 
last year, mainly because of incentive costs. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it earned $180 million, or 81 cents a share, during the April 
through June period, compared to $341 million, or $1.46 a share, during the 
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Second-quarter earnings last year were inflated by $8 million from the sale of 
Chrysler's Gulfstream Aerospace subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Without the Gulfstream sale, its profit would have been off 46% from results of 
$333 million, or $1.42 a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues fell 11.1%, to $8.8 billion from $9.9 billion during the April-June 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
"If not for the huge year-to-year increase in per-unit incentive costs, we 
would have made more money this quarter than we did in the second quarter of 
1989," Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said. The company will not say 
specifically how much it spent on incentives during the quarter, but spokesman 
Tom Houston said it was more than $1,000 for every car and truck sold. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's earnings were in line with Wall Street analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of this year, Chrysler's earnings fell 63.7%, to $251 
million, or $1.13 a share, from $692 million, or $2.96 a share, last year.

Tax authorities today told 14 Japanese securities houses, including Yamaichi 
Securities, to pay a total of $54.2 million in taxes and penalties for 
falsifying tax returns, local media reports said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau would neither confirm nor 
deny the reports by NHK, the publicly financed broadcasting company, and by 
Kyodo News Service, neither of which gave sources for the information. 
</P>
<P>
A Yamaichi spokesman said his company was asked this afternoon by the tax 
bureau to pay additional taxes of $2.1 million for failing to declare income of 
$53.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now considering what steps to take," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Yamaichi is unlikely to oppose the demand, but he upheld the company's 
previous claim that there is no truth to the tax bureau's allegation that 
Yamaichi intentionally made up its client losses by use of warrants.

130 WORKS BY REMBRANDT GOING ON TOUR IN '91

Rembrandt will get his first one-man international show next year, when 130 of 
the 17th-Century Dutch Master's works will tour Berlin, Amsterdam and London, 
organizers said today. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rembrandt's paintings have been on tour before, the September-May show 
will be the first touring exhibition devoted exclusively to the greatest artist 
of the Netherlands' Golden Age, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know there has never been a traveling exhibition on Rembrandt 
before," said Uwe Wieczorek of Berlin's Gemaeldegalerie, which is putting 
together the tour with Berlin's Kupferstichkabinett, Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum 
and London's National Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The Rijksmuseum held the largest previous exhibition of Rembrandt's works in 
1969, with about 20 works on display. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of next year's tour comes on the heels of a major exhibit of 
the works of the 19th-Century Dutch Impressionist, Vincent van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
The four-month Van Gogh exhibit, which ended Sunday, drew more than 1.2 million 
visitors to Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum and the Kroeller-Mueller Museum in the 
eastern Dutch city of Otterlo. 
</P>
<P>
Wieczorek said the plan of the exhibition is to "show paintings once attributed 
to Rembrandt that are now being attributed to his pupils and compare them to 
paintings which we are absolutely sure were Rembrandt's." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the Rembrandt exhibition will mark the end of two decades of 
research into the master's works by art experts. 
</P>
<P>
That research is expected to show that half of the existing 400 paintings 
thought to be done by Rembrandt were actually painted by others, Wieczorek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The exposition will display 50 paintings, 40 drawings and 40 etchings by 
Rembrandt and 45 or so works by his pupils. 
</P>
<P>
Among the paintings to be displayed are "Woman Bathing," "Jeremiah Lamenting 
the Destruction of Jerusalem" and "Mennonite Preacher Anslo and His Wife." 
</P>
<P>
Rembrandt, who lived from 1606 to 1669, is considered the greatest of the Dutch 
Old Masters, who flourished in the 17th Century.

BRITISH BAND TO BE DEPORTED AFTER ARREST ON POT CHARGE

Five musicians and two technicians from the British pop band UB40, arrested on 
suspicion of possessing marijuana, will be deported from the Seychelles, police 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Police Commissioner Raymond Louise told reporters there was enough 
evidence to charge the seven, but authorities had decided to deport them from 
the islands in the Indian Ocean instead. 
</P>
<P>
Conviction for possession of illegal drugs in the Seychelles carries a 
mandatory three-year jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Louise did not say when group members, who were taken into custody Monday after 
police raided their hotel room, would have to leave. 
</P>
<P>
UB40 gave a concert Saturday and their performance was described by the 
islands' only newspaper, the Seychelles Nation, as a technical fiasco. An 
organizer said a bottle of water accidentally fell in the music-mixing 
equipment.

NBC, ABC TIE IN RACE FOR DECREASING VIEWERS;

TELEVISION: RERUNS AND OLD MOVIES DOMINATE THE AIRWAVES AS MORE AND MORE SETS 
REMAIN DARK.

<P>
With network television viewers turning off their sets in near-record numbers, 
all three networks looked like losers last week. 
</P>
<P>
With reruns and old movies dominating the airwaves, NBC and ABC tied for first, 
each with an 8.9 rating and a 17 share, and CBS was close behind with an 8.4 
rating and a 17 share. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday nights, CBS took Sunday and Monday and 
ABC was champ on Tuesday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the 45-week season-to-date competition, NBC has a 13.3 rating and a 23 
share, followed by ABC with an 11.9 rating and a 21 share, and CBS with an 11.3 
rating and a 20 share. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more interesting shows last week, Jane Pauley's "Real Life" on NBC 
had its second outing and wound up in a tie for 21st with Fox's "In Living 
Color," which is down from Pauley's first show the previous week, which tied 
for fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Pauley did win her time period, and she also came in ahead of "Face to Face 
With Connie Chung," which tied for 27th. CBS announced Monday that the Chung 
news magazine will be around in the fall only as a series of specials instead 
of a weekly regular on the lineup, giving its anchor more time to try to have a 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
CBS was the big winner in the Sunday movie competition, with a repeat of 
"Murder Ordained, Part 1," in a tie with "The Cosby Show" for third place. 
ABC's repeat of the James Bond's "Moonraker" tied for 46th, and NBC, with an 
original titled "Johnny Ryan," could only tie for 61st. 
</P>
<P>
Fox had a so-so week. On the up side, "Married . . . With Children" tied for 
10th and "In Living Color" performed well. "The Simpsons," however, was knocked 
out of the top 10 and wound up tied for 19th. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, Fox's new Wednesday lineup ended up on the very bottom of the Nielsen 
list, with "Hollywood Dog" in 88th place, "Molloy" in 89th and "Glory Days" 
wallowing in 90th. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "World News Tonight" with Peter Jennings again was the top-rated evening 
news program for the week with an 8.9 rating and a 20 share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP TV SHOWS 
</P>
<P>

Actress Linda Blair is back and she says the country needs to exorcise a few 
demons. "What irks me is the street gangs who roam around beating up on 
people," she told the New York Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
"I would put them all in a box and ship them off to one of the Eastern European 
countries, where they would learn how good it is to be an American," said 
Blair, who starred as the poor, possessed waif in the 1973 movie "The 
Exorcist." She isn't so sure, however, about how to handle the homeless 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to do something about them," she said. "I don't know what -- but 
anything." Blair co-stars in an upcoming spoof of "The Exorcist" titled 
"Repossessed," in which the devil once again takes control of her.

mer film goddess turned animal rights champion Brigitte Bardot has assailed the 
Islamic world's ritual slaughter of animals as revolting and cruel. 
</P>
<P>
"We are no longer in the Middle Ages and now have every means to curtail the 
pains and terrifying anguish of animals about to be slaughtered," she said in 
an interview published Tuesday in the extreme right weekly magazine Present. 
</P>
<P>
"It is revolting . . . and unacceptable that in the name of religion, man 
should submit animals to such cruel and barbarous sufferings," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bardot, 55, who has devoted herself to defending animal rights since her last 
film in 1973, made her statement after seeing a film of the mass slaughter last 
month of 3,000 sheep by North African immigrants in the Mediterranean port of 
Marseille. 
</P>
<P>
She was said by friends to be especially revolted since she has long campaigned 
for laws to be passed forcing ritual slaughterers to stun beasts before killing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The slaughter of animals during religious feasts is an ages-old tradition in 
some religions. The animals' throats are slit quickly with a single stroke 
under special rules to minimize pain. 
</P>
<P>
Bardot's office said she felt equally strongly about Jewish ritual slaughter 
and Catholic churchmen who blessed foxhunts in France and bullfights in Spain.

Close family members who watched on television as relatives died in the crush 
of a soccer crowd a year ago can claim damages for mental injury, a British 
judge said today. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony Hidden limited eligibility to spouses, parents and siblings of 
the fans who were killed or injured in the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium in 
April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The crush in a standing room area at the Leppings Lane end of the stadium left 
95 people dead and hundreds injured in an FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool 
and Nottingham Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden ruled that those watching the events unfold on TV were just as liable to 
suffer severe mental anguish, or "psychiatric injury" as British law describes 
it, as those who were in the stadium and could do nothing to stop the 
fatalities.

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's chief economic development adviser said today that New 
York state will probably go ahead with an attempt to buy the New York Yankees, 
if team owner George Steinbrenner decides to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo aide Vincent Tese said he doesn't think that any such sale is imminent 
but that New York will be ready to move if conditions change. 
</P>
<P>
Tese said that while he agrees with Cuomo that major league owners would 
probably refuse to let the state buy the team, "that doesn't stop us from at 
least trying, and I think we would try." 
</P>
<P>
"If we get shot down, we get shot down," said Cuomo's director of economic 
development, "but we'll make an attempt." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Tese said, he doesn't think the Steinbrenner family has any 
intention of putting the team up for sale.

former Yankee Dave Winfield. (Story, C1.) In today's order, Vincent spelled out 
his restrictions on the team and its dealings with Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
According to the four-page order, the Yankees must seek approval of "the 
hiring, firing, promotion, demotion or reassignment of any officer of the 
club." The order doesn't apply to the hiring and firing of managers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Yankees must get league approval to sue or file a grievance 
against a player and to hire lawyers and investigators involved with player 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
"Except as otherwise provided . . . no Yankees officials or employees shall 
confer, consult, advise or otherwise communicate, either directly or 
indirectly, with George M. Steinbrenner III on any matter involving the New 
York Yankees or baseball until further order of the commissioner," Vincent 
ordered. "If such communication, either direct or indirect, occurs, a 
responsible club official shall immediately notify the American League 
president." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said any violation of his order "shall be deemed conduct not in the 
best interests of baseball" and will subject Yankee officials "to the 
discipline of this office." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner co-signed the order and in a separate seven-page agreement 
accepted that his conduct was not in the best interests of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Yankees must certify in writing to the AL president every six months 
that Steinbrenner has had no involvement with the team. 
</P>
<P>
In a scathing 11-page decision, Vincent chastised Steinbrenner for starting a 
relationship with Howard Spira, a 31-year-old gambler from the Bronx, N.Y., and 
then for giving Spira $40,000 in January.

STEINBRENNER KEEPS TEAM BUT LOSES WHAT HE LOVED: HIS FORUM 
</P>

Baseball didn't take George Steinbrenner's team away from him Monday. It did 
something more necessary; it took away his forum. 
</P>
<P>
For too many years, The Boss had made the New York Yankees his personal podium, 
almost single-handedly keeping tabloids in the banner-headline business. 
</P>
<P>
Long before he paid Howard Spira $40,000, Steinbrenner had lost touch with the 
best interests of baseball, let alone those of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Agreeing not to take Commissioner Fay Vincent's decision to reduce him to a 
minority shareholder to court might have been the only thing Steinbrenner has 
done for baseball in a decade -- and then, it came because lawyers advised him 
he would lose. 
</P>
<P>
If Pete Rose ably represented the tragedy of greed, Steinbrenner embodied the 
ugliest side of wealth. For years, he hired and fired at whim, belittled 
employees while turning baseball's proudest franchise into a personal toy. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent will allow Steinbrenner to keep a piece of his team, turn his profits 
and enjoy the American system of free enterprise. From now on, however, The 
Boss won't be -- and will need permission from baseball to so much as attend 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Through his actions, Vincent has sent a message that there are limits to the 
indignities baseball will accept. Now, and for as long as it is played, 
baseball must come first. 
</P>
<P>
Under Steinbrenner, the Yankees had ceased being New York's team and became 
George's team. When they lost, he vilified them, sent them to the minors, 
insulted them in print, ordered tickets withheld from certain players' wives. 
</P>
<P>
When fans began chanting an anti-Steinbrenner slogan in Yankee Stadium in the 
early '80s, Steinbrenner told the New York Post: "They can say anything they 
want. I've got their money in my back pocket." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two decades, he feuded with the biggest names in baseball: Reggie 
Jackson, Dave Winfield, Ron Guidry, Dave Righetti, Rickey Henderson, Don 
Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't merely fire good baseball men -- all owners do that -- he tried to 
break them. He broke his word and the rules, frequently. 
</P>
<P>
In Steinbrenner's world, success was measured by $500-million cable-television 
contracts and having his quotes played above New York Mets games on the sports 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
Money was power, until Vincent pulled the plug Monday. Finally, baseball stood 
up to its resident bully. 
</P>
<P>
In the days and weeks to come, Steinbrenner will play the martyr, telling 
anyone who listens that he accepted Vincent's punishment quietly rather than 
drag baseball into courts where, he will argue, he most certainly would have 
won. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter. The man Newsweek magazine put on its cover this week -- as 
the most hated man in baseball -- has been told to go stand in a corner by the 
father figure of the game. 
</P>
<P>
And beginning this morning, New York will have two baseball teams again. The 
game is better for it.

ARLINGTON REJECTS PROTEST, UPHOLDS NEW CUP LINEUP

Stewards at Arlington International Racecourse have rejected a protest 
challenging a switch in the lineup of Saturday's $600,000 Arlington Challenge 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Stewards ruled Monday that trainer D. Wayne Lukas could remove from the lineup 
Criminal Type, the nation's top-ranked horse in the Thoroughbred Racing 
Communications poll. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas will be allowed to enter another of the horses he trains, last year's 
national grass champion, Steinlen. 
</P>
<P>
Heriberto Arroyo, senior steward, said, "Our interpretation is that the 
conditions of the race do not specify a deadline for it." 
</P>
<P>
Gedaliah Goodman, the trainer of the horse Santangelo, had protested the 
substitution, saying the change came after the lineup was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
"Invitations for the race closed on July 20, and Steinlen wasn't accepted for 
the race until two days later," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas pulled Criminal Type from the race after the purse was reduced from $1 
million to $600,000 when Easy Goer suffered a career-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
The race's conditions had called for the reduction if either Sunday Silence, 
the winner of last year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, or Belmont 
Stakes winner Easy Goer was declared out. Arlington officials then accepted 
Lukas' offer to enter 1989 grass champion Steinlen in Criminal Type's place.

LASORDA PUSHES THE POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE SAYS IT'S TOUGHER THAN EVER TO MANAGE IN ERA OF FREE AGENCY, BUT 
DODGER SKIPPER THRIVES ON OPTIMISM.

<P>
The pep talk echoes loudly beyond the ears of those it is intended to motivate. 
</P>
<P>
The deliverer is telling a story about the survivors of a sinking boat who 
decide to swim to shore. They swim and swim and swim, and, nearing land, one of 
them gives up. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have just drowned when the boat sank," the speaker says. "He didn't 
swim 95 yards just to quit at the last five." 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda, this is the story of the final 
days of a pennant race. The players rewarded this speech with division titles 
six times in Lasorda's 14 major-league seasons. In 1988, it pulled off one of 
the biggest upsets in World Series history. 
</P>
<P>
But on a July afternoon in 1990, Lasorda's arena is the Police Academy swimming 
pool. His enchanted listeners are a couple of 11-year-olds. And when the 
62-year-old Lasorda firmly says, "Let's go," they plunge into the water to 
accompany him on another of his 70 trips down the lap lane. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Lasorda's Dodgers have been treading water most of the season, but 
their five-game winning streak has just cut Cincinnati's lead in the NL West to 
seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been optimistic throughout, Lasorda admits his job is getting 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's harder to manage because of the players today," he says. "They 
have free agency, and they don't stick around too long. They're always looking 
for better deals, and the loyalty to a team doesn't exist like it used to. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, when I took over this ballclub, as manager in 1977, 17 of the 25 
players had played for me in the minor leagues." He said that on Sunday, there 
were only two on the field who were signed by the Dodgers, pitcher Ramon 
Martinez and catcher Mike Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
"If other pitchers are pitching and Rick Dempsey is catching, the whole team -- 
nine players out there -- none of them were signed by the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, a guy who bleeds Dodger blue wonders where he would find a 
compatible donor. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he would need one. Since losing 40 pounds on the liquid diet he now 
promotes, Lasorda appears healthier than ever. His shirt says, "Please Don't 
Feed the Manager." And in his photo gallery of an office, he hands out 
fattening candy bars to visitors while munching diet bars himself. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors told him not to run on his battered knee, so he took up swimming in 
March. Those 70 laps -- 7,000 feet -- last week represented a personal best. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's getting younger, not older," veteran Dodger Mickey Hatcher says. 
"The guy comes to the park at 1:30, swims 60 laps, answers his fan mail. He's 
got all the spunk in the world. If anybody should have a drug test, it's him. 
He's the most unbelievable person I've ever seen in my life." 
</P>
<P>
His players still marvel about his positive energy and his fighting spirit. 
These are the foundations of his unique motivational techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a 1,150-1,005 record, Lasorda won't be remembered as one of the 
greatest tactical managers of all time. One of his former players goes so far 
as to describe him as "the worst tactical manager I've ever seen. I just didn't 
care for what he did on the field, especially the way he handled the pitching 
staff. Everybody over there had physical problems." 
</P>
<P>
Those statements came from a pitcher, who added, "As a person, I liked him." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Lasorda might be remembered as the most beloved manager in baseball. 
Former A's outfielder Stan Javier, asked to compare Lasorda with Tony La Russa, 
doesn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"The amazing thing about Tommy is that you see him laughing during a game, 
joking," Javier said. "That's different. Tony wouldn't even smile until the 
game was over." 
</P>
<P>
It has not been an easy year for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't like it the way it is now, no," Lasorda said. "I think we have to 
. . . I think we need Bulldog Hershiser back. I think we need Kirk Gibson 
playing all season. I think we need a healthy Kal Daniels." 
</P>
<P>
Orel Hershiser underwent surgery April 27 and is out for the season. Gibson has 
been hurt for much of the last two seasons and has requested a trade. Daniels' 
knees trouble him periodically. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Howell had knee surgery, Alfredo Griffin has had an aching back, Tim 
Belcher has had shoulder trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of it all, Lasorda puts on the happy mask. Every now and then, the 
local scribes step out to one of Lasorda's unending string of speaking 
engagements to find out what he's really thinking. 
</P>
<P>
On the banquet circuit, they've heard: 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I think? For the money some of these guys are getting paid, I 
think they should have a clause in their contracts saying they have to pay the 
club $150,000 if they don't make the All-Star team." 
</P>
<P>
And: "Nowadays, if you fine a player $200, he says, 'Hey, Skip, let me go to my 
change box and get it.' " 
</P>
<P>
If any of this bothers Lasorda, his players don't notice it. They swallow his 
spaghetti sauce by the spoonful. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the World Series, things haven't been great," Dempsey says. "You can get 
tired of losing. But Tommy is always regenerating. Every day he feels we're 
just about to start a long winning streak."

ONCE-HIGH-LIVING TUSTIN DEVELOPER FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY; 
</P>
<P>
DEBT: MICHAEL F. HARRAH, WHO FORMERLY OWNED A THEME ATTRACTION NEAR LAKE HAVASU 
AND COLLECTED CLASSIC CARS, IS CLAIMING ALMOST $30 MILLION IN LIABILITIES.

<P>
Flamboyant Tustin developer Michael F. Harrah -- former owner of the English 
Village theme attraction near the London Bridge at Lake Havasu, Ariz. -- has 
filed personal and business bankruptcy petitions in federal court here, 
claiming nearly $30 million in liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Harrah listed only about $8,000 in personal assets and the unspecified value of 
his 20% interest in the Ramada Lake Havasu resort hotel owned by Harrah Corp. 
Unlimited as his only business asset. 
</P>
<P>
In his personal filing, Harrah also listed an unspecified debt to the Internal 
Revenue Service for unpaid federal income taxes from 1985 through 1989. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Don Teague, said Harrah -- once a high-living multimillionaire -- 
currently lives in a rented home in an unassuming mixed residential-commercial 
neighborhood in central Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Harrah, who listed a business address in Tustin but who works out of the 
offices of a Fullerton-based building company, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 6-inch developer listed numerous lawsuits and judgments by 
developers and former business associates among his liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Teague said that in filling out the bankruptcy filings, he listed every 
possible debt and claim "because we didn't want to leave anything out." Thus, 
he said, Harrah's personal and corporate liabilities were likely overstated. 
</P>
<P>
A review of some of those debts bears out Teague's disclaimer. 
</P>
<P>
The suits and claims apparently stemmed mainly from disputes over payments for 
or performance on various development projects, although the largest is a claim 
for $10 million in damages by Orange County restaurateur Geril Muller. 
</P>
<P>
Muller is suing over Harrah's use of the name Ambrosia for a short-lived 
restaurant he opened in Costa Mesa in 1986. Muller founded the original 
Ambrosia in 1975 and operated it until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Harrah later leased the facility from Muller and opened his own restaurant, 
where the menu featured buffalo and alligator steaks and where a special space 
was set aside for Harrah to display vehicles from his classic car collection. 
That collection apparently has been sold, as Teague said Harrah's only vehicle 
is a late-model Dodge pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
In at least two cases, debts listed by Harrah no longer are owed, or even 
claimed, according to attorneys for the companies listed as creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Harrah's petition for a Chapter 7 liquidation of his business said the concern 
owes $3 million to Lakeside Palace Associates in Lake Havasu City and an 
unspecified amount to an air-conditioning company there. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, however, the Phoenix-based attorney for Lakeside Palace 
Associates said the suit by a condominium homeowners group over construction 
defects was settled more than six months ago when Harrah Corp.'s insurance 
carrier paid substantially less than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
And Lake Havasu City attorney Randall Bartlett said that Lake Havasu Air 
Conditioning was listed as a creditor based on a 1986 suit dismissed in 1987 
with no judgment. 
</P>
<P>
One of the larger creditors listed in Harrah's filings is Western Empire 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn., an Irvine-based thrift recently seized by federal 
regulators. The filing says Harrah's company owes Western Empire $3.2 million. 
The filings also show a $105,000 debt to American Commerce National Bank in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Teague said that Harrah's troubles stem from his sale in the late 1980s of most 
of his interest in what then was called the Queens Bay Hotel in Lake Havasu 
City. 
</P>
<P>
He said Harrah was to receive $9 million for 80% of the hotel -- now the Ramada 
Lake Havasu resort. But the buyer subsequently went into bankruptcy "and the $9 
million cash turned into a $9-million note that (Harrah) couldn't collect," 
Teague said.
